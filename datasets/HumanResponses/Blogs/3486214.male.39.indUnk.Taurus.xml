      What is KeePass? Well, in the words of the author:      KeePass is a free/open-source password safe or manager which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key-disk. So you only have to remember one single master password or insert the key-disk to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish).  I'm really stoked on this app for a couple reasons: first, it has a killer feature that allows you to keep your master password on a thumb drive. So.. if your thumbdrive is plugged in, you have access to your passwords. If you take off to work (and take your thumb with you) your home passwords are secure. In this example, the thumbdrive is the key – and the encrypted passwords are still stored on the local machine. The second approach I like is storing the entire app and passwords on the thumb drive. This is cool because no matter where you go, you just launch the app and type in your master password, and you're set. No need to install the app again as you move from machine-to-machine, it just runs from the thumb drive without the need of any external dlls or anything… pretty nifty.  To sum up – it's probably the best password safe I have seen to date, and I love the fact that it's open source and free!   urlLink Download Here

      Hi everyone. All looks safe for now but I would advise that you make sure your Anti Virus program is up to date.  Still if you use Mozilla you are protected much better than if you use Internet explorer.

      It pulls from 4 networks: EDonkey, Gnutella, Bittorrent, and Shareaza's own network, Gnutella2. So the odds are higher than ever that you'll find what you seek! Shareaza has a built-in media player and zero popups. Cool graphics on torrents, too. Give it a whirl and let me know what you think.

      Microsoft, Yahoo, AOL, and Earthlink are joining forces to find a caller id for email system that works. User authentication is considered by most experts the only effective way to eliminate spam. The Anti-Spam Technical Alliance issued 21 guidelines for fighting spam on Tuesday. The companies say they hope to settle on a unified authentication system by next year.

      Do You Remember The Movie X-Men?   Could This Be In The Future?  Somewhere in Germany is a baby Superman.  The boy has muscles twice the size of other children his age and half their body fat. Born with bulging arm and leg muscles, he can hold 3kg weights with arms extended even though he is not yet five.  DNA testing showed why: The boy has a genetic mutation that boosts muscle growth.   The discovery, reported in yesterday's New England Journal of Medicine, represents the first documented human case of such a mutation.   The mutant DNA segment of the Berlin boy - whose identity was not disclosed - was found to block production of a protein called myostatin that limits muscle growth.  The news comes seven years after researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore created buff 'mighty mice' by 'turning off' the gene that directs cells to produce myostatin.   'Now we can say that myostatin acts the same way in humans as in animals,' said the boy's physician, Dr Markus Schuelke of the child neurology department at Charite/University Medical Centre Berlin.

      The e-mail wars heated up as Microsoft announced a massive increase in storage capacity for its free Hotmail customers, countering Yahoo as the two rivals look to head off a challenge from Google.   Microsoft said it would offer its free MSN Hotmail customers in "multiple markets" 250 megabytes of storage, up from 2.5 megabytes. That is more than double the 100 megabytes offered for free by Yahoo, which recently boosted its capacity.   Both Microsoft and Yahoo are seeking to fend off a challenge from Google, which plans to offer free e-mail accounts with a full gigabyte of storage capacity, representing some 500,000 pages.   Microsoft said it would start making upgrades for its 170 million customers worldwide, along with free anti-virus scanning of incoming e-mails, in early July. The new capacity limits take effect "later this summer."   Separately, Ask Jeeves, which operates several Internet portals, said it would offer users 125 megabytes of free e-mail storage on its My Way, Excite and iWon portals starting in September.   Most free Web-based e-mails had been limited to two to four megabytes, requiring users to delete old messages to stay within the limits. The newer capacities will mean most users will rarely, if ever, have to clean out their old e-mail messages.   The moves come as Google, which is in the process of offering stock to the public, prepares a free e-mail service with an unprecedented one gigabyte of storage. The Google plan has drawn criticism from privacy activists, however, because it will target advertising to users based on the content of e-mails.   The battle for free e-mail highlights the falling cost of storage capacity but also a rush to direct customers to portals and search services, which can generate revenue.   David Hallerman of the research firm eMarketer said Microsoft, Yahoo and others are trying to keep their users from defecting to Google to be able to pitch advertising and other services.   "With the cost of memory being what it is, (the expansion) is not that high a cost," Hallerman said.   "They were pushed into this move by Google. This is a way to keep people on their site. This is the razor to sell the razor blades."   "This move was not unexpected -- e-mail is the hook for an overall relationship with consumers, which leads to the creation of an audience for advertising," added Forrester Research analyst Charlene Li.   "If Google, Yahoo, and MSN can hold on their e-mail users, they stand a much better chance of ensuring that they use other services such as search."   Danny Sullivan at Searchenginewatch.com said Google's planned Gmail service offers an advantage in that it allows users to search quickly through their e-mail messages.   "That's what a lot of people have missed in the talk about a gigabyte of storage," Sullivan said.   Sullivan noted that Yahoo also allows users to search their e-mails, but Google is much faster.   As for Hotmail's expanded capacity, Sullivan said, "it's great but it doesn't mean anything for Microsoft unless they give you the ability to search through the material quickly."   At this point, Sullivan said, "Yahoo is in some ways ahead, because they are already providing all kinds of storage and they're doing it right now."   But he predicted Google may still catch up and grab many users because of its features and its "cachet."

      The trade group for the major United States record labels says it has sued 482 more people for copyright infringement in a continuation of its anti-piracy campaign.   Including the latest suits, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has now sued 3,429 individuals since last September as it seeks to discourage music fans from copying and trading songs through peer-to-peer networks like Kazaa and LimeWire.   The RIAA again used the "John Doe" litigation process, which is used to sue defendants whose names are not known.   The trade group began using the "John Doe" method in January after an appeals court ruled that Internet service providers like Verizon Communications do not have to provide customers' names to recording-industry investigators.   The RIAA plans to discover the identities of those it targeted in lawsuits through court-issued subpoenas.   Despite the suits, millions of people continue to use peer-to-peer networks to copy music, movies and other files directly from each others' hard drives.   "Illegal downloading continues to cause enormous harm to the entire music community," said Steven Marks, general counsel of the RIAA.   "We must stay on the path of education, enforcement, and offering great legal services."

      St. Louis - Ken Griffey Junior gave his dad a Father's Day gift in St. Louis.          Griffey today nailed his 500th career home run, a solo shot leading off the sixth inning against Cardinal starter Matt Morris. He's the 20th player to reach the milestone and the sixth-youngest in that group to do so.          Griffey's teammates went onto the field to congratulate him after the historic homer. He then went to a box next to the Reds' dugout and hugged his father.          Three other active players have hit 500 homers. Barry Bonds is third on the career list with 676, Sammy Sosa has 549 and Rafael Palmeiro has 538. Fred McGriff needs seven homers to become the 21st player to hit 500.

      Ounce again the race is ended under caution. That sucks at least let them race back to the finish. And I believe it should never end under caution when you are on the last lap. Nascar needs to do something or they are going to hurt racing as we know it. Too many new rules.

This world will never be the same since the Twin Towers. What do we have to do to realize that if we are going to be involved in what other countries do we have to stop policing the situation and act like it is a war and do what we have to do.

Yes it can be used for illegal copying. But what about the Law abiding citizen? Shouldn't they have the right to backup their already paid for software?

      TAMPA, Fla. - No, Canada. The Stanley Cup not only isn't headed north, the Tampa Bay Lightning are taking it south. Ruslan Fedotenko scored twice, including the critical first goal just as he did in the conference finals, and the resilient Lightning held off the Calgary Flames 2-1 in Game 7 Monday night to win their first Stanley Cup.  The Flames, threatening to become one of the most unlikely champions in NHL history, were held to only seven shots in a dismal first two periods before making a frantic late surge started by Craig Conroy's power-play goal midway through the third.  Lightning coach John Tortorella insisted throughout the finals that his team would win only if his best players outplayed Calgary's _ and they did exactly that. Fedotenko scored on goals created by Brad Richards and Vincent Lecavalier, and goalie Nikolai Khabibulin held off Calgary's late flurry while Flames star Jarome Iginla was again held scoreless.  Tampa Bay joined the 2001 Avalanche as the only teams to overcome a 3-2 deficit in the finals in 30 years, with the Lightning finally ending their record 13-game streak of alternating winning and losing by winning Game 6 on the road in overtime and Game 7 at home.  Maybe it's only coincidence, but in each series a 22-season veteran who had never won the Cup finally did so. Colorado's Ray Bourque did it in 2001, and 40-year-old Dave Andreychuk finally lifting the Cup after playing a record 1,758 games without winning it.  Bourque called the Lightning's Tim Taylor on Saturday to offer advice on how to deal with coming back from a deficit, and to wish Andreychuk good luck.  Now the question is how long the Lightning will rule. The NHL's labor agreement runs out Sept. 15, and all signs point to a lengthy lockout that will significantly delay or shut down the 2004-05 season.  The Flames, going for a 11th road victory in 14 playoff games, were convinced that failing to close out the finals Saturday in hockey-obsessed Calgary wouldn't cost them the Cup, since the home team had won only twice in the series. But home ice did matter _ just as it almost always does in Game 7.  Home teams are 11-2 in finals Game 7s and 10-1 since 1950, with only the 1971 Maple Leafs winning on the road in the last 54 years.  Once again, there's no place like home ice in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals.  It didn't help Calgary that Iginla, the impact player of the first five games, all but disappeared in the final two, going more than four periods without a shot. Iginla scored a playoff-leading 13 goals, but had only one in the final four games.  The team scoring first had won every game in the series, so Tampa Bay got a huge confidence booster when Fedotenko scored on a power play 13:31 into the first _ much like he scored the go-ahead goal in a 2-1 victory over Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference finals.  Brad Richards' shot from the point was kicked away by Miikka Kiprusoff to Fedotenko in the slot, and he lined a shot past the goalie.  That goal was one of several uncharacteristic Calgary defensive breakdowns as the Lightning forced the play from the start, limiting the Flames to only three shots in the first period and four in the second.  Robyn Regehr, Calgary's most dependable defenseman, played despite apparently injuring an ankle or foot in Tampa Bay's 3-2 overtime victory in Game 6 and was on the ice for Fedotenko's goal.  Fedotenko's second of the game and third of the finals was created by a dazzling bit of stickhandling by Lecavalier, who hadn't figured in any scoring since Game 2. Lecavalier took Cory Stillman's pass in the left corner, spun around to shed defender Steve Montador and another defender and put a perfect pass on Fedotenko's stick in the slot with about 5 1/2 minutes left in the second period.

      Most audio CDs are not protected by encryption, which means that those who legally buy such CDs in the US have far-reaching rights as defined by Fair Use. You can backup your CDs, of course, but you can also take tracks off of your CDs and create compilations, sample and mix tracks, or add your music to DVDs you're making. The RIAA is working in conjunction with DRM firms Macrovision and SunnComm International to develop a technology that would put limits on these kinds of actions. (You may remember SunnComm from the "just hold down shift and bypass it" days of CD copy protection efforts). In short, they want to limit the number of times you can copy anything off of an original CD, and they want to make it impossible to copy anything off a CD that was burned by a user. Additionally, they expect to see similar technology deployed in online music sales, as well.   If implemented widely, the new technology would mark a substantial change in the way ordinary people can use purchased music, possibly alienating some customers, analysts said. Given the costs of piracy, however, the labels are moving ahead cautiously in the hope of striking on a formula that works. "There is a fine (DRM) balance that nobody has struck, especially with physical CDs," said Mike McGuire, an analyst with the GartnerG2 research group. "If there's somebody who's making 25 copies for the world and finds they can't do that, then few people will probably complain. But if someone finds they can't make a copy for their kid so he can play it in the car, you're going to have a lot of people returning broken CDs."  What the RIAA and News.com fail to understand is that "copying" is not limited to whole albums or just recent purchases. The very promise of digital music is that you can transfer it, copy it, encode it (lossless), etc., without any loss in quality. Just think of a single track that you really like. Aren't chances pretty high that in your lifetime, you'll burn that track out to a CD for whatever (legal) reason more than just a few times? Apple has already realized this, and that's why their burn limitations are based not on the songs themselves but on playlists.   And of course, if they're really after the big pirates, they should realize that such copy protection isn't going to stop those who seek to derive financial gain from piracy. Much in the way that DVD's CSS just prevents legitimate users from exercising Fair Use rights under the guise of "fighting organized piracy," this solution will only inconvenience and irritate the career criminals while treating the rest of us like we're criminals, too.

      TAMPA, Fla. -- In Game 7 of a Stanley Cup final, anything can happen. A winner emerges from the opportunistic bounce of a puck, a loser spends years replaying mistakes that occur in a millisecond yet alter the outcome of a nine-month season.  "It's hockey at its best," Calgary's Steve Montador said.  At least that's the story line portrayed before all final-round Game 7s, including Calgary against Tampa Bay at 8 p.m. today in St. Pete Times Forum.  Usually, though, it's only a myth. If history holds up, the Lightning not only forced win-or-else game tonight with their 3-2 double-overtime victory Saturday in Calgary, they effectively won the Stanley Cup.  Of the 10 Stanley Cup final Game 7s since 1950 -- so long ago, even Lightning captain Dave Andreychuk wasn't playing yet -- nine were won by the home team. The 1971 Montreal Canadiens were the exception, winning Game 7 in Chicago to complete a comeback from a 3-2 series deficit.  Overall, home teams are 10-2 in championship Game 7s, with the 1945 Toronto Maple Leafs being the only other road winners. The previous four Game 7 winners -- the 2003 Devils, 2001 Avalanche, 1994 Rangers and 1987 Oilers -- won at home.  Of course, home ice has meant almost nothing in this series, with both the Flames and Lightning going 1-2 in their arenas. Calgary won Game 5 in overtime Thursday in Tampa before the Lightning broke the hearts of thousands of Stanley Cup celebrants-in-waiting Saturday in Calgary by winning Game 6.   "It's a proper way to end this series ..." Lightning coach John Tortorella said.

          DID YOU KNOW?    As you walk up the steps to the building which houses the U.S. Supreme Court  you can see near the top of the building a row of the world's law givers and each one is facing one in the middle who is facing forward with a full frontal view  ...  it is Moses and he is holding the Ten Commandments!     DID YOU KNOW?    As you enter the Supreme Court courtroom, the two huge oak doors  have the Ten Commandments engraved on each lower portion of each door.     DID YOU KNOW?    As you sit inside the courtroom, you can see the wall,  right above where the Supreme Court judges sit,  a display of the Ten Commandments!    DID YOU KNOW?     There are Bible verses etched in stone all over  the Federal Buildings and Monuments in Washington, D.C.    DID YOU KNOW ?    James Madison, the fourth president, known as "The Father of Our Constitution" made the following statement:   "We have staked the whole of all our political institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God."    DID YOU KNOW?   Patrick Henry, that patriot and Founding Father of our country said:   "It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by Christians, not on religions but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ".    DID YOU KNOW?   Every session of Congress begins with a prayer by a paid preacher,  whose salary has been paid by the taxpayer since 1777.    DID YOU KNOW?     Fifty-two of the 55 founders of the Constitution were members  of the established orthodox churches in the colonies.    DID YOU KNOW?     Thomas Jefferson worried that the Courts would overstep their authority  and instead of interpreting the law would begin making law . an oligarchy ...  the rule of few over many.    DID YOU KNOW?    The very first Supreme Court Justice, John Jay, said:  "Americans should select and prefer Christians as their rulers."    How, then, have we gotten to the point that everything  we have done for 220 years in this country is now  suddenly wrong and unconstitutional?

      NEW YORK - The spiritually inclined band Creed, whose anthemic hits "Higher" and "With Arms Wide Open" helped them become one of the top-selling rock acts of the past decade, has called it quits.  Three former Creed members immediately announced they were forming a new band _ minus singer Scott Stapp _ but were quick to say it was not "just Creed with a different singer."  Creed's three albums sold a combined 24 million copies in the United States. While many critics dismissed them as pale Pearl Jam imitators, Creed members used that as creative fuel and laughed all the way to the bank.  Lyricist Stapp grew up with a strict religious upbringing and often explored those topics in song. At one point five of the first eight queries on the "frequently asked questions" section of the Florida-based band's Web site dealt with Christianity, including "Is Creed a Christian band?"  The band always said no.  Stapp and guitarist Mark Tremonti were longtime friends and songwriting partners whose relationship soured in the past couple of years, as Tremonti explained in a recent interview with MTV.com.  That caused tension in the band. "There was a lot more drama," drummer Scott Phillips told The Associated Press on Friday. "It wasn't necessarily created by anyone in particular. It just stopped being fun."  Stapp was not available for comment, said a spokesman for Wind-up Records.  Creed took most of last year off, and reconvened in the winter to come up with new material. "The vibe just wasn't the same," Phillips said.  Still, they weren't about to casually disband such a successful unit. The band had initially figured on taking a hiatus, but a side project was working out so well they decided not to turn back, Phillips said.  The new band, Alter Bridge, features Tremonti, Phillips and former Creed bassist Brian Marshall. Singer-songwriter Myles Kennedy, formerly of the band Mayfield Four, was recruited as the fourth member. Their first album is due out in August.  Phillips described the music as edgier than Creed, with the musicians given more space to show off their chops.  "We don't want to make it seem like it's just Creed with a different singer," he said.  Stapp's first solo recording will be on a soundtrack of music inspired by the film "The Passion of the Christ." He's working on a solo album with the Canadian band the Tea Party.

      UPN's "Amish In the City" shows us our modern selves in a mirror that is positively medieval. By Chris Armstrong  It began last night like a tasteless joke: "Knock, knock. Who's there?

Those who keep watching this show can expect a far more interesting dynamic than the "let's-see-if-we-can-make-the-innocents-sin" project. That is, we'll continue, as we did in the premiere episode, to see the "city kids" squirm. And we, if we're honest, will likely do a little squirming ourselves.
