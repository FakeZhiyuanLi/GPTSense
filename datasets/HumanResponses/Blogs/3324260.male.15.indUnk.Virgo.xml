      omg i had to much fun this weekend ok i went to a camping trip w/ most of my closest friends when it was pitch black me,jason,and travis went for a long walk we came across a pay phone and i said "hey we could mess w/ people but we have no money" so travis called freakin 911 i thought i hanged up in time so the call didnt go though but when we walked like 10 feet the pay phone rang i was freaked out but travis answered it as a pizza place and the cop said its cool...later we got to this abandand street and since mark is always thinking hes cool because he took a shit in a public place so i tryed but i couldn't shit so i tryed to piss couldn't do that either but on are way back i pissed on a sign so thats cool...be got back on this beaten road when we were walkin back and this car i though looked like a cop car was stopped at this gate and i was sitting there for like 5 mins i was freaked out agian the car opened the gate and was coming by us we ran  but then tryed to act natural and it went past us and i was cool agian......while walking more these kids said for really far away on a field "who are you strangers" and I yelled "none of your ****ing bussiness" and we ran it was fun..we went back to camp and then all my homies went on another walk we got to the beaten path,we saw a huge burst of blue light it was a prefect cirle im very superstitious and i got freaked out like usally do and me and james walked back on are walk back we saw the whole sky light up w/ the blue light (it couldn't have been lighting because we didn't see anymore the rest of the night and I don't think it looked like lightning either)...after everyone got back to camp everyone went back to sleep ex. me,mark s.,and jason we stayed out till 1:30 but james's dad forced us back to sleep...this was the coolest weekend i remember
