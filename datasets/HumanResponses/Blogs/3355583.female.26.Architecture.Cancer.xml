      So I went to my family home to take care of some things and it was crazy, there was so much dog shit everywhere, it made me want to puke, and it was so embarrassing for me to bring my friend home.  I mean really, what am I going to do with this?  How did I come from these people?  Sometimes I really wonder...So I cleaned up my things and got my stuff together and it was somewhat good. But I felt so embarrassed.  Now my ex wants to come to Edmonton to do a "face to face".  I'm afraid.  I'm afraid that he might do something crazy or something completely dramatic.  But in the end, I would rather be free of him than completely the object of his obsession.  And he seems to confuse love with obsession.  I don't know if he can make the distinction...  The friend I brought home is a good man.  I see that.  There are some good men in this life and he is a good one...

      So I am also inline to take over the family business.  It's quite substantial.  I'm going to say no.  Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm not.  I just want to walk away from the money.  I hate it, it ruins everything, it drives everything.  Blame it on my youth...  Please check out this  urlLink cat , he's, well, fabulous..

      So, as I continue...I moved back to my home town.  What is it with being twenty-something, and coming home?  It's weird; the whole town seems a lot smaller than when I left and it's funny how much you forget (locations, peoples names that have lived here for years), and even funnier how much you do remember (where you first got drunk as a teenager, and name of the place where you registered for university).  I mean, it's strange how many people do not change.  We got older, some of us got married, some of us just plain put on weight, and some us are having children.  I can't even figure out what I will eat for lunch much less plan for a child.  It's beyond me, and at the same time makes me feel like a child, even though I have very adult responsibilities.  Maybe it's because of the relationxhip I was in.  It was a relationship that, in hindsight, was doomed from the start.  When you begin a relationship, you have the utmost respect for the other person and hope for the future.  Somewhere along the line, the idea of the future kinda died, and I am left with this really weird hole to fill.  Like I was always part of a couple, I could do "couple" things on holidays and special occasions.  I could come home to someone welcoming.  But it wasn't like that all the time, which begs the question, "Why?  Why did I stay so long?"  I guess it was comfortable, and that in itself is enough to drive anyone batty if the opportunity presents itself.  I guess it's part of my culture to.  I went to my cousin's daughter's birthday, and in typical fashion I get asked "So where is your boyfriend?  Do you have one?  Aren't you married yet?"  What in the hell does that mean?  I am in my mid-twenties, and I guess this IS the time that one get's married, but I am not there, does this make me defective already?  I hope I am not...

      So since this is a revival of my old blog I thought I would re-introduce myself.  I am a young single gal living in, well, sometimes it feels like the middle of nowhere, but really it's a great little town on Alberta Canada.  Single you ask?  Why yes, because of many things out of my control, I am single, and deeply confused by the new deal I am in.  The man I was with, the man I thought I would spend the rest of my life with is now officially not a nice man at all.  How could I have been so blind you ask?  Well, that will come with time...  I work for a corporation which shall remain nameless.  It is great in a lot of respects, but no one ever starts out saying "Hmmm, I hope I grow up to work for "the Man" someday..."  At least I didn't.  But I did make some fabulous friends and have had some great experiences.  Let me back track I guess.  A year ago, I was living in Toronto.  Yes, I know, Toronto.  Home of the Leafs, comedy, Muchmusic and Mike Meyers.  It was in alot of ways great, but I was hooped in a lot of ways too.  And then my ex-boyfriend came back from Jamaica, and I apparently lost my nerve to make it on my own, and came back to be with him.  I must have lost my mind.  Anyways, that is a whole other story.  I moved back to Alberta, where I got a good job (read :better paying) and moved back to my home town.  It was like Northern Exposure.  I forgot what it was to live in this city, or again, I must have lost my mind.  But regardless, it gave me just enough perspective to realize that this man was not for me.  And it's not that he was entirely bad, he wasn't entirely good either.  It just never felt quite right.
