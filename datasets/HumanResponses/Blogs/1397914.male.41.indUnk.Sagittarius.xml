      Today was nostalgia day here at the house.  Dean decided that he wanted to crank up some of his old (80's, early 90's techno) CDs. It was fun for awhile but it started interfering with my hangover after about an hour.

       urlLink statesman.com    After being thrown out of a bar, Russell, 33, got involved in a scuffle with Renny, a 3-year-old German shepherd and member of the city's K-9 Corps. Renny and his human partner were dispatched to investigate a disturbance at the bar from which Russell objected to being ejected.  Syracuse police said Russell grabbed the dog by the throat, choked it and bit its neck. William Foster, Renny's police partner, used force to get Russell to release the dog.

Not quite sure how I came up in their conversation (there's three years between my working with them) but it's nice to a part of me (good I hope) stuck with them.

Not only because the smothering humidity in Austin had faded and my hair was showcasing its ability to produce the perfect spiral curl -- but more importantly because I was among the fortunate few at a screening for the long-awaited sequel to the original kick-ass Wachowski brother action film, "The Matrix."   At least she will like the movie.

      Today was my and Mark's one year anniversary at Healthsouth. It was pretty quiet today. We spent my last 45 minutes listening to some kid singing the Pokemon theme song over and over and over while his grandmother was in therapy. He was still going at it when I left. I was going to call Mark a couple of times just to say "pika pika" but I figured he'd suffered enough.

      Dean and I took Max and went down to Corpus Christi Saturday. It was the first time in a long time that Dean and I have had the same days off. Dean actually suggested the trip a week ago. I agreed, as long as we could find a kennel or someone to watch Max. That was pretty much the end of it until Saturday morning.  As usual Dean waited till the last minute to put everything together.  I found a few hotels that accepted pets around 10 in the morning and bookmarked it, but by the time he crawled out of bed most of the ones that had reservations available were booked. We did manage to get a reservation at a Days Inn (which wasn't too bad). Then we rented a car and by 6 we were on the road.  Corpus has changed alot since I left in '91 but some things are still the same. Lots of construction, strip malls. They still haven't finished the causway out to Padre Island. The Hidden Door is still the only gay bar in town. There are a couple of girl bars, but...  All in all though it was a pretty good weekend. Dean and I went to the Hidden Door Saturday night (I drove by it twice). We played a couple of games of darts. Sunday we checked out of the hotel and went to the beach for awhile. Max loved the dunes but hated the water. Then headed back to Austin.

I ordered a "regular" steak burrito. It came wrapped in foil and looks like two pound roll of ground beef.  The burrito was pretty good.

Whiney admitted that when she's at a real starbucks she usually gets the fru fru stuff then went to get a cup of regular (cheap) coffee.

      Second Monday in a row!  Although I did manage not to rip the back off of my cell phone like I did yesterday. The bus broke down and my connecting bus picked up two wheelchairs; which made me about ten minutes late for work  (ok, I was already late and the wheelchairs added maybe 2 minutes) . Then the cafeteria was out of cantaloupe and I dribbled coffee on my shirt and yes I would like some cheese with this whine.

      Well, we're starting week two of the "Garland Wars" here at the office. It's Dee and Linda verses Shirley and Theresa. The big debate is whether the garland on the counter in the lobby should be centered or draped over the edge. It gets changed every few hours or so, depending on who walks by. I'd tape the silly thing down but we're not supposed to use tape for things like that (wouldn't be "pristine").

The system that does payroll went down, as well as the fossil of a printer that we use to print the end of day reports. Did someone slip in a Friday the 13th and not tell me?
