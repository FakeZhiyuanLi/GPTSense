      I have a number of blogs all over the wide open plains known as the World Wide Web. For some reason, however, blogs on this site constantly catch my eye. They are organized, colorful, and did I mention,  organized  (something I personally am not)? So we'll have to see how long this one holds up. I'll still maintain my Xanga, simply because I have contact with more people there.

      I had something in mind to post the other day, but I'd already posted something and I don't want to be posting 2x in one day anymore, so I was going to wait... now I can't remember. Haha.

      Ever since Wednesday when I discovered I could no longer fit into a skirt I could fit easily a year ago, I have put myself on restrictions in terms of when and what I can eat. As loony as this may sound, it's really not. I'm not starving myself. I could never do that. I am, however, limiting what goes into my stomach after 8pm each day (i.e., nothing except for liquids or a piece of fruit). I'm also trying to eat regularly at normal times, instead of eating breakfast at 3pm and lunch at 8pm and dinner at 12am... something like that. I'm also going to attempt to work on at least 3x a week. I hope this works, because there is no way anyone can get me to go all Atkins or Slim Fast. Blech! Wish me luck.

      I've recently been looking into renting an apartment (once I start work in August, most likely... although I'd like to move out now). I've narrowed my locations to Sammamish // Issaquah // South Bellevue, due to the nature and location of where I will most likely be working. If anyone knows of any  good  apartments with few problems (if any), please let me know your recommendations. Mucho gracias. :)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  Now onto the next portion of my post - how do I edit these crazy tags on this crazy template so that I can make links to friends' blogs? I'm trying to make sense out of the help pages, and you'd think that for someone who used to be so into web pages that I'd know what to do, but I have noooo idea! It could be that I'm just too lazy to read up on it and really understand... in any case, if you can help me with THIS, it would be great, too. But I'd rather hear about the apartments. Or both. ;)

      Sorry for being such a brat, Ryan. But thanks for the hookup with the Gmail! It made my day. Hmm... does the fact that getting Gmail made my day make me weird? I guess I already knew I was weird already.  On another note, I went down to U Village to Lucy to check out some new workout clothes because they were supposed to be moderately affordable. Well, for now, I think I'd rather go to Target. Not because it was too expensive or not cute... but because I am feeling so out of shape right now (NO JOKE) that I don't think my body DESERVES to be dressed in cute, slightly more costly workout gear.  Arrgh.

      Google is pretty smart, I have to admit. They are creating this frenzy for Gmail accounts simply by limiting the number of accounts/invitations that are given out. It's pretty much just like Prohibition and alcohol, except that it's for e-mail, of all things. So now everyone just *wants* a Gmail account (yes, I admit it, I really do want one), even though there may be privacy issues with the way they scan your messages in order to target ads to you.  How pathetic that it's making me get on my knees and beg!!! But if anyone out there has an invite, please send me one. :) Oh, and I guess I can't leave my Hotmail address on here because those effers block Gmail invites, so please use  urlLink jcyang212@yahoo.com .  Now I feel like a beggar. Haha.  P.S. I will be "lifetime" grateful!!! I'm not sure if I can say I'll be "eternally" grateful, although I'm sure it's possible that I could thank you when I'm in heaven.

      ...with Blogspot is that I feel pressured by other blogs to actually write in coherent, full sentences. Usually, when I'm posting on Xanga, I just write whatever I feel like and don't even use proper punctuation or capitalization. Here, however, I feel compelled to make sure that every "'t' is crossed and 'i' dotted" for some reason.  Anyway, since Ryan has a food blog, I guess I will make this partially a food/spa/travel blog. Wow, that leaves a lot of loopholes, doesn't it? ;)  Last night, we made linguine alfredo with canned tuna. Sounds exotic, eh? Not really. I'm never buying Chicken of the Sea tuna again. "Chunk Light" tuna, my a$$. They should label it "Pulverized Pulpy" instead. In the end, of course, it all tastes the same and goes down the same tube, but you know what they say... you eat with your eyes.  I also stir-fried some spinach - Chinese-style, simple, "qing chao" vegetables with a bit of garlic, oil, and salt. I must say that for plain spinach, it tasted pretty good.  In other news, we tried to go to the Rick Steves store in Edmonds on Sunday, but it was closed. Thanks to my genius self, I convinced him that the store was open from 12-4pm. "I'm pretty sure it is!" I'm getting a little anxious about planning our trip - more so just because I want to KNOW where we're going to go and WHAT we're going to see and WHERE we're going to stay. Hmm, I put the emphasis on non-parallel words in that sentence.  See what happens when I'm forced to actually write sentences?  Wow, this is getting pretty long. I guess I'll put off writing about my incompetent class project group until later.

      So... although I'm pretty sure no one reads this and the one or two people who do read it are getting sick of hearing about the topic, I'm talking about Gmail again.  This time, however, it is on behalf of my friends (two of them, to be exact) who I'd really like to give Gmail to. However, I don't have any invites myself, and even if I did have one, I'd be torn as to who I would give it to because I don't want to piss anyone off.  Anyway, I stumbled upon the  urlLink gmailswap site  and tried (so far, with no success, although it seems like other people have been lucky) to get some invitations for my friends. I must be pretty desperate... but I don't see it like that. I'm just lookin' out. ;)  Sooo... if you readers of my blog have anymore invites to give out or know someone who is willing, please email me!   urlLink jcyang212@yahoo.com   ^_^  Thanks.
