       I can't sleep..      I dreamt that i'm lost in this buildings with my friends the other night.. There's chaos everywhere.. But we don't know what was happening. We just follow the crowd. When we reached this highway bridge, I saw Han's in front. I wanted to go after him, But suddenly a war just broke out, I was hit by a laser gun. Then i just slowly collasped. My soul was still around, but i can't find Han, my friends or any of my families..      Hmm... Wonder what dreams will i get tonight..? I have a very bad feeling about it... gd night everyone.. Sweet dreams...

        Hai.. Didn't go to Sentosa today.. Why??? Because i'm not feeling well... AGAIN!! Of all the times to be sick... ='( Been wondering the whold day what were my classmates doing.. I bet i missed out all the fun.. and bonding too.      Hee... But i get to bond with Han.. So maybe that's not really that bad after all.. Luckily he came to see me.. Or else.. I wouldn't want to cope up at home alone on such a wonderful day..      Hmm.. Ok, I need people to act my school project very desperately!! By this saturday!! Anyone interested please e-mail me ok? Thank you very very very much! =D      Ok now... Why the above title? I don't how to say or explain.. But you could say i'm being paranoid or sensitive again. Hmm.. I also don't know.. I guessed i'm feeling too emotional to say anything.. Hey people, If you think this blog is very boring tell me or post me a message ok? I'll try to squeeze EVERY BIT OF LIFE i can find on me. Though i doubt it lah.. Wahahahaha...(-_-)'' I'm becoming nuts..      How do you define "lame" and "funny"? Actually there's a very thin line between these 2 words. Hmm.. Maybe I should check the dictionary. Han told me that if the next time people call me lame, I should say,"  I'm not lame! See, I'm walking perfectly !" Hee.. I wouldn't want to try this, But i'll be very interested in what the other party will say! =9      Ok... Hope I'll feel better tomorrow.. I'm really feeling miserable now, and i just ate another big bowl of porridge just now! Ah... I'm bound to have indigestion tomorrow again.. See.. Me and my big fat mouth.. Take care everyone! Gd nite..        Yeah!!!!!! S.H.E!!!!!!! (=^-^=)v

       Eh... Hello!      I just came back from outside. Watch two movies (or rather 2 vcds) with Han.. Heh... The 1st is Beautiful Boxer. It's a thai movie about this very famous boxer who is a homosexual... Very interesting and sad... The 2nd one is the Truman Show. It's more touching than funny... It's really amazing, It's about this guy who has been living in this so called "perfect world" and have been filmed since he was borned. Everything has been arranged for him, the friends he made..etc Even the girl he was to marry was also arranged by the direction and TV crews! He thought that he was living in a normal world but he isn't. The director made him lived in this so called "perfect" world.. Terrible...       Ate macdonald today again.. Hai.. I think i'm gonna have a hard time when school starts.. AEROBICS... (-_-)'' I have been eating non-stop!!! Must control.....      Sometimes wonder if i'm lame or boring... Sometimes i think i fit perfectly to what Han has decribed those girls who he think are lame or act cute.. Sometimes i try to think of something to say to my new friends, but they either made no response to what i said or they would start to talk among themselves.. Sometimes i'm so fed up that i'll just keep quiet rather that say sumthing rubbish and have people think that i'm act cute or lame. I just want to be myself... my bubbly cheerful old shelf... Like what Han and the others had asked me..: What has happened to the old Ah Bin? I can't answer that question myself too...      Eh... Should i go for the poly class gathering at sentosa on wednesday? Hmm... I'm afraid that I'll be left alone there again... Really want to play and enjoy myself too.. I also have my playside side of me too... Q told me to go and get myself bonded with the class... Hmm... Hope it will work..       When may told me that she was getting very well with her classmates.. I don't know why but i have this strong negative feeling.. I even said nasty stuff to her.. Feel so guilty... ='{ Ha! You guys must have though that it was jealousy, didn't you? No.. It wasn't.. I guessed.. I'm just afraid that she'll forget  her old friends...      Woah.. I wrote quite alot.. And i haven't started studying for my MEDISOC yet!! AH!!!! Ok, I shall stop here.. Take care all the pepole out there! And pepole who are in np, enjoy yer break! For people who are not in np, hang on there! Cheers!!! =)

       Yea!!   today's the start of my 1-week break!! Finally we can rest... I think i will go crazy if without this break.. SERIOUSLY!      But we have only 1 paper for common test- Media in society. So it's 2-weeks break actually!! But then again.. with all those studying and projects... I doubt i can really relax... But hey, it's better than no break!      Hai... Feel so tired and stress and lonely... I have been asking myself if i have done something wrong or made a wrong choice... Yea... Coming to np.. Studying MCM... Meeting new friends.. This is what i want!! Or rather i think i want... But why do i feel so tired? I've no answer to that too... What's wrong with me??? X'O      Maybe i'm like what my other friends say... I'm too sensitive... Yea.. i think i am too... Sometimes i feel like everybody don't like or want me as their friends.. Or i'm so extra or outcast... I know i'm irritating u guys by saying this. But it's easy for you guys to say: No lah, you aren't! or Can you stop saying everybody dislike you? Sometimes i feel like all the bad things can happen to me alot of times. And i really mean "ALOT" of times. Can someone please just come up and tell me that i'm wrong about myself...?       I want to go back to my old self... the cheerful side of me... What has become of me now? This isn't me at all! I can't recongise myself...    I must wake up!! WAKE UP AH BIN!!! Shouldn't put myself in misery.. especially the people around me.. And it's just the start of the break! Sorry guys.. Cheers!!! =]
