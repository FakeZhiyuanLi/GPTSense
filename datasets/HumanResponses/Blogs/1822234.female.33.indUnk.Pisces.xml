      what an end to my week.  It's been a little crazy, and I only have myself to blame. You see, there's this bar,  urlLink Martuni's , and whenever I go there I seem to get into some sort of stupor.  Knowing very well that I had a job interview on Friday morning at 11:00am I proceeded to down 2 drinks, which at this fine establishment is the equivalent to 4 drinks.  Did I mention that I didn't eat any dinner?  What a swell idea!  By the time we decided to depart I think I might have shared some thoughts (with my outside voice) about some of the open mic singers and swapped a few inappropriate comments about my former job to my replacement and my friend who still works there.  I shared a cab to the BART with the replacement fella and have no recollection of the conversation we might, or might not have had.  I do remember giving him an inexplicable hug and kiss on the cheek for making sure I got to the BART safely.  I also remember almost falling down the stairs of the BART.  Knowing if I would get on the right train was quite an ordeal and I think I might checked my palm pilot with the BART schedule 87 times.  When my Superman (a.k.a. brilliant husband) came to pick me up at the BART station I had to pee so badly that I wasn't sure if we should stop somewhere on the road or if I should just wait ...  I made it home, but it wasn't pleasant.  Now let me set this straight, I'm not writing about this because I'm proud of it (although I think it's comical and tragic at the same time).  I'm actually quite ashamed.  It's embarrassing and I feel like if I write it down I'll feel like I'm absolved from my guilt.  I think the saddest thing is that I followed just about the same sequence of events the last time I went to this very same bar.  So my solution is to do to one of the following a) never show my face in Martuni's again b) never go to Martuni's with these two gentlemen again b) tell the wait staff when I walk in there that I have a problem with this place and please only give me one drink c) if I exhibit this wretched behavior again I should at least get up and sing a song at the piano, giving others the chance to make fun of me.  Needless to say, I was quite ill the next day and almost didn't make it to my interview.  It was a humbling experience and I hope to never repeat it.  After all my bitching and moaning about not having a job I go and try to ruin the chance I have at getting one.  And I also have to say that if it weren't for my brilliant husband I would have never made it through Friday at all.  He really knows how to take a hangover and turn it into a day of accomplishments.  I didn't know I could learn so much from him about such things, but this relationship just keeps on giving.  So I've learned my lesson, and walk away from this experience with a little less dignity than I had a week ago and a new box of Pepto Bismol in my medicine cabinet.

      Our  urlLink power was out  for a good portion of the day yesterday, which was actually kind of nice.  I had gone out to lunch with a friend from my old job and when I got home I couldn't do anything really productive around the house so I sat outside and painted for a little bit, which I probably wouldn't have done if I could have been vacuuming, or on the computer...etc.  I have made it a rule that since being unemployed I can only watch a maximum of 2 hours of TV a day, otherwise I would probably be sitting there all day.  (but I don't count movies, I can't let my Netflix go to waste!)  When I was a kid my Mom used to let us watch 2 hours of television a day and my sister and I would use the TV page that came in the paper on Sundays to choose very carefully, sometimes I would use a blue pen to circle what I wanted to watch.  I remember that I never watched cartoons when I got home from school because if I wasted my hours in the afternoon I would miss out on Happy Days or Laverne and Shirley or, god forbid, Charlie's Angels.  I used to love that show even though I don't think that I ever stayed awake during an entire episode, I guess I just wanted to fit in.  I was reading the paper this morning and saw something about this  urlLink product  to let you monitor how much time your kid is spending on the computer or TV.  I'm a little unclear on this though, I mean couldn't you just tell them to turn it off?  And do you need to get one of these units for each appliance that your child might abuse?  I think that it's a pretty good tool for kids that are home by themselves a lot, but it makes me a little sad to think that parents have to turn to these gadgets instead of a mutual relationship of trust and respect with thier children.  I also think that the cartoon on the website is a little creepy, and the motto "it's hard to argue with a box"... no doubt, but don't you think that the kids will still argue with the parents who control the box?  I don't have any kids, so I suppose I shouldn't pass judgement, but I remember "the look" from my Mom would work wonders, no gadget needed. While I'm on the subject of TV I'm just going to get this out of the way now... I love reality TV.  It's a secret (not so much so now) shame of mine.  There was a point when I would watch every reality show that came on, at least the first episode, to see if it was any good.  But thankfully I'm past that stage and I've narrowed it down to few.  I must admit that I did watch  urlLink Meet My Folks  the other night.  It's terrible.  The best thing about that show is the lie detector guy who shows up in the last 15 minutes.  The lie detector test itself is lame, but the dude who runs the machine totally rocks my world.  He has a killer comb-over and he laughs at not only the bad questions but will frequently chuckle when someone lies.  I hope that someday he busts out into a hardy guffaw.  But more than that I hope that I'm never driven to watch that show again.... it's really bad.

      for some reason today was my angry day.  Angry when I got out of bed, angry when I took a shower, at the store, in the parking lot (but that a given). I'm not sure why I'm this angry but I feel a little resentful today and I'm kind of regretting quitting my job.  Don't get me wrong, I hated that job.  I'm glad that I don't have to clean up after actors and I'm glad that I don't have to take people to and fro in a dirty company car, but I miss the companionship that I had in an office everyday.  I miss the structure to my day and I miss being able to feel free at the end of the day.  Yeah, I know, I'm free all day right now, but it's different when you sit at a desk all day and dream about the things you'll do when you go home and when you actually are at home all day. When I see or talk to my friends from my old job I secretly want to hear them say "yeah, this place is really falling apart without you" or "it's just not the same now that you're gone, I think I might leave, too"  okay, maybe not that drastic, but it's always nice to know when you've made a lasting impression and things really aren't the same without you.  Doesn't everybody want that?  I never imagined when I quit a job I hated it would make me feel so bad. So I guess that's the root of the anger.  And I try to get myself out and moving around and seeing new things everyday, but I really am unadventurous and I think that I may need a little guidance.   I also feel a little bad because I think my cat has caught on to the fact that I'm angry - he's been hiding under the bed all day and I can't get him out. It's okay when it just messes with my day, but this poor cat has no where else to go.  Sorry, buddy.

      Today was the first time I experienced a hot day in San Francisco.  Not that I spend a lot of time over there, because after all, I live in the East Bay, and for some reason find it crippling to cross the bridge.  I met up with my pal Wil and we did some window shopping while sweating.  I think it's the first time I've sweat (without being on a treadmill or rowing machine) since we moved out here two years ago.  We stopped in the first store that was open and I thought something was wrong with me because I picked up a bag I thought was kind of neat and suddenly sweat was pouring down my face.  I thought to myself "I don't like this bag that much", it's clearly been a while since I've dealt with any kind of heat.  Nevertheless, I thought the sweating was okay, because I miss the summers in Boston.  A little sweat helps me to remember what season it is.  I still find it a little confusing when I can eat Thanksgiving dinner on my patio with a t-shirt on.  The window shopping was pretty fun, but I got to feeling a little sad, being jobless and all.  Even though I couldn't afford most of that stuff when I had a job there was at least the potential.  Now it's just a giant wish list of things that I don't really need.  Things like glassware and vases and books.  Coffee table books.  We don't even have a coffee table.

      and thus begins my attempt to journal all that is not exciting.   I rearranged the storage closet in the apartment.   urlLink it's Anti-Procrastination week  .so I figured what better time than now to put the vacuum and ironing board in places that are easy to get to.  good times.  I also washed a lot of dishes, had some friends over for dinner last night.  Really missing a dishwasher...  I'm not very hungry, but I'm thinking about going to Taco Bell.  I really can't think of a better way to  urlLink "buy a vote" for the recall election .    Since being unemployed I'm really reaching for things to do.  I've never had this much time off in between jobs and/or school and it's been hard for me come up with my own stuff to do... instead of having my day planned out for me.  I know I should be enjoying this time, but I'm finding that relaxing is not something I excel at.  Maybe I need some slacker training or something.  I remember when I was working I would dream about things I would do if I had free time.  So here's the free time, now what do I do?

      i think i ate too much.  that's got to be the worst feeling in the world.  okay, maybe not the worst, but it's pretty bad.  i feel like i should take a nap... greg suggested i go to the bathroom, sean said "no, greg, that's just a guy thing."  i then confessed at how it's a mom thing, too, and told them how my mother would always say "well, just take a book in and try, just  try ".  i laughed, and then my face turned red.  embarrassing, yet so funny.  I was talking to Sean today about what a bad kid I was growing up and I think I'm going to take a little time to apoligize to my sister.  I beat her up somethin' awful when we were kids, and back then I never felt bad about it, but I sure do now.  I can't really remember all the incidents, but I do recall a time when I punched her in the stomach so hard it made her sick, another time I scratched her on each side of her face and she had to go to school with my ugly nail marks on her face.  I have vague memories of chasing her with a steak knife.  Terrible.  When I think about it now it makes me sad, I had so much rage I clearly thought it was okay to treat somebody like that.  And the worst part is that she always wanted to talk it through and sometimes wouldn't even fight back.  No, the worst part is that I don't ever remember being punished for the things that I did.  I'm sorry. what was I thinking? Once I got past fighting with my sister I moved on to sassing my mother, always a worthwhile hobby while in 8th grade.  I got pretty good at it.  I know my mother heard it all, but she did a damn fine job of ignoring it.  Except for the day I became princess of the universe.  You see, the most important 13 year old in the world simply cannot have a calculator that the  whole  family has used.  It was USED!  I needed it for math class, we all had to bring one in, and I refused to be embarrassed by that scratched up thing.  It was solar powered, what if the lights went out?  It was supposed to have all sorts of neat functions and this was a piece of crap.  Just numbers and a display.  Was it from Sears?  The buttons weren't even big enough, look, I can hit two at the same time, I'll fail math!  It didn't even have a name brand.  My father would have to take me to get another one when he got home, and since this calculator was the only one at my immediate disposal there was no way I was even going to think about doing my homework.  I couldn't do my homework with  THAT !   That was the beginning of the end.  I stormed up to my room, gleeful that I was victorious and would be receiving a new calculator posthaste.  I flopped down on my bed grinning to the ceiling when the red, raging face of my mother suddenly hovered over me.  She thrust the calculator in my face and said "This is what you'll be taking to school with you!"  I opened my mouth to speak but nothing came out, it was then I realized that my mother wasn't hovering over me... she was sitting on me, cutting off my air supply like an anaconda.  She went on and on about how that calculator would be only calculator I would ever get and I better hope I don't break or lose it.  All I really remember is that I couldn't believe my mother was SITTING ON ME.  and she kind of spit when she was shouting.   Sure, I deserved it, I was a total brat.  I can't believe my mother never hit me.   After the incident I took a safety pin and carved my initials in the metal face of that calculator, even though it was still the "family" calculator, that would show them.   I got in trouble for that, too.

      and so another week goes by and I realize that I still don't have a routine down.  I want to get up early and do pilates, make a healthy lunch to take to work, have a productive day at work, come home, have a nice dinner, do something relaxing and then go to bed at a reasonable hour.  Actually, after putting that in writing it doesn't look so appealing, but neither does what I'm actually doing... which is spending a lot of time just sitting in bed thinking about what I should be doing, watching too much TV and going to bed way too late.  I guess I should give it a little more time, it's only been 3 weeks at the new job and I still get cranky about that commute. I actually spent a lot of last week angry, mostly because I had a cold, I did a fair amount of belly aching about how miserable my life is.  I feel better today and with the tell tale sign of the end of a cold, the always elegant peeling nose, I think that I should note some things that make me feel happy, because I shouldn't spend any more time being negative.  * the fact that my cat doesn't know how to meow, but opens his mouth like he's trying * the man at the toll booth who wears  urlLink novelty glasses  and always asks if you need a receipt * Alex * mashed potatoes * Jack Black  * clean sheets * Puffs Plus tissues with lotion * packages from my Mom, especially when I'm not expecting them * Old Navy pajama bottoms * pictures of my nephew * living close to the ocean * shoes * tomatoes and basil from our porch garden  there, I feel better now.

      Apparently my new hobby is completely over scheduling myself in my free time.  And I kick ass at it because last week I booked so much to do that I'm a little dizzy on the recovery and I may be a little dehydrated. I guess I figure if I have to sit in a car for about 2 hours everyday I should fill in every cranny of free time with FUN.  That's right, you heard me, I said that I AM GOING TO HAVE FUN.    So last weekend... it wouldn't be a weekend if I didn't kick it off by wasting all my hard earned money on meals out that I can't afford.  Friday night it was  urlLink Montero's  with Alex, Max and Julianne.  A good time and good food (and lots of it) was had by all.  Although those chips tend to be a bit  greeeezy and Max had to take one for the team... he went to the restroom and got paper towels because the wait staff simply couldn't get any napkins to us for the first 20 minutes we sat there.  They pretty were busy, it was Salsa Dance Night, after all.  I ate way too much food and then we hung out at M and J's place.  Somehow we ended up watching all the different shopping networks you can get with the dish and it turned out to be pretty hilarious.   urlLink This  was my favorite item.  Saturday was the  urlLink YABA  treasure hunt with RM and our other team members Amy and Cort (we were "4 Angry Monkeys").  Greg and I took the BART in together, but he was in a whole other league, so we made it a point not to speak to each other once we arrived.  Actually we lost each other in a sea of 300 or so people.  From the administrative side of the race I would say it was a disaster, but the puzzles were fun... at least the ones that we got to.  I could go in to great and many details about the race, but because I haven't written in a week and I know I'm headed for major finger crampage already I'll just sum it up:  we solved some puzzles, some that were kind of hard, then we walked.  We walked a lot.  We walked all over San Francisco and messed up a few times, so we walked some more.  And then we were at the halfway point.  Where they gave us more puzzles, which meant more walking.  Here's where my massive over scheduling hurt me;  I had to be home at 6pm to go to opening night of Much Ado About Nothing... when we reached the halfway point it was about 3:30.  The race ended at 5, so we still had a fighting chance.  Okay, I didn't really think that, but I did want to finish the race out.  Alas, I stranded my team members (but they were okay with it) at Embarcadero and took BART home.  I'm not sure how we did, but considering it was my first one of these thingies I felt pretty good about making it halfway.  I had a more fun than I thought I would and I liked being an Angry Monkey for the day.  Then it was home to shower and go to  urlLink CalShakes .  Sara, who is in the show, is staying with us and her boyfriend flew in from Alaska, so we had a merry little group of me, Alex, Jeff (the boyfriend) and Rachel (mutual friend to me and Jeff).  I like CalShakes because you're outside, and we were fortunate enough to have some fab weather.  But I also like it because you can bring your own supplies and eat and drink before, and during, the show.  It's pretty great to be able to have a nice bottle of wine while you enjoy a show.  I won't say a lot about the show, because mama always says that if you don' have something nice to say don't say anything at all.  No, it wasn't  bad and there were some super performances, but it wasn't my cup o' tea.  We hung out afterwards and schmoozed a little, you know, the opening night kind of schmoozing, and then home again home again jiggity-jig.  Sunday I drove Alex to work/school at 8:30am, always the prompt student, and then gave Wil a call to see what he was up to.  Brunch in the city it was.  So I crossed the bridge and ate a deee-licious salsa omelet at  urlLink Kate's Kitchen  and then somehow ended up spending the rest of the day in the city.  Iâ€™m glad I had a sweatshirt on (by default, you see, I had never really gotten dressed that day, my outfit was a variation on my pajamas) because our last stop turned out to be  urlLink Comedy Day  in Golden Gate Park.  Even though the rest of the city was sunny and warm, the park was fogged in and we were freezing our bippies off while sitting on the wet grass without even a towel.  I need to know when I'm going to attend one of these events, because I'm a planner by nature and instead of enjoying the comedy (which was hard with some of those warm up comics) I couldn't stop thinking about all the things I could have brought with me.  I was also thinking "can anyone tell these are my pajamas?" all day, but as it turns out when you walk around on Haight street no one really gives a shit.   Finally at around 3:00 I decided it was time to go home, because my ass was wet, I was pretty darn cold and I wasn't even laughing that much.  Did I mention that one of the comedians was the woman who does the Pine Sol ads?  yep, it's true.  I went home, picked up Alex, we got some Chinese food from our favorite place and had a nice dinner with Sara and Jeff.  wheh, what a weekend.  The beginning of the week goes something like: drive, work, drive, eat, sleep.  Repeat as necessary.  Wednesday was kind of fun because I went to the opening of Les Liaisons Dangereuses at  urlLink A.C.T. .  I also got lost while driving into the city.  That kind of sucked, but on the up-side of getting lost goes a little something like this: Wil directed me (via cell phone, yes, it was hands free) to some cheap parking and I realized I knew where I was at one point because I had been there during YABA.  See, my week is coming full circle.  I wasn't crazy about the show at ACT, that's two in a row, is this why I left theatre?  The ironic thing is I've seen more theatre in the past week than I did for the last two years, when I was working in one.     Thursday is always exciting... when it's the season premiere of  urlLink Survivor ! And everyone can give me crap if they want, but I don't care what they say, Survivor rocks and I'm going to watch it until Jeff Probst shrivels up and dies.    Friday... which now means the end of the week to me, opposed to my last job, when I was on call all the time, and Friday meant nothing.  Greg and I carpooled to work, which was nice, because my voice is starting to get a little hoarse from singing like a rock star on my way to and fro work.  Friday evening Alex and I met up with Mike, who always makes me laugh, at the  urlLink Albatross .  We had a few beers, thought about playing darts, Greg joined us with his super cool dog and we laughed a lot.    This Saturday was a day to relax, Alex and I got up at 10:30, ate breakfast, read the paper, gave the cat a bath (okay, maybe that wasn't too relaxing), and then did some window shopping.  A much needed day together.  RM and Greg came over later on and we drank wine, played games and ate Chinese food.  We even pondered the possibility of Bingo again... I don't think I can avoid it forever.  Today is a day to clean.  Now that's what I'm talking about, I think I'm back in the rut once again, and maybe I don't mind so much.  So even though I thought I did myself a huge disservice by packing my schedule so tight for a week that I couldn't even zip it up, I had a great time and I have no regrets with my choice of leaving my last job.  I'm starting to like it out here, and that feels nice for a change.

      welcome to the working week... I guess it takes a lot more out of me than I remember.  And gosh, I only was out of work for five weeks.  Any longer and I just should have retired, because this work week is wearing me thin.  I gotta get back into the groove.  The 45 minute commute (each way) isn't something to write home about (although I can rock out and fantasize about how fab I would be at karaoke).  After 45 minutes in the rattling Saturn I'm faced with training for a job that has never existed, so no one really knows/wants to train me.  I kind of feel like I'm "self-training".   And this is the third job in a row where I've had to do this.  I was thinking that my skin got thick enough after the first two times that this time shouldn't really stun me, but I'm down for the count.  The challenge has proved to be worthy, and I won't be defeated, but I could use a cheerleader.  Or a mascot. On the positive side: OFFICE SUPPLIES!  I can go into a room (that's right, not a closet, a  whole room ) and get whatever sort of office supplies I want.  No, I'm not joking.  Tammy took me down there and I was a little modist to start out, but once she got a box for me and started throwing stuff in herself there was no stopping me.  I was on a roll.  And that was only Monday.  I resisted going back down there on Wednesday, because twice on Tuesday felt a little shameful.  But there I was again today.  What!?  I needed binders, which, by the way, are not in the supply room, it's a whole seperate location.  I have no shame when it comes to a Sharpie and a nice legal pad.  So working isn't so bad, I'm liking it and I think I'll keep going in. I mean, what the hell, they're gonna pay me, right?  right?  My boss told me I look "over enthusiastic" in my ID picture.  I can think of a handful of things that might be worse.

      Yesterday Alex and I drove over to  urlLink SCRAP  to check out what kind of junk we could get.  We walked out empty handed, but had a lot of fun looking around at stuff.  It was a little overwhelming, mostly because I didn't even have a project in mind.  So we spent about a hour in there poking around at carpet samples and busted tiles.  Then we drove around the city, thinking we might give Chinatown a shot, but came to find out that there was some sort of  urlLink festival  going on and parking was a bitch.  It was too bad we didn't think to take the BART because it looked like a lot of fun.  I really wanted to go to Chinatown because they have this kick-ass (illegal) urlLink chalk  that keeps those t-tiny ants away.  I love the chalk, sorry EPA, I'm gonna keep using this stuff.  One time I saw a trail of ants getting bigger and closer to the porch door leading into the kitchen, so I thought I should nip it in the bud.  I drew a semi-circle around the corner all the ants were coming from and then wrote "ant free zone".  Okay, maybe that was a little on the malicious side.  The next day I was watering the plants and was surprised to find mass carnage within my witty semi-circle.  I felt terrible.  It always felt okay to get 'em when they were near the cat food on in my stuff, but this was pointless and I felt bad for at least seven minutes. So no Chinatown or miraculous insecticide chalk for us on Saturday, but we did end up driving to  urlLink Russian Hill  to have a little lunch and then we were back home to do a big bunch of nothing.  Watched some  urlLink bad  TV and thought about going to a movie.  Sometimes you just have lounge.

      My last official day of unemployment wasn't a complete bust with thanks to some of my friends.  Mostly RM, who called me on Thursday and asked if we should do something on Friday. I started my day with a slice of pizza, a cup o' coffee and the news and cartoons of the SF Chronicle, then I thought about doing laundry, but didn't.  Finally took a shower and headed out for lunch with Julianne and Max.  We met up at  urlLink la Mediterrane , which is one of my favorites.  Although, I must admit, that nothing can beat a cheeseburger and coffee for lunch, I would eat it everyday if I could, but that would be disgusting.  After lunch I came home and did the dishes, which I hadn’t done all week.  Those ones at the bottom of the pile were really gross.  I also got rid of that left over salmon from a few weeks ago and some moldy cheese.  Awesome. Then RM called from the BART, I went to pick him up and got stuck behind this really old dude who, of course, was picking up his wife at the same BART stop.  I did some deep breathing to relax myself and kept the road rage under control.  Unlike the other day when I decided that it was appropriate to honk and shout out "what’s your damage?!" to someone who apparently was learning how to drive.  sorry ‘bout that.  RM and I couldn't decide what movie to see, and ended up seeing  urlLink Thirteen .  I knew the film wouldn’t be uplifting, but I wasn’t expecting that.  The performances were great, but I thought the downward spiral was little too deep and I didn’t have enough time to recover.  I also thought they drove the same point home a little too much.  Not a good choice for a "summer movie", but no one claimed that it would be, so perhaps we should have gone with Uptown Girls.  Or would that have been more depressing? RM was into the idea of Bingo and for some reason that scared me.  Maybe because I can’t see in the windows of the bingo parlor, maybe because I never see anyone go in or out or maybe because they take Visa and MasterCard.  I had this picture of us walking in there and all these old ladies would start laughing at us, wondering what these whipper snappers wanted anyways?  What are we doing on their turf.  It would be like a gang war.  but safety in numbers… there would be four of us, me, RM, Alex and Greg, would that be enough?   Alex was home when we got back from the movie and Greg joined us later.  We ate, thought about bingo, and then ended up playing some of the board games that Greg keeps in his car.  That’s what I love about Greg (among other things… like getting me a job), he keeps games in his car.  We played two train games, RM winning most, if not all of the time.  It was a nice way to end my month of nothing.   I have to admit, thinking about it today, I’m a little sad that we bailed on the bingo.

      Okay.  I got another job, so the month off is over and I welcome the work week back into my life.  There are only so many things I can search on Google, I’m ready to be productive for pay.  my last official day off is tomorrow… what should I do?  I’m sure that something uneventful will take place.  I can count on me for that.  I found myself watching Oprah today.  I try really hard not to do that, because I’m not a fan, and frankly her fans kind of scare me.  Oprah has become an industry and that bothers me.  Does she have to be on the cover of her magazine every month?  Perhaps that’s what sells it, but I don’t see the draw.  I also get irritated when I want to buy a book and it has that lame “O” of approval on it.  I’m glad Oprah got everyone reading more, but the seal of approval isn’t what makes me buy it.  A few years ago I bought  urlLink  I Know This Much Is True   by Wally Lamb and after riding the train a few times with it I realized that I was embarrassed and needed to cover my O of shame.  I chose to use a sticker of a smiling strawberry and blueberry holding hands, for some reason I thought that this would be better than the golden O.  Anyways, the show today was a handful of inspiring weight loss stories.  Some people had lost 300 pounds.  Incredible.  I was forced to watch it because I was in awe of the success of these people.  And all these people thanked Oprah because she inspired them to lose the weight, so can she really be that bad?  I have to admit that I shed a tear or two, but when I saw Oprah cry I thought “Oh, cut it out, you’re so full of crap!”  But then I realized… maybe I’m too hard on Oprah, deep inside that one woman industry is another weight loss success story, and maybe she remembers the pain.  So I’ll let my grudge go (for today), but I won’t take that sticker off my book.  whoa, if I'm not mistaken that was an  urlLink earthquake .  Usually my cat gives me a swift hit to the face when an earthquake is on the way, but he was still sleeping this time.  I guess he’s getting to old to be the natural disaster patrol.  When we lived in LA he was always ready, I could depend on him to wake me from a sound sleep.   I have the wacky  urlLink news  station on in the background, and it’s pretty funny because they’re trying to make the most of this and asking people to call in.  So far it’s been 6 old women saying that they were lying in bed reading and they thought a truck was going down the street.  “No, nothing fell off the walls, no, I didn’t hear anything.”  Perhaps they should get back to the news, after all  urlLink Ah-nold  had a new ad air today... doesn't anyone want to talk about that?

      We're prepping for Halloween, doing a little haunted house action for the kiddles in the  urlLink University Village .  As if the rows and rows of townhouses aren't scary enough.  I'm thinking it's going to turn out okay, but since I am a natural worrier I have thoughts of the following: what if a kid gets hurt?  lawsuit?  will this give kids nightmares?  will I be burning cruel memories into their tender brains?  will angry parents come and find me the day after Halloween to complain?  Will the guilt be worth it? But of course I'm still going through with it.  Our buddy Keith is up from LA, a professional in the scary business... he's good at getting you to jump.  So far we've hung the lights, done all the shopping and figured out the layout, now we just need to get it up and running.   Brings back memories of  urlLink Spooky World , a classic white trash Halloween activity.  Now, I ain't putting Spooky World down, I'm just saying you have to have a little of the WT (isn't it funny that WT can mean both white trash and wide track?) in your blood to really enjoy the wonder of Spooky World.  My uncle used to take me and my sister there, and I admit I found it on the scary side, but mostly because of the patrons.  If you're looking to see some fine mullets this is the place to go, my friend.  I'm assuming that most folks like to indulge in a little drink or smoke before heading over to this horror theme park, but I found it intoxicating all by itself.  From a blacklit haunted house staffed with fluorescent clowns to the Celebrity Barn it says "klass" all the way.  The first year we went we were lucky enough to see celebrities  urlLink Linda Blair  and  urlLink Tiny Tim  (God rest his soul).  I'm not quite sure why they do the celebrity thing there, because it's not what draws the crowd in... just go to the website and take a gander at who they are calling celebrities this year.  That's scary right there.  At any rate those memories will always be close to my heart; there's nothing like a  urlLink guy  chasing you with a chainsaw while you're on a hayride, or an  urlLink alien  sneaking up behind you while you're waiting in line for said hayride.    I don't think our haunted house in Albany can ever compare to good ol' Spooky World, but I might have a chance to bring a little WT into this Halloween.  Trash bags, check.  Black lights, check......

      what a week... once again overbooked and crazy, but that's better than over worked  and crazy, so sign me up for another week. This past weekend Alex and I had the pleasure of spending the weekend with Max and Julianne.  It included such items as a delicious dinner, a trip to Healdsburg, a concert of classical music and a very memorable "lost hour" between the hour of 2am and 2am on Sunday.    Max and I get to meet up with a high school friend of ours, John (or Johnny, as I like to call him) every once in a while.  He is part of a  urlLink string quartet  and when he breezes through town we're always lucky to hear from him and get free tickets to his concerts.  He met up with us in the East Bay, convenient and close to home .... we all had dinner at  urlLink Nizza la Bella  which will now be one of my favorites, and dangerous, because I can walk to it from my apartment.  We then headed over to the Albatross for some drinks and to meet some other folks from high school.  It was a more than a little wacky when Matt, a prom date from 1988, came in and said hello.  That's just the kind of thing you don't think about everyday, especially when you're all the way across the country from where you grew up.  I really don't remember the prom that well, but I do remember that I wore white pumps and a crazy lavender dress that didn't really fit me.  I stuffed my bra in an attempt to even things out and while dancing a tissue worked it's way free.  I wouldn't have noticed it, but luckily everyone on the dance floor was eager to point it out.  Did I mention that I had a short hair and a rat tail that went down to the small of my back?  I dressed it up with a little silver bow that night.  A class act, all the way.  Needless to say it was a little awkward to meet up with people I haven't seen for about 15 years in a loud bar on a Friday night, but I made it, with the awesome assistance of Julianne, who is the best at striking up conversations... I'm the worst at that.  The next day was a little bit of relaxing, a little bit of packing and a lot of sweating.  I always forget how hot it gets out here in October.  We (Alex and I along with Max and Julianne) headed up to Healdsburg around 2:30, had a smooth drive in the Grand Prix (maybe our last weekend with the WideTrack).  Our first stop was in Santa Rosa to check into our  urlLink hotel  for the evening.  Hey, don't be too harsh in judging the Motel 6, it was cheap.  While we were putting our things in the room and taking turns in the bathroom I heard a little bell ringing outside, and apparently so did Alex.  Because the next thing I know he's running downstairs while shouting "ice cream man!"  Lo and behold there was a dude on a bike with a cart attached, brilliant!  Lime popsicles and ice cream sandwiches as hard as a rock from being so cold.  mmmmmm.  See what I'm sayin' about the Motel 6, it's got some unexpected charm.  After our ice cream break it was back on the road to  urlLink Healdsburg . We did a little window shopping when we got there, checked out how cheap some of the real estate is up there and then had some  urlLink dinner .  Not a lot of ambiance, but as Max said "when you come into a place like this you know you're in America"  With the classic rock playing and the game on in the background I would have to agree.  The beer was quite tasty, but the jalapeno poppers could be a lot spicier.  As you can tell I'm not a food critic, just a lover of all things fried. The concert was at a church not too far from where we ate.  We got there in enough time to see the preshow discussion and learn a little about the pieces we would be hearing.  Johnny, as always, was witty and knew how to get a chuckle out of the crowd.  The concert itself was fabulous, and not being a music critic either, I'll just leave it at that.  Watching people perform classical music takes it to a whole different level.  I highly recommend it. After the concert we attended a little reception at  urlLink Seghesio , had some wine, cheese and crackers and got to hang out with Johnny a little bit more.  Then it was back to the Motel 6. We watched a little SNL and then all 4 of us dozed off.  At around 2am, the beginning of the "lost hour" of daylight savings time, I heard a little ruckus coming from the room next door... the one closest to the headboard, of course.  It was a woman, apparently having a  fantastic  time.  And then it stopped.  And then she was having a fantastic time again.  And then it stopped.  And again.  I think I fell asleep between these joyous moments, but there were at least 5 distinct moments of pleasure.  After the 5th one I had to wonder if she was alone, because all I could hear was her moaning, perhaps she was some sort of loner.  She didn't even shout out a name...  Then I was awake, wondering what would happen next.  Finally a dude chimes in, I felt a little better knowing she wasn't alone.  But it concerned me a little, because this was going on for at least an hour.  An hour or more.  Could it go on much longer, I hope not.  Anyways, once he gets a little louder she shouts out "yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes....." until it finally stops.  Now I'm thinking I can finally get to sleep with all this exciting business out of the way.  But I can't, because the minute it's over she starts talking, and talking, and talking.  In Spanish, so I couldn't understand her, which took all the fun right out for me.  She talked for about 45 minutes, I can't imagine about what, and the guy was quiet once more.  I see a recurring theme in their relationship, and I don't even know them.  Alex turned over (he never woke up during this extravaganza) and put his arm around me and I finally got back to sleep.   The next morning Julianne and I asked each other if we heard the late night lovin'.  I didn't realize that she was awake, too.  We could have had a good laugh, but alas, the lost hour was indeed lost. We had breakfast in Healdsburg and then headed to  urlLink Preston Vineyards  for the http://www.prestonvineyards.com/site/jug-wine.html of wine you can only get on Sundays.  Tasted a little wine and then drove over to  urlLink Cline .  Max is a member so he picked up his wine while Julianne, Alex and I looked for turtles in their pond.  Then it was home again. A nice weekend, although hot and I could have used a little more sleep.  So mystery couple of Motel 6... kudos to you for making the most of your lost hour, because turning those clocks back only happens once a year.

      The thieves knew what they wanted, I like to picture them with a list in hand, something written neatly in cursive on a "from the desk of..." notepad:   Things to get from old Saturn today ~ catalytic converter, pipe, muffler, rear bumper, interior center panel, various and random parts of air filter, battery cover, air filter cover, manual, pennies covered in spilled soda, map of San Francisco and an anti theft club.  And there you have it, they were able to cross everything off their list.  Does it exceed the value of the car?  But of course! But that's okay, this body shop knows us now and they know what cheap skates we are.  Used parts? Bring em on!  Hey, here's a little something from the pick and pull down the street, we could use that.  And thus a car is reborn. I have to admit the manual missing hurt my heart a little, because it had Geraldine Ethel's actual signature, but I think I'll be okay.  So things are looking up, it seems as though we'll have the car back soon,  and  the cable guy actually came on Saturday... and he  rocked my world  by doing a little something he called "my special trick".  My special trick allows me to now watch crap like Trading Spaces, I Love the 80's and Queer Eye (which I've never seen before) for the same low price of cheap-ass cable.  I'm starting to wonder if it's true that for everything the Universe takes from me (I know, I'm dealing with material objects here, but allow me to be shallow this week, it feels good) I get something kind of cool back.  Now I'm just waiting for that dream job...

      Last night Alex and I had a blast!  First we had a little visit to the Emeryville police station and then took an exciting trip down memory lane by stopping off at the Richmond police station.  That's right, they found Geraldine, the wayward Saturn.  She's impounded right now, and will remain so until Monday when the insurance company will set her free.  We don't know what she looks like yet and the police report doesn't give away too much information, but she seems to be okay.  The only part that worries me a little is the section of paperwork for tire condition says "fair" and the section for hubcaps says "none".  Whether that means Saturn hubcaps are insignificant enough to not even count as hubcabs or that the hubcaps are actually missing I'm not sure.  And the "fair" tires could go either way.  I mean, who really looks at tires?  Sure they were new, but I didn't say we paid a lot for them.   Found in Richmond, just like last time, I'm starting to wonder if, in fact, the car is not being stolen, but instead running away.  Perhaps it longs to be in Richmond.  Maybe she has some friends there that she can't be away from.  Maybe I'll start driving over there a few times a week so the car won't feel the need to stray there on her own... at inconvenient times. I would bet money that the club I should have used to protect the car from the theft will be missing, so I'll buy another one once I get the car back.  This will make number 3.  Is that enough to learn my lesson?  I'll let you know.

      Last night I got home (after a smooth ride in the Grand Prix) to find that I had no cable.  This happens about 2 times a week, and it's annoying, but when you only pay 13 bucks a month what can you expect?  So I get the cable company on the horn and I'm on hold for about 45 minutes.  I use the speaker phone feature and while listening to hold music make myself a nice bowl of pasta, special spicy marinara sauce by Alex, melt a little goat cheese on top.  I'm just about done with my meal when a (and I use the term loosely) customer service representive comes on the line.  Barely able to understand what she's saying, because speaking clearly doesn't seem to be a priorty for her, I try to explain that I have cable on one tv, but not on the other, and this has happened before, blah, blah, blah.  She goes through the obligatory "is your tv on channel 3?  do you have a cable box?  turn your vcr on, now turn it off, anything now?"  this process takes about 20 minutes with all my "I'm sorry, could you repeat that?" interruptions, now bringing my time on the phone with ComCast just over an hour.  Finally I tell her that I know how to work my cable, but my cable isn't working, so it's her turn to tell me what she can do.  She tells me she can have a service tech out to see me on Thursday between 9 and 4.  Will that work?  ummmmm, lemme think. nah, I should probably go to work.  "well, you see, maam, the service techs work in a cycle of 5 days, so if you don't take this appointment tomorrow you'll have to wait 5 days."  Now I'm starting to feel the blood pressure rise.  Silence.  I finally tell her that I'll wait 5 days.  Silence.  "hello?"  Silence.  "helloooo?"  ahhh, there she is, trying to find a time on the computer.  Okay, she can have someone out to see me on October 25, but she can't give me a time, so basically just anytime that day.  hmmmmm. lemme think.... I tell her that I will need to speak to a manager.  Silence.  Continued silence.  I hang up. Then I started thinking about how mad I am about no cable, about the crappy customer service rep, about the car, about my job, about not being able to spend more time with Alex because of school, about missing my family, about the WideTrack.   It was at that point I gave my most dramatic performance since the "chicken dinner fling" of '95 (which landed me in therapy for 2 years).  I needed a release - stupidly, I gave my bowl (with the rest of my dinner inside) a toss.  I know, you're thinking, meh, not so dramatic.  Oh, contraire!  That toss hit the edge of the couch  just right , something about the fork still in there... that bowl burst.  Unknown to me before that time, the bowl was glass.  It burst into thousands of itty-bitty pieces, sending gemelli into the living room closet from under the door.  Sauce somehow made it onto the wall behind me, as high as 9 feet.  Small slivers of the bowl were found in the bathroom down the hall.   I like to think that it wasn't because I threw the bowl that it broke, I like to think that all the anger and frustration that I've been harboring for the past 2 years found it's way into the bowl and the bowl just couldn't take the pressure and it exploded.  You know, like a sci-fi film. I looked away when I heard the shattering sound and walked to the other end of the room.  Alex was pretty close to the scene of the crime.  I turned back to witness the horror that used to be our living room.  "It wasn't supposed to do that." Alex and I chuckled, because it was funny and absurd and disgusting.   I spent the next two hours cleaning the couch and rugs and floors and bookshelves and walls and ceiling.  It felt good.  It was nice to have a problem I could solve.  Sure, I can think of a million other ways that I could have blown off some steam.  At least half of them would be less messy.  But I have no regrets about the bowl.  I think it was just what I needed; a bizarre action followed by a tedious consequence that made me really focus on something that was finally in my control.

      and when i feel blue about my car getting stolen i just think to myself... at least i'm not  urlLink this guy   I'm driving around in a  urlLink Pontiac Grand Prix  now.  It's the most guido thing I've ever been a part of.  I'm not a Pontiac fan and I've always had this joke that Pontiacs are for tacky girls from Florida who wear their clothes too tight.   urlLink This  might prove my theory.  Although Alex has a good time driving it (maybe too good of a time) I would have to pass it up if it were offered to me again.  Not that I'm saying I would rather have a Ford Escort or a Geo Metro, I'm just saying I'm not sure if wider really is better.  I'm a little unnerved by the "WideTrack", which the display eagerly reminds me is the coolest feature of the automobile every time I put the key in.  The WideTrack makes me feel like I might hit the car next to me, the WideTrack makes it nearly impossible to fit in a parking spot, the WideTrack disables me from picking up items dropped on the passengers side while driving.  I was in the zone with the Saturn.  With an hour commute (each way) everyday I've started a little game called "what can I do while I'm driving to distract me from the traffic so when it actually starts moving is when I get mad".  I would do things like reprogram my radio stations, so they were in order, from talk to pop.  Or see if I could actually use my lipliner effectively and look fabulous.  One time I put 6 new numbers in my cell phone.  I wasn't an unsafe driver, just managing my time.  Now due to WideTrack the game is off.  I can't do anything but look at the road and hope I don't hit the jersey barrier.  God forbid I'm flanked by cars, that requires concentration I haven't used since the SATs.  Greg and I carpooled today and I had the challenge of conversation while WideTracking.  I did okay, but there were a few times I got the sweaty palm.   The automatic door locks and window might make up for it in the long run, and seeing that it is fully covered by our insurance I really shouldn't complain.  and did I mention the bonus?  Alex asked me if I wanted to check out the trunk, cause you gotta see how big it is... and he pops it open and there are all these bags.  At first I thought they were surprises for me, but as it turns out it's just stuff left over from the last renter.  Things like sneaker boots with 3 inch spiked heels, a curling iron and a bag full of underwear that smells like smoke.  mmmmmm.  Surprise!  the Saturn was never this exciting.

      it's been awhile, and although I could write about a lot of things that have happened in the past 2 weeks I would much rather whine about my car being stolen.  That's right, it's the second time this year, and to tell you the truth, it feels just about as bad as the first time it was stolen.  Last time it was  urlLink El Cerrito , a parking lot outside of Albertsons.  Please, take my car, I'll be in the store for 22 minutes.  Sure it's only worth 2000 bucks and will completely inconvience me for the next year it takes to save for another car and deal with the insurance company.  But let me tell you, it comes complete with dry cleaning in the trunk and birthday presents in the back seat.  oh, no, no, I insist, you must take the 2 maglights and those earrings, too.  Spare change, it's all yours.   If I could just get the car back with some minimal damage in 4-6 weeks that would be swell.  I learned my lesson after that.  Keep a clean car, and always use the club.  Unless I forget to use the club and go in Barnes and Noble in  urlLink Emeryville  for 45 minutes.  So at least this time along with a car with over 103000 on it all they got was a 9 dollar cellphone charger and a  urlLink FasTrak .  Well, screw you, theify, I cancelled the FasTrak... try to cross that bridge for free now, ya bastard.  The shame of it all is the four brand new tires, so young at only 3 days old, and the new brakes.    I try to put a positive spin on it, like "well, at least they'll be safe when they peel out of the parking lot!" or "I hope they get a good price on those tires like we did!"  but lets face it... I'm pretty pissed off.    The Bay Area has not been kind to me when it comes to cars, or jobs, or living situations.  Sometimes I feel pretty sad about my luck, but I am thankful that Alex and I have friends like Greg who will pick us up at midnight when a police officer (I won't mention any names, but his initials are Dante Diotalevi) didn't offer us poor, helpless victims a ride home.  I'm happy that Alex and I can get a little aggro about how much this sucks one minute and then laugh our asses off when we think about how the security officers in the mall asked me if the car was stolen because of the stereo, or perhaps my custom rims.  I have a feeling that we won't be seeing the car again this time.  Getting it back once was wacky enough, but I think we're pushing our luck now.  So I won't bid a fond farwell to Geraldine Ethel just yet, but I have a feeling in my heart that it's time to let go.  I'll begin my 3 weeks of mourning today; those memories of your stained, low seats, the front right speaker to the factory issue radio that's always been blown, the whining sound you made when I started you up in the morning...  I can't go on, I think I have something in my eye.  please excuse me.

      In my ambition to be more domestically creative I attempted to make a peanut butter chocolate pie Sunday night.  It struck me that I should do this at around 10pm, and since I already had all the ingredients I decided to go for it.  Who needs to get to bed early when you have pie? This pie took me about 2 hours to make.  It really shouldn't have taken that long, but the list of wacky things wasted my time included items such as: trying to use a tinfoil cake pan instead of a pie pan, beating heavy cream by hand instead of using the electric mixer, and making crumbs from graham crackers in the blender.  I like to call it ghetto cooking, where I follow the directions to a point, but then I kind of do things my own way, which I always think is the quick and dirty way to do it, but it actually takes me longer and inevitably makes whatever I'm making look kind of crappy.  I haven't tasted the pie yet, but Alex and many of my co-workers have and assure me that it is delicious.  Although I haven't eaten an actual piece I probably ingested about 3000 calories of raw ingredients while I was making it.  The contents of the pie go a little something like this - some graham crackers, lots of butter, tons of sugar, peanut butter, cream cheese, chocolate and an obscene amount of heavy whipping cream.  Watch everyone get sick from it tonight and come and kick my ass tomorrow.  Oh well.  I have to make 2 more tonight for Thanksgiving.  That will make it virtually impossible for me to ever eat a slice because I'll be thoroughly disgusted by the idea of this pie by around 9:00 tonight.  Weight loss by cooking... look out Dr. Phil, I may have a new plan.

      I've been struggling with insomnia lately, and sadly I turn to my fine friend - TV (accompanied by cheap cable) for comfort.  Unfortunately the only things I can find on TV right now are Michael Jackson and Britney Spears.  Disappointing, to say the least.  Entertaining?  Hardly.  I was amused with Britney for a while, but now it's just sad.  I begrudgingly admit that I watched the Diane Sawyer interview.  It was terrible.  Diane asked "This has been a hard year for you, hasn't it?"   Britney responded with a yeah and a lip tremble, which turned into "ewwww" (for the 10th million time in the interview) and began to cry.  She then asked them to shut the cameras off because it embarrassed her.  Could it have embarrassed her more than the  urlLink wig  she wore to kick off the football season?  that thing was bad.  I've decided to not watch anymore crap about Britney, if I can help it, but I did read this hi-larious  urlLink review  in yesterday's paper.  While not being able to sleep I've acquainted myself with some music videos, since MTV and VH1 actually  do  play videos... between 2 and 4 am.  Right now I'm digging on  urlLink Beyonce's   Baby Boy .  Especially because that little modern dance break down in the middle of the song where she throws a bunch of sand down her bikini top.  I can't say I understand why she did it, but it makes me laugh every time. I also took a little time to get to know the  urlLink Clay Aiken  video. I watched it twice, I think that should do it.  It's one of those videos where he has a stage in the middle of LA, and as he sings his totally awesome song people gather all around his stage...  to enjoy his way cool image.  My favorite part is the heavy metal looking dude kind of watching Clay, and then kind of looking away, like he knows he shouldn't be watching Clay.  I think we can all relate to that, especially once you have watched the video (and admitted it to everyone).

      Things finally feel like they are starting to turn around for me.  We got the car back.  I have the possibility of a pretty kick ass job lined up.  Zach the cat is cuter than ever.  I started a tap class on Monday.  I fit into most of my pants.  Life is pretty good. I've been in a great mood this week (despite some bouts with insomnia) and even though I constantly find a stream of ants coming out of some random places in my kitchen I don't want to run away screaming.  Zach woke us up at 3am to let us know that his bowl was pulsing with ants on Wednesday morning.  I must say that he is one smart cat, he really knows how to send a message out when he wants me out of bed, I got the full treatment - everything from forehead licking to a meaningful dance on the ribs.  However, I started to wonder how smart he really was when I finally got up to see what he wanted and he runs to his food bowl and sticks his giant noggin in there and starts chowing down on food covered with ants.  If it didn't bother him enough to get him to stop eating it then why did he get me up?  Maybe he was making a statement "I'll eat this if I have to, see what you put me through?"  Or maybe he's been watching too much  urlLink Fear Factor  and wanted to show me he's game for a reality TV show.  At any rate it helped us to stop the ants before they got to the people food, so thanks Zach, for a job well done!   While driving home on Tuesday I found a new (crappy)  urlLink radio station , that was playing holiday music.  Apparently they started this at the beginning of November and will continue through the holidays.  I thought to myself - what kind of psycho would listen to this now?  it's not even December yet.  As I pulled into my parking spot after an hour drive home the answer to my question was pretty clear.  I am the psycho.  I guess there is something comforting about Christmas music for me, kind of like a big plate of macaroni and cheese or mashed potatoes.  It means that I'll most likely be getting some gifts soon, and who doesn't like that?  I'll probably get some Christmas cards from friends I haven't heard from in a while.  But I think above all I like holiday music because I know all the words and I can sing along.  Nothing makes time fly on an hour commute like crooning with Bing Crosby and Dean Martin.  I know this isn't for everyone, but if you're feeling kind of down, especially at work, you might want to give some thought to a little holiday tune.  And if it doesn't work for you perhaps you can take pleasure in knowing that you have annoyed others in your immediate vicinity....

      Writing about cars.  Never thought it would come to that.  But I think I'm past it now, it's all over.  I got the Saturn back and it's driving better than ever.  Back to the same old low ridin', teal, stained seat form of transportation and happy to be there.  Alex replaced all the inside panels with a successful trip to two different Pick and Pulls, he even found them in the same color.  He also bought a new club (number 3) and I use it EVERY TIME.  People at work make fun of me, but that's okay, because I bet they haven't had their car stolen, twice.  I'll take the good natured ribbing to be able to have the chance to run my own piece of crap into the ground. This weekend Alex and I, along with RM and Greg went to  urlLink Spike & Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation .  Not really as good as the last time I went, which was probably about 7 or 8 years ago.  A lot of low brow stuff repeated over and over and I couldn't really understand why everyone was laughing.  Lest you think I am trying to be all high falootin', please understand that I appreciate potty humor as much as the next guy, but I have to draw the line somewhere.  At least we went to the  urlLink Parkway  to see it so we had pizza, nachos and beer to amuse us when the cartoons were lame.  RM actually fell asleep for the last 15 or 20 minutes and was not too sad about catching a little shut eye.  We also had a drink before the movie at Baggy's By the Lake, which is now Alex's favorite bar.  Julianne showed it to me when we saw the less than stellar My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  So it seems to me that the formula is: bad movie at Parkway + drink at Baggy's= okay evening, because at least we had a drink at Baggy's.   The rest of the weekend was pretty much about a fuzzy blue and gray scarf that I'm working on.  I put some really crappy TV and bad Netflix movies on and made a dent in the couch while knitting away.  There's something very rewarding about making stuff.  It's neat that you can teach yourself to knit from a book (and help from Rachel) and then have a product to show for your efforts just weeks later.  Unlike exercise the gratification is almost instant and everyone seems to notice how much progress you've made.  Also, a scarf always fits, no matter how much weight you gain.

      Is it wrong to like being behind the wheel of an SUV?  Is it bad to feel empowered for having a height advantage?  I'm feeling guilty for my new found love of bigger cars.  Perhaps it's only temporary, a crush, puppy love.  I noticed while driving my new rental (a Ford Escape) over the vast San Mateo Bridge that I am now part of a special group.  I like to call it the "we are better than all the cars lower than us. ha ha ha!" group.  I didn't want this car, I didn't ask for this car, but now I'm driving it. We had the Saturn back for one day.  For one day everything was back to normal, but I knew it was too good to be true, especially when I gave the car a little gas on my way to work and it felt like I ran over a giant rock or someone hit me from behind.  I was driving on the 880 and I gave Alex a call (over the scream of the Saturn engine) to tell him I missed the Grand Prix.  Maybe the car understood what I was saying.  Maybe the universe didn't want me to love a white guido-mobile.  Whatever it was, the car started bucking, it felt like it was going to stall at any given moment.  I became an instant basket case.  Anyone who has ever driven with me can vouch for this; I'm a nervous driver to begin with.  White knuckles come with the territory.  An upset stomach while driving through personally unchartered land is par for the course.  The questions started reeling in my head... Where am I going to pull over when I stall out on the bridge?  How many cars will rear end me when I stall out at the toll booth?  You know, typical nervous driver questions, because it's always best to prepare for the worst, or at least make yourself sick about it.  That's the way my family taught me to do things.  It goes a little something like this: you make yourself crazy with worry because then if things turn out okay you feel great.  If things were sort of bad then they could have been worse.  And if things turn out the way you dreaded at least you were prepared.  I'm not saying this is rational behavior, I'm just letting you in on the old family secret of working yourself into an unnecessary frenzy.  I made it to work safely with a dry mouth and nausea.  I decided not to think about the car again until I was going to leave for the night.  5:30 came around and I took a deep breath and got into the drivers seat.  Smooth sailing for the first 2 miles and then the rest of the ride home resembled a rodeo.  I drove in the slow lane, with my hazard lights on as trucks passed me.  Humiliating. I took the Saturn back this morning, and after an extremely uncomfortable 25 minutes of driving around with a mechanic waiting for the bucking thing to happen while he was driving (it mildly happened once and I became that crazy high maintenance lady shrieking "There! There it is! That's it! Did you feel it?!") he told me the car needed a tune up.  I told him that he should fix it because this never happened before the car was stolen.  It went back and forth for awhile, but once the gals in the office chimed in it worked out to my advantage.  They called the rental car people for me and a nice guy named Cornell picked me up from the auto body shop.  He liked to talk and ask questions and said "dang" a lot.  I liked him.  He drove me to the Enterprise and gave me this small SUV.   So now I'm back to where I was a month ago, except this time I have an even bigger car.  And I have to admit that after driving around in a car that practically scrapes the asphalt (yeah, that's right, I'm talking about you Saturn) it's kind of nice to be up there with the elite force.  I know, I'm taking it back tomorrow, so get off my case, okay?

      Because I thought that yesterday was going to be the last day with the Grand Prix (which I think I may have grown to like) I figured I should end it on an ironic note and decided to listen to the Smiths on the way into work.  (see, get it, guido-mobile playing teen angst music. ha ha ha) I also figured that this might be the only chance this car will have to play some fab 80's tunes.  The extra time it took me to find those dusty CDs is what won me my free ticket into the front of the freeway parade on my morning commute: As I'm driving down the 880 a cop suddenly speeds out of nowhere and starts swerving all over the place.  Right in front of me and the other 4 lanes of traffic.  Cars start driving wacky all around me.  People are stopping short, pulling over to the right.  I just keep going; I'm from the school of thought that you look more guilty if you stop whatever you're doing right away, it's best just to just keep on the path your on and ease into whatever it is you're supposed to be doing.  Probably not a good choice in this case, but old habits die hard.  Then my mind gets to racing...  Can a cop pull you over by swerving in front of you?  I've never been pulled over before, is this how it's done?  How fast am I going?  It's this rental car, isn't it? Then I realize that he's trying to slow all the traffic down.  Okay, now I get it.  Easy peasy.  Just keep it slow.  Stay in the zone with the cop, I can do this.  After about 15 minutes of going 20 mph it starts to feel weird to me.  My mind starts racing again... how will I know when to speed up?  is everyone behind me wishing I would go faster?  can I go faster? the cop is all the way to the right now, does that mean I can go?   I'm not really a big fan of driving to begin with and I especially don't like being at the head of a huge line of traffic .  It's a lot of responsibility.  It's a lot of pressure in this particular car, too.   If I were in the Saturn it wouldn't be a problem, when people see someone in a teal '93 piece of crap they think "oh, well, what can you expect, I'll just blow around them".  But in a white Pontiac it's a whole new game.  "we build excitement" is a lot to live up to.  It was time for me to make a bold move.  As Alex once said "hey, I just drive the way the car tells me to." I'll try now, the cop seems to be pulling to the right a little more, the lights are on, but the siren is off ... a little gas and this lane will be fired up again.  Oooo, not so - says the cop as he races in front of me and turns the siren on.  I almost hit him.  Smooooth.  Real smooth.  Another 10 minutes go by.  Still rockin' out with the Smiths.  I start to laugh, because I'm in a fabulous car parade on the 880, cruising through Oakland at 20mph with the Smiths in a white Pontiac.  I try the speed up trick a few more times, almost hit the cop a few more times - now I'm living large.  We do build excitement, baby!  This car wants me to be a rebel, so bring it, I can't let those behind me down. I finally get to a bunch of road flares, apparently there had been some sort of accident earlier in the morning.  The parade is over and the cop is gone.  I still got to work on time and sadly enough it wasn't my last day with the Pontiac.  I'm stuck with that monster for one more weekend.

      and as it turns out our haunted house kicked some serious ass.  A great cast, some crazy masks and a lot of plastic from Home Depot made quite a stir in our little corner of the Village. Keith and I started setting stuff up around 11am.  Of course I took the day off, because if I have the choice between making some cash or scaring some kids it's pretty clear what the better choice is.  We got most of the plastic stapled to the ceiling - we created a little path from the front door all the way through the kitchen and out the back door.  With some orange lights in the living room and some not so great black lights in the kitchen it looked pretty neat in the dark.  RM and Judy came over around 2 and got to the cobwebs, which I thank them gratefully for, because that stuff is a real pain in the ass.  RM and I busted out some Rosco-glo paint and I did the obligatory graveyard with ghosts and trees (classic WT) and RM did some eyes.  It would have been cool if we had some good black lights, but for 1.25 what can you expect? Long story short, there were 11 of us working our wonders at the house of horrors and we all found our comfortable zone just about the time it started winding down.  Next year we'll have it goin' on.   These were the highlights: *Keith looked remarkably like a Latin man in his clear plastic mask *my chicken mask was much funnier than anticipated *two little girls said "we like you, chicken lady" to me *RM liked to mix it up a little and would greet guest with such brilliant phrases as "welcome to New Jersey!" or "Prepare to be mildly frightened" * Alex knew exactly what shirt to pull from his closet as soon as I gave him his mask, the kids referred to him as "devil man" *Judy could scream louder than any of the kids *Loeb is really good at hissing *only two mild injuries; Alex got punched in the face, I got a pitchfork to the eye *the best "customer" was the little football player who fell down in fear and dropped all his candy, then couldn't decide whether to run or pick up his candy Around 9pm we packed it in and had some beer and Chinese food.   All in all I would say that we succeeded in bringing a little of that down home white trash into our haunted house, so mission accomplished.  And unlike the  urlLink Bushies , I really mean it!

      In the grand scale of the cosmos I'm not really sure what this means... but I feel that it's worth mentioning.    Last night my Dad (who passed away in 1996) came to me in a dream.  He wanted to let me know that I should check all items in my house with an expiration date and make sure I throw away anything that had expired.  He pulled out some old make-up and showed me that I shouldn't use it because it "went bad" in May.  He then proceeded to open it, smell it, and throw it away.    I think we can all take a little something away from this.  I tend to think that my Dad must be fairly serious about this, because he also came to me in a dream about a year ago to ask me if I had theft insurance on my car.  Two weeks later my car was stolen.  So heed the warning of this dream if you wish; perhaps it was advice meant only for me, but I figured, what the heck, it's the holiday season and I should share this wealth of knowledge.

      Christmas time is always a little hectic, when I try to finish up those final details at the last minute everything else in my life seems to fall to pieces.  I can't return phone calls, there's a mountain of clothes on the floor near the bed and periodicals just pile up.  Last night I hit a breaking point.  Too much to do and tired, Alex and I decided to go to the McDonald's drive through on our way home.  I try not to eat there, but sometimes I just have to give in.  I think the last time I had McDonald's food was in the summer of 2001, so I can sort of forgive myself.  I also figured that they finally started putting chicken... I mean, white meat..... in the McNuggets, so I figured I would give it a go.  We got to the drive through and realized we had 8 bucks, plenty.  We got a #5 (all new white meat Nuggets), super sized (to share the drink and the fries) and a double cheeseburger.    The following are the things that astounded me as we ordered: A double cheeseburger is a dollar. You can get your meal regular, large  or  super sized.  There are 3 kinds of chicken sandwiches to choose from.    We waited a while and finally got to the window where the guy told us we owed 4 dollars and some change.  Hey, wait, that's too cheap.  What did he think we ordered?  A number 5 and 2 apple pies.  That's when I realized that "super size" kind of sounds like "apple pies".  Alex told him what we were supposed to be having and the guy says "Sorry, we're out of apple pies."  A mediator steps in and starts yelling at window guy accusing him of deleting the order, he takes out a sheet of paper and taps it a lot while telling him "this is what this car was supposed to have", blah, blah, blah.  Mediator man was actually pretty firm with window guy and told him to do a better job and pay more attention.  Window guy apologized to mediator man (but between you and me, it didn't sound very sincere).  Window guy took our money (6 and some change) proceeded to fill the bag and hand it over.    Here's what blew me away when we got our food: the size of a super sized drink.  It's not a cup, it's a bucket.  I can't even begin to imagine drinking that much of anything at one sitting.  I don't even know why they make cups so big.    Then, I believe in an act of defiance, window guy gave us 2 sauces for the McNuggets.  The sign on the window clearly states that you only get 1 sauce with a 6 pc. McNugget.  That's when I knew that window guy was not really sorry for not paying more attention.    When we got home we unpacked the bag and there at the bottom was an apple pie.

      I can't remember when I last went to a Toys R Us (I just hate giving my money to a big crappy toy store like that...), and if I had remembered how visually assaulting it was I probably would have not set foot in one again.  I felt like I was dizzy from the moment the doors closed behind me, but I was on a mission to find the Ocean Wonders Fishbowl and I had come to far to stop now.  The two sets of drums being used by toddlers at the doorway forced me into the store quickly.  To escape the noise I noticed I could either go into the depths of the store or to the exit, which you can only get to by going through the depths of the store and back again.  I didn't see anyone who seemed to be on staff (except the cashiers near the drums), so I was on my own.  I looked up to see if there were signs above the aisles and that's when I realized there really weren't any aisles in this store, it's kind of broken up into sections, and it took me a while to catch on.  I finally figured out the following: the pinker it got I was in a section of toys intended to be used by girls.  If things started to talk to me and ask me to press them I was in the pre-school section.  And if things had wheels and made loud noises I was in the toys intended for boys section.  All I wanted was the fishbowl, there was no fishbowl section.  After walking around in a giant circle for about 20 minutes I found the clothes and bottles and thought "if this stuff is for little bitty babies maybe the little bitty baby toys would be here too" and lo and behold there was an aisle, yes an actual aisle, of Fisher Price toys for kids 6 months to 2 years.  Ahhhh.  And the Fishbowl.  There it is was.  I did have to wait in line by the drums, but once I found what I wanted the drums and the kids banging them didn't seem that bad.  However, the pink section will always remain bad.

      by the way... I got the pie recipe from a cookbook, thinking it was all exclusive and fancy pants.  But much like everything else, you can find it on the internet.   urlLink Here's  the recipe.  Don't look at it if you ate the pie, because you'll never want to eat it again.

      I ended up making three of those chocolate peanut butter pies... they were a hit, and somehow they got renamed "crack pie".  We even took one down to LA with us, and because of Alex's handy work with a cooler, that pie stayed firm and in once piece overnight and through 8 hours of driving down the 5.   We drove halfway down to LA on Wednesday night and stayed in a  urlLink hotel  pretty close to  urlLink Harris Ranch .  Seemed like a good idea in theory, but if you've ever driven between LA and the Bay Area you know how bad that ranch can smell.  If you haven't driven past there just picture miles and miles of cows all bunched up together in a mound of filth, there, now you've got it.  I never knew it was possible for an entire town to smell like that or that town would be able to survive so close to such a huge number of cattle.  We didn't realize we were surrounded by stench until we got into the center of Hanford and tried to find the hotel.  Alex was driving and I was navigating, a disaster indeed.  I got us all over the place except to the hotel.  We agreed that we should switch it up and I would drive while Alex (not directionally challenged, like myself) read the map.  At this point we opened our doors and I had to look around because I thought I was standing right next to a port-a-potty.  It was bad.  Possibly the worst smell I could imagine for such a cute little town.  I figured it was just that street, must be something bad with the sewers... but then we got the hotel.  different street, same smell.  The room kept us pretty safe from the odor, but by morning I was pretty aware that cows outnumbered humans in this county and I was ready to go.  We had a pretty pleasant drive the rest of the way and spent a nice Thanksgiving with Beret, Rob and little Jack.   On Friday we took Jack on his first  urlLink Merry-Go-Round  ride, his expression was a combination of confusion and terror, but never once did he cry.  He's one tough cookie, and that's part of the reason we love him so much.  We also had some fun in the  urlLink playground  (a very cool Universally Accessible Play Environment) there, which I had never been to before.  It was crowded, but I thought it was really cool to see all sorts of families together... except for the parents on the cell phones, that was kind of sad to watch.  Besides taking Jack to the park we relaxed a lot and ate too much.  We headed back up to the Bay Area on Saturday and avoided some of the holiday traffic.  I must admit that since I spend an average of 15 hours a week in the car (since I started working in San Mateo) I was feeling pretty irritated by 6pm on Saturday night.  We made it home safe and sound and are currently suffering from massive head colds.  I'm not sure if we're quite ready for further holiday festivities.  Good thing we have 19 more days to recover.

      Last night I spent some quality time on the couch watching some seriously crappy TV.  I felt somewhat justified in doing so because I went to see legitimate  urlLink theatre  on Wednesday.  I know that there is really no excuse for watching such drivel as  urlLink My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance  and  urlLink Newlyweds , but I'm in for the long haul now and there's no stopping me... so please let my one night of theatre justify an entire week of my (what should be) secret shame.   Here are some of the stupid shows I watch and why I watch them:    My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance :  This show didn't appeal to me too much when I saw the ads, it was finding out that the obnoxious fiance is actually an  urlLink actor  that got me in a tizzy of viewing.  I kind of think that Fox missed the boat on this one by letting us in on the actor secret so soon.  It would have been just as funny if we hadn't found out he was in on the whole joke until halfway through, then they could have re-aired the first few episodes and people would probably watch them again; now feeling smarter than the duped bride-to-be.  Best part: watching Randi (the bride) squirm whenever Steve lets out that crazy yelp of a laugh and stares at her a little too long.  Worst part: the host's eyebrows.  She makes  urlLink Phyllis Diller  look like a make-up genius.  I'm not committed to this show, but I adore a good improv actor.   Most Extreme Elimination Challenge :  Take a wacky  urlLink Japanese game show  and don't translate it to English, just make up your own crap!  Throw in a few fart jokes, references to alcohol and/or drugs and plenty of sexual innuendos and voila!, you've got a show for custom made for SpikeTV.   urlLink MEEC  is so low brow that it appealed to me (and Alex) on a whole new level.  Apparently it's been around for awhile but it wasn't until last night that my desperate channel surfing brought me to it.  If the voiceovers from the  urlLink Iron Chef  ever make you giggle then you're gonna love this.  Here's a  urlLink review  if I've you're wanting more info.  Best part: the voiceovers, it's so well written.  Worst part: I got a little overwhelmed by the scatological humor a few times.  I'm not sure if I'll watch this show again on purpose, but it was a good find while flipping.   Newlyweds : It's just plain amusing.  Whoever edits this show is a genius.  Best part: the pure goofiness of Jessica Simpson.  Worst part: realizing that a 23 year old woman spends more on her husband's birthday than I make in a year.  I'll probably watch the whole season of this show... how can I not, it occupies every other time slot on MTV.    urlLink The Apprentice  :  I think that Mark Burnett is pretty darn smart, I've been thinking it ever since I fell madly in love with  urlLink Survivor .  I thought it was brilliant that he took some of the best elements of Survivor but then gave Donald Trump (and the other producers) the power to keep the people that otherwise would have been voted off by peers.  I was more into this show for the first two episodes, it's losing it's charm as of late.  The women use their sex appeal for each challenge and frankly I find it degrading... but then I have to punch myself in the arm and say "It's freakin' reality TV!  Don't be an idiot."  There are some interesting people on this one and there's nothing more fun than watching people crack under pressure.  I'm really missing this  urlLink geek  who got booted last week.  Best part: Donald Trump's hair.  Worst part: the whorish women.  I'll tune in for next week's episode, but if I see one more belly button from any of those women while they're "working", I'm out.   urlLink  American Idol  : This show is a winner, especially for those with a short attention span. I don't think there's any reason for me to go further into this because let's face it... everyone has seen at least a commercial for this show... you get the jist.  Best part: the desperation of the contestants.  Worst part: I can't keep up with Paula Abdul's hair.  I missed a lot of this season.  How can I keep up when it's on every friggin night?  Once they whittle it down to 10 I'm in.  But once they get the group small enough so every contestant sings two songs it's all about the fast forward button.  There are more, but I'm starting to feel embarrassed.  However, I will proudly add that I am skipping the  urlLink Bachelorette  this season and I've never watched  urlLink Temptation Island .  And of course I can't leave Survivor now, it's the All Star edition, that's a really bad time for me to go cold turkey.  I'm not trying to sell anyone on watching this stuff.  I figure this is my chance to justify and confess for my sad, sad addiction.  I try to believe that if I have an opinion and coherent thoughts about these reality shows then I must still be a smart person....  right?

      I just went into the lunch room here at work to get some gum and the television was on.  It was tuned to Animal Planet but  I didn't look up at it until I heard "sensuous slugs".  There on the screen were two slugs mating.  Not only had I never, ever given any thought to how this activity would happen, I am now forced to think about how inappropriate it was to watch that sort of thing at work.

      Driving, driving, driving.  I feel like ever since I moved to the Bay Area all I do is drive.  I should have felt like that in LA, but I have to honestly say that I think the traffic up here is worse.  Maybe it's worse because I want it to be better.  I admit that having a new car really improves the quality of my time driving, but I still would rather not spend 2 hours a day behind the wheel of a car, no matter what car it is.  We've had the Matrix for a week and it already has over 500 miles on it.  Seeing the odometer reach that point gave me a slight panic attack, which is silly, because we bought the car so we could drive it.  It wasn't until I spoke with my mother on Sunday that I realized where my irrational fear of putting miles on my car came from.  I told her I had already put over 400 miles on the car (you always want to keep the numbers lower when talking to Mom.  don't ask why).  She replied with "Wow, maybe you should start driving the old car again."  At first I felt comforted, relieved that someone understood me, but then after letting it sink in I discovered how stupid I must have sounded telling my buddies at work that I don't want to have too many miles on the car.  We bought a new car to feel safer and enjoy our time on the road, we bought a new car so we could DRIVE IT.  But now my mother was urging me to follow my wacky bliss of keeping new things new and leaving it parked outside the front window to admire every day, maybe take it on some trips to the market... on the weekend.    Instantly I got a picture in my head of:  me turning the chair in the living room to face out the front window, a spectacular view of the parking lot.  There I am, in the comfy chair, sipping my morning coffee and wearing an oversized white terry cloth robe while listening to classical music, just staring at the car.  I am smiling with only one small corner of my mouth, a coy smile that everyone who owns something shiny and new should have.  I finish my coffee, stand up and move closer to the window to gently touch it, as if to say "good morning Matrix", and then get ready for work.  As I'm leaving the apartment I lock the front door and turn around swiftly to look at the slickness that is our new car.  My hair is windblown and sticks to my pristine lipgloss.  I use the key fob to unlock the power doors, a feeling which I have never known before.  I smile as I admire the way the sun hits the unscratched black paint and shines through the moonroof.  Making sure that the new car still looks new I use the fob and lock the car back up.  I walk down the street to my crappy old Saturn and it begins to rain.  I scrape my knuckles on the ground as I get into the teal blue dented car.  I drive to work trying to listen to the tinny radio over the whine of the engine, thinking about how uncomfortable the 10 year old seats are.  I notice the stains on the seat next to me, wondering what the hell they are from.  By the time I get to work I have lower back spasms, my hair is disheveled and my clothes are wrinkled... and have holes in them.  Smoke pours out of the hood.  I stand in the parking lot with tears streaming down my face and mumbling "why? why?" as passerbys stare at me and comment on the weird color of my car.  I can't be that person.  I'm going to face my fears.  I refuse to be timid about putting miles on the Matrix.  As Joanne asked last night while I was driving home (from a kick-ass tap dance class):  "Don't you buy a car to put miles on it?"  It was the most simply stated question and the answer is pretty clear.   So as I hit 540 miles today it didn't feel so bad.    I do however have this other problem that taunts me Monday - Friday, twice a day.  As I'm driving past the  urlLink Oakland Coliseum  there is this giant electronic sign alerting me to the fact that Britney Spears will be performing there ON MY BIRTHDAY.  I think it would be fun.  But maybe it wouldn't.  Would it be?  hence my dilemma.

      The dude who delivers our paper put a Christmas card with a self addressed envelope in our paper about a week before Christmas.  I am ashamed to announce that we never gave him a tip.  I know that it's never to late, so I could still send one, but I think we threw the card and envelope away.  Maybe I should get up at 5:30 and sit outside to wait for him.  At any rate, now I know that it's important to remember to tip because Alex and I used to get the San Francisco Chronicle everyday... even though we only ordered it to come on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.  It turned out to be the kind of thing I decided not to call and complain about, although I did have a few days of remorse when I felt guilty enough that I would try to get Alex to call and let the Chronicle know we were ripping them off.  Of course I didn't do it myself, I just urged Alex to do it, which he didn't.  So we got the paper everyday for almost a year, until right after Christmas.  I think the absence of a tip had something to do with it.  Maybe he was giving it to us for free on purpose, to get a tip. Or maybe it was the lack of a tip made him look at the records a little closer.  Whatever the reason may have been it's just as well that we don't get it everyday, because to be honest, it was an emotional burden for me.  When it first started coming I felt a lot of pressure to read the whole thing every day.  Then I narrowed it down to where I would at least flip through every page to see if anything caught my eye and read at least 3 stories.  I was often late for work.  For awhile we became those creepy people who have a stack of articles "we are going to read".  So instead of  looking  like crazy folk with the leaning tower of periodicals I decided that I would just secretly  act  crazy and have a relationship with the comic page.  It was a way to justify my not reading the whole paper on a daily basis, but still feel as though I was taking advantage of this daily opportunity.  That's when I realized I have an obsessive compulsive disorder.  I had to read  all  the comics.  Even the bad ones.  You know what I'm talking about...  urlLink Hagar the Horrible ,  urlLink Blondie ,  urlLink Dennis the Menace  and worst of all  urlLink Family Circus .  It's shameful to admit it, but I read them all, everyday.  I would start with the worst ones and end with my favorites.  Some days I would try to stop myself and only read the 5 I really like.  I would put the paper in the pile to be recycled but before I could leave for work I would have to pull it out of the pile to read the rest.  And there it was confirmed, every time,  urlLink Beetle Bailey  was still stupid.   urlLink Zippy the Pinhead  was still beyond my comprehension.  For  urlLink Better or for Worse  was predictable, yet I was compelled to see how the story progressed.  Hagar will never change, he'll always be that good for nothing Viking with a cranky wife.  And none of these were ever funny.  Ever.  But heaven forbid I leave anyone behind.   urlLink Get Fuzzy  was always the last one to be read, because it's the best.  If my eyes wandered over Get Fuzzy at the beginning of my obligation to the comics the whole project was a disaster.  If I read the best first what did I have to look forward to?   urlLink Mr. Boffo ?  That cartoon can't even rely on half decent animation. I knew my unhealthy relationship with the comics was supremely ugly when we got back from Christmas vacation and our house sitter had saved all the papers... Alex separated all the comic pages out and put them in chronological order for me.  He was an enabler.  This was no longer fun, not even a hobby.  This was addiction.  One paper was too waterlogged to make it in.  I'll never know if  urlLink Garfield  happened to be funny on that rainy day.  Is that was I was looking for?  Something that was usually extremely un-funny to suddenly make my gut bust with hilarity?  I think there was something about the predictability about the whole thing that was appealing.  Rolling my eyes at the  urlLink Classic Peanuts  was part of my morning routine. But now I can put it all behind me.  except on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.   to give my props... here are my top 5  urlLink Get Fuzzy   urlLink Boondocks   urlLink Rhymes with Orange   urlLink Doonesbury   urlLink Bad Reporter

      I'm not sure what normal people do over a long weekend, but Alex and I fill it up with all sorts of pajama lounging, usually some furniture gets moved around and occasionally some impulse buying takes place on that magical 3rd day.  I've never had buyers remorse about these impulse purchases... until this weekend.  We weren't messing around; we bought a  urlLink car . It's not that we don't need a new car, we actually do need a second car starting this summer.  It's just that we went out to  look  at what was out there.  Maybe do a test drive.  I never had the intention of sitting down and signing legal documents.  Especially because not even 24 hours prior to purchasing this vehicle I assured Alex that there was  no way   we were even looking at the Matrix... it was too bubbly looking and the t-tiny window in the big butt of the car wasn't something I was interested in.  I knew I wanted something hatch back-y or kind of like a wagon, it needed to have a sunroof and be higher off the ground than the Saturn, oh, it also should be under 18,000.  Alex again presented the Matrix, and each time I turned my nose up in disgust, how dare he ask again. Monday morning rolled around and Alex and I were having some eggs and bacon.   As I was chewing on that last tasty morsel of crispness I looked out the window and saw a car, it looked pretty interesting, it was a Matrix.  And when I say interesting I mean within my price range  including  the sunroof.  I asked Alex if it's a Matrix, even though I knew exactly what is was.  I had now officially decided that it's not so bad.  Alex confirmed the greatness of this car.  I don't know if it was the bacon talking, but within the hour we were at a Toyota dealership.   The first dealership wasn't so great, no one was particularly interested in talking to us.  I like the no pressure deal, but I could use a little enthusiasm.  Maybe it was obvious that we weren't planning on buying right away, after all, it was our first day of looking and we spewed that line out at anyone who came in our general vicinity.  Alex had a chat with one employee and asked him how low he could go on the price.  He told us what the dealership had paid for the car and that he couldn't go much lower than what was on the sticker.  And so we moved on to the  urlLink next place .  We spoke with Ed, a nice man who confessed to buying his reading glasses without a prescription.  We told him what we were interested in and then Alex says "the other dealership said that they could give us that car for X".  X was actually the price the last dealership said they  bought  the car for, but I wasn't going to argue.  Alex was either honestly mistaken or he was driving a hard bargain.  Either way, I saw a bargain and we weren't even buying today, so who cares?  Friendly Ed drove us around to some different lots where they store their cars in search of what we were looking for.  At this point I'm wanting to go home and also wanting some lunch, but I'm game so I take the back seat and wonder how long this is going to take.  When we got to the second lot we saw this car, sitting all alone, it was just what we wanted.  I wondered how he did that, because I didn't see anyone else at the lot.  So Alex test drove and I sat up front and played with the stereo.  (Yep, it's nice.  Okay, can we get some lunch now?)  Ed was sitting in the back like a chaperone and scared the crap out of me when he said "so if I could give you the same deal as the other dealer would you buy this today?"  Then Alex scared the crap out of me (and the same time delighted me) by saying maybe.  We drove the car back to the dealership to "talk about numbers".  I called my sister to relieve me from my nervous breakdown and that helped a lot.  She told me about a cordless phone that she's sending my way and reminded me that I could walk away from this whole car thing at anytime.  I needed that.   When we got to the dealership I let Alex do all the talking.  He had nerves of steel and I was hungry.  He asked for the car for 500 less than X.  That didn't work, but a valiant effort was made.  At that point I was ready to bolt, figuring that no bargain was headed our way and it was the perfect excuse to get out of the purchase today.  But then Ed came back and told us that he could give us 0%APR and the car would cost X.  X... the brilliant X.  The next thing I knew I was signing papers with my clammy hands.  My scalp was sweating.  I couldn't believe I was buying a car.  I couldn't believe I didn't eat lunch.  We drove away around 5pm in a slick black Matrix with a sunroof and a 6 CD changer.   Of course I woke up at 3am in a panic.  Reminiscent of the tattoo freak out of '96, I shook Alex awake and asked him to calm me down.  What had we done?  "We bought a car that we deserve to have.  It's going to be okay."   He's right.  Having a new car kicks some serious ass.

      Insomnia is a terrible waste of my time... if I could only find a way to make it work to my advantage, it's not like I can start to vacuum or do a sink full of dished between the hours of 1 and 5am.  I chalked up one lousy hour of sleep last night and spent the whole day feeling like a crumpled up math test.  During the hours I wasn't sleeping I: wrote the entry below, found some cheap airfares, read some other blogs, clipped my toenails, read some articles in the New Yorker, played with my uninterested cat and selfishly tried to have a conversation with Alex who responded with, "the way I picture it is like I'm a little bug flying around your head like this" and then proceeded to use his index finger to draw invisible concentric circles above my forehead.  Then he smiled with satisfaction and gently snuggled in to a comfy pose.  I really have no idea what he was talking about but it was kind of like the time he was drifting in and out of sleep on a hot summer night and said (unprovoked) "I hate oranges.  I hate them.  And their white, webby skin."    You can't make that kind of shit up.  You have to be in that crazy-like state of half sleep; that time when a pillow is the best damn thing you have ever felt and your sheets are so delicious, no matter how dirty they are.  I have insomnia a lot, so it's not very often that I get to experience this most excellent state.  However, on Tuesday night of last week Alex was asking me questions while I was falling asleep and I answered one question with "You know, those women won't just dry your clothes for free."  I remember feeling slightly confused at my own response, but not concerned enough to stop enjoying the fact that my head had now become one with the sweet, sweet down pillow.   So this week when I couldn't sleep I tried to remember my dreamy haze state and force myself back there, then when that didn't work I would fantasize about TiVo and how handy it would be between the hours of 1 and 5am.

      On Wednesday night I went out with Wil; it was back to the scene of the crime... Martuni's.  I knew it was time to face my fears and enter said drinking establishment on a school night.  The plan was to get something to eat  first  and then  split  a drink at the piano bar.  We went to  urlLink Chow  and there was a bit of a wait so we ended up next door at the  urlLink Pilsner  while we waited.  It was about a half hour before our table was ready so before we even had so much as a nibble we had each had a pint of beer.  Feeling counter-productive by the time we got to our table I decided I would order something with mashed potatoes, because surely that would absorb any alcohol.  The whole time we were eating I was trying to decide how to break it to Wil that since I already had a pint of beer there was no way we could go to Martuni's.  I guess it was something about the mashed potatoes combined with that toasty warm blast from the heat lamps that made me rethink my plan, and after a delicious (and thrifty) dinner we walked down to the sign with the big green neon olive.   There I was again.  It actually made me nervous to be in the bar.  Wil found a good table pretty close to the piano and I decided I would use the one and only restroom.  Surprisingly the layout seemed different than I remembered it from over 4 months ago and I started to laugh while I was in there wondering how stupid I looked that night that I drank 2 of those gargantuan drinks.  I got back to the table and Wil ordered 2 glasses of water and a Knob Creek Manhattan.  The bartender, Billy, asked if that was just  one   drink that we wanted.  Wil and I both said yes with absolute certainty.  Then I started this uncomfortable diatribe about how last time we came here it got ugly and blah, blah, blah... Billy said "I know, they warned me when you came in."  Laughs all around.  As he walked away to get our drink I noticed the two women sitting in front of us.  They were swaying with no certain rhythm and shouting with excitement at each other, were they drunk or what?  Please tell me I didn't look that bad the last time I came in here.  As they started swing dancing and knocking chairs down behind me I knew that no matter how bad I thought I was on that ill-fated September night these women made me look like a freakin' super star.  So Wil and I shared our drink with three extra cherries, listened to some mediocre singers and I am proud to announce that I am now free of the Martuni curse.

      It's been awhile... almost a month... since I've written.  It takes me awhile to get into the swing of things after the holidays.  Alex and I went home and spent time with all the people we wish we could spend a lot more time with.  It's always a mixed bag when I go "home" because I'm so happy to see everyone, and then so sad to leave.  Bittersweet.  Of course there was the obligatory cry-fest at the airport, but Alex told me that everything is going to be okay, and I believe him.  Since I've waited so long to write I think it's best for now to do an informational/observational list of our trip:  * Traveling on Christmas day is actually quite pleasant, unless you were counting on Bayporter to get you to the airport. * Bayporter does not operate on Christmas day * Surprising everyone with your mere presence is a great ego booster * My Mom is an excellent secret keeper * Nana looks terribly cute in sneakers * Knitting is more fun when your Mom teaches you how to do stuff * Atkins banana bread is the worst thing you could ever put in your mouth * My nephew has the best dimple and can find the baby Jesus on command. He also does a rockin' dance to the ABC song * Papa Gino's pizza is pretty good * It's so comforting to have the same best friend for 20 years * Alex picks out nice desserts * I can win at least one hand of Texas hold 'em * Dunkin Donuts beats any other coffee.  Don't argue. * Flights are more pleasant when you are a frequent flyer; if you travel as a couple they block out that 3rd seat in your row * Christmas is still my favorite holiday

      I get to wear jeans to work everyday, which I think is pretty rad, but right now my three pairs are in a sad state.  One pair has a ripped belt loop, an unfortunate by-product of me pulling them up with too much gusto.  Another pair ripped at the seams right near the calf, no explanation for that one. And the last pair has a hole in the back pocket from my manly wallet.  After summing all that up and realizing that I look like a big ol' slob I figured it was time to do some shopping.  And since I've been called the official Old Navy whore more than once I gave in; there's nothing like a trip to the ON when cash flow is low.  The problem with Old Navy is the same reason that it's so swell... it's friggin cheap.  Not just inexpensive, but also not the best quality.  Mom always said you get what you pay for, that's why I'm never surprised when that thread I pull on actually makes the hem in the sleeve fall out, or when I realize the side seam actually does make the shirt twist in unflattering ways, and there's not a damn thing I can do about it.  The problem that  always  irks me though is the size of the pants, so inconsistent. My sister had a good point; they cut all the jeans in a stack, so inevitably the top pair will be a much more snug fit than the one in the bottom of the pile of 20.  (Now I'm starting to feel morally obligated to consider the slave labor it probably took to make these pants and I feel a little guilty for shopping there.)   At Old Navy I can be as thin or as fat as I want to be... depending on the luck of the draw... I can fit into jeans that range 4 sizes.  And once I find a pair I like I know it's impossible to buy more than one of the same thing, because the next pair I pick up of the same size probably won't even get over my thighs.  And, yes, I know that this should not even be a consideration, because apparently it is very un-hip to buy in bulk.  If buying two of the same kind of jeans in one purchase is wrong, then I don't want to be right. I recently had an extremely unsuccessful trip to Old Navy, maybe the first time I've left empty handed.  I must have tried on 12 pairs of jeans, none of which fit me.  What was even more annoying than the jeans, however, was this eight year old boy who was clearly not in his element, being ignored by his mother and older sister.  To clarify, the boy was not annoying, the ignoring of the boy is what got to me.  I can't blame the boy, even I get bored in Old Navy, and I have a mission when I get in there.  He just kept popping up wherever I wanted to go.  I tried on a jacket and when I found a mirror to see how it looked, there he was, against the mirror as if the cops were ready to frisk him.  He was looking at himself with one eye right up against the mirror and then began to lick it.  Disturbing.  Apparently I was the only one who noticed this.  I went to grab more jeans that I had no chance of fitting into, and there he was again, thrusting his arms into a stack of denim and imitating a fork lift.  Only I noticed when the pile of jeans ended up on the floor.  He ran.  I was waiting in line for the dressing room, there he was yet again, running in circles with an unopened bag of Cheetos.  Who was he with anyways?  Then the answer was clear...  He was with the woman who couldn't find her daughter, and in her quest thought it appropriate to jam her head over the top of every changing stall to see which one contained her offspring.  I was not amused.  Every time she violated someone's privacy she would cackle and say "oh, yooooou're nooooot her!"  I luckily made it in after she had done her rounds.   I finally got in there and as I wondered why I even bother to try on any of these clothes, I heard the pitter-patter of the wayward eight year old followed by a loud POP.  It was the bag of Cheetos... the time had come, he was hungry.  Unfortunately the luck of the bag was not with him tonight, because right after the pop came a shower of Cheetos, right underneath my dressing room stall door.  I looked down and saw the floor littered with his delicious fried snack.  I felt sad for the little guy, because, gosh darn it, these were his Cheetos, his last chance to chase away the boredom.  What happened next made me realize that there is nothing that can come between an eight year old and his Cheetos.  No sooner had those crispy orange bits landed under my door than a tiny hand began to search for them, feeling his way from Cheeto to Cheeto.  He didn't try to scoop them all up at once, what he did was downright dainty.  First he got the ones closest to him, clearly a little shy about reaching under the stall, using only his thumb and pointer finger.  One at a time, a Cheeto would disappear, immediately followed by some crunching.  He got a little more bold with each morsel, it wasn't long before he almost reached my feet.  It was as if the floor of my stall had become a buffet table.  I first thought that I should grab his hand and say "gotcha! You shouldn't have your hands in other people's stalls. And by the way this floor is filthy, don't eat those" But then I realized that he had probably witnessed his mother feeling free and easy to look into any stall she felt like, so why should he stop?  I also realized I was sans pants at this moment, so that probably wasn't the best time to address the boy.  Then I figured that I might help him out a little and scoot all the tasty bits a little closer to his hands, but that would just make me an enabler.  So instead I just pushed all the Cheetos to the furthest corner of the stall because he really shouldn't eat those things off the floor.  He grabbed as many as he could, and finally gave up.  I heard him root around the almost empty bag for any remaining tidbits. When I exited the stall there he was just sitting there, like a prisoner of Old Navy, defeated, Cheetoless.  As I gave the attendant the mound of clothes that would never fit me, I looked back.  Just as I suspected, he lost no time getting into the deserted stall,  foraging in the corners, desperate to find all the orange stragglers.  His mother and sister down the end of the dressing room, fighting about how tight those pants looked.   See, Old Navy clothes don't really fit anyone.

      I started my day with a healthy sized panic attack so my head would hurt just right for an hour flight and an all day outing at a beach (scouting a location).  It ended pretty well, with a sunburn on my nose and a seat in first class, compliments of my "feeling sorry for me" boss.  Usually work doesn't stress me out this much, but today just pushed me over the edge and I kind of lost it.  Phone calls to my sister and mother, pre-boarding the migraine flight, helped to take the edge off, but on a scale of 1 - 10 I give this day a 2.   I guess not having control over where I want to live or what I want to do for a living have worn me down to an emotional pulp that led to a sob fest in the ladies room at SFO... at 7:23am.  It's been a long time coming and putting on a happy face just didn't fit into my repertoire today, come to think of it, it hasn't fit any time in the past 2 weeks. By the end of the day I gained some sort of control over my private emotional outbursts and I was able to be quite productive.  I never shed a tear or shouted at any of my co-workers, but now I'm left wondering when my next breakdown will be and how I will handle it.  Chances are I'll take it out on Alex, which is the worst because he was really the coolest today.  He gave me rides to and from the airport, when he really should have been studying for a mid-term.  He also got me dinner and understands that I'm going to have to watch crappy reality TV without him tonight and that I'll probably blab about it before he even gets a chance to watch the tapes.   So now I will go and eat my fatty-fatty-fat-fat burger and fries and numb my brain with the wonders of television.  I also got a package from my sister (I get one every month) with lots of fun things, including my tiara that she borrowed.  I think will put my tiara on and pretend I am princess of my couch. There, I feel better already.

      Stress from my job is setting in, the insomnia caused by the stress is catching up with me.  And while I know I'm not supposed to lie in bed thinking about why I can't sleep I lack the energy to actually get up and do stuff.  When it's 3am nothing really seems appealing.  Reading isn't fun and cooking is just out of the question.  Knitting is okay, but then I  have  to turn the TV on.  Before I know it, one crappy Lifetime movie rolls into something equally as mind numbing on the Oxygen network and I can't seem to surrender to the exhaustion within.  So between the hours of 3am and 5am I've resorted to thinking of how I would design my dream home .  I have had some very excellent ideas, most of which I forgot immediately.   Since I've been kind of like a walking zombie for the past week I've done some interesting things during the hours that I am supposed to be "functional":  * used the key fob for my car to open a door in the office, then walked into door, perplexed at why it didn't open. * spilled coffee from travel mug down both sides of my mouth.  while the coffee was running down my face onto my shirt I was thinking "Why won't that stop?", without ever moving the cup. * attempted to spit chewed gum into a wrapper while driving.  Missed.  Then, while still driving, tried to clean gum off seats of new car, only making it worse. * listened to an entire song by Hootie and the Blowfish * got out of the shower, realized I forgot to wash my hair, got back in the shower to wash my hair, then couldn't remember why I was in the shower again. * put wallet in back pocket and then spent the next 25 minutes freaking out about where I could have lost my wallet. * carved a face on my lunch kiwi with a plastic knife and then became attached to it, vowing I would never eat it. * had overwhelming and inexplicable paranoia that every car in the lane to the right of me was about to swerve into my lane. * sang along with a Sugar Ray song. * realized that the pen I was holding in my teeth was the one I picked up in the conference room.  Because of all the things listed above (and you bet there were more) I was deathly afraid of my tap class last night.  If I was as bad as I was last week (as you can read below)  - pre Hootie and the Blowfish episode - what would happen this week?  Then when I walked in and realized I was half the class I almost had an anxiety attack.  As it turns out I do much better in a smaller group and no one had to fear the return of Frankentap (name courtesy of Wil).

      I thought a lot about the whole  urlLink boob  thing yesterday and all the things I wanted to say about it.  But then I realized that everyone thought about it and everything that's going to be said has been said.  So now everyone is over the incident, especially me.  I think I was over the whole thing after we watched it for the 11th time (in slow motion) on TiVo (courtesy of Max and Julianne).  About 4 times of watching the "wardrobe mishap" cleared up how intentional the act was, around time number 6 it had lost it's novelty and shock value and I would say that sometime around # 8 is when depression set in. 11 really pushed the envelope, but we had to be sure.  Of what?  I don't know. Everyone at work had it pictures up on their monitors within 20 minutes of their arrival on Monday morning.  Not me though, I was extremely busy... not only did I have to change my desk calendar but there was a  wall  calendar that needed my attention as well.   Last night I had my worst tap class ever.  I don't know what happened, but there were definitely a few moments where I thought I might have to run out of the room in sheer panic.  The first thing that threw me off was my embarrassing rendition of a stamp within the first 3 minutes of class.  It's pretty obvious what it should be, you just put your foot down ... keeping your ankles loose, let your heel fall first.  easy, like walking.  Easy until the teacher said "think Frankenstien".  Apparently I thought about him a little too much and tried some bad method acting to actually  be  Frankenstien.  Picture this: a bunch of people watching me walk across a dance studio as if brooms were shoved up each of my pant legs.  Add a puzzled look on my face which is slowly turning red.  Is what you picture starting to look like me being a really big ass in front of the rest of the class?  Swell, then you've got the idea.  I stomped across the floor wondering why I felt so stupid, until the teacher laughed while telling me to not forget to bend my knees.  If my memory serves me correctly (and I might be exaggerating a little here) I had my arms straight out like a fucking zombie and my  urlLink eyes  looked like something out of the Thriller video.  And then I shouted "aaaaggghhhhh..... frieeeeend.....frieeeeend!" scaring all the small children in the karate class next door, sending parents into a frenzy with torches to chase me from the village.  My confidence was pretty much shot after that.  He singled us out for some exercises which resulted in me further making an ass of myself.  At one point I just walked over to the corner and said "I'm out".  I think everyone breathed a sigh of relief with my retirement; who wants to dance next to a freakin' monster?

      Alex and I returned from our vacation last week.  I'm still trying to catch up with my daily life. Why it's taking me so long to do that?  I may never know.  I have to admit that a 6 day road trip isn't my ideal get away, but it was inexpensive and it had it's moments.  We made it all the way out to the Grand Canyon, stayed there for a couple days and then headed back.  We thought that we could go home through Yosemite, but snow had the roads closed.  Without using deductive reasoning we decided to head to Tahoe instead, where it was snowing.  I guess we get less bright when we spend 5 or more hours in a car each day.  We zoned out a lot while on the road, but the Matrix kicks the Saturn's ass when it comes to comfort, and if we hadn't bought that new car we probably wouldn't have even taken the trip in the first place.  We started our journey on Saturday the 20th.  No vacation is complete without at least an hour of me freaking out either right before departure or directly afterwards.  This year's freak out was brought to you by the stupidity of me washing my wallet which I had left in a pair of pants.  Before I realized the actual fate of my wallet I thought I had lost it.  Better yet, I jumped to the conclusion someone had picked my pocket the night before and I would never see my wallet again.  Alex tried to help, but there's just no reasoning with me when I'm convinced that I was more than just a victim of my own carelessness.  I had it all pictured in my mind; how some dude just reached into my back pocket without me even noticing.  And now he was buying all sorts of electronics and pricey gas with my credit cards.  At least he didn't get any cash.  But my tap dance card... there were still 2 classes on that thing, I was certain that he had just thrown it out.  I was so mad at that guy for about 40 minutes.  Until I went to remove my clothes from the washer.  Then all my angst was transferred to a poor 8 year old boy who was tired of waiting for a washer and was promptly removing all my clothes from the washer and trying to put them in a dryer.  I say trying because most of my clothes were on the floor.  The filthy, filthy floor in between the washer and the dryer.  It really bugs me when I see my wet skivies on that floor.  I think I might have been a little harsh with the boy, but no one likes muddy undies.  I told him to stop what he was doing, because he was making all my clean laundry dirty again and he would just have to wait until I finished moving  my own  clothes.  And as I reached into the washer there it was... the wallet.  Sitting ever so neatly on a pile of wet clothes.  Credit cards, license and even the tap dance card were all in their correct places.  That's when my fear and anger for imaginary pick-pocketer (and all of society in general) subsided and I started to feel regret about how I had approached the young lad.  I finished loading the dryer and said "okay, all set, it's all yours, sorry I took so long."  What made me feel especially bad was when I looked over to address the boy I noticed that he had retreated to the corner to look at his shoes until I was done with the washer.    I would like to take some time to publicly apologize to the following people:   The boy who would have rather been watching cartoons on Saturday morning instead of getting scolded by crazy wallet-washing woman while trying to do laundry for his family.    My Mom, for calling you just to tell you that I lost my wallet.  For some reason I still think you should be able to fix these sort of things.  Alex, because I yelled at you for not looking hard enough for MY lost wallet.  I know that's not your job, and I have no business yelling at you.  ever.  And last, but not least, the imaginary pick-pocketer.  I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.     more stories of our actual road trip to follow.....

      I've been spending a lot of time thinking about the death of my cat.  Which is pretty pathetic, because he hasn't died yet, nor does he show signs of doing so anytime soon.  For some reason I just wander to an ugly place in my mind about 4 to 5 times a day and think about how sad it will be when my cat  does  actually die.  I know that he can't live forever, and he's getting kind of old, so I'm just trying to be realistic about it, because it will happen...someday.  Sure he's healthy and acting normal, but I have to pick something to worry about on a daily/weekly/monthly basis and this is my new senseless anxiety for the month. I think the main reason I needlessly obsess about this future event is because I never had a pet as a child and I am somehow trying to prepare myself for the mental blow of losing a cat that I've grown so fond of.  Somehow I feel that if I picture in my mind's eye what it's like to come home and find an ailing or dead cat I'll be able to deal with it better.  When deep down inside I know that there is no preparation for dealing with death; it's just one of those things you can't practice for, but that hasn't changed my behavior.    Rational me, I'd like you to meet crazy me, hope you two can live together.    I give it another week and then I'll find something as equally as unintelligent to worry about.  And for the record, I don't want to be a liar.  Technically, I did have pets as a kid... My sister and I had two goldfish that we kept in a giant brandy snifter.  Their names were Tom and Miles (named after friends of our mother, one was heavy and the other thin, just like the  real  Tom and Miles) and they lived a long, and perhaps meaningful, life on the dining room table.  I don't remember exactly how long we had them, but I do remember that we came home from school one day and there was the snifter, still in the middle of the dining room table, but empty.  No water.  Not even a note.  I know that my sister and I each owned one of the fish, and to this day I wonder if only one of them died, but not wanting anyone to feel slighted, my mom flushed both.  I also remember being a complete drama queen about not having the chance to say goodbye and give my fine finned friends a proper burial, even though we lived in an apartment and had no yard. We also had gerbils.   I don't remember too much about them, I don't even remember their names. I do however recall that they had a pretty kick ass habitral (though nothing compared to  urlLink these )and that they ate their babies, or maybe they ate each other, it's a little blurry when it comes to who was eating who.  And they escaped right before we left for Disneyland, raising some questions of if we would find them before we had to be at the airport.  We sometimes would let them run around in the bathtub... lots of fun to watch them try to escape to freedom by attempting to scale the tub walls with those scratchy little claws.  I don't even remember how or when we got rid of them.  Maybe they just fought each other to the death.   During undergrad I went into my "I'm cool and alternative" phase which led to ownership of a pet snake, who I promptly gave away to a grade school when she got big enough to eat rats. And lets not forget the impulse purchase of fish and a 12 gallon tank.  I moved 3 times with that damn tank, those fish just wouldn't give up.  Eventually they all died within 3 days when two new diseased fish were introduced to the pristine tank.    I don't remember being too devastated while saying goodbye to any of the pets listed above.  Except maybe No-Legs-McGraw, who was a cutie little orange fish who I had for about 5 years.  I liked him a lot, but he was hard to hug or cuddle with on the couch, I can't say we ever bonded.  When I think of how downhearted I got while flushing my old friend No-Legs I can't help but think how devistating this whole cat death thing is going to be.  So I suppose instead of wasting more of my time writing about how much I'll miss him one day I'll go squish that big-eyed cat and enjoy him while he's around.      if only he would come out from underneath the bed.

      back to the grind of the day to day work.  The big ol' project is over and I can finally sit at my desk without grinding my teeth every time I hear the phone ring or the bing of an email alert.  I actually opened my sunroof on the drive in today and enjoyed the smell as I drove past the bread factory.  Last week was all about four days in San Diego, one starting at 3am.  We only saw the sun on the last day.  Which we didn't much care about anyways because we were all working on about 4 hours of sleep.       for the entire weekend.  Since the past two weeks were so consumed by work I can honestly say I didn't enjoy my birthday as much as I wanted to, but Alex had a small dinner party for me the Friday before my birthday and I had dinner at my  urlLink favorite restaurant  with other friends on my actual birthday.  Even though thoughts of the work project kept gnawing in the back of my head I had a nice time at both events, I got to spend time with almost all my friends and eat some pretty great food.  It was, however, a little frightening when I realized that the older I get the role of food on my birthday becomes more and more prominent and inevitable.  Come to think of it, my coworkers took me out to lunch for my b-day as well, and while there we having lunch we discussed what food I would be partaking of that evening.  I am having trouble buttoning some of my pants this week.    I also had a life changing experience; I received  urlLink TiVo  as a gift.  TV will never be the same for me.  Alex knew exactly what I wanted (because I told him everyday for about a month) and now he is officially an enabler to my addiction.  I could go on and on about my new pal TiVo and all the fun we're having, but I think I can sum it up like this: pair my brazen love for TV with my enthusiasm for efficiency.  Words cannot describe the bliss.  Coaxed by TiVo and it's ability to CHOOSE SHOWS FOR ME I may confront some bad decisions as far as reality TV is concerned, but I somehow feel justified in my zeal because I can skip over commercials.    please don't judge us.  TiVo and I think we can make this thing last.

       urlLink oh no .  now where am I going to get 7oz. of fries?  I've been working on the project from Hell for the past 3 weeks, which turned into the micro-managed project from Hell yesterday.  So when I get home at night I don't really feel like doing anything constructive because I'm spending most of my time in a fetal position in the corner rocking myself back to a calm state.  This project will be over in just 2 more excruciating weeks and I will be able to continue with my life, return phone calls, enjoy a meal, frolic through fields...  I have, however, managed to squeeze some reality TV in there though.  Isn't there always time for that?  And now here's the part where I confess.  Please forgive me.  I watched the first episode of  urlLink Forever Eden .  A reality show without an end.  11 people who I would never want to meet.  11 idiots hanging out on a beach, at a pool, in a private resort... never without a drink on hand.  I should have been tipped off by the bad logo they use of the snake with gigantic fangs twisting around the apple.  Even the theme song that opens the show is terrible.  There is no reason for anyone to watch this show, ever.  If you feel compelled to read about it,  urlLink this  is pretty good.    So to save anyone else the pain of watching this show - Forever Eden is boring, slow, poorly edited and the cast is so dumb that when bad things start a-brewin' someone actually said "...and that's just the tip of the cherry."      yeah.

      I've been suffering from low self esteem, and for any fellow sufferers I'm sure you know how it can take it's toll on everything you do.  From tap dancing to filling out a purchase order I've been second guessing my every move I make and wondering what am I good at, anyways?  I'm sure this condition will turn itself around as quickly and as unexpectedly as it hit, and I'll look in the mirror sometime next week and say "oh, okay, I don't look like a troll".  Or show up in tap class without the idea that everyone had a meeting after the last class regarding what a terrible dancer I am.  But until then I have to rely on outside forces to get me through the day, I have to actively look for the positive things around me to remind me why I get out of bed everyday.  So far today I've depended on: * the fact that I trained my cat to do a trick * my fabulous sunroof * the awesome power of Justin Timberlake's human beat box * the man who opened the door for me today and said "Do drop in, won't you?" * salad  Beyond those things I'm on my own, so hopefully this low self esteem business will blow over soon, because there's only so much salad a girl can eat.

      Let me start by saying:  urlLink The Mystery of Irma Vep  at Berkeley Rep - if you're in the Bay Area, a must see. And I'm not just saying that because I used to work there.    Today I had to wonder what was up with the ladies room at work.  It was like a lounge in there.  Occasionally there's a conversation by the sink, which in my book is acceptable, but loitering in there is not okay.   I drink a lot of water, so I can really rack up the visits, and I have my favorite stall.  Now I don't get bent out of shape when I can't get in there, but it does bug me when over the din of pee and toilet paper unraveling I am forced to listen to women in the stalls on either side of me chatting it up about driving their kids to sporting events.  It's just not right.  I can't explain it, but I somehow felt violated.  Trapped in a stall subjected to minivan discourse.  Perhaps I'm being prudish, but I just don't find a public restroom in the workplace to be the best place to shoot the breeze.  Later in the day I came across two women who seemed to be exchanging recipes right outside the stalls.  I thought that my entrance may have some effect on the location of the conversation, but they remained right outside of the stalls, exchanging items from their purses, giggling and writing things down.  The worst part is the obligatory greeting, and if the conversation is long enough, goodbye wave.  Maybe it wouldn't bother me if I didn't actually know who these people were, but I see them everyday in the lunchroom, the parking lot, the stairwell.  And I know that everyone needs to use the bathroom, so I'm not ashamed... I'm just looking for a peaceful pee.

      Alex just got home from a short trip to Walgreens to pick up some much needed sherbet.  Along with the sherbet he made a purchase of some paper towels... we usually buy our paper towels from Costco, you know the plain white ones that come in a 60 lb. package?  Walgreens paper towels just aren't the same.  First of all the name brand is  urlLink Tuf .  Then you must consider the prints.  There are 3 in this particular pack.  One is light yellow tulips with some pink and blue blobs thrown in for good measure.  The second is a rendering of a light green bow holding some sparse stems accompanied by the words parsley, sage, oregano, tarragon and thyme.  On the last roll you will find pictures of pies which look like upside down baskets next to bright pink apples and cherries.  As if that weren't bad enough it says "home is where the pie is" surrounded by hearts.  Who's idea was this? what's wrong with plain white? and how did we run out of a 4 month supply of paper towels and not notice?

      In May 2000 Alex and were married in Las Vegas, which is what made it an appealing stop off on our road trip.  However, every time I go there I forget how sick I get of that place after about 3 hours.  The Strip is a lot longer than I think it is, every time, and I always wear the wrong shoes.  And the people, so many people.  People who need to stop and look at something, people who can't chew gum and walk at the same time.  I know that's what Vegas is all about, but for some reason I like to picture it differently in my imagination and then feel a sad, sad let down when it's the way it always was.  We stayed at the  urlLink Tropicana  by default.  There was some sort of convention in town and all the nice hotels were all booked up.  We were supposed to be staying in the Garden Room section of the "original" (a.k.a. two floors that look out onto the parking lot) hotel, but the woman at the front desk did a good job of convincing me that the for 10 bucks more we would be better off in one of the towers.  16th floor, here we come.  The room was absolutely hideous.  The bed had a headboard of mirrors that continued up and onto the ceiling.  There was also a wall of mirror on the right side of the bed.  and a giant mirror on the dresser directly across from the bed.  Let us not forget that I was faced with all these reflections of me after the bathing suit debacle.  how unfortunate.  After resting up in the magical mirror room for a bit we walked down the strip to the  urlLink Aladdin .  Alex heard that the dinner buffet was pretty good there and the hotel wasn't complete the last time we were there, so we thought we should check it out.  We strolled down the Strip, smashing into other tourists and refusing cards with numbers of call girls.  By the time we got to the Aladdin I had a big ol' blister on my right foot, all because I wanted to wear cute shoes.  When will I learn; you can't wear cute shoes in Vegas unless you're planning to park yourself at a slot machine all night.  We did have to wait in line for the buffet, about a half hour, not too bad.  The other people in line were entertaining though.  The man behind us in line was with his family of 5 and never uttered a word.  He did, however, amuse himself by feeling up the 4 inch "jewels" which were embedded in the walls of the casino.  I couldn't help but notice how he was fondling them and it was actually kind of creepy.  He did it for awhile, until he noticed that I noticed him doing it.  He then immediately stopped and started tapping and knocking on each jewel as if to indicate how sturdy each one was.  He nodded in my direction and I smiled, in approval of the sturdy jewels.  Alex asked me what was so funny and I said "keep your eyes on the jewels" and then he laughed, so I assumed he noticed, too.  We finally made our way through the line, down an escalator and into another line where we could finally see food and a hostess.  Jewel groper continued to tap, not fondle, all surfaces as he passed them.  Alex and I were pretty quiet during our wait, but we were both chuckling.  As we finally sat down to eat Alex asked me if I was laughing about the man in front of us, so I explain the groper guy, who Alex didn't notice at all, and then I asked what he had been laughing about.  As it turns out when I said keep your eyes on the jewels Alex looked at the dude in front of us who apparently was playing with his crotch the entire time we were in line, while his whole family watched.  I guess jewels would be correct term for that as well.    The buffet was pretty good, the best part was the dessert, but isn't that always the best part?  After dinner we walked down to  urlLink Treasure Island .  Four years ago our extremely klassie wedding package included a video of our wedding, complete with a clip at end of pirates (from the free pirate show in front of the hotel) cheering our union.  We thought it would be fun to watch the pirate show again.  Luckily, a show was starting as we got there.  Sadly, the show has changed.  Treasure Island has changed.  If you go the website you will notice how desperate they are to change their image.  The show was so bad that we actually left half way through.  What used to be a wholesome show with the British navy and a rowdy group of pirates is now a show with a gaggle of Sirens (who clearly worship Christina Aguilera) going up against a bevy of shirtless, oiled pirates who sail in on ship boldly called The Bull.  The Sirens tempt the pirates and the pirates fight back, blah, blah, blah.  The show is complete with horrible songs that sound like sorry rip-offs of Britney Spears' masterpieces and plenty of jokes about blow the man down, it's so wet, your ship is  going down , etc.  Although it was funny to watch, it was crowded and Alex and I were a little disappointed to see our beloved pirates tossed aside for these slutty Sirens, so we walked away.  I'm assuming at the end of the show there's a big dance party and everyone hooks up.   This  urlLink Japanese site  has some pictures (click on the colored text to see more pics) to give you a better idea of the trashiness I can't quite put to words.  I miss the Bucaneer Bay show.  I guess I'm getting old.  sigh.  It was a long walk back to the Tropicana, especially with cute shoe blisters, so we stopped off at the  urlLink Bellagio  to check out the water show and to play nickel slots and video poker for awhile.  We lost 30 bucks and then headed back to our hotel.  I think it might be a long, long time before we visit Vegas again.

      it's been 11 days since I've updated ... alas I leave my blog behind too often.  And I was on such a roll at the beginning of the month.   I don't want to get into details about why I haven't been writing, so I'll sum it up like this: on Monday my doctor and his unsteady disposable scalpel (accompanied by a pack of gauze pads) ended my bout with throbbing pain that ailed me for about 8 days.    So there you have it, with that out of the way, I will continue with my life.  On the Sunday before Easter RM treated me and Alex to our first dim sum. We went to  urlLink Gold Mountain  in Chinatown and I do believe we were the only white people there.  I don't think I would have noticed right away, but the hostess was calling out numbers in Chinese and we were the only people looking around in confusion.  It was pretty obvious to all around us that we hadn't a clue, because everyone who knew the drill (take a number and wait for the hostess to call it) was pushing us aside.  And I'm not just saying that, I was literally pushed aside, a two handed push, one on my shoulder and the other on my hip, by a very hungry man who proceeded to get his number and seating before us.  But not to worry because before I was even done quietly complaining about him the hostess called out our number in English (realizing we were the group who didn't understand the number that sounded like "Jose White" in Chinese) and we were on our way to deliciousness.  The food was swell and it's a good thing that all three of us like shrimp because we must have been there at the peak shrimp hour. I think we grabbed at least 5 shrimp dishes.  It was hard to say, because we couldn't really understand what any of the people were shouting while pushing those carts around.  We all agreed that the best item we consumed was the shrimp stuffed shrimp.  Now before you think about how great that is let me add this,  it was deep fried .  That was the beauty of the whole thing; you have that crunchy shell in the shape of a shrimp, so you have a good idea of what you're about to eat, but you know there's something more... because no shrimp is that big.  And that's the glory (and sometimes defeat) of fried items, what awaits inside that golden nugget.  I don't know who thought to put shrimp within a shrimp, but it was freakin' brilliant.    RM was disappointed with the duck, because it was cold, but I thought it was all good.  Except the black egg.  I could have done without that.

      Problem #3 on our road trip was another oversight on my part.  I forgot my bathing suit.  Even though Alex had reminded me and asked me over 73 times if I had packed it.  It actually became a running joke before we left.  About an hour or two into the trip while watching the road and re-packing my bag in my mind I realized I had not packed my bathing suit.  When I told Alex that I had honestly forgotten it he thought I was joking.  ha ha ha.  The real reason this was a problem is because I hate shopping for bathing suits.  And unless I wanted to forgo the spa at the Grand Canyon I was forced to get a new suit.  I don't know any woman who looks forward to a trip to a department store to scrutinize her cellulite under fluorescent lighting in a cramped space with someone knocking on the door asking if things are "working out in there".  I especially abhor it.  I bought a bathing suit in 1996 that worked just fine until 2000, when the elastic in the shoulder straps gave way.  I ordered the 2000 bathing suit from a catalogue, successfully avoiding the dressing room all together.  The  urlLink 2000 suit  wasn't too bad, as a matter of fact it's quite practical and borderline middle-age-y.  Anything that's advertised as "tug free" and "Kindest Cut" for the upper thigh/ass region is okay with me, although I'm pretty sure those kind of suits are more geared towards ladies who are 40 and over.  Land's End doesn't mess around when it comes to comfort, and I'll take that over fashion any day, especially when it comes to exposing more skin than I think I should.  But, alas, the Land's End comfort suit sat in my dresser drawer for this vacation and Alex and I were forced to stop at a  urlLink mall of outlet stores  in Las Vegas.  For a Sunday it wasn't as crowded as I thought an outlet mall should be, but then again, we were in the desert.  I reluctantly went to a store with only swimsuits straight away to just get the whole thing over with.  But it was just the beginning of a long day of ego squashing.  The women working in the store were quite helpful, perhaps a bit too over zealous.  One of the employees correctly guessed what size pants I wore and then proceeded to point me in the direction of what I was looking for.  I brought 5 suits into the dressing room with me.  None of them fit.  I tried on the first one, couldn't pull it up past my knee.  The next one barely made it over my thighs.  Another one cut off the circulation in my armpits.  All of them confirmed how doughy and pasty I thought I was.  I neatly hung them all back up, thought about weeping, but instead forged on.  I gathered some more suits, some larger suits.  I thought if I went for the tankini I would be okay, you can't go wrong with a tank top and something that looks like granny underwear for the bottom, right?  Once again I got into the dressing room and found myself struggling to get these overpriced pieces of spandex and nylon over my thighs or rib cage.  I hung all the new failures up, this time not so neatly.  Who needs to go in a hot tub, anyways?  I left the all-suit store, gravely disappointing the perky sales staff.  Alex and I made our way to another store and although Alex gave me nothing but words of support I entered the new dressing room with knots in my stomach as I started the whole process again.  No success.  We moved on to the next store, same story.  I finally told Alex that I was done, because at this point I was just wasting valuable vacation time by trying on suits and hurting my self esteem.  I started engraving invitations for my pity party.  We decided to leave the mall and think about a bathing suit later.  Our car was parked closest to the entrance of the Polo store so we decided to cut through.  While passing through I noticed a rack of pretty good looking bathing suits, and Alex encouraged me to try one on.  He picked out the orange one.   Here's some advice for any pale Irish gals out there: never, ever try on an orange bathing suit.  Especially if you are already in a bad mood.   I was in too deep to quit now though, I was going to solve the suit problem... RIGHT NOW.  There was no way I was going to start this process all over again, especially on the Strip in Vegas.  I grabbed 4 different sizes of navy blue suits.  I went into the dressing room and started with the biggest size.  Victory was mine.    As it turns out, when buying a swimsuit simply follow this rule - if you wear a size 6 or 8 in pants then you should just take your pride directly to the dumpster and then grab a size 14 bathing suit.  Because that's the one that's gonna fit you.  I don't know what these fashion people are thinking, but give a girl a break.  We are at our most vulnerable when looking for swimwear, how hard is it to boost a some spirits by just making your numbers a little smaller?  Had I known it was as easy as grabbing something that's double my size I wouldn't have taken so long bruising my thighs and ego trying to fit into merchandise.  We finally made it to the Las Vegas Strip on Sunday afternoon.  We checked in at the  urlLink Tropicana .  And after all the sweat and tears I put into getting that damn bathing suit I couldn't convince Alex to go down to the pool with me.

      I love Survivor.   But I will admit I wasn't too excited about  urlLink Survivor All Stars ... until last night.  I don't know if Mark Burnett rigged the "pick a new buff out of the urn" trick or if he just peed his pants and wept with joy when Amber and Rob (Survivor's first on air couple) got split up onto different teams.  That show got me so damn excited that by the time I watched the Apprentice I felt like I had run a few miles.  Alex was worried about my blood pressure.  Who needs exercise when you're pathetic enough to get an adrenaline rush from reality TV?  Now I'm wondering if Mark Burnett sold his soul to the Devil.  If he did I think it's okay, because Thursdays now rock.  I actually did go out and do something last night, instead of just sitting on the couch pretending I'm friends with reality television participants.  I went out to dinner at  urlLink Nizza La Bella  with my friend Rachel.  I always forget how much fun it is to hang out with other women.  Most of my friends are men.  I should never underestimate the power of chatting it up with another gal.  It's very liberating, there's so much to talk about.  Not to get down on conversation with men, there's just a different vibe.  And something about going out and getting dinner with a girlfriend makes me feel like a grown up.    Thanks, Rachel, for getting me out of my TV rut and making me feel like a full fledged 30-something kind of lady.

      We drove a little more than halfway to Vegas on Saturday and spent the first night camping at  urlLink Lake Success  near Porterville.  We arrived at the tail end of sunset and it was quite serene there; the sun had made it over the other side of the hills, a few boats were still in the water, a warm breeze... no sweater necessary.  We started to set up our camp.  Alex had the brilliant idea of bringing the  urlLink Aerobed  with us (because the Matrix has a 115 volt outlet) so after we set up the tent we pulled the car over, put the Aerobed in the tent, plugged it in to the Matrix and voila!  Now were officially un-campers posing as campers.  It was extremely comfortable and I don't ever want to camp without it, I guess I'm less outdoorsy than I've led on.  (we were in a tent and did use sleeping bags on the Aerobed, doesn't that count for something?)  We started a fire and were about to cook some hot dogs and that's when problem #2 arose (problem #1 being my temporarily lost, but actually washed wallet).   I was looking for the skewers and other camping gear and couldn't seem to find anything except the lantern and the single propane burner.  I asked Alex where everything was and he told me I could find what I was looking for in the green backpack.  What Alex had forgotten while packing the car was that at the end of last camping season we had re-packed all our gear into a handy waterproof Rubbermaid container.  We decided to leave the green backpack for all things propane.  I asked Alex where I could find the blue plastic container and he said "doh".  Thus came the discovery that we were at a disadvantage, especially if we chose to do further camping on the trip.  But we did have a cooler, a lantern, a tent, sleeping bags (and an Aerobed) and that was enough for now.  So we used a Swiss Army knife to cook our hot dogs.  We sat at the fire, split a Guinness and had a lot of fun melting some Oreos to see what would happen.  They glow kind of purple if you leave them on the fire long enough.  We also enjoyed watching the family across the road from us, there was a pre-teen girl who was working on some sort of pop and lock routine to a Britney Spears song which she mumbled under her breath.    As we watched the fire die down the serene lake setting came to a screeching halt.  The campsite of hard core spring breakers who positioned themselves behind us began to blare bad music and crack open a bunch of cheap beer around 9:00pm.  That continued until about 11:00, or longer, I'm not sure, because miraculously I was able to sleep.  I woke up a few times around 2:00 or 3:00 due to the yelping of a young woman, but all in all it was pretty comfortable and warm there.    Alex and I woke up around 5:00am on Sunday and decided to pack up and hit the road.  This was good for two reasons: 1. we now didn't have to pay for the campsite and 2. the motorboats started squealing around the lake at this time.   Off we went, stopping at a Denny's at around 7:00 for breakfast, finding ourselves under-dressed compared to the pre and post church crowds we encountered.  Our waitress had gastric bypass surgery about a year ago.  I know this because she openly discussed it with the perfumed woman sitting in the booth behind us.  Perfume lady was only having a vanilla latte, while her husband and child ate eggs, sausage, bacon and toast.  I felt sad for her.  That Denny's had the best french toast.

      Alex and I had a little shin-dig for RM Friday night, since he's leaving tomorrow for an internship in a land far, far away for the summer.  We ate some grilly kind of foods and played some games.  RM and I rocked out on  urlLink Time's Up .  Then the dreaded  urlLink Wise or Otherwise  got pulled out.  This game gives me anxiety because I have a terrible time reading the answers with a straight face.  Sometimes I laugh so hard I can't even get the words out; I slow the game down with a series of unintelligible,"gheeeeeeeeeegheeeeeeeee"s followed by an "I can't even reeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaad it!" with my red face and pieces of paper crumpled in my hand.  If you've never played before, the idea of the game is a lot like Balderdash.  You draw a card which gives you the first half of an obscure proverb and the correct answer is on the other side of the card. The other players write down what they think sounds like a convincing answer.  Everyone votes on what they think is the correct answer... hilarity ensues.  I lost it again Friday night.  And I like to blame it on Alex.    It was my turn to read, and the proverb was an old Yiddish saying: Life is a big...  The correct answer was "headache on a noisy street".  I got through the rest of the other player's answers ("mystery", "mountain to climb", etc.) just fine, but then came Alex's which read: "Life is a big... beard, unpleasant when dirty and itchy, beeatch."  I knew I wouldn't make it through.  It's a good thing he added the beeatch at the end because I think without that it stood a chance for some votes, but there was no way I would have read it with a straight face, therefore making it impossible for anyone to think it was the correct answer.  (And I  have  ruined the game for people like that before.)  Everyone put up with my private giggle fest most politely, probably because I was the host. But I know it's not nice, so I'm sorry.  Jay had some good ones in there too, like "Everything has two... except Lance Armstrong"  and "Every door has... knockers, and let me tell you junior, those are some nice knockers" And let's not forget Greg's, "If thy camel should break down... hump it"  And we all know that this is not the point of the game, but who can resist when you have a captive audience?  The last one of the evening got the most laughs; There's an old Hawaiian saying "Eat 'till..."  with a real answer of "the lips protrude". Alex's version: "Eat 'till...5:00 for free, after that it's 2 for 1.  And try the poi!"

      I hardly ever write about my job here because there are so many tragic stories of people being fired for such things... and I like my job too much to take that chance. But this is so pleasant, how can I not write about it?  Yesterday my boss took me and three of my co-workers to see  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow .  This wasn't related to our work in anyway, it was just a nice little thank you for going to the convention two weeks ago.  (And I guess because it's Memorial Day weekend and no one really wants to work that whole Friday.)  Apparently he does this for our department every once in a while, and I for one, think that it's swell.     As if my job weren't cool enough to begin with, now it looks as though I get to see free movies on holiday weekends.  Did I mention the bucket of popcorn he got for us, too?  Rock on, boss.  I think what I enjoyed best yesterday was the fact that I secretly wanted to see that movie, but thought that it would be too embarrassing to mention it to anyone.  So I figured I would wait until the DVD came out, or it came to the  urlLink Parkway .  But instead, there I was on opening day.  Laughing my ass off at a movie that was so bad it was good.  But now I must confess that I also saw  urlLink Troy .  Unfortunately with my own money.  It was not good.  It was very bad.  Alex and I weren't the only ones laughing out loud at inappropriate moments.  Here's an example of some of the brilliant dialogue: "I can hunt rabbit and deer.  I can feed us."  Yes, there you have it, cinema at it's best.  Wait a minute, did you hear that?  I think it's Homer crying.

      4 years ago today Alex and I were married.  In Las Vegas, at Treasure Island (without the  urlLink slutty new image ).  Our friends and family came from as far as Boston to share in our 7 minute ceremony followed by a reception of mediocre hors d'oeuvres and lounge music.  I have to admit that it was not the wedding I had always dreamed of, but if I had to do it all again I wouldn't change too much.  (I'm not going to lie and say I wouldn't have changed a thing.)  I do remember feeling like I needed to giggle during the entire ceremony.  I turned to hand my flowers to my sister, who had tears in her eyes, and I felt like I was doing something wrong.  Were you supposed to laugh at your own wedding?  I mean, I did cry for a pretty good portion of the day prior to the evening wedding, so naturally I assumed that I would be a mess while trying to recite the vows.  But there was something about the whole event that put a crazy smile on my face.  Maybe it was the fact that the wedding coordinator wouldn't let Alex put his hands anywhere but by his side, an unnatural pose for anyone, but especially Alex.  Maybe it was because he was lobster-red-sunburnt from walking up and down the strip all day without sunscreen.  Perhaps it was the look of panic on his face (which he later confessed was because he didn't recognize my sister and thought a strange bride was walking towards him).  Whatever it was I was happy and honored to have Alex by my side.  We smiled at each other and I knew that everything was okay, if I laughed, cried or kept that creepy smile on my face for the whole ceremony.  Over the past four years Alex and I have had our ups and downs.  And when you're a drama queen like me, the downs get pretty bad.  But when I wake up in the morning and see his eyes half opened and his sleepy smile as he whispers "good morning" I know I wouldn't trade our love for anything in the whole world.

      The worst thing about being sick is not remembering what it's like to be well.   That sad, sad feeling of knowing that today could possibly be a great day, hell, even an okay day, but because of my inability to breathe through my nose or swallow anything that is not a liquid, it's a crappy day.  And will continue to be one.    With my mood in the gutter and aching joints I sat my desk all day and thought about how nice it was outside and how I should take a walk.  I even ate lunch at my desk.  That's how pathetic I was today. Then Greg and I walked over to the Safeway and bought candy.  That didn't even help.    you know it's bad when candy can't even get me out of the rut.

      I'm not sure what it is about TiVo, but ever since I got it for my birthday I've been watching a lot less TV.  I think this is due to the fact that I know TiVo is watching TV for me.  And when I do get around to watching TV sometimes I'll watch half a show, realize that I'm not interested in it, and ERASE it.  That's right, just like not finishing a meal when you're full, which is a really difficult concept for me to grasp.  Because if it's there you should finish it, right?  Being a pack rat I had a hard time adjusting to TiVo, because I was compelled to watch everything it had saved for me.  All of it.  It got bad, I had about 30 - 40 shows piled up in there.  I got overwhelmed.  I felt like I had a part time job.  Then one day I went crazy and watched the first 5 minutes of Clean Sweep (where they reveal the disgusting, junk filled rooms) and then went all the way to the end to see the finished product.  Instant gratification.  At first I felt like I was cheating, but after I did it for 3 more episodes I figured out that's what TiVo is all about, giving the viewer complete control.  I felt powerful.  So now I pick 2 days a week to watch TV and that's plenty for me.  And get this, I work out while I watch TV.  Now we're talking about efficiency.

      Last night Alex and I took the Matrix into the city with a backseat full of passengers.  RM, Greg and Britt accompanied us to see  urlLink Shaolin Soccer  in San Francisco.  I still don't know my way around the city, and let's face it, I never will.  I'm directionally challenged and if a backseat driver wants to tell me what to do, my heart fills with glee.  Britt and RM directed us there and RM gave us a good idea of where to park and so we did.  Along the street we chose with plenty of parking there were signs with fluorescent pink paint posted on the meters telling us not to park there from 6 - 10.  It was 5:00 at this point, and we all agreed that since  urlLink Bay to Breakers  had already finished we were good to go.  We walked to the movie theatre and passed plenty of parking spaces without bright pink signs.  We saw the movie and laughed a lot.  The kid behind me liked to lean forward and he breathed in my hair a lot.  He also felt sad when he didn't understand why the rest of the audience was laughing and he wasn't, so eventually he also laughed a lot... when no one else was.  We ate a lot of popcorn.    Then we walked back to the car.  Or shall I say, the spot where the car once was.  My heart sank, having had my car stolen twice, I have a general fear of returning and not having the car happily waiting for me.  Luckily because I am so skilled in not having my car where I left it I didn't panic.  As it turns out if we had all looked very closely at the signs that could blind us with pinkness we would have noticed the PM next to the 6 -10.  Alex and I simultaneously dialed the tow number listed below the words warning us to not park there in the first place.  RM walked home and Britt and Greg led us (via bus) to the place where our car was patiently waiting for us.  Greg and Britt also generously donated money to help us get our car out of jail.  171 bucks later we were back on our way to the East Bay.    expensive lesson learned... always read the signs carefully.  especially when they are bright pink.

      Here I sit in the Hollywood  urlLink Renaissance  Hotel with a cup of Wolfgang Puck signature coffee (brewed right here in my room) hoping that's the cure for this killer headache.  I'm here for  urlLink E3 , a convention I would never go to if it weren't for my job.    I probably would never go to any convention if it weren't for my job, because there's nothing I abhor more than trying to wedge my way through a giant crowd of people who all want to look at the same thing.  And these people are so interested in what is being displayed that they forget there are other people in the convention center, never mind their immediate personal space.  The biggest human traffic jam I hit today was the one in front of the booth with the women with the biggest chests and shortest skirts.  The best part about these women is that their job was to look good.  That's it.    "hey, what do you do for a living?"   "I look good!"   urlLink awesome .   One of these women might have been severely dehydrated due to the amount of posing she was doing.  She was working it.  I might say that she violently displayed her cleavage.  Some men were afraid to have their picture taken with her.  It was fascinating, yet annoying, because I was working and I had places to go.   I was also kind of cranky because I hadn't gotten a lot of sleep last night due to the loudest cell phone talker in the room next to me.  With a thin adjoining door between us I could hear him open a hard candy.  I thought the hard candy wrappers were annoying until I heard his cell phone play the Nokia song followed by a rousing HELLO for everyone in the hall to hear.  He shouted many things that evening until 1:45am, unfortunately it was all Japanese, so I couldn't even get any dish.  Only 2 more days of convention... 2 more days of smashing my limbs into strangers.

      Last Saturday Alex and I participated in the annual University Village yard sale.  We got a flyer in our mailbox last Tuesday telling us that we could just show up on the big lawn at the Village entrance and sell our stuff.  As luck would have it not only did we have lots of stuff to sell, but we were free that day.    About a month ago Alex and I had actually gone through a lot of our old boxes of junk and put a box together of things we wanted to sell... figuring we would sell it with our furniture when we move out of the Village next year.  But that box was just the tip of the iceberg.  Upon receiving the flyer I transformed into a madwoman stumbling from room to room finding everything which could earn the title "clutter".  I opened cabinets, I searched the bottom of closets, I contemplated letting some of the furniture go, you know, like the couch.  I even broke a few things in my frenzied search, which I didn't mind too much, because then I was able to throw those broken things away. An even quicker (but not as lucrative) way to get rid of the junk.  I calmed down after I broke a glass and had to confess to a chuckling Alex all about my reign of terror over the clutter.  By the end of the week I had a nice pile going and I was ready to SELL.  The night before the yard sale I made a desperate attempt to find anything else to get rid of.  I heard a lot of "we're going to sell  that ?", and the answer was always yes.  There was no turning back.  On Saturday morning at 8:00am we thought about carrying our things less than a mile to the location of righteous selling but after packing 2 bags and 3 boxes we ended up loading the car.  The seats had to be pushed down, the entire hatchback was full.  We were ready to roll with a trusty change box and wad of ones.  Before we were even halfway through with unloading the car people started asking us how much certain items were.  Most interest in the very early morning went to a portable CD radio and CD walkman.  As I was taking the last few items out of the car Alex was taking our first 10 bucks.  An awesome sight to behold.    We had a lot of questions to answer for the first hour because Alex and I didn't think ahead of time to actually get stickers so we started pricing everything up with sharpie marked sticky notes, which conveniently blew off in the morning breeze.  I had to run back home and get tape.  I am not a good runner.  We ended up making around $200, which is more than I expected, considering our highest priced item was 15$.  That was a telescope, which I had forgotten how to use and Alex had never used.  The weird thing about that telescope is we couldn't sell it for the first few hours because we didn't know how to work it.  But Alex spent a little quality time with it, figured out how to get it working around 10:30am and it was sold at 10:45am.  The power of knowledge is quite useful when selling things.  to sum up my experience here are some things I learned while at my very first yard sale: * I am terrible at practical math * it's probably a good idea to have a price determined before beginning haggling * people will pay for a 7 dollar item with nickels * whenever a kid asks "how many cents is this?" you should just let them have it for as many cents as they have in their hand minus a dime * sunblock... it's not just for the beach * people will ask you to break a hundred dollar bill when purchasing a one dollar item. * price all items at home, and use something with adhesive * don't count your money in the wind

      Today I woke up with a vision of reading the paper while sipping my coffee and eating a nice breakfast.  I even got up early to accomplish this.  However, as I noticed the throbbing black line on the stove all my plans were shattered; I had an  urlLink Argentine ant  problem of epic proportions.    Unfortunately Alex and I had left a dirty pan on the stove overnight, and apparently these ants fucking loooove egg.  It was so bad that I could actually lift a layer of ants with a spatula.  That's how many there were.  Picking up the spatula might not have been the best idea, because as I touched it the ants started to crawl up the spatula and onto me.  not okay.  Of course I did the usual squirm and holler dance while twitching wildly across the kitchen with a spatula in my hand.  Because when the volume of ants is overwhelming I have trouble remembering that they are really only 2 millimeters long.  I finally got my wits about me and got all ant covered items in a sink full of hot water.  Then I realized I would have to put my hand in this sink full of water topped off with floating dead ants to drain it.  Maybe this could wait until Alex gets home?    I walked back to the stove to figure out where they were coming from.  The ants were coming from inside the stove top.  That's right... from within the oven, the thing we cook in.  I grabbed my trusty stick of boric acid chalk and started going to town.  Until I realized that neither my fingers or the chalk were small enough to get to the ant access.  I tried to pull the oven out from it's built in cubby hole.  I ended up with a blood blister, a shirt full of ants and the oven in the same spot.  I was getting very frustrated and wondered why it is that Alex always is at school when these ant invasions happen.  But that was not important, I had to focus my rage, I had to get into the stove.  I got out 3 different screwdrivers, flung open the oven door and examined everything while ants covered in boric acid fell on my head.  It took me awhile, I had to take all the burner knobs off and release a bunch of greasy screws, but I got in.  And there it was... the colony.  The next dumb idea I had (after the spatula) was to not kill the ants straight away, but instead to trap them in a small area between the oven and the countertop.  This bad move resulted in panicking ants fleeing and covering a built in cutting board, a drawer of utensils and a small area of the floor piled up with confused ants in a frenzied circle.  I had done it again, made more work for myself.  I started blotting all the ants up with wet paper towels until I thought about the powerful weapon I like to call Windex.  done and done.  I left the sink full of floating ants for Alex.

      Last night Alex and I watched the  urlLink Summer of Sam , which I thought was terrible.  It was one of Alex's Netflix choices, and it's been sitting around the house since November.  I gave him a lot of grief about it when it was over.  He agreed that it was awful.    Last Tuesday night Sean took me to his usual Tuesday "movie night" as a guest.  I have to admit I was a little nervous going into the whole thing, especially when Sean told me that it's a pretty big group of invitees.  It wasn't that I was scared of any of the people, because I didn't know anyone except Sean, but there were just  so many  people... and if you attend you are encouraged to participate in a discussion about the movie afterwards.  When it comes to expressing my opinion, especially around strangers, I get a little anxious.  Did I mention that Sean is a film/video editor and most of the people who usually go to movie night are linked to the film industry?    Why these sort of things make me nervous is beyond me.  I am smart.  I know how to watch a movie.  I am able to form opinions and sentences.  Sometimes I crack a pretty decent joke.    Maybe some of my fears stem from my childhood, where I learned pretty early that it's probably best to keep your opinion to yourself and privately grumble about what's really on your mind at a later date.  Because putting your abstract ideas out there is a little risky... what if someone       (gasp)        DISAGREES?   **Please note that this rule does not apply if you are backed by a large group who feels the same way you do, then by all means, speak up.  safety in numbers.**  So while watching the movie, which happened to be  urlLink The General ,  I got myself all worked up about what I would say afterwards and hope that it would sound smart enough.  Questions ran through my head like: how can I comment on a classic silent film?  can I get away with sitting silently and saying it's in homage to the silent film?  who am I to comment on this?  I think there might have been a good 20 minutes where I completely zoned out and stopped watching the movie so I could think about what I was going to say.  Then when I realized I wasn't paying attention I started watching the movie more intensely than I have ever watched a movie, to make up for lost time.  I felt crazy by the time the movie ended.  As it turns out I had some pretty decent idea to share with the group, which actually turned out to be pretty small.  And of course, realized that my neurosis was completely uncalled for and irrational.   I'm not going to say that this kind of behavior won't come into play again, because we all know that I have the tendency to get a little antsy in a large group of people.   I'm just hoping that I can walk away from these kind of nights (where everything turned out okay) with a feeling of security instead of feeling like I have to pee my pants.

      I’m not sure if it’s just my luck, or my taste in films, but the movie on the flight home is never as good as the movie on the flight to my vacation location.  So when I was tortured with  Dirty Dancing, Havana Nights  on my way to Boston I figured the curse might be broken and the flight back to San Francisco would have some magical movie in store for me.  But all that awaited me was  urlLink  Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London  .  Sadly, I watched a fair amount of it, because the screen kept taunting me with action scenes, and it was not good.  I will go so far as to say it was indeed very bad.   What proved to be more interesting than the movie was, well, everything.  But a few things in particular made my flight stellar:   *the  entire  row to myself  *channel 7 on American Airlines delighted me with stylings from the  urlLink Beastie Boys ,  urlLink De La Soul ,  urlLink LL Cool J  (So forget oreos, eat cool J cookies, he’s BAAAAD!), and  urlLink MC Lyte  (doin her thing with an '89 swing). Now that's some good music.  I listened to the whole cycle twice.  *I used my laptop to watch some of the most excellent  urlLink Tenacious D DVD .  *and I always request a window seat so I can see stuff like this   urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink

      Reporting live from Cambridge, participating in Jamie's yard sale.  (Free coffee and WiFi!) I'm staying with Lisa and Ben and they brought some of their unwanted goods by, hoping to make some money and gain a little space.  There's nothing like a yard sale to purge your closets and basements with the bonus of perhaps leaving with a little extra cash.    This  urlLink yard sale  is not so much like our  urlLink yard sale ; it seems like all of Cambridge likes to get up late on Sundays.  Today's sale started at 10 and we didn't have our first customer until somewhere around 11.  (In Berkeley we had our first customer at 8:15, as we were unloading the car.) Today we were planning to go until 2, but I think Jamie is debating on a possible extension, because there's a lot of stuff left and someone has to want it eventually, right?  Lisa is at the point where she'll actually take a dollar for anything.  But with the Red Sox game starting pretty soon, I think we might have to have to admit defeat and pack it up.  At any rate we're eating hot dogs, drinking beer, and I get to sit on the front stoop and write this, so at least we're having a good time.  If only someone would come and cart all this crap away for a dollar...  Ben just suggested we set it all on fire.  Jamie surveys the crap  urlLink     Ben and Lisa (pre sale)  urlLink     glassware at sale  urlLink

      Here I am in Boston... Cambridge to be exact.  On Wednesday I took a flight from SFO to Boston.  I take this flight a few times a year and I’m pretty used to sitting in one place for 5 hours, but I still don’t like it.  The first few times I sat on that epic flight were like torture, I remember one time in particular where I put my tray table down and just dropped my head on it and wept softly for about 2 hours.  That might have been the time I was sitting beside the freakishly loud snoring man and in front of the kicking champion of the universe.  The flight on Wednesday was not that bad.  It was actually kind of weird, because the pros and the cons pretty much cancelled each other out.  Here are some examples of the bad and good:  I was sitting in row 13, the only row without a window, but there were only two of us in the row, leaving that bonus middle seat.  The guy sitting in the seat diagonally behind me kept knocking my raised arm rest down onto my elbow, but the 9 year old directly behind me never once kicked my chair.  The 4 year old 3 seats away from me never stopped screaming and whining, but there were three very tiny babies on the flight who never made a peep.  The meal that was served came with a big helping of iceberg lettuce, but the cheese tortellini was actually pretty decent.  My laptop battery ran out of juice while I was watching a DVD of Six Feet Under, however the in flight movie had just started at that same exact time.  The in flight movie was  urlLink  Dirty Dancing Havana Nights  , luckily the TV for my section of the cabin was broken.  I shall now call it the mediocre flight, because just when things started to take a turn for the worst I realized that the potential for "worst" was actually never fulfilled.  But I did get a little bored, so I admit that I craned my neck just ever so slightly I so could watch a little of that horrible in flight movie.  And even though it was one of the most pitiful movies I've ever seen, Patrick Swayze gives quite the performance in there, and that almost made me smile.

      I try very diligently to keep up with pop culture.  I do this because not only do I find it fairly amusing but I also remember sitting in an English class in my junior year of high school and listening to my teacher lament about how she wasn't hip anymore.  Her first mistake was using the word hip.  She wasn't old, but when she said "hip" my brain immediately went in the direction of hip replacement.  She told us that she always thought she would be able to keep up with the current trends and know all the top 40 music, but one day she let it all get away from her and found it too overwhelming to get back in. And that was it, after that she was forever stuck in a world of easy listening and a wardrobe from Talbots. From that day forward I swore that I would never stop listening to current music and I would never wear blazers.  And I've done okay, at least I've stayed away from blazers (but I did have a bout with button down sweaters).  The music, well, I try, I really do.  But sometimes it's so hard to take.  Here it comes, and I never thought I would say this, but a lot of that music sounds like noise to me.    Grandma?  Is that you?  In my attempt to stay afloat in the sea of all things contemporary I listen to iTunes every morning while I get ready.  I actually tune into an unpatriotic Canadian channel called  urlLink Hitzradio .  They play the latest Beyonce, Britney, Black Eyed Peas... etc..  I feel that about an hour a day keeps me up to date.  But that hour is usually all I can take.  There's a handful of pretty decent songs, but then you get throw in some Usher and Mis-Teeq and I'm out.  The first time I heard Usher's  urlLink Yeah!  I was in the other room and I thought I kept hearing a phone ringing, I was going crazy trying to figure out where this phone was. But then I realized it was just part of the song, somewhere in that mix there's a phone ringing.  over and over.  Upon hearing this I discovered how easy it would be to give up the top 40 music, because the sound of that fucking phone annoyed the hell out of me.  Then add Usher "singing":   Up in the club wit my homies, trying to get a lil V-I Keep it down on the low key  You should know how it feels I seen shorty she was checking up on me From the game she was spitting in my ear You would think that she knew me  I decided to cheat  Conversation got heavy!  She had me feeling like she's ready to blow!  Oh! (watch out!!) She's saying "come get me!"  So I got up and followed her to the floor She said "baby let's go"   Upon hearing those lyrics I found myself shaking my head in disbelief while I scuffed across the floor with my fuzzy slippers and pulled a tissue from my housecoat sleeve.  I could go on and on about these songs, but let me just choose a few which make me feel like I should start shopping for some Fixodent.   urlLink Mario Winans  - I Don't Wanna Know This song features P. Diddy and Enya.  I'm not sure if I would have put them together as a winning combination and after having heard it, I'm still not sure.  The part of this song which had me scratchin' my head was when P. Diddy busts into the following lyrics.   i don't wanna let you go  and i don't wanna let you leave can't say i didn't let you breathe gave you extra cheese put you in the SUV you wanted ice so i made you freeze made you hot like the west indies    extra cheese?  am I supposed to understand that?   urlLink J-Kwon  - Tipsy No doubt, this song is catchy.  But shame on you J-Kwon for promoting underage drinking! The lyrics for this song let us know that J-Kwon is interested in fine young woman (a.k.a. shorty) who is angry with her man, already has a child, but swears she's had her tubes tied.  Did I mention that he's not sure if she's 21?  This is a very exciting night for J-Kwon as we find out later:   ...she started feelin on my johnson right out the blue, girl you super thick so I'm thinkin that's koo   3 questions here: is koo a word now? since when is it so koo to be super thick?  does super thick mean what I think it means?   urlLink Christina Milian  -  urlLink Dip It Low  let me just start off with the lyrics on this one.   Dip it low Pick it up slow Roll it all around Poke it out like your back broke Pop pop pop that thing Ima show you how to make your man say "Ooo"    First of all, I don't need a 22 year old (who says "songs on this album have a little more depth to them") show me how to make my man say Oooo.  And poke it out like my back broke?  That's not okay.  I better stop here, I fear I've proved I'm beyond uncool.  Besides I heard Sears is having a sale on elastic waist pants tomorrow, so it's just as well I get my rest.

      You knew I would see  urlLink it  on opening weekend.  Unfortunately I had a lounge day yesterday, which meant sitting in my pajamas and watching TV for a healthy portion of the day.  Which led to me watch every Dodgeball preview, interview and behind the scenes special.  Which led to a very unsurprising first hour of the movie for me today.  As a matter of fact after having watched all that stuff I think I had already seen the first hour of the movie.    See what happens when I don't use TiVo?

      The grocery store has a little sign above each express line which tells you how many items (or less) you may have.  What the sign does not state is that you may not be a moron to use such line, and if you are going to act like an idiot, please step aside.  I fear that I may sound like a bitter little freak here, but when I get in an express line I expect it to be speedy.  Today I chose an express line with only two people waiting; a woman eggs and paper towels at the front of the line followed by another woman with a loaf of bread and three cans, then my turn. This seemed promising, I'll be out in no time!  So promising, until I realized that Eggs and Paper Towels was destined to write a check... or a novel, it was hard to tell.    I know that some people are afraid of bank cards, my Mom is one of them, but she tends to carry enough cash to pay for eggs and paper towels.  And if she didn't have enough cash she would definitely have her checkbook and ID ready by the time she reached the counter.   And  she would be writing the name of the store on the check while simultaneously placing her items on the belt.  We are a very efficient family.  The woman at the front of the line today had nothing to do with efficiency.    I was nice and calm when the cashier told Eggs and Paper Towels her total and she slowly reached for her checkbook.  I kept my cool as she searched in her bag for a pen, overlooking the one sitting on the counter.  I shifted my weight (in a passive aggressive way) when she asked him for the total again.  I felt my heart rate going up as she kept writing and writing and writing. How much could she possibly fit on that itty bitty check?  Some relief passed over my psyche when she tore the check from the book, but the relief was soon swept away when the cashier asked for her ID.  He asked her twice, once while she was filling out the register in her check book and again while she was putting her pen away. Once Eggs and Paper Towels understood what was being requested of her she began to root around in her cavernous purse for her missing ID, laughing and chatting the entire time.  In front of me Loaf of Bread and Three Cans let out a very loud and sad sigh, we rolled our eyes at each other.  About 5 minutes later Eggs and Paper Towels was grabbing her bag and looking as if she was going to leave when she decided this would be the best time to ask the cashier about those neat little self check out stations to our right.  Oh, how I wished I was at one of those self check out stations.  The ever helpful cashier told her all about the machines, the people using them, where babies come from and how the universe was created.  Then they sat down and had a cup of tea and she found some crumpets in her giant purse.  Loaf of Bread and Three Cans turned to me and wept, then we cried ourselves to sleep.

      My best friend,  urlLink Lisa (who I've known for 21 years), is getting married this year.  She's been pretty busy and a little stressed out, so I tried to do a few things to help her out.  One of the things I did was open accounts on both the  urlLink Knot  and the  urlLink Wedding Channel  for her, so she could get ideas and perhaps chat with other brides to be.    This all seemed like a very good idea until my  urlLink OCD  came back into play. What tragically happened is that I started looking at these sites more than Lisa does.  "More than Lisa" is most likely an understatement, because I don't think she's even had time to check them out yet.  Then on the other hand you have me, the un-bride, who can't stop going to these sites.  I've checked them everyday for the past week.  Addicted to the message boards filled with the desperate rants of pre and post brides. I found myself getting fired up over these stories and journals I've been reading.  Some of these women are fucking nuts.  It started off pretty harmless, there I was just browsing around looking for recommendations for caterers, but then the next thing I knew 2 hours had passed.  I had been clicking link after link after link; reading about how a mother of the groom was mad because there would be a keg at the reception, or how a bridesmaid was pregnant and due around this bride's wedding date and how tacky and thoughtless that bridesmaid was. Many brides wrote about going so far as "demoting" their maid of honor. I was in pure disbelief of these women. I tried to stop myself from reading these stories of practice hair-do appointments, custom made t-shirts, and mint julep votive candle holders but I couldn't, I just kept on reading, my jaw on the floor.  I guess since reality TV is so dry right now I needed to go somewhere to get my fix.  The first thing I had to figure out was what everything meant: FI = Fiance (or FH for Future Husband), FIL = Future in Laws, MOH = Maid of Honor, etc.. For some reason it took me a little while to figure them out, I guess I never thought of abbreviating those things, probably because I never had to.  I did (and still do) think using BM to refer to your closest friends, your Bridesmaids, is a little uncouth, but I guess when you're a fast and furious bride-to-be you don't have time to type the  whole  word.  Next I realized that the Knot is much more classy than the Wedding Channel, so of course I spent all my time on the Wedding Channel.  Then I had to find out how to look at these people's pictures.  It wasn't enough to just read about the chair covers for the reception (even though the FI thought they were too pricey), I had to  see  them.  I entered a whole new world. I gazed upon picture after picture of people I don't, and will never, know. Giddy brides at their final fitting, couples shoving cake into each other's mouths, tiaras pinned to piles of curls, cascading flowers hung on pews. Whole wedding albums have been posted.  Unbelievable.  Then what really floored me was this...  Some of these ladies who post on the boards have already been married for 3 (or more) years, but they continue to talk about their wedding like it was yesterday.  It blows my mind that anyone feels this way.  I love a wedding as much as the next gal, but this seemed very overboard to me.  I suppose my passions lie elsewhere and I always assumed these boards were only used as a tool.  But weddings and being a wife (and giving advice on how to do both) seem to be a pretty big deal to these people. Then I started to realize that many of these women had become friends through a support group system and now would go through motherhood together, online.  Not only were their wedding albums posted, but now there were pictures of their children.  Or if the children were not born yet, pictures of ultrasounds and bellies containing children.  Some women have even posted their fertility charts.  That's right, I repeat: women on these message boards POST THEIR FERTILITY CHARTS.       and i looked at them.  It seemed so strange to me, all of a sudden I felt like a minority, as if there was this secret bride society no one ever invited me to.  Which is okay.  I suppose these women find their support where they need to: online.  For me... when it comes to things like the details of my wedding day and my ovaries I'd rather keep it a little closer to home.  So should I ever have a fertility chart you can bet your bippy you won't be seeing it on this blog.  I went cold turkey today, I broke up with the message boards, and I'm doing just fine.  I don't have any signs of wedding withdrawal and now I just hope that Lisa doesn't fall prey to these evil, evil addictive boards.

      Alex's brother came out to visit for the weekend.  It was a lot of fun, but it's been awhile since I've been awake past 1:30am... for 3 consecutive nights.  I'm still feeling the burn.  Wow, I sound like a big loser. But we did have good times; we ate lots of  urlLink food , had drinks, watched a hilarious  urlLink movie , took a walk at the  urlLink Albany Bulb , tasted some  urlLink sake  and tried our best at a  urlLink Pub Quiz . here are some pics.    gates at Albany Bulb  urlLink    Bob and Alex at the bulb  urlLink    Alex and Bob at sculpture  urlLink    sculpture at Bulb  urlLink    how to make sake  urlLink    sake barrel  urlLink    sake factory  urlLink

      My friend Greg is one great character.  He's 100% lovable with just a dash of goofy and a tendency to be accident prone.  It's pretty common for him to walk into something or drop something and then trip over it... you get the idea.  That's just one of the reasons why he's so darn fun, especially because he has a great sense of humor about it.    For his birthday Greg put a big ol' rafting trip together.  There were 18 of us there and it was an overnight deal where the company provided tents and everything.  That night Greg decided to enjoy the fresh night air and sleep outside.  To do this and avoid freezing he wore his trusty wool hat to keep him warm.  This wool hat had strings to tie under his chin so that his head may stay warm no matter how much he tossed and turned during the night. In the morning one by one we straggled out of our tents to find a groggy Greg struggling to untie the knot that forced his warm wool hat to remain on his head.  He tried pulling the hat off.  He tried pulling the string over his face, resulting in comical pig-like nose and cheek contortions.  He tried biting the strings.  I had a go at it, and I'll tell you, that knot was like a pebble, it wasn't going anywhere.  The whole lot of us had many laughs as we gave our unsolicited advise to Greg.  "Cut it, cut it, cut it."  Eventually someone defeated the string without the cutting we all chanted for, leaving Greg's hat in tact.  His pride... well, I think that was okay too, because he was still laughing.  We split up into 3 groups after breakfast for the actual rafting trip. Although my group did not include Greg we all talked about the hat incident and told our guide about it.  As it would happen, the rafts would meet up periodically and as we cruised up to Greg's raft for the first time our guide asked (unprompted), "Are you the one who couldn't get your hat off this morning?"  It was hilarious, both rafts were laughing it up, but I don't think Greg thought it was so funny this time.  I felt a little bad for having told our guide about it. sorry, Greg.  But I think Greg may have felt a little better when the string karma came back to bite me in the ass last week.    I was wearing an ill fitting pair of Gap pants, which I often complain about. every single time I wear them.  These pants have a fly and a button, but they also have a drawstring.  I guess this is the Gap's cop out on not having to fit a specific waist size. So last Thursday I was down in Greg's office chatting it up and when I was on my way back upstairs I realized I had to pee.  I stopped in the bathroom that I hate, the one with 3 inches of space in between the stall door and the wall, which makes it easy for anyone who walks into that bathroom to see who is taking a leak.  Nevertheless, I had to go, so there I was keeping an eye on who was coming in while trying to untie my drawstring pants.  And then I kept trying to untie my drawstring pants.  Two people came and left, probably wondering what the hell I was doing, because you can clearly see in the stall.  And you know what happened then?  I was still trying to untie my drawstring pants.  A knot to rival the knot of Greg was thrust upon me, making it impossible to pee.  After about 10 minutes I admitted defeat, and zipped and buttoned up my ill fitting pants and headed back to my desk.  I thought about cutting the strings off, but I kind of needed them to keep the pants up.  I looked for further options in my trusty pen mug, and next to the scissors which were taunting me I saw a letter opener which I thought would be perfect for trying to loosen the knot.  I spent about 5 minutes debating whether it would be crazier to take the letter opener into the restroom with me or to sit in my cubicle fiddling with a letter opener near my crotch.  For some reason I chose the latter which resulted in strange looks and a fair amount of humiliation.  But I finally got the knot out, dammit!  and then I apologized to Greg.

      This past Sunday I participated in my first ever Bay Area Night Games, fondly referred to as BANG.  This was actually number  urlLink 7  in the series, and Greg has often encouraged me to participate, but not being much of a puzzle person, I always decline.  This time, however, I joined up with a team called The Biatches and we had a great time.  It was me, Jen and Elaine; although we were not having the best luck solving the puzzles we were quite adept at navigating with the map  and  we were also very talented when it came to opening the envelopes with the hints and answers, not one of us got a paper cut!  As you can see our team didn't fair too well on the scoreboard, but we were sassy.  I might go so far as to say we were razzmatazzy.  I've helped Greg and fellow puzzle dude Dave put together  urlLink Park Challenge  in Golden Gate Park before.  Organizing these races (registration, putting packets together, etc.) is where my strengths lie, but when it comes to doing (or even testing) these puzzles I fall short.  very short.  Which is why I've always been so hesitant to join in.  Put me behind a desk with some information and confused people standing before me and I'm in!  But put a bunch of lines, numbers or pictures in front of my face and tell me to make sense of it and I panic.  I guess what it boils down to is the human thang... no one wants to feel stupid.  And I'm actually not that bad of a puzzle solver, I could just use a little practice.  okay, a lot of practice.  The key for my enjoyment on Sunday was this: I left my editor at home for BANG and decided that even if I couldn't solve any of the puzzles I wouldn't let myself feel stupid.  And without that dang editor I had a more fun than I've had in awhile.  So screw you, editor, you're not invited to anymore puzzle races.  I'm definitely going to the next BANG.  It's BANG 8 and it's in the  urlLink Haight .So catchy how could I go wrong?  Here are some photos I managed to sneak in while not opening hint envelopes: Jen and Elaine hiking downhill (from an unsolved puzzle)  urlLink     my fellow Biatch, Jen  urlLink     my other fellow Biatch, Elaine  urlLink     Greg's team, Desert Taxi.  urlLink

      Dear  urlLink Hilary Duff ,  I really do wish your  urlLink lips were sealed , because then you would stop destroying classic 80s songs which defined how I would rock out.    I didn't know that you had a sister... and I guess it makes more sense to sing the lyrics "our lips" with another person rather than by yourself.  But did your video have to be so darn skanky?  That's your sister, and it's okay to share blouses, but it's never okay to bite.  You should never sink your teeth into a sibling - especially in that weird kind-of-trying-to-be-sexy way.   In the future if you could only do covers of Backstreet Boys, Jessica Simpson and Right Said Fred songs that would be swell.    Thanks! Love, c  p.s. Take it easy on the lip gloss, you look like you just ate at KFC.

      Friday is a slow day for me... which lead me to browse crappy news, which lead me to read  urlLink this  (if you scroll down you'll find this):  ANNA NICOLE'S GHOST SEX Busty Anna Nicole Smith once had a ghostly mate she says used to make love to her when she was living in Dallas. The blonde reality TV star never complained because her weird romps were among the best she's ever had.   She explains, "I used to think it was my boyfriend, and one day I woke up and it wasn't. It was like a spirit. I was freaked out about it, but then I was like, 'Well, you know what? He's never hurt me and he just gave me some amazing sex, so I have no problem.'"

      Grand Canyon at sunrise   urlLink     I never finished writing about our vacation, but I do have plenty of photos; this is one of the 3057 I took at sunrise.  okay, I didn't really take that many, but I did go a little overboard.  And I was completely under dressed.  I didn't think about how cold it would be before sunrise in the park.  Luckily we had a blanket in the back of the car and Alex was kind enough to let me use it like a thick and hideous skirt over my thin and not-wind-resistant pants.  A backpack also serves nicely when trying to keep your back warm.

      as you leave today RM, you must know, you were in my dreams last night.    I was put into a deep trance by the Democrats, and unleashed upon the country to carry out John Kerry's bidding. You were put into an uninterrupted sleep by the Republicans, becoming a public servant for George Bush.  When I awoke 3 months later, Greg alerted me to what had been happening.  You were no longer a Bush zombie, but you knew too much, and Greg made it clear that you had to be destroyed.  And even though I didn't officially work for John Kerry anymore I was okay with the whole plan once the gun was handed to me.  I met you on the street, under the guise that we were going to see some dinner theatre with a group of friends.  We met privately, I hugged you, asked you how you were doing and then pulled out my shiny silver gun.  Aiming square for your chest I shot a bullet into your upper left thigh, to which you replied "hey... ouch".  I tried to look embarrassed and excused myself.  I ran to Greg and asked him to handle the situation.  It was at this moment I realized I was no longer in a trance.  Not only did feel sick with the thought of dealing with the guilt of killing my friend, I really didn't want to KILL MY FRIEND.  So Greg and I played it off like it was all a big joke and gave you a tourniquet.  You, with a cigarette in your mouth, said it was no problem.  You took the tourniquet and tied it off with aplomb while asking what dinner theatre we were going to.    I felt sad that I had shot you, but what was even sadder was the fact you were forced to work for George Bush.

      Alex recently purchased some new  urlLink phones  that are out of my league of technology know-how.  There are three handsets along with one base. The base is an answering machine and can also be used as a speaker phone. Each of these handsets can be used like walkie talkies or even baby monitors. You can pick different rings on each phone for different people.  Each phone can have it's own phonebook.  There's even a headset you can use and pretend to be Judy the Time-Life operator.   All of these fancy units reside in our small two bedroom apartment.  So when someone calls, cacophonous digital blips can be heard echoing throughout the apartment, because each phone has a unique sound.  These phones did not receive a warm welcome for me because they made me feel stupid.  I was also not fond of the big fat manual that came with the phones; I think it is inappropriate to have a text book in order to call your friends.  At first I was scared of the phones and my fear resulted in some displaced anger, but now I'm starting to like the phones and I even feel comfortable looking like a big dork walking around with the headset on.  After about a week I faced my fear and finally figured out how to turn down or even shut off the ringers.   The cool thing about having four different phones to use is that means there are four places I can easily see caller ID.  I don't have to run to the living room anymore just to see that it's a telemarketer on the line.  Now I can just casually turn to closest unit, which is usually an arm's reach away.  Sure, I know I could have taken my former cordless phone and put in next to me in whatever room I was in, but then it would have died by the time it got through it's first ring (thus the reason for the new phone purchase).   Tonight it delighted me greatly to just be able to turn my head to the right and decide not to answer that phone call from a caller named Modise Tay.  Although with a caller ID like that, it might have been worth the small walk.

      Sometimes I watch TV when I'm feeling kind of blue.  Then I get a little happier and feel like I personally know the people in the box who just cheered me up.  Two of my favorite people to watch are  urlLink Will Arnett  and  urlLink Amy Poehler  and I just found out they are married.  I can't believe they didn't invite me to their wedding.

      Last Saturday Greg and Dave participated in the San Francisco  urlLink Urban Challenge .    urlLink Britt ,  urlLink Chris  and I were the support staff, which meant I got to sit at home in my jammies and drink three pints of coffee while Googling things and sending text messages to Greg and Dave who were running and sweating all over San Francisco.  Chris was a mad dog and our leader.  He was in charge of all things internet, things that are beyond my comprehension.  Even though Greg and Dave were the last team to start the race (due to an unwieldy #2 pencil let loose on a scantron form) they came in 4th and they're going to Miami in November.  If you check out the "results" part of the website, Greg and Dave are Team 4, but their pic is showing up in the team 3 slot.  The other weird thing about the website is that they only have 3 checkpoints up there, but there were actually 12.  Here are some things I learned while fulfilling my duties as a Google girl:  * Peekskill was not a fake city where the  urlLink Facts of Life  took place.  There's a real city in New York called Peekskill and it got it's name from the Dutch explorer Jan Peek.  * It's hard to type, drink coffee and answer the phone all at once.  * Horse in Spanish is caballo.  * There are  urlLink tons  of  urlLink websites  dedicated to  urlLink palindromes .   * My favorite palindrome is: Go hang a salami; I'm a lasagna hog  * I will never understand how to solve a magic square math puzzle.  ever.  * Chris Chan is like a frickin human computer.  * In 1962 a dude named Melvin Belli (a lawyer kind of dude) sued the San Francisco Giants on the grounds that his box seat at Candlestick Park was too cold. And he won.  * Greg's "I'm concentrating while taking this picture" look is very consistent. See?   urlLink      urlLink      urlLink

      and I'm not just saying it's crappy because I got four hours of sleep, or because the coffee maker broke, or because I have a MIR space station sized pimple on my chin making me look like a witch. It was truly a crappy morning because my toilet decided to purge itself of any items it had digested within the last 48 hours.   I began my day with a 6:30 wake up (after having gone to bed at 2:00) followed by an ant crawling across my pillow and onto my face. When I finally managed to drag myself out of bed Alex kindly let me know that he didn't put enough water in the coffee maker, so there was just a smidgen of really strong coffee left for me, if I wanted it. I decided to make new coffee and upon doing this noticed that Alex had put plenty of water in, but the coffee maker was busted. I tried to fix the coffee maker, and while working on this impossible task, realized that this thing which supplies me with delicious coffee every morning was actually the anti-Christ and the root of every problem I've ever had since I was 12. This led me to believe that the best thing to do would be to "Fonzie" the coffee maker. With one swift hit of my fist, three mysterious and small plastic pieces flung onto the countertop. So long, coffee maker, thanks for the memories. I pulled the old tiny coffee maker out of hiding and began my brewing again.   With breakfast finally out of the way it was time to get ready for work. I knew things were bad when I was taking a shower and noticed water wasn't draining, but instead kept accumulating along with hair and soap scum. This has been happening for weeks, but the water never got this deep.   Then I flushed the toilet.   Alex and I always put the toilet lid down after each use, because that way it's fair all around. Everyone has to put something down, regardless of how you use the toilet. (And I don't know if Zach the cat would ever want to drink toilet water, but this way we don't have to find out.) I put the lid down before the fateful flush and while washing my hands noticed something out of the corner of my eye; was the lid moving? Oh yeah, the lid was moving, and all sorts of unpleasant water was moving that lid. Powered by sheer panic and adrenaline I was able to move the scale and the litter box before anything coming from within Village plumbing reached them. Then I started thinking plunger. I knew we used to have a plunger, was it under the sink? was it in the closet? was it outside? was it in the outside storage? was I sure I didn't see it under the sink? We  used  to have a plunger. I guess a plunger isn't one of the things you take with you when you move. I'm not going to get into details here, but I will let you know that I will be buying a new toilet brush this evening and even though Swiffers are fun little moppy things to have around, it's very important to always have legit mop in the house.   Even after my cleaning and creative problem solving, the toilet was still not doing so well, so I had to call maintenance; something had to be done that was out of my realm of toilet knowledge. I called the Village office and then ran around hiding all things cat-like and hoped to skedaddle before the maintenance dude got there. Alas, I wasn't fast enough. For some reason I find it humiliating to explain a mess in my bathroom to a maintenance guy. As I opened the door my gut reaction was to say "It's not my fault," because honestly, it wasn't! But what came out was "sorry." That's a fine how-do-you-do to a man with a plunger in his hand. I just know that I would never want his job, so I have an immense amount of respect and sympathy for the guy, thus the sorry.   I stuck around while he finished whatever he did. He worked some plumbing magic that even fixed the tub! I would have offered him some coffee, but I didn't want to revisit that trauma.   The rest day didn't turn out all bad though; lunch with Sean and Greg had me feeling better and then Jerome sent me  urlLink this . I think I'm on the road to recovery. I even used a toilet again today and didn't flinch before flushing.

      Today I was doing a little fake shopping and took a trip to Amazon.com to look at things I will&nbsp; never buy, it's like window shopping, only without the benefit exercise.&nbsp; The fine folks of Amazon surprised me&nbsp;because the first page I landed on (when signed in under my Amazon account) was my Plog.&nbsp; Plog? What? I never posted anything on Amazon.&nbsp; Oh, I see, since they track everything I look at, click on, put on my wish list, purchase or even dream about they seem to think they know me well enough to create a blog, sorry,  plog,  for little ol'&nbsp;me!   I can't think of anything more exciting and informative than marketing blurbs disguised as blog postings created by Amazon... telling me what  they  think  I  think will be interesting.&nbsp; Here's how they explain the Plog:    The Plog™ Service is a personalized blog. A blog is a straightforward and now widely adopted method of posting a reverse chronological diary on the Internet.  Your Amazon.com Plog is a diary of events that will enhance your shopping experience, helping you discover products that have just been released, track changes to your orders, and many other things. Just like a blog, your Plog is sorted in reverse chronological order. When we think we have something interesting or important to tell you, we'll post it to your Plog.   (They also have a list of 15 blogs which they describe as "some of the best and most popular blogs", go on and check it out, you know you want to.)   Enhance my shopping experience? I can think of&nbsp;some better things to enhance, but okay Amazon... try me.   A mysterious Amazon&nbsp;blogger (a.k.a. computer)&nbsp;posts&nbsp;on random days telling me what newly released item I would like to buy (a  urlLink book  which is already on my Wish List) because of what I have already purchased (a  urlLink book  I bought as a gift  three  years ago). Anonymous Amazon blogger then gives me all sorts of pertinent information on the product they are sure I would love to purchase. At the bottom of each post there are two handy little bubbles, which are located where the comments are on most blogs, and these bubbles give me the option to let Amazon know if this post was helpful or not. Wait a minute! Isn't this MY Plog? If my name is on this Plog shouldn't everything be helpful?&nbsp; Oh, okay, I have a little control here...&nbsp; if I so desire I can clear any post. Just delete it with one swift click of the "clear post" link.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot create a post, only anonymous blogger can do that.&nbsp; Corinne's Plog is written by someone else.&nbsp; I do not feel enhanced.&nbsp; My experience is not improved.   I find the entire idea of this Plog pretty ominous.&nbsp; To be honest, Amazon already creeped me out because of their uber tracking powers, but the Plog took it one step too far.&nbsp; It's basically the equivalent to some dude following me around a store with a dogeared note pad and chewed up pencil.&nbsp; He hides at the end of aisles and waits until I pick something up,&nbsp; then he takes dirty reading glasses out of his rumpled suit jacket pocket and makes a note of&nbsp;which item I've chosen and how long it's been in my hand.&nbsp; He licks the end of his pencil and nods in a slow methodical fashion.&nbsp; I put the item down, and notice something out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; He scurries behind a bookcase and scribbles some more.&nbsp; I continue to shop, he secretly follows.&nbsp; This goes on all day.&nbsp; Later that night I find an envelope has been slipped under my door.&nbsp; Inside this envelope is a neatly typed note, kindly letting me know that there may have been some items I overlooked in the store I visited that day. At the bottom of the letter, following suggestions for future purchases, are carefully drawn pie charts and bar graphs.&nbsp; I break out in a cold sweat as I crumple the letter and carefully look around.&nbsp; I hear an evil laugh followed by "see you around!"&nbsp;and then the sound of fleeting footsteps.&nbsp; I am forever tainted and know that&nbsp;I can never recklessly window shop again.

      It's sad, but true.  I fell into a some sort of stupor and checked those damn  urlLink message boards  again. Those brides... every time I think I'm done with them, their siren song lures me in and I take a walk down that dark tunnel of no return.  It's a very slippery slope.  I recently read all about a bride who cancelled her wedding with only 99 days to go. I got all the 411 about what to do when your future mother in law refuses to wear a dress to the wedding, but a jacket and slacks instead.  The horror!  But I also did find this very special list and I would like to share it with you:  AW = "Attention Whore"  BC, BCP = birth control, birth control pills  BF = Boyfriend or Best Friend  BM = Bridesmaid or Best Man  BP = Bridal Party  DF = Dear (or darned, or dratted) Fiancé  DH = Dear Husband  E-ring = engagement ring  E-party = engagement party  FG = Flower Girl  FI = Fiancé (male) or Fiancée (female)  FIL = Father In Law  FILs = Future in-laws, sometimes referred to as:  FBIL = Future Brother-in-law  FFIL = Future Father-in-law  FMIL = Future Mother-in-law  FSIL = Future Sister-in-law  GF = Girlfriend  GM = Groomsmen  GTG = a Knottie get-together  HM = Honeymoon  HTH = Hope this helps  IHO = In Honor Of  ILs = In-laws  IMHO = In my humble opinion  IMNSHO = In my not so humble opinion  JK = just kidding, or joking  JP = Justice of the Peace  LMAO = Laughing my @ss off  LOL = Laughing out loud  LTBM = Living together before marriage  MIL = Mother In Law  MOH = Maid / Matron of Honor  MS = Martha Stewart  NFP = natural family planning  NFT = No Further Text  NMS = Not my style  NWMT = Not worth my time  NWR = Not Wedding Related  OMG = Oh my gosh / god  P&E = Planning and Etiquette board  PIB = Pictures in Bio  PSA = Public Service Announcement  RB = Ring Bearer  RD = Rehearsal Dinner  RP = Repost  SAHM = stay-at-home mom  SAHW = stay-at-home wife  SBD = South Beach Diet  STDs = Save The Date cards  TIA = Thanks In Advance  TMI = Too Much Information  TROLL = Someone posting a fake question or a nasty reply to get a reaction  TTC = Trying to conceive  TY = Thank you  WP = wedding party WW = Weight Watchers  XP = Cross posted (posted to more than one board)   Attention Whore?  I didn't know there was such a whore.  Fabulous!  Where can I get one? But what I really love is the fact that if you want everyone to mark their calendars for your special day you better make sure that each person on your guest list gets your STDs ASAP.

      I guess I watch more reality TV than I ought to.    Last night I had a dream in which I was on a new reality show.  I had to live on a boat with  urlLink Ashton Kutcher ,  urlLink P Diddy ,  urlLink Alexis Bledel ,  urlLink Nick Lachey  and my very own sweetheart, Alex.    It was a large boat, yacht-like, and we were collectively supposed to figure out how to get this boat from wherever we were to an island off the coast of somewhere.  This boat was huge and I remember thinking that we wouldn't have enough gas.  I complained about gas a lot.  No one listened.  Cameras caught me acting like this.  I knew I was going to look bad.  Everyone was pretty excited and instead of thinking about gas (or how to steer the boat) they all decided to inspect the digs.  I gave in (there's that peer pressure again!) and while we were checking out every nook and cranny of our new living quarters, the boat careened into a rock and suffered a big ol' hole in the front. Diddy and Ashton went to check it out, but only Alex and Nick would swim down to look at the hole.  Alexis and I stood on the deck and bonded.  Eventually, somehow, the hole got fixed, but not before Ashton decided to bail.  As he thought about how potentially hazardous the rest of the trip could be he realized he could still see the main land and swam to safety. Then there were five.  All things back to normal, we had a big party with champagne and everything. Alex got pretty drunk and passed out in our brand new boat bedroom.  Instead of breathing, or even snoring, he was burping. Burp in, burp out, like breathing, but much more obnoxious.  I couldn't sleep in there with him, so I decided to bunk in one giant bed with P. Diddy and Alexis.  They were happy to accommodate me until burpy Alex came in and tried to puke on my face.  I put the sheet over my face before I saw any vomit and then woke up.  Wouldn't that have made some compelling reality TV? There's nothing like watching a boring control freak bitch out celebrities who don't give a rat's ass about how much gas is in a boat! How exciting is it to watch someone puke on their own wife?   As it turns out, Alex alerted me to the fact that our cat was actually retching in the hallway during this dream.  Not so compelling now, is it?

      Shopping at  urlLink Costco  is a favorite past time of mine, it takes courage and skill to navigate those aisles with an oversized carriage.  It takes years of training to lift that 25 pound bag of frozen stuff and get it in the cart without crushing the 85 hamburger buns you just put in there.  It takes willpower to pass up giant boxes of pens.    I went to Costco by myself before the 4th of July, which is odd for me, because ever since Alex and I got married he's been my Costco buddy.  Our vows stated that we would always stand side by side, especially in warehouse situations.  He was busy though, and I had to go it alone.  Alone, for me, sometimes involves bad decisions.  This solo trip to Costco brought about what I like to call  the four bean salad incident .  I bought a jar of  urlLink four bean salad .  I like the bean salad.  I like it so much that I figured everyone would like it.  I bought a half gallon worth of beans.    That delicious bean salad proudly sat on the kitchen table for our lame barbecue on the 4th, and that's all it did.  It remained covered in it's pretty little Corningware dish, untouched for hours.  At one point I lifted the cover and toyed with the idea of scooping some on to my plate, but then a victim of peer pressure, I joined the masses and made fun of my own beloved four bean salad.  I mocked the beans which I hold so dear.  Now I am stuck with a half gallon of this stuff and I've been eating it all week.  I've hardly made a dent in it.  At this point I'm making an ass of myself and only eating it to spite everyone; I'll show them how wonderfully scrumptious these beans are!  How foolish they were to walk away from such greatness!  I brought it to lunch yesterday and made a point to comment on how YUMMY the four bean salad was.  People looked in my general direction and nodded.  Today I ate lunch at my desk and felt the sinking shame of falling out of love with my salad.  So I am left with the following questions: how do I just let all that bean salad go? and, does anyone want some four bean salad?

      Sometimes Wednesday night is Ladies' Night with Julianne and Molly.  Last night was one of those nights, and it included  urlLink drinks and tapas  followed by a  urlLink movie .  I'm not going to write about the movie today because it got me a little depressed.  And I'm not sure if it made me feel better or worse to get home and open a letter from John Kerry asking for money, because "The success of our campaign depends on having a strong and active group of supporters."  (Can  I be a supporter even if I don't send you 25 bucks?  Will you really lose without my money?)  But I did have a good time being out and about on a school night. If there was ever a sure sign of being in my 30s, I think that having a designated evening called "Ladies' Night" might be the appropriate milestone, and I'm okay with that.     Since I'm not going to write about the movie, I will instead tell you all about a few of the people attending the movie.  It was a sold out show, and even with new fancy pants stadium seating it can seem a little cramped in the theatre.  I don't mind not having a buffer seat though, because isn't it always a new adventure to sit next to a complete stranger?  You never know what's going to happen!  Here's the first thing I heard from the gentlemen to my right (who were obviously together):   Tall Dude: I think I have to go to the bathroom. Bitter Dude: So you want me to  moooove ? Tall Dude: Unless you want me to piss in your face.  Bitter Dude moves his legs and allows Tall Dude to pass.  Tall Dude awkwardly squeezes through the aisle without allowing sufficient time for me to move my legs, Molly to lift her bag or Julianne to get her foot out of the way.  He steps over the last two people in the row.  As he's leaving for the restroom Young Couple (frantically looking for seats together) spots two seats together in our row; one of the seats is still warm from Tall Dude, the other seat is the buffer seat for Tall Dude, to separate him from the unworthy throng.  But there is a bonus third seat in our row (to the left of Julianne) and if Dudes would move one measly seat over to the right then Julianne, Molly and I could all move over, and Young Couple would be ever so grateful.  Since Bitter Dude refuses to acknowledge Young Couple hoping to sit together, Julianne and Molly explain the situation to Girl of Young Couple.  I then turn to Bitter Dude and ask if he would move down a seat, to which he responds (with his mouth full of peanut M&Ms) "well, my friend isn't here, so I can't speak for him, or ask him."  Molly and I laugh.  Bitter Dude continues to shove M&Ms into his angry little mouth.  Before Tall Dude even returns to make the all important decision about the seat to his right, the other half of our row moves to the left, obliterating Tall Dude's buffer seat.  Girl of Young Couple shrugs and sits next to Julianne.  She turns around and makes sad face to Guy of Young Couple 3 rows away.  Tall Dude returns, without stepping on anyone this time, because we all stand up.  The movie starts.  Bitter Dude eats the most epic bag of M&Ms ever, taking them from the crinkling bag ONE. AT. A. TIME.  For the entire length of the movie.  I think it might have been better if Tall Dude  had  just pissed in Bitter Dude's face after all.

      but the Bay Area just is not a fun place for the 4th of July.  Last year Alex and I walked out to the extremely windy and cold  urlLink Albany Waterfront Park  and sat on some cement blocks which sucked any remaining heat out of our bodies.  We saw 5 different firework shows, but I admit that I spent some of my time on that cement block slightly cranky and very cold.  The bottle of wine we brought with us helped to create a little artificial warmth and the fireworks cheered me up, but having grown up in Boston always leaves me to expect more on the 4th than drinking mediocre wine on a landfill while watching very distant explosives.  In my attempt to be All American for a day I bought and consumed too much food, because isn't that what Americans are best known for?  Apart from the food front we had a pretty unpatriotic day.  Our 4th felt more like a rainy Sunday afternoon get together than a barbecue.  The typical July chill of our close-to-the-water neighborhood kept us indoors for most of the day, the time I spent on our patio was to warm my hands and lower back by the gas grill.  To keep our guest amused indoors we ended up playing a lot of  urlLink Eye Toy  and watching some Tenacious D.   Around 7:00 the real crappy weather rolled in. Our plan was to walk down to the park (like last year) and see what we could see.  When everyone started to hear of these plans it got real quiet-like.  Half of the group made the wise choice to head to back to their warm homes and drink tea.  The other half of us bundled up and pessimistically headed to the park.    Once we got the beach we could feel the cold mist on our faces and the closer we got to the water the wind picked up.  Greg had made the comment earlier that the Albany Bulb seemed like a "tetanus-y" place to watch fireworks... and he was right, it was a little sketchy finding somewhere for 5 of us to sit, but as it turned out it didn't really matter where we sat, because there wasn't anything to see.  We were able to make out faint colors and shapes of fireworks in the  urlLink Jack London Square  area, but the  urlLink Berkeley Marina  fireworks merely turned the cloud cover sad shades of green and red.  Forget about San Francisco or Marin.  Twenty five minutes on the cement blocks and we gave up.  To make our day seem like it was more fun than it actually was, I give you these dynamic Eye Toy photos.    urlLink      urlLink      urlLink

      If I were to click my heels like Dorothy and repeat "there's no place like home" I'm not sure if I would end up where I live now, or where I go to visit my family. There's no place like either of those places, and I don't really feel like I belong in one more than the other. I had a good trip to Boston in June and I'm about to go again because I really miss being there, but it's also kind of relaxing to be in my own space, with Alex, far away from everyone.  Last time I went to Boston I only had six days to reacquaint myself with the people (and places) who had a hand in molding me into this adult I'm supposed to be. In those six days I had the chance to see my old digs, hang with my family and spend some quality time with my  urlLink bestest friend .  My Mom's house was the first stop, I did a lot of visiting with aunts, uncles, cousins and I even got a little face time with the grand matriarch, Nana. But the best visits included those with my sister and nephew. Oh, how I miss them.   urlLink    Look at that face!  How can I live across the country from that guy?  The time with Mom, however, proved to be a little more stressful than I had imagined. It's not that she intentionally says or does things to rub me the wrong way, but she's my Mom. And you know how moms can be. The most exasperating part was getting from point A to point B. My Mom didn't learn how to drive until she was in her mid fifties and she is a bit of a nervous driver. (Now here's the part where you picture a 4'10" woman with  urlLink BluBlockers  in a very large  urlLink Grand Marquis .)   Her driving is a little on the slow side for my taste, but I give her some credit, because when you're nervous it's probably best to take your time. Although I do think that coming to a complete stop before turning may be a little excessive. She did take a particularly quick corner one day, but she gave me plenty of warning by informing me that we were about to "book it", so I was good and ready when we hit that speedy 7 miles an hour.  Mom is too nervous to risk leaving the surface streets though, which leaves the highway driving up to me... and Mom with the fake brake on the passenger's side. It takes a little getting used to a Grand Marquis, so I admit I wasn't the smoothest driver when it came to the stop signs and traffic lights, but cut me some slack, that's a lot of car to stop! Mom eventually eased up on the fake brake, but every turn or lane change I took was accompanied by a deep breath being gasped in through clenched teeth as if I was jabbing her with a burning hot poker. These wincing inhales were paired up with a firm grasp on the "oh shit" handle over the window of the passenger's side. Sometimes I was lucky enough to only get the  door  handle grab, a little more subtle. One time I actually got a double handle grab, that's the left hand reaching over to the door handle and the right hand reaching up to handle over the window.  *please note: this type of grab should only be attempted by a professional pessimist*  Often when switching lanes I was told that I was "a gutsy little devil" and asked if I was "aware of the merge." But there was one shining moment when she did compliment both me and my sister on our driving (while I was not driving). I know I shouldn't take the whole thing too personally, but I don't remember her freaking out in the car with my Dad. Is it me? Is it?  I'm going back to Boston at the end of next week to help Lisa out with some more wedding stuff, but I don't think I'll have time to see Mom again. Maybe I'll practice a little bit of the slow driving while I'm out there so I'll be ready for my trip in October... when I get to drive Mom to New Hampshire. A whole hour of fake brake, I can't wait. There's no place like home, there's no place like home.

      Last week marked the one year anniversary of the last week of my old job.  I would be lying if I said that I was devastated to leave that job. There are certainly some people I miss working with, but there are also some people I'm glad I don't ever have to deal with again, and the work itself... not so much the fun.  Perhaps it was because I extended myself more than I should have, maybe it was because I answered my work administered cell phone every time it rang, no matter what time it was, but after almost two years of being a company manager I couldn't bear the thought of booking another flight, prepping another apartment or listening to one more upset actor.  I started to crack at the end of May and finally by August I was on my way out. I was so eager to leave at that point that I didn't even have another job lined up and only two months of rent saved.  Probably not the best idea in the Bay Area, but I felt like I had no other choice.  The last show I worked on was one with "stars".  It was important for me to keep these stars happy, that was part of my job.  I was to accomplish star bliss by being extremely pleasant, insanely attentive and upholding all of the commitments made by others, many of which I was not aware of.  Most of these promises were made by the Super Powerful Ultimate Director (SPUD) of the company.    The first time I was aware of these clandestine deals was when I booked some business class plane tickets instead of first class. Even though I had the executed contracts in my hands, stating what I could and couldn't do or buy, I received some angry calls from managers in L.A. about my "out of line" purchases and was told that I was violating verbal agreements which were made by the SPUD  just yesterday .  I was asked more than once if I knew who I was dealing with.  I think I had a pretty good idea.  These people weren't even in town yet and I had knots in my stomach anticipating what else could possibly go wrong.   Then the best part came, I had the pleasure of picking up cast members at the airport.  It was a joy to be driving a filthy company car around and hear of all the promised wonders I was to provide for these stars; the special meals, the tours of the city and the comp tickets I had for them for other shows on their afternoon off. Granted, this was all part of my job and I had no problem fulfilling (or at least delegating) these requests, but it would have been nice if SPUD, who promised all these things, had let me know the specifics or even just said "hey, I promised all these people so much stuff I don't even  know  what I said, so good luck!"  I ended up looking like a bobblehead on these rides with the stars, smiling and nodding while driving, taking mental notes of what I needed to do. Sleep was lost on these days, rage persisted, so to avoid a break down I had my intern take over for a few airport runs. He too became miffed with the entire experience.  He liked to take his own pristine car to the airport and came back steaming one time because one of the cast members, who seemed to have brief bouts with narcolepsy, ate a crumbly muffin while dozing off in the front seat of his new car.   The show ran for eight weeks, with the cast changing every two weeks, so every other week held new and wonderful surprises for me.  Upon each arrival I could expect the unexpected and nothing was out of the realm of possibility.  I think the worst incident was being obliged to find soul food in Berkeley at 10:00pm on Sunday night, or maybe it was the time I had to find comfortable quarters and a watchful eye for a dog who had just had hip surgery and was on a fair amount of pain killers.  The 12 - 16 hour days I worked during the rehearsal and run of this show were wearing me down.  I was officially miserable.  Something had to be done.  I talked to my boss, who was the  coolest  boss I've ever had, and she said she would see what they could do to compensate me. She told me she would talk to the SPUD and let me know what they come up with.    The next day I was called into the SPUD's office.  The SPUD thanked me for all my hard work over the last few months and assured me that I was doing a bang up job. I sat there patiently while she told me how lucky I was to work with such stars and what a privilege it was for me to be able to get up close and personal with each and every one.  I did my usual routine of nodding and smiling, just like in the car, waiting for some sort of bonus or a mention of some extra vacation time to fly my way, just something more than words.  I had enough of the words, I wanted more.  And more is what I got.  As the SPUD got to the end of her speech she informed me she wanted to give me something to show her gratitude.  SPUD rolled her chair over to her purse and pulled out her personal checkbook.  As she carefully wrote on a check and handed it to me she was proud to announce that she found out my wedding anniversary had recently passed and she knew Alex and I were going camping for the weekend.  This personal check from SPUD was to say thank you for everything.  This personal check from SPUD was to be used to buy a nice bottle of champagne for my anniversary getaway.  This personal check from SPUD had a note that said "happy anniversary".  This personal check from SPUD was for the amount of $25.00.  I wasn't sure what to do.  The whole series of events simultaneously confused, irritated and amused me.  I thanked SPUD and left.  I told my boss about it and she chuckled told me that wasn't what she had in mind or discussed with SPUD in terms of compensation, but what could we do?  I shoved the check in my pocket and went home for the day.  I thought about framing the check and putting it above my desk, but then decided to cash it and buy a case of beer and some beef jerky.  A few days later I was sitting at my desk and SPUD came into the office with her son, as she often did on Friday afternoons, to check in with everyone.  SPUD seemed surprised to see me at my desk and asked why I wasn't on my anniversary camping trip.  I explained that I would be leaving after work that day.  SPUD looked out the window at the gloomy cloud cover and the following dialogue took place:  SPUD: Too bad you'll have such shitty weather. me: We're actually going a little further south, so I think it should be okay. SPUD: Oh, well, if it does rain you can just stay in your tent and fuck all weekend! me: what? SPUD: Well, it's true!  Tell Alex I said that's a direct order!  As if this exchange was not unfortunate enough, please keep in mind that there were about seven other people milling around the office to witness it, one of them being SPUD's son.   And that, my friends, was the straw that broke this camel's back, and when I decided I would quit my job.   At least I got a case of beer out of it.

      Yep, that's me.  I've emerged as the full fledged moron I knew lurked within for so many years.  This weekend opened the door to two experiences for me, one overpriced, one free, which both allow me to not only feel like a moron, but look like one, too.  Saturday was an expensive haircut that ended in the horror of looking in the mirror to find a spectacular mullet... on my very own head.  I guess the hairdresser was stressed out about her sick dog, but that was no reason to cut  all  my bangs off, was it?  This haircut had me running home to put my MGD in a beer  urlLink koozie , sit in my busted up lawn chair in my dirt yard and daydream about NASCAR.  Sunday was a 20 minute bike ride, which actually turned into a 20 mile bike ride, without sunscreen. Luckily I was only out between the hours of 11 - 2, so I wasted no time making sure I got as crispy as possible.  Sure this one was a freebie, but I assure you, I'm paying for it today.  My once pasty Irish arms are now an amazing hue of purple, emitting heat strong enough to cook a frozen bag of peas used to ease the pain.  So if you see me walking down the street and you pretend you don't know who I am, I'll understand, because I don't even want to be seen with this moron.
