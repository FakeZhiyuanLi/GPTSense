      I found a link to a great site, if you like The Onion kinda humor, from someone I kinda knew back in the punk rock scene in Memphis,  urlLink http://www.spazoutny.com .  That person happens to live in New York, but we weren't really friends, so shit, we didn't meet on my trip there the other day.  I had the most incredible experiences (yesterday) on this trip.  I shall relate all the interesting points here, which are almost innumerable, so this is going to be a substantially long document.  What are printers for,  urlLink to print ?  At 7am I found myself stranded in a hotel lobby near the JFK airport in Queens/Jamaica NYC.  I had driven to NYC once before but only with explicit directions to meet a friend at a convenient location where he guided me the rest of the unremarkable way to his street where I had parked my car for the remainder of this past visit.  My knowledge of the streets and layout of the city as a whole was pretty much limited to the FDR and the expressway leading back to the interstate back to Rhode Island.  Luckily, I possess an awesome road atlas, which is so awesome that it has details of some major US cities, including the NYC.  So, I had a small tool to get me close to my friend that I hoped to meet. I had driven into NYC with some folks the previous afternoon because they were flying out that morning at 9am.  I had decided that it would be impossible to find my friend in NYC the night before, so I was going to plan to find him the next day.  Of course he works late into the night and even communicating with him before the sojourn was difficult (since I work during the day).  It is obvious to me now that I had made a grave mistake in leaving the connecting path, between me being at the hotel near JFK and me transporting myself and my car in proximity to my friend in Brooklyn, undefined.    Instead I was on my own without even an address to set my sights on, and so I had to take a stab at it as best as I could.  I took my map and constructed a rough trajectory towards Brooklyn, where I believed some familiar sounding street names might serendipitously lead me to the dude's street and address. Between all the myriads of names and similarly identifiable visual locations, I somehow confused myself into believing my buddy lived in the southernmost neighborhoods of Brooklyn.  But actually, I convinced myself that it was arbitrary whether I parked near his place, since I had to travel the subway anyway to get where I had decided my new destination would be.  You see, it was just now about 8:30(am), and my friend would not be awake for at least a couple more hours, so I had to kill some time.  Driving was out of the question; I just knew I had to jettison my car, but not at the airport hotel, which everyone had discouraged me from doing at the outset already.  Well, I took this southern loop expressway, the Sunbelt loop or something that went along the coast.  From here I could burrow a bit northwards into Brooklyn at a safe distance from the bustling central areas of adjacent Manhattan, the deathtraps for automobiles.   I landed eventually, and I figured I was in an ok neighborhood, so I went for it. In retrospect, though, I was not in a very ideal area. From the nearest subway station, I rode the entire length out of Brooklyn and into Manhattan, where I hoped to catch a double-decker tour bus.    This would have been the perfect time killer, and it is something I've wanted to do for a long time now.  There is a hilarious and charming film called  urlLink "The Cruise"  which is based on one of these tour bus drivers.  If you can find it, watch it, but keep an open mind (especially if you are male).  Also I met this guy before who worked for ESPN and he told me that the tour bus is a genuinely great thing to do if you've never been to NYC; so I figured it was time.  Earlier, while I was in the hotel lobby, ruminating on the possibilities ahead of me, I had slurped down several coffees and even some OJ. So, by the time I had driven my ass to Brooklyn, located a subway terminal, and rode the miles into Manhattan; I had to piss like a Power Ranger!  Luckily I arrived at this park, something like city hall park, I can't believe I forgot the name already. Well I tripped out there for a good while, munching this bagel I had to buy at Starbucks in order to use their stalls for the pissing.  After all this I began my intensive walking tour of Manhattan, which lasted far longer than I had intended.  I made it around the corner to some weird freedom monument fountain for veterans.  Here I was snapping some photos at the edge of the shadow of one of the sky scrapers, when bird shit fell  inches  from my foot, splattering on the bagel bag I had set on the ground to take the photos.  I looked above and saw only some birds at the very top of the building, a couple hundred feet above me.  This meant the shit must have been wavering side-to-side in the turbelence of the air before it finally landed from its terrible fall.  It very well could have been on a collision path with my uncovered head instead of the open sidewalk.  Anyways, I got a couple good pictures of this bum sitting in the fountain with his shoes off.  There was also an Asian guy near here too, who had his pants pulled up and was sunning his legs which were covered in horrible patches of some painfully-looking red skin disorder.  However, it looked very soothing there for the man to be soaking the sun up there in the carefree open morning; no one else was around except for the bum and I.  Obviously the 3 of us were of no consequence to each other, but I wussed out and took no picture of the Asian man. The birdshit episode, however, would turn out to be a augur for the upsetting and distraught set of fiascoes to come.  I wandered through the streets that morning into the World Trade Center grounds, Battery Park, and the Esplanade.  All of these scenes were appropriate for "Memorial Day" weekend, and it was pretty nifty to get these sights in before the crowds had really picked up.  Actually, to be completely accurate, I had drifted into China Town, Canal Street, and Wall Street that morning before making it to the Battery Park.  Once I reached the Battery Park, time started to flow faster, the crowds were increasing, and my black fleece jacket was becoming obsoleted by the high noon star.    I watched some street performers doing some flipping routines.  These are marginal performances compared to the Brazilian troupes I'd seen in Europe, or the musically integrated routines seen in Memphis by random groups of kids or even by the Beale Street Flippers.  I sat on a bench for almost an hour here, and smoked a cigarette.  The truth was that my nerves were actually beginning to work themselves up into some anxieties about meeting my friend.  I had an added constraint to escape NYC by around 2 or 3pm in order to reach Newport again by the late afternoon to make it to a party there.  At this point, in Battery park, on the bench, time was passing slowly and my second call to my buddy's cellphone went unanswered.    It turns out the double-deck bus tours cost $37, which is obviously uneconomical for someone who's planning to escape the city in just a couple hours.  I had to keep cruising on foot by myself.    The city had actually decided to make a small gift to me by pointing my shoes in the path to the Esplanade.  I had never really been aware of it before, and it was a pleasant surprise to say the least.  All of a sudden I had a couple miles of open sky, open Hudson River, and open park-path foliage paradises.  Wherever a major street terminates perpendicular to the Esplanade some kind of mini-temple shrine thing stands as an entranceway to the Esplanade.  Well, at least I saw a couple of these things, and when I accidentally stumbled onto it, it was by passing through one of them cool entrances.  There is actually an  urlLink official website  I found here about this area.  I really enjoyed them intersecting areas between the "big city" and the waterfront.  Towards the north end there were more green spaces for suntanners and such, some basketball courts and playgrounds, and even an empty volleyball court.  One thing I noticed, nearly every jogger, roller-blader, aggressive walker, sun bather, parent-taking-their-childrens-to-play-in-sun, loiterers with sketchpads, and picnic troopers were females.  For a second I thought about this, then stopped, because I realised it doesn't matter. (my thought was that most women in NYC perhaps live healthier lifestyles than most men)  I could go on about the Esplanade for much longer, but instead I'll push forward.  At about 1pm I had walked the length of the Esplanade twice, and had reached the beginning.  I unsuccessfully called my friend for a 3rd time.  At this point I was disgusted with him and had decided I would begin my escape act.  Since I had bought the unlimited subway card, and since I only had $3 cash, I decided to first jump to somewhere cool in another area of Manhattan where I could grab some ATM money for lunch and for the tolls on the way home.  This proved to be my undoing.  I ended up exiting the subway close to Canal street.  I quickly left Canal and made a fruitless route around the block, which took me back onto Canal street just a few blocks east of where I had deserted it.  I cannot believe how I managed to go so long without spotting an ATM.  When I was nearing Soho, I think, I kind of gave up on the idea.  Now my goal was just to leave NYC and stop at some gas station maybe around JFK area on my way back.  But it was at this point when the sun began to really glare most maliciously down onto my black fleece jacket.  I was overdue to come off the streets, and my fluids were gone.    However, my new position on Canal was terribly out of kilter.  If you don't realize, Canal cuts through China Town.  And I mentioned earlier that I came through here in the morning, which was a bit fun and interesting.  The afternoon had transformed this area into a madness I was wholly unprepared for.  The throngs of tourists were in full effect. The street merchants and herds of bargain seekers brought the sidewalk traffic to a standstill in most places.  My pockets were full of junk so I had to beware of theft in this close confines.  This meant keeping my hands close to my side and in reach of my digital camera, cell phone, wallet, etc - therefore, more heat trapped inside my coat.  My stress levels were rising fast.  Once I got close to the exact subway I had last exited, I made an important discovery.  My cell phone, which I had been holding in the crowds, had a missed call and voicemail!  Some insane twist of fate had sent me a message from my friend in Brooklyn, without causing my phone to actually ring.  I called him without checking the message and made arrnagements to meet at a station in Brooklyn.  All I had to do was find this blue "C" station here on Canal Street.  I started by going back in the shitty direction I had come from on Canal, back east again.  After a while I realized I had gone too far, so I turned and walked through the fringe once again.  Soon I was fully distraught and called my friend again.  This kind of episode repeats rather endlessly in my memory now; I simply remember walking back and forth across Canal more than 5 or 6 times.  I remember walking it while on the phone with my friend, I remember walking it and running into a scene of a gang of Africans being subdued by some large undercover policemen and waiting for the crowd to wait for an arriving police van to crash into the sidewalk and haul the group of thieves away.  I remember the merchants scrambling to conceal their illegal wares.  I remember the black man relating to his friend next to me how foolish it is to walk down the street talking on a cell phone, of course whilst trying to find the phantom subway entrance while my friend on the other side of the phone was trying to scour up some landmarks on the map to help me get the hell out of this maelstrom of capital collision.  I also remember some teenage girls at the end of Canal street, where I was giving up on the possibility of finding the subway, cackling to each other about how exciting and perfect the day was going to be upon their arrival to this China Town district.  Needless to say, I felt like a sick animal juxtaposed with these happy-go-lucky specimens.  I wasn't much different from them that morning though, I can't believe what happened to me!  I remember one of the skinny African men flying past me at a sprint, right down the outer lane of the street off the sidewalk, carrying a brief case of someone's goods (maybe he was just protecting his own from the police or maybe he was one of the thieves, who knows).  Oh, how I wanted to flee the place at that same emergency clip!  But tourists aren't allowed to panic; stay calm, buy some shit, talk to the merchant, and let them give you gibberish directions while the hooligans pick your pockets.  Or hire a taxi.  Eventually I settled on the original subway station I had taken into this hell district, and made the amazingly simple transfers necessary to meet my friend in Brooklyn.  My reasoning faculties were shot at this point, so I didn't even feel bad about not having the clairvoyance to make this decision earlier, before being consumed by the overstressing repetition of those unsavory throngs.  Hell, I might have easily left out some things there. A simple narrative regurgitation of the events does not do it justice; it was a non-linear distortion of reality, in which I really felt like I was in a part of some dream.  This is especially true since I remember the bits and pieces just like the fragments of a dream.  I think only just now upon writing this that I might have actually stumbled upon the NYC as it really must be, in this abstract fashion that defies tour books and magazine write-ups, for surely as the inaccessible Statue of Liberty stands like a broken memory of some America that has indeed passed.  &lt;rant&gt;(no one is allowed inside the Statue anymore, which, in my opinion, signifies a terrible malady with the state of this country we're living in &ndash; obviously there is a disease that those in power are at the moment unable to understand or confront realistically, so therefore her majesty is off-limits&hellip; oh, and there's scores of helicopters patrolling the waters there like it's some kind of derelict prison state now)&lt;/rant&gt;  At any rate, I finally met my buddy and we got some lunch.  It was a tremendous relief to finally give up the responsibility of finding my way around for this bit of time, and to gather a little sympathy and awe from my friend for the events which had befallen me up to this point.  It really had all begun on my first call to my friend at 8am, when my call had caused his phone to vibrate off his nightstand onto the ground, which duly dislodged the battery.  This is why I was unable to contact to him until so late in the afternoon (relatively late for someone who had been wandering aimlessly for six hours).  By the time we had eaten lunch it was time for him to go to work.  Our short meeting was pleasant, but I definitely still had a bitter enough taste in mouth to know that I had to escape NYC by whatever means possible.  At the current rate of calamities and strange mishaps, I knew that any supplemental diversions could prove disasterous.  I had memorized the location of my car relative to the subway station, so I was able to get back to this place (intersection of Brooklyn Ave. &  Farragut Ave.).  However, my memory had confused the orientation of this spot relative to North/South coordinates of the Sunbelt expressway I needed in order to return home.  When I reached the intersection I had an image in mind of the house I left my car in front of. There happened to be a very similar looking house at the nearest corner, which is where I believed my car would be.  For a short minute I began to panic, thinking that it was either towed away or stolen.  Even though I found my car around the corner, I was now thoroughly confused once again.  But I had my road atlas, and my last wit's end, so I was still hopeful.    To sum things up a bit quickly, I started going back north towards Manhattan, where all the pile-ups of traffic start taking over!  I ended up going further southwest than planned, but I at least avoided the stress-inducing traffic congestion, and made it to the Sunbelt.  This took me back towards the Interstate and JFK expressway, which was the eventual pathway to I-95 back to Connecticut and Rhode Island.  NYC would not let me go from its claws so easily though. I ended up going past the JFK expressway because there was no exit leading north.  Everything just said basically "this way to the airport", which was south.  I turned around and tried to go ever so carefully so as not to make any more mistakes.  The fates of this damned city were plotting against me, obviously, as they now led me into magnetic fields of JFK &ndash; verily, I was sucked south into the terminal entrances.  At this point I began to lose control of my anger, as before I had internalized it all and kept it bottled away in public, and now I was safely in the private confines of my car.  Hence, I was able to vent some frustrations and start yelling and screaming and pounding my fist on the steering wheel.  Of course, there is no quick exit from this airport, I had to drive the entire length into the front steps before reaching an exit path.  Certainly this was the most frustrating episode of the driving components of my long venture.  I can't say anything more about my journey, the narrative ends here basically.  I made it out alive and without bodily or material incident.  It was really all just psychological damage and stress levels that plagued me.  But I don't want to analyze anything further with this story.  It is just how I would like to leave it, as a series of uninformed decisions about navigating NYC that kind of happened at my control, but mostly out of control, at random.    To add the last detail, I raced back to Newport and made it minutes before they closed the liquor stores (10pm, damn Puritan Yanks!).  And after a 3-minute shower and 2 very quick beers, I was off to this party I had planned to make it to by 8pm, praying some stragglers would be left and that not everyone had deserted it for the nearby watering holes&hellip; and my prayers were successively answered one by one&hellip; it was in all categories, a classic night to party in Newport, admittedly!  Such a perfect beer-commercial ending to a night of hanging with new and interesting people was only partly true, however.  On my way home a car of black men ended up next to me on the road.  One of them asks me amicably, "having a good night?"  I says, "yeahhh man!"  And in response, just before peeling off at the light he replies, "you're fucking gay!!!"  It just so happens that a few minutes earlier I was talking to people about my origins with Atlanta and Memphis, some of the existing racial problems that I was so happy to have abandoned up here in Rhode Island, and my overall malaise and specific anxiety with the subject.    But you know what, I guess I'm the racist to think that they were racist for calling me gay for no reason.  So, the grand moral of this story is the following:    roll with the punches  take the peaks with the valleys  chew the meat and spit out the bones

       UPDATE: check out that AWESOME new Griz Logo!    I am sick of the Goddamn Lakers.  First of all, if God was paying attention right now to the NBA, He would not allow them to win, through His Almighty Wisdom.  What wisdom?  Well because the Lakers are called the Lakers because they were a bunch of losers from Minnesota at first.  Now they are playing the new Minnesota Losers (Timeberwolves).     Clearly these new losers should be defeating the worse-than-losers-because-we-sold-out-and-moved-to-california-to-be-millionaires-and-have-sex-with-movie-stars-and-drug-fiend-Hollywood-celebrities- L.A. Lakers.  God should be against things like this.  So - since God apparently has better things to do than worry about the Goddamn NBA - I have decided of course to take the matter in my own hands, because I am so righteous.    urlLink    I plan to join the Grizzlies in 2005, tentatively, unless I get an offer from the Timberwolves to backup my man, Latrell. (That would be easier than taking entire yoke as the starter for the Grizzlies, which I admit will be a tough gig through 90-something games when We win the Championship).     urlLink      Magic Bear ==  Good  &#176; Osama ==  Bad

           For years this symbol bothered the hell out of me.  Whenever I asked people about it, they had no explanation!  I'm not kidding.  No one could ever tell me for sure what it was.  I had seen it a few times in this gay neighborhood in Chicago as well as Atlanta.  You would think I could have concluded its meaning then, but after seeing it alongside a popular fraternity sticker on some BMW at school and since this car with the frat image did not appear to be the type to advertise controversial points of view (or to advertise normal points of view through symbols which apparently are closely associated with homosexuals --- I think that is a fair assessment), well I was confused then.  And I swear I've seen it on other  affluent/wealthy  persons' cars... which encouraged my  secret society  suspicion.  Anyways, I felt some great relief at finding out this knowledge today that it indeed stands for equal rights to homos and trannies.  I kind of suspected that it was some crazy secret society, since no one would tell me what it was!  Now I know it's just kind of obscure but carries a deliberate meaning.   And you know, well, it is just kind of sucky to think everyone is in some secret society you don't know about, but however, I guess that would explain a lot of things about the society in general... at least in this reporter's eyes (if there was this secret, pervasive counterculture society running under our noses).  Of course if there was such a thing I would want to be a part of it immediately.  Whatever!

        Somehow I lost track of time, but the  urlLink Grand Challenge results  are fresh news for me.    I have some personal interest in the Red Team not only cause my company helped pay for it and donated equipment, but also cause it was driven by those nuts at CMU.    I don't really agree with the terms of the competition though.  It is still trying to fulfill that old stupid dream of  urlLink GOFAI  (good old fashioned AI).  I mean, I don't care if my car drives itself 100% in 10 years.  I would rather it be able to drive itself 95% of the time tomorrow, which is achievable today.  But this is assuming that we aren't afraid to embrace this human-computer symbiosis, and instead continue to divide humanity in grotesque ways between personal and impersonal interfaces (externalized, embodied intelligence versus a social, distributed cognitive intelligence).   It also assumes that the holy grail is not achievable in 10 years... so for 35 years it has not been... and so why not introduce HUMAN intelligence (eh,  in situ  you goons) into the mix?  The everyday computer user's intelligence far exceeds performance of the best GOFAI (in most domains).  We should be bridging these intelligences as well as decomposing and engineering them from scratch.  Research dominates the one end of the spectrum however...  I'll just get back to work now and stop being contrary.  Your PC sucks!   urlLink More about Red Team

        urlLink     This is pretty interesting tutorial:  urlLink lipsync tutorial .  What I really enjoyed were the comments in the end about languages and cultural evolution, particularly the part about the media interfaces supplanting the village lifestyle.    Just skip down to the bottom if you are in a rush and want to read the author's little manifesto.  I can imagine all these ideas swirling through his head at 5am after several long nights of coding up this tutorial of  lipsync.  Humm!

      Everyone knows taxes are a bitch.  Today I received my first paycheck with a little raise.  I never realized how shitty taxes are until now.  The more you make, the more they shall tax you.   This is not a linear relationship though; must realize the graduated tax model here in the society.  Yes, you get more money with a raise, but no, it is not proportional to your old salary.  This is sad and makes your head hurt, I know.    Plain and simple terms: 10% more income means maybe 8% actually increased paycheck.

       Some dudes next door accosted me about my TN license plate when I was heading off to work this morning.  One of them claimed to have all these relatives there and that he even once lived in the surrounding area.  Well the conversation ended when he started asking me about  Movie Mountain .   I really don't know what the hell it is.  Mapquest reveals a  urlLink Movie Mountain, TX , which doesn't even have a major road in its vicinity.  My first guess is Google's first result for the Movie Mountain adult film store.  Yeah, there's lots of those in Tennessee.  Just stop by Bucksnort sometime.

        urlLink Daily Texan Online article    Here is a quote from the article I find amusing:  The officer also noticed a handwritten note resting on top of the body, which read, "Computer chip in brain."    Your first American instinct from such a story is to reside on the xenophobia, and point to the foreign-terrorist-sounding name of the killer, and excuse the killing as some foreigners' doing and not one of our own.  Ok, maybe that has some truth in this case.   The student was from Hawaii. Hawaii definitely has something against Texas.  Have you ever seen the Aloha Bowl?  For some reason a university from Texas plays football there every year it seems.  And there is always a fight.  My favorite image from this past season of NCAA bowl insanity was that of a stereotypically obese Samoan woman smacking an adolescent Longhorn male off his rocker, blindsiding him down the stands.    This melee is just the beginning.  Has Hawaii forgotten the Whitehouse is Texan?

If you dig through that first page you'll find the package to download and that can be installed manually in squeak through the  File Browser .  Or you can go in squeak and look for this thing called the  urlLink Package Loader , and install FractalMorph package over the web all at once.  Here are more instructions.  If you find yourself running Squeak, to get to this Package Loader do the following.  Click somewhere in the "World" on the desktop area so that a menu pops up, which is called the  World Menu .  From this goto "open" and then you will have "Package Loader as a choice, ( WorldMenu -> open -> PackageLoader ).  Once the PackageLoader loads itself, you should have an alphabetic listing of packages.  If you dont see FractalMorph in the listing then you can right-click and you should see some filters, probably one of these filters is on which is preventing the FractalMorph package from being shown.  When you see  FractalMorph  package in the list you can right-click on it and get a menu that has download and install.  There's no reason to download, so just install it, and you will have a FractalMorph open automatically when it completes.

          It's obvious these days that everything of any value to  The Man  is becoming a computation.  This means your physical life will increasingly develop into new and further entrenched channels of your digital life, as this information age of ours progresses.  The picture above is from a company that offers a new tool for livestock producers to better track each and every animal.  It is important for them to have accurate tracking when there are outbreaks like mad cow disease, and to know the pedigrees of your different prize beasts and their progeny.  It comes down to storing and analyzing biometrics.  The biometrics game is centuries old, and examples are even found in the stories and legends of ancient cultures (think about  urlLink Quetzalcoatl , basically this god's distinction is a primitive biometric: fair colored skin and hair).  So yeah, we have a history of trying to encode life into things like DNA (amazingly there  really is  this  holy grail  code to life - that we discovered this past century!), so simple applications like monitoring the geneology of livestock could potentially unlock greater fundamental codes into a purer "essence" of life.  Of course, that is the job of our modern physicists/mathematicians (if you noticed,  urlLink DNA hasn't made us the "super-race" quite yet&hellip; ), but if you were a cattle rancher in Greeley, Colorado (the home of this livestock retinal scanner company), wouldn't you want to get your hands on the code if you could?  Hell, it sounds like a good sci-fi movie plot: cattle rancher unlocks genesis code to breed new Super-Saiyan Bovine of the Holy Tabernacle.  Anyways, at least it is a dream that farmers can ruminate on for a good while, a dream which admittedly rivals the loftiest dreams of the mega-elite, intellectual, ivory tower thinkers&hellip; damn those ivory tower people!  I bet they are afraid of retinal scanners too.    Really I just want retinal scanners and biometrics so I can stop having to use the same silly passwords for the computer.  Passwords, mothers' maiden names, your SSN, and the name of your first stuffed animal are just no match for Herr Doctor's Double Helix!   urlLink OPTIBRAND

         I give this movie a thumbs-down!  I should have known after, however many years ago it was, having accidentally stumbled upon Sofia Copolla's previous debauchery,  urlLink The Virgin Suicides . Well, I guess that's why I waited about a year after its release before finally watching  Lost In Translation . The soundtrack from both films is impeccable, but both stories fail to affect me.  There is something sinister beneath these films that really irks me.  I can't figure it out and don't really want to. (yet I'll keep going on anyway) They are so close to being something that I would embrace and rave over.  Maybe since they are so close to making some kind of deeply felt connection, it seems I have been let-down by the film makers for teasing me, almost giving me a masterpiece, but failing.  And why should we spend our time on something that failed?  As I said though, the music is good and, similarly, you can bite off little chunks from each film that make them almost worthwhile: of cinematography, of tone, and perhaps from delectable scenes such as the  urlLink "Matthew's Best Hit TV"  appearance.  But as a whole the film is a zero star flop.  The dreamy opiate death lull and malaise encapsulating these films does make me sick.  And I feel supremely jealous of these undeserving, dufus Americans slowly coming to realize how hip Japan can be. It is quite frustrating to think of the opportunities people have and take for granted. I can't identify with teenage girls who mope around the house by themselves all day, or self-centered American adults who travel across the world to sit in their hotel lobby until they can find someone as equally distraught as themselves.  Maybe this is my mistake and part of my own personal issues &ndash; but I have only found that if you wait for anyone or anything you're waiting for disappointment. Let's keep moving!    ZERO STARS
