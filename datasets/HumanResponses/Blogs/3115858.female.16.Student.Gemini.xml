      i sent a letter to japan today.  i hope that Eri, my pen pal, decides to continue corresponding with me.  she has no clue how much fun it is for me to receive letters from -nippon-:)  the cool thing is, one of my friends might go to japan and live in her town for a while.  that would be interesting.B  KICHIGAI KAWAII!  thursday is my korean friend's birthday.  i hope i have some pics from florida for her...  i don't remember my dream from last night.  but it must've been bad, cos i was not really able to get out of bed.  but i still got to jazz band on time.  but i sat on gum sometime between getting on the bus and sitting on a chair in the band room.  grrrrr...  i hate the bus.  i will never ride it to school   AGAIN  .  i think it's time to pick up the guitar again and start writing some songs.

      i had another really bad dream last night.  this one was only with my mom and me.  we were in a pink cadillac (mom driving), driving in a rather hilly area of the state (i'm thinking maybe at devil's lake state park).  for some reason, we were driving on top of the rocky hill, and she turned toward a cliff.  she slowly accelerated to a somewhat safe (from what i felt) part of the cliff and stopped about 15 yards from the very edge of the cliff.  the cliff was sort of narrow, especially about 5 yards away, where half of the cliff had disappeared at some point.   i was still relatively calm. then, she put her foot back on the accelerator and  very slowly  drove closer to that first edge of the cliff.  i grew increasingly uncomfortable, and repeatedly told her to stop.  she kept driving, and i was scared shitless.  i started screaming at her more.  it seemed like it took forever to drive across that small part of the cliff.   she kept driving .  i kept screaming.  finally, the car tipped off the side of the cliff, and we plummeted to the lake below.  during the fall, i closed my eyes, screamed my ass off, and hoped i wouldn't die.   i thought it was real.  it seemed real.   i think it symbolizes what my mom has been doing to me lately...she (however unintended) has been ruining my life...my self-worth, my social life (i think i'm losing all of my friends), my ability to complete normal tasks (waking up, being on-time)... these dreams scare the hell out of me.  i want them to stop. so many things are bothering me.  i'm becoming restless, irritable, and even more angry.   over what?   i talked to out-of-town boy after state solo/ensemble (more later).  at one point, he actually chastised me for what happened while he was here.  here is that part of the convo(after i apologized for not calling him for 2 weeks): him:yeah...your family seems to have some communication problems. me:i know.  it's been like this for a long time.  i'm trying my best... him:hmmm....yeah.  your mom....  you shouldn't have done that.  that fight  made me feel really  uncomfortable  . me:i'm sorry.  it's really hard to control...i never know what she's going to do.   him:yeah, but... me:seriously...if i ignore her, she gets in my face even more.  she gets angrier.  please understand me.  i can't really do much about it.  she doesn't care what everyone else thinks.  what he said really bothers me.   like i could control that . that made him seem really insensitive.  like a major ass.  that made me not want to talk to him.  i'm not sure if i like him anymore.  he showed some traits during that phone call that i'm not too sure about...you know.  solo/ensemble:  i was eating  horrible  uwm student union sushi, when a friend that i hadn't seen for a while walked up and said "hi, genna" in his cutesy little boyish way.  my heart sank, and i got up and hugged him.  he sat down, and we talked.  (he was there for his girlfriend, but felt like talking to me!  whoa.)  i think everyone i know (me included) has  at least  a -tiny- little crush on him.  i'm pretty sure.  i guess what happened the other night doesn't mean anything.  he was just busy.:))))))))  that's the only thing that has made me feel relatively good in the past few days.:*} well, and my friends' birthday parties yesterday...

      i had another bad dream.  bad, bad dream.  the dream begins with me and some friends on a high ledge.  The ledge was not connected to any other form of land (round, stand alone sort of), and i don't remember how we got there.  I think we were there doing an experiment of some sort or a field trip...maybe. some of the people in my dream are not closely associated to me, and i am confused as to why they were part of it.  in the dream, it was like we were all best friends.  one, an ex-boyfriend, is from out-of-town.  my best friend is also there.  we (us 3) are the main characters.   so, we're on the cliff, and i had chosen to stay in the middle, being afraid of high cliffs and sharp drops.  my ex boyfriend is standing by a  guard rail  (?on a deserted cliff?) and looking out into the horizon.  i shake with fear.  i stand up, wanting to maybe get over my fear, and everyone instantly comes over to me and grabs me and pushes me toward the guard rail.  (everyone except my best friend)  i'm shaking, crying, screaming...terrified of what my  friends  would do to me.  my best friend was standing in a clear area of the cliff, watching this happen.   the others managed to position me so that my legs were dangling off the cliff, and i am hanging on to the bottom rung of the guard rail.  i am so afraid, like nothing i ever felt before.  they clear away, and my ex leaves the guard rail, too.  they watch me like i am a circus animal.  after a while, my best friend comes over and drags me from my place on the cliff.  i lay in the middle gasping, hyperventilating, almost choking on my own tears.  then i blacked out.  the dream came clear again, and at this point, i am sitting in that place(legs dangling), somewhat at peace but quite nervous.  my bari sax-playing friend came up behind me and starts beating the hell out of me.  then she pushes me off the cliff.  i woke up, eyes wide and breathing heavily.  i think this is some sort of precursor to what is going to happen between me and someone (maybe even her) close to her.  i'm scared.  nervous off my ass.  this is making me crazy.  i hate (     ).

      that's not the only dream that i've had like that.  i've had a lot of trouble sleeping lately, and they are definitely a result of happenings as-of-late...and maybe even the cause of less sleep.  (aftermath-ish thingy.)  i'm wearing the same shirt that out-of-town boy wore on friday.  and the only other person i know who has this shirt wore it today too.  (it's a radiohead shirt.)  i think this and my dreams are signs of what will happen to me in the near future.  i don't like it.  (i don't know what the latter signifies, but maybe it's an opposite of personality or something like that.)  :/  i think i'm going to quit music, too.  at least after i'm finished with high school.  i might keep my guitar around, but as for french horn, i think graduation is it.  when will i use it after that?  there is no way in hell that i would be able to make it in the world as a horn player.  i'm not very good at it, and it's good that i'm realizing it so that i can spend my time on other things.  i have no desire to continue my education on french horn.  i'm not capable of much else on that, as far as i can see.  you might call it "giving up."  i call it prioritizing.  for once. it's what my parents have always wanted me to do.  i hope they're happy.  they're the only people (between the three of us) that get anything close to what they want.  i'm struggling to survive.  literally.  i'm being strangled.

      oh.  when i was with out-of-town boy the other day(in the music store downtown), we encountered the minister from the episcopal church.  he is a very nice and  inquisitive  person.  here is the conversation (somewhat paraphrased):  me:  Hi, Father Sam! FS:  Well, hello there!  How are you? me:  wonderful, thank you.  How are you? FS:  getting better.  i just had surgery on my eye.  i had a detached retina. (i already knew that; i was at his church and heard about it the day after it happened) me:  oh, yes.  i heard about that.  i'm glad to hear that you're getting better. FS:  thank you.  (out-of-town boy appears from behind a rack of musical accessories) WHO IS THIS? me:  this is (name).  he's a friend of mine. FS:  (nudges me with his elbow)  Friends?  are you sure about that?  from that point, the conversation went on like that...him trying to squeeze the words "he is my boyfriend"  out of me.  which isn't true...yet.  and then he went on to ask out-of-town boy about where he's from, what he does, etc.    very uncomfortable.  (!)

      creepy people everywhere.  i just came back from school (where i was retrieving my french horn for a youth symphony rehearsal tonight).  i was walking down an adjacent street from my house, when a creepy dude pulled up next to me and asked me if i wanted to do a paper route.  wanting -any kind- of money, i said yes.  i am probably really stupid for doing that.  why was i walking to and from school?  i hate youth symphony!  i wish i could just quit.

      fuck.  i'm grounded just because my mom isn't a good communicator.  just because she can't say the  important  things.  just because she is a selective listener.  grrrrr.  at least i got to hang with out-of-town boy.:)

      i received a phone call from my japanese friend about 2 things: 1.  having to go to chicago (not wanting to)--she has to go with her host mom & brother and her brother's friend and her mom.  she will have no one to talk to--and worst of all, they are running down for the day to find DANCE SHOES!  they're nuts.  i feel really bad for her.  she is not looking forward to that trip. 2.  our friend (remaining nameless, of course) just broke up with his girlfriend today.  he is sad, and my japanese friend worries about him.  she doesn't know, however, why our friends broke up. (i'm pretty sure that i do.)  i think that they broke up because the guy is very concerned about our little japanese friend and wants to hang out with her.  the girl thinks that the little japanese one is a threat to her status as his girlfriend.  not the case.  they are merely friends wanting to spend some time together before our japanese friend leaves at the end of june. not much time left.:'(  i'm still really bummed about the get-together at the track meet.  but i've realized that i think the same of him now as i did when i first met him: booo--rrinngggg!  he doesn't even know what mystery science theater 3000 is!!!!!! aaaaaaaa!!!  muy mal. tomorrow will be much better.  my best friend and a potential significant other--the three of us out for coffee.  yay:]

      i just met with a person who i used to be really good friends with.  i now find that he is a very boring person.  i wish things were like they used to be...i don't know what happened.  he's being sort of stupid and selfish, and it's frustrating to be around someone who doesn't talk (except with his moron friends).  i now know why i wasn't so excited about our get-together.  tomorrow will be better.  out-of-town boy and i will hang out.  hopefully ALL DAY!  i really want that to be the case.  no more stalking!  i wish i wasn't stupid.  i hate myself.

      i'm really scared and worried now because i've scared (i mean, really scared) a friend of mine...indirectly.  he doesn't know it's me, and i don't want him to know who it is.  i anonymously went on his music site's messageboard and spilled my guts out to him.  i have everyone really freaked out, and now i'm getting really nervous.  i'm finding myself unable to talk to him, even just online.  i'm afraid that i'll slip.  it's strange to be a stalker AND to have a stalker at the same time.  an exchange student boy from south korea walks me home every day and meets me at my locker and follows me around all the time.  it's freaky.  and uncomfortable.  i want him to stop.  and i have realized that i have to stop.  maybe this exchange student boy thingy (codename: mission surfboard) is meand to open my eyes to what i am doing to one of my own friends.  i am a sick person.  this is my first full day back at home after a few days in florida for a school trip...and i hate it here.  i managed my freedom (which i had a lot of!) very well, and i think i deserve some kind of perk for that.  not that i would do it any other way on any other occasion... i guess i don't have to say anything more than that the trip to  disneyworld  was nothing less than blissful.  being at disney with some of my best friends is just what i needed...except that i need more of it.  i'm so burned out right now.  there is this nice guy from out of town who i would love to hang out with...hopefully to hook up with sometime soon.  i think he is probably the best person who has come around me in a long time...we're just like each other.  it's strange and beautiful at the same time.  i'm going to call him.  now.

      it wasn't sasser.  something else, but we don't know.  at least i don't have to use crappy, slow library computers anymore.  compy is fixed--it took the dude 4 HOURS of precious time to clean this monster up.  i felt so bad for the guy.  he didn't want food or something to drink or anything...just kept chuggin along with this thing.  amazing.  woot!  I LIKE AMBUHGUHS AND WOOT BEEA!  hamburger haus is hopefully on the slate for saturday.  :))))))))))  i think most of my friends have forgotten that it is my birthday on saturday.  oh well.  okay, so it's a little disappointing.  i don't forget their birthdays...but one can't expect reciprocation from a friend.  i don't really mention my birthday to anyone...i mean, what is it really worth?  a few more rights?  a few gifts from those who choose to remember?  queen/king for the day?  (not yet...)  anyway, it's not like it matters to anyone whether or not some obscure weirdo gives him/her a small gift...or takes him/her out to dinner...etc.  whatever.  i'm trying not to feel sorry for myself.  at least i have the peace of mind that i am a decent friend.  (a little egotistical at this point)

      urrrgghhhhh... the virus scanner on my home computer must not have detected that it had the sasser virus, because now the system has gone to hell and i have to use the ultra-slow public library computers.  it blows.  big time.  my sister was the last one to have used it--last friday night, while i was not at home.  i'm trying not to blame it on her.  oh...last friday.  i was wearing my radiohead shirt (favorite!) and this really poseur-ish (thinks she's) popular girl (in my history class) said, "oh, genna, i love your shirt.  i   have   to have it! it's the coolest shirt.  where did you get it???????????"  j/k, lol, lmao, rotfl!!!  yes, she is the epitome of the valley girl mentality.  yuck.  what's even worse, she wants my effing shirt, but doesn't have the slightest clue as to what it means.  she probably has never heard of radiohead, except if i have happened to mention "radiohead" loud enough for her gossip-spongy ears to hear.  GAWD!  at least the only other people (2 guys i know--one is out-of-town boy) who have this shirt knows what it really means.  KOMPEWTURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  yeah.  my birthday is on saturday.  only my best friend will be around.  nobody else.  not j-pop girl, not koreastar...nobody.  i'm gonna have a wonderful day, with nobody around.   yep .  i don't feel like calling out-of-town boy.  he's an ass.

      i'm getting really worried.  almost two weeks ago, my korean girl friend stopped talking (all of a sudden) to my japanese friend, and it's been really uncomfortable for our little group of 4 friends (me, korean, japanese, and wannabejapanese boy).  i've been trying to facilitate a conversation between the two girls, but in the process of trying to figure out the real problem (of the korean, that is), i had offended her.  and now she's not talking to me, either.  she doesn't talk to anyone except the korean boy.  it's sad.  i hate that.  i wish i could make it better, and that she would realize that people don't know what you don't tell them...most of the time.  she's of the anal-retentive sort, i suppose, and she's beginning to become difficult to deal with.  she's become really mean and feisty, not knowing that she has offended me (along with the other two in our little group-ish thing) countless times before this point.  it's just that we don't care.  and it's okay that she does, but she needs to forget it.  finally.  she doesn't get it.  i don't know what i'm going to do.  nobody else does, either.  :/

      damn, this (blogger) is pretty cool now...  anyway, i just scored a ton of vinyls at garage sales and (of all places) my gramma's house.  i'm pretty happy about that!  i cut another inch off of my hair...i like it  much  better.  last night, a friend (that i haven't known for very long) called me up twice.  once to have a prom-loser (not cool enough to go to prom) convo, and the other to freak out about a deja-vu situation stemming from something mentioned in the past convo.  it was funny.  and cool.  and he called up during the r.e.m. concert on tv (:D).  we both like them.  funny.  i talked to a different friend the night after i cut my hair off, and he made me super happy.  so happy that i could almost NOT sleep, and that i woke up with a smile on my face.  i dreamt about him (again) that night.  this time, it was pleasant. i hope he can come to the everclear concert.  he just got a new job, and he might be trapped with that.  we'll see.  my korean girl friend won't talk to my little japanese girl friend anymore.  and it's really strange as to why.  it really bothers me.  i want it to stop.   very soon .  it doesn't make sense at all.  none of it does.  huuzzzzaaaahh!

      i forgot to say this yesterday.  sunday was a terrible day.  i was bored off my ass, and my family was not being very nice to me.  i was extremely depressed.  i wanted to have some fun that evening (with or without friends) in sheboygan, watching an impromptu theatre show.  my mom was too bitchy to let me enjoy myself.  we argued, and she told me to go to my room.  i went to my room.  that is, only to get my pair of chuck taylors and crocheted hat so i could walk to my best friend's place of work in the rain.  i quietly slipped out of the sliding door in the basement, and walked to that restaurant opposite of any way that a family could see me.  i sat at the restaurant for an hour and a half, and then my best friend took me over to her house for two and a half hours (or so) to watch a movie that she'd just received for her birthday.  i wanted to walk home, but they wouldn't let me.  so they took me home at quarter after ten that night, and i hid behind the bushes until they left.  then, i ran around almost every side of the house, tried every door that was out of sight of my family, and checked to see where my mom was.  she was in the kitchen reading papers, so i ran around to the sliding door again and started to slide it open.  i peeked in, and the basement was empty and dark.  so i went in, closed the door, tore off my shoes, picked them up, ran into my room and quietly shut the door.  i placed the wet shoes in some shoe cubby holes, and quickly undressed and got into my pajamas.  i quickly ran to the bathroom and brushed my teeth, and ran back to my room and threw myself onto my bed.  i looked around the dark room and noticed that it went untouched.   nobody checked to see if i was okay.  nobody gave a rat's ass at all about me.  my family spent that four hours so wrapped up in themselves that they would not have cared if i was dead or alive, at that moment.  it was an unsettling thought.  they are the most selfish people i know.  they should take a look in the mirror before they start calling me names.  they still don't know about it.

      this has been such a depressing week.  i miss Michiko (okay, i'm using her name finally) like she died or something.  even though i just talked to her on the phone yesterday.  i guess she's on her plane, now--and i guess she's getting back to Japan at about 4 in the afternoon, our time.  that's her picture, above this.  i can't stand to look at her picture--it makes me feel worse.  when i saw her last, i held her hand for what must've been 5 minutes, because i knew i wouldn't be in her presence for a very, very long time.  being around good friends doesn't help, because my bestbest friend (NOT a typo) hasn't been around for the past week--and she'd really be able to help me.  i need her right now.  maybe tomorrow.  oooh, it's so sweet!  the korean boy misses me, and he says that every time he sends an e-mail or talks to me on msn.  he says that i'm his best american friend.  aaaawww...:}  driver's ed bites the big donk.  i hate it.  3 more days of hell left...and then i have to drive in the morning.  :(  driver's ed is the devil.  now i can't see medeski martin & wood in milwaukee because of this stupid party that the rest of my family is going to.  i'm really pissed, because it's my  one  good jazz show all year.  PISSED!  i can't hang out with my drummer friend either.  -__-  this week is gonna suck.  exactly ONE week until my korean girl friend leaves.  i'm going to be ultra sad, then.  i hope i don't do anything stupid.

      wow, i haven't blogged in over a week!!!!  not good.  i have so much to say.  anyway, the everclear concert was AWESOME!!!  i had a great time, and i made my korean girl friend into an everclear fan.  =))))  the new guys are super nice, and extremely competent replacements.  i enjoyed hanging out with them after the show (oh yeah, backstage for the 3rd time in a row!) my 2 korean friends came with me.  we had fun (i think).  yeah.  i was really bored last week.  REALLY bored. i went to my friend's birthday party, and had to leave in the middle of it because of requiem practice.  it was fun, i thought, but japanese girl and wannabe pulled it again.  wannabe apologized this time.  how thoughtful!  tonight is japanese girl's party.  it's going to be REALLY sad.  and then i have to leave in the middle of that, too-- shebaghdad choral society performs -Faure's Requiem- tonight.  -__-;;  korean boy left on thursday morning.  well, for chicago.  i think he's on the plane right now.  EEK!  i couldn't finish his going away gift on time.  :(  i feel really bad.  that's all for now.  WAIT!  i saw *someone* yesterday (cute pothead boy)--and he didn't recognize me at first!  HAHA!  i wanted to ____ him, but he was at work.  fill in the blank for that one.;)  okaybye.

      things aren't looking up for the concert.  maybe i will just go with korean boy.  we haven't done anything together yet, anyway.  and he's going back to korea for the summer in a week.  it's about time that we do something together.

      somebody read my blog!  :]  yeah.  i'm going to a concert on saturday.  my favorite band.  it should be quite and exquisite bash!  i'm really excited, and sad--it might be the last time that i see a few of my friends.  ;[  friends whom aren't from around here.  one is moving to north carolina...and the others are going off to college in their respective states.  i'm going to be really sad!  now, i've gotta find someone to go with me.  it's not proving to be an easy task.  it's making me really sad--cos all of my friends are bailing out on me...one has a wedding to go to with "icky boy," the other is going to grad parties with her "boyfriend" (...), another is going to parties, and another yet is going to parties.  these are the original people that i asked--3 weeks ago.  i wasn't disappointed after the first one forgot, but the next three don't tell me anything about their plans.  i assumed that they were still going.  but when i asked them again tonight, they (nonchalantly grinning) immediately muttered their plans.  i felt like i'd fallen off a cliff.  that's after i met a friend of mine after he was done with his first play practice thingy for a theatre company to which i used to belong.  i hadn't seen him in a month, and he really freaked out when he saw me.  priceless moment. oh yeah...and the little japanese girl was supposed to be coming along.  but she's on a trip this week, and then going to parties.  SHE FORGOT TO TELL ME THAT SHE WAS GOING ON A TRIP!  total emotional crash.  this is not a good week.  not to mention that drivers' ed (classroom) is a waste of 2 hours of my morning.

      even those whom you think have forgotten about you come back...eventually.  tonight, a guy who i haven't talked to since february(no real reason...)called me.  i was really surprised:)  the weird thing is, i've been thinking about him a lot.  and i guess that he's been thinking about me, too.  he said that...something to that effect.  we're gonna try to hang out soon.  maybe jam out on guitars or summat.  :)  too bad my mom is being too much of a bitch to let me have him over on friday.

      i've gone driving twice in the past 2 days.  fun!  yesterday was my first time on the road.  it's very comfortable for me, surprisingly.  maybe it was because my dad was around both times.  my mom is jumpy.  today i drove myself from my friend jenna's grad party to my friend devin's grad party, where out of town boy was.  i'd talked to both devin and out of town boy, and i knew that ootb would be there.  it was pleasant.  fun.  i wish things like this would happen more often.  anyway, about driving.  i drove on 2 really effing busy highways, and didn't get pulled over by the cops and didn't do anything wrong...except when i went to turn onto devin's road, i underestimated the distance i needed to stop, since i couldn't see the road.  thank gawd nobody was coming!  i love parties.  so much fun!!!!!!  i can't wait for school to end.

      the jazz band concert last night.  outrageous.  fun.  cool people.  good friends.:}  i saw a few of my college-age friends--a nice surprise!  i'm going to be seeing some of them somewhat regularly now, because i, as well as a few of the guys, are in city band.  funfun:]  one of my friends saw the new guitar for the first time last night--he was amazed by the gargantuan size of the beast.  it was a funny conversation!  and of course, it's always nice to get a hug from that one once in a while...such a very nice boy.  yeah, then i woke up at 4:15 in the morning and felt like i was going to throw up.  not fun.  and then the damn toilet kept running.  5 MINUTES!!!!!!!!!  time to get it fixed!  oh, and today was bad.  i woke up at 7:15, exactly the time that german band starts.  wooohooo.  and then i leave all of my homework at home.  then i got to german band, and the guy who sits next to me would not leave me alone about being late.  asshole.  (later, i made a comment about it to a girl who sits in front of me in a class and she said,  "he's that mean?  i've never known him to be mean like that."  i hate that guy.)  between that time and band, i was just kind of in a daze.  and then, during band, i found a stand that i could use to take the exam.  i had looked behind me and saw a chair.  well, i sat down, and a half a second later, i was on the floor half laughing, half crying.  and of course, the guy who sits next to me was a total ass about it.  nobody even tried to catch me.  i just wanted to get out of there.  and then my band director yelled at me for asking a friend to get my pen for me.  and i still had no chair.  i had to stand, crying, for almost 5 minutes before someone got a chair for me.  it's nice to know that there are people (outside of my 4 really good friends) that care.  fuckers.

      holy jeezus.  no words can describe this past weekend...except... HAPPY BIRTHDAY!   shit.  first, on friday, i had no money for a yearbook.  i was really upset that day anyway, but when i remembered that yearbooks were being handed out, i was really really upset.  so i frantically called my mom 5 times within a half hour, only actually reaching her ONCE.  so she came with the checkbook, yelling at me while we were walking toward the gym, and we walk in.  all of a sudden, my two best friends turn around and hand me a yearbook.  i pretty much died right there.  well, not really.  i just cried my eyes out.  i couldn't believe it!  they spent  $40  on that for me!  i couldn't believe it.  yeah.  after that, my mom was not very happy with me...for a while at least.  things got better as the night went on after our short and emotional quarrel after school.  i think we both needed to say what we did.  oh, and the korean boy gave me a gift that i was not to open until the next day.  a bit creepy when he handed it to me, i guess.  it gets worse.  okay.  saturday.  right after midnight.  i open korean boy's present.  it's a $150 minidsic player.  i was more shocked than happy.  a little dreadful, in fact.  he has it bad for me.  but i perceive us only to be friends.  later in the day i confronted him about it (told him that i could not keep it because of its monetary value and the occasion and our relationship status, etc.) and he wouldn't take it back.  this is messy, and probably going to get worse.  i dunno yet. anyway, at a decent time in the morning, i got up and ate breakfast that my mom cooked for me (accompanied by her favorite '50s music) and opened presents.  enjoyable!  then we sat around for a while and did nothing (well, i was actually admiring my gifts) and then i showered and my mom and i went to sheboygan for food for the family party yesterday.  we also went to tj maxx, where she also bought me a cute late '50s-style party dress and a nice pair of white cropped pants.  and then she bought me some sushi for lunch!!!  we got home, and her friend from chicago sent some flowers for me (even after saying in our phone convo earlier that she had something else for me).  so sweet!  then we went to church and at the end, she made the whole congregation sing for me.  after church, i was invited to my best friend's house to  "hang out" , but had to be late because of the talk with korean boy.  so, after that fiasco, i went home to change and went over to my friend's house.  that little  "hang out"  time with her ended up being a   SURPRISE PARTY   (!!!!!!!!!!!) with all of my closest friends.  IT WAS SPLENDIFOROUS!  i had no clue that they would plan something like this...it was the greatest b-day ever.  i was there 'til after midnight.  all that while, my parents were toiling in the kitchen for the next day's big meal.  sunday:  got up, finished cleaning, working, etc.  and got ready for the lunch with my family.  lunch was enjoyable, well-tasting, and fun.  my parents surprised me with an original copy of "David Bowie and the Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars" and a MANDOLIN!!!!!!!!!!!  i'd wanted a mandolin for sooooo long...gosh.  it's so much fun to play!  i probably annoyed the heck out of my family!    today i had to go and play for band for the memorial day celebration (no parade this year--too much rain!) and then i went to my brother's boy scout troop leader's house for a while.  the low point of the weekend.  then i got home and was bored for a little while until my friends who planned the party came over.  we had fun just being stupid and playing guitar.  they like john mayer, and i taught them a chord that he uses often.  they spazzed over that.  it was funny!  my little sister drew a pic of my friend...and even drew on the zits.  what a little chump.  god.  i felt so bad about that.  but it was funny.  good weekend.  this is the happiest i've been in a very, very long time.

      i've deleted my&nbsp;two other blogs.&nbsp; why?&nbsp;  why not? &nbsp; i can't find a reason for having two dormant blogs, on top of this one...  there was just no need.   well, yesterday was the last time that i would see laura while she is here...i'm going to be gone starting tomorrow for 3 or so weeks...and she'll be in illinois when i come back.&nbsp;  i'm missing so much while i'm gone.&nbsp; one of my friends from washington will be here for four days; i'm missing a friend's rock show in a proximal town; i'm missing a guerilla theater show that my friends are doing; my friend's goodbye party(he's leaving for japan); a german band show; MY BEST FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY PARTY...   the list goes on and on.&nbsp; it's disgusting.&nbsp;  nothing happens ALL SUMMER until i'm gone .   my sister is a little fuckin brat.&nbsp; i can't stand her right now.  a few days ago, my mom had left to play bingo with a neighbor.&nbsp; she left us some very scrumptious donuts for breakfast.&nbsp; she left a note and said she'd be back by quarter to&nbsp;eleven that morning.&nbsp; my sister spent the whole time on the computer, then at about quarter after ten, announced that her moron friends were coming.&nbsp; they showed up and she LET THEM IN.&nbsp; we're not supposed to have people in the house when the parents aren't home.&nbsp; so, she broke a huge rule.&nbsp; and i didn't stop her.&nbsp; she wouldn't have listened to me anyway.&nbsp; it's not about what her bratty friends would think...it's the fact that i would be wasting my time.&nbsp; so i continued eating.  mom came home, and they were still here.&nbsp; after they left, mom asked if they were in the house and my sister said "just for a&nbsp;minute."&nbsp; at least she could've lied!&nbsp; but no.&nbsp; and then my mom came over to me and bitched me out about not stopping her.&nbsp; she said i'm "not responsible in any way."&nbsp; i'm like(thinking)  fuck that.&nbsp; i don't give a rat's ass. &nbsp; and i didn't.  but it's supposedly my fault.&nbsp; my fault that my idiot sister (who is now thirteen years old and can decide for herself) can't make the right choices.   (conor was supposed to come over--we were going to call michiko...but that was the next day, and there was no way it was going to happen anymore.&nbsp; i was SOOO FUCKIN PISSED!&nbsp; that would've been the last time i could've talked to michiko before conor left...and the last time i could've seen him before he left.&nbsp; i'm so angry.&nbsp; i don't think i'll be able to talk directly with her for a very, very long time.)  she makes me extremely angry very often.&nbsp; sometimes i really want to beat the shit out of her.&nbsp; but i wouldn't.&nbsp; i'm not like that.&nbsp; i want to be a good sister to her.&nbsp; i want her to learn easily what i had to learn the hard way.&nbsp; sometimes easily doesn't happen...  for instance:&nbsp; at dinnertime, after i was done getting yelled at (again), i informed my mom that my sister's best friend's mom was allowing my sister to use a phone card to call this dude ("crash") in stoughton (which is a bazillion miles away from here) whom she considers her "boyfriend." (not.)&nbsp; i have never believed that it was in her place to allow my sister to do that, when my mom had specifically disallowed that.&nbsp; so i narked on my sister.  i made her "lose a friend."&nbsp; but neither my mom nor i think that she should be around those conniving types.  i got back, in a way...but i don't feel good about it.&nbsp; i think we're even.&nbsp; i think.  okay.&nbsp; so this i probably my last post before i leave tomorrow.&nbsp; chicago tomorrow, south dakota saturday (for a week), then off to glacier national park in montana(for however long we're staying there).&nbsp; hopefully i'll have some sort of compy access during the trip...but i'm not counting on it.  i'll need a lot of the spree to keep me...well...close to sane.&nbsp;&nbsp; this trip is going to suck.&nbsp; it doesn't matter that we're going to the most beautiful place in the whole country...  god i hope there are some hot guys there.

      "love the life you choose...keep yourself feeling brand new..."  &nbsp;  hmm (more like  huzzah ) ...&nbsp;  the polyphonic spree  has proven itself to be a source of great calm and outright  radiance  in such a time of, well...dismal happenings.&nbsp; at least, to me.  &nbsp;  really, i think they're saving me.&nbsp; little by little.&nbsp; i (re)discovered them a few weeks ago after going through lists of songs that i wanted to download.&nbsp; their song, "light & day/reach for the sun" is the one that turned me on to them, and i remembered that while i was at a target store in a proximal town.&nbsp; i bought the disc, and was immediately amazed at their sheer volume.&nbsp; well...i guess a better word to describe their sound is  mass .&nbsp; they sound  HUGE!  &nbsp; there are something like 24 people in the group.   &nbsp;   urlLink http://www.thepolyphonicspree.com    urlLink http://www.togetherwereheavy.com   &nbsp;  the second&nbsp;site&nbsp;is&nbsp;devoted to&nbsp;their 2nd album, which came out a week ago.&nbsp; i'm constantly listening to it.&nbsp; i recommend both of them, if you need something happy to listen to.&nbsp; :}  &nbsp;  my neighbor's german niece is here for a few weeks.&nbsp; i met her yesterday--she's pretty cool.&nbsp; i can't pronounce (much less spell!) the name of the town from which she hails...&nbsp; eh.  i guess i should learn some german.  &nbsp;  speaking of learning languages...  i found out that i might be crossing a BIG pond (east of here) &nbsp;next summer.&nbsp; my town's municipal band is waltzing around with the idea of going to the  czech republic   next summer!!!!&nbsp; i'm really excited!&nbsp; and, even better--i might actually be able to learn some czech between now and then.&nbsp; i have&nbsp;a czech friend who lives in sheboygan.&nbsp; i'm hoping she can help me with a few things...   &nbsp;  oh, and on sunday, after arriving at a coffeehouse in sheboygan for my friends' gig, i noticed nick ("out of town boy") walking in.&nbsp; i was really nervous, but pleasantly surprised.&nbsp; he was on his way back to milwaukee (where he now lives and has 2 jobs!) but stopping there to meet some friends from his town.&nbsp; we talked for a looooonnnnggg time.&nbsp; it was good to see him again.  it was good to see conor again, too.&nbsp; he's been coming to my house to hang out--with no success.&nbsp; i'm never home when he shows up!&nbsp; poor guy.  ~~~~~~~  but, through all this, i'm still feeling not-so-good.&nbsp; a friend (not naming which) called up yesterday with some news pertaining to her -significant other- and what they did the evening before...not that it was like...third base or anything...but it was a good round past second.&nbsp; it's not exactly what i want to hear, especially if i'm graced with  all  of the details.&nbsp; i'm happy for her, but it makes me feel like shit.&nbsp; because it reminds me that i don't have  any  luck with guys.&nbsp; it just doesn't happen for me.  &nbsp;  the ouija board told me a few weeks ago that i'd start going out with my friend chris on july 25th.&nbsp; i haven't had so much as a call from him since i saw him at the end of june.&nbsp; and guys from my town are pretty much off-limits.&nbsp; they're all taken--and if they're not, they're too full of themselves to be fun to be around.&nbsp; it's disgusting.  &nbsp;  so this is it.&nbsp; not much.&nbsp; well, i guess there was a lot going on...but whatever.&nbsp; i'm excited for thursday night.&nbsp; more about that later.

      nix that. i'm back.  i just read a friend's blog, and i miss him so much right now.  it's almost inexplainable.  his kind, comforting words always make me feel better, always make me take a (much needed) look at the brighter side of life. i saw this friend today, walking down the street, going home from his job.  and i freaked.  my best friend, lauren, was excited too.  she knows how much i admire this one.  i haven't talked to him in a few weeks.  i haven't seen him in longer.  i'm sad that i can't hang out with him on a regular basis anymore.  thinking about it really depresses me.  dammit, here i go with the complaining shit again.

(maybe that's the key--have fun, then say goodbye!)  and i know that she's coming back, since she wants to go to college here.  i'm going to bleach my hair yet tonight--i'll have pictures up soon.  oh, by the way, if anyone happens to read this--you radiohead fans are fun!

      i can't sleep.  again. this is what i thought up as i lay awake (crying) about 20 minutes ago.  it's an imaginary conversation that i had with my friend conor (i've decided to use names now!).  i whispered this to myself, thinking that this would play out in real life--even though he would hate me for it.  (pretentious, whiney bitch!)  this is, of course, in person (at his house). _____________________________________________  me: conor, i feel like i know you pretty well... c:  yeah, i would say that me: good.  but i kinda ask this of everyone...it's so i don't piss off or offend anyone...but you seem like the type... c:  yeah... me: ...the type that i can speak my mind to. c:  of course. me: that's what you think.  i know you've heard about my crazy mom and all that but that's the kind of stuff i tell everyone. c:  oh.  well, go ahead anyway. me: (grimly smiles)  thank you.  (pause--look around, think a bit)  i don't think you're going to want to talk to me after i say this.  it's going to make me sound really whiney and bitchy. c:  okay... (mimmicking me) me: funnyhaha. c:  go on. me:  it's been a little depressing for me to talk to you lately.  it's not your fault.  i don't know if  you're going to understand this...but every time i talk to you, all i can think of is your one-way ticket to japan and all of the opportunities you have...and a girlfriend(to the reader--think significant other)...a supportive family...lots of caring, interested friends...charisma...  all of that makes me very jealous of you.  i don't possess any of those things, but want them all very, very much.  i'm lost at sea.  i don't know what to do. i'm sorry.  maybe i should leave. c:  oh...don't, please.  how did this come about? me: you don't want to hear it.  it's too painful to explain.  i shouldn't have said anything. c:  (irritated)  then, why the hell did you bring it up? me: i'm sorry.  i'll see you later.  (heads for the door, walks out) c:  (yells out door)  you're going to walk? me: i can't talk to you right now. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this is the madness i think of as an insomniac.  i wallow in my own sadness and my own inabilities...my own shortcomings.  i need someone to get me out of this funk.  better put, this hellhole.  this is what happens when my best friend is too wrapped up in her "icky boy" to make plans with me.  now i'm thinking terrible things.  i'm leaving.

      someone take me away. i need to get out of here. very soon.  but will that happen?  will i find emotional support anywhere?  when can i stop being everyone's crutch???  i can't take it anymore.  i'm sick of being treated like shit. i want to be happy again.  but i can't see things getting too much better...at least, for a while.  another friend is leaving me, and i will be left with a kleenex and a broken heart.  i'm struggling to work out a time when me and my best friend can get together.  she's always doing something with "icky boy," or i'm not able to come over because of some bullshit reason a la my mom. i'm getting really jealous of all of my friends.  they are all happy and finding people to make them smile and doing things with the rest of their friends.  but i'm not included anymore.  it's impossible for me to find a boyfriend.  i don't have a job.  i don't have a car.  my family doesn't give a damn about me. that's why i don't want to see my friends.  none of them.  i don't want to be around other people.  but i do.  and that's what i hate.  my mom and i had another argument yesterday, and i haven't talked to her since then.  i figure, if she's too self-centered to know when i leave, then why the hell should i talk to her?  after i went to my room last night, she never checked on me.  my dad came and tried to get me to go to the stupid party that my mom ruined the summer for, but i blatantly refused.  i'm not a glutton for that kind of punishment.   (why go somewhere else to be really fuckin bored when you can stay at home and feel the same way?)    today my dad came in (at like 11:30 this morning) and got me up.  everyone else had left, and he took me driving.  we stopped at hamburger haus in dundee for some ice cream and burgers.  that's the most attention anyone's paid to me all week.

      god.  i'm sick of being dragged to these places i don't want to go to...  last night, i went to a nearby resort town for fireworks, and of course, i don't know anyone there.  before we left, my mom wouldn't let me  get out of the car  to get a book.  the book: "rush limbaugh is a big fat idiot and other observations" by al franken.  I LOVE IT!  bored.

      I AM SO FUCKING BORED...  my korean girl friend just left my house and i'm waiting for a friend to call me when he is done with work for the day.  i don't know when that will be, so i will be bored, i think, indefinitely.  i drove with an actual instructor for the first time today.  today was also my first time driving a compact car.  it was strange!  their speed is much harder to control than a minivan's i think, but i better get used to it.  i'll be driving small cars for the rest of my life after high school!  BORED!
