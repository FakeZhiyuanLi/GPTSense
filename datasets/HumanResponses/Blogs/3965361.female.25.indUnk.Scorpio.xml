      Suddenly one day there was snow everywhere! Okay, not everywhere.. but in a section of newly opened sims. I don't read the forums too often, so if it was announced anywhere I had no clue. The only reason I even knew it had happened was I went to the website for something, and saw a picture advertising that it had opened... dated that day. Fun! Like many others, I rushed to the south east to see what it was all about.   What the Lindens have added is definitely very cool, no pun intended. And it's very refreshing in the heat of July to escape to the "snowy" hills in SL! Inspired by this wintery landscape, I decided it was time to try my hand at designing, so I dug out the templates and made a line of winter wear. It didn't take too long to create, but it did take a while... but the longest part was getting the pictures and getting it all boxed and into a vendor. Really late Monday night (or rather, 3am Tuesday morning) I had the first wave ready to go. I set it up, put up an event for the next day and off I went.   The following day I logged in long after the event because it was a no-host deal, and was shocked when I saw my in-world money balance. I couldn't believe how well it did!! And people kept visiting all day long, even after the event was over. Spurred on by the success, I quickly went off to do a few more designs and make a line of menswear, then got those up that night. Now I have my property listed as a shop in the "Find" listings, and I have a booth at a popular mall. It's so much fun!   I have to quote my favorite comment so far about it...   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your stuff is pimpin'!"  :)

       Well here it is... my blog! It's always interesting to keep track of things going on, so I've decided to start up this blog.. dedicated soley to my second life! If you got here from somewhere other than Second Life, here's a quick explanation:   urlLink  Second Life    is a 3D virtual reality world hosted online and visited by hundreds of people worldwide. In "SL" you can meet new friends, go to parties and events, own land and build houses or anything you can imagine, sell anything you can make, and play around with dozens of various vehicles and toys, to give you a short list. It's very much like real life, except it's not! It's your  second  life!     In SL I am known as Cydonia Llewelyn. Cydonia has been my online name for a few years now, and I chose it after the area on Mars where the infamous pyramids and "face" hill are located. Llewelyn was one of a drop-down list of choices when signing up for my account, and I chose that after the new age spiritual publishing company, "  urlLink  Llewelyn Publications   ". I have been in SL since May 22nd, 2004, and I found it really easy to make friends here. I long ago gave up on online chatrooms because they were usually quite dull, and SL is definitely far from dull! I've been online for almost 10 years, and saw the onlien chatrooms progress from fun "hang outs" to meet new friends and chat about interests, to horridly dull rooms where the extent of conversation became "asl" (age, sex, location) checks so people could meet up for cybering. SL has it's share of sex-related topics, but they're of a mature nature and there are specific locations for these activities. One of the best features of SL is that it's an 18+ community, so you don't have to be concerned that the person you're clicking with could be a minor.    I currently own land in the "sim" (region) known as Ebisu. I shifted things around quite a few times since I first joined, but now I think I have it just where I like it. I bought a pre-fab house and really like how it turned out. I also own part of Ebisu Lake, and have a fun little dock there for swimming. Now I've started to think&nbsp;about designing things to sell, and have come up with the name "Llewelyn Moon Design" to put on everything I make.    I'll add more later.. for now, stop reading and go check it out! Your second life awaits!!
