      This story must be told:  Study Abroad Trip: Salamanca, Spain I will never forget Michael. Was it just the magic of the city? Could it have been the lyrics of my Norah Jones CD? Or maybe it was the blue in his eyes. Was I really in love with two men, or did I just terribly miss my boyfriend waiting for me at home? I don't think that I will ever know what it was exactly.  It was the first Thursday in Salamanca, almost the end of the first school week. My eyes were still a little puffy from crying myself to sleep the night before, I missed my boyfriend like no other. The visually gratifying walk to school and the laughs that I shared with my new found found friends made me forget all about my sadness, and focus on how unbelievably lucky I was to get to opportunity to be here. With all that, my puffy eyes were no more. A few drinks, a few friends, no curfew, and no school the next day, it was off to our favorite club in Salamanca, the Irish Rover. There I was laughing and dancing to the music. Until then I had managed to look at every guy that passed my way as if they were just a faceless figure, it was like I was blind to every man except my boyfriend,( who was ten-thousand miles away). My "sight" was recovered when Michael came my way.  Why was I dancing with him? Plenty of men attempted and failed horribly. Why was I smiling? I think it was the way that he did it. He danced my way ever so nonchalantly, as if he really wasn't trying to dance with me at all. This unique attempt made me laugh, it worked, I had to give him credit. He was a very handsome man. He had a beautiful face. Those piercing blue eyes, I felt so helpless when he looked right at me, as if for a few moments my entire body had gone numb and the only thing that I could feel would me my breath being taken away from me. Those lips, he had those lips that if you looked at them long enough, you would unconsciously lick your own in the hopes that they just might kiss yours. His skin, never had I been so curious to know what another mans skin felt like. All of these feelings were so deep down inside of me that I did not allow them to be visible, not even to myself, but the more that I saw him and the more that I thought about him in the following weeks, the more all these felling surfaced. So there we were, dancing, smiling, looking at each other then looking away. We exchanged names, he informed me that he wanted my number, I informed him that I had a boyfriend. It didn't seem to bother him, we just wanted to dance. His body moved every which way that I wanted it to, he was a fantastic dancer. After the boyfriend issue was made verbal, and set in stone, we went down the we're-just-friends-road. This was great, my first friend outside the group that I traveled here with. Being just friends and all, we parted ways for the last hour or so. It was really late, or should I say early, it was time to say goodbye to my new friend Michael. We said our quick goodbyes that night. At that moment it wouldn't have bothered me if I'd ever see him again  The very next day I was in an unusually good mood, I had spent the entire day by myself enjoying the fascination I had for the city. The cathedrals, the quiet parks, the dozens of fountains that I threw a coin in, the comfortable chaos of the Plaza Mayor, the cool winter air, -- and Michael! Michael? After the hundreds of faceless figures that day, my sight once again came back to me when I saw him there alone, in the most crowded street in Salamanca, sitting on a bench. He noticed me immediately after I did. I kept walking because for a moment I did not believe it was him. Someone you meet in a dance club looks a little different when you see them again in their true form. I smiled, took a couple of steps back, and sat down next to him, all the while staring at him in a what-are-you-doing-here way. It felt so good to talk to him, like he was an old friend that I hadn't seen for years. We spoke of our lives, our family, why we were here in Spain. I t was one of the best conversations I had ever had with someone that I ran into on the street. We both really didn't have anywhere to be at that moment but with each other. He impressed me by mentioning that the only reason he was on that very bench was just to watch the world pass by. His comment made me smile and I felt really lucky to be joining him in him in his favorite place. One hour and one new friend later, it was once again, time to go. We walked together until we stopped at a crossroads where we had to part ways, but this time I had no doubt in my mind that I was going to see him again. He asked for my number one more time, but this time I was not hesitant to give it to him, to my new friend.  One day, and a couple of text-messages later and there we were, underneath the clock of the Plaza Mayor, for what later became known as our first date. How could a night that started off so innocently end with me coming home at eight in the morning?. . .  To be continued. . .

           We started off the evening by going to a bar that I knew all of my friends were going to be at.  I hated every minute of it; I didn't’ want to share him with them.  God knows I love my new found friends to no end, but I share so much of my day, my life, my room, my meals, my school, and my nights with them.  Michael was the only thing that was all mine in Spain.  I didn't’t want to share.  Call it childish, but having him all to myself made me feel like I had a little piece of home.  We quickly said our goodbyes to my friends and I finally had him all to myself again.  Michael, my new friend, and now my little piece of home.        We went to a great salsa club, sitting down at what we claimed to be “ "the best seats in this here place".  We got into a more personal, a more deep, and a more fun conversation.  The words “I wish you didn't’ have a boyfriend” hit me like cannon ball to the stomach.  I could have just picked myself up, dusted myself off, and ended it right then and there.  I did not end it; instead, I just smiled politely, and lowered my head as if I had just been told an embarrassing compliment.  What was I doing there with him?  I knew he liked me.  I once again asked myself why I was dancing with him, and why I was smiling.  What was it about him that night that made me stay for as long as I did?  Was it the way we found it humorous how we both walked at the same fast-pace around the cold city?  Was it the way the light hit his face when we were on that ledge looking over the city, or the bridge looking over the river?  I think I knew what it was that sent me over the edge so-to-speak.        It’s really is strange how a common interest in music can bond  people together.  He knew and loved all of my favorite music artists, and even worse, knew all of the lyrics to my favorite songs.      We walked arm in arm together around the city singing quite loudly to random songs.  I had never met a guy who without even trying, sang so well.  I could have listened to him serenade to me for days.  I did not want the night to end, but we were heading so near to my apartment, that I had to think of something.  So, to stretch the night out, and inevitably get myself into more emotional trouble then I already had, I brought down a handful of CD's and a portable CD player.  What the hell was I thinking?  Music had an intoxicating effect on me with him.  We walked to a small secluded park by my place and I showed him my music.  Every song sounded better than the next with him next to me.        REALITY CHECK: What is a girl who is crazy in love with her boyfriend, back at home,  doing with a guy that she just met no more than two days before, in a park, at 3 in the morning, listening to romantic music?       I asked myself that question dozens of times that night, hoping that it would knock some sense into me, but it failed. Songs with titles like "Your Body is a Wonderland", "Nearness of You", and "Come Away with Me" drove me to want to bite my tongue off after asking him to dance with me. But turned out, I didn't want to be anywhere in the world but there, listening to the timeless sounds of Norah Jones while I was slow dancing in circles with Michael underneath a tree. For hours and hours we danced underneath that tree, so much that we made a mock "crop circle", it surprised us, we laughed, and kept dancing.  It started to rain, but all it did was make me want to get closer.  My cheeks would barely caress his face.  I feared making eye contact for too long.  Tears secretly ran down my face.  I got closer to Michael that night then I had ever gotten close to any other man since my first date with my boyfriend.   I never thought that I would be here; I never thought that I would do this.  It had been less than two weeks since I said goodbye to the love of my life at the airport.  And here I was, having the most fun that I had on this trip since.  I had a split personality mentality throughout the entire night.  One part of me wanted nothing more than to dance with him, hold him, touch his skin, and gently kiss those lips all night long.  Then the other part of me wanted nothing more than to run away, take my music, and run my ass home, and hope that I never see this intoxicating, hypnotic man ever again.   I stayed, and had the most horribly great time of my life.  My Norah Jones CD had never sounded so romantic, it had also never been played so many times consecutively, poor CD, poor Michael for having to walk home at eight in the morning, and poor me for being left along with my thoughts, my guilt, my desires.   You'd think that I would have learned from that night.  You would think.  Oh but no.  I was right there with him again, a couple of nights later. . .                            . . .
