       Wassup,   Since my ass is so bored I figured I might as well chip in on this idea created by the all mighty and short Leah.  Not bad though, not bad at all.  gotta give it to ya.  I hope everyone is having a great time.  I believe by now, hopefully, Pepe should have posted the pictures from the camino onto ofoto, so if yall want to check it out, feel free (if not, my bad, call Pepe and complain, not me!lol.they got all the pics)Yall know me, I have been up to the same old mischief:getting piss ass drunk, streaking, throwing up, lo normal(a.k.a. sitting on my ass studying and being an angel/mama's boy.)        Before I knock out, I'll give yall a quick brief summary of what we did since we said our goodbyes in Madrid.   During the camino, it was hot as mofo'in hell but we all made it through, Mark, Pepe, and I.  Pepe and I for a while really had some pretty cool farmer tans. We met a lot a dope people, and we met others....not so dope. I remember one day when it was blazin outside and we all decided to jump in a river.  It was all good till the current swept away my flip flop and I busted my ass trying to chase that bitch down.  Pepe and I took some....interesting fotos in the water.  Then we all ran out once Mark screamed, "LEACHES!"lolol When we finally reached Santiago, we realized that our saying during school was a load of crap, "Don't worry! You'll lose it on the camino!"  There were days when I found myself eating five sandwhiches with ham, cheese, and mashed chips;a liter and a half of water;a pack of cookies; and two bananas and an orange.  Ladies and gentleman, that was only for lunch! Anyway, after the camino we traveled home and had a going away lunch with the teachers one last time at Pasta Nostra(bangin ass brownie!)The one thing I remember is when Mark, Pepe, and I were in the computer room and then Todd walked in and said,"...You guys stink!"lol.  But I have to admit, that shit was kickin, almost as bad as leah's feet.lol.  Finally we departed and went our separate ways.  On the fifteenth I received a warm welcoming to the states with a bomb threat at JFK(my mother went up the wall, literally!)Since then, I've been hangin out, maxin and relaxin.   Well, it's late, I'm chillin, and it's quiet.  Before I hit the sack I just wanna give a shout out to everyone.  WASSUP YALL! I hope yall are safe and takin it easy. Give a special shout out to Mark who's probably shootin shit up trying to make up for the year in spain, Pepe who's probably slicing some cat up with his fencing shit, Will who I hope is safe and chillin in Spain with some hot as chick, he deserves it, and finally Leah who's chillin in wack ass Rhode Island and sleepin right now because she gotta go to school, have fun, miss ya!lololol Aight dogs, I'm out. THis shit wasn't as short as I thought it would be.  Well, anyway, write back, don't be strangers and if yall want to visit, feel free, the bathtub is always empty!Peace Z...z....Z....z...Z...z

      Hey So seeing as we seem to suck at group e-mails because I haven't seen any of them come my way....which I assume means we haven't been sending them I figured I would create a blog because this way we can share pictures and just all keep in touch.  Tell everyone from SYA you want about it.  I thought it would be a good way for us to all keep in touch.  To send pictures you have to download Hello.  It is really easy to use.  Well hope to hear from y'all soon.  Un beso Leah

       Umm okay, random moment… So I got an e-mail and a pic from the girl who’s going to be my future roommate. She seems nice and very smart (she knows 6 languages or something). I think we’re going to get along quite well except she said she likes to watch a lot of TV…that might be a problem. Can YOU draw a frog? I got a cute little pig cup that I think I’m going to use to put all my coins. Todas esas monedas que no cambian en los bancos y ¿saben porque? ¡Porque no tienen uso, son innecesarios! Mental spasm! Mental Spasm! Necesito comer fruta. So I hit my chin (sometime between when I woke up and now) and it looks like a dark purple marker splotch. I have been infected with chin-arker disease. The saddest thing is I don’t know con que me pegue. LOSSING THE LITTLE SANITY I HAD TO BEGIN WITH. He he he he he the phone is ringing. Yesterday I watched four hours straight of TV, that’s how bored I was! And guess what I was wondering about while I was watching those shows; I was wondering si ¿han probado las alcachofas con queso? Son muy ricas. Did you notice how I’m no longer using vosotros? There’s no need. I’m also relearning to treat elders by usted instead of tu. Hablando de elders, mañana me voy a la playa con mis abuelitos, mis tíos, mi primo y mi hermano. Espero que sea divertido. Me tengo que ir a hacer mi cama…there’s too much pink on this computer and way  too many 15 year olds around.  ¡Espero que estén bien!

      Wassup yall,  It's been pretty quiet on blogger so I figured I would spicy it up a little bit! Give yall the low down on what's poppin in E-town.(oh shit, free stylin!) On saturday, Pepe and Ashley came DOWN TO E-TOWN to pick me up to go to SIx Flags.  That shit was mad fun.  Though I have to admit, I was the biggest punk there.  for those who ain't know, my ass don't really like roller coasters so I was MAAAAAD nervous and freakin out and shit. all ashley wanted to do was go on roller coasters.  I was thinkin,"Damn, I'm fucked!" I overcame my fear though.  I sucked in my gut, and went on all the coasters they went on.  We were chillin! Yo, I went on Nitro.  Yo, ask ashley and pepe how nervous I was.  My ass could not shutup!lol. Then we indulged ourselves on Dippin Dots ice cream for my reward.  lol  I'm a punk.  The pictures afterwards that they took while you're on the coaster were mad funny.  Then we went on a couple of water rides to cool off a bit.  OUr asses got soaked.   It was mad hot too! My theory still holds true since I todavia, don't have skin cancer: a sunburn encima of another sunburn equals tan.  I'm a genius!lol(far from it) Well, unfortunately, we had to leave early because of me.  I felt bad. Lots of ice cream and funnel cakes along with roller coasters don't mix.  I was hurlin in every possible direction! that shit was nasty........................sike nah.............I had to make my debut as SPIDERMAN at my cousin's birthday party at seven. Couldn't let him down. THAT SHIT WAS EVEN CRAZIER! Yo, check it, I came in as spiderman, tell me why the kids almost started fightin!  Half of the kids, the little ones, were all my devoteful followers who really believed i was spiderman, and the rest, older kids, saying,"Yeah, lets unmask spiderman!".  They jumped my ass hardcore. They were pullin, biting, punchin, huggin, feelin all over me.  That shit was fun though, but mad hot in that costume. some were like,"Hey, spiderman doesn't have long hair!" I was like, "what u talking about! that shit's the style now and days!"  It was a tough crowd.   AFterwards, I went out on the street fully dressed in the costume.  we went to a CVS and they were wylin.  the lady at the cashier was like over the INTERCOM, "jen, jen please come to the front desk, spiderman is here to see you" Then, this chick had the audacity to smack my ass! I was scared! Ma friends were like, "Damn son, u betta watch out, she gonna rape you!"  SHe then led me to the parking lot and we started saying hello to everyone out there.  cars were beepin, I was sayin hello to little kids, grown ups.  One lady said I could make money doin that cuz I really look like him.  Think of that, a ghetto ass spiderman.lolol.  I took some pics, I'll send yall them once they're developed.  don't laugh too much.  lol...It was funny, we were at a red light, and I was bobbin ma head to some music with the costume on.  All of sudden, some cat pulls to the side of us surprised as hell! He was laughin and shit.  Ma friends in the car were rollin! Then we went home and my brother, who's mad skinny;ma friend alberto, who got a gut;and ma brother's girl, who's a girl tried the costume on.  We were dyin from laughter.  That shit was sooo funny.  we took pictures of that too. I'll send ya them once I getem.  Well, I think that's nuf for now.  Hope yall is being safe and having fun. I'll holla back if sometin dope happens, like if I hit the lottery.  Till then, peace!

      Yo  1:Who is thunda? 2:All good times here in Barbate de Franco (His vacation home used to be in this town, now its a big discotec). Working with horses, tough, but fun. Beautiful scenery. Anyways, Leah this was a good idea. Ashley came down to visit fo a few days, that was cool. We got really fucked up one night though, a little too much for my tastes. We were rolling a fat one when Antonio and Olivia (the girl from New Zealand con que estoy trabajando y su novio guitarrista) came home and we were real worried but then they just demanded some of it so we sat and got stoned together. Too stoned. Oh well. Good thing I didn´t have to work the next morning. Cadiz is really chill too. I think ´they should consider moving Sya there. Its somewhat smaller than good ol Zgz but it feel more like a city bcs its always been such an important port and international place. Theres also a really cool castle wit a bridge that goes over the water and u can jump off the bridge. I miss yall. TOMMY I WANT MY JERSEYS BACK!!!!!!! I wish I had people my age to go out with, cause chillin with Olivia and Antonio´s friends is cool but not that cool. Some of yall will be proud to know that I have not met a single girl my age for over a month. Its rugged but when the going gets tough, the tough get going.Ok. lets face it, I really miss u guys and I´m not getting all mushy. Ok, maybe I am but it doesnt´stop it being true. Anyways, good beach, good tan, good, relaxing times. I even got to try kitesurfing a little. The wind was real gusty and I got thrown all over the place but it was fun. Those things will really drag you. I got up on the board but only for a few seconds and then inevitably the kite would either with no air and I would fall backwards then to be jerked forwards again when it recaught the air or it would pull me so hard I would fall forwards and skim across the water. Anyways, ok. Looking forward to seein yall, we may get together over new years, so put it in your calendars.

I placed it back in that little box you had it in cuz I ain't have no room to put it.well....I WANT IT! think u cud take a quick walk and give it to me?pleeeeaseee....sike nah..whenever u can.thanks. Well, just to give yall an update, shit still hasn't changed.  I'm workin but I'm still lookin for shit to do.  lol, today I went to the pizzeria and there is this guy named Tony, we're friends, and he asked me, "hey Frat(my name), when u gonna cut that shit(my hair)!" and I said,"dunno, don't think any time soon."  Then, cuz I'm lookin for a job I asked him whether there was anything open and he said, "are you fuckin crazy look at u!"...(silence and stares).."u look like a fuckin girl!)  Yo, that cat ripped me so badly.  Of course he was playin around but he tore me to pieces.  that shit was funny. I laughed. I dunno, I'm thinkin bout cuttin it.  I'm thinkin it's time for a new look.  I was thinkin along the lines of a mowhawk?lol...any other suggestions...spikes...gel it up?..lol... well, later that afternoon my mother somehow convinced me that my real mother was an ape and that that was the reason for my insanely hairy face and body.....lol...sike nah...though she does call me a monkey....she convinced me to go watch The Notebook at the movie theatres.  I agreed, although I shouldn't have.  Now she's callin me Noah cuz he reminds her of me.  I don't see it but hey, maybe, my friend said the same.  they wylin.  It was a good movie though.  I hated it and I loved it at the same time.  It reminded my a lot about my time in spain,too much actually. that's why I hate it.  I love it cuz....it was good.  Well, nuttin much besides that has happened.  well, besides my new porno name, SPANKALICIOUS.  I think it is fuckin dope as hell! lololol...that always makes me laugh. well, if yall have any dope or funny pics send them this way.  I'd love to take a look!If yall want any just holla or talk to Leah.  ...well, it's late and this shit is long enough.  I'll probably finish watchin the UFO special there givin now although I know I'm not gonna sleep tonight.  My mother terrified me as a child and allowed me to watch an alien autopsy.  Now I piss in my pants wheneva I see a show about aliens......it's a secret....well, wish me luck....and clean sheets when I wake up tomorrow! Merry christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!hohohoho P.S.sweet dreams

Ain't much to keep ya posted on cuz nuttin much has changed.  My ass was busy as hell today cuz my grandmother put ma ass to work.  It was mad hot too!  That shit wasn't funny.  I mowed the lawn, got down on ma hands and knees to cut around the poles, then cut a tree down with ma brother.  We cut all the branches down except at the top.  We gave that shit a mushroom cut.  Now, that shit look like a palm tree, christian/tommy style! Hell yeah! My grandmother hates that shit and thinks it's ugly as hell but is still willing to keep it since we did all the work.  I got a tank top tan line now and all these pricks in my hands from the thorns(yes Leah, laugh all you want!Just wait!haha)Well, I'm sure yall are probably all drunk right running through the streets with ignited fireworks strapped to your backs, so I guess I'll let yall have your fun while yall still can.lol  For some reason, it just doesn't feel like the fourth of july for me this year...well, goodnight!  It's 12:27 in the morning right now and I have to wake up at six for work(one day thing), so in other words I'm pretty fucked!  sorry to keep going but one more thing, I swear! Right now there are mad kids outside, some rollin deep as hell, just fuckin igniting fireworks and letting them shoot from their hands. They ain't them little kiddy ass ones either, them those real shits that you be seeing on t.v.  They's wylin! Well, I promise I'm going to bed right now(not really) and will shut up(tampoco!), but I miss ALL of yall a lot and want yall to be safe and do every single fuckin thing that I wouldn't do cuz yall no me.  If something doesn't involve salsa music, a baseball or bowling ball, or making fun of leah, I ain't doin that shit! Aight dogs, peace out and holla back!  P.S.My birthday is July 27th just so yall know. you know, just in case ya wanna send a little something something my way!haha. P.S.S.
