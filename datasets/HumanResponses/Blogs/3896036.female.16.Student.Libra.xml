       Adventure camp    rocks   .    &nbsp;  The program wasn't very good, but, the people in the camp were very fun to be with. It's been so long since i enjoyed a camp.    &nbsp;  Night one, it was raining very heavily, with all the thunder and lightening and girls' screaming too. So one or two tents collapsed and the FA (faciliators) had to get all of us out. It was a funny sight, a big group of people wearing yellow raincoats running for shelter. Each time there was a lightening flash, people will squat down halfway running, and yeah...screams. So we all got soaked wet and&nbsp; cold.    &nbsp;  Day 2 at Ubin was kinda interesting. We had to use skills learn to find clues using a map and a compass. We were the second group to reach, even though we were stuck for very long on the 2nd clue. The mosquitoes at Ubin are    vicious   !! Thank goodness there was an insect repellent, or i might have had more bites. After we finish the trekking, we went to the mamam beach for lunch. We cooked ourselves and erm.. it was kinda disgusting.. haha. Apple was still the best!    &nbsp;  Night two, the best night ever. We stayed up for very very long to play games in the guys room. We played indian poker and a game called    ti tu tiu   . haha... it was damn fun. indian poker was a lot of sabo-ing, and loser had to drink bottles of water which accumulated every round. Ti&nbsp;tu tiu... haha.. what more can i say.&nbsp;It&nbsp;was&nbsp;   The Game    of the camp.&nbsp;Now we have a Ti Tu Tiu club, with a president and vice president.. haha..    &nbsp;  Day 3, we went to the ELF outdoor area. They have things like flying fox etc.. kind of fun. Alot of group work.. my group may not have won, but it was still very fun. After that we went to pack our tents and went for lunch. The best lunch of the camp - at SAA. Had things like curry puffs, spring rolls, fried rice, PROPERLY cooked bee hoon, chilli fishballs etc. The finale was of coz another few rounds of Ti Tu Tiu!     &nbsp;  Cant wait for tmr where there is going to be Memory Lane for the camp.    Cant wait to play Ti Tu Tiu again with those ppl!

        I'm off to the adventure camp organised by the tp adventure club!     &nbsp;   Why am I going?    1. Cause I&nbsp;want to join a FUN camp, which is not so taxing.&nbsp;After my pri 5 camp, I&nbsp;dont think I have joined a camp which is fun, cause&nbsp;all the camps&nbsp;I went to were band camp, band camp and more band camp.&nbsp;    2. I   think   by joining, i can get&nbsp;some&nbsp;SEAL points... I   think  .. haha    3. Meet more people ^_______^     &nbsp;   Wish me luck that I'll have fun :)

      Today was another boring day... 3 hours of BCS (some stupid  computing stuff), what more can I say! The whole class was so obviously bored, and practically no one was paying attention to the tutor.   Before BCS, at APEL, we had to do a personality survey test. We tabulated the results and plotted it against a graph to see which "fish" we belong too. Yes,   fish  . There are four fishes - Colourful Guppy, Peaceful Angelfish, Powerful Swordtail and Careful Goldfish. You can roughly guess which personality each type represent. So I did the test and guess what, I'm not under any category! The plotted point on the graph was in the middle of nowhere, at the cross section of all the four categories. It's is like saying: Sorry, but you have a personality disorder!    This is so similar to when in sec4, we had to take a career survey test to see what job fits us. And mine said something like "Sorry, there are   no   jobs suitable for you. But dont worry, there are other opportunities." while everyone else had jobs which suited them!  Damn, I'm always the   odd   one out.

      Today was a  bad  day, or at least for me.  At 11, my group (boon, cpc, farissa, sijia, danni, crystal & i) went to do our field trip for FFB sci on supermarkets at TM NTUC today. After the trip, we were late for Intro to H&T lecture, so we ran for the stupid bus 23. While running, my sandals strap broke. So i was like running with a broken sandal on the wet floor, my jeans all soaked in gross water.  I have just finished viewing all 70 pics we took on grace chan's birthday last fri. It was   super   fun! Chan didnt know about the surprise birthday party we (charmaine, carene, cheryl, grace khoh, julianne, peini, zibin & i) were gonna have for her, so she was sulking the whole day (a few days actually) as her good friends "told" her that they could not celebrate it with her. On fri, grace khoh "lured" her back to her house and then we were with the bdae cake! We had a good time, especially with all those food - brownies, chickens, chocolate fondue, oh ya, and bao!  I really really  miss  my sec sch friends. We use to hang out so often, but now with our busy schedules, we have to  plan  to meet. So many wonderful memories...

       Tears   music & lyrics:  Yoshiki   doko ni yukebaii anata to hanarete ima wa sugisatta toki ni toi kakete nagasugita yoru ni tobidachi wo yume mita ikoku no sora mitsumete kodoku wo dakishimete nagareru namida wo toki no kaze ni kasanete owaranai anata no toiki wo kanjite  * Dry your tears with love  Loneliness, your silent whisper fills a river of tears through the night Memory, you never let me cry and you, you never said good-bye Sometimes our tears blinded the love We lost our dreams along the way But I never thought you'd trade your soul to the fates, never thought you'd leave me alone  Time through the rain has set me free Sands of time will keep your memory Love everlasting fades away Alive within your beatless heart  * repeat  nagareru namida wo toki no kaze ni kasanete owaranai kanashimi wo aoi bara ni kaete  * repeat  nagareru namida wo toki no kaze ni kasanete owaranai anata no toiki wo kanjite  * repeat x2

       Blogging.  This is my   first   ever blog, yes, I'm lagging behind practically the rest of the teenage population.  Blogging never interest me, until now.  Maybe seeing too many blogs have influenced me to have a blog of my own. So here I'm am, creating a blog of my own :)  I'm feeling very lethagic, and this has been going on since poly started. Even after awaking from 12 hours of sleep, I still feel tired. I guess I'm still not use to schooling again after close to 8 months of slacking and enjoying life without school. I  need  my sleep and I  want  my sleep!   I'm back to hearing X Japan songs. After  Tears  kept playing in Windstruck, I started missing X Japan songs. They are a  good  band, wonderful music, especially the drums and guitar parts. Their english is horrible, but then... they are a Japanese band, oh well. If only hide didnt pass away in '98, then we could be still hearing good music as Yoshiki had wanted to "revive" another X in 2000. Damn.  Currenly playing: Tears - X Japan

      So happy that leeds won their first match of the division one season against Derby. Its a good start for them, especially with 7 players playing their debuts for leeds. Leeds went through hell last season - bad debts, relagation, lost of their best players. Hopefully, they can pick up the broken pieces of last season and bring leeds back to glory days in time to come. And then maybe   alan smith   will go back to leeds :)!  Went to the opening of my cousin's hair salon today. Nice design he has for the shop, very zen! So got to catch up with my cousins today during the opening. Being in such a big family, its hard to talk to all my relatives.. so gatherings are always very good time to catch up! So, because of this, i missed going out to sentosa with my ti tu tiu friends (ac camp ppl). But i guess, you cant have the best of   both   worlds!

      Was suppose to be a fun day going to meet my friends for dinner and to meet two other friends to play pool before that. But....like   always  , the dinner got cancelled - dont make me say why.  Then i started to feel giddy and had a bad stomachache, so i couldnt meet my 2 other friends for pool. So sorry, didnt want it to be that way too. And i stayed at home the  whoooooollllleeeee  day.  So what was suppose to be a fun day, turned out horrible. period.

      Finished my 2nd, which is also my last term test paper today - travel geography. For not studying from chapter 4 onwards, i think it was quite good, 42/50. *grins* I did the "eini-mini-more" method for a couple of questions, and it worked for some questions! Most answers came from my travelling experiences, esp all those questions on Australia and America!   Im glad that the term tests have all ended. BUT, im still stuck with all my projects, another project discussion tmr.... dang..

      I haven't been blogging for a while.. no mood. haha  Got jay chou's new album yesterday - qi li xiang. This time around, he went for a russian style. After econs paper yesterday, i went with christine, crystal, boon and kelly to get the CD. So happy! Waited one year for it!  But.. it isnt as good as I expected. Maybe my expectations are too high? hee. But ya.. kind of disappointed. The album has less R&B, less songs which style are like dui bu qi (fantasy) and tong yi zhong diao diao (ye hui mei). Some songs are so similar to his other songs.. the 1st song, wo de di pan, reminds me so much of san nian er ban (yhm) and jiang jun is so much like the song he wrote for jolin, hai dao. His ballads in qlx are just so-so, they are far from the standard of An Jing, Kai Bu Liao Kou, Long Juan Feng and Hui Dao Guo Qu. Interestingly, Vivian Hsu didnt write any lyrics for this album of his... Lyrics were mainly from vincent fang (duh!), and geng hong wrote one for Jay too.  I like Qi Li Xiang (track 2) though, sounds unique and has a style of its own. Yuan You Hui (track 9) also sounds great, very "bright", "fresh" and "cheerful". Track 10 seems to be the only rap song i like so far, hope the more i listen to qlx, the more I'll enjoy it.  Fantasy is still my favourite album ^-^!
