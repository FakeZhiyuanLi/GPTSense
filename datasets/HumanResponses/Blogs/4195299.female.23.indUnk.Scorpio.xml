       I don't understand women, and being one makes it even more confusing. Let's do a hypothetical situation (ok we all know it's really not but work with me here). There is this girl we'll call her D. D has got a lot going for her, she loves life, she is fairly pretty, has a good job, she's just come out of the closet, and has just met a very amazing woman. Enter (we'll call her K) K. K is a girl who lives on top of the world. Very ambitious, grabs the bulls balls, and never takes no for an answer. She is everything D wants in a woman. But ( the famous But) they are suppose to be just friends. Until one day D realizes K is the only person for her. D proceeds to tell K and everything seems to go quite well. But over the next few months nothing happens. Time goes by and K finds a girlfriend, who is not D. Ok now D does not understand. K knows how D feels and yet just strings her along and just plays with her emotions. This goes on for awhile, and they get a little closer and then pull away blah blah blah. Things between them get rocky because of K's worse half (we'll call her S). So they stop talking and hanging out. Nothing really ever happens. Now a year and a half later, D and K have both grown up a bit and are both single. D's friends don't think she should be involved with K at all because before, K hurt D bad and used her and took her for granted. K doesn't really know what she wants. But D wants to help her and take care of her, no matter what. The past is done, you can't change it, D has forgiven K for breaking her heart and I think K has done the same. D wants to try again.       So what should I do?

       another day another dollar. Is that how it has to work, or do we just except that because that's how life has been for hundreds of years? No one should have to life like that. If it's your choice to do the same old same old, then fine. But take a wild ride with a crazy friend some time and do something differant. Love a ton of people and get your heart broke, and break a few your self. I am that crazy friend to everyone I know. But they are the ones that make my life interesting. It's actually quit a neat trade off, almost like a perfect relationship with your exact oppisit. They help bring me down to earth a bit and I take them on a few crazy rides.       Music is my life and every single song I have written is about Love. So more over Love is my live. I love people, and I love getting attached. Although it does hurt more when you loose someone. Scorpio is not really a sign of love ( I know, you are thinking sexnot love) but the posesivness and determination and inner intensity makes normal love for a scorpio multiply X 10. I have no significant other right now but the friends I do have combined keep me in full check. I am a hard persom to keep track of. Maybe that's why I haven't been able to have a relationship. I almost had one, but we both screwed shit up. I took a month off from her, knowing that that's all I needed to get over her. I should have remembered  I'm blond and I really don't knowing that much. It didn't work. And that's a scorpio's intense love for ya. I can't help it. I don't know anything else, being attached, loving, taking care of the ones close to me. Beyond that I'm lost!   another day, another crazy friend, another dollar, another wild ride      mix it up
