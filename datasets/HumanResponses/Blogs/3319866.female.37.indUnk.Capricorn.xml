						                                  Life Is  The hardest thing about life is living it. The worst thing about life is giving it up… Is life supposed to cause you so much hardship and pain? Or is it a test? I feel that I am failing miserably. If Life is what you make it then why can't I make my life better?  I have been trying...But my life is a poor substitute for reality. My reality is a life of heartache and pain... The more I try to change it...The more it stays the same.  And all I can do is sit back and wonder why... For the sake of my kids I struggle to survive... But I am slowly slipping...sliding...drifting...drowning... The Life Jacket has a hole in it...What am I to do now?  Keep plowing on I guess, some way some how. For all the people that I have help over the years have turned their backs on me. I am all alone.  Who can I go to for just a little bit? Why do yall all run...or criticize...or purposely hurt me just to see me cry. I am all alone. Life is something that I have to figure out on my own...I guess... No one to hold my hand when I fall....You are on your own now big girl.... You are all alone...  Make the best of it they say...be a bitch if you have to... But I cant, because that is not who I am...  Life Is.............. Kimberly A Williams ©

						   Looking out on this world of desperation, watching day turn into night.  Looking at my Children' faces i often wonder,  when will everything be alright?  For this world is ever-changing,  Not for the better I say, What am I going to tell my children 'bout tomorrow, right now, today?  Hatred is so rampant in this world of ours,  People forgot how to love. Forgot how to give. Forgot how to help. Forgot how to live.  Life used to be so easy.  Family was more than just a word.. Lift you brother up and help him through his time of struggle.  Lift your sister up, and give her a plan.  Stop tearing down, start building up Before its too late, my friend.  Each one of us, must teach one of us strength in numbers, supply and demand...  I am struggling i am your sister...but who will give me a hand?  i wonder...   Kimberly A. Williams ©

						   What do you think about me. Am I wonderful? Am I bad?  Am I the best you ever had? Am I strong? Am I gifted?  Do I warrant your attention? or am I just another notch among many? Do I have merit, or worth? Do I have the strength to tell you its done? Over, Finished, gone...  What do you really think about Me. Tell me.  Kimberly A Williams©
