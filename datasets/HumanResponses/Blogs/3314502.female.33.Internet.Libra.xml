      ze frank has a  urlLink new movie  circulating and when i checked  urlLink his site  i was reminded of some old stuff that i absolutely must share.  the first one i ever saw was  urlLink "how to dance properly" , and i highly recommend your studying it carefully if you're coming to my housewarming.

      it's 12:39 a.m. and i'm still at work.  must be back for a 9:00 a.m.  i'm too tired to be annoyed anymore.  i miss those golden days when working late meant free (for me) sushi and car services after 8 p.m. not that i ever took advantage or anything (oh look!  it's 8:02, guess i can go home now.  thanks IBM!!!). notwithstanding and fully cognizant of how those "excesses" were rapidly bringing about the dot-com crash of 2000.  no more of that.    1:36 and out into the thunderstorm i go.  i hope i can sleep.   can't sleep.  the few lost souls on the A train were sleeping and those on the L reeked of alcohol and spoke european languages i'm too spaced out to identify.  having a beer, knowing full well those emtpy carbs floating around aren't going to help.

      showcasing ridiculously good, imaginative flash animation,  urlLink presstube  makes me think i'm gonnna buy a flash book.   everything in the archives is worth a look.    watched the 1988 version of  the vanishing  tonight, directed by george sluizer.  really good movie, proves you gotta watch out for those science teachers, they're shady.  i am sensing another trend in the films that keep finding me, but i can't expound upon that for good reaon...  next up,  insomnia , directed  by erik skjoldbjaerg.  i have high hopes for this one too...  lastly, iFILMS always has good shit. but today as i was watching the excellent schneider TM video for a smiths' cover they call  urlLink THE LIGHT 3000 , i noticed a link to an "X rated" AIR video for  urlLink cherry blossom girl .  adults over 18 only.

      i put a  urlLink nice, cushy clayton marcus armchair  out on the sidewalk sunday afternoon thinking for sure someone would scavenge it within 5 minutes, the way things used to happen in williamsburg.  that night around 11 it was still sitting there with fresh pigeon shit splattered on it.  when i got home from work this evening, someone had made off with the seat cushion, peed on it, and taken a knife to it.  and it got rained on.  it really confused me, like, everyone's too good to take it home, but not so civilized they can't slash it with a knife.  so, i'm trying to figure out what else i can put outside and monitor it's destruction via webcam.  this could become an obsession.  postscript to aging williamsburg hipsters:  don't skateboard.  you look like idiots, most of you suck and you're going to get killed.  just ride a low-rider bycicle like normal people in brooklyn.

      i was NOT expecting to revisit pantysplash 2000 tonight, but after a torturous day of moving, what a welcome surprise it was!  i forgot my camera, but normally, everyone has a camera at these zentropy gatherings.  tonight, nothing, save one videophone recording that won't be posted.  what an oversight.

      great britain has a stem cell bank and we have george bush.  this is my proposal for coping with a host of degenerative diseases.  have lots and lots of babies.  save the placenta and dispense amongst several tupperware popsicle containers.  place in the freezer.  when you're feeling old and demented, ("pa, i can't find my keys...") reach into the freezer and take one out.  lick it, you'll feel better.  ignore the overpopulation problem.

      if you are really seriously interested in burning yourself, try some dave's gourmet insanity sauce, a product of some hippie gringo named dave in costa rica.  i ate some mixed with pico de gallo about 20 minutes ago and i'm still sweating, my face is soaked with tears, my glasses keep fogging up and i'm filling a garbage can with snotrags.  i would imagine this compares with  urlLink self-trepanation  on a masochistic level.

      the guy who created the “sarah” starship tribute site to his daughter obviously decided to stop maintaining it in 1998.  Really twisted.  I didn’t make this up.  It’s fucked up.  Look at the counter.  Jesus.  the toaster effects he obviously labored over.  she ages nothing over the course of the tribute.   and he sings “hurt me!” over montages of his prepubescent daughter.  whoever posted this should be arrested.

      this morning as i walked to work after moving my car for alternate side street cleaning (attempting to avoid ticket #6), i experienced a once in a lifetime treat that had me giggling all the way to the train.  as i approached the construction site at the SW corner of N1 and berry, a man who resembled exactly the Jesus (see john turturro,  the big lebowski ) was belting out  urlLink “sarah” , a starship ballad that at one point was a favorite shower song of mine.  he swayed back and forth across the sidewalk while i considered moving to the other side of the street to avoid him.  however i stopped transfixed when his serenade took the form of a starship medley, suddenly switching to an even louder a capella rendition of “we built this city.”  he altered the key and inverted the chord structure of the chorus and the results were shocking.  i’d never really thought about how the worst song ever could be made that much worse but this guy did a masterful job.  not only did he clearly feel really passionately about this song, he owned it.  i wish i could sing it for you.  if you are in the bedford avenue area in the mornings, listen out for this guy.  next time I’m making a request, wonder if he knows “jane?”

      Eternal Life  Jeff Buckley   Eternal Life is now on my trail  Got my red glitter coffin, man, just need one last nail  While all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish games  there's a flaming red horizon that screams our names  And as your fantasies are broken in two  Did you really think this bloody road  would pave the way for you?  You better turn around  and blow your kiss hello to life eternal, angel   Racist everyman, what have you done?  Man, you've made a killer of your unborn son...  Crown my fear your king at the point of a gun  All I want to do is love everyone...   And as your fantasies are broken in two  did you really think this bloody road  would pave the way for you?  You better turn around  and blow your kiss hello to life eternal   Oh...   There's no time for hatred, only questions  Where is love, where is happiness, what is Life,  where is peace?   When will I find the strength to bring me release?  And tell me where is the love in what your prophet has said?  Man, It sounds to me just like a prison for the walking dead  And I've got a message for you and your twisted hell  You better turn around and blow your kiss goodbye  to life eternal angel...  Angel...

      after a long day of intense, interactive whip-cracking, i decided it was time to reward myself.  i've spent the last several evenings actually cooking, and figured tonight i nosh on something fattening and cold.  i checked out the bedford cheese shop in the bedford mini mall recommended to me by my dear pal justin.    the extremely helpful clerks directed me towards the mousse royale (duck liver, pork liver, wine and herbs), pleasant ridge reserve cheese (dry, sharp and american) and cornichons (always a favorite).  i wandered across to the new wine shop and sampled a few wines including a stellar dry rose but settled upon the austrian hiedler gr&#168;uner veltiner 2003, made with grapes "that rival the finest grapes in the world,"  the reisling.  i don't know about that, but it sure tastes nice on this hot pre-summer night in the burg.  am i elated to be back in new york?  fuck yes.  the only thing lacking here is a worthy man.  note the paraphrased adina howard reference in the title.  i can really relate to her.  i, too, want a roughneck brother that can satisfy me.  perhaps it's my attitude.

      welcome to my very first blog.  let's get to it then.  i woke up early expecting to move my shit out of a storage unit in the ass end of brooklyn into my williamsburg palace.  carl, the man with the van, arrived at the unit early and punked out on me when he learned i was stuck in traffic.  but that was ok, as when i arrived home the cable guys showed up early, and internet access trumps my crappy furniture, although i want my books. i think i made the mistake of storing some nice, relatively rare books in a rat and mildew infested storage space.  so i spent the bulk of my day napping, eating and IMing.  i cooked arugula salad, baked jerk chicken and rice pilaf.  les stopped by for a few and tried to drag me out but my head hurts from my ice cream lunch.  so i watched the remaining 4 of 6 episodes of the office season 2, highly recommended.  make sure to watch the episodes through the credits.  other movies watched over the last 10 days:  -lost in translation.  i could quite possibly have fallen in love with bill murray too.  -spellbound.  not hitchcock, but intense kids gunning for the national spelling bee.  quite good.  will reinforce your underachiever status.    -the magdelene sisters.  really fucked up, but i'm irish and my mother has described the laundry prisons (she was never an inmate) so i was expecting it to be worse.  especially good documentary on bonus dvd showcasing women who actually suffered through that shit. i have the feeling if i had lived in ireland during the mid 20th century my ass would have been locked up in an irish laundry prison as well.  -zoolander.  yes, i'm going to buy the dvd.  i haven't laughed that much since wet hot american summer.  one of the best orgy scenes ever.  -kill bill 1 & 2.  kill bill 2 bootleg copy.  i AM the bride.  all i need is a Hattori Hanzo sword.  -about a boy.  i have been listening to the soundtrack nonstop for 6 months.  the movie does it justice.  -the office seasons 1 & 2.  brilliant.  currently listening to original music tracks my friend mike is posting for me.  james taylor better watch his back.  so there it is.  bring on the chirping crickets.  night night.

      you know how it feels standing in a subway station at 3 o' clock in the morning under flourescent lights.  i feel that way now, 10 miles away from seattle, in redmond, washington, close enough to the real world that it makes me very anxious.  if someone asked me how it is here i would say it sucks, this entire complex is a shopping mall where i feel like i am a kid again and i want to break all the windows. it's too bad cause i have such a nice hotel room with an efficiency kitchen and a tv that won't turn towards the bed or the couch but i do have a view of the pool. i could really seduce somebody here. i have slept a total of 7 hours in the last 2 days.

      my friend and i wandered williamsburg last night, and discovered amongst the 20 new restaurants that have popped up along a 2 block strip of N6th, a complex called  urlLink Tacu Tacu Rice Republic . adjoining open air spaces, like everyplace else in the burg now, with the requisite water sculptures (it's neighbor  urlLink galapagos  established that trend), giant fishtanks, more shit than you can look at.  but the food and drinks were CHEAP (yuuuumy leechee martinis) and we shared a red snapper ceviche so good we wanted to drink the juice off the plate. the sweet, extremely accommodating vietnamese owner excitedly informed us it had been written up in the new york times, and did we know, there is a karaoke bar downstairs!  so after our meal we were anxious to check that out, and it's pretty swank.  unfortunately some musclebound mouth breather was screaming paradise city and we ran away fast.  too bad the wrong crowd i.e fucking fratboys have already ruined a perfectly great idea for the neighborhood.  i'll take little korea any day, unless someone out there is interested in helping me form a coup...

      yesterday was the 12th anniversary of my father's death.  that, and other weird shit, have been affecting my dreams all week, i think it even had something to do with poco making a guest appearance.  i would post them but i don't think i'm ready to submit to blogspot dream analysis...  post a comment if you want to read some of it. i haven't had dreams this vivid in ages, and it's cool, except for the unsettling hangovers they can give me.  it's been an all-around strange week and i don't think i've seen the end of it.    i can't listen to get closer by seals & croft anymore.  he's starting to sound like phil collins - yeeuck.  MY mix of seventies songs hits the mail tomorrow.  fucking brace yourselves.  as bad as it is, advance copies have been ordered.  what my boss had to say about my track listing: "hot, hot, hot. Oh yeah.  These will make for some good games of name that tune at home."  i just know my boss is going to do it to my mix.  lyrical samplings:  Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man Yeah gave me peace of mind my daddy never had  WHAT?  i mean, i know elton's gay and all but i had not realized until just now that he professed his love for dick since birth in this song.  I stole behind her in the frozen foods. And I touched her on the sleeve. She didn't recognize the face at first. But then her eyes flew open wide. She went to hug me and she spilled her purse. And we laughed until we cried. We took her groceries to the checkout stand. The food was totalled up and bagged. We stood there lost in our embarrassment. As the conversation dragged.  banal, but yet not. so painfully pussy it has to be real.   think i'll freak kitty out with my new sword.  kitty just wants to fetch.  over and over and over

      radiohead totally stole chord for chord the guitar bridge from al stewarts "time passages" in their song "bones." great radiohead song, and for good reason.  "fake plastic trees" sounds eerily like bread in places. nevertheless, the bends is a really good album, ok computer is...ok.    how fucked up in a good way is this?:  On a morning from a Bogart movie In a country where they turn back time You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre Contemplating a crime She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running Like a watercolour in the rain Don't bother asking for explanations She'll just tell you that she came In the year of the cat She doesn't give you time for questions As she locks up your arm in hers And you follow 'till your sense of which direction Completely disappears By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls There's a hidden door she leads you to These days, she says, I feel my life Just like a river running through The year of the cat Well, she looks at you so cooly And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea She comes in incense and patchouli So you take her, to find what's waiting inside The year of the cat Well, morning comes and you're still with her And the bus and the tourists are gone And you've thrown away the choice and lost your ticket So you have to stay on But the drum-beat strains of the night remain In the rhythm of the new-born day You know sometime you're bound to leave her But for now you're going to stay In the year of the cat

      okay, tired and hungover, but must mention movies recently watched:  capturing the friedmans - way creepy, mesmerizing.  a must see. pirates of the carribbean - pretty good.  too fucking long. school of rock - awesome, i feel love for jack black, which may lower my cred: fuck you. the kids are great.  in america - GOOD FUCKING MOVIE.  however, irish immigrants would never land an apartment like that in new york, i don't care if it is hell's kitchen. special surprise in a featured song that sam and i discussed torturing sean with tomorrow.  (warning nazi, watch your ass.) american splendor - yay! gooood movie. "ron" from wet hot american summer has a role.   more good-bad 70s and 80s songs.  due up tomorrow: morvern callar

      i  urlLink wholeheartedly agree , i'm so  urlLink glad   urlLink the bastard's  gone.   What I Owe Ronald Reagan The Brylcreemed Bullshitter By BEN TRIPP  In 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected president of the United States. I was 14. He was just some old Brylcreemed bullshitter from California, and remained that way until 1986.  Then we all found out that steely glitter in his eyes, which might just have been glaucoma, was for real: Gramps was a killer. This was a guy who, for purely ideological reasons, would mix Iranian extremists with Nicaraguan rebels. A combination similar in volatility to nitric acid and glycerine. It woke me up.  I owe him this: Ronald Reagan made me the scratchy, anarchistic malcontent I am today. Without his influence I might have subsided into the decent-minded futility of the party-line Democrat. It took the Great Communicator to communicate to me the real message of the modern conservative: fuck you.  So here's to Ronald Reagan, our fortieth president, on the occasion of your passing from this life: fuck you back.

      upon closer analysis of the lyrics of "sundown" i am convinced that this is a revealing tale of his issues with his bottom status in a strap-on assrape power struggle. i believe he teeters between dreading and digging it. this would elevate him to a pussy status of 5, cause the repercussions of this could be dangerous.  i believe that "carefree highway" laments the loss of his prior status as an anal virgin. it's really touching.

      last night kitty was supposed to have a slumber party with her lesbian lover-cat, sita, the point being to keep her indoors while my shindig was in progress.  when i went to collect her, we turned becca's apartment upside down but she was nowhere in sight, and sita was saying nothing.  i walked back out to check the street and she came running up to me more bug-eyed than usual. she had jumped from a second story window to have a little clinton hill adventure.  now everyone knows there is nothing a cat loves more than a nice relaxing bubble bath. so as punishment, kitty got one.  if you think she looks small dry you should see her wet.   urlLink here she is , ravenous after a long night on the prowl. and  urlLink here she is  after i administered a little tough love.  it always hurts me more than it hurts her to do  urlLink this , but kitty's going to learn that roaming the streets of brooklyn is not cool with mommy.  that's my thrill-seeking baby, i wonder who she learned that from...  she smells pretty.

      i'd like to thank all those who attended my "you're gonna hate me party" for coming hungry and making it a smashing success.  i received a variety of death threats from my friends, as expected. becca levine worked the grill like a pro when all i could do was walk in circles.  the horse-dick pork was succulent, and will definitely become a BBQ mainstay, a real crowd pleaser.  you may have mocked/gawked at it but you ate five pounds of it.  nobody died, but  urlLink fred came close . that habenero stuffed olive he accidentally ingested put him down, i felt kinda bad, i forgot to mark dangerous food items with a skull & crossbones, next time...  we tucked him into the waster nook under the stairs and he's recovering nicely. an extra special THANK YOU to mother nature for keeping things dry until about 6 o clock this morning, which allowed for a couple of extra hours of  urlLink williamsburg party hopping .  these little gatherings may become at least a biweekly event, there's enough booze left here to do it again next week...  at 4:30 this morning, matt, sam and i discussed a brilliant idea for when the assholes come to NYC for the RNC this september.  everyone, take to the streets, hang out your windows and congregate on your rooftops.  chant "FUCK YOU GEORGE BUSH!!!" over and over and over.  blow it out your amps, broadcast it on your webcams, unfurl your banners, project it onto the sides of buildings, hire a plane to write it in the sky, confetti it down all over the city, the methods of expression  here are endless, and they can't stop it, but it will be interesting to watch them try.  they'll hear that shit in the hamptons.  we'll keep it up until con-ed shuts the city's power down or black helicopters blanket the 5 boroughs with a cloud of sleeping gas.  website to come...

      this would refer to the very special softrockrocks cd sean sent me.  gotta smoke at least a lid of grass for this one.  song listing with notes:  make it with you - bread (pussylords, a solid 10 on pussy scale) without you - harry nilson (painful, listen carefully you can hear him stringing up his noose. 10+++) tin man - america (points for conceptual profundity, complex vocal stylings, plus they never mention a chick. 7)  baby i'm a want you - bread (see above) it don't matter to me - bread (see above) let your love flow - the bellamy brothers (confident, rockin. these guys just want to puff a doob and get the orgy going ("all livin things," baby...). can't pussy rate it.) i'd really love to see you tonight - england dan and john ford coley(cheesy casual conversational tone, lyrics tossed about in nonchalant manner, still reeks of desperation.  points since greatest american hero theme song aped it.  9) sad eyes - robert john (who's sad eyes? 9) just when i needed you most - randy vermermermermen (wrist slasher, might be the pussiest song ever. bet he's still stalking her. 10+++) reminiscing - little river band (behold, the power of cheese.  pussy masquerading as swagger, throws the scales a bit. references another cheesy band ("miller's band??") 9.5) get closer - seals and crofts (a powerful duet, hence the pussiness balances out. simple, direct lyrics. 8) sundown - gordon lightfoot (what a stoner this guy had to be. extra points for kinky/drug implications. he threatens her ("if i find you been creeping round my backstairs..."). looks like a  urlLink serial killer . i can't really qualify gordon as a pussy.) carefree highway - gordon lightfoot (wanderlust, yeah. i love the highway as analogous to the vagina. smooth. scared of gordon, even though he's canadian. not a pussy.) sister golden hair - america (this song shocked me as a child cause he said "damn." admits to depression, that's a start. he begs. 10) lady - little river band (i love how he behooves her to "look up, look around," if someone wrote this song for me i'd be utterly confused. he coyly admits that MAYBE he wants her. a childhood fave, so it must be pussy.  9) everything i own - bread (barf. as a child i was a bit disturbed by how much more pussy they were than me at 6. complete tools. 10+++) we just disagree - dave mason (well i'm certainly not going to force the issue then. cop out. 10) ventura highway - america (funky enough for janet jackson. this song made me feel like i knew what it  was like to smoke some good old northern cali. another highway as vagina metaphor. 7) whenever i call you friend - kenny loggins, stevie nicks ("I know forever we'll be doin' it??"  sounds like they're what the kids these days are calling "friends with benefits." kenny is a master pussy. 8) you are the woman - firefall (the addition of this track totally makes up for the fact that the first time sean sent me this CD it was blank. SWEET flute intro - kinky! 10)  nice work.

Sean said:  "Why Anastasia screamed."   Sam said:  "Wow, and I thought George Bush was the biggest dick I'd ever see"  "I think I am going to have leg of lamb for dinner"  "Holy shit! I can't believe I have only slept with one man in my whole life..."  &nbsp;  Nathan said:  "To great fanfare, the new Mad Monk Martini is unveiled."    oh yes, and i have upgraded the first runner up prize to a complete 3-disk set of seventies soft-pussy rock, of which 2 disks are the work of a non-competing fellow blogger.

       urlLink the weather underground  - documentary produced by the Free History Project, san fran.  the  urlLink reverend billy  gave a delightful rant at the independence day festivities i attended, and the mantra that really whipped up the crowd was "music! sex! direct political action!" i am sure the weather underground would agree, but i wonder if they would consider this movement, essentially art as protest, direct political action. yes, we talk and we vote, but i can't think of anyone willing to put their life on the line. someone recently told me i reminded them of bernandine dohrn, which i took as a total compliment, but unlike her i am not a total badass. i give the orgy scene a 4. young dustin hoffman in suspicious cameo. i wonder if netflix /blogspot has turned my name over to the FBI yet...(female meltdowns: 0)  urlLink nights of cabiria  - fellini. aging, emotionally fragile, european hos has been thematic for me lately (see all about my mother, 8 1/2). indeed, this film was cathartic, beautiful, layered, poignant and trippy. reminded me that i love italy and need to get back there someday. and that i'm not really a ho. (female meltdowns: not including the madonna scene, 1.5)  urlLink 3 women  - robert altman. showcases a lot of my favorite foods. gonna purchase this one. (female meltdowns: 3)  urlLink nashville  - robert altman. lots of great music, pussy singer-songwriters notwithstanding. he needed to cut the number of "relevant" characters in half and keep it at it's current time (160 m) to get into any character development, but ok that's not the point. as a child i would watch bizarro nashville music programs on tv, and think to myself that everyone in nashville was crazy. he captured that. (female meltdowns: too many to keep count, but 2 are superb)  urlLink all about my mother  - almodovar. plenty of the usual almodovar melodrama.  relatively subtle in raunch department. well performed by all the women, but his obsession with transvestites is becoming a bit played (see fellini's nights of cabiria). (female meltdowns: 3 women, 2 transvestites)  urlLink 24 hour party people  - michael winterbottom. made me nostalgic for 1988 / 1991 wee-hour wanderings of dublin's sidestreets seeking parties. (female meltdowns: just ian curtis)  urlLink lord of the rings, return of the king  - i made it through the trilogy, not sure why i was so determined to do so. oh yes, viggo mortenson. (female meltdowns: .5)  urlLink the incredibly true adventure of 2 girls in love  - sweet, funny, cute. at my age it feels weird watching steamy "teen" action, even with the bad 1994 fashion and riot grrl music that makes them as old as me. laurel holloman is from chapel hill. (female meltdowns: this movie is too campy for any real meltdowns)  urlLink morvern callar  - lynne ramsay. i came away from this one feeling dirty, the feeling i get under the flourescent subway lights late at night or back in dublin 1991. (female meltdowns: 1)  urlLink mystic river  - poor tim robbins is no stranger to assrape in film (see shawshank redemption), and getting royally fucked over when he shouldn't be. here we have, again, evidence that assrape does occur north of the mason dixon. kevin bacon plays another cop, and i like sean penn better when he makes me laugh (see dead man walking, fast times at ridgemont high). (female meltdowns: 3 incl. tim robbins)  total female meltdowns: 15+  next up:  8 1/2 - fellini trash - paul morrisey sextette - ken hughes, starring mae west
