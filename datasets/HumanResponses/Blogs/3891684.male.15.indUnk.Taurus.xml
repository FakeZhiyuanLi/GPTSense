      I really don't know. This move... the curricula in Israel are much different than those in the US. Everything seemed to be fine, because I'm kind-of doing well with Latin, and I wasn't supposed to have any problems with science - but now I saw some presentations in websites of teachers in the school I'll study in, and it seems that I'll just lose it. I don't know whether it'll happen or not, but I'm really afraid.   Latin:  I don't even know what book I'll study from there. Meanwhile I'm learning according to Wheelock's Latin, but that might not be enough.   Science:  in Freshmen Physical Science they study a lot more than I studied here. I know that with, say, a week of intensive lessons (with a teacher) I could cover most of the subjects, at least partly - but I really don't know if I'll be given the chance. I want to be in Chemistry Honours next year, but this requires a recommendation from the science teacher of year 9, plus a project (that includes a presentation). My spoken English is kind of a shame.  An e-mail to the school with a gentle, implicit request to see the syllabi was gently, implicitly refused. This lack of certainity, of knowledge what next year is going to be like drives me mad. I know I have the potential to be a better-than-average student, but I doubt I'll be one.  [During the time in which I wrote this post I was afraid I'll seem like a show-off. This certainly wasn't my intention. The nature of the subject forced me to speak so of myself, and I will try to avoid such writing in the future...]

      I never know what to write in my first post when I open a new blog. I'm quite afraid to be read by people who know me, so I've opened some now-deleted blogs in the past. This time I thought I might be cleverer, and write the blog in a language that is foreign to most of my friends.  So that's me. I am a 15 years old guy from Israel (English being not my first language, please forgive any weird phrasings or grammatical/spelling mistakes). In less than 3 weeks my family and I will move to the United States for three years. I am usually thought of as strange, as I adore maths and languages. Plus, most of the friends I have are from a well-known portal in my country. I have participated in message boards there for some year and a half now, and since then I've changed much, so most of my classmates know the one I were better than the one I am.  I'm also addicted to harpsichords (I just love music of the Renaissance/Baroque) and to computers (programming fascinates me). History interests me too - just let it be Mediaeval or Classical (I currently study Latin, and I plan to study some 8 other languages).  I think that'll do for now. Thanks for reading!

      So we're here for almost two weeks now. How much I missed this computer...  my  computer (for the past two months I was either on my brother's computer - which was used as the public computer, or my father's laptop [but that was for a short while only]).  I found that I can communicate rather well, at least compared to what I feared. I still try to avoid speaking :-P Tomorrow there'll be the meeting in which my level in English will be formally determined. The meeting at school was scheduled to the end of this month. I was mad at first. I really really hope I'll be let into Chemistry.  Now comes another part of my life. There was a girl I first-met three times. Sounds impossible, right? We both participated in a kind of Summer activity between years 4 and 5 and were in the same sub-course in it. Then we studied Maths together. We also had the same Piano teacher, and she - without knowing we were studying together - organised 4-hands lessons for the two of us. Well, how can one tell how he fell in love? I wanted to tell her before my flight here, but I never had the courage to. I never will, it seems. I am more and more determined every time that I should tell her, but I just can't do it. Maybe an e-mail or an offline message will do better... The thing is, being perfectionist (and kind-of afraid of failure) is one of my characteristics. I can never be spontaneous, always think what the others will think about everything I do. It kills me sometimes, but I just can't overcome it.  And then there are the friends I love so much: I've got a strange feeling that they don't understand that I  really  love them, every single one of them (differently from what I stated above, of course, but then not that much different...). The 7-hour difference is too much.  I listened to most songs in my collection today, and I found some songs that explain so beautifully what I feel...  Unfortunately, I can't recall what their names were :P
