      Hello, I have decided it cannot be without affecting MY LIFE. Why are people so selfish, condensending, stupid,and greedy? Doesn't everyone just realize that their is a better way to life that just isn't about them and involves everyone. You all suck and you know who you are: the person that cut me off this morning, the person that just tore down a building that housed 20 low income families. Open your eyes and see it's not all about the money or YOU!!!!!!!!

      I have to say not all truck drivers are bad drivers, it's just the few that dictates the mass. I see more bad driving habits in everyday drivers than all truck drivers put together, incuding the stupid ones.   At what point do you feel that the road is yours to cut off as many people as you wish. With no consideration to anyone else, not even a second glance. You drivers, and you know who you are, cut trucks off the worst.  I have more of a right to the road than you do because i helped build it and so did most of those trucks. So the next time your going to cut a truck off, stop and remember if it wasn't for those trucks, you would be driving on bumpy, potholed, dirt pathes. And you sure as H%#* wouldn't be flying past me doing 102mph

      I have come to the conclusion that the IQ of truck drivers in this city has dropped by 31% since last year. Most people don't know this because they don't have to deal with them day in and day out. I used to get upset at my co-workers for saying stupid truck drivers but in this years reality it is TRUE.The cloak has been lifted from my eyes. Who authorizes these people to drive, especially 17000 kg of cold hard metal with the killing power of a landslide. Do we all have that much of a death wish. Shouldn't there be regulations about how smart someone should be before they put all our lives in jeopardy.   I think the solution starts here. To make this pit safer, every time a driver comes to my window and asks a stupid question, I shall have to kill him. Slowly the stupidity levels will drop off, as drivers go missing. The new drivers that replace the old ones will be to scared to ask stupid questions and do stupid things.   So, the new drivers will have to educate themselves to survive. Therefore they will be safer on the roads and we will all be safer. Which is kind of ironic in it's own sense because i have to put them in danger for us to be safe.

      I have not given any info about ME. I am the lizardqueen. My hobbies are my pets, 2 cats (Isis and Stitch), 5 lizards (Spike, Echo, Phoenix, Apollo, Helamonster). I love to build live vivariums, they are like small eco systems. I love all animals. I have a home that I feel comfortable in. I am sleeping better now, than I have in years, because I feel safe. I have friends that care about me and family that finally treat me like an adult.  I have dreamed of having everything that I have now, and somehow it is not as satifying as I thought it would be.

       Hello again, I have come to realized that my bitterness is getting the best of me. I am just so tired of fixing everyone else's mistakes. I am the youngest in my family but yet I am the savior. Whenever someone has a problem or mess they call me to clean it up. Well, I hate to tell you, but my place is a pig sty. I think it is time I say F&%$ you and I'm going to clean my house. I just have no more energy to clean up after you even though I know I will. I work long, and I work hard just to keep up with all of your bills. So, the paving crew can work as long as they want I have to take the hours.  Way too much money later and a stress headache, they always find some new problem.  Why does it always seem the youngest, is the most responsible, and the biggest sucker of them all.

      Apparently 12 hrs isn't good enough for these guys. They always have to go the extra mile. Who needs a life. What good is spending time with your children or wives or even pets. I can work 14 hours a day.   Wooohoo money, money, money. They are not paving the world slowly but in great leaps and bounds with 14-16 hr shifts at a time. Think of what you could pave over in 16 hrs a day!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I hope all of you can read the sarcasm... because yah I have bills too, but come on people. You know what sucks the worst is, not only do I have to stay here late to keep the pavin' machine moving, when I start to go home I have to put up with THEM PAVING 3 OF MY MAJOR ROADS HOME. My delay will take at least another hour.   The road out front of my house has been chipped for 3 weeks. One block down they paved and forgot our section apparently. Because it still sits there unpaved. The pot holes are becoming big enough to engulf a small car and I have to navigate through it just to reach my parkade.   I have sat in a paving truck and I have come to the conclusion that: the paving crews love puppies...   I know I seem to have a little bitterness, but it is well deserved.   FINISH A PROJECT BEFORE YOU START A NEW ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! STOP MAKING PUPPIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND LET ME GO HOME!!.. it's to nice to sit in here all day.

      I wonder sometimes, what I am missing as a 25 year old. I was driving&nbsp;through Kensington last night and saw people my age out having fun, socializing with there friends, drinking, letting loose, and freeing the stress from the work week. I used to be able to do stuff like that, but now I feel old and tied down.&nbsp; What am&nbsp;I missing? I have no summer "life". My life in the summer consists of working, cleaning my house, taking care of my pets, eating and sleeping. On my odd day off, I might get one night of camping or hiking in, but it seems sooooo monotonous.   It is hard to make friends when all you do is work related and your co-workers are not exactly the savory type, you would like to go out with. I have the perfect example, this is from last year. A driver was hinting that he wanted to get to know me better and tried to invite himself to my Thanksgiving dinner. I was not comfortable with the idea so I said no, after he played on my heart strings by saying he was all alone and it is hard to be all alone on holidays. For me, this issue is a sore spot because I know what it feels like. Note: nobody knows anything about me here so when someone says something like that I acually thought it was heartfelt. I almost considered it until another driver clued me in that the man was married and had a child: in  town. I still gave the first driver the benifit of the doubt and asked him. He came up with some lame excuse and said he wasn't trying to hurt me.  &nbsp;  The point to this story is, this year I found out that that driver went home and cut up his wife soon after. She is in a coma now, with the chance of coming out very slim, and he is in jail.  &nbsp;   So once again it is hard to meet good people, and even harder to know they are good people!   &nbsp;  I have too many responsibilities to go to bars every night and drink, just to meet people like I used to do. I have no money or time to spare for such a temporary high. Is this wrong at my age, or have I just been force into something the rest of you haven't?  &nbsp;  WHERE DO I START MY NEW LIFE AGAIN?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       I heard a few days ago Alberta is the first province to be debt free. Our provincial government pulled it off hey. Now here is my beef, if we are debt free does that mean the money they pulled out of health care, education, and environmental funding, will be replaced? The government says NO, they don't want to go into debt again. We have all been following the news and we see scandals across the front page every day. Liberals scholarship&nbsp;scandal just one to name. So, my question is, is it actually our liberal programs, or or liberal politicians that are putting us in debt. I think it is nothing more than bad money management. I guess when you are dealing with billions of dollars, thousands seem like penny change and inconsequential. But remember, thousands to us low lives who pay for your billions can mean if we can pay our rent or not.     &nbsp;   The homeless rate in Calgary alone, went up 25% this year from last year. I guess that money the government is pissing away could have been rent to every homeless person is Calgary for a a year. It must&nbsp;be in how you view it, from a politicians view of 200,000 wage a year, to a 12,000 minimum wage, single, mother. Who has the more realistic, down to earth viewpoint. Did you know that politicians only have to show up for 216 days of year for that wage, and that this changed&nbsp;from 300, in 2001. But what does that matter because in 2001 they were only getting payed 120,000. I guess they didn't want to lose any money, so they made the days shorter and the wage higher.     &nbsp;   I found out earlier this week that the interest rate on owing money to the government for taxes is 6% + 1%/month. That is&nbsp;outrageous. The banks don't even charge that. This is also from the day it was due, meaning April 1. So even if you do not know, you owe the government money because you file your taxes late, they charge you interest from April 1.     &nbsp;   As for health care, they give you only 3 months to pay in full, before they send you legal documents, which by the way, you pay for the legal fees. Most people don't even get bills before the government is sending the legal papers. After 6 months they garnish wages and once again you pay for the legal fees. On top of all this, you pay a high interest rate on your late payments, that you did not get a bill for. Wow, this just keeps sounding better doesn't it!     &nbsp;   The government wonders why 80% of people live in debt their whole lives. Maybe you should give your people a break once in a while and stop pissing away the money you take for taxes, health care, pension plans. Nothing we do or own, in Canada, has not been taxed or profited off of by our government. With the exception of illegal drugs, and the government wants to start getting a piece of that. That is only reason alcohol and cigarettes are legal, the government saw money signs.     &nbsp;   I don't know about you, but it seems to me that our government is just as corrupt as the next one (USA, Russia). It is all the same, they all come from the same politician pool, and I think the people should rise up and drain that pool.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;
