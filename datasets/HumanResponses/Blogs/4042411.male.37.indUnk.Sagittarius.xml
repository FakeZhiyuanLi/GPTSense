       urlLink    Went for a ride in Auburn last night. I found a short little loop around the Keisel park area, was a great place to ride as there were a couple small hills and I  didn't have to worry about getting too far away in the dark. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Only two photos to post from this weekend. Went for a short ride in Pintlala yesterday and Mary stopped to rescue a turtle that walking over a bridge, she has a thing for turtles. He surely would have been splattered by this big ol tractor that came by as she was saving it. She carried down the woods under the bridge and sat him free next to a mud puddle.&nbsp; urlLink
