         Cool pic huh? I found that one online. That is pretty much how I feel right now. I have no plans for today, basically watching tv and tanning outside....sounds like a blast. So if y'all wanna call me GO FOR IT !!!   I'll leave you with this quote I found:  "We are all just flying around this world in a small plane and there's no room for extra baggage."

      Hey team...I've decided to start this whole little blog thing up again. Hopefully it will be a little different than before. I'll probably include politics and my beliefs which I find myself becoming more interested in by the day. So, if you don't enjoy my thoughts or beliefs than you should probably not read on...but I would hope that you would and not hate because I happen to have different beliefs than you. That has been my BIGGEST problem for about...oh i dunno...a year or more. The people I choose to surround myself with are mainly of a different background and have different beliefs. I am TOTALLY FINE with that. But these people are not. They think they can convert me and argue with me on a daily basis about how wrong my beliefs are. This is why I like this whole blog thing. I can spew my thoughts on topics without people telling me how wrong I am until after they read my entire arguement. So I encourage you...read the entire blog. You don't have to like it or think I am right (think I'm an ass for all I care) but I ask you to do one thing. RESPECT my opinions and beliefs as I respect yours. Don't call me names, or tell me I'm wrong without an arguement to back it up. Some may even find that I know more than I pretend to.  So to begin this blog...here's what I did today. NOTHING! Actually I got up early (10.30) and did nothing but eat. I met Alex downtown to hang out in some social establishments (namely the library and others...). Then as we were walking back (I had one of those bottled frappuccinos) I drank too much and it came out my nose. It was gross, I've never had anything come out my nose before...so that was super cool. heh. Then I came home and tanned for about an hour and a half and to my suprise I was still white when I got done....I'm getting sick of tanning and not getting tan...it may be time to go tanning California style. I love my life. (but I'll meddle on that in another blog...)  So here we go...hopefully I will find myself updating this blog daily this summer...I hope you all have a good night...  Later

      So today was okay...I basically spent it doing errands and just catching up on some stuff. But my day didn't start off too well. I woke up at 9:30 AM!!! The damn FedEx man thought it would be funny to show up at my house, ring the door bell twice! and then knock a ton!!! I was pissed. He wouldn't even just leave the package, he needed the stupid signature. I'm not amused...at all! So me, looking like crap, answers the dumb door gives the guy his damn signature...and then I go back to bed.  After waking up at a more normal time, I tryed to fix my sister's computer again! I had to put a whole new frickin hard drive in it. What a pain in my behind. This stupid computer has been acting up for like the past month. I finally fixed it, after like 5 hours of my labor...I'm not a very happy camper, but its done, fixed, better...finally! I did some other crap and finished packing my suitcase to go to San Francisco. It's full totally full, but its cool. I'm so excited to go tomorrow...Emily's dad is picking me up at like 1 o'clock-ish...we are going to have so much fun! I cannot wait. So no more blogs until next Tuesday, August 3rd...when I will fill you all in about my super fun trip to San Fran.....See ya all in a week!   Good Night Everybody!

      So...I've decided to share with you my super successful outlook on life. You see, hey why is John so damn happy all the time? I don't know either. It's just like that. But lately this is how I've been looking at all the crap that happens in my life...look at life like its a war. It's quite simple. You've got to drop the bombs in the right place at the right time.  I'm thinking of shaking stuff up. Maybe cut off some dead weight. I do that every once in a while. I haven't done it since freshman year. I decide which of my friends I want to continue to be my friends. I got rid of quite a few freshman year, and I couldn't be happier with the results. I really think that it works. Look at every one of your relationships, and decide which of them are going in the direction that you think is right, and which ones contribute positively to your life. Then, you cut off all the rest. It sounds mean, but it really makes ya happier. Maybe, I'll start thinking about this again. Yep....thats cool huh?  In other news, today I did pretty much nothing. What a life huh? I woke up at like eleven, went to IHOP for breakfast/brunch and then did errands which suck, but whatever. Spent like $300 at the grocery store, cause I had no food here! But I bought a ton of Ben & Jerry's Brownie Batter! Best ever!   But on TV, there was footage of the Ronald Reagan funeral, and I got sad all of a sudden. That sucks. Oh well, now I'm watching Cops. That show is a white trash showcase. Hmmm....well one of the things I hate doing is packing. I hate it almost as much as I hate un-packing. But I gotta get ready for San Francisco....one more day! I can't wait, I haven't been on vacation in months! So adios!

      So it was about 97 degrees at my house today....it was hot! So what else do we do when we are hot? We go to the lake to go tubin! So I did! It was tons of fun, the water was pretty choppy today cause of all the boats out on the water, but it was fun! And it was way cooler on the water than well anywhere else. I seriously don't know how people around here live without air conditioning. I am seriously like one of three people in my neighborhood with air conditioning. I couldn't do it. Dead serious. Thats about all I did today .... so now I'm super bored.   I talked to Alex today, she wanted to hang out, but I told her I was busy. So, I guess I'll see her after my trip. Oh yeah, did I mention I'm going to San Francisco with Emmy on Tuesday. That's in three days. Yep, I'm excited. I've never really gone on a trip with just my friends thats unsupervised. I mean we all went to NYC, and DC, and Boston for spring break, but we had like teacher supervision and what not. This trip is all on us. It'll be fun.  I don't really have much else to say for today, seein as I didn't do too much.

      Yea...I did nothing. I woke up early at nine am today, to some unfortunate news. Nobody died, but someone should have. My mom was on the phone at 8 am to this professor guy from this college service that we paid a few years ago to help me get into college and get some $$$ to go with that. He basically said I was doing pretty much everything right, and I was pretty much on track. She has another phone call scheduled for next week so we can go over financing, so I can get some financial aid! Cause I poor and I can't afford college! Anyways he also told my mom that I need to get my SAT scores up. I got a 1270 last time, and they said I need a 1400 to be able to get some decent money. But he did say with my score that I could get into just about any college, the only thing now is the money. He also said my 29 on the ACT was pretty good! So I'm excited, but I have to schedule myself to take the SAT two more times. I'm super excited about that one. I was supposed to take it with Alex, but I'm not gonna wait forever to schedule this one so I'll do it myself. Like last time! Anyways, heres the super un good thing this guy told my mom. That my last name (refer to previous post) should be left as is until I get into a college, where I can easily change it then. I mean it makes sense, but heres whats not cool. Everything I have (my SAT, ACT, and school transcripts) are under my preferred name. So next year I get to be someone else, and graduate as someone else. I'm not excited about this, but maybe my mom can force Ms. Tocar to do things my way. Transcrips in legal name, all other (ie. yearbook, graduation) in preferred name. We'll see, but I'm not too excited. My mom is still gonna talk to the lawyer about it too when she sees her next week. Whatever, I don't care anymore. It's dumb.   Well, today after much arguing over all that crap up there ^^^ I went to Costco and stuff with my mom and sister. We had lunch at the Olive Garden, and now I'm home alone doing nothing. I'm bored, but whatever, I don't care anymore. I also didn't call anybody today, as promised. Two people called me and I talked to them, but whatever. Alex called to say she got a job at Quizno's, and got kinda pissed when I wasn't too happy for her. I guess its just this, cause I don't need to work, I don't understand other people working. Like it wastes all your social time, and I dunno to me the money that you would earn (very little) isn't worth it. But to some people it is. Anyways, I guess its cool that she finally got a job, but whatever...we won't be seeing too much of each other after Monday, when she starts her job. Also, Morgan called me today. We heart Morgan. She's my hero, and had never pissed me off...so that takes a lot. I can't wait to go visit her in San Francisco next week. Emmy and I will have so much fun. So she called and we talked about flights, and what we wanna do while we're there....so that will be cool. It'll be good to get a vacation from all things Washington. I'm tired of it....I never really hated it here except in sixth grade when I got here, but I'm starting to want to go back home again. I want to move back to Cali, or somewhere else. I don't care. Somewhere, I need change, I crave change.   Oh yeah, and within seven days I need to pick out 8-10&nbsp; colleges that I'm interested in for that college service thing. I have like two....yikes! Any suggestions? I'm having caffeine withdrawls, I've only had one iced grande caramel macchiato today....! I'm also really enjoying this 98 degree weather, and my highly air conditioned house. I don't know how people live without it. Well, my mom just got home, I wonder where I'm going for dinner? I don't know. I'll talk with you all later. Good night.

      Tonight was, well it was a night. I went to the show, Godspell. It was amazing, it was great, what more can I say? I met Alex and Emmy and we went downtown to Ramblin' Jacks and we were having a great time. Emmy and Alex decided to go visit their techie friends at another table, and never came back. I felt dumb, or I don't know a good word. ...so I drank a liter of Diet Pepsi from the carafe at the booth by myself for like 25 minutes. After that, I decided they had enough time to come back and talk to me if they actually wanted to, and they didn't. So I left.  I figured I could make better use of my time. Lately I've probably been over analyzing way too many things, and this is one of em. But it kinda like was the last little thing that finally pushed me over. After I left, I drove. I drove for about an hour. With my windows rolled down and my music loud. I drove everywhere. I drove by a lot of peoples houses, I don't know why...I just drove. Then I came home and layed on my floor staring at the ceiling for several minutes. That was just the end of my day. I haven't had a bad day in a long time, and usually a little thing like that doesn't ruin a day for me, but I dunno.  I'm tired. I'm really tired. Of being so nice to people, when they're not nice to me. I'm sick of being John the rich boy who I'd rather not care about..., I'd rather be John the nice boy, or something good like that. I loan people money and don't ask for it back. I give people rides whenever they need it. I wake up early just to go hang out with someone. I don't know what else to do...I'm thinking that I need to just take some time off. Just not try to be social for an entire week. I don't think I can do that. I think I blew this way out of proportion, but I'm depressed, and thats how life goes when you're depressed.  Perhaps I should explain something to everybody, something that most people probably don't see when they meet me or talk to me. I'm actually nice, and I'm actually a human. No matter how much you people like to stereotype me or hate me. I'm a nice guy. I'm not rich, no matter how much you insist I am, I'm not. And just because we have different views on many things doesn't matter, I love you just the same. People around here see me as someone who doesn't care about people. They think I'm some rich Republican a-hole who could care less about everybody else. And while I am a middle-class Californian with some right wing views doesn't mean that I don't respect you for who you are. I'm sick of this crap. I've never shown weakness. I don't like to. That's probably why I get treated differently. I'm not that happy every day of my life. My life is not as easy as I may make it look sometimes. Thats just the way you see it. I don't like you to see it when its bad or unhappy. So I just wont say anything or talk as much. I guess what I'm asking for here today, is for people to understand that I have feelings too. That's all. And like I said...I'm tired. This summer is going to give me a chance to rest and take a break, that's what I'm doing. And in September and I'll be awake, and ready for another year. So I'll update this later, like tomorrow. Good night everybody!

      So I have absolutely nothing worthy of blogging for, but since I'm on here...I'll talk about ... something. Today I woke up late, took my sister to her best friends house (sleep-over time) and then went to Subway to get lunch. On the way to do all of this I waited for 30 minutes to get down the road! I was pissed! The only road from my house to civilization was turned into a one way road today! PISSED! They thought it would be funny to pave the road, which is cool, except for the fact that they did'nt let ya drive on it for 30 minutes! I was not a happy camper....Anyways, this is sort of interesting and worth a thought or four...  Since America is typically represented by an eagle. Saddam should have read up on his Muslim passages.... The following verse is from the Quran (The Islamic Bible) Quran (9:11) - For it is written that a son of Arabia would awaken a fearsome Eagle. The wrath of the Eagle would be felt throughout the land of Allah and, while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced; for the wrath of the Eagle cleansed the lands of Allah; and there was peace.

      Hey girls and boys.... I didn't update yesterday. Sorry :( So yesterday, I woke up at noon and met my mom and sister at Capital High to see Alex's show ... again. I've now seen it twice. Kris got me better seats this time though. 3rd row. But I saw it because she was an understudy and so Sunday matinee was the understudy performance. She was good, everybody was...so that was fun. I hung around afterwards to see the awards cerimony and then hung out with Emmy for a few minutes. So we were talkin and all right and Jeff Kingsbury comes up to me and starts talkin to me...basically he said I should tech a show this summer....heh...Emmy says thats not a good idea and someone might get hurt...but I think I should try it...maybe. But I don't own that much black clothing...so I'd have to go shopping!  Well today, I woke up sooooo early. 8 AM! I know, well Alex and Emily wanted to go to get coffee...in DuPont! Thats like 20 miles from home! I got to be the driver! Lucky me! Anyways the coffee wasn't even that good, but all they did was rave about it before. Anyways, we were half-way to Tacoma, so we decided it would be a good idea to go to the Tacoma Mall. So we did. It was fun, we walked around the entire mall. Good stuff. Then we came home. Emmy went home to sleep and Alex and I hung out for several more hours. It was good times. Then I came home and spent two hours trying to make my sister's computer work, which it finally did....God Bless America. That was my day! Good times huh?!  &nbsp; Well, Here's a little bit of quotage for you.... &nbsp; "I don't get many things right the first time, In fact, I am told that a lot, Now I know all the wrong turns, the stumbles and falls, Brought me here." &nbsp; The story of my life.... Till Later....

      Hey Everybody ... Sorry I haven't gotten around to updating lately. I know you all were wondering what I've been up to ... yeah right ... well here ya go ... so... On Thursday I did some stuff...my sister is back home and we had to go to the high school to drop off a form for the Honors English. So yeah...then since my sister hasn't had any American-ness for three weeks she was dying to spend some of those good ol' Yankee American dollars. So we headed off to the Gap, got sooo much stuff. I did too. It was actually fun. Anyways, later in that day I went to the opening night of Hello Dolly. My best friend Alex was in it, and whole bunches of other people I know. Also, everybody who I know was there, so that was fun. Then I went to Ramblin' Jacks with Alex and everybody after the show and came home late. On Friday, I woke up really late, did nothing for the day and then met my mom and dad so that we could go to Lakefair. Lakefair this year was super dull, like there were the rides and games and all that crap, but for some reason it just didn't seem as much fun. So we were all hungry and we were gonna go eat. But we soon discovered that all the food at Lakefair was served out of like little trailer things and didn't look to be the most sanitary. So my family and I decided that we didn't want to eat out of a trailer so we went to dinner at Red Lobster. It was yummy.  So today, today I woke up late and did some stuff around like clean my room and whatnot. After that we went over to Black Lake where our friend lives. We went out on the boat and went intertubing for like two hours. It was so fun, and I probably got some type of tan. It was awesome, and I had a blast. Too bad the boat ran out of gas so we had to come back in. :( Oh well, then my mom and sister and I went to dinner at Red Robin. It was yummy. My dad is at Lake Tapps with some friends tonight, so its just the three of us tonite.&nbsp; That's all I've got for you folks tointe...till later.

      It's like this ... Why do you have to try to raise hell everytime, even when you know I'm gonna win everytime. Here's the story. I have begun the task of finally seperating from my biological father. Everything is complete except for my name change, which I can legally do when I turn 18 in May. The only problem is college applications (due before May) ask for a full legal name, which would mean I would have to use his name. So the last thing he has that is connected to me or my sister is our last names. He has no visitation, he pays lots of money every month in child support and he has a restraining order against him. But yet he would not say, yea I'll sign the papers. He said nope nope nope. So now instead of just droppin a few papers in the mail for a signature, I get to go to court with an attorney and do all that crap. It's a pain but he should not underestimate me. He thinks I'll be all like "oOo....he said no, so John will just give up and keep my name". This is not funny. I will change my name before school starts one way or another. heh...I just got off the phone with my mom and she hung up on me...cause she said something and I said something back regarding this issue...and apparantly she didn't like what I said...Anyways...I will get what I want, when I want it, just as it has always been. My mom is gonna call the attorney and fix this mess...then I will finally be 100% free. That's my rant for the day, now how about what happened. Today I woke up late, went to the orthodontist's office to check my permanent retainer and then I went to pizza. I met Alex after that and we hung out for a ton of hours, we did everything from getting her hair done, to looking at cell phones...so its been a good day. I love my life, I just hate messy parts of it...no worries, I'll fix this, just as I have every time before. G'nite all.

      Today was okay, my mom and I hung out all day...it was well... a blast. Yesterday my mom started her new job, she kinda likes it. The only problem is that she actually has to work for her money now and she doesn't really like that. But I think the new job is good, especially cause it means mucho dinero!!!$$$ My mom had today off, so I woke up super early and we did stuff like go to the bank and post office...what a life eh? We had lunch at Appleby's, which was good, I hadn't been in there in so long! Then it was off to the airport to pick up my sister who had been in Europe for three weeks. I miss being the only child already! But its cool, I remember when I got back from my three weeks in Australia I matured so much and was a totally different person, which is good. I think she changed a lot too! That's really good, I can already tell shes much more mature, thank God! She brought presents...I got a pretty green sweatshirt from Ireland! She actually has taste...I never knew! And the girl brought more candy than you could think could fit in a suitcase...so John has a supply of British candy like you couldn't believe. But its not as special cause I went to Canada last week and spent $40 on candy there, and its pretty much the same as in England. So yep yep...I'm stocked! Tomorrow, I have to do...well nothing.   Okie...so I am a horrible person and I jacked this from somebody's away message, but it describes me to a tee right now, so I am forgiven for the theft. Here ya go...it is my life as I know it...  Alone  I am alone, so very alone  I hurt, so very bad  I am ignored, just thrown aside  I am security, for others to have  I am lonely, there is no one close, no one sees the pain  I cry, hope is gone  I am alone, and no one knows  Have a good day y'all ...

      I'm really bored ... still! Sorry I didn't write yesterday. I'm a really REALLY bad person. I was at the Portland Airport all day dropping off my grandparents. Well more like afternoon. And well when we got done with that we realized that we still had like a 2 hour drive ahead of us and that we'd never make it without a stop for food shopping and coffee. So what does John and his mom do you might ask? We quickly located Vancouver, Washington (we have like strange intuition for locating shopping malls which include coffee and food and GAP STORES!). So we found it and were starved, after a quick bite to eat at TGI Friday's haven't been there in like 2 months! we headed over to the mall. Where I located the GAP store and bought pants. I needed them, I SWEAR I NEEDED THEM!!! After that we found the Starbucks, and supplied ourselves with some much needed caffiene. Then back to the road! After that I got home ate some food and headed off to Capital High to go see Jane Eyre. A Capital Playhouse production, it was okay. Like it was a good show, but I wasn't impressed. Not to mention it was longer than a XXXXL t-shirt. So after that, AG and I headed over to Red Robin at midnight. I am still mad at Emmy for ditching us...but she'll pay later. Anyways...got home slept ... that was my yesterday. So today...I got up at noon and got dressed by three...does that tell you anything...how about....I DID NOTHING TODAY!I did find time to clean my room, get my car washed, and help my dad do this crap. I also somehow made my sisters computer work. Wow...look at all of those accomplishments. Now I'm going to go watch TV, feel sorry for myself and eat an entire pint of Ben & Jerry's Ice cream...yay! I really should consider convincing the world that I'm clinically depressed & chemically dependant. Now I'm gonna jet. Adios.

      I'm really really bored. There is nothing to do here. There isn't even anything on tv. There is nothing to do. Today I slept in really super late, went to the hospital for a few hours to volunteer (which I haven't done in forever!) and then met AG downtown for about an hour. That was my day, and it was royally boring. Tomorrow I have to wake up at the insane hour of 10.00 AM and drive down to Portland to go take my grandparents to the airport. I'll probably go shopping too! No sales tax yo! Then I'm going to Jane Eyre (sp?), its a play, with Emmy. So that will be fun. Um....yep. OoO...I forgot to share. Emmy and I booked our plane tickets to San Francisco. We are going at the end of this month which is like a little over two weeks away. I'm excited. It'll be fun. I never thought my mom would let me go because you know...I'm traveling with two girls throughout a random city for a week! Yep she let me stay for a week! Not to mention the guy we are staying with is a drag queen. I didn't tell her I was stayin with a gay guy tho...she might flip. I cannot wait. Well, that's all I've got for you today! Okay, so this little thing at the bottom of this entry I found kinda funny...so I'll share it with you... thats it...Later all....  "I'm tired of all this nonsense about beauty being only skin-deep. That's deep enough. What do you want, an adorable pancreas?"  Talk to y'all tomorrow!

      Yikes, so yesterday I went to Canada. Vancouver, BC to be specific. But before Canada lets talk about bees. We have a really big travel trailer in our front driveway. Why you ask? I don't really know either. It used to be in a storage lot, now its in my driveway. Whatever. so, like where the refridgerator (sp?) is in the trailer there is like a vent thing on the outside. So about two weeks ago I noticed yellow jackets going into the trailer. We told my dad and he said he noticed that A MONTH ago but didn't think anything of it. So we call the exterminator and he says there is a HUGE nest in there cause its been a month. So yeah today he came and killed em all. Go Bee Men! Ya gotta heart them!  So back to Canada. This could be a really long blog today, but you all deserve it because I haven't posted a decent blog for a while. So Canada. We woke up at 5.30 in the morning and took off at about 7. I had to do my hair, this is why the delay. Anyways, we finally got up there at like 11 and basically drove right over the border. Apparantly the Canadians don't believe in security at all. The guy was like Hi, *glances at passports*, then says "Have a good trip". Well that was easy. Don't worry, we made up for it coming back into America. More on that in a bit. So the original plan was to spend the night in Vancouver, but as we quickly noticed, Canada sucks! There is nothing to do but shop, and while I can shop for weeks, we decided just to shop for one day. So we left the same day at about 4. Anyways after arriving we quickly located a large shopping mall (Pacific Center) I respelled Center because that is how its spelled. Don't even argue with me on that one. We shopped for several hours. I went to the Gap, which had all the same clothes as in America except it smelled funny. So I quickly left that dump. Then I located the Roots store, which I don't often shop at. I've bought online before, but I bought a sweatshirt. Its very cool. We also went to the pharmacy in Canada. They have Allegra over the counter and 222's. 222's are fun, and illegal. We didn't know that until we tried to cross the border back home when we were informed we were committing a felony. Yikes! Not fun. But everything turned out okay. So if you want the details you gotta ask me. Ummm....so today I did pretty much nothing. Except I had lunch at El Sarape and saw my hair stylist there. She was sitting in the booth right next to us! That is pretty exciting. What else.....I got nothing. So thats all for today kids. Remember that persons's profile I was talking about the other day. Well heres another quote from it. Have a good night all....  "Understand that happiness is not based on possessions, power, or prestige, but on relationships with people you love and respect"  Till Later

      My life is officially the most boring life ever! Today I woke up early to do nothing. I sat around ate Cinnabons and did nothing. Then I went to the mall with my mom and grandparents and bought hair product. Which was by the way the highlight of my day. And that is no good. Well I had a grilled sub at Charley's. I love that place. So then I came home and talked to people online for ever, but it was cool. And then I went out because I was depressed and got some gas in my car cause it was passed the little red mark. Passed the little red mark = NOT GOOD!But then I felt sorry for myself so I ran over to Starbucks and got my Iced Grande Carmel Macchiato and several butterhorns! I love those things, it made my day all better. :) Now I'm online scheduling a hotel for when I go to Canada in two days and an airplane ticket for when I go to San Francisco with Emmy. I can't wait for that trip, it'll be fun. Plus its like the only trip I get to go on this summer. My sister is in frickin Europe and I get to stay home all summer. Yay me! Anyways, I continue to do nothing...and that is not cool. I need social interaction and I have nothing. I feel all lonely and stuff. :( . My parents and grandparents are out gambling again, so I'm all alone. Well, I best be off to do something else...Don't know what yet. I'm off!  So this person's profile is filled with these good like lyrics or whatever. I got todays and yesterdays from this person's profile. Go you! You know who you are! Heres some good lyrics. See y'all tomorrow.  Woke up this morning, jumped out of bed,  Hit my head on a lampshade and the clock said  That I'm running late so I'm rushing  trying to get on my way  Get to my car and the gauge is on E,  Get gas and i pay 2 dollars ninety-three  Got stopped by the cops cause I was speeding  Eighty-nine in a fifty-five Lord, why me  On a day like today,  All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy  Gotta hold on, smile on my face  Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  On a day like today,  Look up at the sky and know life's so amazing  And I know I will be okay  Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way :-D  Later All.

      Hey team! I'm so excited its the fourth of July! No, actually I'm clinically depressed and chemically dependant. I am in such a weird mood today. It could be because I have not seen anybody (my friends that is) in like the past three days! And you all know that I do not do well without any social interaction. I'm dying here people. Then I get phone calls from people hanging out at like midnight, and I should be there! Instead I'm here hanging out with my grandparents. Its cool though, I always said a break would be good for me. I am going to call Emily tomorrow, cause we are going to San Francisco together in like three weeks and we need to book a flight! I'm so excited...that will be so much fun! I'm kind of pissed at my parents right now because they keep making me do all of this crap! I'm just tired of it...I need a break. I should go to like ....I dunno...Florida for like a month and take a break from everybody! I need it! Well...I don't know what else to say...today I woke up late, ate everything, and did nothing...Until my parents decided that I should have to do stuff. My mom was out gambling away God knows what at the casino with my grandparents all day. I've been scheduling a hotel for when we go to Canada...sounds like a trip from hell. My mom informed me today that the entire trip's purpose is to find drugs that they do not sell here and then to buy them in mass amounts. I'm all for drugs (LEGAL ONES PEOPLES!) but serious...trips should have at least one fun aspect...nope...none in this trip! It's gonna blow already...I know it! So yeah...I get to go cell phone shopping in COUNTDOWN: 3 months! I get a new phone on Sept. 25...I'm so excited to dump by ghetto phone! I don't know what else to say peoples...I've managed to write a lot about a day that consisted of nothing. Well, I'm off to go blow up lots of explosive material! I love fireworks! Did I ever tell you that I am a pyro!? I love it! Here's a little somethin' I found in someone's profile. Till Later y'all!  It was twilight On the Fourth of July Sparkling colors were Strewn across the sky And we sat close enough That we just barely touched While roman candles Went soaring above us and baby Then you put your hand in mine And we ran from the rain Tentatively kissed goodnight And went our separate ways And I've never truly felt the way that I Felt the Fourth of July  Yay for 4th of July! I love America! Good Night all!

      hey y'all ... today was long to say the least. I got up super early and cleaned my room...then I drove like two hours to go pick up my grandparents from the airport IN PORTLAND...yep. But its cool, cause my grandparents are super dope...ya gotta love em. They're here for the next week...we are going up to Canada with em in a few days (not too excited to go to Canada...I don't think I really fit in..if ya know what I mean {I'm an American, if ya don't know what I mean}). So yeah, after we picked em up at the airport we went into Portland and went to Lloyd Center so that my mom could buy a honey baked ham...which is according to my mom and grandma..."the best ham your $50 bill can buy" yes folks, a fifty dollar ham..and you don't even get the whole thing...but thats cool cause I've never bought a fifty dollar ham, and now I have. My life is that much better. Oh yeah, and I had forgotten how cool Lloyd Center is, I haven't been there for like a whole year and their Gap store is even bigger than Southcenter's store...which makes everything great in my book. So yep, bought a ham...and you know...anything else that made me happy...and took off for Oly-town. Oh yeah...I almost forgot...my grandma has one of those handicapped things for your car...so for the next week I get to park in the handicapped spot! Oh Yeah! that totally made my day at the mall today! Its the best ever, she said she would let me buy it off her. oh yeah! Well, after getting home and eating my lovely ham we went to see the fireworks that they do every year in Lacey at Sears. They are usually very good fireworks even compared to California fireworks...but this year they blowed...serious...not too good...I was not impressed...so that sucked. Oh well, what a day...I'm off to go watch Saturday Night Live and go to sleep. Good night all.

      Hey all....well today pretty much sucked. I got up at the early time of 1030 and did nothing but work...my dad wanted me to do this and that and all this crap on a stick. It was no fun at all.  But I did take my car in today to get its brakes fixed so that my car will stop again. Yay...all for the super low price of $162.55. No seriously that is cheap. So ummmm...yeah ... thats all I've got for you today....that is it! I'm gonna clean my room tonight because I am that bored. For the last hour I have watched  Cops and ate three Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream cones. (2 Cookies & Cream, and one Brownie Batter). By the way Brownie Batter is the best ice cream ever! Tomorrow I get ta go to the airport and Portland so y'all can call my cell...Well that's it...I'll leave you with a good quote (well...more a verse). Till Later.  God will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear  Corinthians 10:13

      Today was good. Very good. Gosh. I woke up so early! 9.00 AM!!! I know, crazy. But I had to go take my sister and my cousin to the mall to spend my college savings. Then I had to go get my hair did. I'm still not sure if I like it yet, but I guess its cool. Then I had to go to take my senior pics! Wow....so taking these pics was cool. I hope they turn out well, I just do. I better not be ugly. But I did them at one of the best places around, so if they're ugly, its probably my fault. We'll see, I get them back in two weeks! I'll let you know. Then I came home. I am so tired! Then I watched the Olympics. It was so awesome. The women won the gold in the relay. And an American won the mens gymnastics. It was amazing because he fell down in the vault and was in 12th place. And they said he could not win, but he won gold. It was amazing. Almost inspiring, but I'm not about to go vault of anything ... yet. So yeah.  It was so crazy. After I took my pictures today. It all started clicking. And I started to think about crap. Ok, so senior year is almost here......it is bitter sweet.  Last year was so awesome but i am glad that it is time to move into another part of life.  I can't wait to make new friends and go new places.  Thanks to all my friends for making last year and this summer what it has been. This is a poem I jacked from somewhere, its pretty sad. I really think that I am going to be a wreck next year, I hope I make it through.     Never Forget  Our journey has ended,

      I'm bored. Today I woke up super early, went tanning, dropped off a cd at quiznos for alex, then came home. I cleaned my room and had to clean my house because my cousin flies in tonight and my mom has ocd. Now my room is clean, and everything is good. I am enjoying Judge Judy right now, as I wait for my mom to come pick me up and take us to the airport to get Jeana. I wonder where I'm gonna go for dinner tonight? This is how bored I am...I have to register for the SAT too....gotta do that. Mmm...college is fun.  I'm bored, tired, and not in the mood...Good night team.  *EDIT*  Just got home from the airport. It was good. We stopped in Tacoma and went to eat at the Old Spaghetti Factory. It was yummy. I love that place. We got lost as we were trying to find it so we had to call 411 like three times. But we got there. Downtown Tacoma is kinda cool looking. I didn't hate it. So tomorrow is a big day. I have to wake up early, go tan, get my hair did, then take senior pics. Wish me prettiness! G'nite.

      Do you ever really realize how good you actually have it? I don't. Ever. I think that I see my life in a different light than everybody elses'. I don't know. But today I did see how lucky I am. I guess this has been a culmination of my summer. Because while some people worry about how to pay the bills, and when the next paycheck comes, I am worrying about which shirt to buy at abercrombie. I bought the blue one by the way. Maybe I'll go and get the other one too!   You people are going to yell at me for saying what I'm about to say. But its how I feel, and it might have something to do with what I just said above. A friend was telling me about a friend, who's kinda poor and stuck in a rut. But I was comparing my response to her response to his situation. Gosh I hope this makes sense. Her response was that he deserved (for lack of a better word) handouts. While my response was that he should get a better job. You see here's my theory. Everybody in this world is in the position (in this case socio-economic position) that they are in because of the choices they have made. In this person's case, he didn't go directly to college from high school. I know you are probably thinking 'big deal', but I say that is why they are in this situation. They screwed up along the way, and while it is great that they are trying to fix the problem now, the damage is done. This is just how I feel. See this is the way I run my life. I think every step through as to how it will affect me down the road. I don't feel sorry for people who don't go to college, or who don't work hard (although my definition of hard work is different than some peoples). So don't hate me for my point of view. I just think that this is the way the world works. Your past always comes back to haunt you, and you pay for every mistake. But if I felt sorry for everybody in a bad position, I'd be a real sorry person.   New Subject: My plan is in full swing. Which is good. Because it is.  Today in John's Life: I woke up soooo early at 10.00 and left to go tanning at noon. I got there like ten mins late, and was scared, but they didn't charge me for being late. So all was good. Then I dropped something off for my mom at her old work, then I went and picked up Alex at her house. We went over to St. Peter's to visit her grandma in the hospital. I hate hospitals, but her grandma wasn't actually like sick or hospital-ish, she looked good, so that is good. And the hospital didn't smell like urine. So props to the hospital. Then we went and got Subway, and drove for like 20 minutes into the countryside and ate our Subway on the slide at South Bay Elementary. We had to jump the little fence to get in and Alex was wearing a skirt, so that was mildly entertaining. I still do not know why we drove all the way over to South Bay to eat. I've never even heard of South Bay before today. It was fun none the less. Then I dropped Alex off back at home and came home for like an hour. Then I went to the KAP graduation picnic shindig. Today Alex and Emmy graduated from KAP. Which is a big thing for them, cause they've been doing it for all of their life. When I graduated last year, it wasn't a big deal for me cause it was never a big part of my life, but it was a big part of their life. So I saw them graduate. My mom called in the middle of it and says I need to know six colleges that you want to go to right now for the college advisor who we pay way too much money to to get me into college. He wanted to know today. Apparantly you are supposed to know this already. But then again, according to him, I need a 1400 on the SAT too. Whatever. I have to register for the Oct. and Nov. SAT tests tomorrow....I hope I don't forget. tomorrow being today because it is one am already. I should sleep...thats all I've got for y'all...  Good Night/Morning (if ya wanna get technical)

      Today was a great day. Lots of fun, even though I spent it with my mom and sister. I woke up so early this morning at like 11.30. It was awful, but I had a tanning appointment at noon, so I had to book it. After that I met my mom and sis for lunch at Appleby's. It was good, I love Applebys. Then we headed to the Tacoma Mall. Much better mall than here, which is why I drive a half hour to go shop there. My sister managed to spend three hundred dollars at abercrombie...again. I got one Abercrombie polo and a shirt at the Gap. But yeah, we conquered that mall. So school shopping is officially underway, just as scheduled. I had a lot of fun today. Oh yeah, and we went to Costco...alwyas fun. So yeah, tomorrow, I'm not up to much. I was thinking of actually starting on my AP Gov assingment. Seeing that it is due in ten days. hmmm....or maybe I'll put it off till later. Anyways. That's all I've got for today.   "The world is beautiful, but it has a disease called man" - Nietzsche  I used to think we drank margaritas together because we were having fun, but now I think we were having fun because we were drinking margaritas.  G'nite.

      And it's all Alex's fault. Before today I never even really thought about leaving everybody, but now, I'm all depressed. As Alex said, "I don't wanna grow up"...it sucks. I don't wanna leave my life as it is, I don't wanna leave my friends, my lifestyle. I'm afraid of having to start all over, and mostly being poor. Cause I will be...I'm afraid. But shhhhh! don't tell anybody! I've always been the type to face my future right in the eyes and take it on. That's what I'll do..but nobody said I can't have hesitiations.  Today was a good day. I woke up at noon. Cleaned my room. Went tanning. Then went to the play at Capital. Man of La Mancha. It was good. Kinda confusing, but good. Then Emmy, Alex, Adi and I all went over to Max's house to hang out for a few hours. It was good times. These are gonna be the things I don't wanna give up. But I know I have to, and there will be way better times after them. Tomorrow, I'm not doing much. Sleepin in prolly havin lunch with my mom or something.  In other news, the plan is still in effect. Going strong, and still on schedule. Can't wait for it.  I'm super tired. I'm going to bed now. I'll leave you with a really sad little story that Alex just sent me. it makes me depressed inside. G'nite everybody.  I read of a reverend who stood to speak at the funeral of his friend. He referred to the date on her tombstone from the beginning... to the end. He noted that first came the date of her birth and spoke of the date with tears but he said what mattered most of all was the dash between those years. For that dash represents all the time that she spent alive on earth, and now only those who loved her know what that little line is worth. For it matters not how much we own; the cars, the house, the cash. What matters is how we lived and loved and how we spend our dash. So think about this long and hard, Are there things you'd like to change? For you never know how much time is left You could be at "dash mid-range" If we could just slow down enough to consider what's true and real, and always try to understand the way other people feel, and be less quick to anger, show appreciation more and love the people in our life like we've never loved before. If we treat each other with respect, more often wear a smile remembering that this special dash might only last a little while. So when your eulogy is being read with your life's actions to rehash...would you be pleased with the things they say about how you spent your dash?  G'nite.

      I just got home from my five day family bonding camping excursion into the great depths of Grayland Beach. I did have fun at a Washington state beach. I never thought I'd say that. But hey, we just relaxed, spent time on the beach, rode ghetto go-karts ( I only broke 3 vertabrae) and yeah....all sorts of good stuff. Best story of the trip. One day we went to go look at these very cool new condos built right on the beach in Westport. My mom falls in love with this one on the 3rd floor (highest floor) and decides we need to invest in it. So she just about went and dropped half a million dollars on this condo...too bad my dad talked her out of it. Oh well, i'm sure we'll find another way to spend 500 g's. In other news...I'm still not tan, and senior pictures are on Wednesday. Not too excited about that one. And I'm officially excited/depressed because school starts in less than one month, and I have not yet begun to shop for school clothes. And I just discovered that today, well yesterday was Friday the 13th....crazy weird.  Tomorrow (today), I'm going to see Man of La Mancha at the theater. Alex and Emmy are teching it so I have to see it all by myself....I'm sad. And on tuesday my cousin from San Francisco is flying in to spend some time here. She's cool, but she's my sisters age. So they hang out a lot...apparantly I'm obligated to go to the airport...hmmm....not cool, but its all good. So that's all I got. Y'all better call me so I can have some stuff to do. That's all I got homies!

      well...I'm off...we're leaving in an hour or so. I kinda want to go this time, I'll get a lot done. I can't ever get anything done around here. Too many distractions. So I hope to get a lot done over there. Plus it will be relaxing, hopefully...I'll see you all on Friday night.  I'll have my cell phone, it might even be on.  Later.

      I love how some people love to play using guerilla tactics. Attack and retreat. Attack and retreat. You should know what i'm talking about.  I guess, I was thinking about some old crap that came up a long time ago. I realize that I have friends that claim to be my friends, but if I knew the truth about them they would never be my friend. I would not let them. It's confusing. I wish people would be honest with me. If you have something to say...tell me, e-mail me or something. Some people disguise themselves as my friends, but in all honesty they're cowards. Plain and simple.  The plan is still in action, looking good.  Dum de dum....I'm bored. Today was good. Just a day...I guess. I realized something... I dot dot dot a lot. Like this... ! I do that a lot. I should stop. Today I went to Les Miserables with Emmy. I hope I spelled that right. It was a really good show. Like REALLY good. So that's good. Then we (we being Alex, Emmy, and I) drove to Lacey. Why would we drive to Lacey you might ask? I continue to ask myself. There was no point. But we went to one of those Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combinations. We got pizza and enchaladas (sp?), and some like fried apple things. It was yummie. Then I dropped Emmy and Alex off and sped home to be home by my ghetto curfew of midnight. Damn Allison, she's the reason I have to be home at midnight. errgh...Tomorrow I have to wake up early and do crap with my mom to get ready for our little family vacay on Monday. I'm, continuing, for some strange reason, to look forward to it. Then I'm going to a party at Morgan's with the gang. It'll be fun. So yah..it's late...I'm drowsy.  I gotta stop thinking about everything, go back to the good old days when I was ignorant, blonde, and living a life in absolute bliss. Good night.

      Do you ever wonder who in this world you can actually trust? I never thought about it before, but I think there are probably three people in this world I can really trust. Is that bad? I don't know...I was thinking again. You know what happens when I think....  Anyways, every year my family goes away for five days on a "camping" trip. I usually don't look forward to them because they are family outings...together. But for some reason I'm thinking that it will be good to get away from everything for five days. No computer, no telephone, no people....it'll be nice. I might even leave my cell phone behind. I don't know. You may not know that my family camping is in a 31' travel trailer. heh. We don't believe in camping, we need a fridge, microwave, television, and all those goodies. But last year I got so much done during that trip. I got my entire AP history book read and my entire AP english book read. I got a lot done. This year I'm looking forward to it because I want to catch up on stuff and get away from people for a few days too. I want to get my entire ap government book re-read (cause I forgot what it was about....yikes.) And I want to get through my entire SAT study book which I'm only like 20% done with....It'll be exciting. But seriously, I'll get a lot done and hopefully it'll be sunny too cause I need to get tan. Last year I got really tan. Yeah, so I'm looking forward to it....for the first time. I leave on Monday. But since I got up at noon today, I should probably start doing something productive.  Till Later.

      Every once in a while my mom gets in these little like "Lets be a Family!" mood. It's always fun. Today we all had to go to the County Fair! Yes folks that means pigs, cows, and other offending animals in one small area. Not to mention the wonderful aroma coming from it. I was a happy camper. Luckily, we only stayed there for a few hours, did some other stuff, and now I'm home, rather drowsy.  Every once in a while I get in semi-depressed moods. Tonight is one of them. I usually just listen to depressing music, decide that my life is good and move on. I DON'T HAVE MY MUSIC!!! Emmy has my CD player cause I left it in her carry on when we came home from San Francisco on Tuesday. I won't get it back until Saturday when I see her at the show. Not too happy about that but oh well! I'm depressed....get over it. Tomorrow I'm going to catch up on everything...I have to get studying for the SAT too! My college company people keep saying that its my only hope of getting money for college. I need to get a 1400. I need 130 more points! Yikes....I hope I can do it...I'm gonna study like a mo fo. I havent talked to Alex in a while...don't really know why...maybe I'll call her soon...or maybe not...she can call me.  You think you know me Word on the street is that you do You want my history What others tell you won't be true I walked a thousand miles while everyone was asleep Nobody's really seen my million subtleties Got stains on my t-shirt and I'm the biggest flirt Right now I'm solo, but that will be changing eventually, oh Got bruises on my heart and sometimes I get dark If you want my auto, want my autobiography Baby, just ask me  I hear you talking Well, it's my turn now I'm talking back Look in my eyes So you can see just where I'm at I walked a thousand miles to find one river of peace I walked a million more to find what fish is which Got stains on my t-shirt and I'm the biggest flirt Right now I'm solo, but that will be changing eventually, oh Got bruises on my heart and sometimes I get dark If you want my auto, want my autobiography Baby, just ask me  I'm the baddest girl in this messed up world I'm the crazy girl in this crazy world I'm a simple girl in a complex world A nasty girl, you wanna get with me? You wanna mess with me? Got stains on my t-shirt and I'm the biggest flirt Right now I'm solo, but that will be changing eventually, oh I laugh more than I cry You piss me off, good-bye Got stains on my t-shirt and I'm the biggest flirt If you want my auto, want my autobiographyBaby, just ask me  I love Ashlee Simpson, shes my newest hero...that song was kinda cool today...so now you've got it...kinda describes my mood at the moment...minus the "I'm a nasty girl" part....thats just....not me...Well team....I best be off...need to get some sleep. Oh and yeah...I leave on Monday for a five day family "camping" excursion...it should be an....expierience ... to say the least....looking forward to that one....Good Night everybody!

      Prepare yourself...this will be long! I had a great time in San Francisco this last week (hence the not blogging). I guess I'll just try to run through the trip for ya ... cause I know you're all just that interested. Emmy and I partied down to the airport in Portland (yes kids..in Oregon) and we got there like two hours early so we got to party in the airport. It was good times...we finally got on our plane and Emmy falls asleep...so I was bored for the first hour of my trip....ergh. Oh well....she woke up (eventually...) and the flight was super short, we met Morgan at the airport and she was with Gary. Gary is the super cool guy who let two complete strangers (and teenagers!) stay in his house for a week. He was really nice and really funny so that was cool. Umm....I really don't want to go through everyday (partially because it is all just one big blur). Um....Gary lived in the Twin Peaks...super high and really cold...but very nice. I hadn't been to San Francisco in so long and we did so many things that I hadn't done on my last trip to San Fran with my mom. Like go down to Haight Street, and party down the Castro, and Chinatown, and go to all these fun places.  The day after we got there, Gary had to leave on a business trip for like four days, so we got to rock his house all by ourselves. The thing about Gary is that he is totally fine with us doing whatever, and I mean WHATEVER we wanted to do...he even loaded the fridge with Jello shots before he left. (I liked the blue ones). heh. But yeah...he has lots of Bacardi and all that good stuff, we had mad parties in the hot tub (include beverages mentioned above). It was good times.  When Gary got back on Sunday, we basically still did our own thing, which meant shopping a lot and crusin around the city. We did Pier 39 like twice, the wharf, ghiradelli square, chestnut street, we did chinatown twice, Little Italy, the Castro, Haight street. We went to the aquarium and went through those neat little glass tunnels with all the animals all around (I haven't been in one of those in years!), we saw two movies at the Metrion too! We saw the Bourne Supremeacy, which was good, Morgan didn't like it, but I thought it was pretty good. Especially since I never saw the first one, it still made sense. It was all action-ish and whatnot....I liked it. Then a few days later we saw The Villiage! That was the best movie in so long! I really liked it, the ending was so unexpected, it was crazy good. I thought it was awesome. Y'all should see it!  I guess that's all we did, I mean we did a ton more than that, but that's all I can think of right now...but there are lots of good stories y'all can hear later if you ask me! Like when Emily got hit on in the subway by a guy who was cracked out on herion, it was pretty funny. So yah...we conquered the San Francisco. We came home this afternoon, our flight was delayed about 40 minutes or so....(not cool but whatever) and I felt so sick right when we got on the plane. I don't really know why because I'm not afraid of planes or anything, cause I fly all the time, but I think it may have had something to do with the caramel macchiato I got at the starbucks in the terminal. There were these two people of asian descent operating the joint and I'm not sure they really spoke English, and I am positive that they did not know how to properly prepare a beverage. But I drank it anyways, and I think it made me really sick. But after I ate on the plane I felt a lot better! oh yeah, the plane on the way home was one of those tiny little ones that you walk up the stairs to get on to...we got a ramp, but you get it....I've never been on one that small before, crazy...now I have! score.  I'm glad to be home, I always am after a vacation. I mean I never want to come home. Ever. But once I'm home, I'm really happy to be here. Life is so happy here, no worries, just happiness, plus I missed everything...now I'm home. For now.  Plans for this week: --Finish AP book and do that dumb essay --Do nothing else, and sleep in every day --Les Miserables with Emmy on Saturday --Party at Morgans on Sunday  That's my life....like it, or love it. Till later. Good night.
