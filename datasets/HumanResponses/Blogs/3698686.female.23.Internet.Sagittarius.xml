      Thurs, June 24 2004 Hehehehehe… I finally have my favourite cuisine today. The inevitable, irressistable  nasi lemak …  yum yum . I was eating with one hand and talking to customer on the other hand. Man, it was worth it; at least I have had my nasi lemak. I had this craving for days already. Yesterday, I was continuosly  “terrorizing”  my friend Susan with my cravings. It was nearly lunch time and unfortunately nasi lemak is hard to find during this hour in Penang. She said I have the cravings of a pregnant women..hmm..maybe not. But I believe I was pregnant after I stuffed my mouth with  Kayu Nasi Kandar . I was bloated then. But it was good food and it was sort of substitute for my cravings too. Now as I m on the topics of cravings, I guess I know what my next one…the  wan tan mee  in Melaka, in my taman.   I watched  the  Chronicles of Riddick  on Tuesday. Apparently every Tues is movie day, so there is a  whopping 50% discount …yippee. Also, tht means, the cinema will be crowded. Since there are not much “good” seats left, me and my champ took the couple seat. As we r seated in the cinema, there was an unbelievable sights and smell. Scream, yell …**BOs  are everywhere. Few minutes after the show begun, when everyone(the considerate, punctual citizens) are ALL properly seated, a few  loud mouth “jokers” stomp their way through the cinema with their  god-knows-what  voices. Maybe they misunderstood our excitement about the movie for their bloody conversation. Not forgetting , the smell of Petaling Street version of  Polo Sports  on human sweat. You think you can get away from the haze in the cinema…maybe you should think again, man. The chemical in the congested room has a new defined version of the “unhealthy” level.  Now about the movie...as always, the trailer was like…wow, good stuff here man. But the movie, overall ratings hmm…3  “the tarik”  only ( 5 “the tarik” reserved for movie’s like Lord of the Rings, Roberto Begnini’s Life is Beautiful ). It was rather to fulfill my  LOTR emptiness syn drome. There were noticeable similarities the army armour in these two movies. And I kinda like the tower with 3 evil face. I thought it looks weirdly magnificent. The bad guys, the  Necromongers  (nah, not the workers you see in the wet market), were so inevitable but superhero Riddick (Van Diesel) can beat a few of the so-called-unbeatable army of Necromongers. I hate it when they always exaggerate the superhero in the fighting scene. And he look arrogant and pompous…ptui!…I wonder how many gals will go ga-ga over his character . Ridikulous Riddick, I may say. What can I say he has triple  XXX  energy …maybe  size  too. Umm I am not specifying which location though *wink*. The only show stealer act is veteran actor, Judi Dench. Honestly, her portrayal as not-so-mental Elemental was pretty cool. Mind my language but all those names rhymes with something funny. The babe in Mission Impossible 2, Thandie Newton was rather disappointing. She failed to be evil, seductress, Dame of Necromonger ….she looks like a sweet, innocent gal trying so hard to be a bad bitch. Quit the trying, gal. Her facial expression was fake and she look like a  dizzy, bubble gum , cheerleader gal  , or in another words bBIMBO . Sorry gal, but u made the movie look bad!!!  Now I m heading to my “Quality Philosophy” training then later enjoy some good music courtesy of Rayner.

      Tues, June 22 2004, 11:20am  Bleah ...."It was obvious that the haze is back again this year looking at the conditions the past few days and today. Yesterday, EHS had reported  that the API readings in Penang was “Unhealthy” while visibility was as low as 3-5 km at Bayan Lepas and Butterworth."    Thats y there Penang bridge and the sea is almost invisible..bleah. Anyway, wakin up in the morning these few days, make me feel wee bit sick in my tummy. I felt nauseas and dizzy. Really thought escaping from the big  notorious   metropolitan city  will really help me get fresher air. Rite now trying my very best not to inhale too much *choke*. Plus, constant visit to toilet everyday have create an ugly zombie out of me. Think about it, I mite consider moving a matress to the toilet to be  bed + toilet . The germs really gettin to my system.   The weather looks rather gloomy..theres a colleague tht told me this year was doomsday...as predicted by tht guy whose name i can barely spell.Let's see...uhmm... n,o,s,t,r,a,d,o,m,a,s .  Hoorah ....i just did it. The infamous 9/11 predictor, so they say. May i say i actually think there's no such thing as 100% accuracy in predictions? I am sceptical about the future. If we live our life, so well-written and planned, then what bout the "man upstairs"? I am one stubborn person who cannot accept anything as fact until I experience and see 'em, wif my  own eyes . And somebody ask me about  God . If we cant see  HIM  do u still trust in H IM ? I m not tht spiritual in any sort but I know its tht intuition tells me many of my "bad experience" was saved when i prayed really hard. Conclusion is: I believe there is a  creator .  Just imagine if the world really going to  end this year ... what would u do? Most ppl will be in their most polite and compromise manner. We shall take no one or anything for granted no more. The joy of waking up early in the morning and have ur morning kiss and hug. But rather in our normal, daily life..may i say with the rush, the madness of the bustling city and endless deadlines, we tend to get agitated over tiny reasons. Just tell someone u have 1 month to live and they treat u really nice....u got the picture? quite pathetic...  well well well...my plan about the end of the world. On the nite before doomsday, I will lie on the grass snuggle tight with  "loverboy"  and watch the stars together. Then we would go to the beach and tell each other how we appreciate our lifes and each other till the end . Tht way, I dun regret anything when i die. Uhm get a grip! I m watching too many movies. but yikes...not 2004..i certainly believe it WILL be this year. Prob it's too soon. Hmm, like the war in Iraq not yet over, like we never have aliens as our neighbours, like Osama is still there and like we never discover another planet where we could move if  earth crashes !   Heres what I wish for: good health, love, happiness, and maybe $$$$(dun we all wish tht)

      Oh gosh! I couldn't believe... I am a  blogger virgin.  so forgive me ppl out there...if you think this is a bunch of trash. I would really love to call it my secret hideout. I can express all my thoughts and feelings rite here *sigh*  Its odd having  Fridays free . Anyway I spent my Fridays doing chores and watching series. Not tht complaining ...I really hate chores ..yes i do! They do ur skin bad. Anyway, I look at this as my exercise routine . And I despise dirt. Maybe growing up with my mom make me feel  paranoid  about cleanliness. I may not be tidy but I hate any stain or dirt. I once dreamt that I fainted in the toilet..and all i thought ewwwww...the germs is gonna get me. And the tought of it makes me wanna puke.  I couldn't believe I m a lil' hooked on the Sex and the City series. I used to think its about 4 sad ass chick complaining about realtionship  all THE TIME . Until I realised there is an inner truth to it. Boyfriends alike, girlfriends are everlasting. Boys they come , break your heart and the gals are just there to take you out and go shopping. Almost ALL girls will agree shopping is therapy. It made me missed my girlfriends...so so much.  I felt a little selfish at times. Having a relationship also meant putting  "galfriendship"  in your least priority list. And yet, when we have bad relationship...its either Oreo or chatting on the phone. I m glad I have blessed souls to trust on telling my problems. Like she said, my life is so complicated. Guess it's true. Well, those ghastly experience have really made me an understanding and more patient lil' creature.  Talking about patience....Patience take its toll. When do u realise  Enough is Enough ? what is the considerable patience limit? I have met with Mr. Hyde. I am beginning to feel terrified with his presence. The little child in me whimper whenever he appear. It wouldnt be the same again with fear beating in my heart.  I m still looking for a  "silly"  sign tht i can put my best foot foward and decide on smthg. I can make any now...because it's a really hard situation. At the same time, i wish i had the memory eraser equipment tht is featured in MIB(men in black). The memory is killing me. What is it with the word  "give n take".  I m not sure...but there is smell of suicide. I seriously m not tht n will not take the road either.  I realise kindness will not prove anything..it will not  make the wicked repent . Something I can't live without. I cannot imagine tht kinda life. Is it loneliness or perhaphs just memories? Then again what about living with bad memories. Those images flash before ur eyes from time to time. Like a being in a  time travel machine   and visiting years of bad memories. I wish  kindness  can make someone realise. The beauty of first touch, scent and sight faded when Mr Hyde comes into the picture.   Dr. Jekyll was the sweetest person. Mr. Hyde never appeared then.I just enjoy making evrybody happy. But when ur too  happy , they think u never take ur  life seriously .I used to live everyday like it was my last day. Since tht incident, I need to make my life  worthwhile. Mom said i might have an  angel  guarding me then.  Well  Mr.angel  here did not do a good job with Mr. Hyde. I just need someone to blame apart for myself. My confusion is...everybody have Mr. Hyde hiding beneath their skins. Yeah u got it! The criminal case we read in the newspaper, the culprit,  Mr. Hyde . But I tame the angry monster with my heart. I nearly want to explode many times ... but i bottled it up and erase them. Once a while they appeared in my dreams though. The question why would Mr Hyde appear even when they have loved ones staring into their eyes? What if there is an image of a sweet little gal smilling ...will it be strong enough to make Hyde disappear. Will  love  triumph over  anger ?  Punishment  for  realizations ? I prefer kindness and good heart. Sick of the bad reruns...now back to my life and think no nonsense:)  uh oh yeah...pictures coming up SOON!!!!
