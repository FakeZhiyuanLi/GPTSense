      On Saturday July 24th our daughter came into the world. She weighed 8lbs.7oz and was 21.5 inches long.   Mandy delivered through Cesaraen by Dr. Cobbs.  They were afraid she may have pre eclamsia? which causes seizures.  Dr. Cobbs came to the rescue and everything turned out real well.  She came to the world at 3:11pm in Arlington Hospital.  The moments leading up to the delivery were filled with prayer and excitement.  Olivia means peace and we wanted to believe that the peace of God would fill the whole event.  It did!  David Neil stayed with the Skuces during the birth and did real well.

      Mandy is ready to have the baby and we are all in eager anticipation.&nbsp; It helps me understand the scripture in Romans 8 where it talks about God is in eager anticipation for the revealing of his own sons and daughters to come forth.&nbsp; Mandy and I have worked real hard preparing the way for our daughter Olivia.&nbsp; Mandy is in pain and discomfort and cannot sleep well.&nbsp; I guess what I am learning is the challenge and pains of bringing natural and spiritual children to this world...

      "Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older.&nbsp; All of you, clothe yourself with humility towards one another, because "God opposese the proud but gives grace to the humble."&nbsp; Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that He may lift you up in due time.&nbsp; Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you."&nbsp; (1 Peter 4:5-7)  This sums up my thoughts for the day.&nbsp; I know many times I am concerned on what to wear to look good and feel good about myself.&nbsp; Jeans or sweats, t-shirt or long sleeve, sandals or shoes, etc.&nbsp; But the most important part of my dress needs to be am I getting clothed with humility?&nbsp; Humility means lowly and unpretentious.&nbsp; Essentially we all must realize who is in charge which is God.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have bad breath, my pits stink, and a lot of other flaws that I need to stay conscious when I start getting a little proud.

        "Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed if possible the hour might pass from him." (Mark 14:35)    This really stood out to me today as I read the word.  I was thinking how our Lord Jesus was fully man and had to suffer so much though He was filled with the Spirit.  He felt pain and felt challenges just like me.  I feel overwhelmed by all the worlds problems and many times I don't know what on earth I can do.  I wish things were different everyday I am alive.  When I read this I see that Jesus felt overwhelmed as well.  He set the example by falling down and praying and even asking that the trial could pass.  In Luke it talks about an angel from heaven that came and strengthened him during this time.  The principal is clear:  as we fall down and pray during our trials God will bring us strength from heaven supernaturally so we can face it properly and with faith.  God help me in my trials to not run but to fall down.

      In Luke 3:23  it talks about Jesus as the descendant of Joseph "or so it was thought (or supposed)".  This stands out to me as I grow in the Lord.  I am a son to Paul Derocher who helped raise me and is my natural father BUT I also have a father in Heaven that guides me far more than my natural father ever could.  My dad on this earth has been a great blessing and source of encouragement but he was unable to do it all.  Thankfully I have a father in heaven thanks to Jesus Christ.  In 2 Corinthians 6 it talks about how God will be a father to us.  In the Lord's prayer He tells us to call out to our Father.  In John 20:17 Jesus tells us that He ascends to His Father and our Father.  The point is that through Christ we have so much more than just our earthly parents.  My parents are great people but they could never figure me totally out.  It takes God Almighty to handle all my thoughts and desires.  Perhaps it could be said of my  lineage that I was born from Paul Derocher "or so it was thought".  God wanted to father me since before time began.
