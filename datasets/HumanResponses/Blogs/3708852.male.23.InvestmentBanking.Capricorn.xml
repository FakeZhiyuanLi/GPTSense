						   Tina's turning 21, and a contingent from all corners of our great nation will be coverging on Las Vegas Jul. 30-Aug. 2 to celebrate in a flurry of libations and decadence that can only be found in places where there are rampant discussions of "dry heat."  Now, many of you have been to Vegas before, so I am asking you for advice on what to do, what to bring, etc.  A few things to keep in mind:  *I'm there, more or less, for 3 days. *Our hotel for all but our first night is set.  Suggestions are welcome for cheap places on/by the strip. *I'm a big blackjack player, but the cheaper the table, the better.  You won't see me at the $25 tables anytime soon.  And I'm sure that even if I was to have some luck plucking down big chips, Mariano Riviera would be brought out of the Asian gaming room (Sports Guy fans will get that joke). *I have set a max loss limit at $100/day. *I have NO desire to see Wayne Newton, the Siegfried & Roy remix, or any other ultra-cheesy shows.  If I wanted to see those, I'd just drive up to Branson.  Drop suggestions in the comments section.  Much 'ppreciated.

						   Big ups to Kate Pitsch for setting up one of these so I could swindle myself into thinking I need one as well.   urlLink Click here to visit hers.   Are blogs an effective way to communicate with friends and even strangers hundreds or even thousands of miles away or are they just desperate attempts to make our boring lives seem blindly more exciting?  I'm not sure, but it is for BOTH of those reasons I have started this blog. :-)  I apologize to my friends who normally receive a call from me every couple months or so.  Things have been relatively hectic with work and most of my free time is spent working out or playing PSI half-asleep.  I promise I'll get better about this over the next few weeks.   My St. Louis basketball partner Michelle Miller sent me the program from Dean Sara Johnson's memorial service.  Dean Johnson was my four year advisor while @ Wash U and was the most constant level of support over four years of college.  I would avoid her calls, skip meetings, and overall show how undeserved I was of her assistance and patientce.  And despite all of that, she would always call/visit with a smile and questions of what was going on with me.  For those of you who know me as the next Einstein, my laziness in academia at times got the best of me while I was at Wash U, culminating in me deferring my graduation a week before we walked.  Yet Dean Johnson was always encouraging and kept pushing me in the most gentle way possible.  Dean Johnson wasn't family.  Dean Johnson wasn't a prof.  In fact, the last time I saw her was in the beginning of the spring '03 semester, more than a year before she died.  But it's always hard to lose someone who cared more about you at times than you cared about yourself.  I know I never disappointed Dean Johnson, but it's tough to lose someone before u have a chance to apologize for not doing the things you should have done and before u have a chance to thank them for saying the things you didn't deserve to hear.  Another sad reminder that to Carpe Diem.   I'm going to go call some friends.

						   In Las Vegas I'll be spending one night at the "Westward Ho."  Don't ask.  While watching the Cardinals beat up on the Mariners last weekend, I decided that Albert Pujols' walk-up music isn't impressive enough.  For those non-baseball fans (as in, ALL OF YOU), most teams allow players to pick the music that plays while they walk up to bat or warm up to pitch.  Pujols' music is some generic pop/hip hop beat.  No style.  No flavor.  Nutin'.  He needs something much better.  This got me to thinking: what would my walk-up music be?  I probably spent 10-15 mins thinking about this and going through my MP3s to figure out THE song.  However, I couldn't decide on just one.  I have situational ones.  My thoughts are below:  1st batter up: "Here I Go" by Mystikal  Middle of the order or middle of game: "Get By" by Talib Kweli Knight Rider Banghra (not the Jay-Z version)  9th inning: "Bombs Over Baghdad" by Outkast  I would love for the 2 of you that read this thing to share your potential walk-up songs.
