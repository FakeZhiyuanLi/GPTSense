      It's been so long since i had updated my blog,These past few days nothing extraordinary has come up yet..i'm still hanging around and waiting to go to uni..I just couldn't help wonder yesterday how much we are dependend on technology nowdays..I thought about it as i couldn't remember my close friends handphone number and had to search it in my handphone..How much time has changed..as before i had everything saved in my mind..only when my credit has finish yesterday that i had to phoneher using my house phone that i realised how much dependent we r on machines..And this is only the handphone..not to mention the t.v( the idiot-box ),washing machine,air-cond,and of course the ever popular computer..i mean who could be dumb enough to spill out all the daily happenings in a blog!What happened to the old key-locked and notebook diary which we use to keep so carefully so that no one could read it? Instead  here we r writting our diaries out in the open so the whole world can read it?Anyway here are a few jokes i would like to share with u all(Yes!I  AM  trying to change the subject)  Stress Reliever # 1 Wife: You always carry my photo in your handbag to the office. Why? Hubby: When there is a problem, no matter how impossible,  I look at your picture and the problem disappears. Wife: You see, how miraculous and powerful I am for you? Hubby: Yes, I see your picture and say to myself, "What other problem can there be greater than this one?" _____________________________________________________  Stress Reliever # 2 Girl: When we get married, I want to share all your worries,  troubles and lighten your burden. Boy: It's very kind of you, darling, But I don't have any worries or  troubles. Girl: Well that's because we aren't married yet. ___________________________________________________ Stress Reliever # 3 Son: Mom, when I was on the bus with Dad this morning, he  told me to give up my seat to a lady. Mom: Well, you have done the right thing. Son: But mum, I was sitting on daddy's lap. _____________________________________________________  Stress Reliever # 4 Wife to husband: "What's your excuse for coming home at this time of the night?" Husband to wife: "Golfing with friends, my dear." Wife to husband: "What? At 2 am?!" Husband to wife: "Yes, We used night clubs." _____________________________________________________

      I'm back again..as usual nothing much happened today..got up early today(yes,i know.I'm amazed myself)Read the newspaper and something rather interesting caught my attention..The fact that the 128 studets who obtained CGPA points of 4.0 who weren't offered places in local universities for medical courses are finally going to be given places.The funny thing is for the past few days everyone is writting their comments everywhere that the non-bumis should not make this a racial issue since they have implemented the meritrocracy system instead of the usual kuota system.However the point is not the meritrocracy system but the problem is matriculation.This system has been a confusing thing as the standards between matriculation and stpm(world regonised.mind you!)are apparently very different.The problem is that in stpm the exam papers are marked in a more sytematic way with examiners troughtout malaysia wherelse the mariculation system is marked by the lectures of the colleges internally..Where is the logic?Anyway besides that i'm happy that it's all resolved now that the deserving students will be given places.Basically nothing else happened...so..cioa again!

SOON! Besides that i did'nt do much today but i hope when i get into uni i will have much to write about..The new enviroment and all!Till then leaving now..Have fun and thanks for visiting this site(I doubt anyone is anyway)Visit this site if anyone's interested in language classes..hehehe..www.parlo.com/
