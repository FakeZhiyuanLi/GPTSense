						   New legislation introduced late Tuesday by a group of powerful U.S. senators would let artists and entertainment companies sue creators of products, such as peer-to-peer software and copying programs, that "induce" copyright violations. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch, clearly targeting P-to-P vendors, claims his bill focuses on companies that profit by encouraging children and teenagers to infringe copyrights.  "It is illegal and immoral to induce or encourage children to commit crimes," Hatch, a Utah Republican, says in a statement. "Tragically, some corporations now seem to think that they can legally profit by inducing children to steal. Some think they can legally lure children into breaking the law with false promises of 'free music.'"  Choosing Sides  The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) welcomes the legislation, while P2P United, a P-to-P trade group, calls the bill "horrible public policy." The measure could stifle the development of future technologies that could be used for copyright infringement but have substantial legitimate uses, say P2P United and other critics.  The bill "will chill the development, if enacted, of not only peer-to-peer technology, but wonderful new information tools yet to be devised," says Adam Eisgrau, P2P United executive director, in an e-mail message. "Don't buy the hype. Any member of Congress who supports this bill is voting, without so much as a hearing, to undo more than a century of solid copyright case law that has protected innovators and technology from the terrible power of entrenched industries and, in the process, created the American economy."

						   AMD issued a patch today that effected its Opteron & Athlon 64 processors. The problem was BIOS related which caused these the processors mentioned above to freeze up.  Advanced Micro Devices has issued a fix for a glitch that could cause computers containing its Opteron and Athlon 64 processors to freeze. The glitch, dubbed "erratum 109," results from incorrect assembly instructions issued inside the processors, but is considered to be rare. It has only been seen inside AMD's validation laboratory, which uses specially-designed diagnostic software to test AMD processors, a company representative said.  AMD notified its partners of the erratum in April and recently issued a software fix for it to makers of BIOS system software, which helps run PCs and servers. Resultant BIOS software updates are likely to become available soon. Errata are fairly common in the complex business of manufacturing processors and are often dealt with through new versions of BIOS software. Those updates are typically distributed by computer manufacturers.

						   A judge in California has dismissed approximately 50 toxic chemical lawsuits filed by former IBM employees against the computer giant, following a round of court-ordered mediation.  The employees had charged that IBM was responsible in part for a series of cancers and other illnesses, which they said were attributable to working with toxic chemicals used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. An IBM spokesman said only that the cases, which represent all the outstanding toxics lawsuits facing the company in California courts, had been "concluded and dismissed." He declined to discuss whether the two sides had jointly agreed on a settlement.  The attorney for the former employees, San Jose, Calif.-based plaintiffs lawyer Richard Alexander, could not immediately be reached for comment. The first two cases from the pool of California plaintiffs reached courts late last year. After a trial that stretched several months, a jury dismissed the claims against IBM. The judge in that case ordered the two sides into a mediation process in an attempt to settle the remaining outstanding lawsuits in the state.

Eventually I had to leave, but felt drowsy, so she offers to drive my car and me back to her apartment.  We find rows of elevators at a far wall (reminiscent of the ones in the Santa Fe building), hop in one, and start making out intensely on what had to have been the longest elevator ride ever.  Five minutes later, the elevator finally "dings," and we pause, linger for a while, glaring at the open door, and slink out into the parking garage.  I toss her my car keys and wait for her to pull the Caravan out.  As she does, the sickest grinding sound lacerates my ears (think of Kev's birthday and Nissan).  She was squeezing through two closely parked cars, and the sides of my once-beautiful Caravan are just crumpled and scratched.  I look at my her with complete dumbfoundment, and she strolls out, gives me a hug, and says, "Don't worry, my insurance will cover it."  Nonsensic

						   Computer trade show Comdex, once the biggest event on the tech calendar, has been canceled this year, a victim of the growing interest in shows emphasizing consumer electronics and specialist IT gear.  Eric Faurot, vice president of Comdex organizer MediaLive International, revealed the plans in an exclusive interview with CNET News.com, saying the company plans to give Comdex a breather after years of falling attendance, in the number of both attendees and vendors. "We feel that while we could run Comdex profitably this year, it really wouldn't serve the interests of the broader IT industry," he said. The international versions of the show are expected to continue as planned. Faurot maintained that Comdex, which has a long-term contract with the Las Vegas Convention Center running through 2007, would be back in 2005. Key to that return, however, is the ability of a newly formed advisory board comprising major vendors to rally support for the annual conference.  Comdex traces its roots to a casino owner who launched the Computer Dealers Exposition in 1979. Four years later a young Bill Gates delivered his first keynote speech and demonstrated Microsoft's new DOS 2.0. Although it grew to become one of the biggest trade shows in the world, at its peak attracting more than 200,000 attendees and filling more than 1 million square feet of floor space, Comdex's fortunes have sagged in the past few years as the tech economy faltered and security jitters kept some companies from traveling.

						   Thanks to Dane2003 who posted leaked screenshots of the yet to be released Norton Antivirus 2005 currently in Beta. First impressions show more updates to the same UI layout we know from Norton Antivirus 2003 and 2004. A new addition would be the 'Feature Deactivation Alert' yet another process in the background running, as if we need them!  Anyway if tracking the newest popular software is your thing feast your eyes on the screenshots of the product that will most likely be available (as with earlier versions) to public test soon.

						   Spammers are adding spyware to their toolsets in an effort to get more recipients to open junk mail rather than automatically reach for the delete key, security and filtering firm MessageLabs said Wednesday.  Spyware is being used by spammers to sap personal information from a PC. The details are then incorporated into spam messages, typically in the subject line, the idea being that recipients will be more likely to open messages when they see something specific to them in the header.   For example, users would be reluctant to hit the delete key if they see their son's or daughter's name in the subject line of a message.  By automating the process of integrating spyware results with outgoing spam -- not a big deal, technically -- spammers could “personalize” spam to some degree and still generate high numbers of messages.

						   Windows enthusiasts speculated that Windows XP Starter Edition was a realignment of the software giant's Office and Windows releases with Office 2003 Service Pack 1 and Windows XP Service Pack 2 that would effectively re-launch both products; however, Windows XP Starter Edition is merely the formal name given to a no-thrills version of the operating system that will be distributed solely in Thailand and Malaysia.  The Information, Communications and Technology (ICT) program was crafted by the government of Thailand to assist low-income earners to be able to afford their own PCs.   While first declining to participate in ITC, Microsoft has since shifted its tactics and offered up pricing incentives, a stripped down version of Windows XP Home and a specialized version of Office XP.   A Microsoft spokesperson commented on the company's participation in ICT saying, "We look forward to seeing how this product will be received by Thai citizens, and the impact it will have on their efforts to enable access to technology."

      Microsoft is currently planning a new edition to the Windows XP family of operating systems, namely "Starter Edition". Starter Edition is the name of a previously announced effort to deliver a tailored and localized Windows product to Thailand and Malaysia, as part of Microsofts efforts to enable access to technology.  Previous rumours suggested that Windows XP Starter Edition would include a set of applications on top of the standard Windows XP installation (including Office 2003). We cannot confirm these reports but are awaiting a statement from Microsoft Press.

      U.S. investigators said on Wednesday they had arrested an America Online employee for stealing the Internet provider's customer list and selling it to a purveyor of "spam" e-mail.  Jason Smathers of Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, has been charged with stealing a list of 92 million AOL customer screen names and selling them to Internet marketer Sean Dunaway of Las Vegas, said David Kelley, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.  Dunaway, who has also been arrested, used the list to promote his online gambling operation and also sold the list to other spammers, Kelley said. An AOL spokesman said Smathers has been fired from the company.
