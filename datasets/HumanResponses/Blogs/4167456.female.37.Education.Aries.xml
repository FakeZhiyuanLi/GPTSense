       My house burned down today.       No, not my actual house. The house I was building in my heart; the house I wanted to live in. The house I was desperately wanting to make my home, never to pack again, never to change the locks ever.      And, it doesn't matter how the fire started. Maybe the wiring had been faulty all along and it was only a matter of time before *poof* !! Maybe. And, who am I kidding? It was drafty. And, it wasn't as comfortable as I wish it had been, although I did try to improve it.       It wasn't the best house. It needed paint and it was way, way off the main road so that if you didn't know it was there, you never saw it. But, it was mine. It was where I wanted to be. And, I'll believe this until the day I die, the foundation was strong.      Oh, god, how I loved that house. I loved the way it smelled. I loved the way it felt. It was just the perfect size and the color of caramel.      When it happened......I was devastated. Holy shit. Listen to me.      In his novella, "The Body," Stephen King writes:      "Speech destroys the functions of love, I think -- that's a hell of a thing for a writer to say, I guess, but I believe it to be true. If you speak to tell a deer you mean it no harm, it glides away with a single flip of its tail. The word is the harm. Love isn't what these asshole poets like McKuen want you to think it is. Love has teeth; they bite; the wounds never close."      That's how I feel right now. After I knew my house had burned, I cried like a baby. I was parked in a fucking bank parking lot and I cried, wailed, sobbed, moaned like a baby. And, it doesn't matter what I say, it doesn't matter how I put it or what language I use. The emotion wouldn't come across. The despair. The regret. The hopelessness. As much as I love words, they suck ass when trying to explain it.      I've always been pretty much teflon when it comes to emotions. My motto has always been that people will do what they want to do. And, if they don't do what you want them to do by nature....would you really want them to do what you want them to do if that's not what they would've done naturally? That's logic. It's rational and it's the sense I've always applied to my "relationships." If that's what you can call them.      Well, I lost someone today. They sailed out of my life with sails filled of self-righteousness and self-justification. And, I feel as if I'm left overboard to drown of anger and bitterness and hurt.      The tears are still there, waiting to come; waiting for a quiet moment when I'm sure that a passing motorist won't slow his car and motion to me to ask if I'm okay.       So....I'll cry my eyes out tonight. I'll mourn the loss of my home, the loss of my comfort and love.      Then.....tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and stop feeling sorry for myself. I'm going to clean my apartment. The first time in over a month!!! I'm going to clean my car. I'm going to go look for a part-time job. I'm gonna pluck my eyebrows, do my laundry, the dishes and shave my legs. I've been depressed and have been letting a lot of things go. Well....I'm homeless now. If there were ever a time when I've needed to make a new life for myself, it's now.       Tomorrow, I will wash my face, brush my teeth, dress as well as I can (which, admittedly, is not all that great - but decent) and go out into the world. I'm going to do my hair and I will not hang my head. I will create a different world for myself. A better one than I've had. And, in that world....one day....I'll build another house. A stronger house, with carefully installed wiring and fire extinguishers placed, strategically, all around. And, I will not shed one more tear over the dwelling that lays in ashes at my feet today. The home that, despite everyone's efforts, wasn't taken care of enough to keep it from burning. I will take a deep breath and walk quietly away from my heart's rubble.  And, I won't look back.  I won't.        But, that's tomorrow.

        What is it about working a normal work week that makes the weekend into a glittering diamond by Tuesday afternoon.  You would think the weekend was a mystical, oft rumored, not largely believed tale about freedom and sunny afternoons; of sunhats and white, flowing sun dresses and, of course, of afternoons that never end, of nights that never disappoint and of rest that is received in abundance.          There are no mistakes when you anticipate a weekend.  So many things will be done, so many people visited with; there will be time for all that you have to do.   Until the weekend comes and you remember all you have to do.          My big goal this weekend?  I want to find a part-time job.   I wish I could get  a temporary part-time job, but I can't find one, as of yet.          For some reason, I'm remembering my mother and sister's recent trip to the south of Texas to visit family.  It was a funeral and my mother, my sister and my father went.  The thing I was thinking about was their rental car.          I don't know how it happened, but they rented a non-smoking car.  My father and mother both smoke like trains.            When they got back from the trip, my mother insisted on cleaning the car and agonized over whether to tell the rental company about the smoking.   Dawn came and it was time to take the car back.  I followed them so I could bring them back in my car and before they went in, they stopped by my window.          "Okay," my mother said to my sister, "if they don't ask about it, we're not gonna tell them."     "Okay," said my sister.     "But," my mother's voice tensed up, "if they ask....well, we'll just have to be honest and tell them, 'Pos, mira...,'" my mother reverted to her native tongue in her distress, ".....nosostros, we tried to clean it out as well as we could, but my husband (I knew he'd come in as the patsy somehow) he doesn't like to go without smoking."     "Okay," said my sister.     "Poro, si no preguntan....no vamos a decir nada."     "Okay."          My mother, satisfied with the agreed-upon procedure, straightened her back and looked off toward the rental office, her expression- one ready for warfare.  They walked off.          I remember thinking...."You know, the second someone says 'smoke' my momma's gonna break down, exhausted by the duplicity and demand to be taken to jail for punishment."          I don't know why I was thinking about that today.  Maybe because I'm running low and cigarettes and have to decide if I want to buy more or not.  I definitely have to go grocery shopping.  Potatoes, jalapenos, onions, tomatoes, tortillas....all the fixings for a feast.  I've almost made it half-month.  I think I'm gonna make it.

      It was raining just an hour ago.  Now, it's sunny skies, yet again.  I've got my car today, so I don't really care if it rains, but just on principle, I like it to rain hard and to have that freshly scrubbed rain smell.   I like the wind to swirl it around, so that it hits the windows and the thunder to crash so loud and deep, that you feel the vibration of it through your toes.  I'm going to go to Ego's tonight.  I really shouldn't.  Even the $3 to get in is a lot of money for me these days, but I just love to see the poets get up and perform.  They're something else.

       It's 7:17am and I'm at work.  The mind is asking 'why'. The body is considering a mutiny. It was unavoidable, though. I have a doctor's appointment today at 10:30am.  Doctor's appointments for UT employees who ride the bus to work are troublesome and inconvenient things. Were it up to me, I would be able to go to the doctor on Saturday or I'd forever be going to emergency clinics. This is a follow-up type of thing, however, and I've rescheduled it twice.  I dreamt about my caramel boy last night. He's this guy that was in possession of the sweetest, smoothest, prettiest skin I've ever seen on a man (or woman, for that matter). He walked around like he was as hard as stone. So unapproachable. And, he is to a certain extent. Mentally and emotionally, there's no way to get near him. Ahhhh, but touch that skin and he's just like caramel. You know, you open that clear cellophane and you touch it. Before you unwrapped it, it seemed like a little hard nugget, then you put it in your mouth and aye caramba! it's soft and buttery and fragrant and rich and sweet. Deliciously sweet.  Ahem.  Um....anyway. What was I saying? Right. Doctor's appointment.  Well, whatever. It's gonna be hell having to get off campus, to my doctor's appointment, then back again. But, I love taking the bus if for no other reason than because I get to walk to Cesar Chavez in the evenings. Never underestimate the value of walking 20-30 minutes a day. If I do nothing else, I know, I've gotten my walk in. Plus, there's something sexy about walking down Congress, knowing I'm not a tourist, that I live and breathe among everyone there. That I have a right to my part of the sidewalk.

       I splurged today.   I bought some coffee.    Ahhhhhh, coffee.  Just a sip or two and it's as if I've been born again.    Of course, now I'll be up until midnight....but, who cares?      Tomorrow is Poetry Slam day.   Anyone in Austin reading this?      Ego's - Wednesday nights.    It's $3 to get in and it's highly entertaining.  Trust me on this one.  Usually, I tend to get bored before the shouting dies down, but this happens to be a very pumped up shin-dig.         See the young devils    in their armour of night   Don't ask them their business   they'll show you their might   Whisper loudly with vile breath   And, you may hear sweetness in kind   Take care of your skin   before you begin   For the darkness is coming tonight.      Okay, okay....that was just me doing that free-flowing thing.  Don't worry.  I'm not quoting any of the real poets.      They're good.  And, hot!  Some of them, anyway.  But, mostly, they're just really good.  There's one thing that I truly respect about artists and actors and poets and anyone that gets up on the stage to perform for random strangers.   And, it's not always the material or the ability of the act or performer.     It's their own fierce belief in themselves.    They may suck.  They may get booed.  The joke, act, play may fall flat, but they're up there.  They're trying.    And, that's admirable.  You've gotta give it to them.

        All the different colors and fonts to choose from!      I'm having a good day. It's similar to the feeling one has the first morning after they've been sick. Not deathly sick or anything. I'm not getting morbid. But, irritatingly sick, with allergies or something. They've been able to function, but they've been snotty and sniffly, alternatingly feeling hot and feverish to cold and shivering. That kind of sick. Nothing major, just present enough to make you feel achy and dopey.      I feel clear and rested and relieved that my Kleenex can be put away, at least for a while. So many things are up in the air right now. Where I'll be living, my money situation, etc. But, I feel as if the major things have been sorted out at last. And, that's a relief.       I know that I am single and don't mind that I am. Did I? No, not really. I wanted someone and....I think they wanted me, but the situation was one that neither one of us could figure out good enough for the other, so.... What can you do? I mean, really....without exercising some force of will on the other person, it's just a situation that has no solution.      I know that the next place I live will be the place I stay at for a long time. I will refuse to budge. I am ready to settle down and to begin thinking about longevity and how I want my life to be, who I want to share it with, what I want to be doing.       I've decided that I want to be a better sister and daughter. I want to be a better friend to the small group of sweet, though bewildering individuals that I call friends now. I want to make more friends and get out into the world, experience whatever comes my way; things that I haven't even thought of now. Well, except line dancing. I've seen people do it (hundreds of them! all at the same time) and it's just not for me.       I want to write more. Not for profit or success, but because it has been the one constant in my life that I've always taken for granted. And, I don't think I should. I think it should be like brushing your teeth or trimming your toenails (without the toe-jam). When I write I discover so much about myself. And, it's not always good, but helps to shovel out the bad of what's inside, to get it out and on paper so that I can look at it and realize that it (whatever's wrong at the time) isn't a big, hairy monster that I have to hide from, alter my life to avoid, but just ordinary crappy circumstances that everyone's been in. I want to start painting again. I am not a painter the way I am a writer, but I CAN paint. I can create something out of nothing and it becomes something worthy of interest....at least mine, anyway.      I'm having such a love-fest with myself lately. I've got a great heart. Sure, there are others who'll disagree with me, but, who the hell are THEY? I'm here to tell you that I've got a great, big heart and there isn't anything I wouldn't do for the people I love. I'm not the best person, but I'm pretty damn good. And, besides....who IS the  best  person? Have you met them? Is it you? *gasp* If it is, congratulations. Cuz, I know for sure it isn't me. :-P And, that's okay. No one's perfect.

        I turned my digital cable on!    Me.    All by myself.    Yeah....it was tough....but, I managed.     (Sniff)    When I set my mind on something...nothing stands in my way.  I'm cool like that.            There's so many things I should be doing right now.  I should put away the laundry that seems destined to meld with my pink chair.  I could be packing up some things.  I could be working on my story.  Yes, I'm working on a story.  I fancy myself an "author".  Ooooh la  la.          Mondays are a strange time for me, though.  I don't ever want to do anything on Mondays.  "Rainy days and Mondays al-ways get me-e dowwwwn"            Gosh, I'm so old.            Remember all those songs from your past that were so beautiful at the time...so cool and meaningful, but that are, now, lame and death to your coolness if overheard within 10 feet from you?          Anything from Barry Manilow is like gonorrhea now, when in the 70's, it was the height of soul.  The Bee-Gee's, even.  They can still be heard, but only if you're miming Saturday Night Fever or, at the very least, making an attempt to show how uncool you think the music is now.  Kenny Rogers, of recent Reno 911 fame, is delegated to the country channels and those ominous "soft rock" stations - that category where you're not sure what you'll find.          There are so many songs I miss that I haven't heard in ages.  Bachman Overdrive!   Remember? Anyone?  How 'bout Kansas?  Asia?  Black Cherry?  Elton John before the return to conventionality?            Crocodile Rock!   "I remember when Rock was young......."     Dust In the Wind?    Anyone?     Slip-sliding Away!  Paul Simon....come on, you know it.          All those songs were so innocent.  Or it seemed that they were at the time, anyway.  Not to knock today's music.  How else are you going to grab the attention of people these days?          I'm gonna move into a new apartment soon.  They pay for extended cable , which means that I can get the extended package - the one with the music and only pay for the charge after what the apt complex pays for.  I don't think I said that right, but I'm excited.  Let me just leave it at that.  I type over 70 wpm and I hardly ever stop to proofread, but I'm sure I got the idea across.  That extended-extended package has the music channels that I long for.  I used to leave it on all the time when I had more money and was insane.  Now, I just don't have as much money.    :)               I'm excited.      Soon, after I move, I will not want to move for a very long time.  I will want to settle down, maybe get a mate and have some chil-uns.   I know I've been dreading this move,b ut I welcome it now.  I want to leave where I've been.  I want to start new and fresh.  I'll miss this place, but where I'm going will be better.  I'll make it better.          I think I will pack a little.  The month is almost half-way over.  I can't wait.

       Ever wake up with something burning in your head that won't leave you alone until you do it? That was me this morning. I woke up at 4:45am! Who does that? For what purpose? I tried to go back to sleep, fought the urge to wake up and do what I first thought about when I woke up, but the idea wouldn't go away. Finally, I ended up just opening my eyes and doing it, but then I couldn't go back to sleep. It's 6:30am now and I've eaten my cereal, toast and coffee. I have to catch the bus at 7:00am.  What creates our desire while we sleep? Does anyone have a clue? Why is it that some thoughts, once they make their way into your subconscious, have the power to disturb, interrupt, dictate your actions? And, other thoughts don't seem to have any power at all.  My chones are still on the pink chair.

             Ahhhhh! Coffee and rice pudding.      It's my morning snack. I've just gotten back from walking around Town Lake and grocery shopping and am about to bake a cake and clean my apartment (I am....I AM!).       Walking down the trail I look at all the people running and in different phases of exertion. I'm bouyed (is that the right word?) by everyone I see, just about. There are women that look twice my age running. Running! I've dabbled with the accelerated trot, but....running? Well, let's just say that I've got a dodgy hip and am a bit uncertain about how things may manifest if I undertake that sort of activity. I feel so heavy when I start walking. After I've been at it for 30 or so minutes I feel lighter. Anyone feel like that? I feel like my lungs can process air quicker...fleeter! My legs don't feel as flappy, my back doesn't hurt. After 30 minutes I feel like I can walk for days. Do I contemplate running at this point? Ummmmm, no. I don't. Maybe when I lose more weight I'll feel at the start of my walk, they way I now do 30 minutes into it. I don't know. It's enough for me to walk right now, though. It helps me feel as if I haven't spent the entire day in my apartment. Which I usually have.       I went to H.E.B. afterwards. When I got in line to check out, I found myself behind a group of what was, obviously, Mexican nationals. A group of 4-5 of them. And, not one of them had a woman. No, really. I can tell these things. It's easy. I looked at what they were buying. Everything they had could be cooked on a grill or in a microwave. They had tortillas (gas stove owners - bastards!), meat, ramen noodles, TV dinners, meat, beer, toilet paper and....oh, yeah....meat. Plus, it's a dead giveaway that they were the ones doing the shopping. Shopping, by and large, is a woman's job. We're the ones that know how to cook 80% of the time. We've read the specials. We'll take the extra trip to another store for 2 or 3 items if they're cheaper than at the one we're at now (which reminds me - I've got to go to City Market for vegetables and fruit --- Yes, HEB is cleaner, it's got fresher produce, better selection - but, believe me on this - City Market is cheaper -- cheaper by lots).      I have a lot of work to do. I need to clean my apartment, put last week's laundry away (it is currently strewn all across my pink chair and showing signs of dwindling - I pick off of it daily - but, do I put the clothes up? No), and clean out my car. I've got to bake my cake! Do any of you know that it takes approximately $3 to make a cake? The mix is about $1.50, the icing is $1. Throw in the price of an egg and some milk, butter to grease the pan and electricity to bake it and....voila, mon ami, you've got yourself a cake.      It'll bake while I clean. I'm always surprised by the extent to which my apartment gets dirty. I think I'll pack up some stuff. What I want to do is try to weed some things out. Women build homes. Men live in houses. Ever notice that? Unless they're gay (like my brother - he has a very nice house, by the way) or they're the rare ones that like for things to look nice (and, in that case, they want the more expensive things like leather and entertainment systems)....it is usually the woman that drags home things to put in her house.       Well, I've done enough dragging home, I think (she said, taking a look around). It's time to weed out what isn't necessary. I'll be moving soon. I've lived in this apartment on S 1st for nearly a year now and I'm going to miss it. I like that no one can see inside (I live on the 3rd floor). I like that trees hang just outside my window and I can leave the windows wide open (although I shut them now that it's so hot). I like having a washer and dryer. I've liked sitting on my patio and drinking my coffee, smoking my cigarettes (which I'm thinking of quitting). I'll miss this place. I don't want to go. But, go, I must. I've found an apartment that is $475 a month, with free extended cable and paid water/trash/waste water. I, currently, pay $567 and pay for the cable and water. If you factor in all that, I'll be paying about $150 less a month! And, let me tell you. I'm one poor bitch right now. I can't wait. I can't fucking wait! Also, I think my contract with SBC, the wonderful entity that allows me to write this right now, will be up in September, so I'm gonna do away with that and, maybe, get Road Runner. So, that's another $50-70 off.       I know I'm babbling. I feel no guilt. No one's telling you to read this. Someone once told me that he saw no point in a person's daily minutiae. Well, I agree. There really IS no point. But, it can also go both ways. Confusing, I know. Let me expand.       I don't think a person's private thoughts should all be for an audience.    But, I also don't think a person's private world should be dictated by an audience, either.      What you do in life should be your world, for better or worse; flawed or whole; sinful or saintly. It should be yours, not to be explained or apologized for.      This is mine.       I'll fart and tell you about it, I may describe the smell. I'll try to capture my intense love and affection for my father, the archetype for all men after him. Viejo! And, how I revere and admire my mother. And, how I can still see them as human. So, horribly, terribly, comically human. I'll make many....many mistakes. But, I'll make you seem wise in comparison. I'll make bad judgments; bad fashion choices; typos. Mine will not be a world where everything is done "just so". I don't have answers to important questions. I don't give good driving instructions. I'll burn my potatoes, get flat tires, bad haircuts and stomache gas.....which leaves us where we started. I'll put this all down, not because I'm vain (I mean....I AM vain, but that's not the reason to write). I write because it calms me. It clears my head. It is the Milk-of-Magnesia for my soul. And, you have a front-row ticket. Aren't you glad you stayed?

      My feet are a mess!  You know, I just can't win.  I am missing a female gene somewhere.  I just know it.   I try to groom.    I DO.  I try.    I shower, I periodically comb the hair, I take the googly stuff out of my eyes.    I dress, put on make-up and deordorant.    I try.  I give it, if not my all,  a lot.   Since I started my new job, I've been walking home.  I've got the nasty hammer toes now.  My heels all have callouses on them, I have scarred places from where my shoes rubbed too much.  They just look all jacked up!  Femininity keeps eluding me.  It's not my fault, either.

      Let's talk about something that I'm finding increasingly annoying.  Weight.  The reason I find it annoying is because it taps into a primal dimension in the psyche and the results are raw and harsh. There's no logic or rationale that will prevent cruelty toward those who are overweight or will take away the stigma of being a fatty.  I'm 5'2", 170. I am on the downside of being a fatty (I used to weigh close to 200 in the winter of 2002), I think - although no one can truly estimate the weight scale of public acceptance, it CAN be measured by looks received and small favors bestowed and, paradoxically, by female aggression (if you are a female). 25 - 30 pounds may not sound like a lot, but the weight I've lost has been gradual and I've worked out more, walked constantly. There's a noticeable difference.  I am, at once, both proud of how I look and flattered by the growing attention I've begun to receive from the opposite sex and dismayed by the fact that a mere 25-30 pounds should make that much of a difference in life. I am dismayed because the men who approach me these days seem to be very decent (well, not ALL of them, but a majority of them, anyway), but I can't shake the feeling that simply by not approaching me sooner they've disappointed me already, they've come up short before even trying.  I, personally, did not like how big I was getting. I couldn't put my arms down without feeling the rolls around my tummy. That's an ugly feeling that I didn't want to have. I knew my job was a factor, a major one and since I think dieting is the same thing as telling yourself you're going to shovel water out of a sinking ship --- but, only for so long, then you'll quit, I don't diet. I was unhappy with myself, how I looked and felt, so......I quit my job. I turned my world upside down, but now I'm in a position where I walk every day and it's part of getting home. The weight is coming off faster and I am keeping it off and will continue to do so. So...I'm very happy with my situation. I'm very happy that I'm losing weight. That doesn't mean that I'm still not dismayed by the public response and perception. And, the dismay I feel is just compounded by the fact that I know.... I KNOW reality will not change perception.  What I mean is that, look around, America is getting fatter. Even the teenagers in their hoochie, cha-cha-cha get ups are rounder and softer. Our young children are obese. And, overweight men are seeping into the entertainment and media we view on tv like water out of a fist. Overweight women like Camryn Manheim are a necessary novelty, something that Americans can point at and declare we're not in denial, but they're far from being an honest portrayal of what women today look like.  I believe that there are more women who are overweight than men. I say this for 2 reasons. 1) Because women are considered overweight at a less percentage of fat and 2) It is still the tradition of this country for the man to roam free while the woman is straddled to the home, thus making it harder to keep weight off. Having said this, however, I still think that there are a lot of fat men roaming the streets. White men, Black men, Hispanic men. They've all, regardless of race (with the exception of Asians/Indians), getting more and more overweight.  But, even though this is a reality, it's the woman's value that is affected in direct proportion to how much they weigh. Weight, in women, is like location with real estate. And, the less you weigh, the better the location. And, what I find irritating and worthy of scorn is the look of surprised realization on men when they meet me, like they've just discovered a dated, run-down 3 bedroom house for sale in central Austin going for $50,000 (it's old, needs paint, a lot of work - but...it's still almost prime real estate). You have to understand. I've never been married. I have no kids. I'm a veteran and a college graduate. I'm funny, I cook, I'm warm, independent, loyal and I'm smart. Plus (and this one seems to get a lot of men going), I live alone. With the last 5 pounds I've lost, I seem to have wandered just north of Stassney in Central Austin. Another 10 and I'll inch my way across Ben White. In 20, I"ll be prime, north of Oltorf, between s 1st and Lamar. If 30 comes off......hell, man, it'll be like owning a bungalow on the river.  But, here's the thing. Men react in a collective wave, almost as if they need to know another man sees me as being worth to hit on. Okay, most men do. At 190, I didn't have a specific group of men fawning over me. Neither at 180. Suddenly, at 170, I've got the shy guys and the bit sleazy guys hitting on me. I've got the older Mexican men that pass by in their battered trucks and honk at me. They smile and wave leerily, like I'm going to flag them down as if their attention has been just what I needed all day and I feel the need to reward them in some way.  And, the worse thing to know is that I'll never again have a particular knowledge about a man.  The knowledge that he'll be with me even though I'm fat, that he'll see me for how smart I am, that he'll want to hold me even though I can feel the rolls of my tummy against my inner arm.  I'll never again have that.   I look around me now at all these shy and bit sleazy men and think to myself (to paraphrase the immortal words of Antonio Fargas in the movie "Car Wash"), "Baby, I was more man than you'll ever be and more woman than you'll ever get..." at 200 lbs!     I resent that it is only now that I'm getting attention and I know the resentment will only grow with the attention.   I, like all creatures, big and small, want to be loved, but how genuine is that love if the owner/bestower of that love wouldn't think to give me the time of day right now, let alone 20 pounds ago.    But, I know it's coming.   I've not always been big.  I used to be average, but I have big boobies and long hair, that equals sexy in a lot of cultures, so I've never gone wanting for male attention.  As the weight comes off and I encounter behaviour I recognize from the male species, I realize that I liked being liked for my mind (once upon a time) a whole lot more than potentially being loved for my body in the future.  And, I don't know what to do about it.

      My best meal....and, I know I'm pigeonholing myself into a certain demographic, but I can't help it....is Olive Garden's salad & breadsticks with a side of alfredo sauce, some calamari and a decadent desert of cappuccino and tiramisu!!!  Man....dating would be worth it just to get taken out for a meal like that.

      It's happened. Yes, it is going on right now.  I've stopped smoking. Notice, I did not say I quit. I have stopped in the same way that a driver will stop his car at a dead end. I didn't intend to, never really wanted to, but I have.  It's interesting because when you don't smoke, you get an opportunity to find out how smoking affects your life and what you would do differently if you didn't smoke. Smoking takes up a lot of time. Especially since I am one of strangely weak, ambivalent closet smokers that won't give it up, but doesn't want to get scolded every time I light up, so I do it away from everyone, in secret, alone. I don't do it in the dark because that could lead to scorching. BUT, I do keep doing it and that leads to a lot of wasted time, for me, anyway.  A polite or closet smoker has to go away from everyone in order to smoker. So....you walk/travel/hop/skip/jump, whatever, to your nearest designated smoking downwind area. You have to stay there ( you cannot pass GO, you cannot collect $200) until you've finished the cigarette. The amount of time varies for different people. When I smoke, I smoke. It takes about 3 minutes (but, then I gotta walk back, brush the teeth, wash the hands, etc). Some people smoke the way casual drinkers drink. It's not the cigarette that is alluring (although, I'm sure the addiction is there), it's the presence of it. My mother can make a cigarette linger for up to 15-20 minutes. All she does is lights it and walks away, leaving it in an ashtray (ashtrays! You ever notice how they're not being made as extravagantly as they used to?). For a lot of people, like my mother, it's an unconscious thing like breathing, biting your nails or a facial tick.  It may be because she was raised right when cigarettes took the world by storm, back in a time when you wouldn't dream of telling anyone to put their cigarette out, no matter where they were. From what I understand, cigarettes took off when Phillip Morris offered them to GI's during the 2nd World War as a means of fighting boredom and hunger in one fell swoop. Like I said, they take up a lot of time. Smoking jackets were invented to keep your clothes from smelling of smoke, that's why you put them on over your clothes. Smoking was viewed as sexy or provocative in early movies (hell, even in modern ones - let's be honest). No mention was ever made of the smell or that people might find it offensive and I think that's the root of the problem. Or, rather, the complaint.   It's the smell.     I'm not advocating smoking. Believe me. I'm a smoker and I don't like smelling it. I don't like the smell on my clothes. I get so dizzy and fuzzy-headed when parents come to visit because they both smoke soooooo much, you have to pass out after a while. You cannot be unaffected by it. I don't wanna date a smoker, definitely don't wanna kiss one. They're too expensive, they create litter, make you into a social outcast and gives you the nastiest, unnatural brown phlegm - something wayy too gross to have been imagined before actually ever experiencing it. Make no mistake. This is not pro-smoking.  However, I do think that smoking is the fat of addictions.  I mean, as far as appearances go, nothing will bring about more snickers, more unwanted, unsolicited comments about the way you look than being fat. Being fat affects your social life, your career advancement, your health and your self-esteem. But, so does being crippled. So does being ugly. So does being a minority (the health factor being a bit of a sketchy example - but go with it).  Smoking is a disgusting and unhealthy habit. So is picking your nose. So is chewing tobacco. So is drinking. So is cocaine and any other drug. But, it's smoking that gets the public lynching. It's smoking that is made so universally unacceptable and, more importantly, because of the smell, so easy to condemn. Now, an argument can be made that the smell is not just a smell, it's the way the drug gets into your system and affects your health. And, that would be correct. Touche.  However....what argument would you make for drinking in public? Then, getting into a vehicle to drive on city streets alongside pedestrians? Consumption of any drug, regardless of how minor, is a responsibility that the consumer makes, but one that will also affect the public. I think that people feel free to comment or counsel you on your smoking (everything from asking you, "You smoke?" as if they missed the memo you sent out, to saying, in a benign and righteous voice, "You know, you shouldn't smoke, it's a disgusting habit") in the same way people feel free to comment on what you're eating when you're fat ("Whoa, girl! You sure you want the burger? We got salads as well." or "You know that frozen pot pie is about half saturated fat, don't you?" Like I give a toss - I've eaten menudo, people! You can't scare me).  **Side note** Don't you hate those food people. I  really  fucking hate those people. I used to be fatter than I am now and I'd run into those types of people a lot; as if certain, particular people around me had some personal stock in how I looked and my appeal to the general public. Hey, I had a nightmare job I rarely left, I had more money than I do now, I ate out more, I sat more, I did less. Hell, let's face it! EVERYONE, if they live in contemporary American society will struggle with weight unless they life a lifestyle that allows them the time and opportunity to actually burn off the calories they consume. In a world where the internet is becoming more indispensible every day and online activities are becoming more enticing (see Aug 19th Time), no one is getting up out of the chair too much. But, I just had to say how I hate those people. Those smug, intentionally callous individuals that feel free to swoop over you and your meal placing judgement, taking aim and firing, like a paid hit man, taking pleasure in your stuttering and momentary incapacity as you sit there wondering what about you makes you easy prey for these traveling, self-important and bloated vultures.  My point about the smoking is that if it didn't smell, you wouldn't hear the uproar about it so much. You might see groups pop up like MASS (Mothers Against Sadistic Smokers), but very little else. You'd get that indulgent, confused impatience you encounter with drinking (It's not the drinking that's bad.....it's the management of it).  As for me, I think once the month is up and I have more money (although, I don't think I'll have money for smoking since I have to move), my smoking habit may have been affected. Sitting here, I don't feel the urge to smoke. The urge also doesn't make too much of a fuss after eating. I find if I breathe deeply, maybe chew on something, the urge disappears, but I was never too much of a smoker as it was. It WAS or IS a habit, though. Smoking, the more I think about it, is about consuming. It's like eating in that it's a very personal and intimate thing. Your body is involved. It's being fed. Deep breathing still feeds the body, chewing gives the illusion of consuming. That takes care of the addiction part (it's the smaller of the two), but the habit part is hard to break. What do I do with the 15 minute breaks during work? When I'm having trouble with a sentence and I need to step away from my work for a while.....where am I supposed to go?  hee  I'm saying it hasn't been that big of a deal. And......that makes me think.

      I remember wanting to learn how to play chess.  I remember wanting to be really good at it.  I'm not sure why.  It has that elusive quality to it, doesn't it?  It gives the impression that if you're good at chess, you're good at other things.  It's a game that insinuates the need to use more of your faculties than, say....jacks (remember jacks?  that game with the ball and those strange metal-mixed, small, multi-pointed things you picked up off of the floor between bounces of the ball?  What happened to that?  What happened to that game?  Do people even play that anymore?)  My brother, Chris (the gay one), taught me how to play chess.  Of course he did.  There was no one else.  If something different and exciting drifted into my world, it was because my brother enticed it there.  When I was growing up, there was something different about him.  Oh, it wasn't how you probably think it was.  He wasn't effeminate.  He's quite butch, actually (to use the native lingo).  He's more manly, more responsible and more sturdy than most men I know.    He's the one that will take charge when things go wrong.    To put it in perspective - He's the one that escorted my mother down the aisle when our uncle, her brother, died and we attended his funeral.  My father and other brother (the "real" men of the family) were huddled in the back, as far as possible from the casket.  I don't think they knew how to nor wanted to try to comfort my mother.  I've often said that if I have any sense of decency, I've inherited it from my mother.  I inherited my love of laughter, my facial expressions and sense of humor from my father.  But, I owe my salvation to my brother.  To my brother and his homosexuality.  Have you ever noticed that a person's gifts may open doors, but it's often their flaws, their adversities that dictate which door they enter?  There's never been anything particularly "special" about my brother to anyone outside of the family.  He can't play guitar like the 2nd coming of Jimi Hendrix.  He never excelled at sports.  He's not a writer or an artist.  He's not rich or a savvy businessman.    He's not saintly.  He's not the devil.  He's an average guy.  Had he not been gay, he would've finished school, gone to Odessa college, gotten a good job, married a girl from town and had a couple of kids.    Had he not been gay, everything would've been different.  For all of us.  First of all, no one's life would've been disrupted.  My mother's heart wouldn't have been broken.  My father wouldn't have been mortified.  All of our lives would've been okay (or whatever passes as "okay").  Ahhhh, but he was gay and, as a result, as early as 6th grade, he affected my life in a way that I wouldn't see for a long time to come.   He affected me, my life, and the lives of everyone around him for the better.  He widened, slashed open, our little, destined for Odessa cliche, world.  And, everytime I look out at the river in Austin from one of the bridges that crosses it, I think on the influences that have brought me here.    The first time I saw Austin was when I was 16 and visiting my gay brother while he attended UT having run away, too ashamed to stay in his home town.   Before that trek, I'd have gotten a hard-on at the mention of Pecos, I never went anywhere.    I remember breathing in the Austin air, looking out on the river, and, for the first time, becoming fully aware of a world outside the one I knew.  Maybe it's the river (if I may have a Twainian moment) that brings home that feeling of connectivity.  Whatever it is, I felt it that day and I feel it now.

      I've never really tried to quit smoking. Of course, quitting, at this juncture, is not about health, community or anything else. It's about money. I, simply, cannot afford it. I think this will be my last day smoking. At least for this month. And I'm not concerned about it at all. I have a worse addiction.  I have had allergies all weekend. They both make me sluggish and keep me from sleeping, leaving me tired and irritable, achey and snotty. I haven't slept a lot this weekend. I took Nyquil and went to bed around 8pm last night determined to get some rest.  The tight noose of addictions can make its presence known even a month after you've let them go.  Sunday nights. I hate Sunday nights. I hate them because I used to look forward to them so much. Now, no matter what I do or how tired I am, on Sunday nights I am awake and restless and longing to occupy my time as I used to. And, it takes everything in me to sleep, to find some rest, to push from my mind what Sunday used to mean. I miss my Sunday nights.
