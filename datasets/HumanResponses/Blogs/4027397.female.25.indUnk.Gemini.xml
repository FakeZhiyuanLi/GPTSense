      A student at UC Berkeley, William studies Civil Engineering, but his dream is to make music his career. William has true talent, and has captured the hearts of Americans across the country who watched him sing and dance his heart out on Tuesday, January 27. Since his TV debut, William has gathered a large fan base. Nobody ceases to be amused by his comical dance moves and earnest rendition of "She Bangs". Because we respect William's true talent and comical ability, we have decided to create this fan club dedicated to William himself. Quoted from  urlLink http://www.williamhung.net/   I am so sorry  but I really feel shame on you.

      I feel I am just an idiot&nbsp;at work. To be honest, I am not up to standard, made a lot of mistakes, and careless. I don't want to be a stupid but I think I am being it right now. I'll give my selfself maximum a month to be like that.&nbsp;Afterwards, I have to correct myself into a useful person. I don't want to be a burden to my colleagues. I know I am really lack of experience but I won't use it as my excuse anymore.  I kept thinking of what had happened yesterday, and I really hope Sai-lun could stay. I really want to say sorry to you as I couldn't help you in any aspect.  I failed to be "Amelie" yesterday!

      I am in a very bad mood. I couldn't tell when does it&nbsp;starts, but it&nbsp;has been&nbsp;for a long time since the Year of Monkey. The past half year was a very tough time to our family. I feel I'm lucky in all sense of my life. On the other hand, I also feel so sorry for my auntie, uncle and cousin. I keep thinking about my poor auntie, counsin Tony, his daughters Prisiclla and Crystal since I visited Tony and family yesterday. I don't understand why they need to face such a hard time as they are just one of the ordinary and kind people in the world. From their experiences, I understand that I don't want to have any regrets in my life. I need to do everything I want to do as soon as I could.&nbsp;All I want to do now is travelling. I believe this is the best way of learning life and god.&nbsp;Besides, I want to be&nbsp;a person&nbsp;like "Amelie". My wishes should not be&nbsp;too difficult to achieve, right?   However, I am still in a bad mood now. Can anyone help me to get rid of this bad mood???

      Another boring day in NCWCC. I've finished all the assigment by Teresa. Unfortunately, my roster is 0900-1800 in this sunny Saturday. I feel that I am useless again as I could help nothing to my colleagues. What I could do now is daydreaming and listening music until the end of the day.  I am listening Graham Coxon's album "Happiness in Magazine". It made me think of the happy time in England, including watching his live show in HMV, Oxford Street, and my visit to Chelsea Football Club. It cheers me up a little bit.  By the way, tonight is the Asian Cup Final (China vs Japan). I really worry there will be any violence happened in Beijing. I don't have any preference on which team to win the Cup. I just want everything could be go on peace without any trouble.    I hope everythings run smoothly in this afternoon.
