      Couldn't blog yesterday. Not that I was busy, infact reached home earlier than usual. Satiated my hunger and slept after some chatting with my Sister. (Shez a great character. Will blog about her someday.)      Attended TIME classes this morning after a gap of a week. Seems, the classes were held everyday this week. I have never missed 2 classes in a row before. Neway, nuthing much happened during my absence.       Was lazy this morning after the class. Never in the mood to start to office. A good discussion on Indian Cricket is happening among Arvind, Sri and Me. We used to have many such discussions when in College. We used to commute in the now gone sub urban trains daily. It was fun. I still remember a debate in the class on "Shud culture be preserved ?" It was one hot debate betwenn Sri and Arvind and we really enjoyed. Sri do u remember ???      Just realised that it is 1 PM and time for lunch. Planning to do some meaningful work in the post lunch session.      Got my hands on a copy of "Katradhum Petradhum" by Sujatha. Planning to finish that this weekend along with "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest".

       Wait!!! This post has nothing to do with Spirtualism.   Gyan Vaishnav is the restaurant where I had dinner today. Shankar who is otherwise a very lousy person suggested this place for a team treat.&nbsp;GV is a Punjabi restaurant but pure veg. Situated near the Thousand Light's signal, it can accomodate 25 people. They have a&nbsp;good Punjabi cuisine. 8 of us had gone there. Don was at his best. A hardcore non veggie, he had two rounds of starters (all of us had) 2 rounds of Tandoori and Rasamalai.   The food tasted good. "Rabri Rasamali" was excellent and so was "Punjabi Di Beer". I had two mugs of the latter which is nothing bud Masala buttermilk. I did not look for the individual rates at it was someone who was paying. 1500/- for a group of 8 is reasonable.

      End of another long day and another day has passed studying nothing. The whole day was spent in some report generation and training.&nbsp; Where is this leading me to ? No complaints abt the job. Good sal, growing company, excellent work culture, and no dress code (i like the last the most among everything). But is this what I want ?   Shud gear up for AIMCAT 503 this Sunday. Still having a couple of chapters to finish in Math. Also shud tune my DI fundas.  Spent the last one hr at Office working on&nbsp; my blog. Some cosmetic work. Am trying to get the shoutbox and side bar proper.   So tomorrow Ind vs SL and my office recreation club is again telecasting the match for us. Telecasting matches in our office has a bad influence on the performance of Indian team. Everytime they show matches, India&nbsp; lose badly. Shud do something abt this. Planning to leave early tomorrow from office.  I have seen some blogs wonderfully written. Mine would not be upto that standard (am being humble here). I wud defenitely try to emulate those standards.  This post is so incoherent. Well, am half asleep and before I bang my head on the Keyboard,&nbsp;"GOOD Nite"

      Am in the office now. Having loads of work to do. Report generation, analysis, training ...    Probably I need to cut down on my vetti browsing and do work more.     Watched the Ind Pak match yesterday. The Indians were far from good. Ordinary bowling, pathetic fielding and shabby batting. Sachin has yet again proved that he is not a match winner these days. Played a rash shot when the team was in a bad spot. Pathan was batting sensibly and all Sachin needed was to score some brisk ones and twos. The team had 240, the score they needed to earn a bonus point as their target and not 301. India should beat Srilanka to enter the finals. Tough job in hand.    Also watched Spiderman 2. Nuthing much in the movie except picturisation. Infact, the movie had some shades of Tamil and Telugu movies.     Am lagging behind in my CAT preparation. Time to catch up.

I have been reading a lot of blogs and thought why shoudn't I have one ?&nbsp; Also I felt it was high time that I improve my writing skills.   More info on my next post.   Time to hit the bed. It is Monday already.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Watched the movie Azhagiya Theeyae at Mini Udhayam. Jo and I hit the theatre at around 1 30 for the 2 30 show . The counter showed House Full sign by 1 45.  The story revolves around Prasanna an aspiring director who waits for the right break in the cine field. The heroine is Navya Nair, the third actress from God's own country to enter into Kollywood. The heroine wants dosen't want to marry because of her inherent hatred towards the male clan. Her father wants her to marry Prakash Raj. She seeks help from her friend's brother who inturn approaches Prasanna to help her. Prasanna lies to Prakash Raj that Navya and he are lovers. The consequences of this lie forms the rest of the movie.  Prasanna has done a wonderful job as the hero and Navya is refreshing. She resembles actress Rohini a lot. Prakash Raj has dun a wonderful cameo. The three friends of the hero fit into their respective characters like a 'T'. Music by Ramesh Vinayagam is good, but I seriously wonder why he sings most of the songs. On the whole a good entertainer and it deserves the 46 marks given by  urlLink Anantha Vikatan.   Watched "Kanedhire Thondrinal" where Simran looked too good. A good movie on friendship and love. The director of this movie has a great sense of music. He got the best out of Deva in this movie (except Sallomiya... all other songs are Deva's original tunes and good too) and then introduced Harris Jeyaraj in Majnu.  As if Navya and Simran are not enough, Sneha was there to torment me in "Yeh ... Nee Romba Azhaga Irukka". A typical Vasanth flick, where one can get a lot of sweet and cute scenes to watch though the main storyline wud be bad. Sneha was so beautiful in this movie. There was nuthing much in that movie except Sneha and songs. Vasanth is one director who gives so much importance to songs in all his films. Dunno why he never worked with Mastero Illayaraja after "Keladi Kanmani". "Keladi kanmani" is one of the best movies to have hit the screen. After that he gave two more hits in "Asai" and "Nareukku Ner" but both lacked the "Keladi Kanmani" quality.  On the whole I had an "Azhagana Weekend"

      Thursday was a very bad day for me. First, had some block in my left ear. I cud hardly hear anything. Thought that water had gone in because of extensive swimming. Had a tough time in office. The biggest difficulty was to hold my mobile in my right hand.  Then came a bigger blow when I learnt that my hard disk was corrupted beyond recovery. Arnd 20 GB of data and songs gone. 5 yrs of hardwork. Nuthing much can be done. Infact I was planning to exchange my comp last week but postponed it so that I cud write the data on a CD.  Neway, waiting for my new computer. Hope to get that done this week end. Need to discuss the paisa detais with Appa.  I plan to blog on movies and music as well. I am big fan of Tamil Film Music and Illayaraja, SPB and  urlLink Karthik  in particular. I do watch a lot of movies. Will write reviews of movies in future.  Had a bad AIMCAT503. Preparing for 504. Preparing for CAT while working is really difficult. But that is what pressure is all about. Need to crack the CAT.

       'Lynndie England'.... rings a bell? Yes!! The Abu Ghraib fame woman soldier who posed a smiley face for the camera with her thumbs up, as if shooting the genitals of Iraqi detainees and with dog leashes, is back in news, and I'm afraid this could be worse.  CNN reports:        	     Quote:   	 	 	   Arthur, a military investigator testified Lynndie England told him that "it was just for fun". Arthur also said "They didn't think it was that serious. ... They didn't think it was that big a deal. They were joking around". 	        To top it all, she is 7 months pregnant.  So much for her dignity and motherhood.  Now read this ...       She is one of seven members of the 372nd Military Police Company who have been charged with abusing detainees at Abu Ghraib.  A hearing officer, Major Charles Ransome, later recommended that the charges of indecent acts and cruelty and maltreatment be  dropped .
