      Do you ever wish you were somewhere else?&nbsp; I mean so badly you think of running away.&nbsp; I just wonder what life would be like if I&nbsp;gave up everything and split.&nbsp; Why didn't I ever backpack through Europe?&nbsp; I might be living in Greece.&nbsp; I may not have a large home, car, designer clothing, or an appointment at a day spa, but damn I would be living the dream.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are a rich, good looking man with an accent and would like to run away with someone the total opposite of you, then I am your girl.   Well, back to life.&nbsp; I got my hair cut (beautiful as always).&nbsp; My hair is my one thing of beauty.&nbsp; I told my hairdresser that I must have been a very beautiful, skinny, fabulous, filthy rich woman in my last life, and I did something very very bad!!!!!!&nbsp; Atleast God had mercy and left the great hair.&nbsp; I did get a great makeover (I guess that's what&nbsp;you call it).&nbsp; I was actually able to recreate the look the next day.&nbsp; I look fabulous!   I am thinking of starting my own business.&nbsp; I am going to learn to embroider.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can then monogram any of my merchandise.&nbsp; I wonder if there is a market for an embroiderer in Greece?

      How exciting my own special place.&nbsp; I feel like someone might be listening.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Have you ever been to Georgia.&nbsp; That is where I live.&nbsp; Well, that is where I currently live.&nbsp; I am originally from Virginia.&nbsp; Georgia is, well, different.&nbsp; I went to the optometrist today.&nbsp; It took three hours.&nbsp; So many things like that have happened to me since I moved here.&nbsp; I finally let my irritation show in the third hour.&nbsp; Then I felt horrible.&nbsp; Why do we feel so bad (or even afraid) when we tell someone we are not satisfied.&nbsp; We spend an enormous amount of money every year on the service industry.&nbsp; Yet customer service in our country has become so bad that we feel we should write a thank you letter to McDonald's if the drive-thru attendant says, "have a nice day."&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you ever feel like you have come in at the end of something?&nbsp; Like the 60's seem so cheesy, but people said things like thank you and men held doors open for ladies.&nbsp; People seemed more happy.&nbsp; And nice!&nbsp; What do I know, I was not alive then.&nbsp; I am just going on what I see in the movies.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ah, the movies!&nbsp; I love Hollywood.&nbsp; If my life were a movie I hope the leading man would be Brad Pitt. Or Sean Bean.&nbsp; Yes, I know they are very different.&nbsp; They are each beautiful in their own way.&nbsp; Brad is just beautiful.&nbsp; Sean is handsome and has an accent.&nbsp; In reality if my life were a movie&nbsp;the leading man would probably be Jack Black.&nbsp; Oh well, at  least  he is funny.  &nbsp;  Well, I have a hair appointment in the morning.&nbsp; Needless to say I will feel more Brad Pitt than Jack Black.&nbsp; Until the humidity brings me back to reality anyway.  &nbsp;  Note:&nbsp; I am not the best writer.&nbsp; I know I have terrible punctuation.&nbsp; Please do not give me a hard time as I am a work in progress.
