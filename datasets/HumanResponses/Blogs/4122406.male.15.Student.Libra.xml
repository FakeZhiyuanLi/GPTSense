						   Just realised that this has been going a week now! I didn't think I'd keep it up this long. Maybe it's because I'm away from school right now; I'm updating every day. Hopefully this will continue. Obviously, since I'm off for just over two weeks starting from Thursday, I won't be as regular. But hey, it's a good start!

						   As we are going on holiday on Saturday, to a remote location in Wales, we are going to need food. Other years we have gone food shopping the day before, and taken it all with us. Fortunately, with the wonderous internet, it will become much easier. This year, we are signing on to  urlLink Tesco.com  . For those who do not know, Tesco is a massive food supermarket chain. They offer, on their website, an 'online shop', where one can browse through items you want, add it to a cyber-trolley, and pay for them at an online checkout where you put in your credit card details. In the next few days, a Tesco van will pull up outside your house, and deliver these items  to your door. All you need to do is unpack! Well, it so happens that the cottage we are going to be staying in is in an area where Tesco will deliver. So on our arrival day, we should see a Tesco van sitting outside, with all our food needed for the next few days. You'd have never thought it'd happen!    urlLink Dawn Eden , who I met last week is back from her travels. Go check out her blog at  urlLink www.dawneden.com/blogger.html   Right, thats all from me. G'night.

						    urlLink The Last Alliance . This is the name of the site of which I am a member. This is its description of itself:   "The Last Alliance is an online resource centre and meeting point for players of Games Workshop's Lord of the Rings battle game. Run by gamers for gamers, it is our mission to make it easier than ever for the community to share their knowledge, experience and tips with other players. "   Yes, I play those 'Warhammer' games. Though technically,   urlLink Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game s  is nothing like Warhammer. The gameplay itself is based upon the Warhammer gameplay, but everything else is different. For those that have no idea of what I'm going on about, this is a brief overview. You buy little models, metal and plastic, about an inch high, paint them and then, using various rules, you battle with them.  I started playing it when a magazine called  urlLink Battle Games in Middle Earth  came out. This is the same models/game as the  urlLink GamesWorkshop  one, but just made it available to a wider area of the population.  I now have over 200 miniatures, and have spent around 200-250 pounds. Take a look at the various links to see what they are like.  When my site is done, I will have my own pictures on it.  This is just one that I have painted:   It is a facinating hobby, but one that is looked upon as geekish and pathetic by popular people. You get a whole lot of flak if you don't do what 'normal' people do, but you learn to live with it.

						   It's one of my sister's 21st birthday tomorrow, and as she is having a proper celebration with her friends some time in September, she just wanted to do something nice with the family today. So, after church, we drove all the way to  urlLink Easton Lodge Gardens . As we live in Luton, Easton Lodge Gardens (ELG) aren't that far away. But with the heat, and the long winding country roads, it seemed much longer.  Anyway, as our family quite often goes to visit old country homes, stately gardens etc, I wasn't to happy to be going. Luckily, ELG were very different from other gardens I've seen. It was, until quite recently, neglected, and had fallen into ruin - if gardens can do that.  So the gardens are quite wild and rugged, but have an inherent neatness. The day was really, really hot, but still nice. We had a picnic under a massive cedar tree with a long swing coming down. After that we just wandered through the gardens, and eventually settled down by a long glade. Thereupon most of the family lay down, and stayed in that position until it was time to go.  As we approached Luton, it started to rain.

						   Two quotes from Winston Churchill:    Lady Nancy Astor:    Winston, if you were my husband, I'd put arsenic in your morning coffee.       Churchill:    Madam, if you were my wife, I'd drink it.     and    Bessie Braddock:    Winston, you are drunk!       Churchill:    And Madam, you are ugly. And tomorrow, I'll be sober, and you will still be ugly.      urlLink Bessie Braddock  was a Liverpool MP during the Second World War.   It was hot again today. I just stayed inside most of the time and read  urlLink 'Sharpes Waterloo '. It's an excellent book, one of Bernard Cornwall's better Sharpe novels, I think. I'm also reading Geoffrey Ashe's 'Mythology of the British Isles' that I got yesterday. Facinating stuff.

						   Wow, what a day! Up at the crack of dawn - well, 7.00 - and to the Chiltern Hotel to get onto the coach. I was expecting a journey of about 2 1/2 hours, tops. Turns out it was about 4! Luckily, we had a toilet break at a place called  urlLink Lacock . This village is home to  urlLink Lacock Abbey , the location for parts of  urlLink 'Pride & Prejudice'  and the Harry Potter films.   urlLink     A rather bright view of the Abbey   urlLink     Part of Lacock Village itself   urlLink     Some historic building in Lacock! It just looked nice.  Then we eventually got to Galstonbury. After parking to coach, we made our way to The Shrine of Our Lady of Glastonbury.  urlLink     Upstairs in the Church hall, we had 'elevenses' at 12.30 (Somerset cream tea!), and met up with Geoffrey Ashe and his wife.  urlLink    The man is  urlLink Dale Ahlquist , President of the Chesterton Society in the US. He was the one who brought over all the Americans of the Chesterton Pilgrimage. The woman in white standing next to him is Geoffrey's wife.   urlLink     Geoffrey talking to the Monseigneur.   urlLink     Geoffrey talking in the Shrine.  After the talk, Geoffrey took us round the grounds of the Abbey at Glastonbury.  urlLink     This is the approach to the Abbey, with the tower coming over the roofs.   urlLink     Part of the remains of the Abbey - it was torn down with the dissolution of the monastaries in the Reformation.   urlLink    This is the archway seen in the last photo. One of the decorative arches - about the third one out from the middle - tells the story of the first few chapters from St. Matthews Gospel.   urlLink    Standing by King Arthur's alleged, but unmarked  grave .  urlLink    The actual ground. His body, found here under a lead cross was then exhumed by monks, and placed in a tomb by the High Altar.   urlLink    Part of Dale Ahlquist's family and Geoffrey Ashe plus wife.   urlLink     King Arthur's  tomb . The sign reads:  "In the Year 1101, the bodies of King Arthur and his Queen were said to have been found on the South Side of the Lady Chapel. On 10th April 1278, their remains were removed in the presence of King Edward I and Queen Eleanor to a black marble tomb on this site. This tomb survived until the dissolution of the Abbey in 1539."    urlLink     Another shot.   urlLink     Legend has it that Joseph of Arametheia planted his staff at Glastonbury, and it grew into a thorn bush. The strange thing about this thornbush, is that it is only native to the Holy Land. Geoffrey and his wife standing under it. This is not the orignal bush - the original is on a hilltop nearby.  After the tour of the Abbey, a group of us decided to walk up to the  urlLink Tor .  urlLink     This is it from the streets below. We had about an hour to climb it and get back to the coach, so we walked as fast as we could. The hill is over 500ft tall, but the climb was worth it, as the views were amazing.   urlLink    By this time, I only had one small photo left, so I took a picture of one of the stunning views. We could see for miles! We raced back down into Glastonbury, and just before we got onto the coach to go back home, I raced into the bookshop, and bought Geoffrey Ashe's book  urlLink 'Mythology of the British Isles' . I then raced back outside, went over to him, and got it signed! The message inside reads "Best wishes Geoffrey Ashe Aug/04". Heh.  He hasn't seen the film of King Arthur yet, so I couldn't ask him about it.  The journey home wasn't too bad, but again, I'm really tired. Luckily the weather held out!

						   The weather today was mixed. For the most part, it was very dry; almost humid. Apparently there was meant to be another thunderstorm today, but all we saw of that was some sporadic rain, and even that was only a little.  Anyway, enough of the weather. Go see  urlLink 'King Arthur' ! Went to see it today, and I promise you, you wont be disappointed. Forget what the critics say, unless they say good things about it of course. Apart from the occasional below-par acting (the young Lancelot for instance), it was a gripping film. Moving, even, in some parts. It's not comparable with either  urlLink 'Lord of the Rings' , or  urlLink 'Troy' , because of the completely different situations, but it was as good as them. It portrayed almost-post-Roman Britain very well, and there were some fantastic scenery shots. Just go see it!  I am in Glastonbury tomorrow. No, not for the music festival, that finished ages ago, but to listen to  urlLink Geoffrey Ashe  speak. In fact, I will be doing much more. I am going with a group of Americans to visit the  urlLink Marian Shrine of Our Lady of Glastonbury . Then there will be a talk by Geoffrey Ashe, one of the world's greatest authorities on King Arthur and Arthurian legend. After a 'light picnic', there will be a tour of  urlLink Glastonbury Abbey  with Geoffrey. I will return in the evening. It will be interesting to see what, if indeed he does, Geoffrey Ashe says about the film 'King Arthur', and whether it is a 'true' portrayal or not.

						   Our town council has decided that our street was too dirty. So last week they sent letters out to every household explaining what was going to be happening. As they were going to be clearing the drains as well, we were asked to move all the cars off the street. So I woke up this morning to see a street completely empty of cars - a sight which probably hasn't been seen since 1930's maybe. Anyway, they're done now, but I don't see any difference. I havn't actually been down to the street yet, so there may be some things I didn't see. It will be interesting to see how long the street takes to become dirty again.

						   English weather is cruel. This is a known fact. The day before yesterday was as lovely weather as you could hope for; bright blue skies, a warm wind etcetc. Now yesterday was a completely different matter - such torrential rain that to stand underneath it was like being pummelled with, uhm, things that pummell you. I was walking back from the library, and as I had no money to phone home, nor a mobile, I had to run through the town wearing my jeans and a t-shirt. By the time I had got home, I was saturated. Absolutely soaking. Today, of course, to stop us English from getting too comfortable with the weather, it has decided to revert to it's sunny state, and is looking very pleasant. No doubt tomorrow it will start snowing, or some such equally silly weather for the beginning of August.   I will be going to see  urlLink 'King Arthur'  tomorrow. Apparently it's not that good, but since I've seen Lord of the Rings, and Troy, I want to see the next sword-y film. More on that when I come back.  Saw  urlLink Minority Report  again yesterday at my girlfriend's house. Slightly unnerving film, as it is set pretty close in the future.
