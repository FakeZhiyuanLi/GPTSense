      hi. i'm back. another week past. so, all the excitement and flurry of attention of last week has officially worn off... and i'm most definitely moody these days! sometimes i have my head in the clouds, daydreaming, others i'm crashing back to earth reality. i think i've become a thrill-seeking addict and now that the level of excitement has worn of, i find i need more!! oh-uh... single, new york girl needs emotional rush treatment... maybe i should meditate a little and try yoga instead... or take up knitting or something like that.  kids, until next time....

      return of the haze... hi there: i'm back and starting a part two of my crazy adventure in new york city living. welcome to my sometimes helpless story of a savvy 20-something female living it up and occasionally down, in the city that never lets her sleep... so here's the latest update: the last time i left off, i was moving past the ex-boy, searching for someone new, sizing up a cute prospect  in sf, and then trying to figure out how to archive these postings. some, but not all of my missions were accomplished - like this whole archiving bit, i still can't figure it out. but i'm back with even more gossip, more adventures, and more late-night realizations - so stay tuned as i will have much, much, more to come. that's a promise... i hope. love ya!

       psychics, stars, and the holidays...  hiya gang! i didn't think i had much to report on, but as i was starting to daze off at work, i  just remembered a couple of "strange" occurences of the past month. to start off, i'm on a date one saturday night in nov. and am having a pretty miserable time-can't blame my date entirely, it wasn't his fault - yet  out of nowhere, i see a shooting star dart across the manhattan skyline, which for a moment gave me an unsurmountable sense of hope and a profound moment of relief ;)  as for psychics, i've been told i would travel soon (a tropical island) and that possibly love is coming into my life!! woohooo! well, wait a minute, who wouldn't want that sort of a future....  hmmm....  ahh, yeah,  so the holidays are fast approaching us... we celebrated thanksgiving at the apt., instead of traditional turkey, we had gourmet salmon and potatoes, asparagus and ice cream. wine and more wine. heartburn and headaches. ahhh, loser thanksgiving to the fullest! these are the days, aren't they? so there you have it. the current juice of the month! and if these psychics are onto something, and falling stars do hold symbolic meanings, well i'll be sure to win the lottery, too! haha.    uhhh, gang, i wouldn't hold my breath, if i were you ... talk to you soon! cheers ;)

      Hellooo. I thought I'd just take a peek and say hi today.  Nothing too exciting is on the gossip radar, except the usual: mr. ex and I are supposing to hang out- (yeah, yeah old news) - and at the last minute some kind of intervention keeps us from coming together. again.  Oh well.  It's spring and I need a new cutie ...   Oh yeah!   I almost forgot to add that I'm going to miss vegging out on Tues nights, watching ANTM, while stuffing my face guilt-free and skinny girls starve themselves on t.v. ... ahh, the joys of not caring about perfection these days ... ;)

      I went to see my accountant yesterday. She's such a doll.   After meeting with the accountant, I was starved. So, i went into a restaurant for a quick bite in the neighborhood.  I haven't dined alone, in a long time, but at that exact moment I didn't really care. I'm sitting by myself, the waiters are being too kind in an almost I'm so sorry you don't have any friends to eat lunch with kinda way. Then, they seat this adorably cute skater looking boy at my table. His sandy blond light hair peeked from under his navy knit cap and his icy blue eyes felt like lasers beaming directly at me. And we ate, he in his casual, messy jeans, wrinkled t-shirt outfit, reading the Economist (!!)  and me, suited up trying to look semi-professional, reading a fluffy, light-hearted paperback by M. Keyes.  Well it's good thing I left "How to Seduce Your Man in 10 Minutes" at home.  We couldn't have been better matched for a lunch date. There must be an angel looking out for me.  So, almost everything on my list below can be checked off now, except joining the gym and planning the 401k. Why is it that the things that are good for you - just aren't good for you fun-wise?  My sage advice for day: be prepared for an impromptu lunch date  and be sure to order wine with the meal. just in case. ;)

        Old thoughts         If we all have a true love, there's a good chance I&nbsp;already met mine. He came into my life, and transformed my world into a rosy-colored vision of a fairytale existence.   He was the dream come true, the wish from faraway... everything I've ever wanted or could ever ask for in a person, that was him. We read each other's thoughts and emotions, felt one another's pain and sadness. Almost as if we had a special link to the other. As of now, circumstances are keeping us apart. Despite that, the agreement we made, a pact that was held, we would love even if we lose.   He will always be part of my  "New York" . And, if destiny has its way, who knows, maybe someday I will&nbsp;see him&nbsp;again. Someday maybe.    (to B... in Norway)

       Continued Tue Apr 27     Just Like Heaven      'Show me how you do that trick  The one that makes me scream' she said  'The one that makes me laugh' she said  And threw her arms around my neck     'Show me how you do it  And I promise you I promise that  I'll run away with you  I'll run away with you'   Spinning on that dizzy edge  I kissed her face and kissed her head  And dreamed of all the different ways I had  To make her glow  'Why are you so far away?' she said  'Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you  That I'm in love with you'   You  Soft and only  You  Lost and lonely  You  Strange as angels  Dancing in the deepest oceans  Twisting in the water  You're just like a dream   Daylight licked me into shape  I must have been asleep for days  And moving lips to breathe her name  I opened up my eyes  And found myself alone alone  Alone above a raging sea  That stole the only girl I loved  And drowned her deep inside of me   You  Soft and only  You  Lost and lonely  You  Just like heaven      by the cure

       True Confessions    Maybe a week or so ago, (who knows with daylight savings time and all), Mr. Ex sends me an email.   And we're going back and forth, pretty tame I must add, as I  am  working. But, he sends a final thought "Come out for drinks with me  tonight  ..."   And I wanted to, but then I ... didn't.   So, every call that I got, I dodged. Left my cell-phone off, for the slight chance that I may be tempted to (ahem) pick up his call.   Then with one final try of the night, Mr. Ex leaves me a voice message. Such a sweet, sweet endearing message I couldn't delete for days after - oh how typical Mr. Ex.   Let me explain here. Mr. Ex is a smooth, seductive, charming sort of guy that you just know when you meet him, you should probably turn around and keep on walking. But you just can't. Not with types like Mr. Ex. They're like magnets pulling you into trouble, albeit lots of fun trouble.   So, as you see, hiding out is a pretty good survival tool for a gal like me.   But, is this it? Could that be? Hmmm... I don't know. Although I wouldn't be suprised if we had another run in. But then again maybe I would!!   Have a good week and be safe dear readers :)

      Oh Blog,  I missed you soo much! You're like a bad habit I can't quit. I've been away for a while making-up, making out for lost time.    Love, love, love    Check it out -   R.   (Love-of-M-Life # 1)  emailed me! Holy Shitz! (In his words, of course) We haven't spoken in like Six - Seven years. And I realized,     love is love     no matter how long nor far away. Damn, he still takes my breath away, just like he did when we met underage drinking too many years ago.  What next... He's my old-time love/crush/obsession... But now there is a current sweetie who is just  sooooo  adorable and  nice . (Yes, I like nice guys now Thank you very much).  But he won't ask me out! Come on, already.  And I still don't know how to work up the nerves to get him out either. What to do? I've got a dilemma on my hands.  Please advise. Tusen Takk

      Why is it the more low-life you become, the nicer people get? All these years I must have had it backwards. Be kind to everyone and the world is kind to you. But that's not always so.  However, lately, I'm finding the total opposite happen... be shi**ty all the time and people suddenly are super sweet to you.  Strange logic and I don't recommend it, but it works sometimes...

       Sorry, but I promise this will be my only indulgent post today about the Hot Boy in the Office, aka "The Crush".   He wrote me a sweet letter and left it for me this morning. Not an email, voicemail, post-it, fax, etc... all that crazy, modern-office stuff that keeps you safely away from any human contact during the day.  Nope.  Just a cute hand-written letter on company stationary.  He really IS that   lovely!

      The crush is back... But, I can't focus on him today for some odd reason. Maybe because I know he's leaving soon, Or that he's right behind me at this very moment... Any look over my shoulder and I'm busted; Just like that.  So anyways, I've done nothing but bit*h and complain all summer about my co-workers. One in particular has been driving me nuts... (Not in the good way, either).... But yesterday, I came into the office and he bought me two dozen red roses and left them on my desk.  I felt like such an evil person. A monster. A tool.  Today, I've resolved to turn over a new leaf and send kind thoughts to everyone. Especially to mr. rose-boy, my new friend.  p.s. Starting to wonder if "The Crush" is seeing someone at work? Hmmmm... will have to keep you posted...

       He is in today, but he's about to leave again and catch a flight out ... oh the pining, the wishing and crushing, is just way too much to handle... To be soo close, yet so faraway.  Hmmm, he is rather beautiful to look at though.
