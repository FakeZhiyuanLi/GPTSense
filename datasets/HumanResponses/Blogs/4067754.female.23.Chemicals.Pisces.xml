						   since i start every entry with a list...  accomplishments: 1.  i ate a muffaletta today which contained, i later found, 101% of my daily sodium intake. 2.  my eyes have been burning for over 3 days. 3.  in the last two weeks, i have contacted unresolved friends i never thought i would see again.  so my week is now over.  it's monday.   my weekend began, this afternoon at about 2pm, when i got to lay down and take a nap, not because i had to get to sleep, but because i could, and wanted to.  this is important because for the last four days, i have been a slave to work, general plans, pre-planned events, and a host of people.  my plans included going to bed friday later than i meant to, then working an opening shift last saturday, then going to see an all-afternoon concert in blinding heat and surviving a generally painful but entertaining event.  the show was a dance-around-feel-good-event despite The Cure being known as dismal and depressive.  the ampitheater was completely packed out.  we hopped seats and got up close.   the whole event was impressive and brightly lit.  which actually brings me to the painful part.  i had been up at 5am, so my eyes were burning.  i dont think i can convey how annoyed i was when my eyes began to burn and tear up for nearly the whole last 3 hours of the show because of the fog machines and the strobes.  there i was, in the middle of the cure, wearing sunglasses to avoid the lights coming at me from stage.   my most perfect moment was when i was sitting in the darkening ampitheater, eating a fistful of turkey leg i had purchased as my only meal for $6, while listening to Interpol play a set of music.  it was a moment of equilibrium.  anyway.  sunday i went to work a muleshift of 8.5 hours only to go to sleep right after work and get up less than 6 hours later to open again.  a complete glitch in the system left me starved for true rest and then set me up to have the next four days off.  so now, i nap.  and hopefully get to the ever-present list of tasks which will fill my week.  here i come!

						   1.  figuring out how to change the shutter speed on my new digital camera and make pictures b&w. 2.  wearing whitney's new pants and sexy underware and strutting around runway-model style. 3.  reading my newest good book, Valencia by michelle tea in bed before going to sleep. 4.  finally taking the humidifier out of the p o t and finding out once and for all, if it's musty and wet. 5.  cuddling with my cat until she claustrophobically scratches one of my eyes out. 6.  remembering all of the good websites i keep meaning to go to. 7.  figuring out whether john kerry is in favor of repealing massatuchesteses' gay marriage law.  *does anyone else have a list of untra-fun things they want to be doing and can't make up their minds?

						   today i declare it, 'appreciate the small things' day.  to start this blogspot off right, i will first take the chance to list off a few things that have put me in a good mood today.  high speed internet. easily de-mildewing a bathtub by spraying bleach and walking away. sweeping and swiffering a floor. simple chocolate brown furniture. army shorts and red converse shoes. high protein/high iron/no salt/no sugar/no carb recipes that actually taste good. feeling productive. actually being productive. getting a chance to assist a professional photographer for the first time. finally feeling like your goals are being accomplished.  amen? free coffee.  sometimes i feel so lucky.
