      QUEERLY BELOVED 'Married' homosexuals already seek divorce Awaiting Supreme Court decision on validity of licenses  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted: July 13, 2004 1:00 a.m. Eastern    Â© 2004 WorldNetDaily.com   A homosexual couple that was issued a "marriage license" by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom in February is now seeking a "divorce."   The couple, which has not been identified for privacy reasons, is waiting on the California Supreme Court to decide whether the 3,955 licenses obtained at San Francisco's City Hall during a 29-day period are valid.  As WorldNetDaily reported, Newsom oversaw the first officially sanctioned same-sex marriages in American history Feb. 12.   If the high court voids the licenses, no further action will be taken, the San Jose Mercury News reported.   The paper notes the breakup has political repercussions since it's the first to surface since homosexual activists argued for the stability and social value of same-sex relationships after San Francisco began issuing the licenses.   "It's not surprising that these unnatural arrangements don't last," said Randy Thomasson, executive director of the Campaign for California Families, the group that sued San Francisco to block the licenses. "Despite popular belief, the real goal of homosexual relationships isn't commitment, it's self-gratification and sexual pleasure."   But homosexual-rights activists insist conclusions should not be drawn since thousands of other same-sex marriages remain intact.   "As a political development, this is not a helpful thing," Thom Lynch, executive director of the San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community Center, said, according to the Mercury News. "But why should we be held to a higher standard than straight couples?"   Mat Staver, president and chief counsel of Liberty Counsel, a public interest group that argued the case, cites leading homosexual activist Michelangelo Signorile to argue "homosexual relationships are notoriously short-lived."   Signorile, Staver points out, has said male homosexual relationships of any duration typically have a "nonmonogamous agreement."   Signorile says "the term 'open relationship' has for a great many gay men come to have one specific definition: a relationship in which the partners have sex on the outside often, put away their resentment and jealousy and discuss their outside sex with each other, or share sex partners."   Staver notes Signorile also states he and others like him want same-sex marriage in order to "redefine the institution of marriage completely, to demand the right to marry not as a way of adhering to society's moral codes but rather to debunk a myth and radically alter an archaic institution."   The homosexual activist further says same-sex marriage provides "a chance to wholly transform the definition of family in American culture."   Staver contends the U.S. has "come to a point in history where it is no longer acceptable to merely state that one is in favor of traditional marriage."   "Our senators and representatives must draw a line in the sand and preserve marriage once and for all by amending our federal Constitution," he said. "Our children and the future of America depend upon the actions that we take today on this important issue."     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      When will everyone realize?  GAY MARRIAGE IS WRONG!  Marriage has been around for  thousands  of years and it has been strictly a heterosexual thing.  These stupid activist judges think that by forcing us to recognise the marriage between a man and a man or woman and a woman will force us to accept thier not normal behavior.  I tolerate homosexuality because this is a free country, but i don't have to accept it because a few people tell me i should.  They (the homosexuals) don't accept that my religion tells me there lifestyle is wrong, so what makes this any different?  I don't care what you do begind closed doors, but when you bring it out in to the open and try to steal something that is sacred to me so you can defecate on it, that really makes me mad.  Its not even like most of the country wants to let the gays marry, they oppose it! Bring it on.  anyone willing to battle me on this one can im me or email me at any time.  Its in my profile.  UGHHHHHHH! thats all for now. -gRANT
