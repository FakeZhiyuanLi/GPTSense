         Why women's beach volleyball is suddenly popular, why we should be mad at the NBA, and a few choice words for NBC...    I've not ashamed to admit it, I 've got Olympic fever .  It's a pleasant break from the big three sports (baseball, football, and basketball) that monopolize televised sports coverage for the other 206 weeks every four years.   The great thing about the Olympics is not the pageantry, it's not the athleticism, it's not even the bikini-clad women's beach volleyball players (more on that in a minute).  The greatest thing about the Olympics is that it gives everyone a chance to watch a sport they've never seen before and say to themselves, "I don't see what's so hard about that.  Heck,  with a little practice I could compete  in [water polo, trampoline, or whatever]"  Your average American knows that he'll never be able to pitch like Pedro Martinez, and he'll never have a chance to take it to the hoop  a la  Jordan.  It was a sad day for me when I realized that  I would probably never be able to start as runningback for the Chicago Bears  (although the way they've been playing the last few years, you never know.  Lovie...call me!)   But bouncing on a trampoline?  Whirling around in the hammer throw?  That doesn't look too hard, right? Maybe the dream of being a world-class athlete is attainable after all.  Maybe we just weren't looking at the right sport.  Obviously, the athletes who compete in the Olympics know better.   And  they should be proud of themselves for making it look so easy .  Two athletes who make it look very easy are  Kerri Walsh and Misty May , one of two teams representing the US in Olympic beach volleyball.  After beating Canada tonight in the quarterfinals, Kerri and Misty (I allow myself the familiarity, since I've been a fan for at least the last week) are going to face the  other  US team in the semis tomorrow.   Probably the biggest disappointment to come out of the Olympics so far is the debacle that has been the US men's basketball team.  You've heard the story by now, no doubt.  None of our high-profile NBA stars would step up and play (except for Iverson and Duncan, of course), leaving the US team in the lurch.   I think there's more to it than that.  The fact is,  the world has caught up to us in basketball .  Lithuania, Argentina, even Puerto Rico have world class teams now.   But the fact that our NBA "stars" had something better to do than represent the US in Athens should irk you.   Finally, has NBC dropped the ball on Olympic coverage?  I tend to think so.  Although the big time difference is a hurdle to providing live coverage, NBC is focusing too much on highlights, and not enough on showing entire events.  Come on, guys,  with five networks  (NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, USA, and Bravo) under your corporate banner, couldn't you devote a little more time to the culmination of sporting excellence, and a little less time to the dyspeptic ramblings of Dennis Miller?

         Let's start this blog off with the conventional crappy introductory post...    While I'm more than aware that  the concept of blogging is still foreign to at least 75% of Americans , the face of blogging and bloggers has changed significantly in the last year or so.  The stereotypical blogger is no longer synonomous with the stereotypical computer nerd, eating Cheetos in his parent's basement.  But one thing that unites bloggers is the fact that  we are all shameless media and information junkies .  So what's all this then?  It's the Media Jones.  I'm not going to pretend that I'm going to round up all the news stories the mainstream outlets miss, or anything like that.  Media is information, commentary is information, and by that logic, this is information.
