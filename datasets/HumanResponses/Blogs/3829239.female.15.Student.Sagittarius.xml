      jeanette and me hosed (is that how you spell that?) eachother down today. it was great, well it was like a thousand degrees out, so it was all good. we started washing my bros jeep and then my parents explorer, just for kix. eew, we cleaned out the birdbath, fungus up the ass, i swear. but anyway, i came to a realization today...i am obsessed with guys. if you are a guy and you are reading this, i want you to know that the humans of your sex are always on my mind. hmmmm, its okay tho, cuz its great. i love guys. whoa whoa whoa, there was a rumble with robert and me last night, we kinda went all off on eachother, well i kinda went off more than he did. but the sad thing is that i had forgot all about robert this summer, other things completely over crowded my mind, i had forgot that i had asked him out, and i had forgot that i had been rejected. now thats bad. i mean, i know i have a bad memory, but Jesus, how do i forget that i was all sad about it. but anyway, i wasnt sad for long, cuz along came elias, and we hung out with adan, and jumped in the river, and hey, well if youre reading this adan, i want you to kno, your friends are so hot. man its great being single.

      ummmm 4th of july was so boring, i did absolutely nothing, its like the one day i should do something this summer. celebrate the great day of independence, i dont do anything. i mean i did nothing, i sat on my freakin couch all day and ate. oh but michael tamez called me!!! an old ex boyfriend, i was with him like 2 years ago, and i hadnt talked to him in over a year. it was really nice talking to him again. o yea, so anyway, isnt independence day actually on the 6th, or the 8th or something. whats up with celebrating it on the 4th? thats so whack. well today i went to 6flags, turtles sexy ass called me at 11, woke me up and asked me to go. jeanette was supposed to go with us, but her mom cancelled last minute. "i never said you could go!" damn, that sucked for her. so anyway, my day with turtle was great! this guy tagged along with us.... his name was chris, he was from michigan, he was gay, he liked turtle, he was wearing green, he reminded me of nicholas, he was 17, he was smart? anyway, enought about chris. wow. i had the guts. i grew today. yea right, just kidding. i called justin. yea, umm I called justin. he didnt answer, but he called back. we only talked for like not even 2 minutes, but we didnt really talk, it was more like i talked. ugh i hate when that happens. whats the point of being on the phone if only one person is talking, doesnt that defeat the whole purpose of it being a conversation?!? well i told him i saw stacy the other day....he obviously had already heard from robert, cuz kelley called me later asking if stacey was doing anything with the damn guy cuz justin wanted to know. geeze, does this girl live for gossip? what the fuck!? i hate this. thats it im gonna stop this for today, i want to get back to the life i wish i had.     "im never in my waking life, dreaming is my all the time"

"excuse me, do you have a dollar you can spare, i need money to take a taxi home" lol i made two bucks in like 5 minutes, but then i couldnt get anyone to give me any money. i got michael to go ask for money with me while leo and vito waited at hooters. we asked for "change for a phone call." some guy told me that i could use his cell phone, so i called my room number and pretended to tell my mom to pick me up lol. after like half an hour we got our 5 bucks.

      Jeanette's mom took us to pick up Alek and then dropped us off at Sam's. It was super early, like 6 or so, so we walked our butts to the park. We had fun there got on the swings and climbed a tree. At Sam's we ran into Michael and Seantell from school, they know eachother from church and I never knew!!!! Yep. Well Alek danced a little bit.... Kevin Goes to College, the Stingers, and 33 West played. We didn't see 33 West, but I heard they sucked. So whatever. Anyway, Alek was great.

      My mamma and I picked up Alek from his house....and then Jeanette. We came back to my house and hung out for a while. Awe!!! I was cuddling with Alek in my bed. We didn't do anything, hmm, well I combed his hair and gave him a kiss on his cheek, and he gave me a kiss on my cheek too. We had a pillow fight too!!! It was the greatest. He kept looking at me while we were "sleeping" and getting my hands out of my face, and he would hesitate on whether to hold them or not, and I finally asked why he was scared to hold my hand, so he did...awe. So that's how our cuddling got started. Anyway, we left to Sam's and we saw Justin, Robert, Rob, and Jeff play. They did good... there was lots of people there from school. Anyway, I had fun with Alek and Jeanette. We held hands on our way home....

      I got up and talked to Alek for a while, then took a shower and hung out around the house doing nothing. I got dressed and stuff and my mom picked up Jeanette, and then me and then dropped us off at the Natatorium. I saw Alek in spandex! ha. Well we didn't stay there too long, but I still got to see Alek, awe. Eww some mojo hardcore offended Jeanette when he drove by us and, well, I'd rather not say. Anyhoo, we got Frito Pies that sucked ass from the ice cream lady, and since I didn't like it, Alek finished it for me. We all left, and my mom, Jeanette, and I went to South Park to pay some bills, where I ended up getting two pairs of jeans from Pac Sun. We dropped Jeanette off at home, then came home. Alek had left me a message on my answering machine so I talked to him until 11 or so. We're trying to get our sleeping schedules fixed before going back to school. It's obviously not working for me! Yesterday Tate i.med me to make sure "things were cool" between us. I'm like, yeah whatever dude. Anyway I'm going to their show tomorrow, "Given a Chance." That means I'm gonna have to see Justin, Jeff, Rob and Rob....

      I went to H.E.B with my mamma and got groceries. I bought cake mix so that Jeanette and I could make a cake later for Megan. So Jeanette came over and we made her sisters cake, and then watched Summerland. Jeanette left like at 10 or 11, and then of course I just stayed on the phone with Alek for a while. Is this guy gonna ever ask me out?

      This is gonna be straightforward and to the point.   I went to Jeanette's house, called Mark for our shit. Didn't get our shit. Jeanette got bitched at by her mother. Picked up Rachel, drove half way to Floresville, picked up Melinda. Went to Hemisfair, waited for David and Thomas, they got there. Got wet in the water fountain. Smoked cigs with Jeanette. David and Rachel made out. Adan and Elias finally arrive. We walk to the river. Don't talk to Adan or Elias. Hang out by the river. Rachel and David made out. Everyone jumps in the river except for Elias, Jeanette and me. Then Elias goes in. Elias throws a duck egg at me and Jeanette, misses me by an inch. I throw Adan's new beanie in the river, Melinda's bracelet accidently swings off my wrist. I yell at people, people yell at me. Jeanette and me hang out with a dog at a pit stop we make on our way back to Hemisfair, everyone else goes ahead of us. Jeanette and me go to McDonald's and buy soda, then go to Hemisfair. We play hide and go seek with Melinda and Thomas. David and Rachel make out. Melinda and Thomas stay hiding in their "house" for the rest of the time, and have a moment later. David and Rachel made out. I swing, Jeanette swings. We sit on a bench, Jeanette leaves me to go talk to Adan after I just bitch at David, Rachel, Adan, and Elias. I almost fall asleep on a bench. Mark calls and says he still doesn't have our shit. We leave. Drop off Rachel at her house. Melinda and Jeanette stay here for a while. They make food, Melinda leaves. Jeanette and me watch Head of State and then Ice Age. I talked to Alek for the rest of the night.

      I went to Abigail's dance recital today! It was so cute!!!! She started crying while she was on the stage, but frankly I don't know why. And then a little girls pants fell off, it was so funny, but sad, for her. OMG! My mom drove on the highway today.....miracle! I couldn't believe it, I was like, "Mom, you're hardcore!" Ha, just kidding, but it was cool that she overcame her fear. After the recital Tia Lilia, Tia Meche, Grandma, my Mom and me went and ate at Tacos Los Valles. When I came home I had a message from Alek saying that he was back...so I called him. I talked to him, Jeanette, and Roy today, and that's it. Well Jeanette's friend Mark too, which lives across the street from her, but that was just to score some stuff :P.

      Well, well, well. Jeanette didn't even end up spending the night, her mom picked her up at like 1 in the morning all mad at her or something. But Melinda was here still. She talked to Michael forever and three days on the phone as I did with Alek, until his phone died out. Anyway, we crashed out at about 4 or so and then woke up at like 1. She called her mom to pick her up or whatever, so she left, and then I took a shower and went shopping with my mamma. I got two pairs of pants for school, some school shirts, and a jacket, which I thought was pretty cute. I didn't do anything when I got home. I've been so tired lately! I really just did not have  energy to do anything at all. Hmmm. Oh yeah, I saw Sena walking downtown, and that guy that's always all on his girlfriend at school, I don't know his name, but I know he's one of Jonathan's friends. So I was like, geeze, is it just the day to see people that Jonathan knows? Things like this happen to remind of schoo, and then of course that reminds me that school is going to suck. Eeww, school is going to suck! I have to go back sometime next week to get the hell out of the Media magnet programs bull. It takes up two classes! TWO CLASSES! That's so stupid, I have other classes I need to get out of my way, so I'm gonna be taking P.E. this year, and hopefully Spanish and Theatre Arts so I get those credits or whatever. But enough about school. Hmmm.....I haven't talked to Alek today, cuz he's in Austin? I think, or so he said he was going to be. But he could always be lying. Not that I think he would do that, but there's people that do that, "I'm gonna be out of town tomorrow, but I don't know when I'll be back, so I'll just give you a call," or well at least I know I do that. I hope I'm not the only bitch out there that does it. I just got through checking my mail a little while ago, and Adan wrote an apology email, though I can't write back, because I need to keep him out of my life. I guess it's more of a thing of pride. It's the whole, "I'm not gonna call him, if he wants to talk to me he can call," thing. Well shit, I'm tired of typing, so I'll check back in later. Oh shit, I remember his name!!! His name is Ricardo, or at least I think it is.....Oh! And I saw Stephanie Hernandez at the mall too.

      Alright, Camille and Jeanette came over last night and spent the night. We didn't crash out until like 6 in the morning, and then we woke up at 7:30 when Riane showed up. We got ready to leave, and by 8:45 we were out of here. I asked my mom to take me to Diamond Shamrock, and I bought two packs of Pop Rocks for Alek, since I knew that was his favorite candy. We went to Starbucks....Jeanette and Camille got Java Chip fraps, and I got a Vanilla Latte frap. Riane didn't get anything, because she didn't have money, but even so, she isn't allowed to drink coffee!!! Wow. I would die! Well off to school we were to register... I saw Alek pretty soon, I spotted him out from a mile away. Well I went to him and gave him his hat back, and I gave him the Pop Rocks, which he seemed to think was nice. I was wearing my "glasses," because he had asked me to, but I didn't wear my prescribed ones, I wore my fantasy ones, it was funny when I told him that they weren't my actual glasses....he was like "what!?!?!" Anyway, we hung out for a while, then decided we didn't wanna be at school for so long, so we left the school at like 10 and went to the river where I sat on the bridge, and then hung out with Alek. Jeanette was with us too, but she was off in her own world. It was nice sitting by the river and enjoying the day for a while, but then we headed back to school. We got back at around 12 or so. Hmm...well for all of this, Riane had taken this pretty white ribbon to school with her to play with. I use, or should I say used, this ribbon for my hair, but Stephanie killed it. It ripped, and I didn't find out about this till way later in the day. Anyway, she was also eating the Pop Rocks that I had bought Alek...what the fuck!? Oh well. Anyway, I got the whole registration process over with, and then we finally left at like 5 because my mom took forever to pick us up. But........before we left, I cannot forget to put this in here, Jeanette and me saw Roy's pube hairs! Man, it was hilarious, we were talking about something about his body, and he was like well look at my lil v line thingy, and he pushed his pants and boxers down to show us, but he kinda pushed them down too far, lol. Awwe, he was all embarrased, but it was just cute :P Well we all came back to my house and then Jeanette and my mom and me went and picked up Jamie (Jeanette's sister) and dropped her off at work. OMG! There was this lady frozen on the street laying down with her arms and legs in the air, it was horrbile, there was a crowd of people around her, and then we noticed there was a fire truck on it's way to the scene. I had no idea what the hell that was all about, but I just know that it was traumatizing seeing this lady there, it was so horrible!!! Well then we came back to my house to pick up the girls, and we all went to Taco Cabana, but not before stopping by Stephanie's house to pick up Melinda's glasses because her contact lens had torn while she was at my house. So we ate at Taco Cabana, and then went to Mccreless. I bought a skirt for school and Camille and me played Duck Hunt at this little booth where they had this video game thing plugged in. It was pretty fun! So after a while of hanging out tat the ghetto ass mall, we came back to my house. Camille got picked up just as we were about to leave to drop off Riane at her house. So right now I'm just bloggin, (duh) and Jeanette and Melinda are here and they are fingerpainting/painting .

      I hit Jeanette today. It was horrible. I feel like shit, and I am so sorry. I slapped her arm and left my hand marked on her skin. Today Jeanette was talking to Adan and she overheard him telling David about how he was confused about whether he should still talk to us or if he should drop us, as if we were objects. That pissed me off, and Jeanette too, so right now she is on the phone with him telling him shit. Camille is here, and she was confused when Jeanette told me that ever since the Adan situation happened she can't trust me anymore. She said it's one of the most horrible feelings in the world, and to me it felt like shit hearing her say that. Adan kissing me at the movies, and me kissing back is at the top of my list of the most stupid things that I've done. I'm not stupid, and I've noticed that ever since Jeanette found out about that day she's acted different towards me. It seems as if she is holding back anger, and she's rude to me. That's the whole reason I slapped her, I didn't mean to slap her hard, it's just that she was being rude, and I was tired of her being rude to me...it's how she's been for a while. I had already told her that there was something wrong with her lately, but I was trying to just shake it off I guess. Well I can in a way understand that it bothered her that we kissed, but it's not like she's with him. She was with him for a day....and then it's not my fault that he was so hurt that I dumped him after we had only been seeing eachother for two weeks. It was two weeks! That's all.....it hardly even counts as a relationship, actually to me it doesn't at all, let alone   one   day.

        Jeanette came over yesterday, we completed the scrapbook! Wow, it was jam packed, and we couldn't fit anything else in it, which is partly why we finished. We had lots more to fill it up with, but oh well. Well Camille stopped by later and spent the night here. I dyed her hair, and then straightened it while watching Nightmare Before Christmas for the first time believe it or not! Okay, the movie isn't even all that great, why does everyone make such a big deal out of it? Anyway, today we went to Six Flags, it was Jeanette, Camille, Alek, and me. Boy, oh boy, Alek has a nice bod. We saw a bunch of Adan's friends there......including Elias. His hair looked nice. They were on the train when we saw them, and I think only Eric noticed us, but I don't really care. Aww, it was so cute Alek and me sat on this boulder type thing and watched fireworks during the Lone Star Spectacular, or whatever it's called, anyway, yea it was cute. Jeanette told me afterwards, "I just want you to know that that was one of the best experiences I've ever had, just watching you two sitting on the rock, and then you pushing him off was cool," or something along those lines..........real nice. On the way to drop off Alek back home we were dancing and singing in the car, which was fun, though it didn't last very long.... Then I took his hat, and he told me to hold it for him until Friday when I see him at registration, and he asked me to wash it, what's up with that? ha. Well I'm hungry, so I'm outta here, catch ya on the flip flop.
