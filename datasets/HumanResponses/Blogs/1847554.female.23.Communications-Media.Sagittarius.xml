      (note:  This was originally published on my old website  urlLink "Weezer and Stuff" )  Scott's Side Project  a fanfic by Becca       "Brian has a side project.  Pat has a side project.  Why can't I have a side project? It's not fair!," Scott said to himself, thinking about how Rivers was about side projects.  He remembered times where Brian would talk about the Space Twins and then get yelled at by Rivers.  Pat knew enough not to talk about it very much in the first place.       Weezer was taking a break for a while.  Pat was doing stuff with The Special Goodness.  Brian was doing stuff with the Space Twins.  Rivers was busy hanging out with Fred, Britney, and other celebrities so people would see him on TV or at least inside a tabloid.  Scott was bored out of his mind.  True, cruising around Silverlake in his El Camino was fun, but he missed playing his bass.       Just then there was a knock at the door of Scott's apartment.  It was Brian.  "Hey, Scott!  How are you doing today?," he asked gleefully.       "Hmmm... bored... but fine... I guess...," Scott replied.       "Well I came over to invite you to a performance of my band, the Space Twins.  Would you like to come?  We will be playing tonight at the Troubador," Brian said eloquently.       "Sure.  Why not?," Scott said, even though it was just another reminder of what he could be doing.       Later that night, Scott observed Brian's performance in a hidden away spot in the bar, away from the screaming girls who were always trying to pet Brian.  He was hoping they wouldn't notice him.  They were only there because he was in Weezer and could care less about the Space Twins.   "Hmm... I guess that is a downside to having a side project.  Some people will only like you for your main band, but I can handle that," he said to himself.       He looked around the bar.  Rivers was there, hidden away himself, talking on his cell phone.  "Oh Mary Kate, Ashley, the three of us can have our birthday parties together... Yeah, I'll still take you to the mall afterward...," Rivers was saying into the phone.  Scott just sighed and rolled his eyes.       At that point, Scott's cell phone rang as well.  "Hey, what's goin' on, man?  You at Brian's gig?," Pat asked.       "Yeah.  What you up to?," Scott asked back.       "Oh nothing much, just on the road with the Foo Fighters...  How's Brian doing up there?"       "Pretty good," Scott said.       "That's cool.  Gotta go now.  Dave and I are going to have a drum off.  Later!," Pat said before hanging up.       Scott was sad, thinking about what Pat was doing.  He could be there, too, if he had only said yes when Pat offered him Murph's old spot.       He sat in his apartment, thinking about the day Rivers tore into Brian for even mentioning the Space Twins in an interview and things Rivers had periodically said to him about side bands, often accompanied by a slashing motion across the throat or a mid-90's picture of the band with Matt ripped out of it.  Even Rivers' voice haunted him, saying "You know what happens to bassists who start their own band..."  It echoed in his brain before he went to bed.       Scott fell into a vivid dream as he fell asleep.  He found himself in an endless room full of basses.  He then heard a voice saying, "Hey! Over here!"  It was a voice he had heard before.  Scott turned toward the voice.  There was Matt Sharp sitting on a sofa fooling around with his bass.  The funny thing was that he didn't look like Matt today.  He looked like Matt from 1995, with his hair cut short.         "What are you doing here?," Scott asked with bewilderment.       "I'm the ghost of Matt Sharp and I've come to talk to you about side projects.  Here, take a seat," he said gesturing to a chair.       Scott sat down and thought for a minute.  "Wait a minute," he said, "Matt is still alive! How can you be his ghost?"       Matt's ghost thought for a minute. "Hmmm... that's a good point.  I never thought about that before...  Let's see...," the ghost said, scratching his head.  "Oh! I've got it!  I am the ghost of Matt Sharp from WEEZER.  I'm pretty sure that part of him is dead.  Is that a good explanation for you?"       "Yeah.  I guess that explains it...," Scott replied, still confused.       "Good, but we have no time to discuss that.  I hear you've been thinking about a side project of your very own.  Just to clarify, the Rentals were never a side project, they were MY BAND!," ghost Matt said.       "Yeah, yeah. I know...," Scott said.       "Sorry. I am very sensitive about that.  Anyway, I'm sure Rivers has put you through every scare tactic in the book.  Don't let him sway you.  If you want a band of your very own, then do it!"       "What???," Scott said.       "You heard me," the ghost of Weezer Matt replied.  "If you truly want to start your own band, who can stop you?  Only you can stop yourself.  Rivers doesn't control your life.  Besides, you look like you could kick his ass if he ever started shit with you anyway.  You're a scary guy."       "Ummm... thanks I guess... but, you know, I only look like a scary brute.  Inside I am very sensitive."       "Aren't we all...?  Most guys, however, would never admit it."       "So what are you up to these days?," Scott asked.       "Well, you probably already know the real deal is out on the road with his solo act.  I've been really bored lately because of that."       "Why is that?"       "Well all these kids who only see the real me because I was in Weezer go out to the shows and heckle me.  They remind the real Matt of times he was acting like an idiot, usually drunk off his ass.  Or would that be my ass?  Anyway, when kids ask him about Weezer and such it does the haunting for me."       "That sucks," Scott said.       "Well, anyway, do what you really want to do.  Good luck," Matt's Weezer ghost said as the dream world faded out.       The next day, Scott began to plan his big side project.  "Okay, I will have to work on making my voice super scary.  I might even want the guitarist I hire to have a scary voice too for added effect.  Oh man, we have to be totally heavy metal.  I never get to rock out to my fullest with Weezer."  He even made posters to put around the area:  BRAND NEW HEAVY METAL BAND  LOOKING FOR HARDCORE DRUMMER  AND GUITARIST WITH SCARY VOICE.  SCARY LOOK A PLUS.  MISSION: TO BRING THE ROCK BACK TO THE KIDDIES!  CALL 555-0711 FOR AUDITION.       Plenty called to audition with Scott over the next week.  He finally settled on two heavily pierced and tattooed guys who were also very talented.  The guitarist went by the name "Murder" and the drummer was named Steve.  Scott, Steve, and Murder decided to name their band Thicker than Blood and immediately started practicing songs Scott had written during his time of boredom.       Eventually, the band got out there and began playing gigs and such.  They even began to lay down tracks for an album.  Scott's band built up a small following and the potential for success grew larger by the day.  Unfortunately, the amount of time Scott had off from Weezer also grew shorter by the day.       Soon, the dreaded day had arrived.  Scott received a phone call from Rivers.  "Hey Scott," Rivers said, "I think I've had enough time off.  Let's get back to the studio tomorrow so we can start on album 5.  After that, we can go back to some heavy duty touring.  I know you've been really bored, so I bet you can't wait..."       "Umm... yeah... sure... that will be great!," Scott said nervously.       "I thought you'd be more excited," Rivers said.       "No, it's just that i've gotten used to having all this free time.  It will just be a while before I get back into the groove of doing all the heavy duty Weez work again," Scott said, still nervous.       "Well be at the studio tomorrow at 10 a.m.  No later!," Rivers said sternly.       Scott didn't know what to do.  His band was ready to break beyond underground, but now he was being dragged back into his Weezer world.  He always said that Weezer would be his top priority, but now Scott wasn't so sure.  He was enjoying his life in a side project, but, alas, it was only a side project.  He had to tell the other guys that they might not be doing any more work for a while.       Scott, Steve, and Murder had a meeting a few days later.  "Listen, guys," Scott said, "I'm in another band.  I started this one as a side project to kill boredom while we had all this time off in my other band, but now they want to get together and start working again.  That means that we can't do anything for a while.  I hope you understand."       "Just curious," Steve said, "but what other band are you in?"       "Weezer.  Didn't you guys know that?," Scott replied.       Steve began uncontrollably laughing.  "Weezer?  You're shitting me, right?  Weezer! Ha! What a funny joke!  What band are you really in, Scott?"       "I told you Steve.  Weezer," Scott said.       Steve continued to laugh.  "Weezer is a geek band.  You're not a geek, are you?"       "I'm there to take some of the geekiness away from the band.  Do you have a problem with that?  If so, you can leave this band," Scott said with anger bubbling within him.       "I don't want to be in a band with any geeks," Steve said, walking out the door.       "What about you, Murder?," Scott asked.       Murder was silent as usual for a minute, but then he spoke up.  "I understand.  I have to go back to my band as well."       The only time anyone really heard Murder's voice was when he was screaming into the microphone.  Murder almost never spoke in conversation, but when Scott heard him speak, his voice sounded familiar.  "Rivers? Is that you?," Scott asked, "What are you doing here?"       Murder removed his wig of long, black hair and took off his clip-on piercings.  "Yeah.  It's me," he said, "I just wanted to rock out.  Besides, I thought I told you never to start a side project."  Scott, out of patience at that point, was about ready to pound him, but then Rivers said, "I'm just fucking with you.  Relax.  I'll let you have this side band as long as you tell no one about my alter ego."       "Man, I still can't believe you're Murder.  Are those tatoos for real?," Scott asked.       "No.  They rub right off.  See?," Rivers said rubbing his arm.  "Do we have a deal, Scott?  Can I secretly be a metal god and you have a side band."       "Okay," Scott replied, "but on one condition.  You remember that this is MY band.  Don't you dare try to take over.  I'll let you do whatever the hell you want with Weezer as long as you let me do whatever the hell I want with this band."       Rivers thought for a moment.  "Deal," he said, shaking Scott's hand.       Later on, the band found a new drummer who was even more hardcore than the first.  His name was Joe and he had no qualms about Weezer or the fact that this band was just a side project.  In fact, Joe had a job of his own, so it worked out better that way for him.       The band never really did get that successful, nor did they last very long.  Joe wanted to spend more time with his family, Scott got bored with the whole thing, and Murder went on to become the newest guitarist for Limp Bizkit.  THE END

      (note: This was originally published on my old website  urlLink "Weezer and Stuff" )  Adventures with Mikey  Episode 2:  Worship Me Like An Idol       "Dammit, we're out of milk!," Brian shouted.  He was already having a bad morning.  The water in the shower was cold, his favorite shirt needed to be washed and pressed, and now there was no milk for his cornflakes.       "Oh yeah," Mikey said, "I used it up last night when I made my giant bowl of chocolate pudding."       "WHAT??," Brian said, "You used up all the milk on PUDDING??? I just bought milk the other day!"       "Sorry," Mikey replied, paying more attention to his video game than Brian.       "You didn't even write it down on the grocery list!," Brian yelled.       "So...?," Mikey replied.       "Well, you're going to have to go out and buy some more milk," Brian said like a parent to a misbehaving child.       "Right now?," Mikey whined, "I'm on the verge of beating this game."       "Well that's why they made the save function," Brian said as Mikey mocked him while he wasn't looking.       Rivers walked in the room as the conversation unfolded.  "Hey Mikey, since you're going out, could you pick up some things for me, too?," he asked.       "Yeah, whatever," Mikey said getting up and heading out the door.       As Mikey headed down the street, he noticed this really hot girl standing in this really long line.  He decided to go up and talk to her.       "Hey, babe, what's going on here?," he asked her.       "Oh, like, I'm just, like, auditioning for, like, this show.  It's, like, called American Idol.  I, like, can't believe you, like, never heard of it," she said.       "Oh yeah, I've heard of it... yeah...," Mikey said, trying to think of what show she was talking about.       "I'm, like, going to be on, like, TV.  Like, ohmigod, I am, like, going to be famous," the girl continued.         The girl seemed quite dense, but Mikey didn't care.  SHE WAS HOT!!!  "Maybe I can bang her after her audition," he thought.  He continued listening to her useless chatter in hopes that he could at least get a telephone number out of her.       A long amount of time had passed.  Mikey had almost fallen asleep listening to the girl go on and on.  Eventually, they had reached the front of the line and some guy was yelling at him.       "HEY YOU!," the man said loudly, "GET YOUR ASS IN HERE IF YOU WANT TO AUDITION!!!"         Before Mikey could respond, the people behind him shoved him into the building.  He unwillingly filled out all kinds of forms and lied about his age, saying he was 25.  After doing so, he looked around for the girl he was talking to, but she was nowhere to be found.       Mikey was escorted into a room.  "What will you be performing?," a young woman asked him.       "Ummm..." Mikey was put on the spot.  He had no clue what to do.  "I will be performing 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' by Cyndi Lauper."  The girl gave Mikey a funny look and escorted him into another room and sarcastically wished him luck.       Mikey walked into the room. "OH MY GOD! It's Paula Abdul!," Mikey shouted.       "Thank you, sweetie, but would you sing for us?," Paula asked Mikey.       "Anything for you, Paula," Mikey said.  He broke out into his rendition of "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" as he started dancing around the room with sexual motions.  He gave Paula a sexy stare as he completed his routine.       "Yo! Yo Dawg!  That was interesting...  Dawg, maybe you should consider changing your repetoire 'cuz you're a Dawg, not a girl," said Randy.       "You're really cute," Paula said, "but I think you need to get a new song and practice a little bit more.  You have great potential, you took some risks, and you have this provocative streak that I like.  Come back next time with a little bit more practice and a song that better fits you and your personality."       "I love you Paula," Mikey said.       "I know," Paula replied.       "Well I know I never want to see you here ever again," Simon interrupted, "That was dreadful.  You are not fit to be an idol.  I've never seen anything more horrid in my life."       Mikey, with his feelings hurt, hung his head as he walked out the door.  Before he left, however, he had to say one more thing.  "Paula, can I have your number?," he asked.       "I don't think so," she said, as security men finally drug Mikey out of the building.       "Dammit," Mikey said as he walked down the street to the store, "I lost out against two babes today."  A couple months later...       "Yo, Yo Dawg!," Pat yelled as he ran into the house, jumped on the couch and turned on the TV.  "It's time for a new season of American Idol."       "Since when have you been interested in reality-based, talent show programming?," Brian asked.       "Since whenever," he replied.  "Besides, Randy cracks me up with all his 'dawg' speak.  I wonder what he sounds like when he's ordering a hot dog... Yo dawg! Give me a hot dog, dawg!"       Brian rolled his eyes but then reluctantly looked at the screen.  "Who is that?," Brian asked.       "Dude, that's Paula Abdul.  Remember her?  You know, 'Coldhearted Snake.'  Hot isn't she?," Scott said, entering the room and looking at the television.       "No," Brian said, "I'm talking about the contestant.  He looks an awful lot like --"       "-- Hey guys, what's up?," Mikey interrupted as he strolled in the room.       Brian did a double take, as did Pat and Scott.  "Mikey, is that you?," Brian asked.       Mikey looked at the television.  "Well, what do you know? It is me.  I didn't think they put the bad ones on TV...," he said.       "You met Paula Abdul," Scott said, "and you didn't tell me?"       "Dude, you're on TV!," Pat added, "Normally it's me that's always on TV.  Finally, I think the curse has been broken."       "We should be taping this," Scott said.       "Shhhhh...," Brian said, "I want to hear."       They all intently watched Mikey make a fool out of himself on national television.       "You picked 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun'?  You're such an idiot!  Surely, you could have picked something better to sing," Brian said.       "Man, you've got to be proud of yourself.  You invaded our television space.  Way to go!," Pat said.       "I can't believe it... You met Paula Abdul...," Scott said.       "I can't believe they didn't find you out," Brian said, "You're obviously overage for this escapade.  Not to mention, you were our bassist.  You'd think somebody would have recognized you..."       Mikey just shrugged.  "Hey stuff like that happens, I guess..."       "YOU met PAULA ABDUL," Scott said.       "Yes, Scott, I did.  She was fine, man," Mikey said.       "I've had enough of this," Brian said, "I'm going to my room."       "Yeah, that sounds like a good idea," Mikey added.  "Can I join you?," he asked winking at Brian.       "Ummm... okay..., but I'm just going to watch a DVD or something.  I suppose you can join me," Brian said hesitantly.       "Yay!," Mikey said, giving Brian a hug.       "You really can get off me," Brian said, dragging Mikey to his room.       "Wait!," Scott quickly turned around and yelled, "Mikey! Did you get Paula's number?"

      (note: this was originally published on my former website  urlLink "Weezer and Stuff" )  Adventures with Mikey  Episode 1:  Don't Go in the Closet  January 2002       It was about noon in the "Weezer-hood", as Pat so creatively called it.  Pat lived next door to the giant mansion where Rivers lived and kept Brian and Scott.  Karl also lived on the complex in the poolhouse for convenience, unlike the other band members who lived on the property because Rivers wanted to keep an eye on them.       Rivers rolled out of bed and shuffled groggily toward the kitchen.  There he saw Scott, in sweats, all messy and sweaty from his daily regiment of pumping iron.  Scott was making himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.       "Sandwiches time?," Rivers asked him.       "Yup," Scott Replied.       "Where's Brian?," Rivers asked, looking around the room.       Scott smirked.  "I've got 20 dollars saying that he will come out of the shower in about 15 minutes.  He's already been in there for two-and-a-half hours."       Rivers immediately snickered and then thought for a brief moment.  "I'm in!  I say Brian will take another hour."  Rivers then proceeded to pour himself a bowl of cereal.  As Rivers started to pour milk into the bowl, Brian finally exited the bathroom.       Brian whistled as he left the steamy bathroom.  As he walked down the hallway, he passed a full length mirror.  Brian stopped and then went back to the mirror.  He gazed at himself for a minute.  He played with his hair a little and then flashed himself a huge smile. "Hey, guys," he said, as he walked into the room.       Scott laughed.  "Pay up, bro," he said to Rivers.       Rivers responded with a laugh of his own.  "No way!  You said 15 minutes, not five."       "I was closer.  Pay up!"       "Shut up, biotch!  I'm not gonna pay you!"       After about a minute of fighting, Scott rolled his eyes and gave a deep sigh.  "Fine.  We'll call it a draw.  Fair enough?"       Brian looked puzzled.  He had no clue what just went on.  "Ummm... guys?  What's going on?"       Scott turned bright red.  "Oh.  Nothing," he said quietly.       "Oh...," Brian replied.  He maintained the look of bewilderment for a minute, but then his face changed back to a huge grin.  "I'm gonna do my laundry, guys,"  he said, walking back out of the room.       Just then, there was a knock at the door.  Scott answered the knocking.  It was Pat.       "Hey, Pat, what's going on?," asked Scott.       "Oh, not much.  My woman's making me do some chores, so I decided to sneak over here," Pat replied.       "Cool.  Make yourself at home.  I have to take a shower, though,"  Scott replied.       Pat eyed Scott over.  Scott was still all messy from his workout.  "Brian finally got out, eh?," he laughed.  "Trust me.  I don't mind.  By the looks of you, you need it."  Scott pretended to look offended for a minute, but then laughed and headed off for the bathroom.       Brian had entered the room during the conversation.  He looked baffled again.  "I got out of what?," Brian asked, in response to the comment Pat had made about Brian finally finishing his primming.       Pat paused for a minute, remembering that comment.  "Uhh...  nothing.  I'm going to play some video games, okay?"       "Okay!,"  Brian said, a huge smile returning to his face.       Brian continued his laundry, Pat began playing video games, Scott was in the shower, and Rivers was finishing his breakfast.  Just then, the phone rang.  Rivers, sitting near the phone, answered it.  "Hello?"       "Hey, it's me," Karl said on the other end, "Pat's wife just came over here looking for him.  Is he at your place?"       "Yeah..."       "Well, you'd better hide him, because she's coming over."       "Shit!"       "Good luck figuring out what to do.  Talk to you later!"       Rivers frantically hung up the phone as Brian walked through the kitchen, dusting off his hands.  Rivers grabbed him and frantically ran into the living room where Pat was playing video games.       "Okay, here's the deal.  Pat, you're wife is coming over, so we have to hide you somewhere.  Brian!  You must keep Pat's wife busy while we hide him.  You'll know when Pat's hidden when I meet up with you guys, got it?"       Brian smiled again.  "Okay!"       "Now, where are we going to hide you...?," Rivers muttered.       "How about under Scott's bed?," Pat suggested.       "No!  That's a stupid idea!"       "She's coming," Brian yelled from the other room.       "Here we go," Rivers said, "This closed over here should be perfect."  Rivers grabbed the doorknob.  "Shit!  The door is jammed.  It won't open"       Conveniently, Scott walked by, fresh out of the shower.  "Are you guys having trouble?  Here, let me get it."       Scott rammed himself into the door, and it opened.  All three looked in.  "OH MY GOD!!!!," they yelled upon seeing what had been trapped in the closet.       "What the hell is that?,"  Scott said.       "Holy Shit!,"  Pat said in utter amazement.       "So that's where he went!," Rivers added.       In a heap, Mikey was lying in the closet.  He was a complete mess.       "Is he dead?," Pat asked, "because I'm not hiding with a dead guy."       "Get in here or else you'll be dead, too," Rivers said, pushing him into the closet.       Pat looked around the dark closet.  "Man, it smells gross in here, but I suppose you wouldn't smell the best if you were trapped in a closet for several months.  I should take his pulse, but I'm afraid to touch him.  He is so nasty."       Just then, Mikey began to twich and groan.  He slowly opened his eyes.  "Duuuuuuuuude.  Pat?  How did you get in here, man?  Am I dead?"       "No, I'm hiding from my wife.  How on earth did you get here?"       "First tell me, how did you get in here?"       "Ummm... the door?"       "No, like, the door was locked."       "You locked yourself in here?"       "It was scary, man.  It feels like I've been trapped in here forever.  How long has it been, like three, four days?"       "Try more like four or five... MONTHS!!!!"       "Holy shit! That's a long time.  I could really go for a cigarette.  Do you have any on you?"       "I quit!  You knew that!"       Scott then opened the door, letting the two of them out.  "She's gone now, Pat."       "Who the hell are you?," Mikey asked, eyeing up Scott.       "I'm Scott.  When you disappeared, Rivers hired me to take your place.  It was a temporary thing until they eventually gave up looking for you."       "Well pack your bags, fucker, I'm back!"       "Excuse me?"       "You heard me!"       "Mikey," Pat interrupted, "why don't you take a shower and clean yourself up.  You look disgusting.  Rivers, Brian, and I will decide what to do."       "Yeah, so they can take me back," Mikey said with a smartass smile.       "Fuck you!," Scott yelled.       "Hey now," interrupted Pat, "Scott why don't you just chill out.  Mikey, TAKE A SHOWER!!!  Rivers, Brian, and I will discuss the situation later." Mikey stormed off to the bathroom and Scott stormed off to his room.       Later that evening, Rivers, Brian, and Pat gathered at Karl's place.  "Okay, so Mikey has returned.  What are we going to do?," Rivers said, starting the meeting.       "Go shopping!," Brian yelled with a cheesy grin.  Everybody shot Brian a dirty look.  He shrank back into his chair.  "Just... kidding... guys..."       "Well, we can't just get rid of Scott," Pat said, continuing the meeting.       "...but we can't just kick Mikey out on his ass either," Brian added.       "If you ask me," Pat continued, "Scott is a much better bassist."       "Scott is an awesome bassist, but Mikey was good, too, and he has nowhere to go.  I would feel bad if Mikey was left out in the cold," Brian said.       "...but Scott better fits the sound we have going on now," Pat argued back.       "Alright already!," Rivers yelled, sick of the fighting.  "Here's what we're going to do..."       The next morning, a meeting was called, this time with both Mikey and Scott present.  "Mikey.  Scott," Rivers said, commencing the meeting. "We have come to a decision."  Mikey and Scott looked at each other and then they both looked down at the floor.  Rivers continued, "Scott, for you, things will be the same as before.  You will still play bass for us."       "YEEEEESSSS!!!!," Scott yelled.       Mikey grew teary eyed and began to sniffle.  "What about me, Rivers?"       "You will live here, but you will help out around the house.  Since Scott is staying in your old cell... err... room, you will be living in Pat's old room.  Helping out around the house will include cleaning and other random tasks.  You'll do, basically, whatever I tell you to do."       Mikey ran up to Rivers and gave him a big hug.  "Thank you! I won't let you down.  I looooooove you!"       "Mikey, you can let go now," an almost suffocated Rivers choked out.

      Hi, Becca here!  Sometimes I get bored and when I get bored I often like to write little stories.  Here are my little stories.  The first few were orignially posted on Jenny's and my (now defunct) website "Weezer and Stuff".  I hope you all enjoy these stories and I should be writing some new ones shortly!

      Ugh. Today has been so pointless. After dragging my ass out of bed finally at 11:00, I walked the half-hour walk to Fazolis to check my schedule and I'm on the schedule again now, but I have NO FUCKING HOURS. Not one measly hour. I was so pissed. To top it off, on the way there when I stopped by the bank, I found out I have only about $391 left in my checking account. That's just wonderful. Of course, what better way to cure my pain then to go to Goodwill? It always makes me feel better that for under $30, I can buy 3 pairs of pants, 3 sweaters, a blouse and a book bag. Amazing, simply amazing considering one of the pairs of pants is Aeropostale, powder blue, like new. They are like doctors' scrubs, they are already my favorite pair, they are so comfortable. So now I am $30 poorer, but feel slightly better. I was starving when I finally came home so I broke out the veggie chicken patties and made myself a sandwich. Oh, this was after taking a shower of course cuz I just felt so nasty after all that walking. Thinking back, I should have walked AFTER eating so the fat doesn't settle to my thighs and ass like it seems to do. You know it is really sad when the most exciting part of one's day is taking a 30-minute walk to work. It would be so nice to have a car, but just simply MOVING sounds nice to me. I just hope that Becca doesn't freak out at the last minute and not come, I don't know what I would do if I couldn't move out with her. She doesn't believe she is worth anything though, and when she interviews with that attitude, it shows to the employer, and of course they don't hire people like that. She is so smart and good at things that could help her in her career. Like she's creative, and not cheesy like I am, and she is so much more intelligent and motivated than me, and she isn't lazy like I am. I still believe I can get a PR job though, with or without my internship. I think going to L.A. could be the wisest decision for both of us, since they don't seem to like creativity and being laid-back so much in Michigan, or the eastern U.S. in general it seems. I just hope I'm right in this. I figure though, if kids can move to L.A. straight out of high school to live there (like my cousin Erin, and she's living in Anaheim, in a nice apartment) certainly can Becca and I, one with a Bachelor's degree already and another on her way to getting one in May. Everyone needs to take a chance in their life, and I hope that I don't have to do this alone, it won't be as fun. I'm lonely now being in Mt. Pleasant, and I know this area, I can't imagine doing this in a strange city like 3,000 miles from here. Enough about this depressing talk though, I think things will turn out fine in terms of myself and for Becca too, I don't wanna let the fears drag me down- what about all the fun stuff? Like ordering chinese at 4 a.m.? Going to Spaceland to watch some local band perform? Curing boredom some weekend by checking out all the cute shops on the Sunset Strip? Or riding scooters around Venice Beach? Geeze, I know this sounds all naive and shit, but it isn't like I've never been to L.A. before. Although I'll have a job and won't get to do this fun stuff all the time, at least I have these options, and that is better than what I have now. Okay, I sounded all pissy and depressed earlier, but I feel better now. So with that said, maybe I'll fix myself a nice dinner and relax...

      So... Today was interesting... I learned that I am not a great cook but I can make edible food at least. I tried making omelettes today and well, it turned out okay but I wound up burning mine =( I guess I need to practice more, but I'm not sure I want to eat eggs for a while now, maybe I will just stick to ordering omelettes at Big Boy instead of trying to be Julia Child. At least my cookies from last night turned out good even though they are humongous. Yes, CMU got their ass kicked today by U of M but I just laughed, cuz i was glad that we scored against U of M AT ALL. Like I say, I didn't go to Central for our sports teams. I got to actually get stuff I needed today too, I got some of those oh so sexy safety goggles for my chemistry 101 class, mini-disks for audio production (even though it took me 3 stores to find them. There is something seriously wrong when the girls at Staples didn't even know what a minidisk was- what kind of people are we hiring these days for office supplies stores, really), and I FINALLY got Microsoft Office and realized how much I hate the microsoft corporation. They are a bunch of capitalist pigs who have a monopoly over everything and I can't even use my office XP program until I've registered and to top that off, I can get fined if I am not a student or teacher using the software...What the fuck? So does that mean I can't use it anymore when I'm not a student? I spend the fucking $140 for the fucking software, I better be able to use the damn thing! So yeah, I think corporations in the U.S. are maybe taking these copyright laws JUST a little too far... So yeah, what to do now...I am not really sure. I finally found a color scheme for this journal and I hope it isn't too calm for Jenny, I just liked the relaxing colors, if I tried to get colors to fit my personality I don't know if the text would be comfortably readable. In fact, it probably would be like fire-engine red, day-glo orange and neon green. Very tacky, just like me. So instead, this journal shall show the tranquil side of Jenny, the Jenny that just sits on the floor in a yoga position with her eyes turned to the sky, as confused as a newborn whispering "where am I?" Heehee, I bet you can't picture that, can you? Okay, enough rambling for now. I'm gonna go eat some ice cream, yummy!

      YAY!!!! Justin is coming over! I'm so excited. He is supposed to be here in like a half hour. Anyway, I almost had a heart attack when I remembered at 3:00 that I had to email my sociology professor by 5:00 today with those interview questions and I hadn't even answered my half of the questions! YIKES! Thankfully I did get it done by 4:00 though, so assuming the e-mail got sent, it should all be good about now. Other than that, I found this really cool picture of brian playing guitar on the Weezer site which I rarely even visit anymore, in fact, I have to remind myself to visit there, because sadly, I'm afraid this next album is going to flop. Hopefully it will be good though, because being the devoted fan that I am, I will probably still buy it, but will be very disappointed if it sucks. I just wish that Brian was able to do more Space Twins stuff....sadly, I'm a bigger Space Twins fan than I am a Weezer fan. What did you expect? If you really know me, you would know that Space Twins is way more up my alley than Weezer is. Plus, the infestation of 15 year old emo-posers and Teeny Boppers have ruined the essence of what Weezer was back in like 1995. Alas, those days are gone, but at least there is Blue album and Pinkerton to remind me of those days... So...Not much else to say except that I think I got the BCA 329 business cleared up and I will be working on what sounds to be 3 awesome shows this fall. One is Central View which is a staple at MHTV, basically a variety show that does music/movie reviews with some extra fun stuff. Another one is called "jam session" which profiles artists, does live concert tapings, band interviews, and even some in-studio gigs, and the last one which sounds like it will be crazy is called "The Tour", which is live concert tapings at Rubbles (a bar in Mt. P). I know that I can't dedicate loads of time to each and every show, but I can help out with what I can and get those 45 hours of practicum credit I need for the semester so I can be out of here in December. Not to mention, I have to make room for the radio station promotions I signed up to do also. Man, I am so setting myself up for a career in Music publicity. Don't be surprised if you don't see me on tour with some snazzy L.A. band in the future! (I hope)

      I hate skanks. Grrr!!!! These three chicks at the computer across from me can't figure out that a library is supposed to be QUIET??? Stupid dumbass freshmen. I can't wait until I'm out of here, my intelligence feels so deficient when i'm around some of the stupid, shallow and rude people who go to school here. Okay, not everyone is bad, but a majority are. Today is going to be such a bitch, I started class at 10:00 this morning and I am going to be on campus until almost 9, because I have those meetings for the radio and TV station so I can get registered for my BCA practicum so I can actually leave Michigan for my internship in the spring. I emailed the prof. about it last night, but I still haven't got a reply yet. Hopefully he will be at the meeting tonight so I can talk to him about it. No food or sleep till tonight...how sad. Justin is coming up tomorrow though and I don't have any classes. Yay! CMU is going to get their ass kicked by U of M on Saturday, I can hardly wait, i think i'm going to bake a cake. Hell, I think I'm going to root for U of M because although Central is my soon-to-be alma mater, I still think our football team sucks. I'm so hungry right now!!! I can't think about food, I only have one dollar and I have to use it wisely, like on a snickers bar of course...I still have 2 more classes today...yucky. I didn't even finish reading business ethics because I fell asleep reading the book like 3 times. It isn't that it is boring, it is just my attention span is so horrible. The only time I can keep my attention reading is if it is literature, and even then, the story has to hold my attention. I think I'm going to try to read Camus, or some Irvine Welsh (he wrote Trainspotting and Glue), I'm in the mood for a good fucked up story with booze and drugs galore, since well, it is much better to read about it than actually be living that life. Oh, and I got a new counter in honor of Davey, it's PENGUINS!!! Aren't they cute? Truth is, they were the cutest, non-cheesy counter I saw, and something told me I couldn't resist the penguins. maybe I should start a countdown until the end of the semster, only 15 more weeks to go!!!

      Okay, I think I finally found a place to put my twisted thoughts. I was using my-diary.org, but the white text on black background made me dizzy and I was constantly forgetting the password that I didn't even get to choose. GRRRR!!!! So anyway, I'm spazzing now. I have to find an internship in L.A. and I still have to sign up for my BCA 329 class for this semester so I can graduate in May and am actually able to leave for California in January. Well, I really can't do much until tomorrow, when the meetings for the broadcasting stations are. I seriously think I've decided on MHTV since I think I'm going to be applying to more television/film oriented internships. Plus, I've already worked at the radio station, so It will make me more well-rounded I suppose. I guess no one wants to hear about this though, since that is all I seem to talk about cuz that is primarily on my mind. On another note, I'm gonna have the firmest ass and legs after this semester, this bike riding is really gonna kill me. I woke up with sore legs again, so I decided to walk to class today, it is only about a 20 minute walk...and it's nice outside. I love the library, I don't have to feel guilty for being online. I swear, Liz probably gets so annoyed with me being online every night until really late so maybe I'll just start giving myself a bedtime of like 1a.m. every night, I should do that anyway, since I'll have to get up early in the winter after I have my internship. You know, what the hell is a BLOG? Who came up with that word? It reminds me of the word puke, i don't know why. When i think of blog i think of someone puking on the kitchen floor. Sorry, too much information i suppose...I have the shortest attention span, I can't sit and do something for more than five minutes, like ANYTHING. I tried to read my abortion case study last night and got like halfway through it and then got bored. I guess that is bad...I don't even know if i'll get around to reading my business ethics chapter. I always say i'll read and do homework at the beginning of the semester, but by the time classes have been in for a month, i've already given up. That is probably why my gpa is a 3.2 (not even, it's a 3.199)not that that is a bad gpa or anything...I'm so bored, I wish Becca was online, even though I think she got mad at me last night and left cuz i was not talking a lot. I think I was tired or really out of it. Plus I think I'm afraid that my roommate is going to just start yelling at me and telling me to not go online anymore. I mean she doesnt say anything, but I think I'm so used to having privacy that I get paranoid when other people are around. Of course I asked her if i can interview her for my damn SOC 300 class, it is really stupid questions too. Like "what factors have led to your development at CMU? " or some shit like that. I hate questions like that. But i need to know how to research I suppose if i'm going to be working in PR....I just wanna be out of college. I don't want to work either though...I guess the simple fact is, I want to be anywhere but here. HERE, MICHIGAN. I want to be in California...only four more months! Okay, now i'm just blabbing so I should just stop talking now or i'm never going to shut up. Maybe I'll go check out a book here before I go to my audio production lecture at 4...man, I love wednesdays this semester!!!

      I HATE SCHOOL!!!!!!!!!!!! I have had it with schoolwork and everything that goes into it. My cfs is probably going to go completely wacko this weekend too. I've been so stressed out this week. I had to skip my audio production lecture for the second week in a row because I had a fucking sociology paper to finish before 5:00 today and I finished it at about 3:30 and my class was at 4:00, so needless to say, I had to miss the class...I know it's my fault because I could have written the paper over the weekend, but I'm a horrible procrastinator. Also, I was so pissed because I was planning on doing my audio lab this morning so I wouldn't have to worry about getting up early on Friday to do it, but of course as luck would have it, there were three other people in the lab working on their projects that I just finished last week- so i'm guessing they must be from the thursday and friday labs-lucky bastards, I have a monday lab. So I got so frustrated that I just left after fiddling around for an hour and just signed up to go on Friday in the only available time slot- 8 a.m. So if anyone thinks about talking to me on Friday, don't count on it, I'm going to probably be sleeping until about 6 p.m. Tomorrow I will be going from about 9 a.m. until about 4 a.m. Friday morning THEN I have that damn lab to finish friday at 8 a.m. I don't even see the use in getting any sleep, because I will be just getting to bed then I'll have to wake up again. I just REALLY hope I don't have to run camera this time around...I'll try to get a job as a gaffer or something so all I have to do is worry about the cables being taped to the floor, and I get to sit back and enjoy most of the show. I'm trying not to freak out too much over the next couple of days, after I do my lab on Friday morning I have the weekend to SLEEP and catch up on my classes since I'm getting way behind and actually e-mail these places I should be e-mailing  for a spring internship. God...I wish I were in California already, because then that would mean that I don't have to worry about reading for classes and trying to do about eight things at once...I'm beginning to be obsessed about it. I really really really hope I can find an apartment in Silver Lake for Becca and I because that area looks so nice, and it is really close to downtown but not so close that it is the really icky nasty part of Los Angeles. Plus it's artsy and full of vintage thrift shops and used record stores. That is as close to Jenny paradise as you can get! Speaking of paradise...*blushes* I saw a cutie today as I was walking to the library after giving up on my audio lab...my old next door neighbor Nick, the hot organ major who is super duper anal retentive but that still didn't stop me from having wicked fantasies about him. Some women fantasize about their mechanics, I fantasize about Nick. I wasn't even thinking as I crossed through the music building, It didn't even occur to me that I might see him until I heard him talking to someone and I looked over and he noticed me and smiled *blushes again* Me being the shy little chicken shit I am made brief eye contact with him, and kinda ducked my head and kept walking, blushing of course. DAMN DAMN DAMN. It should be a sin to be that attractive, that is all I have to say...

      Okay, now that I no longer feel like i've been ran over by a train, I can write in this again. I have been so sick these past two days that I haven't even had the energy to shower or eat, which is really not good. After running myself ragged this morning finishing up that sociology 300 paper which wound up being 10 pages long, I somehow made it back to my apartment where I collapsed on my bed until 5:00. I had a really scary nightmare that I haven't had in two years. I know most people think I'm crazy, but I'm convinced that I've had a poltergeist following me since my freshman year of college which has created strange disturbances in my stuff like turning off my computer and radio and stuff, messing with my things, and even to the point where I hear voices when I wake up. To really tell the story I have to mention the nightmares I used to have when I lived in Robinson Hall two years ago, my sophomore year. I used to take afternoon naps a lot because I was really fucked up at the time due to ex boyfriend whom I will not name. So one afternoon I had a dream that it was after dark and I was walking by myself from Lot 8 on North Campus which is said to be haunted. Someone was following me so I was trying to get back to Robinson. Next thing I knew I was in my room but I wasn't alone. Someone was hovered over me and breathing really heavy in my dream. So heavy, that I could feel their breath on my skin. What made it even more creepy is they were whispering "Jenny, Jenny" in my ear. My eyes flew open and I was afraid to go back to sleep. This happened a few more times, all dreams involving someone hovering over me whispering my name. I thought it was Becca once and I asked her if she had come over (since we didn't live together at the time) but she said that she hadn't come over. I asked my roommate Sarah, and she said she hadn't come back either that day. It scared the shit out of me. I thought it was being caused by this dreamcatcher I had that was intended for my ex boyfriend so I brought it back to my parents house because I believed it was eliciting bad karma. So for almost two years I had no dreams like that. Until today. I fell into this comatose like dream state like I do when I'm sick and exhausted and in the dream it started out like I was with this man in I guess you could say a sexual situation. Next thing I knew though, he was well, raping me. This is not a dream ANYONE wants to have. I was so scared because I could hear and feel the heavy breathing against my ear, I couldn't wake up too. I wasn't sure if the breathing was my own or just my hallucinations I was having being brought on by my being sick. God, I hope I don't ever have a dream like that again. Okay, enough about freaky dreams. I want to say Rest in Peace Johnny Cash and John Ritter, you will be greatly missed. Johnny Cash was such an amazing and revolutionary musician and he made country bad ass. Any man who does a cover of a nine inch nails song at 71 is bound to rock the world. John Ritter, that was sad, I practically grew up on Three's Company. He was an amazing comedian and he died on his daughter's fifth birthday! That is so horrible. He also was a week shy of his birthday and wedding anniversary. Talk about bad timing...Okay, one more sad thing before I talk happy things and finally shut up. Yesterday in business ethics class Hope May (the professor) played this video about September 11th, (it is an ethics class after all) and this video was by far the most graphic video I have ever seen. I almost walked out of the room it disturbed me so much. I was actually crying during most of the video. These were close up shots of the planes hitting the towers and real life testimonials of men and women who made last phone calls to loved ones who knew they were going to die and just wanted to tell their husband or wife or sister, brother, mom, dad that they loved them. I cannot imagine being able to deal with a situation like that, knowing I'm going to die. I admit that as Americans we take way too many things for granted and we have an assholish president. However, NO ONE deserves that kind of trauma. I remember two years ago vividly, and although my roommate and her selfishness made the situation worse, I just remember having to turn off the news because I couldn't handle seeing all those people in pain. I felt guilty almost that I got to live and these people had to sacrifice their lives for a holy war being enacted against our country and all the principles we stand for. I wish the leaders and citizens of this country would wake up and see that we cannot bend others to our will. If we just let other nations live their life out in peace, we can live ours out in peace. However, that is a naive way of looking at the world and I can't change it so what's the use in talking about it?  Now that i've got all cryptic, I'm going to tell at least one good piece of news. THE PIXIES ARE TOURING IN APRIL!!! I thought the day would never come when I would at least have the opportunity to see this revolutionary band. They are practically the gods of indie rock. How could I not see them? Of course, I have to take into consideration that I will be seeing them in L.A. so I will be competing with many more people for tickets... I may have to go to San Diego to see the show...either way, I'm going to see them! On that note, I also swear one day I'm going to see the Violent Femmes and the Cure as well. They still tour, and I need to step out of this music retardation I've been in for a majority of my life... On a side note, it is very annoying living across the street from a high school football stadium. Peace and quiet is not an option during the fall...

      Okay, I'm a lazy ass for not posting anything in a couple days. So I got (sort of ) fired from my job...the anger has pretty much dissipated though. I don't really want to go back to Fazolis that bad anyway. The job sucked and the pay was shitty and I got like 5 hours a week if i was lucky. I guess it is much easier to just concentrate on school since it's my last semester here anyway. So I just spent two hours in the computer lab earlier working on coding qualitative data analysis for my research methods class. YUCK. I didn't think it would take me TWO HOURS. Then again, I didn't think it would take me 4 hours to do a crappy radio commercial for my audio production class that I know I got a C on because it was critiqued in class and it sucked compared to everyone else's. Plus, the BCA department pentalizes the instructors if they give out too many As and Bs. Thank you Dr. Orlik.. Well at least i'm not a BCA MAJOR even though I feel like one with all the requirements they impose on me as a fucking MINOR!!!! I'm a damn PR major, I should be able to make time for PRSSA this semester but I can't. Oh well, it's not like I'd be able to do much with all this internship and moving to California stuff that I have to worry about. I really hope it pays off. I was looking at city search today and all the stuff they have in SoCal and I was almost in tears. It made me realize that there isn't SHIT in Michigan to do. NOTHING. Maybe I just need to experience some culture and that is why I'm craving a coastal city now...Grrrr...I don't want to work on my damn PR presentation stuff either. I have to come up with materials to debate on the pro-life side of abortion. For one thing, I'm not Pro-Life so that's going to be really fun...see, it's only a presentation to use PR to show the audience that abortion is an issue of truth, not ethics (my idea). Either way, I hope we get a good grade on it so I suppose I should do that in addition to that research essay...blah blah blah. Just a thought, I saw one of the new pictures at Weezer.com and Brian looks so sad, it made me feel so bad, but I suppose it could be just my imagination or I just worry too much about someone who I'd hate to see sad because well, I idolize him...*blushes* Oh well, whatever it is, I hope I get to see some happy pictures of him in the near future! While i'm on that track, I heard the cutest pick up line today: Are you from Tennessee ? Because you're the only Ten I see! Heehee, I would never use it though, it's just too damn cheesy...

      I am SO GLAD that tomorrow is Sunday. Funny, huh? Usually I look forward to weekends but yesterday was so long....First I do my audio lab at 9:00 in the morning and don't even get it finished, so I had to check out a weekend key to the audio lab. Then, I go to the video shoot at Rubbles that I thought was only going to take about 6 hours when in fact it took 9! So, I didn't even get back to my apartment until nearly 4:00 in the morning. I suppose I could look on the bright side, I got to hang out with a band and see a free funk concert, and there are 9 hours of practicum credit right there. If I were to stick with this show, there are 5 shows, and each one will probably take about 9 hours of production time, so there is 45 hours right there for five shows- there you have it, I make the requirement for Practicum. That's awesome to say the least. Of course, I didn't drink last night because I seriously didn't eat and alcohol in an empty stomach will either get me wasted REALLY quick, or it will cause me to fall asleep. I was afraid the latter would happen, because I wasn't actually doing much. I was running the wide angle stationary camera, so the only thing I was really doing was making sure people didn't block or bump the camera and changing the battery when it got low. I wasn't ready to actually run the camera where I had to actually DO STUFF like panning and zooming and stuff. Maybe next time...I swear though, it is pretty sad that Rubbles attracts the tame crowd, cuz people were still acting like drunk assholes. I didn't see too many skanks but I did see one who was like going at it with her boyfriend right in front of me, I was getting so pissed off. Cuz I think they were doing it on purpose cuz they thought they were on camera or something. What a bunch of dumbasses, thankfully they weren't in the camera's view cuz if they would have been I was fully prepared to bitch them out. Other than that, It was fun. The band was cute, and it was cool to hang out with them when they were setting up and tearing down. Of course, they were only a Lansing band, but still cool. So after I literally crashed last night when I got home and woke up at noon aching everywhere, I mean EVERYWHERE, i dragged my ass back over to the audio lab. I was there for another two hours, getting so frustrated because making a 30 second commercial with music just wasn't happening. I recorded like 30 takes, literally. After I noticed that after a certain point i was getting worse instead of better, I decided to call it a day and went through and picked my best track and went with that one to turn in. The music fades up, but it ends right when my voice does. I hope that sounds professional enough for the G.A. because, I seriously tried like 30 something times, and there is only so much you can do. I would have been in there for the next month if I were to try to get it perfect. Oh well. Man, by the time I get out of school I'm going to be so sick of broadcasting. It's kind of funny that I'm only a BCA minor yet I have to do almost as much crap as a major does. Hopefully that will be of some use to me in the future...One more thing: carrying two bags of groceries in paper sacks two  blocks from the grocery store is NOT fun when it is 80 degrees outside!

      Okay, I was so fed up with my brother's computer last night, I didn't even want to write in here I was so pissed at it. The little pointer thingy on the laptop went wacko so I couldn't use it anymore. That wouldn't be a problem if I didn't need an external keyboard because the "M" "." and "," keys don't work AT ALL. So what did I do? Well I plugged in the mouse and had to copy and paste m's whenever I needed them. What a pain in the ass. So I just said fuck it, I'm getting like 200 feet of phone cord and running it into my bedroom so I can use my own computer to go online from now on. I just hope Liz or Christy don't trip over it. I guess I will have to warn them beforehand. Other than that the only noteable part of yesterday was being followed into audio production by this cute FRESHMAN who started flirting with me. I wound up explaining to him who the Space Twins and the Rentals were. It was quite entertaining, especially when I realized that he wasn't even in my class!!! It was flattering, but also kinda creepy.  So yeah, I was very subtly like "IM A SENIOR"  "THIS IS MY LAST SEMESTER" "IM MOVING TO CALIFORNIA." Hehee, kind of ironic but I bet when I'm in L.A. looking for a man, there will be none interested in me...how depressing. You know what else is depressing? The Space Twins can't be played on 91.5 unless I get permission from the lable. Wouldn't that mean that I have to get permission from the band? Yeah, that means somehow I have to get in contact with Brian...yeah, that should be REALLY easy. So yeah, I have to email Keith, so I can get Brian's email for business purposes. I see that happening....

      Hmm...Not much to say about today. I (sort of) cheated on the lab with the student body president of CMU today in Chem, but no one really has to know about that...plus sharing answers isn't really cheating is it? I got to learn how to use NUD*IST in Sociology today (no, not THAT kind of Nudist, you sicko! It's a spreadsheet program for research) and I got out of Business Ethics early. YAY!!! My prof. for that class makes me want to go to Law School cuz she is going to Law School and she is so fucking cool! But I've had enough with school for awhile, I just want the fuck out! I then went to the Central View meeting which did me little good considering I'm not a producer for the show, and am crew. There would be little point in me being a producer because they would need to find a replacement for me at the end of the semester since I won't be here in Mt. Pleasant in the spring... See how exciting my life is? I don't know what to do with myself right now cuz I finished all my homework yesterday, now all I really have to worry about is stuff for Thursday or my first paper for Soc 300. I can hardly wait! I can't believe that I've already been in classes for over a week now. I found a new shortcut to campus too, so now it only takes about 8 minutes to bike to class instead of 15! Oh, and for the record, I really love the word FUCK. If you hadn't already guessed that already...

      Wow, what a labor day today has been. I've been laboring away too. I have seriously never studied or done this much homework in one day in my entire LIFE. I realize now that I'm a slacker. First, i drag myself (sort of) out of bed only to watch "I love the 70s" on VH1 for two hours. I realize that I was born in the wrong fucking decade!!! For one thing I remember a lot of the stuff they talk about because a lot of it kinda went into the early 80s. I must say though Leif Garrett is HOT!!! I'd totally do him even now, even though he's probably like almost 20 years older than me....If i were like 10 years older, which would make me almost 33, it wouldn't be as big of a problem...Oh well, I can't really do much about when I was born, I guess I can just hope there are men out there who wouldn't mind robbing the cradle a little...(I won't name any more names though- is 12 years really robbing the cradle? *wink*) So yeah, I try studying in my apartment but that just doesn't seem to fly so I decide to walk to the library around 2:00ish, the fucking library doesn't open until 6:00! I was so pissed, so I had to haul my ass back to my apartment, but at least I had the Space Twins to keep me company on the 15 minute walk back...Nothing like listening to Trudy Truelove while crossing the crosswalk...So I go back and decide to do some more reading. What do I hear? My roommate on the other side of the wall complaining about her boyfriend about him not going to some family function this weekend because he has some student teaching application stuff he has to do. Hmmm...let's think here, what is more important? Don't get me wrong, she's a sweetheart, but she is also the biggest airhead I know. I think her brain got stuck somewhere in fourth grade. God, I feel like such a bitch talking mean about her, she wouldn't hurt a fly. I'm just bitter because girls who can just mold their boyfriends into whatever they want, and here I am, bitter and single....grrrr!!!! So I finally got my reading done, and of course I lay down to take a nap and I kept getting woken up by things, Finally I stay awake after my brother calls and tells me he is trying to get discharged from the army so he can stay home, get a drivers license and get an accounting degree. I sure hope they let him out. If he didn't want to do combat in the military when we are in the middle of a fucking war, why did he join? I love him to death though, so I hope they don't give him shit about getting out. To add to my exciting day, I go to make myself dinner and find out my garlic and butter angelhair pasta is made with chicken fat!!! ewww...mom, I'm a vegetarian, remember? So as i was in the middle of cooking it I noticed that so i had to dump the stuff down the garbage disposal. That is just disgusting. I finally fixed that problem and had some fettuccini alfredo which is NOT made with animal products (except dairy, which I eat) and finally set about answering the longest questions ever for business ethics. My brain is so fried with moral reasoning right now. Sorry to bore y'all with my Loooong entry. Oh, by the way, there is a picture in my chemistry book of the Knoxville, TN road sign, how cute.

      So I had this homoerotic dream last night...with my best (female) friend...it was really weird. No, I won't share details, because it was so graphic and all, but she knows who she is, since I told her about it. Still, it's weird when you have dreams like that and you're straight. I don't know, I could totally be bisexual and not have a problem with it if it weren't for the fact that I'm completely in love with a man i've never even met. It wouldn't be so bad, but he is no where near Michigan, he probably already has a girl and he is so much like me it's creepy. No, I'm not making this up, everyone tells me I'm just like him. Yes, I'm playing the pronoun game because I want to protect his identity even though the only people who probably ever read this are my friends who already know who I am speaking of. Anyway, just thought I'd talk about how I have fantasies about chicks too and am totally cool admitting it. Heehee, I bet my dad would just love that, he's so straight laced. He'd have a coronary if I dated a man more than 5 years older than me. Tis a shame, I can't like a man younger than 10 years older than me...

      I'm such a slacker, I skipped class today and I skipped my required radio station meeting. The two classes I DID go to I was about ten minutes late to...I can't help it if i'm sick though and it is raining outside that really cold rain that seeps into your bones and no matter what you can't get warm. I just wanted to snuggle under my covers all evening. I actually got to for awhile after FINALLY getting a hold of my parents. I didn't want to tell them what they are getting for Christmas, but they are no fun to shop for because I have no clue what they do or do not have in music. I wanted to know if they had bought the Led Zeppelin set "How the West was Won" which they haven't, which makes my life a whole lot easier...I am such a kid when it comes to Christmas, I start counting down that holiday about 2 months before it gets here. In fact, I often skip entirely over my birthday...(by the way, I really would like a space twins tshirt or some hello kitty stuff this year-*hint*hint*) So I pretty much have all my holiday shopping done which is awesome, so I won't be all freaking out about what I'm going to get everyone when the time comes. Why wait until the day after Thanksgiving? That is fucking crazy! I hope my friends like their presents, I get so excited giving everyone their presents, I love to see the look on their faces when they open them. Oh, speaking of holidays, someone used the term "turkey day" around me yesterday and I was like "I don't eat turkey, i prefer to call it cranberry day or pumpkin pie day" Isn't that the best part of Thanksgiving anyway? Personally, even when I ate meat, I still got the most excited about the cranberries or the pumpkin pie...mmmmm with cool whip.........okay, getting a little too excited over food, heehee.  So over the weekend Becca came up and we went to see School of Rock with Jack Black. That movie was FUCKING AWESOME. It rekindled my love for the red Gibson SG and made me want to be a rock star all over again. If I wasn't so sick and my guitar didn't need new strings I'd try writing a song or something with the whole three chords that I know (C, G, and D I believe...) Hey, it's possible! Man though, if you haven't seen that movie yet, SEE IT! It does not disappoint...Speaking of music, I wish I could see Matt Sharp with Tegan and Sara....*cries*

      I think Becca is mad at me. Last night I told her that I had biked home from the video shoot a couple weeks ago at 3 a.m. and she got really pissed off at me. She even signed offline before I had a chance to say goodnight. Okay, maybe biking home or walking home that late on a Thursday night is not completely safe, but if the guys I work with thought it was that dangerous, I KNOW they wouldn't let me walk/bike home. Plus, I'm not the only one who does that, one of the girls walks back to the Towers alone and she's a freshman. I believe she's more at risk than I am. Still, I don't plan on doing it again if it upsets Becca THAT much. I guess I'm more of a vulnerable person because I'm small and a female. It sucks that I can't even go anywhere by myself because some creep might want to hurt me. This world is so cruel sometimes, I can't handle it. Why do some men feel they have to prey off of the fact that most of them are bigger and stronger than women? I'm sure that was not the reason God created women. It just isn't fair.  Anyway, I'm so glad this week is almost over. I got most of the really shitty stuff done this week like that three hour telephone interview on Tuesday, my taped interview for my audio production class, and my philosophy and chemistry tests (I seriously think I aced the chem test, I didn't even have to study for it). All i have to worry about for next week is editing the audio project and finishing a sociology paper that is due Friday. I'll try to get some of that done this weekend, but knowing me I'll just lay around the apartment and talk to myself since I believe my roommates will be gone. Oh, but there is one thing I MUST do tomorrow and that is send my resumes out for an internship. Now that October is more than halfway over, now is definitely the time to be looking for one. I really really really really hope I get one at one of the major record labels that are looking for publicity interns. Although I don't particularly want to work for a major label, it would be cool to have that internship because then I could possibly get a job doing publicity for an independent label...I guess I'll have to see. So I guess this weekend should be pretty relaxing, I think maybe I'll try doing a little painting or maybe finish the book I've been trying to read since August, and I'm just getting to the good part of the story...(for it being a victorian novel, it's pretty interesting) Oh, and I also get to listen to all those cds for the radio station to pick out next week's playlist, I got a really good mix this week, it should be fun listening to. Man, I love my job at the radio station! What would make it even better is getting PAID to listen to all this music...

      Okay, the semester is now officially halfway over!!! I want this semester to be just done with already, California can't come soon enough...Anyway, today Becca dropped by to visit for a couple of hours, I was happy, I miss hanging out with her, even if it is only for a short time. So anyway, after that I got my hair cut, even though It was a half-hour walk to Grondin's. Thinking back, I should have gone to BoRics but it didn't cross my mind at all. Oh well, I took a chance in cutting my hair up in a bob, which I haven't had it like this since I was about 12 years old. Thank god, it turned out cute, at least I think it did. I kinda look like Amelie, so that is good, since Amelie is one of my favorite movies, I can relate to that character in too many ways. Anyhow, I'm just sitting here now listening to the Smiths, yet i'm not depressed. I just got done watching this weird pseudo-erotic spanish film and one of the characters looked creepily like Matt Sharp. I felt so dirty for watching it because well, it just felt so WRONG. Damn dirty foreign films...  Okay, my roommate Christy is such an airhead and I just have to say that. She ordered a pizza earlier and just left before it even got here! Thankfully the pizza guy knew her so he just dropped the pizza off because I was not about to pay for it. To top it off, her friend just walks into my apartment earlier after my other two roommates left and about scared the shit out of me. Okay, I admit I should have had my front door locked, but I thought maybe Liz locked the door when she left. I guess I'll just have to be more careful next time. Still though, who the hell just walks into an apartment that isn't theirs without knocking??? It is scary that some of these people that go to college here are going to be living on their own within the next few years... I wonder, if Joan of Arc lived during the 14th century or whenever how could she have had a walkman that melted when she was burned at the stake? (a confusing smiths lyric that just stumps me every time i hear it)

      So, today is my mommy's birthday. She turned 44 today (yeah, I have young parents). I was going to call her to wish her happy birthday but she probably would have told me to fuck off or something like that and plus I fell asleep around 6:30 or something after reading this victorian novel I've been trying to read for the past two months. It's called "Lady Audley's Secret", it isn't boring at all, it is kinda like a mystery but it's about 400 pages long and I don't get the chance to read for pleasure very much. Most of the time I'm reading shit like audio production. Speaking of audio production, I took my midterm for that class today. It wasn't even half as bad as I thought it would be, but I still doubt I got an A on it. More than likely I got something in the B range which is just fine with me, all i'm really concerned with is passing the class. So the rest of this week looks really boring but next week is just going to Suck with a capital S. I have a philosophy test on Tuesday, a three hour appointment to conduct telephone interviews for my research class, a chemistry test on thursday and another taping at Rubbles for "The Tour" (9 hours) on Thursday night. All I can say is next weekend I'm going to sleep the whole time. Oh yeah, and I have another interview I have to conduct as well next week too, but that will only be like 20 minutes, so I'm not too concerned with that. I'm gonna say this again, I really really really really want this semester to be over with. Considering this week is midterms week, it is already halfway over. Only three more weeks of October and pretty much the month of November. I don't generally count December because after Thanksgiving there is one more week of classes, then exam week. Considering the first half of the semester has flown by insanely fast, I'm pretty sure the second half will go by really quick. It always seems as if first semester goes by much quicker than second semester. Of course next semester I won't be officially taking any classes nor will I be anywhere remotely NEAR this campus I'll probably forget that I'm still technically in college until May.  Well enough about school, let's talk politics. So I wonder what it will be like living in a state now where the governor is the Terminator himself. Okay, I think Arnold is pretty cool and all but I just can't see him as being governor, I can't believe the people of California recalled Grey Davis. I might not be that familiar with California's state politics, but I'm sure he knows more about running the state than a hollywood actor does. I suppose I should give him more of a chance, but he's gonna have to prove himself or else I'm gonna be one of those people who tries to vote him out of office at the next gubernatorial election.  Okay, enough political talk, I'm really bored and I should end this here since I've exhausted every interesting topic I could talk about. On that note, I just got a craving for a latte with triple shot espresso....I really hope I get that cappucino/espresso maker for my birthday! Mmmm...foam...

      Soo...I was going to go to the library to do my mega internship search, but it is really really really shitty outside, so I guess I'll hang up that idea. *Sigh* I suppose that means I have to read audio production today. Oh well, I really need to catch up on that for the midterm anyway. So, the past few days have been quite interesting, I saw the first snow of the year on Wednesday, which made me depressed because first, I hate snow and second, it is probably the last time I will see the first snow of the year because I'm moving out of Michigan in three months. THREE MONTHS!!!!! God, I can't believe that much time has passed since I decided to move out west. I remember counting down from 9 months, and now I'm down to 3....creepy creepy creepy. I also can't believe midterms are already here, and I'm over halfway done with my BCA practicum hours. I am now up to 28.5 hours and I only  need 45 hours. Speaking of that, last night was very very interesting indeed. I think from now on I'm going to be stuck on camera 2 since I was so good apparently that my producer, PK, pulled me aside at the end of the night to tell me how great I made the show and what a kick ass job I did. I guess I just was really bored and had to get all artistic on their asses. I'd like do these artistic close ups of the hi-hat (I don't know if I spelled that right) or I'd do like a slow zoom out from the mandolin player (whose name was Brian by the way, since I kept calling him the guy in the red shirt) to his hands playing the instrument. Okay, I'm getting into broadcasting lingo, I'll stop it now. So anyway, it was quite funny because the producers and directors in the van which is where they do all the technical stuff for the show, were so completely TRASHED it wasn't even funny. It is interesting taking orders from a plastered director...quite an interesting night indeed. Needless to say, PK said no one is allowed to have any more alcohol at our tapings again. This doesn't really matter I suppose, because we have only two more tapings. Speaking of Rubbles, I would love to go tonight because Knee Deep Shag is playing there tonight...oh well, I'm broke and I have no car...So one more thing I have to say that made me happy even though it sounds incredibly nerdy but my rank changed again at the Space Twins messageboards. I'm now no longer a "Forum Goddess" but instead I am "Goddess of Love"! I was laughing so hard last night when I saw that, but it made me happy =) Okay, I'm going to go back and be even more nerdy now and study for my midterm on wednesday...

      So it's thanksgiving time again....and my birthday is Monday! WOOOOO!!!!! I'll be 23 =) Not that that is a special age or anything, I just love birthdays....and I get to spend my birthday in Southern California this year, so that will definitely rock. I've never spent my birthday anywhere but in Michigan, so this is definitely a first. I also have that interview next Tuesday and I really, really, really, really, really hope I get that internship!!!! *crosses fingers* Okay, breathe Jenny..... Well, I pretty much got everything done except one paper which I decided I'm just going to turn in late, it's a really short paper and I just don't have the energy to write any more papers, I will just have a few points taken off, that's all... Anyway, I hope my birthday is good and I'll see everyone next week! (I'm gonna miss Becca and Justin though...*tear*)

      This is going to show up as the same date as my last post, but it is actually much later, like 10 hours later....I would like to apologize to Miss Becca for sounding like such a bitch if she happens to read this. I think I have pms or something and on top of that am stressed out about everything like I've been like for some time. It is so rainy outside....so I'm in the library instead of back at my apartment eating a grilled cheese with that nice block cheese Becca gave me. Oh well, I can have one after business ethics. Maybe I'll eat some vegetable or lentil soup with it....I'm jealous, Justin's boyfriend Sanyo can grill tofu, I tried the other day but it looked more like an omelette with a bunch of rice, vegetables and soy sauce dumped on top. I don't think vegetarian stir fries are supposed to look like that....I really have to meet Sanyo, he is such a cutie, Justin sent me a picture yesterday, I just wanna give him a lollipop he's so adorable.  I think I might have another interview...*crosses fingers* I got another email and the woman I sent my cover letter to asked me if I was looking for an internship before or after graduation. I think I gave her the right answer....I hope at least. I will know later if she answers my email. What is ironic is that it was not one of the places that I expected to get an answer from. I sent out about 10 cover letters and copies of my resume yesterday. What would be really funny is if I got replies to all of them. I doubt that will happen though. I just want some security in case I don't get the one at Amy Levy PR, that is the jewel, the one I REALLY want. Come on, Art Galleries and Gourmet Restaurants? That is TOTALLY Jenny!  Ooh, the song "Blood Roses" by Tori has organ in it, it makes me think of Nick...why am I still obsessed with him? I can't help it, men who know how to use their hands (and feet) is such a turn on. Oh, and if they are a sax player that is even better because they know how to use their mouth...*wink* I would like to thank Davey for sending me a nice sweet long e-mail, he almost made me cry it was so sweet. Jen is such a lucky girl, although I'm sure I could not think of Davey in a romantic way because I've come to know him in such a platonic way (sorry Davey if you are reading this, I still think you're cute though ^^) Anyway, I'm glad Davey made me smile and said I had a cute smile, it made me feel pretty.  Okay, before I tire out every possible topic, I'm reading this novel right now called "The Virgin's Knot." It is about this famed weaver in Turkey, she has polio. Well she weaves dowry rugs for brides, obviously. She is believed to have healing powers within her rugs, the grace of Allah, I believe. (well, Turkey is a muslim nation). Anyway she is really lonely and doesn't want to continue with her calling, and begins to question why she isn't allowed to marry. I haven't got further than that part so I'm not sure if she actually gets to fall in love or marry. This has rekindled my fascination with Muslim culture. I used to have many muslim friends I would talk to online, but they would always try to bring up the topic of September 11th, (not always in an anti-american way either, they were just as devastated) but I always felt strange talking about it because one girl from the UAE didn't think that Osama Bin Laden did anything wrong, or that he was even involved in the 9-11 attacks, which of course I disagreed with. Whenever the topic came up I would change the subject, because I did not want to impose my American views on her. However, I did learn that most muslim people are very understanding and kind people. They are also more devoted to their religion and are very philanthropic. They are ALWAYS trying to help out others, and they don't expect any rewards in return. They do this to please Allah. I really don't like how people try to make judgements on people they know little to nothing at all about. It was not the muslim people that attacked us, many were radicals, just like there are radical christians in our own country. I did have trouble talking to many of the muslim male friends of mine though, because many wanted to marry me and had an interesting view of what american females were like. They didn't understand that I want to marry someone I love, I can't love someone I haven't met or known in some way over a period of time. To get back on topic, people need to educate themselves on something before they can make judgements on them. Americans don't do that, because we think we know it all and that we can do no wrong. That is fucking bullshit. We are the fools for the rest of the world. Everyone else is laughing at us and I think we deserve it. No, we don't deserve to be terrorized or anything that harms innocent people but we need to stop pulling our weight around and thinking the way we live is the only right way. I can say right now, I'd rather be european, they aren't as self righteous and hypocritical as Americans. Yes, from now on I think I'm gonna be a European, or maybe just an alien, that's much better.  On one last note, it would be bad form to ask for the Koran for a Christmas present so I can learn more about the muslim faith so perhaps I will check it out at the library and read it during the holy month of Ramadan?

      Before I go to bed, I thought I would write in here. So anyway Becca's all pissed at me because I happen to get my feelings hurt when I'm reminded how my best friend who is almost a fucking year younger than me has to point out that she is more grown up than me because she is in the working world and here I am still stuck in college and I have it sooooooooo made. She obviously forgot how much college sucks. Okay, she didn't directly say any of that, but that is how I took it. I HATE being patronized and I hate being reminded how I'm stuck in college and I don't want to be here. She may not realize it but she probably really does think she's more grown up than me just because she's working and stuff, living like an adult and all. I'm happy she has a job but I HATE it when people accuse me of glamorizing the working world when I never did. I hate it even more when someone says "You'll understand when you get a job, it isn't all fun and games." If i wanted to hear that I could just go home and listen to my parents for five minutes. It really hurts my feelings and makes me feel like a baby. I don't need to be reminded even more what a failure in life I am. So maybe the rest of the world doesn't care that I was a year behind in school and most don't even realize it. So maybe there are plenty of 23 year olds still in college. They also graduated high school in 99 or took a year off or whatever. I DIDN'T. I was still in fucking high school until i was nearly 20. That isn't what bothers me though. Maybe it bothers me that there are 21 year olds out there graduating and shit and here I am still stuck in school. I'd feel like this still even if I had been in the right grade in high school and had just been in college for say five years instead of four. I hate feeling like a child and I HATE it, I mean REALLY hate it when people say "you'd understand if..." It was like before I had ever had a boyfriend or been kissed or whatever when people would say "You'll understand when you get a boyfriend." I know Becca wouldn't appreciate that if I ever said that to her. Just like she is sensitive about not having a boyfriend or romantic experiences I'm sensitive about people making me feel stupid or immature. Okay, I think I got most of this out of my system, I think I'm just going to go read because that is the only thing that makes me feel intelligent and not a loser who has some naive outlook on the world because she is stuck in some pseudo reality while people are out there with real jobs and Jenny is just some dumbass who will get a big slap in the face when she encounters the big scary world out there after college. (no shit, I already know that).

      Okay, I totally freaked out last night and feel so much better. I have just chilled out and read, slept, watched television and listened to music and am thinking a lot clearer now. Deep down I know things will work out fine. I looked at my portfolio today and realized just how impressive it looks, and that takes a lot for me to say that about my own work. I am still going to send out more cover letters. I always seem to get like this at the end of a semester, it never fails. It always goes away though, almost as quickly as it appears. This is funny, I'm watching like some UK music awards or something on CBC (Canadian TV) and there are these guys with the cutest scottish accents. I want to just take them home with me! And I also have to mention that it is really cool that Eminem thanks everyone who hates him for winning the best hip hop award. I don't like his music, but the guy has major attitude. Okay, gotta go, watching The Chemical Brothers perform with the Flaming Lips... (Wayne Coyne is my hero)

      I am so fucking sick of college. I want OUT. I may not feel this way at this time next year, but I just want to be out of Michigan and no longer have to worry about grades, and degree requirements and all that bullshit. Here I am driving myself crazy because I need a fucking internship, and so far I have only received ONE reply, so I only have ONE interview! I can't depend on that ONE interview, what If for some reason I don't get the job? I hope they take more than one intern, because the way things are looking, if I don't get any more replies, I wasted almost 500 fucking dollars to go on a trip to Los Angeles I didn't even want to take. Don't get me wrong, I like L.A., but I could have used that money on more constructive things. This sucks so much, if it wasn't for this internship requirement, I'd be graduating in a month, and I wouldn't have to worry about this, I could concentrate all my energies on getting a REAL job and making REAL money. I'm almost 23 for crying out loud and there are college grads younger than me out there! Here I am still living like a stupid college kid. I FUCKING HATE THIS!!!!

      "Some bad news. Matt Sharps moog synthesizer "The Source" among other things went missing in montreal. If anyone knows anything about it please contact this number: 1-917-488-3708 and ask for Michael Ringer or you can email him at: michaeltringer@hotmail.com" - This just in from MattSharp.net, poor guy, he is probably freaking out, I hope someone finds it so Matt can be one with his Moog again... Okay, that was all I really wanted to say, trying not to fret about the pending cross-country move to SoCal, or the apartment I haven't rented yet, or the fact that I still only have ONE interview scheduled for an internship I HAVE to have to graduate....*BREATHE JENNY* Okay, Jenny is going to have some chocolate pudding and then take a nap...

      Man, I love the feeling of being stoked about new music. I got two Tegan and Sara cds last night, "If it was you" and "This business of art" and I must say, I'm just blown away by these girls' talent. I've been listening to "If it was you" non-stop. If I had to pick a favorite song, I wouldn't be able to, the cd is excellent. As for other things, I guess I will be going to Cali in less than a month to do a job(internship) interview, thus missing the last week of classes. How ironic, that my very last college class will end BEFORE Thanksgiving! Alas, I have a feeling it won't be the last, because there is always the chance I may decide to go to grad school one of these days...but at CMU it will be my last class....Yeah, I was stoked to find out I had an interview for an internship at a PR firm in West Los Angeles near Santa Monica. Now all i have to do is not get my hopes up too high OR be too negative about it. The best I will have to do is try to show myself in the best possible light so that I will get hired. Hopefully there will be a few more people out there who will like to interview me too...Man, I just hate all this stress that comes with moving to California in LESS THAN TWO MONTHS!!! EEP! Anyway, I think I've stressed myself out to the max, so now i'm extremely calm about everything, which I think is good. Maybe it is those new cds I got- Thank you Tegan and Sara! =)

      GUESS WHOSE BIRTHDAY IT IS TODAY??? One of my favorite men in the world, that is.....Mr. Brian Bell from the Space Twins! Oh yes, and he's Weezer's rhythm guitarist too...He turns 35 today! I love fellow Saggittarians but what makes him even more special is he is like the male version of myself, or at least that is what some close friends of mine say. Now, I can't claim to know much about him, so I'm not going to go through every last creepy similarity I share with the man. I just want to honor him on his day of birth and how much I admire him. When I was all depressed about breaking up with my asshole of an ex boyfriend, I went to a Weezer show and noticed how happy Brian was and he smiled at me and made me feel so much better. Since then I've had this obsession with him (in a healthy yet cute little girl sense, not in a creepy stalker type way). I think he is so amazingly talented and can't even fathom how he does it. My God, how many instruments can that man play? I get so mad when people say he's gay. Even if he was, why should people care? All that matters is he's happy and he's doing what he loves and is great at it. Just because he looks or acts a certain way doesn't mean shit. That is why I feel guilty assuming that he is a certain way, because I don't really know him, so I really can't say he is like this or he's like that. Although the assumptions I do make are positive ones, but it is still dangerous to generalize. People do that to me, and in turn, everyone thinks I'm either extremely childish, stupid or just a flake. Okay, maybe some of that is true, but I'm not stupid....Anyway, I could go on forever talking about how attractive Brian is but that is not what I love so much about him. He has this charm about him that he probably isn't even aware of. He always has such a dreamy expression on his face, and I wonder what is on his mind. He's looked so sad lately, it just hurts to see him look like that, even though it shouldn't. I would really love to meet him but am afraid that I will be just another fan to him...I don't want him to think I'm just some crazy pathetic girl who knit him a chenille scarf one summer because she was lonley and wanted to make him smile or sent sketches to his sister in exchange for some awesome poster art. I guess overall, I'm just a lonely girl and he makes me smile. If a person really knows me, they know that these crazy things I do are just crazy things I'd do for anyone. If I at any point I freaked out Brian or Leia, I'm sorry. Anyway, I don't want to sound so sad, today is a happy day. I hope that one day I can get to know Brian, even if it is just shyly admiring him from across a crowded street, pretending that he is flattered by this quiet girl who loves him from afar...

      Ooh, goody, now I get to talk about being 23 and my fun filled trip to los ciudad de los angeles...heehee(not really). I am back in Michigan and already miss the palm trees, warm weather and flaky people. California people are so much fun, they are like all little children, they are like on another planet or something. It will be a great place to write flaky novels about how weird L.A. is. It is the third time I've been there and it gets more interesting every time. I pretty much had the interview from hell with that place that I originally wanted to intern for. The lady was such a bitch, and tried to tell me that "hierarchal" was not a word and didn't know where Temecula was. Geeze, so maybe Temecula isn't a huge area, but I'd think someone who lived in L.A. would know where it is. To top it off, this chick was SOOOO NYC, she even kept a clock in her office with EST time on it. Talk about being attached to your home...the worst part was that she kept patronizing me and when at the end she hadn't told me a definite yes or no she was like "you didn't expect to get an answer after only one interview did you?" That was so fucking rude, and I was like "no, but I kind of need an answer so I can apply to get credit for this internship..." So needless to say I was pretty upset after that. Thank God I had a couple more interviews and as luck would  have it was late to the one on wednesday night, which was in Beverly Hills and got really really pissed off at my cousin because she was the reason I was late and had to reschedule an interview. So when I thought things couldn't get any worse, thursday it was up to me to drive up to Sherman Oaks from Anaheim to do an interview for this music publicity firm. So I was so rushed on Thursday thinking I was going to get swamped by L.A. traffic and couldn't get my cousin's apartment door locked so I just kind of slammed it shut really hard, and didn't have time to shower or even brush my teeth. So I figured I was pretty much screwed anyway, and of course, I was an hour early to this interview, and pretty much bummed around Ventura Blvd. for an hour and was still early to the interview. This woman, who had a cute little alliteral name, her name was Penny P. didn't even bother to look at my portfolio, she just looked at my resume and pretty much told me I was perfect for the job. I was seriously in shock that whole way home that I missed the 101 freeway and wound up driving around until I somehow wound up on Sunset. Since I finally knew where I was by that point, I took the 405 back and go figure my cousin's car totally craps out and wouldn't shift past second gear and I had to coast at 30 all the way back to her apartment! (I was off the 405 by then) However, this trip wasn't all bad, I got sang to at the Old Spaghetti Factory on sunday, which was thorougly embarassing and probably about the third of fourth time that's happened to me in my life on my birthday, went apartment hunting and still don't have an apartment and managed to have every one of my cousin's friends (minus her roommate Brian) flirt with me...Not that that matters, because I am almost always completely unresponsive to flirting unless I take an interest in the guy myself...I guess that is why I sometimes get called "an ice queen" or on occasion a "tease." I don't mean to, I'm just really weird when it comes to relationships...maybe someone out there will help me stop doing that. Okay, enough talking about my fucked up love life, tis exam week this week and the last time I'll have to deal with these, cuz I'm done taking college classes! YAY!!!!

      I am so exhausted. I did sooooo much this weekend and I feel so accomplished! I went totally nuts and disinfected all the sinks/counters, swept and mopped the kitchen floor, cleaned the toilet...and the apartment is STILL messy. Good news though, Becca's parents are total darlings and are getting us a refrigerator. Yes, we're THAT poor, we have been using a mini cube fridge that doesn't hold shit. Of course once we have our new refrigerator we can use it as a beer cooler for when we actually have money to buy alcohol, not that we ever drink.... I think I'm turning into a TV addict- normally I almost never watch TV, I listen mostly to my cds. I also don't listen to the radio, I'm a shame to the Broadcasting department at CMU...anyway, I realized I never miss an episode of America's Next Top Model, King of the Hill, Arrested Development, Wonderfalls....I haven't watched that much television since I was in elementary school! It's weird how I've regressed back to that again.  I so wish I had intelligent stuff to write in here, but right now I'm trying to look busy in this office even though it's technically lunch time for everyone...I can't wait till this internship is over. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy doing music publicity but I just wanna get my damn bachelor's degree so I can start making some money and feel like my work isn't entirely thankless. Anyway, enough of my bitching, there has to be something positive to talk about...Ahh, summer sounds so nice, it will be nice once I feel like my life is back to normal again. Moving really messed up the flow of my life now it's all royally fucked up. It would be nice to actually go out and meet people. Perhaps meet some cool fella and start a nice relationship with lots of good conversation, companionship and great sex....yeah, I'll think of that for the rest of the day, that sounds like a wonderful idea...

      I just realized that my "co-workers" at my internship probably think I'm anorexic or something. I never take lunches and Penny even offered to buy me lunch today and I declined. I didn't want to explain that I have odd eating habits and suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and this effects my eating and sleeping patterns and makes me feel sick frequently. I hope I'm not a workaholic either...it is just that I don't want to explain how I'm a vegetarian and feel odd just leaving the office to get food, or spend money I don't really have on lunch...I usually just eat when I get home, which I know is not good. I'll feel much better when I have some income so I don't have to feel guilty for spending money on food. I have faith though, more faith than I should that money won't always be a problem, it just is right now. Okay, enough of me getting aggitated over how stressful my life is right now.  Can't think of anything else to type at the moment. I'm extremely bored, maybe I'll go listen to one of the cds I brought with me to work- like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, they rock.

      OH WOW! I haven't written in here in about 3 months, well it's about time I got back to doing this again. Yes, as anyone probably reading this knows I actually made it to California in one piece and am now living in peace (sort of) on the border of Glendale, California near the cute little neighborhoods of Silverlake, Atwater Village and Los Feliz in Los Angeles. What is a shame is I really have nothing to write about, I don't have a paid job right now, I intern for a music publicity company who represents David Bowie, Alanis Morrissette, Matchbox 20, The Living End, Korn, A Perfect Circle...I guess that makes me cool, right? I don't feel cool... I still feel very single and very broke. But I'm happy. I finally had the chance to chat with my old pal Miranda a few times today through e-mail and talk about her kids, Alicia (3) and Seth (almost 2). Damn, I talk to all these girls around my age who have babies and it makes me want to be a mother! Grrr... I am so shy though and meeting men for me is so HARD. Sure, I think a lot of guys find me attractive but I haven't met a guy with whom I feel that SPARK. Maybe it is because I'm so out there that I scare men away...or because I'm only attracted to older men and everyone thinks i'm only 17 when I'm actually 23...or maybe because I'm hoping for a man I can never have.

      Funny how things can change so drastically between two days. Yesterday was seriously one of the best days I'd had in a long time. I got this really cool package of art in the mail and one of the pieces was of someone whom I greatly care for and respect...as much as I can for not knowing him. It is so special to me though, I even framed it, because I'm such a dork. On top of that, I actually found a place that seems interested in hiring me. It is just a bed, bath and beyond, but I'm obsessed with that store. I seriously don't have the energy to try to look for a job with my degree when I finally get it (hopefully) in a few weeks. Plus, MSO mentioned hiring me part time for the summer, so I have to see if that is going to actually happen.  Okay, so today, I have two bombs dropped on me. Now, the first one is so petty and dumb and it shouldn't bother me but it does. I find out that this above person who was the subject of that treasured piece of art has a girlfriend. I think It was one he had previously...if that is the case...I don't know how I feel about that, I get this feeling that she was way too controlling over him and I can't have much respect for that. However, If he is happy, that is all that matters and it isn't as if I ever stood a chance in hell of EVER being the object of his affection considering I've never met him. Now, if that had been the only thing that I had had to deal with today, I would have been able to bottle it up and pretend it didn't bother me, ignore the fact that probably within 15 miles of my home, somewhere some woman is sharing coffee and a bedroom with him while I shiver in my apartment wishing someone found me desirable enough for a long term relationship. It is pretty sad, I'm a 23 year old virgin and that isn't even by choice. I've had only ONE boyfriend and that was for a whole whopping 4 months and he dumped me because he couldn't stay in love with me. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME??? I don't want to be alone; I want to find a man who I feel will understand me. I thought I had figured out who that was, but apparently some other woman has the honor of being with him... Okay, that isn't the only thing that broke my heart- my best friend, of 8 years, decided that he doesn't want to be friends with me anymore. He just flat out gave up on me. I deserted him for my other friend, apparently, to move 3,000 miles away. I wasn't angry. I just went to the bathroom and cried and felt my heart finish breaking. If he doesn't want to try to maintain a friendship that means the world to me, then apparently I'm not worth loving.  I don't know what to do, I'm sick of people hurting me all the time. I feel so alone here. I miss being held, I miss being kissed. I want to feel the way I feel when I think of this unnamed person whom I cannot have because another woman has God's grace to share his life. I want someone REAL, someone who thinks about me and smiles, someone who knows what I'm going to say before I say it. Someone who understands me.  Apparently I will never have it though.

      I didn't realize that people could read my blogs, but I guess that's what I get for posting the link to it on The Space Twins message boards...Oh well, I have nothing to hide from anyone. Plus, I've got so much support when I was all depressed about a month ago. However, things have been looking up lately. I FINALLY graduated from college with a bachelor of applied arts degree in Integrative Public Relations with a minor in Broadcast and Cinematic Arts. WOW! That's a mouthful. Also, my internship ends this week and I recently got a job at Bed, Bath and Beyond in Encino. Yes, I am a housewares whore. I LOVE lamps, china, stemware, and those really nice vornado fans that blow in my face all afternoon...so cold, but they feel oh so nice...too bad they're $90...but I do get a 20% discount! Okay, enough of that- I'm considering getting a second job on top of that for the summer, I saw a listing for a paid internship assisting a fashion publicist in North Hollywood, so I'm thinking I'll send them a cover letter with my resume. It's worth a shot, but if they don't seem interested in me, oh well, not a big deal. I'm just glad to finally be out of Michigan for good, and realized when I went back to visit a few days ago that I don't really miss it. I guess L.A. kind of corrupted me to the city life because I was so BORED when I was in Clarkston! I don't know how I ever survived going to college for four years in such a boring place such as Mount Pleasant (which is worse than Clarkston). Well, I wish I had something more clever to say now, but alas, I have nothing. Mayhaps I will go read a little "Interview With The Vampire" about now...

Okay, despite some of the anime quizzes I've posted on here, I wouldn't consider myself a "fangirl" like in anime culture. However, I do have this growing addiction to manga, the graphic novels that many anime are based from. I think this is partially because I have such an appreciation for the art and also the storylines, which tend to be much deeper than most American stories, especially American Comics. Don't get me wrong, there are some deeper meanings in American comics such as The Incredible Hulk and Spiderman, but as a whole, they just aren't as deep as Japanese Manga. The funny thing is, I don't really watch the anime counterparts of these manga- but maybe that is because I'm not much of a tv watcher and it for some reason can't hold my attention for very long, whereas reading a book can. Anyway, I have Becca and my brother Jason to thank for my growing addiction to manga. I have a growing collection in my closetful of books, my favorite which is this series called "Paradise Kiss" which is this story of this interesting group of fashion students who kidnap this prep-school girl so that she can model in their upcoming fashion show. The tranny, Isabella in there is actually one of the best looking women I've seen done in ink. It took me a minute to realize it was really a man...I just loved fucked up literature! As for right now, I'm reading this series my brother gave me (the entire collection) called "Chobits" about this Artificial Intelligence this boy finds. Of course, it is kind of dirty, but I'm not going to complain about that...even though I really don't have a thing about seeing naked anime girls... To change the subject...maybe I'll change the spelling of my name- like Jenypher? Yeah, that's fucked up I know but I love it!

      Confucious a very wise man indeed...Jenny definitely has no patience. I know that I shouldn't worry about not having a full time job yet, but it is so fucking frustrating. I am barely surviving on not even 30 hours a week at 9/hr pay. I can't even afford new panties! It is really depressing. What pisses me off even more is Becca can't even have any sympathy, she just gets all pissy and goes to her room ignoring the problem. She's obviously forgotten what she went through just a few months ago. I guess I have no one who understands me. It isn't that I'm expecting someone to just offer me a job within a week, but barely anyone is even biting because I have no goddamn office experience. It's a fucking joke. Why did I fucking go to college for four fucking years if I have to deal with this shit? GRRRRR!!!!! Also I'm limited on where I can work because I have no fucking car, but I can't get a car until I get a fucking job! To top it off, the job opportunities right now just plain SUCK. I know it'll get better, but again, I have that little problem with patience...Until I can get a full time job with semi-decent pay I can't even get a fucking car, and I really really really want a car...I can't even think straight whenever I worry about money. I hate the damn stuff, I wish we just bartered like way back when, but knowing my damn luck, I'd get the short end of the stick there too...

      Nothing too exciting to report today other than the fact that I have another job interview for tomorrow...hopefully not another hellish one from yesterday, if that is possible...*knocks on wood*  I was thinking earlier in the car about how I have favorite lines from songs that I listen to, so out of sheer boredom, I thought I'd list them. Here goes:   My windows look into your bathroom, and I spend the evening watch you get yourself clean; I wonder why it is they left this bathroom so unclean, so unlike me  -Tegan and Sara "Living Room"   we're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully pretty! oh you know that i'd do anything for you... we should have each other to tea huh? we should have each other with cream then curl up in the fire and sleep for awhile it's the grooviest thing it's the perfect dream  -The Cure "The Lovecats"   The wooly mammoth's my favorite mammal, he's got more sperm than a sperm whale  -The Space Twins "A Brief History   When the night's moon lights up a bright room, I watch you when lunar eclipses come up from the skies above, oh come with me goddess of love.  -The Space Twins "Goddess of Love"   If the man is five, if man is five, if man is five then the devil is six, the devil is six, the devil is six, the devil is six, the devil is six and if the devil is six then God is seven, god is seven god is seven...  -The Pixies "Monkey Gone to Heaven"   I hope you know this will go down  on your permanent record oh yeah well don't get so distressed  did I happen to mention that I'm impressed  -The Violent Femmes "Kiss Off"   I said I don't live in Chicago I don't know no Al Capone that bitch took my money  and went to Chicago if I ain't already enough  sick and alone  -The Violent Femmes "To The Kill"   And if a double-decker bus  Crashes into us  To die by your side  Is such a heavenly way to die  And if a ten-ton truck  Kills the both of us  To die by your side  Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine   -The Smiths "There is a Light That Never Goes Out"   If Everyone's a Little queer, can't she be a little straight?  -Weezer "Pink Triangle"   I asked you to go to the Green Day concert  You said you never heard of them  -How cool is that?-  So I went to your room and read your diary:  "watching Grunge leg-drop New-Jack through a press table..."  and then my heart stopped:  "listening to Cio-Cio San."  fall in love all over again  -Weezer "El Scorcho"   Now, I return to your place  Knocking trying to get in  And your roommate opens the door  And says Why are you back here again?  I put my things down in the hall  Quietly enter your room  You're sound asleep with the cats  As I climb back in bed with you   -The Rentals "Overlee"   Are you gonna live your life wonderin’ standing in the back lookin’ around? Are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you’ve grown up or how you missed out? Things are never gonna be the way you want. Where's it gonna get you acting serious? Things are never gonna be quite what you want. Or even at 25, you gotta start sometime. I’m on my feet, I’m on the floor, I’m good to go. Now all I need is just to hear a song I know. I wanna always feel like part of this was mine. I wanna fall in love tonight.  -Jimmy Eat World "Praise Chorus"   right on time you get closer and closer called my name but there's no way in use that fame rent your wife and kids today maybe she will maybe she will caught a lite sneeze dreamed a little dream made my own pretty hate machine boys on my left side boys on my right side boys in the middle and you're not here boys in their dresses and you're not here I need a big loan from the girl zone  -Tori Amos "Caught A Light Sneeze"   The soul-quake happened here in a glass world. Particle by particle she slowly changes. She likes hanging Chinese paper cuts. Just another fix... can I weather this?  -Tori Amos "Concertina"   You're feeling instead of being The more that I live on the inside There's nothing to give I'm infatuated by your moves I've got to search hard for your clues  -Badly Drawn Boy "Once Around the Block"   I think I'm drowning asphyxiating I wanna break the spell that you've created   -Muse "Time is Running Out"   I want to thank the industrialization for the noises it gave Thanks for the planes and thanks for the trains  And for the factories that you've made Do you remember when it was quiet down here?  -The(International)Noise Conspiracy "Will it ever be quiet?"      I'd like to dedicate that last lyric to Wes, my ex-boyfriend from 3 years ago who opened my eyes to the music of socialism and realizing that is really the only thing that rocks about being socialist-Really good punk bands!

      So I got this annoying email for the millionth time from the place I used to keep my old online journal: my-diary.org. However, there were only 7 entries I did from last summer so I thought I would post my old entries in here and delete my inactive account there. Bear with me, this is all going to be dated for today, but it should make for some rather entertaining reading material...   6/25/03 My First Entry- Matt Sharp Concert   So....This is my first entry here, but being that it is  2:14 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, I think I will just talk a  little about the Matt Sharp concert I went to in Hamtramck  last night and think of something more brilliant to say  later...  So, yesterday was Becca's birthday present from me, the  Matt Sharp concert in Hamtramck, MI at Small's. Although  Hamtramck is really really ghetto, there were some pretty  memorable moments from this concert. I've decided that  Small's is a really shitty venue to go to, especially in  the summer when the little room is sweltering, even when  people are spread out. Also, I'm not surprised that I saw  my ex-boyfriend there who of course as luck would have  it,wae  sitting on the other side of Becca, but it didn't bother me  for some reason. Perhaps I was too hot, too mellowed out  from my beer to care, or maybe it was that creepy spitting  image of Brian Bell that had me too distracted to care.  Okay, that was just too weird for me not to talk about. Of  course I still cringe thinking about the dumbass that  yelled out "RIVERS!" after this Brian look-alike yelled out  for Matt to play "My Head is in the Sun" but I suppose  having Matt smack his head with the back of his hand  saying "Stupid Rivers, stupid rivers, stupid rivers" and  then turning to the Brian look-alike and saying "dude, you  look so much like Brian Bell it's creepy" was priceless.  Although that could have been the highlight of my night, it  was actually talking to Josh Hager, he is like the coolest  guy ever. He even looked oh so sophisticated with his glass  of wine and wasn't insulted when I told him he reminded me  of Eminem back in November at the Chicago show. He even  gave Becca and I some handy advice on where to live in L.A.  Yes, we did get to talk to Matt again too, but he seemed  kind of out of it, but he was as cordial as ever, and so he  can be forgiven, professional touring musicians are allowed  to have off days too, they don't always have to be  personable enough to our liking, you know? Anyhow, twas' a  very memorable night, and if you haven't checked it out  yet, get "Puckett's Versus the Country Boy" , Matt Sharp's  new EP, definitely some quality stuff. Also, Josh Hager  kicks ass on the lap steel, and maybe at the next Matt  show, I will do more than bump into Greg Brown in the bar,  cuz he is such a cutie and so shy, he deserves some  appreciation too!!!   6/26/03- Chocolate and Art   I finally got a scanner today! I'm really excited because  now that means I don't have to take everyone else's scanner  hostage to scan my art. Although I charged something I  shouldn't have on my credit card, I feel good now, it makes  me want to draw more just so I can show people online more  of my drawings. Well, today work was blah as usual, and the  worst thing possible happened at break, there were boxes of  Russell Stover chocolates on the table in the breakroom, so  naturally I tried one, and being that they were all  assorted and I didn't know what was in them, I ate about 10  of them, which my 115lb. body could not handle too well.  The funny thing is, I wasn't even hungry, what possessed me  to try them was just my curiosity to know what was inside  each of the chocolates, thus making myself feel really  sick, since I'm really sensitive to spikes in my blood  sugar having diabetes running so high in my  family...Next time, I will have the willpower to say no, I  swear!  Well, I got home from work and scanned that one portrait of  Brian I drew and actually had the nerve to post it on the  Space Twins message boards. I was surprised when one of the  girls off the boards messaged me to tell me she liked it.  I'm so worried that Leia is going to think my art sucks  when I send her my sketches because I'm not a professional  artist by any means, but I can't help it, whether I am any  good or not, art is my passion, and it is the one thing  that I really feel at ease and completely lost in when I'm  involved in it. Perhaps she will give me snaps for  trying...Maybe I'm just too hard on myself though.    6/28/03-Lazy Day Off   Okay, I seriously almost wrote an entry yesterday but i was  just too damn depressed. I was called in on my day off and  I was having one of those days when i'm tired the entire  day. Thus, I completely wasted this day off today doing  nothing. However, I did have some extra money so i got a  few cds. One I'm particularly happy about is the new  Starlight Mints cd!!! It does disturb me though that two of  the people in the band have the last name Nunez, and one of  the guys who helped produce the album has the last name  Bell...If you can't figure out why this would disturb me,  don't ask. It is just that I read way too much into little  things like that. I just laughed when I saw it though, so  i'm not going into some psychotic jealous rage or anything  over a stupid name. I have to say, any rock band that  incorporates cello and violin is fucking awesome. I also  bought the newest Ani DiFranco and Tori Amos's "Strange  Little Girls". God, I love Tori so much, I can't wait to  see her in august with my best bud Jut!!! I can't believe I  get excited about something as stupid as getting cds. I'm  such a capitalist whore...oh well. It would be so cool to  be a roadie though, just being with a really cool band and  hanging with them and shit, even if the pay sucks. That  would be great though, I would want to do it for a band  that plays little bars though, there is something so  appealing about that. Arenas are just crap, there is just  too much shit involved and too many people. Well, I hope I  get my period soon, my mom is convinced I'm pregnant and  I'm not. How can you get pregnant if you haven't had sex?  Yes, I'm perhaps one of the oldest American virgins out  there and I really don't care. In fact I'm proud of it. At  least I'm not some ghetto welfare mother because I can't  keep my pants on. Okay, I'm turning bitch now. I went off  on Becca last night because I felt so frustrated at her  being upset with her life. It really bothers me to see my  friends get so down on themselves. I love them so much and  they don't understand that when they hurt, I hurt too  because there is nothing I can do to make them happy. I'm  such a weird happy person and sometimes I feel as if people  just think I'm this naive person who is living in this  unrealistic optimistic bubble. That is not true though. I  realize that I'm not gonna marry my fantasy man; I realize  that I'm never gonna be completely financially comfortable;  i realize that i'm not going to be able to see all the  places I want to see; i realize that when it's all over I'm  not going to feel complete in the way that I imagine. What  I do realize though is that when it's all over I will not  have any regrets. It isn't that I'm naive or overly  optimistic- I just love life and even when I get really  depressed about how life doesn't live up to my wishes,  there are still things out there worth living for; the  world around me, the air, the beauty of art and music, the  sound of a voice, the touch of a hand, my family, making  someone smile, laughter, and most of all my friends and  making a difference in their lives.     7/13/03-Happy Birthday Becca   So it is 12:30 a.m. and it is Becca's birthday, I wish she  weren't so sad, I was happy on my 22nd birthday, why can't  she be? It makes me sad to see close friends of mine  depressed. I wish she could meet some nice man to make her  happy and find more reasons to make her happy...How is it  that I'm single and broke and have a million reasons to be  sad but am not? I guess because I found stuff to pour all  my negative energies into. Unfortunately, I think I annoy  people with all my talk about either the Space Twins (or  stuff relating to them such as Brian Bell) ,art, or moving  to California. I talk way too much and it annoys everyone.  I can't stop though, and why would I want to? I like being  happy. I laugh at the funniest things too. Like the fact  that a lot of the guys I seem to attract seem to be like  Wes...creepy. For example, there was this guy who came in  yesterday to my work and he reminded me of him, like  mannerisms and looks and all. He even flirted like Wes did.  This time though, I saw completely through it. Tis a shame,  because he had this odd kind of charm to him. Oh well, it's  not as if it matters, even if I were looking for a  boyfriend right now, I'm not about to make the same mistake  twice. Anyway, I spent today hanging with Justin which  makes me happy, I love all my friends, especially Becca and  Justin, they are my two favorites, of course they are both  sad all the time, I wish I could make them happy... I hope  I stay friends with them for my whole life. But I guess I  will just have to be there for them like any friend can be  and whether they are happy or not, offer a little wackiness  to their life...heehee. Oh, I'm so on the road to becoming  an art nerd, I'm readin this artists' encyclopedia about  everything to do with the fine arts and I'm also reading  this huge book on the history of western art. If I ever  hope to become an awesome artists, I better know about the  greats as well as some basic art knowledge such as the  properties of oil, alkyd, casein and water color paints.  Okay, I now feel like a big loser. But having art to pour  all my emotions into feels so good...it's better than being  depressed about being alone.    8/17/03-No Power Sucks   Yes!!!! Electricity, water and anything invented after  Thomas Edison is a good thing (well, some things aren't  that great, but I'm not gonna get into that)...So yeah, i  went two days without power and there is no use bitching  about it now, except I missed the Tori concert and now it's  been postponed for Monday and naturally I work monday. So  of course I will do what any other 22 year old female who  thinks that music is way more important than "paper or  plastic? Credit or Debit? Your total comes to $4.20 and of  course Do you have a kroger plus card?" Yeah, I'm calling  in of course!!!  So now that I'm done bitching might I say that I'm insane?  I got more emails from my spanish speaking friends, they  probably all think i'm a fruit who speaks bad spanish, oh  well, it's fun...oh, and I found the most interesting book  ever, it's called "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by  Douglas Adams. Did you know in that book one of the  cardinal rules of the Hitchhiker's guide is "don't forget  to bring a towel" ? I wonder if Towelie from South Park  read that book...and also a babel fish is a fish you stick  in your ear that translates any language, and thus, there  is a website that translates languages called babelfish-  interesting. Oh, and i can't forget this one, to Sass  someone means to have sex with them. So maybe Brian Bell  is "sassy" because he has so much sexual  appeal....hmmm...well that is the LAST time I will call mr.  Bell sassy because I'm sure there is a much more creative  word to use to describe him. Plus, I've never met him,  maybe he is the most unsassy man alive for all i know... (probably not).  Dammit, I start my final semester of college in one week.  Oh, and the glory! The Joy! I get to return to the  wonderful Fazolis restaurant to continue my reign as the  breadstick fairie for a few more months...     8/18/03-*Sigh*   Blah, it's one of those days. I just want this semester to  get started and over with. I want to be in California,  don't know why, i feel the longer i'm here the more i'm  missing out there. God, i hope i don't hate it there. I'm  so lonely...i need to stop whining so much i suppose. I  even don't want to work at Kroger anymore, i'm glad i'm  only there until saturday, i just need a break. I need to  get away from my parents, away from Clarkston, not that Mt.  Pleasant will be any better. It will probably be worse. I  just want to hole myself up in a room and paint all day,  get all of this out of me. GRRRRR!!!!!   8/20/03-Lottapianos   Okay, I know the concert was last night, but as I am  sitting here at my computer at 3 a.m. listening to Tori  Amos, I am still completely stoked about the concert I went  to last night. Everyone there seemed to be so down to earth  and happy, some girl complimented me on my orange patchwork  shirt- my favorite shirt, and everyone was all free to be  themselves, like those two girls being all affectionate  with each other near Justin and I, the one girl even got a  little rose for her girlfriend, it was so cute! You would  never see people like that at a pop concert that's for  sure... As for the actual concert,Ben Folds and Tori were  just AWESOME.Ben Folds is so cool, he certainly likes the  word "fuck" a lot and is such a smart ass. Any person who  can play beautiful piano in a major key yet have a bridge  that goes "you fucking whore" deserves snaps. Oh, and not  to mention his rendition of "give me back my black t-shirt"  in Japanese, that was AWESOME. And of course, I loved his  boy band song..that was classic. I need to get some more of  his stuff. As for the woman herself, Tori is just so beautiful, i wish  i could have been closer to the stage instead of on the  lawn...She was wearing this gold colored flowing dress, I  want to dress like that and look that awesome. She is so  talented!She has such a beautiful voice and I wish I could  play piano like that. I cannot believe she sang and played  piano with very little breaks in between songs for two  hours! I could never be able to do that. Not to mention,  she did a little impromptu song about the Detroit blackout,  which was hilarious, she made it sound all bawdy and  showtunish, it was awesome, and she even had a verse  talking about these two hot boys in the hotel lobby, it was  great. How is it that that woman can look sexy while  playing piano, and she dances in this rhythmic way while  playing, it is hypnotic. I swear, if i was into chicks, i'd  totally have a thing for her like i do for Brian Bell, but  ahh, I don't. I know now though that after seeing her play  live I'm now gonna probably turn into an even bigger Tori  fan...I already have five of her cds! Now I DEFINITELY have  to see her again, and now there are TWO people I want to  meet most in the world, Brian Bell AND Tori Amos.   ...I hope you enjoyed =)

      I'm so pissed off right now. I could have spent the afternoon sleeping but instead wasted my fucking time going to this fucking interview that was fucking ridiculous! Okay, first, when you put ENTRY LEVEL in your job description, that doesn't mean "must have at least 2 years office experience" THAT IS NOT FUCKING ENTRY LEVEL YOU FUCKING MORONS!!!! Second, don't tell me that I should go to a fucking temp agency to get some office experience. I told that lady but that was a waste of my fucking time and I don't have the money to just sit on my ass at home and wait for them to call me. What pissed me off even more was she asked me why I didn't get the job at the internship I had. Well, perhaps it could be because THEY WEREN't FUCKING HIRING!!! Seriously, for a job that is only willing to pay $8.00 an hour with no benefits, they were being awfully picky. Well, I had decided before I even got to the interview that I didn't want the job, but thought it would be in bad taste to leave. I should have walked out on that bitch in the middle of the interview though, especially after she was telling me that I needed more office experience and I said to her "well how do you expect me to get any office experience when people like you won't let me get any office experience?" Also when she mentioned there is an unpaid internship in the evenings I told her "No, I have an apartment and bills to pay, I can't just work for free." Yeah, that is the first time I've actually been a bitch in an interview but seriously that lady fucking pissed me off, I just left without saying goodbye. Needless to say, I don't think I was hired... Just to clear things up though, I'm not pissed off about it, I actually feel relieved because I didn't really want to be paid that low with no benefits and seriously would rather do without a bunch of bratty child actors and their snotty parents that want to make their kids a star. I think from now on I'm going to research the place I'm sending my resume into before accidentally sending it in to a Talent Agency for Child Actors again...  I could really go for ice cream then crashing out on the living room floor right about now.

      I think I have a deficiency of it. No matter how hard I try to be bitchy, it just never comes across that way. Even to telemarketers, if I snap at them for calling me, I apologize afterwards for being mean. What the fuck is wrong with that picture? Here they are interrupting MY precious time and I'm the one apologizing? I guess this is why I am such a doormat. Granted, I'm not as bad as I used to be, I have Wes-the ex-boyfriend to thank for that. But enough about that- I am not very with it today, I managed to scrape the rental car (the second time it's been scraped since Becca and I got it, hopefully the damage waiver will prevent any monetary repurcussions from occurring) and I never got the chance to go back to bed, I have to work tonight at a job that I'm basically fucking sick of and to top it off I've been trying to shake off this melancholy no doubt brought on by this past weekend's stressful events. I hate being like this, mostly because I don't handle stress too well-that's how I developed chronic fatigue syndrome in high school and now I'm stuck with it, which is no fun at all. I don't want to bitch about this anymore though, I am feeling slightly better than I was yesterday but could still use some cheering up. On another note, I had this random thought this morning; it is really interesting living in an area where everyone mistakes me for being Persian. Especially in Glendale, I get hit on by Armenian men and Arab men who start speaking to me in their language assuming I speak Armenian or Farsi (which by the way, I don't, and as far as I know my family is not from Iran). I also get this from work, I'm constantly getting "are you Persian?" Which of course I wonder why I look so damn Persian. Is it my nose? My hair? Eyes? Well at least it's nice to know that if I could manage to pick up the language, throw on a head scarf and their ethnic clothing, I could go about the Middle East without anyone realizing I'm American and thus being ostracized for being one of the minions under the reign of "King" George W.'s regime.... Somedays, I really wish I weren't American.

      YES, Jerry Orbach really DOES make me horny. What can I say? I'm a little freaky...That and I've spent the better part of the evening thus far discussing the concept of Christmas...the notion of well, um, giving and receiving "presents" shall I say? (if you think beyond PG-13 you're on the right track).  I just went in to mess with my hair some more and realize I'm looking kinda punk rock these days with my navy blue t-shirt and my Allie Sheedy long-bangs-in-her eyes brown hair. All I need now is a touch of badass which I don't think I could ever pull off. I don't think I could ever manage to pick up a cigarette nor expose myself in public places....Okay, the latter I don't think is really a requirement, but this did happen at a Dropkick Murphys show once, I got stuck in line with a bunch of girls that almost got me to flash some mormon guy yelling at us calling us heathens and scum. Yeah, he's the one who was wasting away telling people that Joseph Smith was our messiah when the Dropkick Murphys are IRISH CATHOLICS like a lot of punk rockers and also Mormons are the one who believe that there is a planet God is saving for them after death which is why they have to populate the earth as much as they can. Now who the fuck is the crackpot here? Just admit it all you mormons; you like to fuck. No offense to mormons, my great uncle was one and my cousin Christine almost converted. They are nice people and all, just a little crazy to be preaching to a bunch of punk girls who want excuses to show their boobs...and for those of you who are wondering, NO I did not flash the old mormon guy, only special people get to see my boobs =)

      I am thinking I eat too much rice. It is especially bad when I make rice so I don't have to wash out the little pan just to cook some fettuccini. I HATE doing dishes. I really miss the dishwasher I had 2 apartments ago...Oh well, I really wish I had one of those sprayers at least at the sink so I could get into water fights, at least it would make doing dishes a little more eventful... I realized I have this funny little habit I do every morning when I wake up. As soon as I nearly fall out of my huge comfy bed (ooh it's so nice) I always pull up my camisole and scratch my tummy. Isn't that a male habit? It's kind of odd that I do that, but my tummy always itches in the morning, really strange. I think that's the only strange morning habit I have, besides having conversations with myself.  Okay, astronauts talking about mounting each other on sealab 2021- I love adult swim!

      I think god was late when he decided for me to be born or something...because I can't relate to anyone my age. It saddens me when I can't have in depth conversations about The Cure's "Jupiter Crash" leaves me in a trance for 30 minutes after it's ended, or how The Smith's "There's a Light that Never goes out" is the only song that pulls me out of a depression instead of putting me into one and how when I'm feeling especially angsty nothing fixes it more than blasting "Confessions" by The Violent Femmes. Who the fuck cares about American Idol? That isn't REAL music. It's a fucking contest, these people don't write their own music, they don't spill their emotions into words and music for the world to hear. It is just about whether they can look good and sing cookie-cutter songs that people will sing to because they don't bother seeing what else is out there. I'm thankful for my musical upbringing because thanks to my parents wide array of musical tastes, I grew up listening to everything from obscure psychedelic 60s rock, 70s metal, singer songwriter, bluegrass, old 1930s speakeasy blues to the jazz hour on the college radio stations in Detroit. This started me on a road to later discovering bands such as The femmes, The Cure, The Smiths, The Pixies, The Vandals, Dead Kennedys, Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Replacements, The Jam, Depeche Mode and many many many more. I really should have been this age in the 80s, instead of being stuck in this age of reality TV and gastric bypass surgery...  ...not that the 80s were that great of a decade either, but at least there was no such thing as "The Swan."

      Yeah, this weekend has kind of sucked so far. Last night on her way out of work yesterday, Becca rammed into a mercedes and crunched the front right side of her car, messing up the right blinker and causing this horrible rubbing sound while driving it. This sucks because she now thinks she's a bad driver which is not true. Whenever I tell people about it they are like "Jenny, shouldn't that have been YOU who hit the parked car?" Okay, okay, I'm a bit of a space cadet and have hit mobile objects numerous times with my past vehicles, but never enough to do a lot of damage to it. This just happened to be the case of an idiot who didn't park far enough away from the curb so they wouldn't get rammed when someone tries to pull a right onto Ventura with the sun and other parallel parked cars blocking their view. This does not make Becca a bad driver. I guess it doesn't help that when she got the rental this morning, she kind of scraped it against the pole that is next to our tiny-as-hell parking spot, but I just told her to tell enterprise that this happened when she was grocery shopping, so it looks like someone else scraped the car. Not that the scrape is even that bad. To ease her worries, I just parked the rental out on the street, since I'm semi-okay at street parking...although I had to park the damn thing up the hill, which I hate doing. There are some disadvantages to living up the side of a mountain sometimes...Either way, it's nice to know that I am able to go to work today and won't be completely broke on my next paycheck although I'm still looking for another job that gives me FULL TIME hours and halfway decent pay. Not that $9.00 an hour for folding towels is bad or anything, I'm just sick of not having my nights or weekends. I want to go out for a change dammit!

      Get your mind out of the gutter you perve! It isn't that kind of fuck fest, though that would be nice...*evil grin* No, I just spent a fucking hour in traffic and all I did was go to the bank to cash a check and the post office to mail out a father's day gift for Becca. What the hell is with driver's in Glendale? They seem worse than the drivers throughout the rest of L.A. I hate driving down Brand the most though because fucking SUVs think they have to take up two fucking lanes to make a fucking right turn!!!! What the fuck is wrong with these people? They obviously need to go to fucking driving school or something because I'm fucking sick of dealing with these fucking idiots!!! Okay, and the post office was fucking ridiculous. Those fucking morons expected me to fucking package my own fucking mail. Isn't that what they get paid for? What a fucking waste of my fucking precious time....Now I'm fucking hungry and need to get some fucking food.  Okay, I think I'm done now, I have to fucking go to work in fucking 30 minutes and work all fucking day and have to waste my fucking friday night at work.  Now I'm REALLY fucking done. By the way, Happy Fucking Birthday Will =)

      It seems whenever I have a day off I'm even less productive than usual-I get up at 7:00 drive Becca to work, then I get back around 9:30-10:00ish, lay back down until noon, take a shower and sit in front of the computer until almost 5:00, then leave to go pick Becca up from work and come back and sit in front of the computer again. I really really really need to get out of this apartment. My brain is fried about what to do though...choices are like kryptonite to indecisive people such as I. I will seriously spend 15 minutes in just the pasta aisle of the grocery store so you can imagine what it's like when I'm in the bookstore or Tower Records....let's just say my entire day is wasted and often times I come out empty handed because I can't settle on just one item. My ex-boyfriend Wes did make a good point with his socialist rants- we don't honestly need all these choices that Capitalism gives us. However, I know that if the choices weren't there, I'd be bitching about how there is no selection. Plus, sometimes I like to be indecisive because then it motivates me to really evaluate what I NEED and what I merely WANT. For example, working at Bed, Bath and Beyond I see so many things that I would want such as a $100 dollar espresso maker and things I really need such as a rug for the entry way to the apartment or a nice set of dishes. Of course, the espresso maker sounds so good though... Back to the original point though, I probably won't do shit today, unless I can motivate myself to do some dishes. After nearly having an asthma attack in the shower though, I think I'll just crash out in the middle of the living room floor...

      Yes, it's true. I sold out to the girly pink color. I hate pink, but the color in the template said "Rose" and since that's my middle name and I have some vain qualities about me, I wanted to use it to make things a little different. Anyway, my home team The Detroit Pistons WON THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP!!!!!! I'm so euphorically happy! Too bad I was at work when all this transpired...Oh well, I probably would have half watched the game because I can't seem to hold an interest in anything for more than five minutes, I'm as bad as a little kid with A.D.D. mmm...chocolate I wish I had some deep philosophical thoughts to put in here, but I don't really. I read my tarot this morning and drew the fool card, which is very interesting. This tells me that someone new- a spontanous person with childlike qualities- has entered my life and is going to push me to change for the better, and also that I need to start taking more risks and to stop worrying about what other people think. I'm about to enter a new phase of my life and I need to start experiencing new things.  Silly rabbit, didn't you know tarot isn't for real? Well, it is for me...

       I've been so fucking tired lately it's driving me crazy. It isn't that I haven't had anything worth writing about, it's the fact that I haven't had the energy to get my lazy ass to write it down. It isn't as if I'm working tons of hours either, I'm still barely clearing 30 hours a week at my job which totally sucks. I am feeling extra stressed about the fact that I still have yet to find a full time job, but it isn't as if I can do anything about it right now. Anyway, I am not going to be a whiner. I want to extend a belated happy birthday to miss Becca my badass roommate who turned 23 on July 13th- the Camera Obscura show was awesome, the Troubadour is seriously one of the best places to see a rock show! Also I'd like to extend another belated birthday to Mr. Nicholas Schmelter, who turned 22 on July 14th, though he won't read this. Ahhh...if he only knew what nasty little fantasies I had about him almost the entire year that I lived next door to him junior year of college. Man was that boy HOT. I just wanted to tie him to my bed and make him scream. I wonder how he would have felt about that...Perhaps not so bad judging by his little "you can have some of my delicious cream in your mouth" comment that one saturday afternoon. 'tis a shame, I would have so had no-strings-attached fucks with him....Speaking of that, I still think Brad is a completely sexy man, even though I found out he's nearly 41 and married with two kids- who is a shameless flirt! I don't do men who are with children, I'm not about to be a homewrecker and I love kids way too much to break up their family just for the sake of my carnal urges which I NEVER act upon since I'm so fucking shy and timid. Grrrr!!!! Damn my high morals!!!   Nothing else on the horizon it seems at the moment, my little brother Jason is turning 22 August 11th and I have to think of a present to get him...Since I'm still completely broke off my ass it looks like he'll have to deal with a $20 gift card from Best Buy. Oh well.  On one last sad note, the awesome band that hails from L.A., Ozma has called it quits. Such a great band, such a shame the guys couldn't settle their differences and continue to rock out. I'm just sad that I never got the opportunity to see them perform live at least once. I guess I'll just have to leave y'all with this great line from their song "come&nbsp;home Andrea"    Tonight i'll be a whore for you and you can dance for me...

      I AM SO FUCKING PISSED!!! Okay, I've been wanting to see this band Silver for a really, really long time. I've checked out L.A. Weekly every week to see if they've been playing and haven't seen anything since moving out here. So today I get this urge to check out the Spaceland website and guess who's playing? SILVER. So I get all excited until I see that they are playing TONIGHT! Yeah, tonight. Tonight I have to work until 10:30. NO FUCKING WAY. I'll be perfectly honest there are various reasons why I want to see this band so bad-some reasons I won't name...but this pisses me off. I can't call in tonight though. I'm just going to have to hope they play some more gigs around L.A. sometime soon...WHEN I'M NOT WORKING. God, Irony has really been having a lot of laughs at my expense lately. Well, I just hope that in the end, I'm the one who gets the last laugh...

      Man do I feel like an ass. Did I ever bother to notice that Brad wears a fucking WEDDING RING? Not to mention he has two kids...Not that it matters, I told you I'm a pro at lusting after unattainable men...It seems I have progressed to older married men with kids, how evil am I. I am SO prepping myself to be the "other" woman. Either way, Brad is still my favorite manager. He is still hot. His kids are no doubt cute as hell as is his wife. Conclusion: who cares?

      Okay, let's face it: EVERYONE, at one time or another, has to have a hot boss that they have innapropriate fantasies about. Especially if you are like me who has this thing with older men AND authority figures. In an S&M relationship, I would so be the Masochist. Well, except in the case of Nicholas Schmelter but that was another story, he so needed to be tied to a bed and whipped...Back to what I was saying though- EVERYONE has to have a hot boss. Well, I have one. His name is Brad and he isn't really physically my type but I'll admit it; he is fucking hot. He is probably about 5'10, blonde hair, blue eyes, skinny,flaky in that cute kind of way and is 35. I don't know what it is but I keep getting crushes on men born between the years of 1967 and 1969. Not that I have a crush on Brad, I mean come on, he's my BOSS. I just think he's kinda cute...But it doesn't help when I have Becca saying dirty stuff about Brad all the time and I have to work with him and pretend that I don't talk about him lying naked on satin sheets or walking around in one of our fluffy bath towels. I had to keep my composure last night at work because that man would probably turn 4 shades of red if he knew the way I talked about him when he wasn't around. I still don't understand how this guy is single though. Not gay either, though a few people have made comments about how they thought he was when they first met him. He is just a little effeminate, that's all. I know of another man I like who is the same way...though probably not single, but who cares, I've never even met  him  so we won't talk about that...Yeah, so back to what I was saying, my boss is totally fuckable. BUT I WON'T because he's way too professional to do something like that, not to mention it is something I could always fantasize about doing but never actually do. So, whenever Brad ever says "step into my office" I'll just have to keep a straight face and try not to blush...too much.

      Our forefathers would be fucking rolling around in their graves if they knew what has become of our country. Well, maybe not, because maybe they were big assholes like our current leaders...Today it was announced that John Edwards is John Kerry's running mate for the presidential election. I really don't know how I feel about John Kerry but I can't stand Bush and would elect Elmo into office if it meant not having him for our president anymore. I don't understand all this shit that opponents of the "war" in Iraq get from our fellow Americans. How are we not  patriots? During the Revolutionary war the patriots were the ones who opposed popular opinion too. They wanted to protect their freedom and were willing to fight for it. Well, going to war over whatever Bush is going to war over (what is it again? Weapons of Mass Destruction? Terrorism? Oil? I forgot, he keeps changing the reason...)I don't understand. This is not protecting our freedoms, if anything we are being hindered more by this war. We can't voice our opinions freely without practically having the FCC smack a big black CENSORED tag over our mouth. Case in point: Fahrentheit 9/11, the documentary by Michael Moore. He openly criticizes the policies of our leader which in the Constitution we have the freedom to do. How come nobody made a big deal over the republicans criticizing Bill Clinton's infidelities which is seriously none of our business but when the democrats criticize Bush's economic and diplomatic practices we are criticized? This is hypocracy at it's worst. Although I celebrated the freedom of our country on The 4th of July back on Sunday, it made me sad at the same time. I don't feel free anymore. We are told through the media how free we are. I don't believe we really are. We are only free if we agree with what our leaders agree with. If we live our life differently from everyone else, believe in things that are not within popular belief, we are traitors, we are freaks, we are outcasts. We must be silenced, and thus are not free. I will not be silenced. This is not a brave new world and I will think and say what I will and I will give my life first before someone tells me how the fuck to think.  I cry for my country sometimes, on the inside. I don't like what this nation stands for anymore. It is supposed to stand for freedom but now it stands for power, riches and repressing others who don't think as we do. The world is full of wonderful people and so many different cultures and we don't accept that. We want conformity. God made us different from each other to give the world color. Rich, wonderful, brilliant color. Our leaders want us to be all black and white and no in between. I will not accept that. How sad that when people mistake me for being persian or Italian I smile but when I am referred to as an american, I hang my head in shame...

      I'm so hungry right now. Hungry and tired. I got up at 7:30 and had a job interview at 11:00. Even my vanilla latte couldn't wake me up. However, the interview went really well. Amy, the woman who interviewed me was extremely impressed by my portfolio and previous work experience. That doesn't mean I think I can get the job, but at least I know that there is nothing else I could have done to make it better. It now all depends on whether others being interviewed have more qualifications than I do. However, this is the first place I've interviewed at since graduating college that I can actually see myself working. I really would love to work there, because it's PR which is what I got my fucking degree in, and it is a small, casual environment. Plus, I'd get to do a lot of writing and that is something that I love. However, if I don't get the position which could happen- I'm going to try my best not to get upset and just keep looking, which is what I'm going to be doing anyway. I just hope that I don't have to wait too long, because there is only so much more $200/week paychecks I can take and not to mention towel folding and working until 10:30 at night. Yeah, I'm such a sell-out. I want to work normal hours like the other drones. Perhaps the only thing that I want to have which is normal. I thrive on variety and uniqueness, but when it comes to not being able to buy espresso makers and cute panties, I am willing to make an exception and accept normality... I would make my socialist ex-boyfriend proud; I finally sold out to the dirty capitalist values of this fucked up country I call home.

      I would like to extend a very happy birthday to my little brother Jason- of course not so little anymore, now that he's at the ripe old age of 22...I just got off the phone with him in fact and feel that I must dedicate an entry to my favorite (and only) sibling. Although I wanted you dead for most of my childhood, I'm glad I never killed you becuase you make life a little more interesting and I seriously don't think I could handle mom and dad on my own. So with that being said I'd like to apologize for a few things-  1. For "twisting your skin" and "pulling your ears" so much growing up that you now have a permanently deformed face.  2. For nearly rendering you sterile that one time I got really pissed at you and kicked you REALLY hard in the "family jewels" (heehee)  3. For asking mom to take you back to the hospital after you were born.  4. For doing stuff I wasn't supposed to be doing and blaming it on you.  5. For beating you up until you became big enough to beat me up.  I must say, I'm proud of the fact that you were able to get through that and are now a strong, burly military man. (Woohoo!) I still pity you for having to stay with mom and dad for another 8 months, poor thing...If you ever want to come to Cali and check out some cool comic book stores or pick up a cute little japanese chick, that would be totally cool!  As a final note, Jason is one of the funnest people to go shopping with- only he will say the most innappropriate things at the most inappropriate times- like talking about wanting to cut up little kids while waiting in line at a restaurant. Now that is a classy fella for you... He must have inherited that from mom.

      I think I've said this before- L.A. is a very strange place. I don't mind the strangeness, but there are things that do bother me. One thing that REALLY bothers me is that people are so involved with themselves that they seem to forget that they are sharing existence with thousands of other people. I noticed that this is REALLY bad on the west side. It seems Hollywood is the great divider; East of Hollyweird you get all the artsy fartsy kids in Los Feliz, Silverlake and Atwater Village(near my hood)- all these cats spend their time going to rock shows, art galleries and indie movie theaters and hate anything material, unless they are just poser hipster kids who think hanging out at the coffee shop with a cigarette hanging out of your mouth and a notebook in front of you makes you cool...But west of Hollyweird, it's different. This is where you run into the divas, the celebrity wannabes, the high maintenance fake trash. Don't get me wrong, I have friends that live on the West side, but Santa Monica mind you, which is tolerable. These Beverly Hills/Westwood/West L.A. peeps though, walk around with their cell phones surgically attached to their heads wearing their latest designer thread fresh from their most recent batch of botulism to keep their face from falling off....It's funny really, how different people from the same city can be. Can you tell that I love living on the east side? I'd take the beatnik hipster life any day, I refuse to ever be a golddigging whore dating the latest trend whether it be tennis players or "ugly" rock stars and keeping my plastic surgeon on speed dial. With that being said, here's one final thought: Why someone would  willingly  have themselves injected with botulism is beyond me...

      I would like to clarify something: I DO NOT KNOW BRIAN BELL. I got a very nice email from a girl who went to the old weezer fan site that Becca and I used to run back in college and saw some picture i'd posted of Brian and asked me if I took that picture...that made me laugh. This isn't the first time I've got this. I mean, maybe it is because I live in L.A. and all, but honestly, I haven't met him. I have met Pat, Scott, Matt Sharp, Karl Koch and used to go into the vintage clothing store back in college ran by Mikey Welsh's ex-roommate, but I have NEVER even so much as exchanged a "hello" with Brian. ( I do have a guitar pick of his though that my cousin got for me from Bobby Schneck at a weezer show a few years ago in Irvine). Not that that's been cleared up, I thought I would maybe dedicate an entry in here to a band I used to be obsessed with off and on over the years... I was maybe 14 or 15 when I first saw their video for "buddy holly" on MTV before school one morning. I just remember instantly thinking "oh my god, this band rocks!" and my second thought thinking that this had to be a joke, a bunch of 20-somethings dressed up on the set of "Happy Days." I loved the fact that it was so  different  at the time, and instantly fell in love (so to speak) with the band. Of course, I was a poor 8th grader so I never got around to buying the cassette (yes kids, a tape cassette, cd players were still an OPTION in the mid-90s). So since I couldn't buy their music, I just watched MTV every morning and wouldn't leave the house until after the video came on. This meant a lot of times being late for the bus because I had to walk from my house to the bus stop in 6 feet of slushy snow...(god, i don't miss that). So you know who was my favorite band member back then? Yes, Brian Bell. I thought he looked the nerdiest and even as a 14 year old thought it was totally hot when he mouthed "I love you" to that cute girl in the sweater, showing lots of tongue...Well, like many others, I just thought they broke up until about early 2001 when I started dating Wes, whose best friend Dave was obsessed with the band. This is when I started coming across a few articles about them again, went to their website (since the internet had pretty much permeated society by then) , which at the time was still two websites, RWA(rebel weezer alliance) and Weezer.net. So now that I was a somewhat-functioning adult, I went out and bought the blue album and pinkerton (green album hadn't come out yet). After that I became increasingly obsessed with this band and read every article I could find on them, downloaded every demo-bootleg-video-whatever I could find of theirs, and even got some money together to see them in concert. This was rather funny too, because the day after I found out about the tickets going on sale, the news about Mikey Welsh checking himself into a "mental institution" came out. So this created some questions about whether the concert was going to happen, who would be the bassist, etc. Ironically the day the tickets went on sale was my first day back at college for my sophomore year, so of course the first thing I did was hook up my computer but wound up using my roommate's to buy the tickets. This was just the beginning of a crazy obsession. The concert did happen as it turned out, even though it was only about a week after september 11th, at Cobo Arena in Detroit. I went with my friends Kandi and Justin, and we got possibly the best seats you could get at one of Weezer's shows- floor-front and center. I realized a girl my size does not belong in the midst of a most pit though, here I was right in front of Rivers, could see the sweat on his forehead but was getting kneed and elbowed in the ribs, eye, boob, you name it. So I had to move to the left, so this time wound up in front of Brian whom I had all but forgotten about...well until then, that is. Keep in mind, I had screwed up his name again and thought his name was Pat, and Pat Wilson's name was Brian Bell (don't ask). So here I was completely going ga-ga over Brian's cute smile and spent the whole next day gushing over Pat Wilson, but not really...I finally realized my mistake in an unfortunate incident...when my ex-boyfriend came over and started talking about how hot Brian was ( I swear Wes was gay or just a freak because the way he talked about some guys was just wrong). Well after this, I started developing this little crush on Brian which turned into a big crush after I discovered the Space Twins and then all these interviews with him I'd never seen before. Now, I don't know him so I can't completely assume this, but friends of mine would read these interviews and tell me that he reminded them of me. So I started making these weird comparisons to my personality and his. Now the fact that our birthday's are a week apart or the fact that neither one of us eats red meat or that we both like a lot of the same things doesn't count- I mean stuff like we say things before thinking and wind up looking incredibly dumb, we both talk way too much, are kind of shy around strangers until we feel comfortable around them, are obsessed with space...I'm sure these feel like a stretch and make me sound crazy...so I guess I felt like I kind of shared a nice little connection with him. Let me clarify as well that I DON'T get crushes on strangers, especially rock musicians, actors or any other form of celebrity. I feel much more comfortable if I actually know the guy and can try to do something about it. The age thing never really mattered, I often times get crushes on men about ten years older than myself, but the rock musician thing, made me uncomfortable. Anyway, this definitely fueled my obsession with Weezer, which included three more concerts of theirs (one which involved too much pot and another one which involved them playing in my hometown of Clarkston and my getting lost not even 2 miles from my parent's house). A website in the summer of 2002 added to this obsession, and is even linked on weezer.com though it is pretty much defunct now that Becca and I are out of college and all the old html files are on my computer that crashed back in January. However, if you ever want to check it out, the url is  urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/weezer_and_stuff - I have to say though, looking back on this obsession, which really isn't that strong anymore, it is funny how much I was able to learn about one band. Also damn, I got to meet almost all of them! By the way, although I'm hardly obsessed with Weezer anymore, I still have a crush on Brian Bell and love his work with his band the space twins so if you ever want to check  them  out, check out some of their tunes at  urlLink www.spacetwins.com . Now that I may be responsible for an increase in sales for Weezer's next album from this entry, I DO expect at least a small cut of the royalties....

      So yesterday I was SO excited to go to the Getty, but instead, Becca and Dennis decided that going to the mall and playing "dress me Jenny" was much more fun. I know they were trying to cheer me up because I was such a downer, and I appreciate that. It is funny, because I felt like such a barbie doll since I am like a size 4 or 5 and 5'4 so I could fit into all the cute petite clothing. It is just embarassing when I had to have the sales ladies go back to get my an extra small because the small was too big. I normally really like shopping, but lately going into stores, ANY kind of store, reminds me of the fact that I have no money to spare. I am not even going to get into my jerk off of a boss (not Brad, but Joe, the new guy). It just pisses me off how I have to deal with their shit until I can find a new job because making some money is better than making none. Today I get to go to a wedding, one of Becca's friends from college is getting married today. I'm actually sitting here all dressed up drinking a cup of coffee. Weddings depress me...it reminds me of how I'm probably never going to get married or seriously date anyone again because I can't manage to get past hello with any guy I'm interested in. However, I'm not going to get into that today. Frankly, I just hate weddings, but it is nice to be doing something different for a change. Job interviews all week have stressed me out and I really need to CHILL. So that is what I'm going to do. I've been really thinking of starting a story, and now would be the best time to start writing it- let out all this negative energy I've been holding in. The story is actually is going to be based on many different things, such as many sci-fi movies I've seen, some novels I've read, but mostly from this Space Twins song I love called "rings of saturn." The story is also going to bring in some of my beliefs about reincarnation and fate and all that nonsense. I won't get into  the premise of the story too much, but it is going to involve two people, a man and a woman who are each other's mirror images in terms of souls, beginning at the beginning of time who get seperated by time and space whose life mission is to be reunited with each other. I'm not going to try to make it too romantic-lovey-dovey-cheesy, because this is actually meant to be a tragic story, and will they actually reunite, I'm not sure of. I just know that I really want to write this, as a sort of homage to my love of science fiction, my belief in twin souls searching for one another and especially my love for The Space Twins =)

      For those of you who know me, you probably know that I'm pretty big into all this new age bullshit. It isn't uncommon to hear me say "he's SO a virgo rising" or "I can't date him because he has too much bad karma." Yeah, so I'm a new age freak. Thank you mother and all your Cherokee heritage/religious philosophy you exposed me to. Anyhow, besides doing astro charts, I also read Tarot cards and might even delve into reading Runes, an old Celtic form of divination ( I don't do palmistry, that just confuses me, especially if you have dry cracked palms). Back to what I was saying, I am a tarot reader. Not advanced by a long shot, I still have to refer to my many reference books on Tarot to give an affective reading. Well, last week I picked up this book about Past lives and tarot. YES, I do believe in past lives. Although I was raised a Lutheran, and my father cringes whenever I talk about reading tarot cards or anything else that can be described as "new age bullshit" , I still have trouble believing that in the history of the world, we are only given one chance at life. Especially when you have universal knowledge that we seem to be inherently given upon birth. Psychologist Carl Jung went further into this sort of study with his theory of "archetypes" which included these roles that we automatically know of, such as heroes, mother, father, teacher, etc. How do we adopt these roles? Perhaps from environmental factors, but I think there is a strong possibility that there is still some knowledge left within us about past lives we have lived. Okay, whatever, I'm a fucking fruit, I don't care. To continue, I decided to do a spread to see if I was somehow connected with this certain person whom I've always wondered if I "knew" in another life. Well I did find out that if I am indeed connected with this person, we were never able to complete our purpose together, because in one life I was married to an extremely possessive person and this other person was much too young for me; another life, perhaps the one that most bothered me, I was married to this person but we were unable to have a child together and this caused extreme sadness and discontent in our life. What really struck me as interesting about this spread was not our lives together though; it was the lives we spent apart from each other. In all my other lives, I was in some way or another, a rich, overindulgent, slut. Yes, that is true. I was a slut in another life. That and I ate too much, drank too much, spent money like it was water, you name it. No wonder In this life I'm a financially struggling, shy, skinny, non-smoking/drug using/partying girl who never gets laid.... For those of you who were completely freaked out by this post. You have every right to be.

      That is all I can think about right now. Finding a full time job. Even when I try to sleep and forget about it for awhile, I still dream about filling out resume's, hearing those words "we'll get back with you if we're interested" and all that other bullshit that comes with looking for a job. I've reached this point where I don't fucking care. I just want a job where I am working 9-5, Monday-Friday. I just want to know when I'm working and knowing how much money I'm getting out of each paycheck. None of this all-of-a-sudden 13 hours bullshit. That completely pissed me off when my hours got slashed worse than Jack The Ripper's poor innocent victims...You know what is really sad though? The main reason why I want a job soon is so I can just up and quit my current job and see the look of fury on their faces when they have to find someone to cover my shifts. That'll show them to fuck with me. I figure it's an eye for an eye, Fuck with Jenny, I'll fuck with you.
