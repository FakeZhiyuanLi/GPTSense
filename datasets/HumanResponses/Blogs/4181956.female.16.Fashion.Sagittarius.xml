      Yesterday, after work, during which i did not do another post, having too much fun obviously! But later in the afternoon, Michael came to see me. We had a really nice time and stuff but as we were leaving i told him (just in passing) that i'd shared a bed with a mutual friend of ours. Obviously nothing happened because, as i have said, i love Mich a very much. But he got REALLY upset about it. At first i decided to try and make myself cry to get him to forgive me but i couldn't, so he's going away for a week so i just said: 'have a nice  week' and left the station. Then  didnt need to try anymore, i burst into tears and went round the side of the station. But then i thought: he's going away so i dont want to leave it like this and i went back in, i saw him turning round and walking back to the platform, so he'd come looking for me. I ran after him and was really really crying, and we sort of made up, but he was still annoyed with me. So i also cried all the way home, and went the longest way i could so as to avoid having to tell my family why i was upset. I got home and wrote him a relly long email saying that i was sorry but i didnt really think anything of it, he's just  friend. Anyway, i cried  lot more writing it, and then i sent it, then i read this incredibly sad chain letter from my friend Katy, which i'll post one day, and that set me off again. Then I rang Michael, after he'd read the email and was really really crying again!! But he was ok again and still in luff with me. But i couldn't stop crying, i was just sitting there, hardly able to breathe because i was crying so hard and then i got really bored of crying for no reason, but i couldnt stop, so i decided to read this amazing book called  Stop Pretending  by... Sonia Simmons or something. It's so brilliant, it's a book of poems this woman wrote when she was a teenager about her sister going crazy and all the memories of before, and visiting her in the psychiatric ward and stuff. And it's so sad, so at least i had something to cry about. It kind of scared me, because i just couldnt stop crying. And just now i'm playing soltaire and i've nearly finished and there's two cards still hidden and i cant finish it, and it's making me want to cry. I have a really good life and i'm so lucky with everything, but i feel like everything's all wrong sometimes and like if i start crying i'll never stop.

      Oh wow. it's Beautiful. It's sort of like a nurses dress, but it's got blue and white gingum on the shoulders and buttons and this amazing big collar. Yes, fellow bloggers, i am in love with a dress. Which is why i love my job, and the 30% discount i get. The dress of my dreams is but 8pounds 40pence :) Yessssssssss.  However, enough of that. The shop, is as usual, deserted but nothing can hold me down because i am INCREDIBLY happy!! My impetigo is almost nothing more than a distant memory and Mich rang me last night and told me that he's never ever loved anybody like he loves me and wants to marry me. Obvious not deluded enough to marry me now, i am but sixteen years of age (seventeen on the twelfth of september ;) ) but we've talked about breaking up when he goes to uni and stuff, and he was genuinely upset. I'm so in love with him it kind of scares me, no-one has ever liked me back as much as i like them! But obviously loving every minute of it :)  Oh My GOD!! Did i tell you about the Georgia Nicholoson books?! Aka: the funniest books in the entire world!! Well, my mother, beng the absolutely STAR that she is, bought me the four and fifth in the series! 'Dancing in my nuddy pants' which i finished the same day, and '...and that's when it fell off in my hand' which i'm trying to read marginally more slowly :) There are not enough 'very's in the world to describe how very very very funny they are. Louise Rennison is my comical idol, Frida Kahol is my artisic one. I think Gwen Stefani must be my musical idol, just because she exudes cool at all times and her wedding dress faded into pink at the bottom. My fashion idol... i'd like to say someone really obscure but it's probably someone like Kate Moss, just because she looks effortlessly fantastic everytime i see her, and well, after the White Stripes video i think pretty much every sane girl in the world wants to be her!!  So, last monday i wrote this huuuuuuge long blog about this party that i'd been to and how a brick had fallen on my foot etc, and it was easily as long as this one and then stupid 'blogger' (if that is even your real name) crapped up and wiped it all.  So i shall sign off at this point, but i will be back, oh yes, i will be back, mainly because i have nothing else to do, but partly because my foot swelled up due to my impetigo, and not only do i want to document my pain,  also think i owe it to other sufferers to warn of the dangers  Bye dig xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      When i used to work avec ma soeur in Boogaloo, Snack time was pretty much all of the time. There's a Spar literally opposite and because there was two of us we used to just pop over every so often to buy a... chocolate bar or AMAZING hobnob flapjack bar. However, i now work on my onesy and therefore there will be no more 'popping over to Spar for an AMAZING hobnob flapjack bar' no matter how amazing. I have found ways around this though, today, for instance, i brought in my own snack, only working two hours means i can go home in one hour and eighteen minutes, and make me a egg on toast concoction. But for these towo hours, instead of the prefered packet of crisps or chocolate bar (which, incidently, we dont have in our house) i have brought a small sandwich bag containing the following: 5x Scotch Eggs Some lettuce 1x Tomato Some ham    Have eaten everything but the tomato, which i have started on now :)  So, yesterday was Hastings Carnival. My bestest friend Katy got back from holiday on Thursday and so stayed round my house on Friday night, Saturday, after work i went up to her house for some eats, then we walked to the pier and bought some sweeties, then decided we wanted to swim, and therefore chipped up to my house, grabbed some stuff then went swimming :) It was not warm, but soooooo much fun!! It was really funny. Then she had to go to some sort of wedding reception (shelfish) so then i met my other best friend, Josh. He's the best! I've known Joshie all my life, he used to live across the road from me, but then he moved into a much nicer house, still near though. I love Josh like a brother, he's so sweet and generous and fit fit fit!! Uh-oh someone just walked into the shop wearing a PONCHO- i am morally opposed. Anyway, so i love Josh, but he is the biggest townie ever!! I'm not exactly Grungie, but Josh is all about the skin-tight nike caps and track suit-bottoms. So are all his friends, we saw LOADS of his friends. I was with him and his friend Seamus, and they just knew everyone out! Hastings Carnival used to be amazing when i was smaller, everyone's out and about and having fun. The sun, although not exactly shining, was sporadically glancing down upon the bright, loud floats and Hastings folk throwing pennies at them- the kids trying to get them on the float; the wankers trying to hit the people on them; the pikies picking up the ones that fall on the floor. It's the same every year. I personally prefer Bonfire Night, everyone stays out really really late and sit around the bonfire on the beach. The Carnival started at three o' clock this year, earlier than usual. The fireworks started about half nine, I was home by ten. But it was good fun. Then I rang my boyfriend, Michael, i love him a very much. Right I have to go now, no-one's bought anything yet and i'm even boring myself Signing off Me x x x x

      Have been sitting in Boogaloo for one hour and 42 minutes, think someone's going to buy a get cutie skirt- i love it! It's saturday, so i finish in aproximately... 18  minutes- woop woooo!! Anyway, my point: Today i have been researching Frida Kahol, she's definately my idol. She was amazing. She suffered from polio at the age of like, seven, so her foot was deformed and her leg was stunted. Then she had a crazy car crash and a pole stuck through her pelvis and stomach. But she was this amazing amazing painter, most people believe she used painting as therepy as she only ever painted alone, even though she was a painting teacher for a spell. She married this other painter called Diego Riveria, and they had a crazy tremulous relationship, where they both had extra-marrital affairs and separated, then divorced, then remarried. There's a film about Frida Kahol, and i defiantely recommend it, apart from being an awesome story, it's excellently depicted and directed brilliantly. I basically order you to watch it, it is a cultural classic, and should be apreciated by everyone alive! OK, i'm done, time is now: 11:49 so this took me all of seven minutes. Chipping off now Dust x x x x

      First ever entry, yay! Had one of these crazies before but was crap at keeping it up. This time however i have 6 hours every monday sitting at work, doing SFA so i thought i'd give it another go! I'm a little worried because i keep talking to my boyfriend on the phone and discovering i have nothing to say, this scares me a little because a) i like to talk, especially the Mich and b) it must mean  am a very boring person, i'm sure i never used to be! A few weeks ago i got Impetigo, go to Google and search for it in images if you a) want to know what it is and b) want to be sick. I had it on the corner of my mouth but the cream killed the little bastard, but now it's back with a vengance! And this time it's inside my right nostril. Also i got a cigarette burn the other week and i think thats now infected too!! I have a theory that 'Impetigo' (if that is even your real name) really affects you mentally too, because before and now i feel really down. It doesnt really help that it hurts to move my face i guess but ce la vie. Oooh, French! i get my GCSE results on 26th. My boyfriend was supposed to be coming with me but he's jetting off to switzerland- convieniently. At the moment it is monday, and therefore i am at work. Sitting on a black leather stool behind the counter, listening to the Commitments album for the second time in a row. I work in Boogaloo, a vintage clothes shop in the Old Town of Hastings. If anyone hasn't been to Hastings, East Sussex, England you need to get involved. Many will mock the nightlife, but i personally LOVE it. Hastings is all about thursday nights! Brass Monkey for free, I recommend Pink Pussy Shooters, just 3 quid! Then on to the Crypt at about... 12 ish? fiver to get in, 80's music until 2am! I love it so much! Not technically old enough, but who's gonna know??  I'd like to let you all know that it's raining, the forecast is hot hot hot but the reality is rain rain rain. But still kinda hot i guess. which isnt a good thing! My god i hope no-one reads this! I have resorted to discussing weaher in my first ever entry!!  But still, let me paint the picture: The shop is small, and quiet but the day hasnt been too bad. Better than most mondays. In the middle there is a stand for dresses, the nicest retro skirts you've ever seen. Directly infront of me, blocking a total view of the door are mini skirts, cord skirts, womens shirts, leather jackets, bomber jackets, cord jackets, and really pretty little vest tops. On my right is a green wall, to my right are Pamela Mann tights and womens t-shirts. Then there's a door leading to the changing room. Walking through that door is like walking into a different time zone. Everything is 70's, the chairs, the curtains, the lava lamp. It's all very kitsch. As you come back out of the changing room, you see a shelving unit with Mens t-shirts, converse trainers and more little vests. Then there are mens t-shirts hanging up, along with vintge t-shirts, vintage shirts, collared t-shirts, vintage levis, pop jeans and jumpers. Along the front of the shop are more vintage t-shirts, and a new range we've got in recently called Electric Jam, which do bikinis and summer tops and hotpants, and seem to favour owl prints. The window display includes an arty manequin along with two regular ones and a chopper bike. You have no idea how many people ask if they can buy it. Can you SEE a forsale sign?! No. Funnily enough, it;'s not for sale.  Wow, this was the best idea i've ever had (and there have been many) This has passed the time quick as a flash! I was supossed to be going out in Eastbourne tonight but due to my Impetigo-provoked depression, i am going to be going home in ooh... fifteen minutes and run myself a long hot bath, make a hot chocolate, and read 'About a Boy' until the water goes cold. Then maybe to add to my saddness i'll watch the film too. Ah, welcome to my life. And remember, many a fox grows grey, but few grow good. Au revoir Tet xxxx
