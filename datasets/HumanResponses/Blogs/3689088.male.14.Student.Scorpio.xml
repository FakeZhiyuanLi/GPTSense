      I have no idea how the heck this thing's supposed to work, so I guess I'll improvise. As it stands I'm trying to figure this out, gimme a sec...  [25% done]  [50% done]  [75% done]  [100% done]  [125% done]  Okay, okay, I'll shut up now!!! *cowers in fear*  Anyway, I'm Justin, aka Arrow. I'm from Canada (and definately proud of it) so go away if you're the person who thinks that Canada's all about dogsleds, igloos, and maple syrup.   Interests:  Airplanes, ships, Finding Nemo, anything that moves on any surface except land, basically...and falcons. Oh, and writing on fictionpress.net, computer games (especially Final Fantasy)   Dislikes:  People who think that Canada's all about maple syrup, etc...popular, cocky people who think they're all so great when in reality they look like hobbits, things that are biological and affect me (meaning diseases, needles, etc...) There're more, but...then I'd have to kill you.  June 19, 20:00hrs  I'm currently in Hamilton, ON, running from crappy AOL dialup. Welcome to the world of dialup. Please wait while your modem initiates...*blasts the modem* Okay, done with that. More about me...as I said, I like falcons a lot. Especially  Falco Peregrinus  or Peregrine falcons. I made a sub-species of peregrines that have silver-coloured feathers under their wings. That silver gives them special abilities, mainly control over one of four SF (silver falcon) elements - fire, lightning, water, and ice. More advanced silver falcons can control wind as well, but I've yet to get there. XD  SFs are lead by a young falcon, the most powerful in the world, whose name is Scott. More on him in my fics. (www.fictionpress.net/~distantthunder)  Aside from falcons, I also like Finding nemo. Yep, that little kiddie movie that's actually pretty good. I joined an FN board and am a humble member...and it's my job (along with Chiuhiro's) to destroy as many flamer posts as possible. Naturally, I love my job. ^__^  Quite a relief to get away from school...or is it? My dad's thinking of enrolling me in summer camps...if it's one thing that you must know about me know, it's that I hate being social (except on the internet, where there's a little thing called a 'block' button ^_^) so it takes away from me spending time with Liana (my online girlfriend), my beloved FN board, and finally, my writing.  Chiuhiro was the one who started this whole 'blog' thing on the FN board, so I'll talk about her for a bit. She says that people go through different 'phases'. What I think she means is the colour of the walls in their bedrooms. Someone can go through a 'black phase' meaning all their stuff is black...well...I'm currently (and always have been...) in a 'blank phase'. XD  My favoured fics on Fictionpress.net is the Planeshift series. It starts out slow, but it's the best one I put up (according to reviewers and friends) so far. I just finished Planeshift II, and then I'll probably work a bit on Tempest...check my profile for more info on that.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - More on Silver Falcons (SFs) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Silver falcons are in fact a failed experiment created by Satan (yep, the Devil). They escaped from his lair and have retreated to the Earth. Often teased and forced to bear ridicule and slander by other falcons, silver falcons were considered the black sheeps of the falcons. They were, as such, forced to keep their silver feathers and their capabilities a secret. Generations passed, and came along Scott, a young silver falcon who inherited a large training centre for falcons to practice their flying, fighting, and hunting skills. However, when silver falcons were imprisoned in Satan's lair, some falcons remained behind, and those falcons (and their descendants) attacked Scott's centre. There, Scott and his fellow silver falcons were forced to reveal their secret - their silver feathers.  After a while, Scott managed to comandeer a large battleship comissioned by the dark silver falcons called the TCV Thunder. The  Thunder  was the silver falcon's mobile base until some falcons decided to leave the ship behind and start large aerial cities. The silver falcons have a strong military yet perfer to sort things out peacefully rather than resorting to violence. They will, however, engage dark silver falcons on sight.  Currently there're several weapons, craft, and silver abilities that are used by the SF military.  Craft SF/F-16SA 'Peregrine' - lightly armored but highly manoeuverable air-superiority craft. SF/B-16EA 'Gyrfalcon' - medium bomber with autolasers that help defend the main craft. SF/I-16OP 'Sakerfalcon' - long-range interceptor craft used to destroy craft at long range. Often used to destroy bombers. SF/A-16CE 'Lannerfalcon' - Anti-tank, slow moving light bomber. Weak against enemy air. SF/H-15AD 'Backdrop' - Heavy carpet bomber.  Popular abilities Silver falcons are trained to mostly improvise when using their elements in combat. Each silver falcon has a special ability that s/he uses whenever taken heavy damage. The ability varies on falcon to falcon. At higher levels, however, there're four extremely powerful attacks silver falcons can use at any time (though it requires a lot of energy), Aerovis Thundaris, Aerovis Frostavis, Aerovis Firavis, and Aerovis Hydrovis.  Notable silver falcons Scott - leader of the silver falcons on the aerial battleship TCV Thunder. Thunder element. Ariel - Scott's love. When together, their power becomes unbeatable. Ice element. Oliver - Scott's brother. Thunder element. Justin (me) - Scott's youngest brother. Captured when he was young and turned into a human whose name is Justin. As a silver falcon, his name is Arrow. Eric - Scott's best friend. Engineer. Fire element. Ayden - Justin/Arrow's best friend. Fire element.  Nationalities Scott, Oliver, & Justin - Canadian Ariel - American Ayden - Japanese Eric - Part Scottish, part South American  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Uh oh, better log off.

      June 20, about 22:00 hrs  Bad news is that my kewboard keeps cutting out on me. I have no idea what the heck's going on. Gosh I hate that keyboard...   Finally some good news. My friend Mike wrote the next chapter for his fiction, "The Signal". It's about a guy named Justin (not me) who manages to somehow get into heaven where he meets several personifications of various spirits, like Purity being a good or positive personification and Havoc being a bad one. It's turning out really well. You should read it, but I still have to ask Mike whether or not I should post the link here.  Next, I'm stuck on the next chapter to Tempest. I have no idea what the heck to write...probably 'cause I forgot it. Been too busy with exams and Planeshift II: Search & Destroy to do anything productive with Tempest.  Aurgh, this stupid thing isn't downloading. *smashes comp* Gosh I hate this thing...I dunno what's worse, a comp that won't even download or AOL...
