      This is my first time again....   As an author, I somehow like to think that my words would outlast me.  Therefore I really hope that my blogs here will not go the way of my previous four blogs...  This is my fifth attempt to maintain a "proper" blog.  All my previous blogs got lost due either to a crashed harddisk, a virus infection, a hacker attack on my website or a clumsy, beer-induced mouse-click on the wrong button... :-(   And I never bothered to backup.   That makes me feel like a lousy IT Consultant.  I keep evangelizing about the value of "backups" to my clients while I never even have a backup copy of my blogs.  I try to rationalize it by saying that *my* blogs are ramdom thoughts and do not really have value... except to me, or so I thought.    In all that time, there was only one recorded instance of somebody actually reading them.  He or she left a comment, and I remember it clearly: "don't worry about what others think. what matters here is what you think. if they have an opinion on anything, let them write their own comments. you have a grate[sic] potential and you seem very intelligent. keep it up."     At first, I didn't get what he or she meant, particularly about my "grate potential".  If I reference the Random House Webster's Dictionary, sounds like I can shred, mince or pulverize (which makes me feel powerful) or scrape, rasp, grind, rub, scratch, abrade, screech, scream, jangle, buzz, burr, clack (like a car fender on the curb...ouch) or chafe, jar, gnaw at, irritate, annoy, rankle, gall, irk, vex (like a rude insult...hehehe).  But then again, he or she probably meant I can "be noble" or "have a lofty character".  Hmmm.  That's probably it.  hehehe   ...And what's this about keeping it up?  IT'S always up... hehehe  But seriously, that one and only comment as well as his or her handle/profilename gave me another idea about a new blog I want to start or try.  In this blog, I'd like to write my thoughts and opinions from the point of view of my *shadow*.  So this is the only post in which I expect to write in the first-person.  I don't know if somebody has done this before, but I will certainly try it.  Let's see what happens.  So to *Alter-Ego*, wherever and whoever you are.  You have my gratitude. I wish that someday you visit this blog.    I sincerely hope that this is an auspicious beginning.  For as I start on this blog, tomorrow I start on my new job as an IT instructor, lecturer, trainor (or whatever they call it)...   Grate potential indeed!    :-)    Eldon  -----  ...
