       Jane Doe- a few hints in response to your letter...   A healthy relationship between friends is the kind where if they get into fights, they always find a way to recover. Unfortunately, we were unable to do so, and it ended the worst way a friendship can. I saw many things that went wrong through a period of two or three years, but didn't point out because I knew you wouldn't see it yourself. So now that you're asking, I will try to point them out to you to the best I can to answer your questions. If you do not understand them now, try your best, and if you follow these hints, then some day you will see.   1. You didn't come to the possible source of the problem first. If you have a problem with someone or you hear someone has a problem with you, go to them first. Don't tell your friends, because somehow it will make it's way to them, and that will probably just make things worse. Telling others before you get the courage to talk to the original source will create a 'telephone.' I'm sure you've heard of it, it's where everytime the news makes it to someone new, the story changes and makes the problem(s) worse. And never have a friend talk to the person, you should do it yourself to prove to the person that it really does matter to you and you want it to get settled as soon as possible.   2. Don't ever assume that someone doesn't know or understand how hurt you may feel. It may very well be their fault that you're feeling so shitty, but maybe that was their intention.   3. I am who I am. I usually have good people skills so I can pick and choose my friends. If I don't like what happens with someone, I don't stick around... unless they're worth it. If you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours... kick my ass my foot will be up yours. I stuck with you for two or three years, maybe more, so take it as a compliment.   4. I know i'm not the only person that's hurting in the world, I'm not that ignorant. Why else would I be involved in so much volunteer work? I'm also the youngest child in my family, it's natural for me to want attention.   Maybe "disgusted" wasn't the best word to use. Replace it with frustrated, or irritated.   I hope this last letter to you helped answer your questions. Use these tips, they will help in future relationships. I think about the way things used to be, too, when it was satisfying to both of us. Don't feel sorry anymore, what happened happened. It's time to just forget and move on.   Alli

       Writing in my journal, I never really thought I would get feedback, nor did I want any. And while writing, I now realize that all these words will be read by you, so I'm afraid to say what I really feel... because I don't want you to worry about me. So this is your warning. The contents of this journal are my deepest feelings, as dark, hateful, spiteful, bitter, and angry as they may be towards the world or any person imparticular. If you take offense to anything I write, then don't read it. I don't care. I don't want your sympathies, I don't want you to feel guilt... even though some people deserve that at the very least... I am thankful for the concern that some people have expressed, but I don't want it or need it at this point... I will not harm myself in any way. I know better than that.   I did my homework tonight, not all of it of course, but most of it. Then I gave in to the screaming, spoiled, fingernails-on-a-chalkboard annoying child inside my head and had a (small) piece of cake. *shame*   It's difficult to write how I feel when what I think is even impacted by I affect other people... in a way that is a good thing, but not when I can't even have my own thoughts without feeling shame.   Today is only Tuesday and it feels like it should be Friday. I don't want to go to school anymore. It used to be something I was excited about... corny as it may sound... I hated weekends even, because that usually meant that I wouldn't see my friends for a whole two days. *sigh* That's what people do to you. Now I'm trying to think of a good simile that I could use for that... but nothing comes to mind. Maybe Salmon? Yeah... salmon... because they try so hard to get to where they know they want to be, but all the greedy poaching fishermen take all the salmon. So pretty soon, all the bears taht relied on those salmon will either die or eat the fishermen in revolt. Then the bears will be shot for eating the fishermen. And then all that's left are the fishermen with no more fish.   Maybe that wasn't the best example. I'm too tired to tell.

       I just finished my writing basic skills test. The topic was "If you could live anywhere, where would you live?" I think it's a stupid question, why would I only want to live in one place? What if I move there and hate it, or there's a change of plans or dreams? What if I have a mid-life crisis or something? Stupid people... I wrote about Scotland. It took me 20 minutes to even think about a topic, then I couldn't decide between San Diego, California, staying in Minnesota, or Scotland. When the teacher told everyone to start, I was the only person who didn't start writing. I know I'm not the only one who feels like this... like I don't know what I want to do, or I feel lost, but why does it always seem like it?  I know I could have done better, but I hate the topic, it's too restricted...  Now I'm bored... and hungry.   I hate forwards. I hate the people who send them more. So I asked the person NICELY to stop, and they automatically assume I'm having an attitude at them. Makes me laugh. I'm so sick of their bullshit all I can do is laugh anymore... even though inside I'm crying. Burn in hell. I wanted to scream at them at the top of my lungs, and shake them until they screamed so hard that their voicebox broke inside their throat, choking them in their own blood... I can hear the gurgling of saliva and blood now... and they closed their eyes so hard that their eyes popped into the back of their head. Kind of disturbing... makes me laugh, even though I hate feeling this way.

       Sitting in bed... awake... as usual. Had an overall decent day. Then I came home... sat around some more... then cried. No matter how good of a day I have, something always reminds me and it tears me down. They always haunt me. My insecurities about everything find a way to take control of me, until I lose complete control. I tried cutting tonight for the first time, obviously it didn't work because I'm here to type this the next day. The blade was too dull. I can still feel and see the red scratch marks burning. It feels good. Now I understand why cutters, well, cut. At the same time, I feel ashamed for even trying it. I feel like a hypocrite, for always judging those who cut because they couldn't take it... and now I try it. And worse- I like it.   I'm sick of feeling all this hate toward everyone. Why can't it just go away. I try every way possible to cut off contact with them because I don't want to say anything wrong to them, and then I actually tried to make things better by standing up for them, and I get cut down again. When will they realize how much it really hurts... they do know, they just don't care enough to change. Why should they change, anyway. They have the artificial highschool relationships who they can hold hands with and cuddle with in the halls. Then they have their best friends to gossip with, and have sleepover with so they can paint their nails and watch chick flicks and dye their hair pretty colors, or go get a fake orange-looking tan. Why do I even want to be apart of that?   Why don't I ever belong anywhere? Whenever I begin to feel better, the bitter taste of insecurity and lack of self confidence builds up again, as some kind of harsh reminder that I should never be happy. I hope they burn in hell for doing this to me.

       I'm sick of feeling like this.  I'm sick of my mom telling me the shit she does to try to get me to feel better, when I already know everything she's suggesting.  I'm sick of my sister, who I hate (at most times) with every fiber in my body.  I'm sick of being told to forget her, but I can't when she's sleeping in the next room, or walking all over me telling me how disgusting and worthless I am.  She's a waste of my could-have-been college tuition.  She's a liar, and a selfish fuck.  I'm sick of trying to fix it and make our relationship better.  I give up.  I won't... I can't take this shit anymore.  I'm sick of my mom thinking my threats at leaving are empty, even as I scream them at her with tears rolling down my cheeks.  She refuses to recognize the problem, and I continue to suffer because of it.  I won't continue with these empty threats forever, I have other places I can go.       Someday soon I will break... and it will be too late for anyone to help.

       I feel so lost and confused on this damned roller coaster ride.  I'm sick of being told how I should feel and how I should or shouldn't think.  I'm sick of inconsiderate bastards who are too wrapped up in their own fucking worlds to give a damn about anyone else.  I'm sick of selfish, snotty bitches who just like to create their own sitcoms and 'reality shows' or day-time dramas.  I'm sick of trying to wina lost cause.  I'm sick of living in a world that just... sucks.  All I feel is hate and anger.  I can't take the accusations and all the judgements and the grudges from past complications anymore.  What the hell is the point anyway?  We'll all die someday.  Then I begin to wish that some die sooner than others.  Then the other side of me that actually listens and cares about other people and self-image tells me I shouldn't think like that.  Where the fuck am I supposed to go?  My mom gave me an assignment that I'm supposed to do.  Write down at least 10 things why you still want to live.    1. Sam and Oscar    2. my select few friends    3. battlefield (how pathetic is that?)((hey, whatever tickles your pickle))    4. the good CSI episodes, as rare as they are    5.

       Want to vegetate.  Want to meditate. "Time to feed the monster."  Girls with their tacky hair.  Gross highlights.  Showing how truly shallow they are.  Painted faces.  Orange, dried complexions in the middle of winter, see how much time they have to spend in the tanning beds.  Colored contacts, hiding their true depth perception.  Underweight... or overweight.  Fake.  Why the disguise?  What are they hiding from?  What's the point when everyone knows it's not the true 'them'?  Shallow, attention craving whores.   You're a stranger So what do I care? You vanish today Not the first time I hear All the lies  -perfect circle, A Stranger

       Stuck at a Knowledge Bowl tournament. Sitting in the caffeteria... Alone. Looking around, I see empty chairs, empty tables. Belongings strewn around, across tables, on chairs, thrown carelessly on the floor... like my life it seems. Stepped on. Walked on. Everyhing representing someone else. So many empty chairs. So many empty people. What represents me? Who the hell are they to judge me?  Then... who am I to judge them? What's my 'scene'? I don't have one. What's my stereotype? I'm not one. Who the fuck am I?  I don't dress one way... not goth, not punk, nor prep nor geek. I'm a blend... but never happy with any... never comfortable.  I don't have a best friend. So if I can't find one, I'll make one. My journal will have to do... and possibly you'll become a friend though it, indirectly.  Emptiness, lonliness, destruction, hatred, jealousy, bitterness. I just want to break down. I'm too afraid someone I know will see.  I find anger and hate and ugliness in everything. The only things that give me pleasure are drawing, which I'm not even good at. I waste my life on the computer... which my parents don't approve of. How surprising.  Writing gets old. My arm hurts. I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up. Joy in nothing.  "Talking to yourself again. Suicidal imbecile. Think about it, put it on the faultline. What'll it take to get it through to you precious over this. Why do you wanna throw it away like this. Such a mess. I dont wanna watch you"  I know that disconnecting myself from everyone isn't helping. I'm just sick of not belonging... never feel right with anyone. So I sit and read Time and Newsweek and science books by myself, saying hello to passerby every once in awhile... thinking what it might be like to be their best friend... a good friend. I wish I had one... Slit my wrists and hope to die, stick a needle in my eye.

       "Smile and drop the cliche."   Tears welling behind eyelids close. A perfect circle - spinning round. Visions of a record spinning endlessly. Never ceasing circular motion. Guitars. Drums. Bass. Words telling a story. Words to hide in... words to confide in.  Eyes shifting, untrusting. Who are these people? They are not me. They are no one. Visions of a world soon to be gone.

       "All I wanted was a little love to take the pain away."  Numb mind. Too early. Still numb from late night - bad thoughts - horrid dreams. I hate - this - here. Wish I was home... in bed. Sleeping a dreamless night. Suspicions. Burning crosses. Dead faith that never existed in the first place. A perfect circle spinning round and roun like a broken record in my head. Spinning. Merry-go-round... memories. Sounds of a distant radio, exploding in someone's ears. Echoes of laughter. Disturbances. Interuptions.

       Laying in bed, trying to figure out all of these thoughts flowing through my head. They go too fast. I can't hold onto one thought for more than a second. How am I writing this? I'm almost writing this subconsciously. Thoughts pouring - can't focus. Starts with Soco song I'm tuning out to - school - hate - anger - razor blades - blood. Walking on razor blades. Drawn in anime. Girl - beautiful - long, brown wavy hair. Running... from what? Bandages colored a deep red covering her arms. Thinking of a title... to name this... blurred visions. "It's not what it seems. Nothing's the same when you give it away." Soco... playing... "This family's breaking down and it's not what it seems." Hate - Anger. Running again. WHAT IS SHE RUNNING FROM?! Tears. Pouring... like my thoughts - my dreams - my hate - my anger - my jealousy. Beauty. Painted nails - deep, blood red. "Now she's shutting down."  Where did it start? Why can't I have any good memories? Memories full of anger. Bitter rivalry. Jealousy. Hate. Destruction. Plates falling, breaking into pieces, shattered. Slamming doors with gaping holes. Anger forming words... yelling. Jealousy. Betrayal. Hate. Bad habits. Imperfections. Mine. Hers. Theirs. Uncontrollable. "Nothing's the same when you give it away."  The lines... creases... in my hands. The holes. The pores. Blood seeping out, dripping to the floor. Puddles staining the floor. Lines. Jealousy.  What do they tell you? Split ends. Hair pulled by the roots. Same song... repeating... revealing the story that I can't find the words to tell. Can't filter the thoughts. "And now she's shutting down." Disapproval. Jealousy. Competition. Anger. Disposable babies. Texture of the walls, skin, the paper, the pores. YOU'RE A WASTE OF ROTTING HUMAN FLESH! Emotions burning holes inside out. Pain of the touch... unforgiven. YOU'RE A FAT WHORE! Abuse... slaps... pushing... kicking... hitting... The hate. The anger. Building. Overworked. Tears burning the flesh from the bones. Erosion. BULLSHIT! Feel the blood drip... splatter on the floor. Imagine the ripple. "This family's breaking down." No support system... falling apart. Hate. Anger. Telephone ringing. Wrong number. Always wrong number. Prank calls - accidental calls. Hear their laughs... laughing at me. Hello? They don't hear you. - no one hears you. Thunder. No one. No response. "And now she's shutting down." Distant colors. Uncontrollable thoughts. Rambling. Everything at once. Feel the cold blade against the skin. Gently. Ravaging. Hemorrhage. Jealousy. Cutting me apart. Drive. Just drive. Mountains. Sun. Stars... visible at the same time. The moon falls. Ripples across the surface of the exploding earth. Thoughts pouring.   Blurred visions.

       Well, today I wasn't so mute.  I just was a little more quiet than usual.  I guess I'm lucky that Mr Pellant hasn't assigned a seating chart, yet, for me yelling at him yesterday for not letting me sit where I want.  Here's the story.  I was working, like I usually do, but Amanda was talking to Alicia, and Amanda is the only reason I sit where I do (we can pick our seats).  So I moved over to sit next to Brad and Bez, but Pellant starting saying that I couldnt sit there, saying I would be too much of a distraction.  Not like they do their fucking work anyway!!!  So then I yelled at him, and he said he'd make assigned seats.  Then Keri Dowzak started bitching (like she usually does), so she now obviously hates me.  Good.  My appointment today was boring.  My mom came in with me and we yelled at each other about how we see our relationships with Ellie and who was right and who was wrong.  I say we just make her move out and problem solved.  Too bad we can't do that.  We also went over what could be the cause of my horrible mood swings.  They keep asking me if it's my mom's breast cancer a year ago, why would that have anything to do with it?  Just lots of stupid things like that.  I got Wendy's afterwards :)  My frosty made everyone jealous.  I fell asleep in science twice today.  Eric kept touching my shoulder to keep me awake.  Ass. :(  I'm in a bad mood again... I think I'm going to go take a nap

       Woke up this mornin around three to Razz trying to get the fish out of its tank.  That was a pain in the ass to clean up after.  Pretty funny though... until she started eating my plant again.  What a snob.  Today was overall pretty relaxing for a Sunday, did some homework, got in another fight with my sister.  Nothing unusual.  Ellie is a bitch... but most of you know that.  She worked all day yesterday, came home around 10, then went out partying for awhile I guess, she still wasn't home when I went to bed at 1.  Then she slept in until 4, then I woke her up.  I left her a message on her mirror to clean her side of the sink and walk the dogs.  Of course she doesn't walk the dogs... so we got in a fight about that, with her ending up slamming my door shut, yet again breaking the brand new doors that my dad installed on his few hours off every week.  *sigh*  Fighting for a lost cause...

       Today I watched a really cool thing on MTV, Choose or Lose about gay marriage and the different people who oppose it or support it.  I learned that more than half of the young population, I think it was even 70% isn't against some kind of civil union.  If only we could vote, we would make a difference.   All I want in life's a little bit of love To take the pain away Getting strong today A giant step each day All I want in life's a little bit of love To take the pain away Getting strong today A giamt step each day I've been told Only fools rush in Only fools rush in But I don't believe I don't believe I could still fall in love with you   I will love you till I die And I will love you all the time So please put your sweet hand in mine And float in space and drift in time All the time until I die We'll float in space, just you and I And I will love you till I die And I will love you all the time So please put your sweet hand in mine And float in space and drift in time All the time until I die We'll float in space, just you and I   Baby I love you today I guess that's what you want And I don't know where we are all going Life don't get stranger than this It is what it is And I don't know where we are all going   I will love you till I die And I will love you all the time Everything happens today And we're out here in space And I don't know where we are all going Baby I love you today I guess that's what you want  And I don't know where we are all going   Spiritualized "Ladies and Gentlemen We're Floating in Space"  During the show, they said that all anyone needs to do to get more support, is to just talk to one friend.  And it made me realize that I am actually helping, whether I realize it or not, whether I impact   everyone   or not.  I   can   make a difference.

       The weather certainly matched my mood today.  Dark, dampened spirit.  Uncomfortable, humid, diskliked by most.  Amanda was gone today, sick with Bronch or something... poor kid.  She had better get back to soon, though, she's gonna have a hell of a hard time catching up.  I got threatened by Lance in English that he was going to give me a wet willy... but not the tongue kind of wet willy.  I wanted to scream they're so immature.  Science was what ruined my whole day.  I was talking to a few kids that I sat near about the ban on Gay marriage and how it's discriminatory and wrong, and it sounds to me like we're back in the 50's and 60's discriminating against African Americans.  One girl, who I used to respect because she's a really good student, even said that men and women only get married to have children, and since homosexuals can't have children, they shouldn't have the right to get married.  I wanted to slap her across the face.  Then two other guys went on about how it was just wrong and disgusting, and how 'fags' shouldn't be around them.  It seemed that no matter what good support I gave, they refused to listen... I was wrong, no matter what.  I at least have the understanding that people may be against it, but they still have no right to limit other people's civil rights that are guaranteed to them as American citizens.  If we start taking away good people's rights, what will be next?  Will we start taking away our freedom of speech rights?  Freedom of assembly?  Many people are opposed to it because of their religion,   but that is precisely why the Church is separated from the government.    I give up for now.

       Today Amanda was gone from school.  Math was very boring without her, so was English and Science.  I've been lucky that she's been in almost half of my classes all three trimesters this year.  We decided that we're both more mature than other students at school... anyone could have agreed with that, though.  English was kind of disgusting today... since Amanda was gone, the only people there to talk to were the kids behind us, and all they like to talk about is giving each other blow-jobs and drawing dicks on each others hands.  That got boring quick.  Mr. Pellant assigned a somewhat-cool speech, we have to give one on a special occasion.  I think I'll choose a eulogy, since everyone thinks I'm good with death anyway.  I'm going to give one on my kaputt cat Sammy, since I kinda feel bad that I've never really given her a proper farewell.  I hope she's listening.  Razz is doing well, she's still got a horrible cold and has sneezing fits every few minutes, but she's getting her appetite back and is starting to explore my mom's closet.  She still isn't quite used to the barking of the dogs, or Oscar, but Oscar watched her a little more today.  Every day is another step.  I stayed after to work on my art project that I need to get caught up on, and I talked with Mr. Mittelstedt about Mrs. Waller, and how she emails everyone but him, he assumes she doesn't email him because she didn't get his job when he was supposed to retire last spring.  So I helped him write an email to her, asking how she's doing, etc etc.   Mr. M is pretty cool, he liked the dredlocks I made on my little statue made out of plaster.  I'm excited to see if my "Lonely Disease" piece gets into the Top 100 Show, I'm still pretty proud of actually doing something that looks that great.  My dad was angry with me earlier this evening, because of some crazy shit that's been going on with my sister and I regarding the Gummi Bears that Jess gave me for a Christmas present... since she was the last person I saw eating them, when I found the bag open and all of the Gummi's rotten, I assumed it was her, and I asked her to replace the bag... of course she said no, so we got in an argument, to find out later that it was my mother that ate the gummi's.  ::sigh::  I laughed when I was explaining it to my sister, she yelled of course.  Today was very (otherwise) relaxing.  I played some BFV (as usual), played with Razz and Oscar, and that's about it.  I had a good piece of ice cream cake.   I love cake.

       Today was a half decent day.  I woke up to Razz sleeping on her little perch by the window that I installed Saturday.  Her deep breaths made a rattling sound deep in her throat as she tried to breathe in through her clogged nose.  Poor kitty with a cold.  I then took a shower, and went through my morning routine half awake.  Then drove to school, and walked 5-10 minutes to the school from the Community parking lot up the hill.  I started my new class today, Survey Art C.  I'm glad I was able to switch from that shit dance class, except when I learn from Courtney that they made new rules stating that you need at least three trimesters of Performing Arts.  What total bullshit.  I want to take the kind of classes that interest me, not what my peers want me to take.  They don't know me, and don't know where I want to go or where I am going in life.  And I can tell you, dance classes will not change my outlook on who I want to be.  Then I went to second hour Math, to have to get shit from my recently-married teacher.  What a grouch.  Then my shit third hour History, where I know very few people and the rest are vainglorious and annoying as all hell.  I have to say that my worst class today had to be Math, though.  I was talking to JT, who just happens to be another Democrat (woo!) and we have lots of good conversations regarding Bush and his shit administration.  While we were discussing our political beliefs, Lance kept making moronic comments and mocking us.  He would say that Bush was great, but he never had anything to back up his opinion.  So JT and I would inform him of what his faults are, and he'd continue to be thick, saying that Bush was the best.  All I can do anymore is shake my head in frustration and mumble under my breath, "Don't you love our generation?" ::rolls eyes::  I'm not entirely against anyone who might support Bush, because people have rights to their own opinions, just as much as I have my right to support Kerry.  What bothers me most is when kids my own age laugh about it and say that Bush is the best, and that the war in Iraq is 'totally awesome,' or they even go as far as to mock Iraqis and people of Middle Eastern cultures and run around in circles screaming about bombs.  It's disgusting, and I fear for when these people will be holding higher offices in our future, making our decisions on whether we go to war or not, and what is important to the true American society.  Makes you think, doesn't it?   ::sigh:: Don't you love our generation?   Here's a fun activity that will only take a minute or two.    Go to www.google.com, type in 'miserable failure,' then click 'I feel lucky'    See what happens!

       I just finished adding all of my old posts to my site.  That took awhile.  Reading through them made me a little irritated with myself for not writing more often, especially this past week or two.  I guess I'll try to sum it all up now.  Yesterday marked the one week anniversary of owning Razz, my new cat.  She was adopted to help fill the hole of my deceased, beloved cat Sammy, who died about two weeks ago.  She was the best cat I could ever have, I've had her since I was about 3 or 4.  It was really difficult to let her go, her death was so sudden that I wasn't able to control my feelings.  I guess it's better that I waited to write.  Oscar is lonely without Sam, and is craving attention.  He's slowly warming up to the new invader, I wish the dogs would warm up just as fast.  They scared the shit out of her the other day when trying to introduce them, now she's ended up with URI, or upper respiratory infection (almost like a cat cold), and refuses to eat.  She sneezes all night and you can hear the mucus bubbles inside her throat while she tries to breathe, yet the doctors say she'll be fine in a week or two.  Poor kitty.  She's slowly warming up to her new environments, and now she doesn't hide under the bed every time someone walks into the room.  So she's improving.  One of my fishes also died.  Two death's in one weekend, oh well, didn't like the fish much anyway.  Battlefield Vietnam came out the other day.  I don't like it as much as I was hoping I would, but I just need to get used to flying helicopters and the M60's.  While I was playing today, my sister came in the room and turned on the lights, then started fucking around opening desk drawers and shit like that, and the light created an annoying glare against the computer screen, so I asked her to go somewhere else.  She refused, so when she left and came in a second time, I asked her to fucking go somewhere else.  So instead of saying no, or just being a little mature and actually leaving to the kitchen or what not, she screams as loud as she fucking can in my ear and throws a pair of sunglasses at me.  Thus proving the fact that she is the sole reason I have poor hearing, headaches usually only on the weekends, and gives me even more reason to hate her.  I should have broken her nose when she leaned over to scream in my ear, oh well, maybe next time.  I've had headaches all weekend.  She didn't make them any better.  No wonder her (ex)roommate in college hated her.  She's impossible to get along with.

       Wow.  It's been awhile since I've written anything again.  I need more time in my day.  Everyone does.  Shitty pen.  Anyway. I finished my reading test about 10 minutes ago.  Now I have another hour and 50 minutes to sit here.  What a waste.  The new trimester sucks.  I have a dance class first hour, I hate dance.  Why did I even sign up for it?  I'd rather be in art.  I asked my school counselor if I could switch, but nooooo.  So basically, I have to take a class that I...    1. don't like or have no interest in doing    2. I will probably fail anyway I hate this school, and the counselors who think they have all the answers and can tell who I am just by the grades I get or the way I act or the clothes I wear or by the problems I have, that they don't know about.  Why is it that whenever I talk to a counselor or psychiatrist about my mom having breast cancer, they assume it's the reason I'm so angry or worried?  To tell you the truth, it didn't really affect me. They assume that because Ellie is having her problems and issues and now she takes them out on me, i'm just concerned about her.  Bullshit.  Hey Ellie, are you reading this?  THEY'RE WRONG!  I don't give a rat's ass about you anymore.  You've completely fucked me over, blamed me for all of your problems and for intruding in on your life 15 years and 1 month ago.  But I don't give a shit about you anymore.  The only good things that come out of having you as a sibling is music, computer programs and movies, clothes, and occasionally some use of the makeup you leave sitting on the counter when you're home.  You have no emotional effect on me anymore.  Your feelings don't influence me, I just don't care.  You're selfish, inconsiderate, egotistic, and just a pain in the ass.  You ruin my day every time you're home.  You wake me up in the middle of the fucking night, and why? just so you can have the fucking TV to play your Xbox.  And to the parents, my educations isn't as important as a way for you to get to work, when Galaxie House is less than two fucking miles away.  You ruin everything, and you never give a shit.  And I hate having to change my entire daily schedule, my entire LIFE just to suit yours.  You're a lazy ass slob, who can't even put toilet paper on the roll.  And you say you clean up after my messes?  Bullshit.  Go to hell and don't even say you're in hell,  because even I could make your miserable self-indulgent world hella worse.   I'm done for now.

       Bored after finishing my finals.  It's been awhile since I've written anything, so why not now? Last night I really wanted to write, but I was too tired.  Now I can't remember what I wanted to write. Everyone is expecting too much from me right now.  They don't understand that I can't deal with everything, I can't deal with all of their problems.  I need my space.  I don't have the mental capacity to handle everything.  I hear from (name deleted) that (name deleted) is upset with me because I broke off our plans.  What bothers me, is that I told him from the very beginning that I didn't know if the plans would work out in the first place.  What the hell am I supposed to do about it?  Too many appointments, too many thoughts twisting through my head, too little concentration, too many people, too little time.    They don't understand.  Tyrells says he's been where I am before, obviously not, because he's still telling me that I shouldn't ditch my friends.  I tell them that I just need some time to be a lone, yet they still have these high expectations.  Well, too fucking bad.  I need to think of myself for once, and I'm not going to let them take control of my life and tell me what I'm doing is wrong.  You are not me, you do not see things the same way I do.  So fuck off. I need a new pen.  This one is annoying.  God damnit.  I can't even think of what to write.  It's challenging to keep my mind focused on one thing.  Everything is spinning around in my head.  Cyclones... blenders.... chopping up my thoughts, hopes, and dreams.  This was a good morning.  Four people said hello to me in the hall.  It made me want to skip.  So I did.

       Just finished filling out another packet about myself for my new doctor.  Another list of checkmarks, another stereotype, another prescription, another bottle of little white or light blue tablets that say do not use with alcohol, another failure. Still the thoughts remain, the grudges, the anger, the pain, the tears, the heartbreak.  I want the voices whispering in my ears to stop.  I don't want to listen anymore Having a hard time even keeping my eyes open.  Perfect circle has this effect on me.  I have nothing left to write at this point.  -fin-

       I drove to Petco today to buy cat food.  It felt good to actually have something useful to do.  Then I drove to Best buy and bought the Donnie Darko (excellent movie) soundtrack with the gift card Elizabeth Anderson got me for my birthday.  (Thanks Lizard)  I love it.  Taking a left at the stoplight that takes 5 minutes to change, the sign in front of me was mirroring the flashing turn signal from my car and the three behind me.  It was captivating.  While listening to the Donnie Darko soundtrack that I bought today, I completely zoned out.  It's hard for me to stay focused when driving at night... kinda scary.  All of the lights are so cool to look at... so mesmerizing.  I went to Steph and Jess's softball game today, to skip it with Rachel and go to the track meet instead to check out the hot guys.  There were a lot.  Then we went to the Burnsville mall to shop for some khaki pants and red shirts that I need for my new job at Targay... and there were more hot guys.  Then I realized how pathetically lonely I am.  Here I am, talking trash about this asshole rich preppy fucker who hit on me while he has a girlfriend... and all I'm doing is gawking at every hot guy that walks by me.  After being "single" for awhile now, and trying to ignore the hormonal shit that comes with being a teen,  I realize....  I need a significant other.

       Wow.  It's been awhile since I've written anything... and surprisingly, many things have happened.  I took my drivers test yesterday, and passed.  :)  I'm happy now because I also get to have the car for the rest of the school year because my sister won't need to bring it back to college with her.  Now I can stay after school as long as I want without having to worry about a ride.  I don't even need to leave for school until I'm ready now.  Yay.  My sister and I got along well this weekend.  We exchanged sweaters, and she even got a tattoo.  It's a cool asian-style elephant (to go with her childhood nickname) on the back of her left shoulder.  It looks really good.  Maybe when I'm older I might get a small tattoo of an Alligator.  :)  Probably not.  I got angry when I found out she took my Lucky perfume to college with her, when I needed it for a job interview.  My parents and I both agree that even if she only used a little, she will have to pay a dollar amount back to me.  Seems like some family issues are finally being handled in the right way and not just ignored by my parents and dumped onto me.  The cat is still recovering from her front claw removal... it didn't help when I accidentally stepped on her paw when she was running under my feet for food.  Damn that cat can scream.  I felt bad, even thought it was kinda funny to see the look on her face.  I'm waiting for a call from Marri, the human resources lady from Target, to call me back about my third interview thing tonight.  I really hope I get a job... I really need one.  I need to start paying for gas money, even though Ellie never had to pay for gas money for about a year when she got her license.  Oh well.  I need to start saving up for my trip to Costa Rica next year for SES.  I can't wait to get there.  I can tell my new meds are working, not by the nausea or the stomach aches or the headaches, but I think my mood is getting better.  I'm able to deal with people a little better and not get so angry with them.    I am still a little puzzled at a few people, though.  They were stupid enough to bring alcohol (mixed in with orange juice) to school and drink it.  They ended up getting caught of course, then getting suspended for four days.  I think I should stop calling them stupid ass mother fuckers in the hall though, I think they're getting angry at that.  I think I should just let them make their own decisions.  They are my friends, but hey, it's none of my business so I'm officially out of it.  I really need to update this stupid template... I don't like it very much even though it's my design.... I just can't find any good programs or websites to use.  They all have their plusses and minuses.  :'(  ::tear::

       :: sigh ::  It's hard to breathe with all this brownie and whipped cream in my tummy from the cake/brownie Steph brought over last night.  She "un"fortunately knows how to cheer me up... but it makes me feel fat.  :(   Oh well.  Jess gave me a nice candle today... which I really REALLY needed because it smells good and it can hide the smelly kitty litter odor.  And a cool picture frame that I don't have any pics to put in.  Then Chelsea gave me a cool birthday drawing of a cute guy.   :)   She can draw awesome pics.  Scott: i came home and ate m&ms notsohotchick911: i ate a brownie cake Scott: brownie cake eh notsohotchick911: yeah notsohotchick911: it's really good Scott: how can it be both? Scott: it hasta be more  one than the other notsohotchick911: okay fine, they're brownies with a big pile of chocolate whipped cream in the middle and chocolate chips that you dip the lil brownie pieces in notsohotchick911: i didnt get a birthday cake so IT'S A CAKE Scott: lol Scott: brownies are better than cake anyways notsohotchick911: yes they are :-) Scott: its condensed cake notsohotchick911: lol Scott: yep   So yeah... I put that in there 'cos I was bored.  I still am.  Today I was falling asleep in science as usual and I started thinking about all this bacteria stuff we're going over since I'm into this kind of stuff, and I thought that if a virus needed a host to reproduce... what makes us any different?   Maybe ... it's like the Matrix kind of.  Our thoughts aren't in our bodies... maybe we're just hosting the bodies and reproducing?  Does that make any sense?  I doubt it... even now that I'm thinking about I have no idea what I was thinking... or wasn't thinking?   My head is numb again...

       Woo!  It's my 16th birthday and (surprisingly) today was a pretty good day.  Amanda was a lifesaver and brought me the coolest gift ever.  :)  She made an awesome photoalbum dealio with cool stuff and inside jokes.  And she gave me candy (which I love) and more bracelets and a jewelry box.  Jessica O. gave me a great card, and so did Harshita.  :)  People gave me hugs, too.    I got a few checks from family that I'm going to put in savings for my trip to Belize.  Now dad is yelling at me about a stupid dinner thing.  This is my english speech:  	 My fellow citizens.  Today is the day that will change all days in America's future.  I am honored to stand in front of you and to accept this role to change our nation for the better.  Yesterday, the American flag stood for freedom and civil rights.  Tomorrow, it will stand for terror, injustice, inhumanity towards minority groups, and chaos.  This process, though it seems long, will take less than four years.  I will begin by making up lies about fellow presidential candidates. I will not provide the facts.  I will hack into the electronic voting machines, rigging the voting system that was once treasured and valued as a democracy. I will do anything to ensure I win.  After my election, I will pass laws that take away the rights of minority groups or ban them from their civil rights altogether.  I will let my views of the church interfere with my role as President. I will ignore the separation of Church and State, and ban human beings from marriage or their civil rights.  I will weaken laws that protect the environment and safety of every individual in this country, eventually impacting the whole world.  I will reward companies who send jobs overseas, when the unemployment rate is still struggling to recover. I increase government spending so that the country will be in a $480 billion deficit by the end of the year so that future generations will have to pay it off.  I will lower taxes for the rich, and raise taxes for the middle and lower class.  I will sign laws that allow corporations to confidentially report their mistakes and have their fines waived.  I will allow millions and millions of pounds of airborne toxins to be released into Texas, resulting in unhealthy living conditions for millions of people, and still claiming that "the air in Texas is cleaner."  I will plant false information about other countries and mislead the American people that war is the only way to settle foreign affairs.  I will allow hundreds of American soldiers and civilians to die fighting a war caused by my lies and deceit. I will weaken America's ties to the allies by going against the wishes and causing more war that will only benefit myself.  I will foster ignorance in the American people, who will be too blind in their patriotism to question me.  I am George W. Bush, and I want you to vote for me in the election of 2004.  While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country.    We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.	   "Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives."  "We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent. And we will reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans."  These exact words were said by George W. Bush in his inauguration on Saturday, January 20th, 2001.  Many of the things that Bush has promised us have not yet materialized.  We are still waiting for our schools to better and the lives of American people to improve.  Yet many of us still do not question him, do not ask him why.  It is time to see behind the mask, and to see what really lies in the heart of our president, George W. Bush.   I had to give my english speech today, it wasn't that bad except for when kids in my class finally understood what I was talking about, a few kids started saying shit to me... one kid told me to shut up and sit down even.  How fucking rude.  Anyway... I'm hungry so I'm hopefully going to Buca's tonight for dinner.  :)  I want spaghetti.

       Just got back from school because I had another anxiety attack during English class. Today sucked. Tomorrow had better treat me right.  Yesterday I went to frisbee which was great fun... then I got smacked in the head by another guy's head leaving me temporarily brain dead. It hurt... but I didn't cry or whine about it. It was really embarassing, everyone was paying attention to me and trying to make sure I was okay and they wouldn't let me lie down in case I had a concussion. I just wanted to sleep, but I guess that was the effects of the hit on my head. Now there's a bump there that really hurts. Afterwards I went out to get pizza with Cari, Jessica, Kim and Jake. I hope next week is better.  My first few classes were the usual... boring and uneventful. I got to fourth hour gym and realized I had forgotten the keys to unlock my locker at home, so I had to borrow a pair of Courtney's ugly-as-all-hell track pants. She doesn't like them either, so I can trash talk them. But yeah... they sucked. Then I tried climbing this wall and it fucking sucked. I gave up.  Fifth hour German was boring boring boring, then we went to lunch and the fucking lunch ladies wouldnt let me get a lunch because I would have been 45 cents in the hole. 45 FUCKING CENTS. What a big fucking deal. I asked if i could PLEASE bring money tomorrow because I was starving and it was only 45 cents... nooooooo. Asshats. So that made me really mad and set me off. Then I went to sit down but I couldn't find anyone that I sat with and different people were there, so I sat at an empty table until the usual kids came and sat down. By then I was nearly in tears just from being so frustrated. Jessica offered me her 5 dollar bill, but I declined. I was so angry with the lunch ladies I lost my appetite.  I got back to German, finished the class and left for English. When I sat down in English, a few people were talking and asking the teacher questions about the speeches that I thought were later in the week, turns out they were today. That's when I lost it. I had worked on a whole fucking outline the night before because when I asked someone if the speeches were today they said no, just an outline was due. They were wrong, and I was unprepared. I got so frustrated that I just couldn't take it anymore. Thank God I had Mr. Pellant first trimester because he already had some experience with my anxiety attacks so he let me go to the nurse without question. I called for a ride home, and my dad said he'd be there in 10-15 minutes because he was in the middle of something.  IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING??? He had just talked to the nurse who had told him I was having an anxiety attack/nervous breakdown, and I had just talked to him while crying my eyes out... great to know what his top priorities are. Then he asks me to tell him whats wrong. I don't want to fucking tell him what's wrong. Everything is pissing me off... I'm reacting to every little thing, and the fact that he had to 'finish something up' before coming to get his mentally distressed daughter at school didn't help. I'm sick of people.  I wonder if anyone will fucking remember that my birthday is tomorrow... unless they read this or they were there when I was screaming at everyone about how my week sucked. I'm ashamed for who I am and I never want to go back to school.

       Woo.  I think this template is finally finished!  Maybe not finished... but I'm not going to work on it anymore.  Anyway.  Last night I had a little birthday bash thing that was last minute, I'm suprised at the number of people who actually showed up.  Lizbeth came... so did Peter and Jessica and Kimmy and Micah and Ertl and Andy M. and Rachel.  It was fun.  We went to the park and played a little frisbee.  Then came back and ate some cake because we couldn't see the frisbee in the dark anyway.  Woo!  Frisbee is in an hour!  I have to get ready!

       Dinner tonight was really good, except for the many times my sister would mention the things she could or couldn't eat and the car 'conversation.'  Again we got on the topic of how we would settle the car arrangements, and my parents changed their story yet again.  Instead of us switching back and forth where I'd get the car one week and she'd get it two weeks or something like that, they were talking about how she'd get the car until her school was done... which is in late May.  I objected, asking why I couldn't get the car one week and she could get it for two weeks in a row and we'd just drive here to college... as usual, my parents made my idea sound like shit, so they're probably going to let Ellie drive the car whenever she wants, which is probably how it'll be during the summer, too.  I then learned that Ellie was on the Atkins' diet, which I think is absurd because she appears to be very healthy, she's normal weight for her tall stature and she usually eats correctly anyway.  So I said that I thought it was stupid that she was on the diet, and of course she takes it the wrong way by shoving how 'large' I am down my throat, how I'm already the same pants size as her, etc etc.  So now I'm locked in my room crying as usual, thanks to Ellie and her manipulative ways to get my parents to give her everything she wants... leaving me left in the corner feeling worthless.  Where's the bottle of pain killers...

       I just finished watching "Donnie Darko," and I have to say this movie turned out to be  a lot  better than the one I watched yesterday.  I loved this movie, Jake Gyllenhaal was the lead character and did a really good job... he's also hot.  The movie was very well written, and I think this movie is now close to the top of my favourite movie list.  You really should see it, it actually brought tears to my eyes.

       Requiem for a dream: This movie deals with the addictions of three different individuals; one to heroin, one to speed, and one to both heroin and sex.  The movie was very well written, and the main character, played by Jared Leto, and his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Connelly, delivered excellent performances.  Each character ends up worse than they already started, and I have vowed to never see this movie again.  I can't even figure out what to write I'm so disgusted.  Watching this movie makes me want to overdose on something... anything... just to get the thoughts of it out of my head.  My head is spinning, and I feel like I want to vomit.  Good movie... if you aren't good with violence and intense imagery, do NOT see it... even I got sick.  It's been 20 minutes since it ended and I still feel like I want to vomit.  :(

       ::YAWN::  I had to wake up at 7 am to babysit for two kids, who are generally good kids, until 3 this afternoon.  It was  exhausting.   I only got paid fucking $3.50 an hour for two kids... which totals $25!  I have people I need to pay off here!  Come on, those pimps are coming after me!  GIVE ME MY MONEY!  I mean, my parents both think I should be getting at least $4 an hour, and I think $5 an hour would cut it, but how would I say it to them?  They're not the most financially stable people, and I know I should be a little more considerate for those who might need a hand or something... but come on.  Both parents are working, I'm sure they can pay the babysitter a little better than $3.50 an hour for two kids.   God, I feel so totally ripped off and neglected...  and that's not the only reason why.    After babysitting I went to dinner with my aunt.  Then she took me shopping for a birthday present, and I got two new cool lamps.  I was so tired when I got home it took me an hour to put the stupid Target brand lamp together.  How hard can it possibly be?  Yay... then Rachel called and we hung out until 9:30.  She kept me company while I was angry at the world... especially the stupid TV.  The fucking stereo wouldn't work.  Piece of shit.  STOP BEING SO ANGRY I keep yelling at myself.  Fucking hell why am I so bitter?  Maybe I'm just tired.  I don't think so.  I don't want to go to bed... wait... I have to babysit tomorrow again....... for $3.50 an hour....... for two kids............. for 7 hours.  I don't think I'll make it.  No one even bothered to call me to keep me company.  (Thanks for thinking of it though, Scott, even the thought is appreciated.)

       Bored.  It's already 9:50, that's usually not early on my breaks but I have to babysit from 8am until 3pm tomorrow for a family who doesn't pay very well, at all.  I have to babysit again on Friday same hours.  Then tomorrow after babysitting I have to go out with my aunt to buy supplies for a scrapbook I don't even want to do anymore, nor do I really have the time to do... even though I just sit around anyway.  That won't exactly be the case if I get a job though.  Softball will be starting soon.  I might as well just drop out... I already paid for it though.  At least I'm getting money for umpiring.  Training starts on Tuesday, it had better be worth my time.  God I'm really bored.  Scott's not talking... no one else worth talking to is online.  I guess I'll go read.

       Welcome, one and all!  It's time for... HYPOCRITICAL BITCH SAYING OF THE WEEK!  Today is starring... (drum roll, please) Casey!  In her profile as an away message, for everyone to see how  miserable  her life is, she has written...  Love yourself~ Sometimes we can get so obsessed with ourselves, with our pain, with how others have slighted us, how life is screwing us over. Sometimes we need to quit wallowing and get invloved with something that lets us forget ourselves for a while.~   and then  in her profile    sad and frustrated...  Doesn't her pain make you want to cry?  Not really... but her bad grammar and spelling makes her look as if she has an IQ level of a newly born chimp, (which, even though they are related to us, isnt very high)... now that's something to make us want to cry.  :)

       ROAR!  I'm angry.  A message always gets fucked up on it's way down the line... someone misinterprets something I say, or they say it wrong to the next person, so it ends up becoming this who said what shit.  It's stupid.  I can't even have a normal conversation with someone without them blabbing it to someone else and then it making it's way back to the source as a completely different thing.  Whatever... screw you guys.  I picked up an application for Jo-Ann fabrics, I hope I get the job.  I still haven't heard back from the Rosemount theatre about my online application.  Scott is also applying there so I was hoping that we'd have the chance to work at the same place, that'd be cool.  Then I picked up an application for the Apple Valley subway because Alex works there, then I go inside to see Lee picking up an order and Alex and Cari behind the counter, I thought it was kind of funny.  So I pick up the application to find out that Alex's last day working there is Saturday because he's going to work at Target instead!  Total bullshit!  Ah.  So now I'm going to have to apply at Target, I probably have a good chance at getting a job there because I'm friends with Jessica's mom, who could help put in a few good words for me. :)   No one can resist me.   I went to Office Max with my dad today.  Saw a hot guy staring at me that worked there... yummy.  Unfortunately I didn't have the balls (literally and figuratively) to ask for an application to work there, too.  Oh well.  I got my really cool Vinyl CDRs that I'm planning on burning my new NIN collection on.  Woo!  They came in cool colors, too.  Unfortunately I owe my dad about 10 bucks for them... 10 bucks that I  don't  have.  Heh... I wonder if he'll forget.   Damn.  Nothing good is on TV.

       Having a few days off really does some good.  It's 1130pm and I'm not falling off my chair from exhaustion like I usually do, probably because I haven't done more than sit at my computer since 11 this morning (when I woke up) to now.  I've been making up for all of the music I lost when I got another hard drive... I've downloaded about 300 files within the last three days.  :)  I even got some new software thanks to Scott :) to help me split movies in half so I can fit them onto cds so they don't suck up all my hard drive space.  While ripping some of my sister's NIN cds onto my pc, I was watching 28 Days Later.  Such a good movie.  My favourite part has to be where Jim gouges the army guy's eyes into the back of his head... I love it.  I really like the movie because it has to do with a highly deadly virus... I've been becoming really interested in that stuff recently.  After I read the Hot Zone by Richard Preston (read the book it kicks ass) I just love learning about viruses and when the next mass extinction will be... I think it'll be within the next few hundred years, so not that long.  Unfortunately I won't be here to witness it.  Ahhhh yeah... Jimi Hendrix just came on.  This is the stuff I've been waiting for allllll night.  I had a fun argument with Scott earlier about his Weezer obsession and he made me listen to some of it, it actually grew on me after awhile... I still haven't convinced him of that.  Plans for tomorrow: -continue to try to convince my parents to let me move the reclining Lay-z-boy (spelling?) into my bedroom -rake the lawn (much to my discontent, but mom wouldn't stop bitching at me for being lazy) -sit on my ass -finish my bag of Starbursts   such a strenuous day... I don't think I'll last through it.  ::rolls eyes::

       Spring break is finally kicking in.  Today is Sunday, and I don't have to do homework!  I can continue to sit on my ass and waste my days away doing absobloodylutely nothing... and feel no guilt!... yet.  The spring feeling has also come in with a kick in my ass.  I'm in the 'spring cleaning' mood, and yesterday i completely tore down my room and rearranged and cleaned everything.  I wonder how long it will last this time.  I went out to dinner with Rachel last night at Red Robin.  It was good to catch up with her, especially since she's the only one of my old friends who bothers to call and make plans with me.  I'm a little ticked off with a lot of people right now, just due to the fact that after all of the times I've tried to fit everything around them, they won't bother to ask for my input on certain decisions.  I was asked to go up to Jess's cabin, but because she clear things up with me on who was going, I've decided to not go at all.  I'm not going to go into too many details... thats the problem with a public blog.  "Slit my wrists and hope to die. Make my friends wonder why."  I was talking with Rachel, or should I say gossiping (such a sinful word), and she told me that supposedly someone told her they thought I was in a 'gothic mood.'  What the hell is a gothic mood?  There is no such thing...  Just because I've started to change who I hang out with because they're the ones who actually make plans with me, doesn't mean I'm gothic... I mean sure, I do wear a fair amount of black and offensive shirts... but that doesn't change who I am.  Or does it?  What's wrong with who I'm becoming, eh?  Not like you have tried to impact me in other ways, like calling to make plans, oh wait, you're too busy with your other friends... who are precisely the reason why I'm not going up to Jess's cabin.   I'm confusing myself.

       Today was a good day.  I took my sister's shirt since she took my jacket, and it was a fun day wearing my "My mom thinks I'm at the movies" shirt.  I think I'll make an offer with her to buy it for like five bucks.  She needs the cash, and I need a cool Tshirt.  English was decent, I got to sit by Brad and Beznit and we listened to all the eulogy's and one award speech by other students, and of course then I get irritated with the bitch sitting across the room from me because she kept saying shit about kids that would get up to present.  I wanted to slap her.  When Alicia went up to present, I could read her lips saying to the girl next to her how pathetic Alicia's speech was, or she'd make comments about the cuts on her arms.  How rude.  When Alicia then went to go sit down, I saw her roll her eyes and mutter "Oh... my... God..."  SHUT DA FUCK UP, HO!  haha. that was fun.  Then I almost got stuck at school until 7 tonight because my ride almost ditched me (good thing I can run fast), but that's another story that I'm not in the mood to tell.  Today the band kids left for Hawaii, and I've still got one day left of school.  It doesn't bother me, amazingly enough the weeks are flying by, considering how boring and empty they are.  Tomorrow will be boring... so will my break.  I need a break though, everyone does.  I hate my school system.    Nonetheless, I feel very relaxed right now listening to Beck.
