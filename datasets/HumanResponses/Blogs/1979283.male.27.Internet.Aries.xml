      Finally got this to work..so here's my first weblog. Pop the cork and blow the horn! Who am I? Name's  Marc Hil Javier Macalua  of the Orion, Bataan Javiers and the Guihulngan, Negros Oriental Macaluas. If you have time, go read my  urlLink resume . Here are recent pictures of me:  urlLink pic1 ,  urlLink pic2 ,  urlLink pic3 ,  urlLink pic4  and  urlLink pic5 . Yup that's me with the  urlLink AEG .  Two reasons for putting up this weblog: 1.)  I want to document my life.  and 2.)  I'm fascinated with my genealogy.  I think keeping an online journal is a step in that direction.  I guess that's it for now. Future weblogs won't be as structured as this. Promise!  P.S. I intend to keep the macalua.com domain for life so if you think we're related, send me an  urlLink email  and I'll gladly give you a "@macalua.com" email address. For real!

      I've been spending many hours getting my ears (and hands) wet playing  urlLink EA Sports NBA Live 2004  on my PS2.  This game breaks the recent downward spiral of the Live franchise.  Totally . I have yet to try out  urlLink ESPN NBA Basketball  (the latest installment of SegaSports' NBA 2K franchise), but from the looks of it this might just be THE best basketball game title for the year. Animation is great, gameplay even better. I can spend months just playing the Dynasty Mode. I can't wait for my younger brother Mon to come back to Manila so I can kick his sorry-excuse-for-a-GM butt (again).  Go buy this game.   Wonder if there's a market for video game reviews in the Philippines...

      Not bad for my first airsoft game in over 3 months! I was panting and wheezing the first few skirmishes but settled quite nicely after. I counted 6 clean kills. Word to self: use .25g BBs next time and think twice about the m150 upgrade that's been cooking in your head :) no pictures to show for the last game..I seriously need a digital camera, or do I take up Wed's offer on her Xbox? The choices I have to make..hehe

      Somehow losing to a school other than DLSU doesn't hurt as much. Getting stuck in traffic driving out of Cubao actually helped. By the time I reached Sharm's house, the heavy feeling had lifted.   My own postgame analysis? Our players didn't want to rip the throats off of the other players; the game was too civil, not a drop of blood..no flying elbows, no open trash talking..it was as if the game was just a Sunday chess match between the two coaches..a far cry from the bloodbath our team got used to during the semifinals.  Hate helps, hate's good . We should learn to hate sometimes...

      Bad day. Seems like my staying up late for work these past few days has finally caught up with me. I'm  tres  tired. It's not so much the workload that's killing me, it's the fact that I can't seem to sleep at night. Shit it's 3:37 AM! I don't think I oversleep during the day (for the uninitiated, I come in for work at 2:30 PM) and I don't drink too much coffee (fuck chocofrapp na lang nga eh) so there's gotta be another reason for my insomnia.. the answer eludes me.  On the Friendster phenonemenon sweeping the office these days.. Everyone's too busy updating this and uploading that. Two truths can be derived from this:  People really like to be seen . Gotta be seen in the right places, with the right people, hopefully doing the right thing..  People also desire to be labeled . I guess they feel secure knowing they're identified with a label everyone can relate to: she's smart, he's silent, she dresses up well, he's got a temper, she's sexy, he's witty, she's a bitch, he's a funny guy, she's sensitive, he's distant, she went to this school, he majored in, she's the friend of, he's the brother of.. well fuck labels and fuck you too if you're the type who reads between the lines. True confidence is reserved for those who accept and cherish life's inequities. True friendship is directly derived from that.   " Therefore those skilled in warfare move the enemy, and are not moved by the enemy ." Read   urlLink Sun Tzu .  I miss my grandparents. All 3 of them. I wish I was a more hands-on grandson. It's probably because they've never grown on me, or never had the chance to. Yearly meetings don't really mean a whole lot. Nothing can truly compare with living under the same roof for god knows how long.. I miss that. In the future, I want that. Not to repay debts, but to learn and to love.  Ateneo lost to FEU in Game 1 of the UAAP Finals. No excuses, just need to focus ahead for Games 2 and 3! Kaya pa rin yan, 1BF!

       urlLink Alleluia !  Last weekend was a whirlwind. Woke up early for a wedding and twas my first time to actually be in one. I was assigned to take the cord off and no, I didn't suck at it. I guess the experiences puts everything in perspective. I don't know if that's good now.  In the afternoon I was my usual G.I. Joe self. Twas also my first time to battletest the ghillie suit I just bought a week back. Flying colors, though I was bad enough to not kill someone. I also nearly broke my knee, figuring in a nasty leg clothesline. The trouble with tall grass is that  it always seems to hide 3 feet tall cement structures where you least expect them . I'm proud of the bruise, as well as the other cuts I got but damn did it hurt. When I'm more liquid, I'm planning to get myself another gun. Something shorter than the other two I have. Damn these toys.  Spent Saturday night in the office trying to figure out the real meaning of life...not.  Discussions with Nancy always seem to bring back Ateneo Philosophy of Religion days. She's an officemate who's really into faith, and I'm the devil......'s advocate. Debates are always enjoyable. But with debates concerning religion, there's always the big assumption that religious truths are philosophical truths. I think most of the time they're not, given the human mind's propensity for wrongful translations. The biggest question always remains to be: how can something as human as, say perhaps, language capture that which is divine? There's really no good answer for that one, at least none that I've completely trusted. Faith they say is a gift. Contact. Carl Sagan.  I miss you Sharm, wuv you! :)

      So I had my third oh-shit-i'm-screwed car problem tonight. First one was in Angeles, radiator pipe cracked, engine couldn't take the heat. Second one was after having my aircon "fixed" at a so-so aircon shop in Katipunan (forgot the establishment's name but I know where your fucking shop is). Radiator got busted and had to buy a new one at Honda. Well the third one was more surreal than screwed, engine died as we cruised along C5. Tried to restart, wouldn't. Went out and went through the motions of trying to fix the problem when in fact had no idea what it was in the first place.  Someone on the other side of the road had motor problems too so I called the guys over. Looked like mechanics to me and one sounded like he knew what he was saying. I insisted it wasn't that I didn't have gas, the gauge told me so so he thought it must have been a busted fuse. They tried and tried and failed and left. So after 45 minutes of fucking "Marc work" Sharm thinks out loud, " baka you're out of gas ". So I go, " what the hell I've tried everything ". Did I forget to tell you the car stopped at a gasoline station? I should have picked that divine clue up. Galing talaga girl intuition :)  So I buy a liter, loaded it, turned the ignition and lo and behold the car starts.  Bastard.

      The wonders (and blunders) of telecommuting..I wonder if there's a progressive Philippine IT company out there who's into it. I'd kill for an IT manager position that gives me a kick-ass notebook, broadband access and the option to work where I please.  It's not the time spent working baby, it's the output! Smart work beats hard work everytime.

      Toxic work schedules really seem to gravitate toward me. Know what, it really doesn't bother me at all. 5 days of hell just doesn't compare with 1 day of pure airsoft bliss :P  Sometimes it's really safer to be in the middle of things. Even when situations call for you to polarize towards a side, I've learned to stay away and watch from the sidelines. Must have been my Arian trait to fight for what I believe in. Not anymore, at least, not for now.  I've also learned to accept the fact that not everyone considers knowledge an asset. In some situations, one gets graded for his ability to navigate political minefields and tripwires and not by the specialist skill/s he brings to the table.

      It comes early for most people. The thrill of the chase..the taste of victory and prestige. I had visions early, and the visions have not stopped. The world today seems like one big elementary quiz bee - you know you're gonna lose, but still you study for it. Preparations galore, and for what.. I long for a thrill most pure, one untainted by human standards. I pray for the strength to&nbsp;understand those who would stand&nbsp;in my way.  &nbsp;  Visions, not promises,&nbsp;are the ones really meant to be broken. Don't bait me with those visions, for I have tasted your version of victory. To win by your standards, is to lose by mine.

      Work has been picking up lately. I've been juggling my time between helping hatch a business idea I've been having wet dreams lately over and setting up the next big development project for the group. I've also touched base (such a corporate jungle-ish shitty phrase) with some steakholders (yea that's no typo) on other concerns. I haven't had time to process my graduate school application (again). I'm beginning to think I can never get that other wet dream going! Wait, there's another dream, not as wet as the other two, but equally satisfying.  They say it's the Zodiac factor coming into play, to which I say bullfrog, but the Arian in me is really begging to be released. Imagine, emphasizing volume over value. Argh. When you say something, say it with conviction and push the right buttons for Christ's sake. How will you further your agenda (wait, is it really yours)? I'm tempted to think agendas don't matter, your agendas that is. Your world was small to start with, so don't squirm too much when the walls come closing in. You complain and whine and make a big deal out of air, it really just makes you a real class act.  Blue beats green, again. 75-72. Do you see the trend? I most certainly do. Go here for the complete  urlLink picture story .  It's true when they say you don't have any permanent enemies.

      1. No major project is ever installed on time, within budget, with the same staff that started it. Yours will not be the first.   2. Projects progress quickly until they become 90 percent complete; they then remain at 90 percent complete forever.   3. One advantage of fuzzy project objectives is that they let you avoid the embarrassment of estimating the corresponding costs.   3.1 When things are going well, something will go wrong.  3.2 When things just can't get any worse, they will.  3.3 When things appear to be going better, you have overlooked something.   4. If project content is allowed to change freely, the rate of change will exceed the rate of progress.   5. No system is ever completely debugged: Attempts to debug a system inevitably introduce new bugs that are even harder to find.   6. A carelessly planned project will take three times longer to complete than expected, a carefully planned project will take only twice as long.  Got these laws  urlLink here .

      Last week gave me a glimpse of a better life, albeit a life less secure for my paranoid mind. Better in the sense that challenges and people are real. It takes much to amuse, let alone astound me, but when visionaries speak, I can't help but buy in. It's been a while since I've had visions-oh-so-grand..can you honestly blame me? To want that which you do not have. To want that which you can never give.  I'm awake! My clock's broken, then again, yours would be too if you chose to daywalk and nightcreep alternately each week. I don't know..I thought I was a night person. That too has changed.  Come to papa...pic of my balikbayan box over at my good buddy Francis' house. As you can see its full of military stuff for my airsoft fashionista complex.     Salamat! This blog has got me  thinking  again.

       Highlights from my first airsoft bivouac game at Nayong Pilipino. Originally posted at Filairsoft.com's TMS Forum.    Rhichie: did MILK really play ka jan! salamat iniwan nyo ko sa battlefield mag-isa ha!     But that's the life of the sniper.....share ko lang solo adventures ko beneath the ghillie feel na feel ko yung pagka-sniper sa bivy!     Medyo late ako dumating so the first game was nearly over when I joined Team Tropa Spent around an hour helping Dark Angel out man the main gates kasi was too tamad (or too chicken) to walk back to Tropa's home base. As i was helping out with player registration, I already had an idea on the enemy strength. At 10:00 PM, the ratio was more than 2:1. Outnumbered talaga. No wonder they nearly made it to Tropa's base. The 1st game ended and I was all by my lonesome. Hanap ako ng hanap, first sa home base, then sa Vigan house. Pina-raise ko kayo sa radio to no avail. So I went to Vigan house to eat. Alone, again, like a sniper. Only this time, I was eating squid balls and hot noodles hehe Alam mo yung feeling na newbie ka sa big game? Nag-iisa? Ganon! yun pala nag-starbucks kayo! Next time dadala na talaga ako ng radyo.    Medyo napasarap siguro inuman nyo, coz when the call came in to get ready for the next game, TMS was MIA so na-adopt na naman ako ni Papa Jun. Our squad was tasked to hold the Cordillera region. I had my game face on. I barely talked. Feeling sniper talaga. When we reached our objective, we were told to spread out, so I picked an area beside one of the steps and made myself comfortable. I had a good view of the entire area and should the moon reveal herself, I still remained hidden in the shadows. I was with King and Papa Jun then but when it started to rain, Papa Jun called in everyone to seek shelter. Everyone went back to the Ifugao huts. But I had a different idea. I stayed in place for over 2 hours, watching, waiting. I was soaked. I could see lights from about 30 yards and could hear fighting inside the Ifugao hut area. I could hear familiar SOCOM voices. Even though the fighting was intense, nakakatawa pa rin yung mga sigawan when they were trying to make someone surrender. I took potshots at the light source, careful not to reveal my position. I overheard a familiar voice, it was ODB's. I was about 10 yards from where they were and when I turned to look, I could see 5 or 6 dark figures going up the steps. I knew mga TMS yon, and I wanted to break my position and join whatever spec ops the base commander had assigned to them again. But the temptation to act out the sniper dream consumed me     Must have been 2 AM (don't really know, didn't have a timepiece with me), I decided to sneak into enemy territory alone, from the hut area to the opposite end of the steps. I crawled and rolled for what would seem ages, careful to always point my gun at the enemy's direction, lest any watching teammate thought I was a tango. But it seemed like I was all alone. No one was firing. No one was moving. I was. Inch by inch by inch. By the time I got to the edge I was spent. I climbed up the steps, always making sure to purposely slow down every movement. I must have spent 5 minutes to climb up each step. I stayed low for almost an hour contemplating my next move. I could hear sporadic fire from my right side. I thought it was a DELTA squad cleaning the area. I rested for around 30 minutes more. It was raining again. I woke up to the sound of people talking. I looked behind and there were 4-7 people behind me. I motioned for them to hold their fire, I couldn't shout STORKY or I would reveal our location. The lead person motioned that he understood. I then crawled to his position to confer with him about their plans. He told me his squad was sent in to reinforce TMS. He asked me kung anong team ko, I told him TMS, then he asked kung san yung iba. I told him I had no idea. I then motioned that I would sneak further up to get a visual on the enemy's defensive position. I was sneaking from bush to bush when I could hear bird whistle calls. I could see a dark figure beside one of the trees. I yelled out STORKY. No reply. I shouted again. Somebody said HALLS. Safe. I moved to the person's position. From the moment he started talking I knew it was AcMad . Giatay ka bai! Kaw ra diay to! Then sunod-sunod na, I saw Rhichie , I saw Tintoot. Tapos si ODB langya, may pa-sir sir pa. "Sir we're planning an assault on...blah blah blah" Sabi ko, "si Milk to".     And so I was reunited with the team, FINALLY! We assaulted a small defensive structure manned by Sid's group. I think I saw ODB sneaking up to Sid's position. Berns kung kaw yon, hats off to you! I ended up dying in that encounter, but the entire night had been one winning moment.     I have flu-like symptoms and I have hundreds of mosquito bites, but I enjoyed my first bivouac experience immensely!     Tom Berenger, beat that.
