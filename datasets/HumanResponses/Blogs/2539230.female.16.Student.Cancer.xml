      *Today's Song*  You'll Think Of Me  KEITH URBAN   I woke up early this morning around 4am  With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate  I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep  But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake  Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms  I've been tryin' my best to get along  But that's OK  There's nothing left to say, but   -CHORUS- Take your records, take your freedom  Take your memories I don't need'em  Take your space and take your reasons  But you'll think of me  And take your cat and leave my sweater  'Cause we have nothing left to weather  In fact I'll feel a whole lot better  But you'll think of me, you'll think of me   I went out driving trying to clear my head  I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left  I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this  And all the baggage that seems to still exist  It seems the only blessing I have left to my name  Is not knowing what we could have been  What we should have been  So   -CHORUS-  Someday I'm gonna run across your mind  Don't worry, I'll be fine  I'm gonna be alright  While you're sleeping with your pride  Wishing I could hold you tight  I'll be over you  And on with my life   -CHORUS-  So take your records, take your freedom  Take your memories I don't need'em  Take your space and all your reasons  But you'll think of me  And take your cat and leave my sweater  'Cause we got nothing left to weather  In fact I'll feel a whole lot better  But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah   And you're gonna think of me  Oh someday baby, someday

      ~today's Song!~   EVERCLEAR   Pat Green  Every day in lunch in the High School All of my senior year I'd drink my Coca-Cola with a touch of Everclear. I never had to study math, science or history. I'd have a chemical flashback to jog my memory.  In my junior year, I swore i loved sweet miss Cherry Ann. One night I put some Everclear, in her Dr. Pepper can. I thought it'd make her easy, but she took it pretty hard. I took her home and rang her doorbell, left her lying in the yard.  -CHORUS- Tequila dries me out. And beer just makes me fat. Whiskey makes me nautious tell me who the hell needs that. Well if you're thinking about drinking, than the answer's crystal clear. It's the invisible intoxicant, it's called Everclear.  I remember my church picnic, in the Spring of '89. Yeah they had four fresh watermelons, sliced right of the vine. When they bowed their heads, giving grace for the food. I poured out my bottle and soaked them melons good They never know what hit 'em, when the potion went to work. There were grandmas doing backflips, grandpas lookin' up their skirts. They were singin' ALELLUIA, and Willie Nelson songs. Preacher said it was the best damn picnic that the Baptists had ever thrown.  -CHORUS-  When I'm drinking Everclear, I think I'm king of this whole world. I'm bigger and badder than John Wayne and cooler than Steve Earle. Until I wake up, and I'm face down in the hall. Hey I'm completely naked, for a reason I can't recall. Well I'm kinda sorta thinking, that maybe I met a chick. Cause there's perfume in the air and lipstick on my neck. Well I hope that she was pretty and I hope that she was kind enough to leave my clothes somewhere easy to find.  -Chorus-

      Dude I woke up at 9 today! I had praise team today!Its cool i love it! ive been doing it for like a year now!  Its weird not going  to Primera but its cool! I had fun times there and i will never forget them but i guess change is new! N.D.F. (short for North Dallas Family church) its cool! its all the regualr ppl i use to see at Primera the ppl who needed a change! Check out our web site! WWW.northdallasfamily.org! its new so its kinda under construction! Dude tonite Im going to the the movies WINK WINK LOL! I dont know what to wear but Hello its just the movies but then again Im a normal teenager who never knows what to wear Till later tonite! ~    The Good Stuff Lyrics Kenny Chesney   Well, me an’ my lady had our first big fight, So I drove around ’til I saw the neon light. A corner bar, an it just seemed right. So I pulled up.  Not a soul around but the old bar keep, Down at the end an’ looking half asleep. An he walked up, an’ said : what’ll it be?  I said: the good stuff.  He didn’t reach around for the whiskey; He didn’t pour me a beer. His blue eyes kinda went misty, He said: you can’t find that here.  ’cus it’s the first long kiss on a second date. Momma’s all worried when you get home late. And droppin’ the ring in the spaghetti plate, ’cus your hands are shakin’ so much. An’ it’s the way that she looks with the rice in her hair. eatin’ burnt suppers, the whole first year, An’ askin’ for seconds to keep her from tearin’ up. Yeah, man, that’s the good stuff.  He grabbed a carton of milk an’ her poured a glass. An’ I smiled an’ said: I’ll have some of that. We sat there an’ talked as an hour passed, Like old friends.  I saw a black an’ white picture an’ it caught my stare, It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair. He said: that’s my bonnie, Taken ’bout a year after we were wed.  He said: smitten by views in the bars, When the cancer took her from me. But I’ve been sober three years now, ’cos the one thing stronger than the whiskey:  Was the sight of her holdin’ our baby girl. The way she adored that string of pearls, I gave her the day that our youngest boy, earl, Married his high school love. An’ it’s a new tee-shirt saying: ’i’m a grandpa’. Bein’ right there as our time got small, An’ holdin’ her hand, when the good lord called her up, Yeah, man, that’s the good stuff.  He said: when you get home, she’ll start to cry. When she says: ’i’m sorry,’ say: ’so am i.’ An’ look into those eyes, so deep in love, An’ drink it up. ’cus that’s the good stuff. That’s the good stuff.

      If I had a million I would build you a mansion,  a hundred miles from nowhere with all a girl could need,  We would run through the hallways and dance in the backyard,  if we ain't got no neighbors ain't noone will see.  and if I had a speed plane we'd fly across the land,  settle in some little border town,  we'd drink margaritas and dance to mariachis,  put you on my speed plane and I would bring you back home.  and if I had a steamboat we'd sail across the ocean,  dock in some little port of call,  we would have a fine time with Swiss cheese and French wine,  put you on my steamboat and I would bring you back home.  But I ain't got a million and I ain't got a speed plane,  I ain't got no boat upon the sea,  all I've got is two strong arms to hold you so tightly,  so baby won't you, won't you please, come back home with me.

      Can you hear them                       They talk about us Telling lies Well that's no surprise  Can you see them See right through them They have no shield No secrets to reveal  It doesn't matter what they say In the jealous games people play Our lips are sealed  There's a weapon We must use In our defense Silence  Spreading rumors So far from true Dragged up from the underworld Just like some precious pearl  It doesn't matter what they say In the jealous games people play Our lips are sealed Pay no mind to what they say It doesn't matter anyway Our lips are sealed  Hush, my darling Don't you cry Quiet, angel Forget their lies

       This song is awesome!        Walking with You is not without hazards Tripping's this traveler's curse The price paid for falling is more than my stumble In a world that is watching and waiting for worst But I listened when you said to go And I set out in spite of my fears I brought truth mixed with my imperfections And the question of what to say when I got here And now that I'm here       Chorus: Should I tell them that You are The One who has made me And saved me to set up a home there inside Should I tell them that I am A perfect example of all You can do with a life What should I say to them, what if I'm failing them? What should I tell them tonight?  Don't get me wrong I'm thankful to be here With this song to sing and a spotlight on me But lately I'm wondering if You are mistaken If You're seeing all of me there is to see But on every face I detect These same questions I've posed to you Like do You speak through the imperfect Or are we too dirty for Your light to get through I want You're light to get through    (chorus) 'Cause they're thirsty but my cup is empty, Lord Come and meet me here in this place 'Cause I'm unashamed, but I'm unprepared And I'm just plain afraid    (chorus x2)
