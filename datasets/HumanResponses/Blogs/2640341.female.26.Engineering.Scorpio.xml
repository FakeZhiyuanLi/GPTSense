      *sigh*  I just can't be bothered to care. Maybe it's the Wellbutrin-XL talking, maybe not. My happiness and my sorrow have been replaced with a feeling of complacency. I just can't care, I am incapable of it.  Sarah has not been laughing a lot lately... Wonder when I'll get back to that?

      I've been back from San Francisco for 3 days now... Still don't know how to put what I experienced into words. When I figure that out, I'll try to transpose. I can think of little else at the moment. I have 2 photographs of him, that I took while he sat on the bed in my hotel room. He's as lovely as ever and when I look at them, they remind me of how much I miss him.  I am going to be alone with my thoughts now.

      Just when you think you have the upper hand on life, it pimp slaps you back to reality.   I am not at my usual bundle of wadded nerve endings/hyper-tension/insane self. I am introspective... I am at a crossroad in my life, I have choices to make. Choices that will affect the rest of my life.   Being with Shaun was like a well-balanced meal. He provided stability and rest to my chaotic nature and I provided enough spontaneity and insanity to his life to make it fun and interesting.   Yin-Yang.

      I had an ice cream sandwich and 32oz. of Mango Madness Snapple for lunch... And I wonder why I'm fat? Actually, no I don't wonder. Whatever.  I have to go into the piercing shop today and get a replacement tongue stud. The one I am wearing now has successfully chipped one of my teeth and I am super pissed off. I keep trying to eat metal... I don't know why.  Why do I even  HAVE  a tongue stud? No, I didn't get it for oral sex. I'd have to have a partner to have oral sex... WTF is wrong with my head?! Why did I put a piece of metal through my tongue? I  WANTED  TO!!! I periodically enjoy inflicting pain upon myself to remind that I can still feel. I know...   Masochist  .  Instead of finding someone who will beat the crap out of me every few weeks, I pay someone to put metal objects through my flesh. As if the emotional torture I put myself through on a daily basis is not enough...   I was chewed up one side and down the other at work after I got my nose ring. I was warned not to get anymore facial piercings. Too bad... I wanted my eyebrow done. Or maybe my lower lip.  Next comes a tattoo. I was thinking either a Celtic knot of some sort to honor my heritage or a  big  FUCK YOU on my forehead to honor my attitude. I just have to decide what it will be...   Fuck it, I'll get several.

      It's now available, the revised version of Friday Night. It's better because I wasn't intoxicated when I wrote it. If you should want to waste a few minutes of your time, scroll down to January 18th's post and have a look.  Jill told me to get that thing out of my tongue. Which in turn prompted me to flick my shiney tongue stud at her. I swallowed the last one while eating a tuna melt on Sunday... Smart.  WTF is the point of Soap Operas anyway? I hate them...

      The latest on the love of my life  Shaun , not Shawn. He is leaving for San Francisco tomorrow. He said he will contact me on Thursday at the earliest. I think he was drunk when he wrote that last e-mail because there are a bitch-load of typos in it. He said he would text-message me as well, because his mobile is now set up to be used in the U.S. We'll see, yeah...  I'm feeling better and better everyday that I am removed from Friday, 16th of January. Nuff said...  I am looking forward to seeing Shaun again. I hope that he doesn't priss out on me. ENOUGH!  Not much else is going on. I got tulips from Jill @ work yesterday. I get flowers from women, not from men. They are pretty white ones. I will probably dry the petals like I did last year and scatter them on my photo shelf.  My heart was broken on Friday 16th of January, by one of my "friends". Scott, who I thought was a good friend, called my mobile phone back because he thought it was Heather's phone. He even admitted it. My heart sank, he's a fucker, not a friend. When I see him again, I intend on telling him that he's no longer aloud to talk to me. ENOUGH!  Why can't I write something funny? I suppose I'm just not in a good mood. That, so far, has been all of January. I hope to have some good stuff to write about soon. It is possible that you think that misery is funny, which is OK, I guess.   Fuck knob.  Later...

      I'm finding out through my "friends" that I did some pretty "freaky" shit to this guy Shawn on Friday night. The extremely scary part is, I don't remember doing some of it, which leads me to believe that they are  MAKING  it up. The fuckers. I am being told that it's just part of drinking in excess and that I should chill out... I saw Mark today... He told me that I left a huge mess in his living room. Told me that I puked on the floor next to the couch. I said "Dude, I didn't. It had to have been Shawn because the first time I puked, I was at the front door." They have to paint the wall... That's how bad it was. Oh, I am a horrible horrible person. The fuckers as I call them, because they can't  REALLY  be friends, can they? Are saying that I had sex with Shawn. I would totally remember getting even partially nekkid. Not only that, dude... He was SO not even my type. Why I was doing all this "freaky" shit to him, I have NO idea. I might NEVER know. Some things just cannot be explained, like UFO's and God. You just have to go on faith that they either do or do not exist... I think I am going to deny this ever happened.

      Friday night... It was the eternal struggle between stupid and smart... Between good and evil... I lost...   I went out with Heather (here at work) and Jackie (nail-tech). We started out at a local sports bar, just a block away from Jackie's house. I drank 3 B-52's. They are sort of like Kahluha and Cream. I recieved 2 phone calls and had to shout to be heard.  We left there, went back to Jackie's house where I had 2 glasses of wine. I was waiting for them to get ready, because, let's face it, I'm as good-looking as I'm going to get at this point. You can't improve on perfection... right?   We went from Jackie's house to downtown Eugene. I had a boiler-maker (beer w/ a shot of whiskey) at Original Joe's. We walked over to Jogger's. I had a screwdriver and shouted obscenities at people who were sucking at karaoke. I still can't believe we paid a $3 cover to listen to people suck at singing. After 20 minutes, we left and headed to Quacker's Last Stop...   I made the mistake of talking to geeks in a Pontiac who asked me where the party was. Their faux ghetto was worse than mine. I told them the party was wherever we went, but they were not allowed to follow... They tried for a couple of blocks but gave up. I shouted obscenities at them as well. We arrive at Quacker's. Heather keeps calling her friend Mark, to get him to hang out with us. I'm guessing that I'm not enough for her at this point. Or maybe I am too much... This cute blonde that was outside of Jogger's talking to us is now at Quacker's. I'm convinced that she's a friend of either Heather or Jackie. Unaware of the power of being stupid drunk.   We sit at the bar; my stool feels like it's going to fall apart. I ride it like a bronco and order myself a Long Island Ice Tea. I'm sucking it down, telling the bartender that he's a fucking genius. Heather and Jackie are talking to the blonde about her loser boyfriend. He walks up and announces that he doesn't want to marry her, I feel like knocking his teeth out. Instead I quietly lean over to Heather and shout, "He's a fucking loser!" Offended, he walks away, mumbling something extremely mature. His girl is in the bathroom sobbing.   This Albany Firefighter is hitting on Jackie. She shoots him down; she leaves to check on the blonde. The Albany Firefighter moves on to Heather, tells her that she smells like bubble gum and that he wants to chew her. She tells him to fuck off or something equally as brilliant. I ask him if being an "Albany Firefighter" gets him laid a lot... Without waiting for a reply, I shout that I bet it doesn't. Disgusted, he leaves mumbling something equally as mature as the last. Heather leaves me at the bar, she's actually afraid of these assholes.   I continue to suck down liquid courage. Mark and 3 of his friends arrive; I hear the commotion, look over my shoulder and check them all out. I've seen Mark before; the other 3 are unfamiliar and equally unimpressive. I finish my 1st Long Island and stand at the table that they've arranged themselves at. I am now drinking water. I feel mouthy and buzzy but all together OK. I am introduced to everyone. Yes, Mark... Cheeser... Russ... Oh yes, this is Shawn... I shake hands with all of them, but my first impression of Shawn was... He has eyebrows like a bitch. I nearly said it, but he was being nice, I didn't want to fuck the group up. We got to talking. I was really into listening to Shawn. I have no idea why; he wasn't saying anything that was worth a fuck. He's sitting across from me. I'm spilling all sorts of information about myself, mainly the fact that I'm freaky as shit. He kept saying, now THAT'S what I call a lady! I still thought he had bitch eyebrows, but the alcohol was telling me to fuck him.   Periodically getting up to empty the bladder although, I can't really feel anything at this point, other than the extreme muscle cramps that are accumulating in my calves. He heads to the loo with me and we have our arms around each other. I can't remember ever looking at his face, which leads me to believe that I didn't care to. I decide that it's a good idea to get another Long Island because I can still pick myself off of the toilet. The night starts to get fuzzy... I suck down the Long Island and notice that Shawn has gotten himself one as well. I can't remember when, but at some point, he switched seats with someone and ended up next to me, first on my right, then on my left. It's when he was on my left that shit got nasty. Damn my ambidextrous hands!   When he was on my right, we did flaming Dr. Pepper's. I let mine get out of control, it started burning the table, Shawn was quick enough to dunk it into the bigger glass, and I downed it like a dirty bastard. Right after a toast of "Are you in?" Various glasses of beer happened, I can't remember whose glass I was drinking out of, I didn't care...   Shawn was on my left now, a shot of something clear and bitey was in front of me... I still don't know what it was. I asked several times, was told to shut-up and drink it. This seemed logical, so I did. I felt my head lean over on his shoulder, I felt tired and sick. He smelled like my ex. I kissed his neck and my left hand landed on his thigh... Ooops, yep, right up to his package. I heard him say "Whoa! That’s nice." I believe he was just about as fucked up as I was at that point. I remember that I kept giving him a fun time outside of his pants. I was told later that I was talking dirty to him as well. Telling him that I wanted something hard for my birthday. This doesn't sound like something I'd say... Even drunk... I'm cleverer than that. I remember picking up his right hand, which he gave over without a fight. He was very willing. I started sucking his fingers. I don’t even know where they had been, fuck, that’s disgusting.   I think we were about to leave; everyone was over at the bar again. I followed. Stuck my hand right between the back of Shawn’s legs. A shot was set in front of me; I’m told it was a Creamy Nipple. I held my mouth. Shawn told me to drink it. I said, “No way dude; I’ve reached my limit.” I really had reached my limit, but it was about 5 drinks ago. I’m such an amateur.   I remember being outside with him at one point. I asked if I could kiss him. He said that it wouldn’t be right, that he was married. I said, just a peck then, a peck on the lips. I tried to figure in my head where he thought a kiss was out of control but getting an outside the pants hand-job was not… I still don’t see it.   We went back inside. I found Heather and shouted, “Don’t let me do anything I’m going to regret!” She asked, “What makes you think you’ll regret that?” I thought, what woman in her right mind WOULDN’T regret that!? I started wondering how the fuck we were going to get home. I was scared and felt so stupid for getting so drunk. I went to the toilet again and washed cold water over my face in a futile attempt to sober up. When I came out, everyone had gone.   I stumbled out to Heather’s car. I don’t know how or why Jackie’s petite little ass found it’s way into the front seat, but it did. I shoved myself in. Shawn between Heather and me. I was not in the mood for anything at this point. I had reached my zenith in tolerance, both with alcohol and with bullshit. The music was loud, Heather wanted to hear “Sweetest Thing”. I felt the gorge rising in my throat, but fought it down and thought of water and sleep… The next thing I know, I hear Heather shouting “No, STOP IT!” I look over to see Shawn has his hands on her tits. I pause in thought and then scream at him. “Knock it off you stupid fuck! She’s in love, don’t touch her! I’ll fucking kill you if you don’t stop” He stopped and patted me on the thigh, “It’s OK”, he said, “Show me some love.” I felt the tears streaming out of my eyes. “FUCK YOU!” I shouted. “She’s lucky, she has love, it’s beautiful, and she doesn’t deserve to get groped!” He was trying to calm me down, but I just wanted to rip his head off.   I remember shouting at Mark to slow the fuck down. Then we arrived at the security gate at his “community”. The drunken bastard in front of us couldn’t get his code in, we all laughed at this and Mark shouted out his window and told the guy he would let him in. The Camry lurched its way up onto the lawn. It struck me as pretty funny that we were in a gated trailer park… It seemed ghetto fabulous.   I was relieved to have gotten there alive. I knew that Mark was pretty fucked up; he admitted later that he shouldn’t have been driving. Everyone started vacating the car, someone opened my door. I think it may have been Jackie. As soon as I pulled myself out of the Camry, I noticed that everyone else had made it inside, other than Shawn. He told me that he wanted to “toss an arc” outside. I told him to piss on his BMW. He considered, then, told me he didn’t want to. I laughed. He was about to unzip his jeans when he got shy. I just let him know that he didn’t have anything that I wanted to see at that point anyway.   I staggered past him and felt him tugging on my shirt when I headed up the steps to the house. A blast of heat, it must have been cold outside, although I didn’t realize it. I immediately bent over to admire an extremely plump cat that wound it’s way around my legs. I could hear Shawn drawling on about what the deal was. I loudly announced there was no deal, there was just life and made my way to the biggest sectional couch I had ever laid eyes on. It looked like heaven and I was extremely focused on getting there and no where else.   Somehow, Shawn was standing next to me; I don’t know how the hell he’d gotten there so fast. He was asking me how I planned on laying down. Sideways or on my back. My response was, “Fuck, I don’t know.” I sat down. He whined, that it was very important that I tell him. I lay down on my back, someone handed me a pillow, I grunted in gratitude. I looked up at Shawn as if to say… you’re still here? I tell him he should back the fuck off and make to sit up; my left foot is all that hits the floor. He laughs, “That’s for traction!” I continue to ignore him, someone hands me a bottle of water and 2 aspirin, I tell him that he’s a god.   Shawn vacates the living room, wanders into the master bedroom where a waterbed awaits him. Soon everyone has picked a bed and or a bed partner and has left. Russ is the last to leave the kitchen as he is reading a newspaper; I’m guessing he’s the one who hooked me up with the water and aspirin. I make an attempt at conversation but only a grunt escapes me as I pass out.   I wake about an hour later; Russ was kind enough to leave a light on in the kitchen. I open up my mobile phone to it’s notebook and begin writing. I realized that I love you very much still. I just do. No compromising. You are the love of my life. Shaun .A.R. This took me about 15 minutes… I tucked my phone back into my pocket, feeling very satisfied with myself. I pass out again.   I don’t think I was asleep very long as the pulling back of my tongue woke me. I was scared, I was in a stranger’s house and I was about to vomit. I tried meditation… mantra: you will not puke, you will not puke… it worked for a short while, I sat up slowly… stood up slowly… started walking very careful not to jumble my insides towards the bathroom. There must have been some seismic activity somewhere on planet earth because my guts felt it and recoiled in retaliation. I puked all over the wall and front door and the linoleum patch. I heard it splatter and winced at the thought of having to clean it up.   I stepped away and towards the bathroom once more. I made it in, shut the door, flipped on the light… Oooo… bright… this must have caused some chemical reaction in my body because before I could reach the toilet, I filled up the sink. Then, as soon as it had began, it stopped.   I looked up at myself in the mirror. I had managed to vomit on my right boob and my hair was dank with it as well. I nearly started to cry as I looked over the bathroom and myself. Most of it had landed in the sink, which of course, was refusing to drain. But the smell, the sheer stink of it… it was just impossible. I made the brilliant decision to take off my shirt. My bra abandoned an hour before was tucked in my pant’s pocket. I rinsed the puke out of my hair and grabbed a towel off of the towel rack.   I made my way, half naked, back into the living room to try and mop up my expelled dignity. After franticly making the attempt and soiling up one bath towel, I threw it and my shirt in the washer. I went back with another towel and some carpet cleaner and went to work on the wall and the bit of carpet I had not aimed for. I stood up in disgust, I realized this was not going to happen, not tonight. I worked between that spot and the bathroom sink. It was now drained with a bunch of yuck in the bottom of the bowl. Yes, I had to touch it… I scraped it out and threw it in the toilet. I went back to the washer, which by this time had run it’s cycle and put my shirt into the dryer.   Exhausted, I made my way to Russ’s bedroom, he was gone, I would sleep there for an hour or so. I wasn’t about to go on the couch again, not half naked. I pulled my shoes off, landed on my stomach and somehow managed to pull a blanket over me. I heard someone get up and shut my door, saying something about wandering drunks. I later learned that Heather had asked Mark to get up and check on me.   6:24am, the door to the room I had landed in is flung open, Heather tells me that we have to go, Jackie has to go to work. I do not know how I mustered the strength to sit up and put my shoes on, but I did. I walked somewhat swiftly to the dryer, with a towel I had picked up somewhere around me to retrieve my shirt. Heather asked what the hell I was doing. I grunted that it was a long story, while in the little laundry cove, I struggled with the still damp shirt. I walked back to Russ’s room to get my phone off of the nightstand and noticed that Shawn had taken up residence on the couch. I felt very lucky that I had used the bedroom. On the way back out the door, I pointed at Mark and said “Flowers.” Then I added, “Kick Shawn in the sack for me.”   We all piled into Heather’s car and I began recounting the night’s events with my yellow fleece vest gathered around me. I think someone had a window open because it was absolutely freezing in that car. I was still drunk. I was nauseous, I remember thinking about driving home. I was silent.   Jackie mentioned stopping at Starbucks and I wanted to hit her in the back of the head. I just wanted to go home and continue sleeping, the less time I had to take in getting there, the better.   We arrived at Jackie’s house and I asked Heather if I could follow her part way home. She said she’d wait for me. I sat down in my car, started it up, immediately turned off the radio and cranked the heat up. I just thought over and over in my head, if I fuck up and get caught like this, I may as well shoot myself.   My car finally warmed up and the windows defogged, I crept out of Jackie’s driveway and followed Heather out of Springfield. Minding the speed limit the entire way and staying completely focused on the road in front of me as well as my surroundings. It was 7:30am. We parted ways around The Blarney Stone, she took I-5, I couldn’t bare the thought of driving faster than 40mph. I went with HWY 99. My hands were clenched on the wheel the whole way home, I arrived just before 8am…   I left everything in my car except my phone. I made my way in the house, used the toilet, washed my hands and removed my contact lenses, which I fully expected to be wielded to my eyeballs. Luckily they were not. I regarded myself carefully in the mirror, my hair still pulled back. My nose piercing had suffered, it was either puke or puss, I didn’t care which, I washed my face.   I made my way to bed, my dog sniffing me the whole time, I had failed to realize it. She was both extremely happy to see me and extremely put out because she had to vacate my bed. I lay on my side, her nose examining my feet and legs. I pass out.   I wake up at around 10am, gagging on the smell of myself. I decide it’s time for a hot shower. Nearly passed out in there, 30 minutes later, I wrap my head in a towel and pass out in bed again. I woke up when my mom came home at 1pm.   I feel better now, but I do not think my internal organs will ever be the same again.  I can't believe some people do this shit all of the time...

      So yeah... Hmmm... Nothing today. He was of course, headed back to London to pick his passport up before his trip. Why the fuck do I care anymore? I mean, from the e-mail, it's obvious he doesn't. Not on the same level at least.   I've discovered something about myself as of late. Maybe I've known it all along? Although I would have a relationship with him again, I wouldn't let him hurt me. I wouldn't put so much into it that hurting me would be possible. So, it wouldn't be the same, he's right. I would eventually get to a point with him where we would be like we used to, but it wouldn't start out that way. My problem with him has always been HE GIVES UP ON LOVE TOO EASILY! I do not. I go for the gold, I want it all. I'm like a marathon sex-machine as well. We weren't matched with labidos... Here I am trying to find reasons on why I shouldn't love him or want him anymore, but none of them are truly working. I'm screwed.

      Ugh... The weekend was boring. I watched The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen... There wasn't anything extraordinary about it, they used a lot of computer animation and let's face it folks, that's becoming pretty ordinary.  On the crap post... I guess things are going OK. I'm getting the feeling that he wants to get together as friends. It's not fair, but who said life was fair? On the plus side, I will get to go to San Francisco again, I love it there! There you go folks, I will be in San Francisco between the 21st and 28th of January. If you feel like stalking me or something, I'm fine with that, I could do with the attention...  I feel like I'm prattling on being annoying, so I will stop now. LATER!

      I couldn't stand it, I had to go back and re-do this pile of $#@t post. I don't know why I started this post so soon, I'm going through some crap in my life right now that doesn't leave my mind in such a wonderful state. I have a hard time thinking of anything other than work and sleep...   Crap thing #1: I'm finally offered the possibility of closure on a long-term relationship that ended almost 3 years ago. I know I need closure, but I'm not truly sure if I'm going to get it. It's just one of many possibilities that MIGHT happen. So, I hope for the best and expect the worse... It's a long boring story, I might bother you with the details one of these days, although, not today...  Crap thing #2: I am currently filing chapter 7 bankruptcy... because I'm a dipshit when it comes to money and I spent a lot of it while this long-term relationship was happening... It was long distance, plane tickets add up...  Crap thing #3: I am just over-all miserable, due to items #1 & #2. I'm not in the mood to let anyone else into my inner world, my inner being is extremely ugly right now and would probably beat the crap out of anyone who attempted...  There you go, 3 things, the last caused by the first... It's like a vicious triangle of love lost. You know that song by Natalie Merchant?   The Letter If I ever write this letter the pages I could write but I don't know where to send it you have vanished heaven knows where you live heaven only knows   if I ever write this letter bitter words it would contain just and unrequited lover wishing she had never spoken your name had never known your name   but if I ever write this letter the truth it would reveal knowing you brought me pleasure how I'll often treasure moments that we knew the precious, the few   There is a reason that we all can relate to songs like this... It's because it happens to us all... No one gets to escape heart ache... Oh, the suckage... This post is pretty pathetic as well, but there you go.

      i chipped another tooth with my tongue ring on monday. this one was a pretty sizable chunk out of one of my molars. my tongue ring is now dangling from a chain on my rearview mirror. my tongue is nearly healed over, just a tiny white spot on the bottom. i have to make an appointment to see the dentist to get it fixed. probably filled or capped or both. either way, i know it's going to be expensive. i got called a dumb-ass by one of my friends... which is always appreciated, i LOVE being called a dumb-ass.    me : (sticking my tongue out) "it'sh gone... chipped anover toof.."   him : (smiles, seeing opportunity) "gee dumb-ass, didn't you read the disclaimer from the piercers? they say that IS a possibility."   me : (tongue back in mouth now) "yes, well, i thought after i got the shorter bar that this problem would be remedied. i hadn't bitten it since i changed out the longer bar."   him : "well, better go to the dentist and get it fixed."   me : (full of sarcasm) "yes  daddy ... i will."   him : (seeing another opportunity) "now you're going to have to get your nipples pierced." while pinching his own.   taking a bite of my chowder, i sat there, wondering  why the fuck do i eat lunch with this weirdo. oh yeah... he's my friend...    me : (prematurely swallowing unchewed clams) "there is no way in HELL i'm getting my nipples pierced."   him : (still pinching his nipples & smiling) "when one dies, two come to the funeral."   me : (starting to feel either really sick or really turned on, i can't tell which) "yeah... you need to stop."   him :  perverse laughter.    me :  still feeling sick or turned on, still can't figure out which.

      yes, well, if you feel the need to blame it all on me...  go for it. i can take it. people blame me for shit all the time.  why should you be any different?   ah... to be typical...  if i ever fully understand men, i think my head will explode.  * SNAP ! * back to reality buddy...  something that has bothered me from the start...  " then " is to be used in conjuncture/reference with time or to show the order of events. example: I am going to punch you in the mouth  then  kick you in the nuts.  " than " is comparative. example: I would rather kick you in the nuts  than  punch you in the mouth because your teeth would cut my fingers.  merely examples, i am not a violent person.

      yesterday's post was not Rated-R it was at the very least an NC-17, but i'm thinking more along the lines of PORN.   YUM!   i don't normally write about anything as boring as food... but i'm surprised that i don't... i think of it nearly as much as i think about sex. (no... not a guy. just in touch with my "inner dude") this is not to say that i don't do the normal typical female neurotic crap... but, when i do, it pisses me off. OK that said, back to one of my favorite topics... food. today, i'm eating Baja Fresh's boring ol' bean n' cheese burrito. now what makes it so fucking good is their salsa verde. i fucking LOVE salsa verde and theirs is pretty fuckin' awesome. i think i could drink that shit straight from the bowl. i'm scarfing this lovely hunk of foodness while i type... back to salsa... it's so fuckin' good, it's like "naughty sex" for your mouth. you know, where as chocolate would be sweet romantic love-making for your mouth... salsa is the fun dirty kind. at this point yer probably saying... ew... food and sex.. one might also say..    she's so focused on it... which one?   both...   why?   because...   because is not an answer...   yes it is. why aren't YOU focused on it?   don't answer my question with a question...   why not?   because...   see, because IS an answer. now, if you're not planning on either:    A.)  buying me dinner or   B.)  burying that lovely face of yours between my thighs.. you can   C.)  your ass out the door.

      you know those smashed penny machines in touristy areas? the ones that take 2 quarters and 1 penny to make em work...  you should know, if you don't you haven't lived...  anyway... you put yer money in the slots and choose the design you want and turn the crank. * CLINK * out plops your penny, looking like it's been ran over by a fucking train with a neat little design on it.  ...this is how my heart feels most of the time... today is no exception.

       Rated-X   Disclaimer:  I know that nearly everything I've posted up to this point has been PG-13, if you are easily offended...  DO NOT READ BEYOND THIS POINT     The Payout   -- by  who the hell do you think...   	I'm led out of the bathroom... when I see you pick up the scarves a small prick of panic runs it's way up the back of my spine and I shudder, anticipating the events to come. I've let go of so many things in being with you. Inhibition is the least of them. I feel a sense of freedom and lack of control all at once and am overwhelmed in liberation. These feelings all occur in the time it takes to walk from the bathroom to the bed where I will be bound.  	This is the first time but surely won't be the last. You let the scarves fall from your hand to the bed and pull me gently around from behind you to the front. Looking deep into my eyes, you see the scant amount of panic that is left and you smile and deliver a  "ssssshhhh it's ok"  that is barely audible. As you lean in and softly kiss me on the mouth, the taste of you nearly gone from my lips. I am annoyed that my mind has wandered from your kisses along my neck and your hands running their way up my arms to my breasts and nipples to the current thought.  I reflect on the moments in the shower and instantly regret not rinsing between my legs before leaving it. I still have my hang-ups about the amount of moisture that accrues there when I give you pleasure. I always want to wash up before being devoured; I do it because I want to encourage many revisits. I push the thought from my mind as I realize there is no way in hell that you'd let me go back to the bathroom.  	You continue to kiss my neck and shoulders as you gently push me down to the bed. One hand touches my chin as your lips come up to meet mine and then fingers slowly trace their way down my throat, between my breasts, down my stomach, pausing to humorously poke me in the belly button, then the palm flattens against my stomach, right below my belly button and turns, fingers down sliding slowly towards... I inhale, anticipating your fingers toying with my moistness. I'm quivering with excitement when I feel your hand pause in its journey and make its way back up towards my breasts. My mind screams  "NO YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY!"  but you know exactly what you're doing. You bypass my breasts entirely, which induces further frustration, which I immediately discard and run your hand down my right arm, lifting it and guiding it to the side. I come to consciousness that my eyes have been closed and I open them to realize that somehow you've already placed the black scarf over my eyes. I let out a sigh and feel you pause in securing my right arm. You lean in to whisper in my ear. I only know this because I can sense your heat and smell the remnants of your cologne.  "You're OK..."  Not a question but a statement. You kiss the side of my mouth. I turn my face to return the kiss but you are gone before I get the chance. One last light tug and my right arm is secured. I feel your weight sink onto the bed at my hips and I wonder what you are doing. I don't ask, I trust. I feel your weight shift, and then settle again, you are now straddling me. Just for an instant, then I feel your weight shift again and you are on the other side of the bed. Your hand slides down my left arm, guiding it up and securing it. Back down, it travels the length of my side, slightly tickling it's way down to my hip, pausing and moving from the side to the top. Over my belly button this time, palm flat again, fingers pointed down. I'm not anticipating that you will... I roll my eyes from under the black scarf in exasperation but say nothing, I know better. I know you're watching my face, I keep it expressionless. Your hand eases forward, I maintain my sanity... barely... I feel your fingers begin their journey through my hair... Thinking... Not far now... don't react... your middle finger slips down and slowly begins it's seduction of my highly sensitive, moist folds and nub. I expect you to stop at any second, so I try not to get attached to the feeling. You continue making circles around then small flicks up and down and across. My hips begin to quiver and jerk involuntarily. Satisfied that you have aroused my interests, I could not hide it from you. Your hand leaves it's place betwixt my thighs and travels down, back to the top of my thigh, down my knee, to my ankle where you secure it with the 3rd scarf. At this point, 3 of my 4 limbs are stretched, nearly to their limit, and bound. I hear your feet touch the floor, my senses slightly heightened, due to the denial of sight. I follow your slight movement, I know now that you are standing at the foot of the bed, looking down at me. I imagine what you'd look like standing there, full height, manhood erect. I can't help but smile. I knew as soon as I did this, it was a mistake. You seize my right foot, after the initial surprise, my smile broadens. You shove it to the bed and quickly tie it, not any tighter than the others... I begin to giggle. I imagine you are smiling and having a hard time maintaining silence.   	I feel your lips touch my right ankle. My nipples are sore from being hard for so long now. I want to rub them and try to make them calm down, but I cannot. My shoulders move from side to side a few times as the wish of a warm touch overcomes me. I feel your lips and tongue kissing and licking their way up my leg, now at my knee. I'm wondering if I will get kissed before devoured... which order the events will occur... I realize that my breath is coming in shorter gasps as I feel your lips on my thigh. My lips are dry, my mouth feels like it's stuffed full of cotton. Sometimes... I feel like you crawl into my head and listen to my thoughts. Your kisses halt. I feel you move up between my legs... your weight balanced around me. I realize your hovering over the top of me. I wish I could wrap my legs around you and pull you to me. You lean in, kiss my lips. Your saliva renewing my mouth. It's strangely erotic that I'm drinking you in. The parch-ness slowly dissipates. You kiss my neck; my head lolls away from you, better exposing it to your kisses. I feel your hips settle a bit. Your hardness rubs past my nub and comes to a rest between my creases. Not penetrating, I shudder. You continue kissing my neck, I feel you smile at my involuntary response. You bend and kiss my already alert nipples. The pleasure is painful but enjoyable all the same. You lick and softly nibble one, then the other. Gasps escape my lips with each new sensation.  	You continue your journey of kisses. Pausing to lick my belly button. I think an unrelated thought of tequila... Wait, it's related... Your chest is pressed against my now dripping wetness. I feel you lift and slide down. I hear you inhale deeply, my sexual scent. I actually blush at this. You slide a finger into me, gathering moisture. I am wet all the way down my ass. Gliding in and out, another finger tracing tiny circles around my swollen nub... my pleasure building again... Your finger leaves my opening and goes to another. Slowly entering, gliding in and out of that orifice, while your finger continues tickling me. I moan in ecstasy, I nearly come, you sense this and stop. You bend forward and begin to lick the moisture off. You finger still in my ass. Your tongue takes the place of your other finger, flicking my nub then licking my creases. I'm in heaven. I know I won't last much longer with the sensory overload that is taking place. I realize I'm holding my breath; I let it out in a rush and inhale deeply through my mouth, which is drying out again. In my head, I'm standing on the brink, swaying, my physical and mental sanity on the edge. I always become afraid at this point. Do I jump or do I remain afraid? I take a step forward in my mind and leap into the dark chasm. At that instant I scream out in release as the waves of pleasure sweep over me. It's nearly an out of body experience as my arms and legs strain against their prison. I realize that gasps and loud moans of pleasure are still coming from my lips as I come back to my body.. panting. My body quakes and quivers. I no longer feel you between my legs. I'm guessing that you're still there but you've backed off to admire your work.  	My first words.  "Hold me..."  come out as a whimper. I feel the scarves release my legs and then my arms. The blindfold comes off of my eyes. I see you in the candlelight; you're next to me now, propped up on your arm, looking down at me smiling. You bring your hand up to my lips and run an ice cube over them. My lips already parted, I feel cold water run over them and droplets fall into my mouth. You bend down and kiss me sweetly, softly. I wrap my arms around your neck and pull you down to me.

       Slip Sliding Away  Paul Simon  It's just this one verse, so if you're not a Paul Simon fan, do not fret...        I know a man, he came from my hometown      He wore his passion for his woman like a thorny crown      He said Dolores, I live in fear      My love for you is so overpowering      I'm afraid that I will disappear.         I know a woman, became a wife      These are the very words she uses to describe her life      She said a good day ain't got no rain      She said a bad day is when I lie in bed      And think of things that might have been   Ever since I was a little girl and first heard this song, I've wanted someone to feel that way about me. This is the way that I love, when, on the rare occasion, I do love. There are just a precious few out there that we are lucky enough to feel that connection with. I guess everything does happen for a reason. If we don't suffer, we don't appreciate joy like it deserves to be appreciated. Just my opinion...   I haven't heard from Shaun in 5 days.. I'm not anticipating that I ever will again. It's OK though. He was right, it's all going to be OK. We got to go on a good note this time and my soul can be at ease that I did everything that I could have done, that I should have done.  I am now experiencing joy again...  I have seen the mountain...  It is good...

      i like to assign songs to people i know or situations in my life...  in relation to men i have known/know:   S.R.  =  Stay or Leave  Dave Matthews (i think the title says it all)   A.B.  =  Kill You  Eminem  (he very nearly did + the maternal issues = perfect song for "man tits")   J.P.  =  Dude (Looks Like A Lady)  Aerosmith  (yes, a very unattractive lady)   B.H.  =  Ol' Dirty Bastard   (no particular song title, it's the fact that he was an Ol' Dirty Bastard)

       19th Nervous Breakdown    (written by: Jagger/Richards)   You're the kind of person you meet at certain dismal dull affairs.  Center of a crowd, talking much too loud running up and down the stairs.  Well, it seems to me that you have seen too much in too few years.  And though you've tried you just can't hide your eyes are edged with tears.   You better stop, look around, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes,  Here it comes. Here comes your nine-teenth nervous breakdown.   When you were a child you were treated kind  But you were never brought up right.  You were always spoiled with a thousand toys but still you cried all night.  Your mother who neglected you woes a million dollars tax.  And your father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax.   You better stop, look around, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes,  Here it comes. Here comes your nilne-teenth nervous breakdown.   Oh, who's to blame, that girl's just insane.  Well nothing I do don't seem to work,  It only seems to make matters worse. Oh please.   You were still in school when you had that fool who really messed your mind.  And after that you turned your back on treating people kind.  On our first trip I tried so hard to rearrange your mind.  But after while I realized you were disarranging mine.   You better stop, look around, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes,  Here it comes. Here comes your nine-teenth nervous breakdown.  Here comes your nine-teenth nervous breakdown.  -------------------------------------------------------- Yes last night... I broke down.

      I know I've said it before, but this man is IMMENSELY talented. I had a dream about him on Friday night. No, it wasn't sexual. Neither is my attraction to him. I could be a Dave Matthews groupie minus the sex part. I would LOVE to follow him around to every single concert event. He's just so amazing. Yes, I'm listening to  Some Devil  again.   I LOVE DAVE MATTHEWS!

      examples of why being a woman pisses me off:  How the fuck do women and men ever get together then stay together? The e-mail that I just read from Shaun and letting go of a considerable amount of rage, made me realize that... I'm a fucking jerk...   If you read it like a woman, you see "Oh, What an inconsiderate ASSHOLE."   However, looked at through fresh eyes and with previous knowledge of the relationship, not to mention the follow-up e-mail, one might conclude with:   "He's just trying to watch out for her and make sure she doesn't hurt herself with hopes of something that might not happen."  Sure he could have put it a different way and if he were a woman... he would have. He's a man and as it was explained to me last night, men aren't good at a number of things. Sometimes that includes conveying feelings. As a woman, I need to accept that. Men and women are DIFFERENT!  This is just a reminder, to be more careful and to watch myself. I know Shaun will still do it and he will always do it, he feels a certain duty to look out for me. However irritating that might be, it's just the way it is. I remember him saying that he wouldn't allow me to get hurt again, I guess this is his way of fulfilling that duty for himself.

       CRASH AND BURN  -Sheryl Crow-  I watched the sun come up on Portland I waved goodbye to all my friends I packed my car and headed to LA I gave away all my loose ends  Somebody said you gotta get away To wanna go back home again I left my universe standing there Holding the hand of my best friend  And it's laughter that I feel when I think of you It's one more dusty rose about to turn I'll see you when I reach New Mexico If I'm in the mood to crash and burn  I wrote a letter that I never mailed I rehearsed a dialogue in my head In case you ever wanted to track me down I'll take my cell phone to bed  And it's laughter that I hear when I close my eyes And it's one more punchline I forgot to learn I call you up when my bottle's dry I'm on my way to crash and burn  Antigone laid across the road And let a mack truck leave her there for dead Just because her lover split the scene Well love might be great but why lose your head  Well, it's laughter that comes up when I cry for you And my heart may break again before it learns And I might be stupid enough to want to fall again Cause I've gotten use to the crash and burn I say I've gotten use to the crash and burn

      I love Dave Matthews Band... I have a sticker bought from a concert in Portland, Oregon declaring this. If I wouldn't have been deathly ill that night, I would have went to see him... I should have braved it anyway. I feel lucky though, he has a place in Seattle, WA so if I wanted to stalk him, I probably could. I love Dave's solo album  Some Devil  as well. If you haven't yet paid it a listen, do yourself a favor and do so. He's one of my top 10 all time favorite artists, I can say that without hesitation. That shameless plug for one of my favorites aside, I shall talk about something else.  One of my friends here at work, whom I've had the pleasure of spending some quality time with outside of work, pointed out to me that I was ignoring her... I did not realize said offense. I pointed out that I hit her up for lunch last week and that she had yet to respond... So who is ignoring WHOM here? She immediately recanted... "Maybe ignoring isn't the right word..." Hmm no, I think not. She went on to say... "You've just been very quiet lately." Apparently, this isn't something that I am too often or she wouldn't have bothered pointing it out. I guess I didn't realize what a loud obnoxious individual I am! I told her I've been doing a lot of thinking, which, I have. I think the Wellbutrin-XL is mellowing my ass out as well. No more bundle of waded up nerve endings. Fuck! What will I do if I actually remain STABLE!? I used to have these huge panic attacks for no reason at all, now they are just lil wee panic attacks. I suspect they will go away all together eventually, I cannot say that I will be sad to see the back of them. I think I'm just as crazy as I used to be, maybe I am more calculating crazy than insane crazy now. I haven't had the opportunity to be spontaneous for a while, so maybe I will bathe in the moonlight naked tonight... Now that I've said it, it's a plan and will no longer work for spontaneity purposes... DAMN IT! We'll see what the evening brings.  I did tell Shaun that he makes me better. Which isn't a lie. I don't lie.

      I enjoyed my day off yesterday. I went to the coast, it was beautiful, I was beautiful... My hair was stunning until it got coated with salt and tangled by the wind. I'm used to looking how I feel, like SHIT!   My many attempts at being a "girly girl" have always failed. I have tried giving up, every time I muster up the courage to look at myself in the mirror, I think,  maybe I wouldn't be alone if I actually cared how I look . I realize that it's in my head. I am alone because I want to be. I am alone because I am not settling. I am alone because my soulmate lives halfway across the globe. I am alone... sometimes I am lonely, sometimes I am not.  I am a woman, whether I wear make-up or not, does not make me more or less of a woman. If dolling myself up is what it takes to get a man, then I don't want that man. Dolling myself up makes me feel like trailer trash in new shoes. Dolling myself up makes me feel like I'm trying to be something that I'm not. Shaun thought I was good enough just the way I was, nothing added. He told me I was beautiful when I woke up in the morning BEFORE a shower. HE MADE ME FEEL GOOD. I was more attractive when I was with him, because feeling good attracts people...   I am stronger than I think I am. I am stronger because I can admit what I need. I might be less attractive because I don't feel so good most of the time. But I'm getting back to that. Just don't rush me...  Today, my left wrist is killing me... Carpal Tunnel. Hmm... Is it from typing or is it from an excessive amount of masturbation... You decide... and please... don't tell me.

      I've known for a long time that I have no shame... I can count the people that have the ability to make me feel shame or embarrassment on 1 hand... I am down right brazen according to some. I am not afraid to ask questions that I want the answers to. I am not ashamed to defend myself verbally or otherwise. Is there something wrong with this? No... I don't think so. Yet, people always seem surprised when I ask these " sordid " questions. They show their astonishment by saying: "I can't believe you said/asked that!"  Example: A rather unintelligent man that I had the displeasure of fucking, had the nerve to ask ME in front of MY mother if I enjoyed sex with him. Since he made the move on being uncouth, I obliged him with my answer:   "I've had better. Your penis is pretty small, you don't believe in foreplay and I've seen higher stamina in a bunny rabbit. You probably could be better if you'd put EFFORT into sex."  He later attempted to chastise me for making said comments. "I can't believe you said that, in front of your mother!" I corrected him immediately by stating:   "You ASKED me in front of my mother, so I TOLD you. If you didn't want to hear the answer, you shouldn't have asked the question."  He believed the sun rose over the ocean. I pointed out that it did... On the EAST coast. Then asked him where HE thought we were...  He's known to my sister simply as "man boobs". Nothing against men with titties... But this dude was an ASSHOLE. I was high, that's my excuse.   Just reliving some bad memories today. I hope this made someone laugh.

      yo ho ho and a bottle of rum... I once drank 1/2 a bottle of rum in one go, with 2 litres of Coca~Cola... I ended up on the kitchen floor with a case of the shakes, medically known as alcohol poisoning. Gee, I'm smart. Come on though, if you're going to fuck yourself up, you may as well do it right!!!  Anyway, I thought I would put a short post on Saturday and say to anyone who is reading this... Get a life... Nah, I'm only teasing. Thank You for reading.   I cannot seem to upgrade to receive feedback and I would genuinely love to know what you think. Please e-mail me your comments/responses/death threats to  sarah_laughs@hotmail.com  and make sure to put  BLOG!  in the subject line so I won't think it's porn-spam and delete it! I hope you are having a wonderful weekend.

      So yesterday, in addition to the response in quotes...    Me : "I'm going to pretend that you said that you will be my valentine. :op I can be delusional if I want to be."  He knows when he's been bested. I always get the last word... In my own  head anyway.   I am a fungus, I will grow on you. You know you love me, you know you want me... The proof was in your loins when we last saw each other... You know I always liked kissing you there.

Me:   you suck... no really... you do.  "The best valentine's day I ever had was because of you",  so you truly suck... a whole bunch.  "Not that it matters, just thought you should know."

      How much do I suck? I didn't post yesterday. I didn't feel like it. So there...  I love the song  Underneath It All  by No Doubt. I've listened to it 3 times already this morning. I feel that it represents... Yeah, I said that.  There's times when I want something more Someone more like me There's times when this dress rehearsal Seems incomplete But you see the colors in me Like no one else And behind your dark glasses  You're something else   You're really lovely Underneath it all You want to love me Underneath it all I'm really lucky Underneath it all You're really lovely   You know some real bad tricks And you need some discipline But lately you've been trying real hard And giving me your best And you give me the most gorgeous sleep That I've ever had And when it's really bad I guess it's not that bad   You're really lovely Underneath it all You want to love me Underneath it all I'm really lucky Underneath it all You're really lovely   So many moons that we have seen Stumbling back next to me I've seen right through and underneath And you make me better I've seen right through and underneath And you make me better  You are my real Prince Charmin' Like the heat from the fire You were always burnin' And each time you're around My body keeps stalin' For your touch Your kisses and your sweet romancin' There's an underside to you That so many adore Aside from your temper Everything else secure You're good for me, baby Oh that, I'm sure Over and over again I want more  You've used up all your coupons And all you got left is me And somehow I'm full of forgiveness I guess it's meant to be...   You're really lovely Underneath it all You want to love me Underneath it all I'm really lucky Underneath it all You're really lovely

      I think other people's problems are way more interesting than mine... That and if I concentrate on their problems, I don't have to face my own. It's the perfect situation really.  I can't tell you what happened with Shaun... Maybe because I don't know myself. I feel like we're in limbo. We've promised each other to stay in contact. Want to see each other again...  If I could give all my love to you. I could justify myself but I'm just not coming through. You're a pill to ease the pain of all the stupid things I do. I'm an anchor on the line of the clock that tells the time, that is running out on you.  So what else is there to tell? I can agonize over the details until I turn blue in the face or I can try to carve out a life for myself just in case we don't end up together.  The plans I make still have you in them...  I guess I should actually make other plans. Because  What brings me down now... Is love... Cuz I can never get enough.  I can no longer get drunk on 7th of August because I am not supposed to drink alcohol while on Wellbutrin. He didn't remember  What day is this? Besides the day you left me... What day is this? Besides the day you went?  He just remembered that it was before Sept. 11th '01. He did tell me that he was single for nearly a year after us because he realized what he had given up... I am still single, it's coming up on 3 years... He's loved 2 other women since me (he no longer loves them now, so he says) I have told 1 person that I loved him but in my defense, I was high & I didn't mean it. Thank God I don't get high anymore.  I must eat the dessert someone left on my desk, it looks DELICIOUSLY like heartburn.  A parting thought before impending heartburn:   It's strange because when we were together I was at the place that I eventually wanted to be at... problem was I was about 5 years ahead of myself.   written by Shaun on 3rd of January 2004. It's mine now by GOD, I can share it.  I liked it so much, I printed it out and taped it to my computer monitor, so I can read it everyday. *sigh* SO pathetic. You silly bastard, WHY DO YOU KEEP ALL THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF ME IF YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU LOVE ME ANYMORE!?!?!

      This is not to say that I won't write about Shaun and express my feelings... But, the letters that were written to him will remain just that... to him alone. I would not want to damage the feeling of being held special. Although, if he created a blog about me and went on and on about me and published e-mails and letters he had written about me, I would be flattered. Because I would feel like he wanted the whole world to know that he loved me. But we are 2 different people and feelings must be respected.  Anyway... I thought I would add this:  I saw one of the funniest things in a long time today on my lunch break... There was a black Geo Metro (think Ford Fiesta) in front of me and a sticker on the back window reading " Pimpin' It " Now I'm not against being comfortable with yourself and doing things to make yer car cool... But COME ON! " Pimpin' It " belongs on nothing less than a Cadillac. (the original pimp car) Unless of course you are a pimp of crack whores... Then it's just not funny. I have to tell you that it was a woman driving the car as well... To read correctly shouldn't it have been "Madamming It" ? She also had a bumper sticker that read: " Are those your eyeballs... Cuz I found them on my ASS !" Needless to say, I had to check her out as I drove past...   I can honestly say... Those aren't my eyeballs she found.

      OK, after posting that last love letter. I had to go back and take it off... I have to figure out  WHY  it is therapeutic to put my inner most thoughts to text and make them public.   Shaun is an extremely private man. If he knew that I was making all of this potentially very public, he would be  VERY  pissed off at me. After considering this... And doing a quick Google search... (I love Google, but I ain't gonna wear their shit) I found out that by typing in Sarahlaughs, my blog page comes up like 3rd on the list. This would not be good. Sarah Laughs Photography is the name of my business (like a dumb ass, I gave him one of my business cards, he won't throw it away, the man still has photos of me and love letters from when we were together ie... he doesn't throw things (about me) out) Should he have the same affinity for search engines that I do (which I believe he does) and he got curious about my business... Potentially very catastrophic. Especially considering I don't have a damn website for my business yet!  Then again, maybe I am paranoid... Not to make Shaun out to be some beast that doesn't let me share my emotions. Quite the opposite, he's always believed that our relationship is ours and no one elses. I can respect that opinion, I don't agree with it, but I respect it. I need to get off that kick anyhow... Right, ya'll don't need to know what a hopeless git I am.

      OK... I am weirded out. When I clicked a link to see my page. I noticed that the advert up at the top was for body piercing jewelry... Just so happens that I have a couple, I've written about them on this page... Have the marketing geniuses at Blogger.com been reading my shit and catering to my needs?! Or have I searched for something on Google? OK, let me just say that I would probably never buy body jewelry off of the net. I buy it from my piercer... If I didn't, the pieces of my body that I have pierced would probably fall off. Not to scare anyone, it's just my tongue and my left nostril. But seeing that I need my tongue and I like my nose, I don't want these pieces to fall off. Nuff said. *GASP!* I've Googled for tattoo flash... Maybe that's it. Speaking of Google, did you know that there is Google merchandise? Watches, shirts, hats, condoms... etc... (wanna Google me baby?!)  Does anyone read this? :*( I don't suppose I write here for acclaim, I do it for therapy. If anyone reads and enjoys or learns something from it, that would be a major bonus... I like helping people.  IF anyone does read this and you are pissed off at me because I'm not writing about Shaun. I am sorry. I am working on it, I really am. It's amazing how so much can happen in a matter of 2 days. I guess I just feel sick because I don't know anymore... No... nausea is a side-affect of Wellbutrin.   I love being a bitch. My sister has had 2 mobile phones that the # key has stopped working on. She went into the Verizon store to return the second one and the customer service help was completely rude to her and told her that her phone  DID  work, that she was doing something wrong. She completely dismissed my sister... So... I went to the Verizon store with my sister after work. We had to wait 15 minutes to even get helped. She noted my sister when we walked in and I think she purposely took her time with the customer she was with to make us wait longer. I truly don't believe this bitch gives a shit enough to spend any more time with customers than she absolutely HAS to. This was fine by me, gave me more time to get nice and pissed off. Finally, our turn arrived. I smiled, handed her the phone and said.    Me : "The # key does not work on this phone. Would you kindly replace it?"  Customer Service Bitch: She got instantly snotty... "What's your phone number?! This is the one that can't get into her voicemail..."   Me : I took a deep breath. "You don't need her phone number to get into the voicemail, you dial *86."   CSB : "No, it's #86!"   Me : "Oh, I'm pretty sure it's *86... then you dial #, then the passcode, then # again."   CSB : Starts fucking with the phone, dials in to VM, does not admit that yes, it's *86. "What's your passcode again?"    Me : "****"   CSB : punches in the code, then hits the # key. Doesn't put the phone up to her ear to actually see if her frantic poking of keys is doing any good.   Me : "If you'd  LISTEN  when you hit the # key, you'd know that it doesn't work."   CSB : Ignoring me, hangs up phone, phone beeps. The beep actually surprises her.   Me : "You've just sent that phone a voicemail because the # key doesn't work."   CSB : "Well, it  was  working this morning."   Me : *sigh* exhausted with her attitude. " No  it wasn't."   CSB : "I guess we can exchange it, one more time"   Me : "Yes, that would be nice and if the new one stops working, we'll be back."   CSB : Glaring at me, punches in her security code to get into the supply room.  I finally look over at my sister, who is red in the face because she's suppressing laughter.   CSB : Returns unwrapping a new phone.    Me : I smile at her, take one of her manager's business cards and then one of hers, I tuck them away in my wallet.   CSB : Smiles weakly. She realizes she should stop being a bitch. "I'm sorry, I guess I should have just replaced the phone this morning."   My sister : "Oh, that's OK, don't worry about it."   Me : *thinking* My sister has enjoyed this WAY too much, that's why it's OK with her.  We wander a bit, looking at all the accessories and hands-free devices. I make a mental note that everything in the store seems to be $29.99.   CSB : Handing me the phone. "OK, it's all done, if you'll just make sure you can get into the voicemail."   Me : "Thank You."   I go through the motions and clear a total of 8 messages out of my sister's VM box, including one of me saying "If you'd LISTEN..." to the CSB. I laugh when I hear this one. The CSB is clearing all her stuff off the counter, putting it away... It's 5pm, this bitch is leaving. This kind of irritates me. I hang up the phone and wait for her to return.   Me : knowing that she hasn't... "Have you transferred her phonebook?"   CSB : Actually fucking ROLLS her eyes at me. "No..." Hoping that I'll change my mind.   Me : "Well, would you be so kind as to do that...." Not a question, but a demand.   CSB : "Yes, of course." She disappears back into the supply room, she's probably silently screaming. She returns and says: "Gee, I hope I have the right phone."   Me : "Hmmm... Me to, I'd hate you to have to do it again."   CSB : "Oh, I'm only joking, it's the right one."   Me : "ha... ha..."  She begins the process of transferring the phone book. We're talking 5 minutes out of her precious fucking time... After a couple of beeps, the process is done, she hands me the phone.   CSB : "If you'd just make sure the correct numbers are on there."  I scroll through, everything is in order.   Me : "Thank You, so much. You've been wonderful."   CSB : Already headed back through the supply room door says nothing.  We walk out of the store, I dial *86 once more to make sure the # key is working. I'm kind of disappointed that it does. I'd love to go back and spend more time with my new friend...

      i want to report that my day has gotten better... although very slowly. maybe it hasn't at all, i've just gotten better at dealing with it!  i did get the opportunity to flip a driver "the finger" while returning from my lunch break. it felt good.  i have had a few pieces of good news though. i made about $100 more this pay check than anticipated, to which i say, yay, i can feed my dog. and i found out that i don't owe my estate $224 (bankruptcy). AND i get to keep my tax refunds... what does this mean? new tires. rent. groceries. prescriptions... actually being able to sleep at night. i might even be able to afford a trip to portland to visit/photograph the japanese gardens. it is spring... all of those lovely cherry trees are in bloom... i will also get to take a hiking trip to silver falls (to photograph the crap out of things there), which i didn't get to do last year. yes... when i look at life THIS way it actually IS looking pretty damn good.

      yes it has...  nothing new on the front of weird and wonderful... i haven't said anything particularly note-worthy along the lines of embarrassing/humiliating to my friends in public. then again, i haven't been in public with the friend that is easy to embarrass/humiliate since the last time i embarrassed/humiliated her... that probably says something, doesn't it?  i met a new friend last night. he is all that i expected him to be. i love it when people are exactly what they say they are. i was nervous right up until the point that i walked out to my car and saw him sitting on the curb reading a book. i hope i get to see him again. i suppose if i don't, i can look back on it as one of the good experiences in my life.  i will try to write more frequently...

      this conversation took place over lunch at mongolian grill in eugene yesterday afternoon with 2 of my friends from work, who happen to be dating...   guy friend : one of these days, i want to get her into castle superstore...   me : hey, i haven't been there yet. i still say we make it a field trip.   guy friend : good idea, i still can't get HER to go in though.   girl friend : what kind of stuff do they have in there... i've never been in one of those places before.   me : FUCK! you're 32 years old "H"! you're more fucking sheltered than i am!   girl friend : those places are just gross...   guy friend : not all THAT stuff is out in the open.   me : yeah, they have joke stuff, t-shirts, all sorts of fun stuff.   girl friend : joke stuff? cool!   guy friend : then there's the 3 foot wang hanging on the wall...   me : (pretending to bow down to the 3 foot wang) isn't it beautiful?!   girl friend : people don't actually USE that though...   me : with enough lube "H"... anything is possible.  she's gagging... he's laughing so hard that he's not making a sound and his face is red. i just continue to shovel noodles and beef into my mouth. as if my comment were the most natural explanation in the world. i didn't tell them that i've had 3 men ask if i would strap one on and fuck them in the ass... i think "H" would have tossed her cookies.

      i hate to say that i've been too busy to write, because that's just a load... me busy? yeah, i'm so busy, i find time to read every single evening.   i think i need to redirect my focus.   i need to use my powers for good instead of evil...  i'm just feeling sorry for myself. my personal trainer lectured me the last time that i saw him about reading while working out...   "if you can read..." he started "you're not putting enough into your work-out."   he went on to tell me that listening to music and zoning on it was a perfectly acceptable alternative. i meant to ask about the book clips on the treadmills.. why they were there, but i started fearing for my personal well-being when he told me not to do it. like i could possibly hurt myself or those i love by reading while on a treadmill...   i had a dream the other night that i was going about my business on a stationary bike, reading my book and he came by and ripped it away from my eyes and dashed it to the floor. scary thing is, i think he might find that to be a perfectly acceptable thing to do...   go on wit yer bad self.

      i have joined a gym... not that i think it will do me a lot of good. i think the personal trainer is trying to kill me already. turns out i went to school with him for 2 years, but since i was never there... i don't remember him. he says he was a trouble maker anyway, if i did see him, it was probably in the principal's office. he seems like a nice enough guy. i've started doing his "plan" that he worked up for me. i've been eating 5 small meals a day as apposed to 2 meals of whatever i can get my hands on. and i've been walking. i walked last night and when i got home and took my shoes off, i had a blister the size of south africa on my heal. FUCK it hurt. i didn't even feel it forming as i was truckin' along outside.  ah yes and my dog Dottie (LooLoo to those who know her well), who is more than willing to walk with me, got attacked. she got her juicy beak bitten by a boston bull terrior named sarah... little bitchy sarah was standing out in the road when we were tring to walk by, she stepped out in front of my dog (my dog is a pretty big) and stood there. my dog bent down to do the duties of sniffing noses and sarah bit her juicy beak! right on the end! i heard my dog cry, then growl as she bit down on sarah's head. i pulled her back and sarah was going to go after her again and i said: "do it dog and i'll punt you like a fucking football!" she looked up at me and ran into her yard. stupid beotch. i didn't want to kick her, she's old. but come on, i'm not going to let her chew on my dog!!!  i got home, ravinous, i ate dinner which consisted of rice and a tamale... needless to say, i put myself into a food coma.

      hmm, yes well, i've been thinking... i know, big mistake.  we're laying in bed, enjoying the moment. no, not the moment after sex. we're fully clothed, laying on top of the covers, my shoes are even on. we are just enjoying the moment, you know, being together again after such a long break. oaths were made about friendship, i had a weak moment (one of many) and bawled my eyes nearly out of my head, he held me... like he used to, every night when we were together. my head laying on his chest, his arms around me. his left hand stroking my hair. i feel soothed. i haven't felt that way in 3 years. i'm turned on too, but i never denied the fact that i still love him. i never wanted to be just friends, that was his idea. he had made this speech the night before;  "i can't be more than friends with you right now, i can't give you more than that at this moment."   this was one of the few times he actually looked me in the eyes over those 2 days, but i couldn't meet his gaze. i was afraid of what he would see. the eyes are the windows to the soul, i didn't want him to have to see how much that hurt to hear. he knows it anyway, but i didn't want to let him see how much it  really  hurt. i don't think he deserves to feel more guilty than he already does.   remembering that conversation from the day before makes me sad and i crawl over to him and he graciously opens his arms and says;  "aw, come here now, it's going to be ok."  he wants to hold me as much as i want to be held. there is no denying it and there is no shame in it either. at that moment, i know that he cares about me, as much as i care about him.   this is where i began telling it, laying in bed, enjoying the moment. we're like that for what seems to be hours. but i suppose it may have been one. i fell asleep in there and woke up again. in between i ask him if he wants to see me again. he begins by telling me that he doesn't know how long it will be before we can. i interrupt and ask again. he starts up with telling me he doesn't know when. i interrupt and ask again. he finally simply answers 'yes'.  "that's all that matters then. that you want to."  i lay back down, feeling relief beyond relief...   i tease him about his belt as it doesn't hold anything up, it's just looped around his waist. i pull it out and ask what the point of it is? this makes him giggle and he says it's merely a fashion statement as he tightens it back up again. i say something else, then pull his belt loose once more stating that it's not holding ANYTHING up. again he laughs and places it back where it was. we look at each other then, for a long moment. i want to kiss him. he can see it. he announces that he has to use the toilet. i move away from him.   when he closes the bathroom door, i slam onto my back on the bed with a heavy sigh. he's in there for a few minutes, i hear the toilet flush, washing of hands, the door opens. i'm looking at the ceiling, but i can feel he's looking at me. he walks back over to the bed and sits instead of laying down. he tells me that his neck is getting sore and that he's getting tired, he doesn't want to fall asleep. i lean over and put my head in his lap. his left hand at his thigh, ends up nearly holding my breast, had it been palm up. he makes no effort to move it. at this moment, i feel why he made his trip to the bathroom. his hard-on is throbbing against the top of my head. it's not uncomfortable for me, but i can feel that it's awkward for him. i close my eyes and wish that he'd kiss me, wish that he'd touch me... i want to know him like i used to. i know it won't happen though. he refuses to make this any more difficult for either one of us than it has to be. i look up at him and smile, he knows that i know and he smiles back and swallows hard.   i lay my head down again, but this time on the pillow. he asks if i want to go for a drive, i feel sick, i feel like he doesn't want to be alone with me. looking back now i realize that he was having a hard time holding himself back and it would have been easier if we were in a car instead of laying on a bed. i tell him that i have a lot of driving ahead of me tomorrow. he agrees and decides to lay back down after i promise him that if he falls asleep that i will wake him up and take him back to his room. i confess now, that i would have watched him sleep for a while before waking him.   he asks for a detailed recall of my day. i oblige. resting my hand casually and dangerously on his hip. looking him directly in the eyes while recounting the boring details... i feel him shifting under my hand. he's actually trying for an "accidental" touch. i let my hand brush lightly against his groin, just enough that i can feel that he's still hard. this time i'm the one that feels heat rising in my body and i have a hard time swallowing. i cease speaking at this time. the silence spreads across the room, but it's not uncomfortable, it never has been with him. i want him so much that if i were standing, my knees would shake. he feels it too. but the moment, of course, passes.   he says he's going to have to go soon. i ask if i can take his picture. he says "of course". i was surprised, he never let me take his picture when we were together, unless i begged. i took his picture, he is beautiful. a lot of things were exchanged - said - reaffirmed. a lot of which are none of anyone's business... i feel lucky to have had the experience. i am writing this for posterity, maybe... or maybe because i need to feel that i've had something special. we hugged each other a lot, probably not as much as we wanted. i drove him back to his room. got out of the car, we hugged again.   i mutter that "i can't stand the fact that we have to say good-bye."  he squeezes me tighter and says "you can't think about that now."   i noticed how things have changed. he hugs differently now. better, if that is possible. i feel his hands slip from around my waist and he looks into my eyes one last time, then turns and walks away.  saying over his shoulder "you take care of yourself."  i watch him walk away, wanting to go after him. i don't want to leave his side ever again, but am faced with the reality that i HAVE to. i can't tear my eyes away from him, he keeps his head focused in front of him, putting one foot in front of the other. i watch him until he disappears into the elevator. tears are streaming down my face and i have a lump in my throat the size of an elephant. i stand there for a few seconds longer, hoping that he'll come back out, then turn and walk to my car, open the door and sit down. i'm in a daze, did all of this really happen..? it must have, it hurts like hell. i put my head in my hands and cry for all the loneliness in my heart. a mixture of relief for seeing him again and pain for having to leave. somehow i drove back to my room and fell asleep. i woke in the morning and drove back to oregon.

      Maybe different but remember  Winters warm there you and I  Kissing whiskey by the fire  With the snow outside  And the summer comes  The river swims at midnight shiver cold  Touch the bottom you and I  With muddy toes   Stay or leave I want you not to go but you should It was good as good goes  Stay or leave I want you not to go but you did   Wake up naked drinking coffee  Making plans to change the world  While the world is changing us  It was good good love  You used to laugh under the covers  Maybe not so often now  The way I used to laugh with you  Was loud and hard   Stay or leave  I want you not to go but you should  It was good as good goes  Stay or leave I want you not to go but you did   So what to do  With the rest of the day's afternoon hey  Isn't it strange how we change  Everything we did  Did I do all that I should   That I coulda done  Remember we used to dance  And everyone wanted to be  You and me  I want to be too  What day is this  Besides the day you left me  What day is this Besides the day you went  So what to do  With the rest of the day's afternoon hey  Well isn't it strange how we change  Everything we did  Did I do all that I could   Remember we used to dance  And everyone wanted to be  You and me, I want to be too What day is this  Besides the day you went babe  What day is this?

      well, there isn't anything plain and simple about narcissistic behavior, but when it comes to describing someone as a narcissist, they either are or they are not. that part IS plain and simple.   i think most of us can agree that we have become self-centered narcissist assholes at one point or another in our lives... :-) we think it ALL revolves around us, then we are bitch slapped back into reality, well some of us are...   - Bulfinch's Mythology   The Age of Fable    ECHO AND NARCISSUS     Echo was a beautiful nymph, fond of the woods and hills, where she devoted herself to woodland sports. She was a favourite of Diana, and attended her in the chase. But Echo had one failing; she was fond of talking, and whether in chat or argument, would have the last word. One day Juno was seeking her husband, who, she had reason to fear, was amusing himself among the nymphs. Echo by her talk contrived to detain the goddess till the nymphs made their escape. When Juno discovered it, she passed sentence upon Echo in these words: "You shall forfeit the use of that tongue with which you have cheated me, except for that one purpose you are so fond of- reply. You shall still have the last word, but no power to speak first."   This nymph saw Narcissus, a beautiful youth, as he pursued the chase upon the mountains. She loved him and followed his footsteps. O how she longed to address him in the softest accents, and win him to converse! but it was not in her power. She waited with impatience for him to speak first, and had her answer ready. One day the youth, being separated from his companions, shouted aloud, "Who's here?" Echo replied, "Here." Narcissus looked around, but seeing no one, called out, "Come." Echo answered, "Come." As no one came, Narcissus called again, "Why do you shun me?" Echo asked the same question. "Let us join one another," said the youth. The maid answered with all her heart in the same words, and hastened to the spot, ready to throw her arms about his neck. He started back, exclaiming, "Hands off! I would rather die than you should have me!" "Have me," said she; but it was all in vain. He left her, and she went to hide her blushes in the recesses of the woods. From that time forth she lived in caves and among mountain cliffs. Her form faded with grief, till at last all her flesh shrank away. Her bones were changed into rocks and there was nothing left of her but her voice. With that she is still ready to reply to any one who calls her, and keeps up her old habit of having the last word.   There was a clear fountain, with water like silver, to which the shepherds never drove their flocks, nor the mountain goats resorted, nor any of the beasts of the forests; neither was it defaced with fallen leaves or branches; but the grass grew fresh around it, and the rocks sheltered it from the sun. Hither came one day the youth, fatigued with hunting, heated and thirsty. He stooped down to drink, and saw his own image in the water; he thought it was some beautiful water-spirit living in the fountain.  He stood gazing with admiration at those bright eyes, those locks curled like the locks of Bacchus or Apollo, the rounded cheeks, the ivory neck, the parted lips, and the glow of health and exercise over all. He fell in love with himself. He brought his lips near to take a kiss; he plunged his arms in to embrace the beloved object. It fled at the touch, but returned again after a moment and renewed the fascination. He could not tear himself away; he lost all thought of food or rest. while he hovered over the brink of the fountain gazing upon his own image. He talked with the supposed spirit: "Why, beautiful being, do you shun me? Surely my face is not one to repel you. The nymphs love me, and you yourself look not indifferent upon me. When I stretch forth my arms you do the same; and you smile upon me and answer my beckonings with the like." His tears fell into the water and disturbed the image. As he saw it depart, he exclaimed, "Stay, I entreat you! Let me at least gaze upon you, if I may not touch you." With this, and much more of the same kind, he cherished the flame that consumed him, so that by degrees be lost his colour, his vigour, and the beauty which formerly had so charmed the nymph Echo. She kept near him, however, and when he exclaimed, "Alas! alas! she answered him with the same words. He pined away and died; and when his shade passed the Stygian river, it leaned over the boat to catch a look of itself in the waters. The nymphs mourned for him, especially the water-nymphs; and when they smote their breasts Echo smote hers also. They prepared a funeral pire and would have burned the body, but it was nowhere to be found; but in its place a flower, purple within, and surrounded with white leaves, which bears the name and preserves the memory of Narcissus.   my point being... i thought maybe i didn't HAVE one there for a second. is that as humans, i think we need to be humbled. we have become too big for our britches, so to speak. we aren't the most important things on earth, we're just a part of an intricate loop... i refuse to launch into a green peace speech. suffice to say that i have strong beliefs in living beneath my means. i don't do things JUST BECAUSE I CAN. i'm not saying that i'm perfect, far from it. but i think we could all take a page out of the book of humbleness and humility and realize that we need to get a grip on ourselves.  that is all...

      Let me just say that i'm disgusted at this juncture... there is this attractive woman on the t.v. (i'm at the front desk, it's on, i'm watching)   the part that's disgusting is that her legs are shiny... and she's wearing blue eye shadow... when did blue eye shadow come back?    not that i'm a make-up expert...    it probably never went out for gorgeous blondes...    bitch...

      when the high point is a miniature stapler that uses standard staples that happen to be blue instead of silver, you know your life has reached a new low level, to say the least...  there are a couple of answers to this carnage that i refer to as a social life.. i use the term loosely. one might be "you need to get laid." another might be "just deal with it." since i don't think sex, the anonymous one-night-stand variety, is the answer to life's problems.. i'm going to go with the latter of the suggestions.   now committed.. monogamous sex, that IS the answer to all of life's problems, it can cure just about everything that ails you. from a headache and menstrual cramps (sorry ladies) to a bad attitude... have you ever considered the fact that you HAVE a headache is a sign that you NEED release in your life.. you should.  on to other matters..  i was eating lunch today, mowing down on some nachos, watching i don't know what on FX, when my friend Scott came in and changed the channel to Sci-Fi to watch some classic trek while he dined on hamburgers...  seizing the opportunity, because he takes so many liberties with me. i pipe up: i should point out that he shares the birthday of my ex-long-term-relationship and also many many traits.. many irritating traits.  me: hey! i was watching that...  scott: so..  me: so damn it, i got here first, that should count for something!  scott: you know i always come in here and watch trek while i eat lunch.  me: SO! B.F.D. man! what about compromise? (pseudo anger, i really don't give a flying fuck what's on TV)  scott: well what do you want to watch?  me: (realizing the sudden change in tone) scott, just watch yer trek, it doesn't matter.  scott: no, you're right, you were here first..  me: no, really, it doesn't matter, it's just tv, i don't care what's on.  scott: well what do you want to watch?  me: i really REALLY don't care scott, watch trek.  scott: (silently regarding me)  me: seriously, let it go, watch trek..  scott: i just want to do what makes you happy..  me: (eyes widening) dude, just drop it, watch trek, i don't care. tv isn't something that makes me happy or sad.  scott: (getting up starts flipping through channels)  me: (thinking, good, he's going to put it back on trek)  scott: (he stops on comedy central, sits back down) i've seen that one anyway...  me: *sigh* (great)  it's not such a good thing for people to let on that they actually give a flying fuck how i think or feel.. sometimes, i'll just take advantage of that fact. i'm only kidding.. but it is sort of frightening, i was just fucking around.

      i often wonder if i should approach every aspect of my life as cautiously as i do a financial investment...  it's life.. it's more important than money. i don't hold a high opinion of money, but it is a necessary evil. i don't make that much, so i don't really want to squander what i have.  the same could be said of life. i don't know how much i have, so i shouldn't squander it either. money.. i know how much i make, i know how much i can spend. i don't get that security with life and how i live it. that is... unfair.. to say the least, but then.. that's how it goes.  would you really want to know how much life you get? if you knew, wouldn't that put a damper on how you spent it?   if you had no knowledge of how much money you have or how much you can spend.. would it be the same? unlimited funds is like not knowing when you will die? should i even be comparing the two? i don't think so.  just a thought.. from a thinker..

      i actually feel guilty if i develop feelings for more than one man at a time. why do i feel guilty? it's natural to have feelings for people that happen upon us in our times of need or even in just times of ... nothing.  i must investigate why i have these feelings of guilt when i have genuine affection, plutonic or otherwise.

      it lasted for 2 days... i guess the only way i could compare a migraine to anything on earth is this way:  get someone to beat you about the head and neck with a baseball bat, when you stop vomitting and your head floats back down to your body, have them whack at it again. repeat for hours on end... the exception being eventually, a baseball bat will kill you... a migraine will just make you wish you were dead.  i become hypersensative to light, sound, smell and bad attitudes.  it's a neurological disorder.

      i had been planning on talking with my ex either on the net or on the phone today for, oh... months.   1.) he didn't send me an e-mail giving me a time he would be available. probably because he didn't fucking know himself. he's doing family things today, it's easter... even in london.  2.) he didn't give me a number to phone him at. because he didn't know when he was going to be home.  why it just doesn't matter:   1.) i can't log onto AIM anyway.   2.) he's not fucking home.  oh and... he just fucking e-mailed me to tell me he's still at his grandparents house. he's checking his e-mail AT his grandparents house because he wanted to chat today. it just fucking sucks. things with us are so fucked up and hopeless.

      i just like saying the word random...  i have tried to express myself in many ways. it seems that i'm hardly ever understood. i'm beginning to think maybe it's my delivery. i expect too much out of people. very few of them can actually follow along with my thought process and carry on a conversation with me.   some men have the inherent habit of bringing up subjects that i've expressly tried to avoid. or even stated out right that i don't want to discuss. these aren't... painful subjects or need to know subjects, they are just curious and stupid enough to let it get the better of them. if i say... "i don't want to talk about this." i really mean "I DON'T WANT TO FUCKING TALK ABOUT IT!" not... "please... gently persuade me to talk about it by acting like a jackass..."   i'm through venting my random thoughts randomly...   oh... i temporarily lost my phone this morning... i was so fucking pissed off. it was such a dumb reason to get pissed, but it was like i couldn't help it.  oh and... i won't be talking to my ex tomorrow as planned... he didn't e-mail me the time he wished this to take place... i'm not going to wait around all fucking day.   happy easter.

      i was inspired by cw of wittandwisdom.com...   i had the privilege of eating lunch with the women in my family today. my 2 sisters, my mom, my grandma and my 17-month-old niece hanna, who i refer to as dirty brown.   i think of how our family has evolved over the years and i remember when i was just a little older than dirty... wow... time goes fast.  point of this post:  dirty brown was shoving noodles in her mouth, a handful at a time. she paused, noodle en route and looked at her mother she smiled, grabbed my sister's hand. she bent down and made to kiss it, then shifted at the last moment and bit her instead. my sister has the patience of a saint... i am watching all of this, trying my best not to laugh. rachel (d.b's ma) tapped her baby lightly on the lips to let her know that this was not OK. dirty's normally large round brown eyes narrowed to slits and she ravenously bit her ma's hand again. this time, rachel thumped her lightly on the nose. this did the trick, dirty was pissed, not hurt... just pissed. she thrust her lower lip out and tried her hardest to cry. (she wasn't successful) she went back to flirting with the waitress as if the incident had never happened.  i tried my hardest to hide the fact that i was laughing my ass off.  it was a good day.

       Corporate Lesson 1   A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. After a few seconds of arguing over which one should go and answer the door, the wife gives up, quickly wraps herself up in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next-door neighbor.   Before she could say a word, Bob says, "I'll give you $800 to drop that towel that you have on."   After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob. After a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 and leaves. Confused, but excited about her good fortune, the woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs.   When she gets back to the bathroom, her husband asks from the shower, "Who was that?"   "It was Bob the next door neighbor," she replies.   "Great!" the husband says, "Did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?"    Moral of the story :  If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.   Corporate Lesson 2   A priest was driving along and saw a nun on the side of the road. He stopped and offered her a lift, which she accepted. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to open and reveal a lovely leg. The priest had a look and nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg.   The nun looked at him and immediately said, "Father, remember Psalm 129?"  The priest was flustered and apologized profusely. He forced himself to remove his hand.... Changing gear, he let his hand slide up her leg again.   The nun once again said, "Father, remember Psalm 129?"  Once again the priest apologized, "Sorry, Sister, but the flesh is weak."  Arriving at the convent, the nun got out gave him a meaningful glance and went on her way. Upon his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to retrieve a Bible and looked up Psalm 129.   It Said, "Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory."   Moral of the story:   If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity.   Corporate Lesson 3   A sales representative, an administration clerk, and their manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out in a puff of smoke.   The Genie says, "I usually only grant three wishes, so I'll give each of you just one."  "Me first! Me first!" says the admin clerk. "I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world."   Poof! She's gone.  "Me next! Me next!" says the sales rep. "I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with a personal masseuse, an endless supply of pina coladas, and the love of my life."   Poof! He's gone.  "OK, you're up," the Genie says to the manager.  The manager says, "I want those two back in the office after lunch."   Moral of the story:   Always let your boss have the first say.   Corporate Lesson 4   A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A small rabbit saw the crow and asked him, "Can I sit like you and do nothing all day long?"  The crow answered: "Sure, why not?"  So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow and rested. All of a sudden a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it.   Moral of the story:   To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up.   Corporate Lesson 5   A turkey was chatting with a bull. "I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree," sighed the turkey, “but I haven't got the energy."  "Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull. "They're packed with nutrients."  The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, there he was, proudly perched at the top of the tree. He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.   Moral of the story:   Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.   Corporate Lesson 6   A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. While it was lying there, a cow came by and shit on it. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow shit, it began to realize how warm it was. The shit was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy.  A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow crap, and promptly dug him out and ate him.   Moral of the story:   1) Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy. 2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 3) And when you're in deep shit, it's best to keep your mouth shut!   In Africa every morning, a gazelle awakens knowing that it must outrun the fastest lion if it wants to stay alive. Every morning a lion wakes up knowing it must run faster than the slowest gazelle or it will starve to death.   It makes no difference whether you are a lion or a gazelle: When the sun comes up, you had better be hauling ass!

      on occasion redemption lays only with oneself...   which can be the hardest forgiveness to find.  i am not feeling very funny today.  it's been 7 days since i've felt funny.  here's to the friends that make me laugh shamelessly.  you know who you are.  i love you.

      Dearest Rod,  words cannot begin to describe or explain how truly sorry i am for my actions. my behavior was uncalled for, insane, irrational and this is not including the affect that it had on you.  everyone deserves to know what i did to you. i deserve to suffer humiliation for my actions. it cannot begin to compare what i put you through.  i phoned the hospital on friday morning to see if you were there. when they asked who i was, i couldn't tell the truth, i lied and said that i was your sister.. stupid and dishonest. they of course told me that you were not there. i knew i was fucking up. i considered that maybe you hadn't checked in yet. i mulled it through my head all day and most of the evening. at around 9pm, i phoned again. they told me that there wasn't a patient registered under that name. great.. that set, i assumed the worse.  saturday, because i cannot seem to let my jealousy and mistrust rest, i phoned your house. i spoke to a woman who was NOT at all happy to hear me. i apologized and hung up. i had no right to phone you after my actions on friday. but continuing on my irrational path of destruction, i left you a nasty message calling you, what i really am: "a piece of shit".   through it all, you have remained. you are a good man and if you weren't sick, you'd probably give my sorry self another chance. i do not deserve another. you weren't nasty to me. always remaining. you simply said. "we've done this before. i can't do it again. i am tired and i am going away."  i want you with the blistering intensity of the sun. for reasons unknown to me, unreasonable insecurities and the nasty habit of playing to them follow close behind. which shoved you away. the one person i wanted. i was too afraid to let love me. i couldn't just believe you and be calm. who would love me?! i had to chase you off instead. i am admitting this now. a little too late. i should have walked away if i couldn't believe you, but i couldn't do that either. none of this is your fault. it's just a futile attempt to explain myself.  i promised not to phone you again and i will keep that promise. you do not deserve further damage from the hurricane that is me.   thank you for loving me and letting me love you.  you will always be true, honest.. golden.  -Sarah

      with each new struggle comes knowledge.  knowledge of self and knowledge of others..  i have finally learned that i set limits on how happy i will let myself be. those limits are very low. i seem to loathe myself enough to stay miserable. i truly do not deserve, am not worthy of euphoria. what a nice thing to know about myself..  i quoted ernest hemingway for my friend ivan.. he works for the forest service and basically gets paid to camp all summer. he is also a miserable bastard.. much like myself...   live and lose and learn.. then try again some day.  i knew i fucked up as soon as i did it.

      i was so sentimental about you i'd break anyone's heart for you. my, i was a fool. i broke my own heart too. it's broken and gone. everything i believed in and everything i cared about i left for you because you were so wonderful and you loved me so much that love was all that mattered. love was the greatest thing, wasn't it? love was what we had that no one else had or could ever have? and you were a genius and i was your whole life. i was your partner and your little black flower. slop! love is just another dirty lie. love is ergoapiol pills to make me come around because you were afraid to have a baby. love is quinine and quinine and quinine until i'm deaf with it. love is that dirty aborting horror that you took me to. love is my insides all messed up. it's half catheters and half whirling douches. i know about love. love always hangs up behind the bathroom door. it smells like lysol. to hell with love. love is making me happy and then going off to sleep with your mouth open while i lie awake all night afraid to say my prayers even because i know i have no right to anymore. love is all the dirty little tricks you taught me that you probably got out of some book. all right. i'm through with you and i'm through with love. your kind of pick-nose love.

      i had an interesting conversation with a co-worker/friend today about the newness in relationships. it's rosy, no doubt. i rue the day baby.. i love the newness, because as soon as it wears off, you learn that the other person is actually fucking HUMAN and that they can and will piss you off to unbelievable lengths. this is the point where you learn if it's real or not. if you want to stick with it or not.. if they fight dirty.. you have to be compatible in arguments as well as agreements.. ech..   THIS is a test.. truly. sometimes you're lucky enough to get pissed off at one another IN the newness and you find out that you still like them even though you want to throttle the crap out of them. i appreciate that fact in most of the people that i have formed lasting relationships with. i can bitch at them.. fight with them and they with me and it's all OK in the end.. i'm a realist.. none of this crap is relationship ending.. if it is, they really weren't worth it to begin with.

      ok.. for those dean koontz fans out there, that have read ALL of his books.. you know what i'm talking about here. for those of you who do not.. pick up a copy at your local library and have a read.  every single time i log onto the internet and spent endless mind-numbing hours poking away at keys or surfing for porn.. (yes i said porn) i think about this book.. i read it 10 years ago and it still wigs me out.

      i don't really have anything to write about..  sorry to my #1 fan..  i've been excessively busy at work, but i did get a nice surprise today.. my desk phone rang, i never really know who it's going to be.. lack of caller id, i suppose. i answered in my usual, "good afternoon, this is sarah." and who would it be but the one and only person i actually DID want to hear from.. *sigh* it literally made my day. (if you don't know this is you.. you're clueless)  now i'm eating clam chowder for lunch..  i'm looking forward to my aerobics class @ 5:30pm..  *right* i wish i could be at the park with you.. even if it would be to watch your kids ride their bicycles.. pathetic huh.

      it's a shitty club song.. but it is a logical question. we have to define love and what matters to us in our own way. i guess it's left up to whatever to see if it gets us what we want out of life. it's different for nearly everyone.. sometimes we get lucky to find someone that shares the definition..  we come to several crossroads.. we decide.. if it's either worth settling and accepting that this is as good as it gets.. or possibly chasing something that doesn't exist and resign ourselves to the possibility of being alone forever.   i am not afraid of being alone. i am comfortable with myself. i miss having someone, i do. i would be a liar if i didn't admit that i miss warm hugs and sweet kisses and passionate encounters. but there is more to life than that. i think what we are all ultimately seeking is something complete. maybe that's someone who stimulates us in every known way. someone we can feel so comfortable with that in silence or speech, it doesn't matter which occurs, both are equally satisfying. just being with them is enough.  i've felt comfortable with a few.. for one reason or another.. i haven't held their magic box and the more i think of it, they haven't held mine either. they have either stirred heated desires in me and completely lost me in all other aspects or i was only toying with the idea of them in the first place. i was in love with the idea of being in love.. i feel completely fool-hardy for admitting that, but it's true. i was young and stupid, like everyone once was and i was lucky it didn't go further in ruining either of our lives. maybe a cynical way of looking at it.. but when you're 20 you don't know what the hell you want in life, you shouldn't try to get married and settle down. i do not regret playing house with him.. we had fabulous times together and i learned new levels of temperament and feeling. things i wouldn't have known without him.  i am prepared.. to bask in the throws of a self-inflicted pleasure. for the rest of my life, if need be. :-)  the want should overwhelm the need.   think about it..

      I went to the Garden of Love. And saw what I never had seen: A Chapel was built in the midst, Where I used to play on the green.  And the gates of this chapel were shut, And Thou shalt not writ over the door; So I turn'd to the Garden of Love That so many sweet flowers bore.  And I saw it was filled with graves, And tomb-stones where flowers should be: And Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds, And binding with briars, my joys and desires.

      i am writing and if i keep writing miraculous shit is supposed to start flowing from the pen. i don't think i've ever written long enough for that to happen.  i feel old weak and wore out, scared, thrilled, turned on, out of my mind, lonely, excited, anxious, nervous, sure yet insecure.  i want you  i can't let others be responsible for my happiness. yet it's so easy to incorporate you into my everyday life that it's happened without my noticing.  not responsible for it, but becoming an intricate part of..

      I don’t know why you are mean to me When I call on the telephone. And I don’t know what you mean to me But I want to turn you on, turn you up, figure you out, I want to take you on   These words, "You will be mine." These words, "You will be mine." All the time.   Now fool might be my middle name But I’d be foolish not to say I’m going to make whatever it takes, Ring you up, call you down, sign your name, secret love, Make it rhyme, take you in, and make you mine.   These words, "You will be mine." These words, "You will be mine." all the time. oh   I tripped and fell. did I fall. What I want to feel, I want to feel it now   You know with love come strange currencies  And here is my appeal:   I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance, A word, a signal, a nod, a little breath Just to fool myself, to catch myself, to make it real, real   These words, "You will be mine" These words, "You will be mine." all the time. oh   These words, "You will be mine." These words, they haunt me, hunt me down, catch in my throat, make me pray, To say, this love's confines, oh.

HA! i'm kidding, i'm not that much of a err uh.. ok maybe i am.. so what?! the way my name sounds coming from his lips, it's like poetry... he's got this smile.. this laugh.. these eyes.. ugh.. it's like i'm back in high school all over again. i wasn't any good at it the first time around..

      there are very few people that i would feel comfortable enough to watch porn with on the first date..  with that out of the way, i had fun last night. i got there at 7pm and didn't leave till close to midnight. that's how comfortable it was. i had little doubt that it would be, considering the night before, we spoke on the phone for 3 hours.   let me just say that most people... don't look beyond...  they never know that i have a severely demented, highly sexual mind.. they just see a fat chick.

      6th May 2004  My dearest S,  Where do I begin? I am sorry for you. I wanted so much for us in this life. We were so happy when we were young. Where did it all go? Where did we go wrong?  I have so many things in life that I wish for you. Even though we cannot be together. I want love for you. The walk through fire kind. I want you to feel that way about a woman and I want her to feel that way about you.  I suppose, when I think about it, I should have never loved you. But I could not help myself. You were so lovely and charming and beautiful. So kind and thoughtful in how you began. It broke me to see the truth. I would rather have a heart bursting with love than a pocket full of cash. It saddens me to know that you put your own emotions aside for the love of money. You have a new mistress now, one with whom I cannot compete. I hope that it keeps you warm in your times of need and gives you some sort of fulfillment that you so desire. May you realize one day that you are worth more than petty materialistic goods and let someone love you as I did.   As I always will, despite myself.  ~Sarah

      well, ability. i used to be able to tell when he was thinking about me or if he was going to e-mail me or make contact because i would have a dream about it the night before..  thursday night i had the dream.. friday.. nothing..  which leads me to believe the impossible, i'm losing touch. losing or already lost, i guess, the connection. how did i let it slip away? i probably didn't have a fucking choice. time for pizza and beer, i'm getting drunk.

      i had.. a messed up dream last night..  my ex from london proposed to me.. he gave me this beautiful antique ring with 3 diamonds in it. i wore it and the first time i took it off, it fell apart. turned into a long piece of silk.. then my sisters started questioning his proposal and my world came crashing down. before i woke up, i had made plans to fly to london.. ARGH!  i haven't heard a peep from my ex in months. we tried to stay in contact, i thought it might work this time, but had this feeling that it wouldn't. it was of course one sided.. he was too busy with school to keep up with my e-mail.. blah blah blah.. it's been months. i don't harbor any feelings of contempt for him NOT keeping in contact with me. when we said good-bye in San Francisco in January.. i knew it was for good. well, we didn't SAY good-bye. we've never SAID good-bye.. but you understand.. surely...  just thought i'd share

      it's finally here folks!    frikkin' A yeahhh!  it's frikkin' tasty!     "Juicy Mullet"   artificially flavored  Cinnamon Gum*  yes.. you get  8  delicious pieces of this masterfully crafted.. lovingly molded gum...  we know things can get pretty crazy and you can end up with gum stuck in your mullet. NOT TOO COOL! (what.. the mullet?) but not to worry. to remove it, just rub a dime-bag sized bit of peanut butter into it and gently pull out gum. (much better than taking scissors to your bodacious beaver-pelt.) then wash that bastard out with "vibrant mullet" shampoo, dry and style.. and FRIKKIN' PARTY! PARTY!  PARRRRTAYYY !  * not intended for actual human consumption *

      so i've been house/dog-sitting for a co-worker of mine this last week. my dog.. looloo.. is extremely jealous.. passive agressive.. weird...  i went to dinner at my parents' house (this is where my dog is residing) on monday.. to dine on freshly caught alaskan halibut. mmmmm and a crisp fresh salad. hey, sometimes healthy IS good.  when i went to leave. looloo was laying on the floor, gazing up at me adoringly..   me:  bye lolly..   loo:  *turns her head AWAY from me*   me:  loo?   loo:  *turns her head FURTHER AWAY*   me:  come here and give me a hug (bending and opening arms for doggy embrace)   loo:  *gets up.. stretches.. goes under the kitchen table*   me:  FINE!

      it's all a bit much.. isn't it..  how people expect from each other, they don't accept..  always expect more.  i don't know the answer to most of life's questions.  but..  i know that j.m. is a dish..   and..  i know that i have a "date" tomorrow..   (not with j.m.)  DAMN IT!  oh well..

      i wish.. i wish i was a better writer. i don't know if writing is something that comes naturally or if it something one must work at and work at and work at.. i suppose it's like anything else in life. some people are.. naturals.. others just wish they were better, then find out they aren't that bad. i guess it's finding what you're good at??? i've been complimented a few times on the way i write. i guess i might be scared at being really good at anything because then people will pay attention to me and i never look good enough to be the center of so much attention. ech.. i need to work on myself.   "you have to like yourself before anyone can love you.."  ok.. that's not true. people love me already and i've been loathing myself for YEARS. i guess in the search for happiness or whatever.. one must be content with oneself first. at times i am.. i go through bouts of.. self-love.. comfortableness. then i'm right back at the.. i suck stage. is comfortableness even a fucking word?!?!  i've discussed settling before.. i know my sister has settled. i'm scared of settling. i'm scared of the unknown.. i'm scared of my future. maybe not so easy to admit on many levels, sure, i'm scared of being alone. i'm terrified of waking up one day and realizing i'm 40.. i’ve had 1 relationship.. and that was 2 decades ago.. i don't want to be that woman. but hey, i guess if that's what's meant for me.. i've accomplished very little so far and i'm 26.. this bothers me, but apparently not to the point that i'm willing to do anything about it. that bothers me even more.   ech.. i'm done complaining.. time to start doing.  on a good note... one of my photographs got used on a demo CD that got handed out in chicago at a music convention to like 10 major record companies...  how fuckin cool is that?

      after about 10 hours of relatively uninterrupted sleep..  i feel pretty good.  i don't want to go on and on about things.. when i get my hopes up, they always seem to get dashed..   why?   he phoned last night at around 11:30pm. said that he debated on it.. hoped that i was still awake.. was sorry for waking me. was nice to hear my voice..   cheesy confession.. i slept better after hearing his voice.

      have you ever discussed your darkest secrets and your dirtiest fantasies with anyone?  i hadn't either..  but..  i met a man on sunday..  i've talked to him every day since.  i don't want to hide myself from him. i wasn't looking for him either.. it's nice.. i like it.. i'm comfortable.. he doesn't piss me off or work me up.. or pry things from my brain.. they just flow out.. he doesn't even have to ask.  i like learning that i can be inspired and motivated in different ways.   it doesn't have to be forced.   whoa..  i'm wondering when it will stop.

      i've decided on a tattoo.. none of your business.. don't even know why i brought it up. :)  i spent.. 5 hours on the phone early sunday morning.. i watched the sun come up. we couldn't say good-bye. so we didn't.. we kind of mutually hung-up at the same time. so much for me going for the unavailable guy... something MUST be wrong. he of course laughed when i said that.  nothing else going on..   i'm exhausted.

      i've been flipping through the dictionary for post titles.. completely random.. the last 3 posts have consisted of said random titles. i think they have been rather inventive and fitting. this one makes me a bit nervous however, for unknown reasons.  it's been a bad week...  i don't know if i've been allowing people to affect my mood or if it's that i've been busy as FUCK with all the things that have happened at work. i shouldn't let that affect me either.. i'm only here 9 hours a day..   today.. another rant day.. another bullshit i want to scream until my voice completely disappears from my throat day..    i'm worth too much? what am i worth to you?   i'm frustrated.. i'm tense. i see the injustices in the world and in my own life. i hate myself even more for feeling like i have the RIGHT to be upset about the simplistic evils that sometimes occur in my life.  vicious cycle. i guess i just need to let go.

      interesting title.. but it has nothing to do with the body of today's "work".  maybe a more suitable title would have been..  a robin redbreast in a cage.. puts all of heaven in a rage..  - William Blake  last year in the middle of may.. i adopted 2 baby robins that had been knocked out of the nest by a nasty blue jay. (yes, i know this is illegal now) i kept the fledglings in a cage and fed them canned dog food and earth worms. they grew quickly and it was obvious that i was their "mom". they got excited when they saw me walking towards the cage and i even spent time in the backyard letting them stretch their little wee wings. they always ended up flying up on to my shoulder.. it was very cute, except when they shat on me. i could have done without that.   a fateful day in june arrived, i came upon a date that i had scheduled to be away in San Francisco.. i had to either give my robin redbreasts to the wild (which i planned on doing anyway but they were too young) or find someone to care for them in my absence.   as it would turn out, there is a refuge center in eugene, that i did not know about. the interesting woman that took over care of my fledglings was impressed with their health but proceeded to chastise me for the fact that they had  pooed  on one another.   they don't  poo  on each other in the wild?!  i left the amonia filled room after filling out forms about where i had acquired my fledglings.. it was a sad day and i still wonder if they were successfully released or if the interesting woman at the refuge center knocked them in the head because they had  "pooed"  on one another..

      i neglected my yahoo messenger on tuesday june 1st and on wednesday june 2nd and as of thursday june 3rd, when i  finally  logged on.. i was KICKING myself..  Rod.. *sigh* yes lovely lovely Rod left me a message.. updating me on his health. i haven't been lucky enough to talk to him since and i am completely irritated that i wasn't on when he was.. *ARGH!*  if you still read.. i miss you desperately.   my fascination with blond haired blue eyed boys has not waned... but.. you have a big portion of my.. i don't quite know how to put it.. it's not merely my heart.. it's my my.. ech.. it would take days to explain and i'm not quite sure i possess the words.. you are not blond nor blue eyed and certainly not a boy.. you inspire me.. you irritate me.. you make me want to be better..   in other words you do a lot to me..  probably without realizing it.. you mean a lot to me.. probably don't realize that either..

      yes.. i love the cure.. robert smith is my goth king.. i bow to his paleness and black eyeliner..  some fascinations are rather grim.. i realized as i gazed upon his rather lovely face yesterday that... oh my god..   "has anyone ever told you, that you look like James Spader?"  "yes.."  what i really wanted to ask..  "ever get some ass  because  you look like james spader?!"  he looks like james spader.. yes. the actor that LOVES funky sci-fi roles as well as spanking his "secretary"(2002) and being in "the practice". the fascination is over now because.. i understand why it was there in the first place. RIGHT down to the smile and the perfectly straight teeth. don't get me wrong.. i still think he's hot, but.. i don't know.. the allure is no longer there and i feel.. put out.   that and i had a fuckin awesome dream about "the man" last night and that's a dream i plan on chasing to my oblivion.

      i just got back from the dentist.. had 4 fillings.. 2 superficial 2 serious.. i hadn't been for something like 10 years, so i'm pretty lucky i walked away with as little as i did..  i haf da tof off ma mouf nummmmed... *drool*  i cannot smile.. which isn't such a horrible thing, i rarely smile anyway, but the fact that i can't.. pisses me off.  my cheeks feel like they are puffed out and i just KNOW that i resemble a chipmunk in early autumn.  i enjoy making people laugh, even if it is at my own expense..  the dentist shoves this thing.. this monstrous metal thing over one of my upper molars, which i am sure wouldn't even normally fit in my mouth.. it makes for a grotesquely forced grin.   dr lon:  sorry for the pressure..   me:  *snort!*  what  pressure?!   dr lon:  sorry that you cannot feel pressure.  *uncontrollable outburst of laughter*  giant metal structure jutting out of my mouth along with snorts of laughter induce further laughter..   it took about 5 minutes for us both to calm down.

      i think these are quite possibly my favorite types of posts.. i get to express what ever comes into my head.   BLANK!   something all women understand but only a child would wonder about:&nbsp;a woman opens a tampon in a public restroom... (imagine the sound of the plastic&nbsp;wrapper&nbsp;crinkling)&nbsp;a child says.. "ew.. why is she eating candy in the bathroom?!"   i walked into wal-mart last weekend behind a&nbsp;teenage boy&nbsp;carrying a wooden stake.. i DESPERATELY wanted to grab him by the shoulder and introduce myself as mistress veronica and tell him that i'd been watching him for some time.. it was after all.. dusk...   i think of coming back from london on a plane... i phoned my then fiance as soon as i got in.. it was midnight here in Oregon and&nbsp;8am GMT... i had gotten up at 8am the day before to catch the plane home.. phoned 24 hours later (for him).. but i had only been on the plane for 13 hours or so... when i think about it too much, my head hurts.. this is because i am a moron and cannot comprehend time zones... so, did i enter the twilight zone?   yes   i love nachos...

      a person knows when they&nbsp;use a computer WAY too much when they find themselves becoming irritated that&nbsp;they cannot copy, cut and paste in real life...   -i know a person can use a xerox and scissors and that tastey mint paste (i've never eaten it, but i sniffed it alla time in kindergarten (this explains NOTHING, it's non-toxic).. but if YOU are thinking "a person can use a xerox and scissors and paste".. you don't use a computer that much.

        chapter 1: ramblings of a paranoid schizophrenic       we've been thinking about writing a children's book.. we know.. we know..&nbsp;we hear what you're saying.. don't think we don't hear you talking behind&nbsp;our back!&nbsp;we hear you say: Stephen King could write a better more appealing children's book than you.. but just think, think about this for one moment.. doesn't the name Sarah Laughs SOUND like a children's book author? and Sarah Laughs IS something out of a Stephen King book so... see.. SEE!! now it all makes sense, doesn't it? Stephen King writes more than just horror novels.&nbsp;we're so tired of people throwing him in that genre without a second glance. Stephen and us... we're like THIS! we talk on the phone at least.. well, ok,&nbsp;we work with his nephew. there is this other guy we work with.. who has the name of a serial killer. no, shush.. we can't write his name down, he might READ this and what if he is?! he could come after us! we're afraid that he already knows that we know anyway.. help... let us just say that it's not&nbsp;only his name gives us the creeps. every time he sees us, he HAS to say something. we mean, you know, regular people, they see us in the hallway and nod or smile or simply neglect to recognize our existence.. this guy.. this guy ALWAYS has to try to strike up a conversation with us.. he gives&nbsp;us the god damn willies. it's never a normal conversation either, it's a conversation about something psychotic. once he started talking about people who like to watch other people getting hurt. not a sadist, he said.. like a voyeuristic something or other. why the fuck do&nbsp;we care?! ech, if he ever chased us in&nbsp;our car&nbsp;we would piss our pants and want to run him over. but crap, our car is so little it wouldn't do a bit of good. not that running someone down is ever good.        &nbsp;   we know you want to know who this is..      call&nbsp;us on a secure line..      we'll explain everything.       &nbsp;

"shush you silly girl. you know how i feel."    which is nice.. i like to be reassured because i'm an insecure mess sometimes.. ok most of the time.. i just, i never want to be a burden to you. i want you to be happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  you made time to talk with me today even though you had 4 kids at home..   i appreciate it. truly i do. especially after going 2 days without a word.    i missed you.    you know that?    i hope you know that.&nbsp;    &nbsp;

      it's nearly 100 out there.. i am not happy about it. i blister in the sun.   i've got shit to say today. i'm pissed off.. just in general. i do this on occasion. just get pissed off for very good reasons, but not one of them can be pin-pointed.  if you're in the mood to read a good story, assuming you haven't pilfered my archives, check out this relatively recent edition addition? i'm at a loss as to which i should use.&nbsp;entitled  urlLink scars .  recently, i watched a trailer on the net for a movie that will be coming out christmas of this year. it's based on some children's books that i find myself utterly fascinated with.  urlLink A Series of Unfortunate Events : each serial novel has it's own title  urlLink The Bad Beginning ,  urlLink The Reptile Room  and  urlLink The Wide Window  will be covered in the film. it's told that there will be 13 in all.. book 11  urlLink The Grim Grotto  is coming Sept. 21st. so the series is nearly finished.  my bitch.. and yes, i do have one. not that that is surprising... besides the fact that hollywood will more than likely RUIN these stories..&nbsp;is that in the trailer as in many dramatic movie trailers/movies they are using the same DAMN SCORE!!! it's too familiar.. if i researched enough, i could probably list a dozen films it's been used in.. but for my purposes here i will list my suspects. i think it was first used in  urlLink Edward Scissorhands ... then in the  urlLink Harry Potter  movies... i'm sure i heard it somewhere else... NOW THIS! so maybe i'm easily irritated by hollywood and how they recycle.. the problem is, they aren't recycling the proper things, what they are doing is being redundant... redundant... redundant... bastards...  now if you'll excuse me.. i have to go dunk my head in something.

       posted in blinding white resilience  &nbsp;  i'm standing in front of my ex. the one from england.. he's talking to me, i see his lips moving.. but can't quite make out his words. he's standing in the open door of a two tone pick-up truck. only because i know my ex, does this thought seem completely ridiculous.. he's a car person. even more ridiculous, there is a jet-ski in the back. finally his words come to the proper volume.     "i'm going to be up all fucking night Sarah."     *i say something that i've already forgotten*     "you see i have to give myself these injections now..."     he whips out this HUGE syringe with a needle on it that resembles a super long finishing nail. he's wearing nice jeans and one of those puffy down vests, it's navy blue. the needle rips a hole in the vest as he shoves it into the left side of his abdomen. i cannot look away. he finishes up and puts away. smiles at me.        "what has happened to you."           "no time to explain, i'm going now, i want to go shopping at the    urlLink  GAP      tomorrow.. will you go with me?"          "i hate to shop, YOU KNOW THAT!"          "sarah... it was the strangest thing.. there was this girl outside my dorm room, masturbating..."       "shaun... i don't want to hear this..."   &nbsp;      "i found her and said.. hey, there's no need for that, come into my room...."        "SHAUN!!!"   i grab his face&nbsp;with both hands.&nbsp;    "I DON'T WANT TO FUCKING HEAR THIS!!!!"     i tear myself away from him. i end up on the other side of his truck, my head in my hands sobbing.   i've never been more thankful to wake-up...

      random thoughts  &nbsp;  today.. oh dear god.. today.. i feel like a fuckin genius.  &nbsp;  let me explain this. this is not another edition of random thoughts because there isn't anything random about this! yet.. i might plug in some random shit anyway, so there you go.. it could very well be a random mother-fucker. i would excuse my language but there is NO EXCUSE!  &nbsp;  today.. today, i feel like a fuckin genius...  &nbsp;  i feel so lucky that it almost hurts. i feel happy.. no..  i don't FEEL happy..  I AM HAPPY.  &nbsp;  i have this wonderful man in my life.. Rod :) even when i try to talk myself out of believing that you love me.. i can't, because it's right there in my face.  why am i so sure of myself?  i don't know.  i never have been before.  &nbsp;  you're this incredible dish of a man..  you make me think dirty thoughts.  as well as clean ones..  as well as fun ones..  as well as some that have nothing to do with anything other than laughter and giggling shamelessly like a 3 year old.  &nbsp;  i've felt like a million since i've admitted that i love you.  &nbsp;  when i think of you.. my mind wanders to another place in time.  &nbsp;  here are some random thoughts:  &nbsp;  sometimes i still do things that i did when i was 7... sometimes i still walk around with a mirror under my nose, so i can pretend i'm walking on the ceiling.  &nbsp;  i talk to my dog. i ask her how her day was. i call her a lot of names, but not usually the name i initially gave her, "dottie." lolly loo loo.. poo poo dog.. nannynoonoo.. i love my dog.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  it's true.. what my catholic friend heather said "the right person in your life really can make want kids"&nbsp;she forgot to add that maybe they don't want to have kids with you... &nbsp;&nbsp;

      never.. in my 26 years has anyone ever said this:  &nbsp;  "you go ahead and live, get married... but when all of this is settled, i want you to know that i'll be looking you up, i'll track you down and find you. i'll tap your husband on the shoulder and say:  excuse me, you have something i need ... i want you to know that even if i thought i had absolutely no chance of getting you back, i'd still do it."  &nbsp;  i'm still speechless...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      i am reminded...  of what a heterosexual FIEND i am when a particularly attractive man wanders by me with 2 sand bags..  &nbsp; biceps bulging..  &nbsp;  me : "jason, i was just talking about you." &nbsp;  him : "sarah, you're always talking about me."   &nbsp;  your face is turning red... bags a bit hefty for you?  &nbsp;  me : "oh.. of course jason..." &nbsp;  DAMN IT!  and i  KNOW  you're arms are better than his.  &nbsp; i couldn't help but look.  &nbsp;

      this was a strange happening, it's just so.. bare:  Thanks for the e-card. Sorry I haven't replied sooner. I've moved into a new place and I haven't got internet access. I've come back to London for a few days to see friends so can check my mail on my parents computer. How have you been? I've been busy working full time over the summer!!!  Hope you're well Speak soon,  Shaun  Shaun, Well howdee do.. I thought you'd gone off and died.  I've been doing pretty well. I still work out 3x a week and I have gained some muscle tone. I don't think I'm ready to go out and kick anyone's ass anytime soon though.  For some reason, my e-mails to you always come off as being convoluted when I read them back to myself. So I will try to keep it short and sweet.   I stopped taking the anti-depressants a couple months ago and haven't needed them since. I guess it was good enough to use it to get past that huge hump in the road called you. I still think about you and miss you, but it's not such a life stopping force. I know you knew I'd be ok. Thank you for sticking with me for that while and having faith that I  WOULD  be ok. I know I owe more of that to myself because I am a strong woman. I've come to know myself a lot better since we last saw each other. San Francisco in Jan. '04 will always be a bittersweet memory for me, regardless of what it is for you. I guess I wasn't really expecting you to write me back. I don't know if I'm glad you did or not. But it's good to know that you are ok and that you are progressing well in your goals.  -Sarah  i have no idea why i responded. i should have waited a month... i don't mean that, well, i do. it's just.. i don't know.. every time i hear from him, i think of what i've done in the months since i last saw him. how i've stopped NOT LIVING.  i think of that dream, with the ring that fell apart. that's a metaphor for our life together, you see.. we were engaged.. twice. first time, he completely chickened out (date was set, minister was booked) second time.. well, he chickened out again, but he threw the towel in completely. i realized that in all of that, i was never the weak partner. it always fell apart.  i just want him to go away. but i can't tell him.  i won't. but he will.  he's never had a lot of staying power.  that hurt me the most. but it doesn't bother me anymore.

      "i don't always like the shit you write about. but i love how you write it. i don't want to read about how much you like some guy." (i know.. unless it's you)  "you're not normal."   "i want you"  "i need you"  "i care about you"  "i love you"  "i adore you too"  "i like you a lot"  very  important.  "you need recognition for your writing. beyond this medium."  what does it mean when a man talks to his friends about you?  all i can say is... ditto. :) you know it babe.

      i have never really considered how much i enjoy an inside joke.  i had this naughty thought stuck in my head since yesterday.  i had to call him this morning.   i surprised myself. i actually got the words out without snorting with laughter. it was a proud moment.   phone rings...   rc:  hello?   me:  yes, i need to make an appointment.   rc:  oh you do, do you.. (not at all surprised)   me:  yes.. i do.  (shameless giggling ensues)  damn we're sick.. i love it.

      well.. i must have lots to say today, because this is my 3rd post.  true story honest.  it was november 10, 2002 in the middle of the afternoon. my sister rachel had to have an emergency c-section because her labor stopped progressing and her doctor was concerned. hanna grace was brought into the world, we heard her scream once from out in the hall and a hush fell over my side of the family. (because her husbands side of the family are all stupid) we knew something was up. one scream.. that was it, that was all. we found out about 10 minutes later that hanna had a herniated diaphragm and that her liver had not only impeded the growth of her right lung but had now collapsed it. just for fun, her left lung collapsed as well, due to a small hole. i couldn't believe this was happening. my side of the family.. we were numb, very quiet. his side of the family.. stupid.. they took photographs of rachel with a reddened tear chapped face. my sister jenifer told one of them if she saw the camera again she would shove it up someone's ass.  hanna was medivacked to  urlLink legacy emanuel hospital  in portland oregon, where she was put on life support for infants. it's called  urlLink ECMO2 . my mother drove rachel up to portland the very next day. can you imagine? she had a major operation and then spent 2 hours in a car the very next day. she was properly motivated.. she only touched her baby ONCE the day she was born. at this point, we didn't know if hanna was going to live. it was with dire urgency that rachel go to portland.   hanna was on ECMO2 for 9 days before she was strong enough to have corrective surgery on her lungs and herniated diaphragm. i saw her once before her surgery. i couldn't bare to touch her. all of the tubes going into her tiny frail body. i loved her instantly. but it hurt to love her, to think of losing her. i felt only a fraction of the pain my sister was feeling though. i know that's a fact.  i am ashamed of what i did for 2 weeks. i went into a numb state. i was in portland, but i wasn't at the hospital. i was stoned. i was with a man who enjoyed verbally abusing me. no, i'm not a druggy, this is the first and ONLY time i've ever done any kind of drug. i will always feel incredibly guilty for spazzing out on my sister. i pulled my head out of my ass. i got the fuck away from him. i think i would have ended up dead if i didn't.   i went to portland to see my sister, to see hanna grace. the surgery for her diaphragm had been successful. now she had developed  urlLink hydrocephalus . to those of you who do not know what this is. it's bodily fluid that expands between the brain and the skull. it's very dangerous and if not treated very often results in death and in the least a deformed head. hanna had to have another surgery, to have a shunt implanted. one of the very best neurosurgeons in the country works at legacy emanual. her name is Dr. Weby. Dr. Weby is amazing.. i do not possess the words of gratitude i feel for all of the staff at legacy emanuel, let alone for Dr. Weby.  my sister lived at  urlLink ronald mcdonald house  for 6 weeks. she took powerful anti-depressants for most of that time. i have a new found respect for her strength. i love her dearly. the medical bills accrued as the month wore on, i know she felt incredible stress over that as well. the television station that i work for did a story on her. money was raised. bills were payed as well as waived by the hospital itself. an anonymous woman paid for rachel's stay at ronald mcdonald house. she positively demanded anonymity. we like to think that she was there at one point.   legacy is a nice hospital.. we walked through the courtyard garden and a person would have to be a cold bitch not to cry. there are memorial stones and statues everywhere of children that didn't make it and some that did. their stories are everywhere. hanna is one of those stories now.  but this story does have a happy ending. :)  hanna grace turns 2 in 4 months. she's happy, healthy and meaner than cat shit! she's 2! what you want i should do?! *as she holds her hands up in the air and shrugs!* ya'll KNOW how 2 year olds are.  i am in love with dirty brown. she's my buddy. and i know the feeling is mutual every time she runs up to me smacking her lips for a kiss or climbs up my leg for a hug. that kid has been through hell and has been laughing since she was 3 months old and i can't wait to see what a fine person i know she will be.  i will tell her, if she is ever embarrassed of her scars.  "don't be ashamed dirty. those scars are a badge of honor. they are proof of life. they show that you have lived."

      i had a strange dream last night.. maybe in my drug induced state i cannot remember answering the phone, but i SWEAR that it rang.  ok.. i should explain drug induced state Zomig 5mg.  i get migraine headaches on a somewhat regular basis, regular enough to well.. ok.. anyone who has had a migraine knows that once a year is regular enough to possess meds to slay the migraine dragon. that said, i average one every other month. that's 6x a year..  anyway.. the phone rang...   me:  hello?   voice:  hi baby!  conversation ensued that i cannot recall. weird thing is, my phone looked like it had been talked on. that part is hard to explain..   i don't know if it was a dream and now i'm scared..  not really, but it is weird.

      He said I was in my early forties  with a lot of life before me  when a moment came that stopped me on a dime  and I spent most of the next days looking at the x-rays  Talking bout the options  and talking bout sweet time I asked him when it sank in  that this might really be the real end  how's it hit you when you get that kinda news  man what'd you do   and he said I went sky diving  I went Rocky Mountain climbing  I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu  and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter  and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying  and he said someday I hope you get the chance  to live like you were dying.  He said I was finally the husband  that most the time I wasn't  and I became a friend a friend would like to have  and all the sudden going fishin  wasn't such an imposition  and I went three times that year I lost my dad  well I finally read the good book  and I took a good long hard look  at what I'd do if I could do it all again   and then  I went sky diving  I went Rocky Mountain climbing  I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu  and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter  and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying  and he said someday I hope you get the chance  to live like you were dying.  Like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about  what'd you do with it what did you do with it  what did I do with it  what would I do with it?   Sky diving  I went Rocky Mountain climbing  I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu  and then I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter  and I watched an eagle as it was flying  and he said someday I hope you get the chance  to live like you were dying. To live like you were dying  To live like you were dying To live like you were dying  To live like you were dying

      lane transit district (ltd) is a thorn in my side...   and a lot of other sides as well..  i find it completely hysterical that they bought 2 brand new articulated buses a few months back. stating that they were saving us SOOO much money by making these purchases.  last night.. on a trip down I-5 to cottage grove... i saw flashing orange lights.. a bit o' smoke.. and a beautiful new articulated bus on the side of the interstate.. about 20 people had to walk 1/4 mile down the FREEWAY to the exit.. i was actually shocked to see that many people. usually there are only 1 or 2 on board.  thank you LTD... kiss my ass.

      random thoughts.. thought randomly.  i assume the people that are dear to me know that i will always want them around.   i forgive people i love.  the best fantasy/dream i ever heard from a man:  i want to live in a cabin in the woods by a lake with you. we can write all day and make love for inspiration.   this is good on many levels.  -> i'm an outdoorsy, nature lovin' freak. -> i'm anti-social as hell.  -> i love to write. -> i love sex.   the fact that he came up with it says a lot as well.  either...  he is enough like me that he was naming his ultimate yumminess and it happened to be a fantastic match..  or...  he is very intuitive and knows what i would like to hear.  add photography and a darkroom to that and i would be in HEAVEN!

      i’m doing something today that i haven’t done in a long time. i’m sitting at home… writing. i have so much to put in to tomorrow’s post that i thought i would get a head start on it!!! weeeee…  i work out. 3x a week… my personal trainer… well, the guy who wants to be everyone’s personal trainer, but whom i cannot afford, once told me that THIS was the minimum. i didn’t let that make me feel bad… i do that well enough on my own.   i just think…   “congratulations fatty, for getting off your ass and sweating 3x a week.” :)   i won’t let that skinny asshole get me down. he has NO idea what it means to tote around extra weight. anyway, the point of my telling this story is not to rant on about some skinny sexy guy that won’t give me the time of day… the point of telling THIS story is to say that women over the age of 40 love me. it doesn’t matter who they are… how they live… they love the holy crap out of me and they want me to bare their grandchildren. although few will actually come out and say this… i know every single one of them, when they look at me and have a single (particularly shy… overweight… unattractive) son; they want to hook my silly ass up with him. because “i’m such a NICE girl…” if these women knew HALF of my sexual deviances... they would run away screaming.  wednesday, july 7th, 2004 was one such day… it was after water aerobics class… i was sitting in the spa tub… the one i cannot seem to figure out HOW to reach climax in. when one of the women in my class sits down next to me. i didn’t find this too shocking, i mean, it’s a spa tub, it’s pretty inevitable that someone will sit next to me. it made me a bit wary when i noticed that that there were only 3 of us in there and she is seated RIGHT next to me.   i think…  ok, maybe i’ll get hit on, that will make my day, a 51-year-old woman asking me out.  :)   alas… this wasn’t to be.   i must say, the way she went about things…  very very shifty that one…  i probably shouldn’t even be writing about this… i’m going to burn in hell already though, so why the fuck not?!   w:  *babbling on about something*   me:  mhmm… yeah… that’s cool…   w:  *continues*   me:  yes… ( stifling a yawn )   w:  well, after this, i’m going over to $%^& to take some photos.   me:  sweet! i'm a photographer myself, i’ve photographed 4 weddings… only gotten paid for one of them.   w:  OH! that’s wonderful! ( she turns to the other woman in the spa pool and repeats what i said )   me:  ( WTF? is going on ?)   w:  by the way… what’s your name?   me:  sarah ( nice smile, they love the dimples )   w:  oh, i’m very glad to meet you sarah, i’m @#$% and this is my mom @#$%.   me:  ( instantly forgetting both names ) nice to meet you both.   w:  i’m curious...   me:  oh yeah? ( bi-curious? me too ...)   w:  would you be interested in meeting my son?   me:  uh… uh… uh… ( SHIT! i’ve got to say something other than UH !) sure…   w:  great! would you like to come over for dinner saturday night or would you like to exchange phone numbers and make arrangements that way…   me:  uh… (SWEET JESUS LADY!) numbers would be cool…   w:  great! When we get done in here, then we can exchange cards.   me:  OK… ( looking up at clock ) yeah, it’s been 15 minutes, i’m cooked, i need to get out.   w:  yeah, us too.  at this point… i’m dragging my water-logged ass out of the spa pool as fast as i possibly can without beaching myself or gaining a leg cramp. she’s kind of in my way… i manage to step around her and try not to speed walk to the locker room.   she’s a very nice woman and i like her and her mom and her aunt… but i’m not going to the gym to meet people or get dates or anything like that. i go to the gym to make myself feel better. i showered and got dressed. she was waiting for me… we exchanged cards. she said, i should go home and give him a call.   i didn’t, of course.   i don’t want to be rude though and for some stupid reason, i couldn’t lie and say: I HAVE A BOYFRIEND!   ech…

      ok, let me just say that i know that the printer post is there twice and let me also say that i have tried like a mother@#$%er to get rid of one of them, but have not been unable to. i am considering getting rid of that post all together, was a shit anyway.  that said... on to more.. pressing matters. :)  ever catch up with someone? i mean.. someone you haven't had the pleasure of conversing with in a while. you find out that after everything..   you're still fully capable of gushing over one another.   it's almost shameful.   rc:  "when i woke up after surgery, my friends asked, who's sarah?"   me:  "and you said no one..."   rc:  "no, i said.. she's the best writer ever!"  (i'm thinking.. how high on pain meds WAS he?)  a lot was admitted that was probably already known.  at least it felt known..   forever saying thank you..  never believe that i gained as much. i did.  i still am.  sometimes, you're the voice in my head.

      i realized today ( when i went into wal-mart, to use the kodak picture maker and there was a long-fake-fingernailed-teased-hair-havin' 80's-freak-of-a-mom putting together collages of her ugly kids RIGHT there in the store, no prep work involved.. (grimace) WHATSOEVER.. like it's a fuckin' spontanious action to grab all the shit together, cut out shapes and EVERYTHING and THEN go down to the local picture maker and put shit together whilst bogarting the whole fuckin' system for 45 fuckin' minutes.. or however long.. i didn't WAIT.. she didn't even register that i was standing there with my  1  measily 3.5 disk to make  2  simple 4x5 prints.. and the fact that i would (in a similar situation) let her cut.. but then, i wouldn't have started scrap-booking in fuckin' wal-mart either.. ) that i need to purchase a photo printer of my own...

      today was my sister's "4th of July" party on the 3rd, because her and her husband have something better to do than hang out with family tomorrow.. :)   it was fun.. we ended up dancing to "chain of fools" in her living room. this has become a staple in the visit, especially when my 19-month-old niece Hanna "dirty brown" is around. i'm still trying to teach her to shimmy.. she's got the bent knee thing going on and the jive part.. damn she's cute. she's ALMOST got rhythm.  on the outs.. i took some sinus relief to kill a headache that i had, then made the fatal mistake of eating some jell-o shooters and drinking a giant margarita or as jen affectionately refers to them "marges."  i worry about her. she likes to drink.

Thank You! Jill  when she walked up to me to talk about the orders this morning, i grabbed her note and said  "i will rue the day when i can say: "HE'S NOT THE BOSS OF ME!!!"  of course he heard this...  *sheepish grin*  he gave me a hug, he knew i was kidding. i've got such a kick ass boss.

      today... i feel wretched. it's 3 years now since i've been single. this isn't the only reason i feel wretched. let me explain:    the strange happenings of a wretchedly unhappy man, who doesn't know what love is. it all fell apart or whatever. i'm done with it. even if he is not.  have you ever taken pity on someone truly pathetic and felt wretched for it? this added to my wretchedness.  it's been 3 years today and the last i saw him in january, Aug. 7th had no meaning to him. i think he is wretched for forgetting and i think i am wretched for remembering.  enough of how wretched i feel right now, this too will pass. just like a kidney stone.  next week, i will be training, so i don't know how much i will be able to write. i will try in my off time. but i can't make any promises... just say that you've been properly warned.

       my time off  thursday: typical, i slept in until 8.30am and woke up in a panic that i was late for work.. this was not the case. woke the rest of the way up anyway. had planned on taking a trip... a fun trip... it of course fell through. ended up having to babysit dirty brown because my dear mother had arranged her day at an odd angle. bought an air conditioner for my room.  friday: installed said air conditioner... this involved building a little shelf for it and attaching it to the outside of my window.. it was 90* outside.. i was glowing, i had wood splinters down the front of my shirt from using the table saw. got extremely pissed off 2 hours later when i found that said air conditioner didn't FUCKING WORK! took that bastard back and exchanged it. dad offered to set it in my window so i wouldn't be late to my aerobics class. after 2 hours.. i went to pick up my check at work.. since i was going to be in town, i figured why the hell not. i will put it in the bank on saturday... alas... this was NOT to be... someone i work with took the liberty of hiding it. she thinks it's her business to be a busy body. it's a secured building... who's going to take it? and if someone does... it's not like i wouldn't let someone know about it. the check would get cancelled.. a new one would be issued. problem solved. but noooooooooooooooooooooooo... i phoned her at her home and left an irate message.  i went home... began to fall in love. then i went and did something stupid...      saturday:   woke up 9-ish smiled at my beloved air conditioner for providing a cool environment. began to read... i read until noon. took a shower. lounged around until 5pm... ate corn on the cob for dinner. went and bought a book. scared someone. went to bed at midnight.      sunday:   woke up at noon... pondered ways that i could make love to my air conditioner. i must repay it for making me so happy. a candle light dinner and a sensual massage perhaps? wished that i was a computer nerd so that i could block certain IP addresses from accessing my blog. if you will deny me of you... i will deny you of me! all is fair in love and war or love that feels like war.. or whatever! and yet.. i cannot, because i don't know how. went to bed at 11pm, fell RIGHT to sleep because of my lovely lovely air conditioner.      monday:   woke up at 6:30am with a pain in my right kidney.. i'm pretty pissed off because i had to come back to work and i just realized how lame my life is.
