      Good evening. It's day one. I can't say I ever thought I'd do this again, but it's an opportunity and as good a time as any to pour out my feelings. Craig left this morning. We were up rather late on our last night together, after he tucked Mia in and explained that "Daddy's going on a trip tomorrow". The alarm was set for 3 AM and when it went off it seemed like 5 minutes after I drifted off.. fighting it all the way.   He showered, put the rest of his stuff together, and we kissed and hugged and I cried and he left. It was 3:49 AM. I cried for a little while after he left and then I was stuffed up, so I sat up in bed and did the Sunday Times crossword for a while until I felt tired enough to go back to sleep for a while. At 6:30 the alarm went off for me, and I showered and got ready. Mia woke up, as happy as ever, and I got her ready. I left Craig a voice mail; I knew he wasn't taking off until 10:20, so he was still only down the road at Miramar. He called me a few minutes later and I teared up again as I let Mia tell him hello and that she was watching Zooboomafoo or whatever it was.   I took her to daycare, she sang "Good Morning to You" and I know how blessed I am to have her company and her giggle. It's going to get me through this, just like the love of my family, my friends & my husband. It's just hard to think about this seemingly vast amount of time right now on the first night without him. I picked her up, and on the way home, as always, she asked, "Go home and see Daddy now?"   "No, baby. Daddy's on a trip, he's at work, remember?"  "Oh, Daddy go on a trip tomorrow." Yes, Mia. Today IS tomorrow. I'm still reeling at the fact that she's finally remembering the things we talk to her about... but I'm also sure that my little OCD creature of habit will ask if we're going home to see Daddy every time I pick her up for a while now.   He flew to Seattle, called me from there at 1:30 PM PST. He was leaving for BWI in a half hour, and I told him that Mia talked about him, and that I picked up the car from the base at lunchtime. Poor thing has 29 hours of travel ahead of him, that is horrendous. He was going to BWI, then Frankfurt and then Kuwait. From there he's going to Iraq, to his home for the next seven months on a base outside Fallujah. He did promise me he wouldn't try to be a hero. I know that if for no other reason than his love for our daughter, he'll stay safe and come home to us. I know he's an incredible Marine and I respect and admire him so much.  So tonight I tucked my little Pookie in, and she helped me say a prayer for Daddy... and sang him Happy Birthday. Again. I think it might be Craig's birthday for the next few weeks, but that's ok. It makes me laugh. Craig called from BWI at 7:30 PST and told me that the next time I will hear from him is on Monday or Tuesday. At least this time I'll hear from him regularly via email & phone. That will be MUCH better than last year. *Sigh* last year... I can't believe that he had to go there again.   I'll be in here to post from time to time, and I promise it won't always be heartreaking. It's just the first day. I'm sure we have lots of fun ahead of us in the weeks & months to come, it's just a hard day to get through. Each day is one less. I'll be back in here tomorrow night at some point. Good night.

      He called this morning. A helicopter went down earlier this week, and their communications were cut off. Which does make sense... but my imagination runs away from me when i'm worried.   Poor guy.. they're rationing water, which means only using bottled water, which means only using water to drink. Not to shower. In 110-120 degree weather. That is probably one stanky-ass place right now! Hopefully they get more water soon... those poor people on that base, it must be awful. Anyway, he's SUPER busy, which is great as it always makes the time go faster.   He needs new boots, so I bought them today & will mail them out. I have another box going with a bunch of magazines, a couple of articles, and a Costco container of Jelly Bellies (there's a tease for you, baby!... I know Craig reads this).  So in an email today and on the phone too, he said, "No news is good news. If something bad happens, you will find out RIGHT away... so if you hear nothing, everything is fine." I guess that's as comforting as it gets for me right now, huh?  I'm thrilled that it's Friday, especially since I have a nice busy weekend ahead! Tonight Les & Wendi are coming over for opening ceremonies. Tomorrow we have a fun birthday party to attend and then we'll go to Meesh & Bojan's to see their newly remodeled bathrooms (and them, of course). Sunday a ZOO trip with Anne & Ellie (my boss and her 3-year-old daughter, who Mia has already spent some time with...) and then hopefully a nap. then Dana's coming over! It'll fly by, but hopefully Mia will just remain happy & in a good mood (and a LISTENING mood) all weekend.   Ok, time to go home and make this yummy yakitori chicken recipe I found in the Weber cookbook... we'll see how that goes!

      Well, I haven't heard anything from him since Wednesday morning his time, and it's now Friday night his time. At what point do I worry? I'm up at 5:30 today because I keep checking to hear that nice little mail sound and see that it's from him. But instead I get a disappointing "thunk". Nothing.  Logic tells me that if his power was out or Internet was down he couldn't email me... but he's been CALLING. I know they cut off communications when Marines are dying because they don't want that kind of news coming from other people via their communications home. Understandable... but unfortunately Marines have been dying too much lately, and this huge protest in Najaf is only one on a laundry list of battles going on there that is SO frustratingly not covered in the media! ARGH. He's spoiled me, that's the problem... phone calls and/or emails every day, so when this gap happens I worry. It's not like last year when no news was GOOD news during the war.  Anyway, if you get the chance, read the Salon.com article "War? What war?". Email me if you can't get to it, I'll send you a copy... it details the American media's continuing lack of war coverage.  Ok, I need to shower. What I need really is some communication from my husband. Maybe today.

      Just when I've had a few bad days, Monday (of all days) comes and Mia is back in my heart. Of course I don't stop loving her to pieces, but some days are inherently better than others.  FIrst of all, I spoke to Craig this morning. Thankfully this time he paged me after I wasn't at my desk! Well, jeez, it's not like I can call him back! Anyway, he sounds good... ready for the turnover & to settle in to his permanent digs. Right now he has to wait for the guy he's replacing to leave before he can have his space. It's still hot... I felt horrible after I said it was hot here, realizing that was a ridiculous thing to say. (It is, for San Diego standards... but as in many cases, I'm sure he'd trade me) He told me that the "Swiss Steak" they had last night could have been camel..haha. But I got to speak with him for a while, tell him about Mia's weekend more, and ask what he thought of the pictures. He wisely stated, as I'd also previously heard, that often the "threes" are worse than the "twos". Sometimes in the middle of fighting with your 2-year-old you don't look at the bigger picture; EVERYONE deals with this to some extent. Kids can be rotten sometimes, but man does the good far outweigh the bad. And so he told me that he could look at 100 Mia pictures each day and still look at more. Of course, I know that... I can't imagine being so far away from her for so long. Baby, she misses you too... I promise.  Today I went to Costco with the full intention of buying soy milk for Mia and a couple of birthday presents for kids whose parties we will be attending. Then I saw the PUPPETS! They had these adorable glove puppets, there were 4 in each set; one was ocean creatures, one was jungle, one was farm animals and one was zoo animals or something like that. $6.89 a set. Yes, you read correctly. So what's a good Jewish mother to do? I bought the ocean creatures and the jungle animals! I have no will power when it comes to getting stuff for Mia. I also got her the Eric Carle book  The Very Busy Spider ; same dude who did  The Very Hungry Caterpillar . Or, "Caddapidda" in Mia-speak.   So I was very excited to share the book, but figure I'll save the puppets for a desperate moment! So I picked up Mia, and thankfully she had a normal poop today (anyone reading this knows my woes I think, if you care at all and I haven't told you, let me know and I can fill you in), she greeted me with the usual enthusiasm, and Miss Mary said her day was great. I had her snack in the car, she climbed in her seat without hesitation, probably due to the fact that her alphabet book was waiting for her. She tells me what letter all the words start with, and the other way around.   "What starts with 'C', Mommy?" "Tell me, baby." "'Camel on the Ceiling!'"  I think it took her all of a week to memorize that book.. and it's the WHOLE alphabet!  She LOVES books. More than ever. I can't explain how much she loves her books, she brings them in the car, and when I do NOT have her favorite handful of them along, she gets so upset. So, I explained that the  Are You My Mother  book was at home, and I'd read it as SOON as we got there. That seemed to satisfy her. Then we got home, and I made her some chicken while I cleaned for a bit (tomorrow I'm getting the living/dining room steam cleaned and then going out at night, so it should be neat for Meesh who's babysitting), and then while she ate she was looking at books. Surprise. I folded laundry, put some more in, and realized it was 6:40 already. I hadn't showed her the new book! I told her, "Mia, Mommy got you a new BOOK today!" "ooooooooh!!" "Want me to read it to you?" "YEAH! OK... read it to ME?" She ran to where I was standing, and I showed her the book. "What's this on the cover?" "A SPIDERman." "Just a spider, Mia." "A SPIDER!" "Ok, let me get my water, and we'll read the book." "Mommy, I go poopoo, need change diaper." Hm. She already did that today. As I got closer, I realized she was not kidding... "Ok, let's change your diaper, and THEN I'll read the book." She very hesitantly agreed, insisting on bringing two smaller board books with her, two favorites;  Are You My Mother  and  Mr. Brown Can Moo . She was standing by the changing table, and then she handed me the books. I put them on the side of the dresser, picked her up & changed her. Much protest involved due to the sand that came off her previously shod feet and went into her face while I hoisted her legs, poor baby! So I finished to exclamations of,  "OK! Read BOOK! OK!" I sat on the couch, grabbed the "Spiderman" book, and she came to sit - but no, she didn't. She stopped. "OOPS! Be right back," she said. She RAN back to her room, grabbed the two books that I'd left there, came running back with them, put them on the couch next to her, and then sat to listen. SHE WAS LINING UP FUTURE BOOKS TO READ! Not to mention the memory of what had just happened... amazing. Brain development right before my eyes. I laughed and hugged her. She said, "Tiss?" (kiss) and I did. "Hugs?" and i did. And I was SO smart, that when I got to the last book, I said,  "Ok, after THIS one, it's bath time." Small whine. "What happens after this book, Mia?" ".... it's baf-time." RIGHT! awesome, it worked! And sure enough, as soon as it was over, she HAPPIILY marched into the bath! Bath was great, she's finally clean, and I stand her up on the table to put her PJ shirt on. Across the room she spots  Where the Wild Things Are . This is another new favorite, and it's the nice hard-cover version from my brother & his wife that she got for her 1st birthday. I've only recently been courageous enough to let her touch it, she's very good though. "MOMMY! Read THAT book??!?!" I turned around, I'd forgotten I'd even brought it IN there, and she had to crane her neck to see it... wow. "OK." So we walked out, I gave her milk, explaining that I'd read it AFTER milk and tooth-brushing. I said, "One book, just this one, and then bedtime.... what happens after I read this book, Mia?" "Bed time." YESSSSSS!!!!!! And what a fabulous bedtime it was. Amazing day. More tomorrow if I get the time. This novel was for YOU, baby!!

      Sorry, gang (or anyone who's reading this) it HAS been a while!   Let's see... Craig is doing well. The Gunny he's replacing is leaving soon, and then he'll have the place to himself. This includes (and according to Craig, he's "living like a Colonel") his own twin bed, shower & nice big cement walls to decorate! So if you're going to snail mail anything to him, let me know so that you can send something appropriate.  I'm not as sad for right now... but Mia's definitely starting to notice that he's gone. She was a disciplinary nightmare for most of the weekend, and usually the team effort we have going is a huge help. From the moment I fell for him, I always knew Craig & I were meant for each other. But I had no idea what a great parenting team we would be! He is an amazing backup for comforting, discipline, FUN, anything that Mia needs. He is missed in that department for sure.   She occasionally will hit me now, that's not accepted; and I feel AWFUL because I just take her wrist in my hand and sternly say, "NO hitting! Hitting hurts mommy!" and she begins to cry her eyes out. Not the reaction I'm looking for, you know? I mean of course she's going to feel bad when I'm angry, but I want her to feel more apologetic and LEARN from it, not break down in a sad fit of bawling. I guess it's the age. She's still only so-so with sharing too, but that will come. I just need her to LISTEN to me! I feel like a skipping record, "Mia, don't touch. Mia, put that down. Mia, put it down. Mia, come here and do this, put that down. Do you HEAR me? Put it DOWN!" If we're in public, people must think I have a screw loose... I try to make her repeat what I say, but she won't. I just don't understand how someone THAT smart, and with that accute of a sense of hearing (she hears a plane, helicopter, truck, crying baby, anything like Radar from M*A*S*H - before any other human ears hear it) can NOT listen. But yet if it's something she doesn't CARE to hear (mostly things out of MY mouth), she tunes out. Welcome to selective hearing, Mom. This will be in place for at least 16 more years.  Ok, after the bad, the good; I got her a PRECIOUS pair of pink, orange & white flip-flops. (available for viewing at  urlLink The Bowman Web Page ) they're Reef brand, and they were only $7. (I checked.. they're $14 at Nordies! HA!) So I bought them because I could NOT resist, and I wasn't so sure about the size. I left the tags on, and as we arrive at a restaurant to meet Meesh for a happy hour drink after work on Friday, I put one of them up to the bottom of Mia's shoe she was wearing. They were perfect. Mia spotted it as I held it for all of 3 seconds, yanks off her shoe & sock and says, "I want to WEAR!" pointing at the flip-flops!  "You want to wear these now?" "OK!" (If you have MET Mia, you know about her love for "OK!")  So, I helped her take off her other shoe & sock, and cut off the tags on the shoes. I helped her to put them on, she became and instant pro, and I said, "Those are so pretty!" She looked up, mouth in a wide-open smile, and said, "LOOK at my TOES!" I said, "Those are 'flip-flops'."  "FLEEP Flops!" She showed Michelle 40 times, she kept telling the waitress about them, "Look at my FLEEP flops. Look at my TOES!" it was classic. She woke up on Saturday morning and the moment I opened her door she said, "I want to wear FLEEP flops!" So obviously there was a huge breakdown when I wanted her to wear ANY other shoes, but she got over it. The scene is so darn CUTE!  We did have our Sunday morning at Starbucks. She wanted to take 4 books with her, and she's always playing with stuff and pretending it's a backpack, so I had an idea. I got out the backpack we bought for her for school and said, "want to take them in this?" "OK!" I helped her put them in, and she carried them to Starbucks, proud as a peacock. Now she needs to master how to unzip and zip it, but that's another time...   Ok, time to go. I hope you're enjoying the pictures & the stories, everyone. This weekend we have a birthday party & a zoo trip in store! Also a visit with Auntie Dana. Wendi tells me there's a community pool with a water park.. maybe we can find time to hit that soon too.

      It's now Wednesday, it's been almost a week. Even though Mia & I have colds, I'm in much better spirits. I know he's safe, we've talked on the phone a couple of times, and I'm making plans. I spoke with Ayelet the other night, we had a great conversation. Also spoke with my mom who I think worries that I'm depressed; I open my email each day to find an e-card from her wishing me a great day. It's sweet... I'm sure she has no idea what to do.   Just spoke with Lauren for a while tonight, which was great. It's nice to wrap my mind around what's going on in someone else's life, even if only for an hour or so. She's doing well, sounds happy... is one of many of my friends that is doing work on her house at the moment. Construction abounds out here! We made plans to see each other in a couple of weeks. This weekend hopefully I'll spend time with Les & Wendi, Meesh & Bojan, and I'm sure I'll just be making sure that Mia & I are healthy again. The weather is amazing, it's cooled off quite a bit. I've turned off the A/C and opened the windows.  Work is keeping me REALLY busy. It's going well, though; I heard today that we hooked Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe to speak at our Political Action Committee golf tournament fundraiser. That is a nice little coup.   I'm also planning to see Bebel GIlberto (daughter of very famous Joao - see  Girl From Ipanema ) at the Belly Up toward the end of August. A few people from work are leaving after next week so there's a going away party. Hopefully someone can sit for Mia so that I can go.  Mia's doing so great... she seems like she understands somehow. We went to the store today and she sat in the cart (I should specify that it's a cart with a seat for kids, not just the regular cart) and behaved so nicely. She held a box of Spongebob Squarepants mac & cheese the whole time, telling me about the jellyfish & starfish on the box. Others would pass us in the aisles and smile at her and give me the "She is ADORABLE" look. I can't say I disagree. It seems like I'm barely treading water in being able to avoid tantrums or curtail ones that have began, and she's getting smarter and smarter so those tactics are ceasing to be effective. Her memory is improving at an alarming rate, as is her speech ability. It's getting much tougher to fool or outsmart her. I guess it's a learning experience for both of us! The funny thing is, sometimes it works to my advantage, and i don't want to let on... For example, tonight, we got home from Vons and I had a bunch of bags in the trunk. As I struggled since I only wanted to make one trip, she stood looking and started shouting "I want to carry! I want to carry!"  "You want to carry bags with me?" "yeah." GREAT! I handed her a couple of lighter bags, and she brought them inside so happily you'd think I'd let her have candy or something! Keeping that one in mind...hehe.  OK, it's sleep time. I'm fighting this cold and need my rest. Good night.

      Craig called me late this morning, he's there. 130 degrees in Kuwait... I thought with all that flying time, maybe they screwed up and took him to a base on Mars instead. He sounded fine, he was soaking with sweat, and definitely happy the plane part was over. He did say that the Gunny he's replacing has things pretty hooked up out there. I expect we'll all get pictures soon. If you care, the time difference is 11 hours (PST, anyway), so when he called me at 10:15 AM or so, it was 9:15 PM there. So you east coast people can do your own math..hehe.  Had a good day with Mia and of course I regret not having the camera with me. We played on a great playground near Les & Wendi's, and Mia had a ball. I'm pretty sure Jake did too... he called Wendi "mama" for the first time. Well, actually, the second, but the first time you don't really believe it so with babies you wait until it happens again before you get excited. Mia was pretty good, all things considered. She REALLY had fun at the pool. She was previously very apprehensive about being in the pool. In my opinon, she saw Jake's lack of fear and said, "screw this... if he can go in there, I can go in there," and proceeded to jump into my arms from the edge of the pool. Repeatedly. Hm! Guess now I can worry about her around bodies of water... swim lessons next summer for SURE!   I appreciate all of my friends here, your comments, your prayers, positive thoughts.. and WILL take up each and every one of you on your offers! Mia and I WILL travel a bit, I'm buying her a Wiggles sleeping bag that's attached to an air mattress; I'll bet you all that she'll love that thing more than her bed! And I know that now & then even a movie or a dinner out with grown-ups will be very therapeutic. I'm looking forward to it, every bit of it passes time. And I know that Mia is so much better with familiar and fun friends, that's such a huge help to me. (Julie, I mentioned your name in the car yesterday with Stuart, and she fully started talking about you! it was too cute.)   Fabulous conversation with Julie LIttle-Nickson tonight.. she apparently was put in charge of getting a gift for Michael Moore and gave it to him at a cocktail reception at the DNC in Boston last week and he CRIED. She had quite an incredible time with him. Sounds like she enjoyed the convention very much. She & her hubby are headed to the wine regions of France on Saturday, it sounds incredible.   Ok, it's 10:15, start of a new month, a new work week... and one more week closer to my guy returning. Good night, all.

      I was woken up by my daughter stomping on the wall that connects to my room! Talk about a rude awakening. Ah the fun of the "big girl bed".  Lumpy... I'm not a closet  OC  watcher, I'm a FULL-ON out of the closet  OC  watcher! I love that show, and I fully know it's a guilty pleasure. Another few favs:  Six Feet Under  (actually, ANY HBO show, it's just that  Six Feet Under  is on right now),  Big Brother, Amazing Race , and coming up.. the Olympics. That will be a great time-filler! In the fall there will be lots of good new stuff too. I'm a HUGE  CSI  fan, so the New York one is coming and that'll be great. I'm sure there will be more diversions.  Mia's watching Pooh right now at 7:15 AM on a Sunday, and I'm in here wiping the sleep out of my eyes. Yesterday I went to the Carlsbad outlet mall with "Uncle Stu" who Mia had a complete blast with. She really is much easier now that she's friendly with our friends and can stand to be away from me for a short while. However, I didn't bring her stroller so much of the day was spent repeating myself like some kind of idiot.... "Mia, come here.  Mia, come here. Don't touch that. Don't touch that. Don't touch that! I said come HERE!" She usually listens.. there was too much freedom yesterday I think. And Stuart, thank you for being so incredibly patient and amazing with her. For a change, I not only got clothes for Mia, I actually got some pants for myself! Then we did the Jamba Juice thing, and they made Mia her own mini smoothie cup and she sat at the table with us, lifting her glass and saying "CHEERS!" while we clinked cups, just like her father showed her last time we had Jamba Juice. That kid is developing one hell of a memory.  Just remembered... I've also been watching Last Comic Standing for a while, and I had a dream last night that I had to do a routine on stage. I could probably do it, but in the dream I didn't have enough prep time so I chickened out. Strange.  Well, the "boss" calls.. time to make a waffle and get myself ready for a Starbucks trip & the Sunday Times puzzle. I may see Wendi & Jake later, we'll see.
