       Howdy Gents and sick women. Welcome to the nightmare that is    Beer 'N' Porn .  I make no apologies for what you may find here. Suffice it to say, this will be evidence of what happens when a group of your average no-nonsense type guys get together in the name of booze, cheap thrills, and intellectual conversation. This is our take on the world around us. Visit often and stay as long as you like.   Since I started this damn thing, I guess I'll go first. Hang on tight....     I remember being young (younger - 6 or so) and imagining what it’d be like to be 20-something. At that point, I considered 20-something to be fairly old. By then I’d be able to drive, vote, drink, smoke “ I’d have my own home and I’d probably be getting married soon to some beautiful and intelligent woman who loved me right back. I’d be bigger and stronger. I would be a grown up. I thought about it frequently and it made me impatient. I wanted to be old enough to have responsibility but no more “ I didn’t want to be old. Although old age isn’t exactly bearing down on me any time in the near future, it again has become the subject of my daily thoughts. Not in the same way as when I was six years old, however. These thought seem more realistic “ a bit more static and convincing than the six-year-old’s waking dreams. I wonder how it’ll all turn out. Not finally (that does come to mind though) but more in the not too distant future. Who will I be with? Will it be ok by then (with me or with “everyone else)? How will I? Where will I? All this echoing brought me to write this down in an effort to try and clear space in the attic.   I’m gay. Means so much. I find it has a separate meaning for just about every individual. Oh sure some are similar in nature and concept. But somewhere along the line, personal opinion “ the real and deep impressions they make on us and we make on ourselves daily”questions, answers, analysis of what and why”our genuine sentiment”true thought uninterrupted by pressure “ gets added to the mix. From that, a few definitions of gay get splintered into innumerable sub-opinions, sub-sub-opinions and offshoots of sub-opinions and so on and so on. In the end, everyone has there own personal definition and opinion of what gay is. I’d assume it’s like that for just about every topic of thought. But my problem comes from my definition so it’s important that I put it out on the table. Try and bear with me.   What other people think of me being gay:   I’m not a true man. I’m not a complete and masculine man. I am more woman than a straight man. I’m weak and girlish and like girlish things which makes me less of a man.   This hurts. It hurt to constantly battle with all of these (and many other) thoughts of what they are thinking. I checked myself daily for the limp wrist, the slurred speech, the clothes, the voice “everything. I tried everyday to be as masculine as possible lest I slip through the cracks and become one of Them “ the queers, the fags, the “ladies. I tried. I deepened my voice, I watched what I wore and, most importantly, I watched very carefully what I expressed interest in. I didn’t talk about antiques (not really interested in antiques in reality) or interior design (ditto) or the like. Even deeper than this, I more or less kept my distance from and did not express interest in men who fit the gay stereotypes. I tried everyday to be a “regular guy” who just so happens to like men. I tried hard. It was maddening. I couldn’t be a man and like men. My masculinity was eroded by the stereotypical image most people have of gay men “ yes that includes me. I crucified myself in little moments that I caught myself doing the “wrong” things “ right down to the laugh. If I was sitting wrong (fag!) I straightened up or made it a bit more “manly. Is that my hand swishing a little (fucking fagot!) too “sweetly”? Toughen it up a bit somehow. Don’t wear your shirt like that, Drew. You look a like a (fag “ you’re going to hell. You know that don’t you? All of those speeches and pamphlets in your favor are bullshit. You aren’t going to heaven. HE never intended for anyone to stay gay. It’s like a sickness “ a mental disorder “ it’s a demon. God may love you but you can’t be gay. Kill it off, Drew “ Kill it off.) queer.   After a while of fighting that madness, things changed. The part of “Straight-gay guy” was far too tough and, believe it or not, it was literally killing me. I couldn’t keep up with my own standards”and so I just became “Drew”. It all happened very naturally and easily and I found that I didn’t mind me so much then. What I also found was that most of the pressure to be this uber-masculine man came from myself “ a fear breed into me by me and the world around me or being gay. Wow. That shook my thought tree something awful. Took me a while to realize that I played a part in my own slow torture. All this because I believed something. I believed, simply put, that I wouldn’t have friends if I was gay. What a world.   What I think of me being gay   I wish I could be gay without fear. I don’t mean that I’m afraid of getting my ass kicked. I’m STILL afraid of rejection by the people I love and respect. I’m afraid that I’ll be the un-normal kid. I’m even more afraid of my friends staying my friend because of some obligation to be politically correct while feeling outright disgusted at my “unnatural” state.   I wish it didn’t matter. That’s all. Being gay I mean”I wish it didn’t matter but it does. We, as human beings, have not grown to that point. We care. We don’t really care that they’re gay as long as they keep it somewhat lowkey. Don’t kiss in public. Don’t talk about your boyfriend or girlfriend like it’s “ok” and for godsakes, don’t make it sound so “normal”! We don’t want “them” teaching our children. We don’t want them on our buses next to us. We don’t want them singing and dancing or doing (god forbid it) anything in public. We don’t want them to be seen. Sweep those girlish freaks under a carpet somewhere. They’re ok and all but they certainly aren’t (acceptable) normal by any standards. One of “them couldn’t be president “ not seriously. They are an oddity - a novelty. They are the trend of the 90’s and the new millenium. With any luck, our children will grow out of that phase “ that movement. They will soon be returned to the basement”to hide”to practice their abominations in silence, in secret, and away from the rest of us “ far, far, far (die) away.   Forgive the sermon.   Part of me believes the hype. I get a little emotional and I think to myself, ‘It’s because I’m gay’. That’s why this is happening to me “ or that’s why I did what I did. Almost everything I do I associate in one way or another with being gay. I sit this way because I’m (a fag) gay. I do this or that because I’m (queer) gay. I believe sometimes that I’m repressing all of the girlish things that I should be doing. Sometimes I buy into it. It’s very hard for me to be myself at times. I constantly question every move “ every move. Thoughts, words, clothes “ I can’t begin to tell you. Yes, it makes me angry. It makes me angry that I cannot date or express interest without fear. I can’t kiss in public without feeling uneasy. I wish it didn’t matter to us. But it does “ anyone who says differently is likely lying”and that’s not to say everyone is anti-gay. That IS to say that most folk give a shit one way or another.   What I think now    Being gay isn't who I am any more than being a musician is who I am. I am the sum of many things and gay just happens to be one of the ones that a lot of people seems to be riled about. Am I proud to be gay? Getting there. It's a long road and I find I take the bigger steps alone. Yet, I also find out more and more about myself along the way.    What’s my point?   I wanted to give you an idea of what it’s like. In some way I hope by putting myself on the line, a few lights will click on at some point and people will consider a few things that they maybe haven’t before. That’s not to say I want this to change minds “ whether you believe homosexuality is right or wrong is up to you. This is just to remind people of our (my) [their] humanity. That's something we all have in common.     Peace,      Dexter Otis Green

      	 Vituperation and Me     Hello and welcome to the first installment of “ Vituperation and Me ” – a series in which I plan to express my loathing for those who have worked so very hard at proving themselves worthy of my wrath; The “Hollywood elite”, government hacks and quacks, anyone over 60, failed leadership ventures, corporations large and small, the bohemians and, of course, television, will all have a chance to stand before me to be judged. Rest assured that they will all be found guilty of diddling Uncle Dexter in places and ways that would cause most, women and men alike, to spontaneously menstruate.   That’s right! – with that one statement alone, I have struck a blow to the woman’s movement! See how easy it is? You have only to trivialize a feminine quality with a joke or misspoken statement and, booya! You're a chauvinist! Does it matter to me? NO! Women aren’t people! Besides, menstruation is an outdated practice and I, for one, am all for banning it entirely. Let them wear stoppers!   I digress... forgive me.  A search for logic or reason amidst the ranting will do you no good, friend, as I can assure you, here and now, that you will find very little if any in what is written here. I do, however, promise to provide a nightmarish wonderland acid mind rape ride – whisking you away to enlightenment as yet unknown by most.   First up is Gary Busey.    Bio, crime, sentence of: Gary Busey     Bio  Born June 29, 1944 (A product of his father maddening booze escapades and subsequent trips to his daughter’s room for “daddy-touchy-time”) in the bustling metropolis of Goose Creek Texas, it was clear from the onset that Gary Busey was destined for stardom. Busey would begin developing his trademark disheveled appearance and splotchy hectic complexion early on by chugging moonshine with daddy at the tender age of 9 ‘neath a big ol’ Texas sky bristling with heat.    Presumably, it is at this age that he is lost in a drunken sheep-fucking haze that would never completely subside. Rather than working to his detriment, it allowed Busey to see his way clear to breaking into show-biz with The Rubber Band, an obscure rock band in search of… you guessed it, booze and loose women. After meeting The Doors and the Byrds and much sampling of their sweet sweet “schwag-ass” marijuana, The Rubber Band records a predictably sub-par and all together painful concept album titled, “Set a while, Pedophile” with CBS/Epic records.   His foot now in the door, Busey “rocked” his way into several embarrassing television appearances in the early 80’s. His pungent body order and riotous imbibing (coupled with the inevitable drunken belligerence) gave cause for many to hire him in the hopes that he would “just go away”. It was then assumed that Busey was merely a privileged studio hobo who wandered from set to set. Leave it to the likes of Busey to fall short of those expectations.  Fueled by gin and a right shitty personality, Busey shambled his way into several film roles including "Carny" (1980) (Busey as, Vera Stemple - an abusive alcoholic bearded lady), "Barbarosa" (1982), "Silver Bullet" (1985) and "D.C. Cab" (1983). Still unable to get rid of Busey in the Italian sense, films makers created roles that fit Busey’s abusive and unstable personality. Busey was set lose on the street of Los Angles with an 8-ball of coke, 2 hookers, a 1.75 of rum, and a videographor  24 hours before "Lethal Weapon" was filmed in 1987. The footage gleaned from the ordeal was spliced into the film – Busey never once looked at a script.   Busey's film career continued to flourish in the 90's as he starred in such movies as "Predator 2: Gay and Unashamed" (1990), "Point Break" (1991), "Hider in House" (1991), "Under Siege" (1992), "The Firm" (1993), "Warriors" and "Drop Zone" (both 1994) and, the film that made Christ wet, Sidney J. Furie's "The Rage" (1997). Busey also lends his gutter-trashed voice to the best-selling video game,  Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.  Television, film, and super rock stardom were not to be Busey’s only claims to fame. His personal life was to be more than outstanding. After nearly dying of head injuries in a booze fueled “spiritual quest” motorcycle accident in December 1988, Busey feel madly in love and married Julie Amber-Misty Deadham – a 14-year old prostitute turned card shark. Apparently having too much love to give, Busey married and divorced an impressive 21 times. In 1971, one of his “junky bitch” wives gave birth at her prom in a bathroom stall. Unable to “take out the garbage”, she named it “Jake” and another generation of Busey was set to take the stage. Arrested and released on bail after a fight with his 12th wife, Tina “Somethingorother”, Busey would learn to focus on the one true love of his life… whisky. He divorced Tina in June of 1998. Ass play with Jack La Lane had not been ruled out as a mitigating factor in the divorce at that time.    Crime  Birth. That's right kids - I hate him because he was born. If you’re offended by my synopsis then you too, deserve to die. Honestly, if you love Gary Busey and you know it, kill yourself.  ........I’m not kidding.   Gary Busey's entire life is a “French Mistake”. From now on I'll equate the lowest form of things in terms of their relation to Gary Busey and Sponge Bob Square Pants. Spongebob - a fictional character, a non-person - has  a better career, sex life, and coke dealer than Gary Busey witness the approach of the apocalypse......   http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/imwithbusey/   How the fuck did that come to pass?! HOW!??!?  This pretty much speaks for itself. If you need more evidence than this, please don’t hesitate to let me know… I’ll personally come right on over and disembowel your parents. This is clearly a precursor to Gary Coleman’s "triumphant" return to television and I, for one, will not let such an injustice stand.   Sentence  I'm keeping my fingers crossed for heroin and STD's but that may be a vain hope. To be honest, I smell suicide. The man can’t even bottom feed. He’s being followed around by an obsessive college drop out magician…. His end is nigh.    That said, thank God that my job was made easy this time. Burn in hell, Gary Busey. Burn in hell.

       Welcome to the rest of your life  – 6/9/03  It’s nine o’clock on a Friday night. Here I am, firmly planted in front of the TV, watching the Brewers (the Brew Crew, for crissakes) put a hurtin’ on the Red Sox. I have a 12 pack of Harp in the fridge, and five are already taken care of. My plans for tonight – aside from writing this fine piece of opinionated literature for all of you fine lookin’ readers out there – involve watching the game, drinking some more beer, and probably falling asleep. That’s it.  My esteemed colleague Dexter Otis Green believes that, along with others in our common circle of friends, I am succumbing to the perils of adulthood. I no longer take off for uncharted waters without reason or rhyme; instead, I speak of work the next morning, or “obligations” that require my presence in the coming hours, days, weeks, or months. Adulthood is not a function of age or responsibility, I can hear him say – rather, adulthood is deciding that suddenly age and/or responsibilities actually matter.  Part of me agrees with Mr. Green, but another part of me can’t deny that the pressures of a full-time job and the ensuing routine of days, weeks and months do weigh heavily on my poor brain. Which is why I’m here on the couch, wasting away my Friday night on barley water and Jerry Remy’s color commentary. Know why I’m not out causing trouble? Because I’m tired.   I’m 22 years old, and I’m run down.  Friday night is the end of the work week, but it’s also one of only two nights out of seven where I’m allowed to sleep in as late as I want. And of course that’s assuming I don’t have any work due for Monday, or any projects that need my attention, or any other reason why I’d have to go in to work on the weekend. Why waste a perfectly good night staying out all hours when I only get this one rare chance to actually get some  rest ? My one chance to switch off my mind and not have to answer to anyone; no bosses, no co-workers, no payroll department, no bill collectors, no nothing. So alas, it’s the couch and cable for me.  The worst part? In some dismal, dejected way, I enjoy this time off.  So what would drive an otherwise well-adjusted American male in the prime of his life to spend his weekends like a middle-aged divorcee telemarketer? I blame my high school guidance counselors – and, in some small way, my college education.  I see the same thing happening to all of my high school buddies who made it though their undergraduate years. Sure, we all have jobs now, our own places; we live with some measure of independence, however illusory. But when the weekend comes, there we are, sitting at home in front of the tube with a six-pack and a dazed expression as we try to forget the pressures of the 9 to 5. And none of us are older that 24.   At first, I thought it was just the transition from the wild hedonism of college into the drudgery of the cubicle that caused us all to become professional couch potatoes. But then I look at other friends from high school who gave higher education a big ol’ middle finger and got themselves a full-time job as soon as possible. Five years later they’re pulling down good salaries, driving fast cars with their trophy girlfriends to all-night raves and generally not giving a flying fuck about their jobs or their futures. To summarize, they’re living the life of a twentysomething – and I’m preparing for my mid-life crisis.  But therein lies the difference between the legions of college grads sleeping the weekend away and those who’ve always been part of the workforce. As I stated so eloquently before….THEY DON’T GIVE A FLYING FUCK ABOUT THEIR JOBS OR THEIR FUTURES. Never did, in fact. They needed a job, so they got one. They didn’t like living at home, so they moved out. They want to stay out all night, they do. If they forget to pay the rent, they’ll live somewhere else. And if they lose their job, well there’s thousands of other ways to make a living wage, so just find something else.  Back in high school, when my buddies and I were young and impressionable concerning the ways of the world, we were force-fed the upper middle class dogma known as Bettering Yourself Through Education. College wasn’t a choice – it was expected. How else could we expect to get a Decent Job, or the Required Certification, or the Bachelor’s Degree that guaranteed us Upward Mobility? It was simple, really; four years gets you a magical piece of paper that guarantees you six figures at MegaSuperCorp working two hours a week and playing golf in Bermuda on the weekends. Plus your parents pay for it all! Of course we were lining up out the doors to get into the College of Our Choice (or the Safety School, of course, if our SATs or our parents’ tax bracket weren’t up to snuff).  So what has our four years of blood, sweat, tears and debauchery yielded? Sure, we got that magical piece of paper, that Bachelor’s Degree that says the world THIS MAN KNOWS MORE ABOUT CLASSICAL LITERATURE THAN THE AVERAGE PEON. But we never asked the Devil if we could read the fine print. Sure, we’re all specialized ourselves, but we never asked if the jobs would be there. We never asked whether we would actually like the jobs anyway. And we never asked what it would mean to be locked into a single career choice at the ripe old age of 22.  So here we are, a generation of accountants and computer programmers, elementary school teachers and civil engineers, with a ball and chain called our career wrapped tightly around our collective legs. It’s quite a debilitating feeling knowing that if our job sucks, well that’s all she wrote, you better suck it up cause you have $80,000 worth of classes saying this is what you know how to do.  So, as my high school dropout buds jump from job to job and take whatever comes, here I am tied to my desk, doing the job that the Great American Workforce Factory has programmed me to do, forever and ever, Amen.  I lift my sixth bottle of beer to you, my friends. Here’s to the great promise of a bright future. May it someday actually come true for all of us.   -Mr. Carson

      So, here I am.  Finally, I'm ready to add to this mess.  Let me begin by introducing myself.  My name is Jeffrey "---" Motola.  I hope that my nickname doesn't sum it all up.  If that is the case then I don't think that any effort made to be interesting or funny or pertinent will be worthwhile.  We should leave the posting to Dexter, Beau, and Don.  "---" will just stay out of the mix.    Am I bitter about the lack of a nickname?  Yes.  Couldn't I have been Jeffrey "Jeff" Motola.  Is that so hard?  I would even settle for a correct spelling of my name.  Some of you out there may think that this may be a slight overreaction considering the seemingly small offence.  I disagree completely.  This is huge.  I feel neglected.  It seems to me that time was taken to identify the other members of our little community at Beer 'n' Porn.  All I want to know is why me?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  What a little bitch, Huh?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I apologize for everything that has been written thus far.  Lack of sleep has effected me it seems.  I promise to write something at least slightly more pertinent to current events or social morays or something.    Ok, I can't really promise that.  I don't know if I really have anything too pertinent to say.  Let me amend my promise.  I will not whine...maybe.    "---"

       Requiem for a Motivation - 7/23/03    I apologize in advance for this one - it's godawful long, and isn't very uplifting - kinda like Stienbeck. But it had to be said...   Like any great philosophical insight, this one came to me out of the blue, while engrossed in any one of the trivial matters in which I spend my time. For Socrates, it was afternoon discussions and nature walks around Athens; for Aristotle, it was an everyday lecture at the Lyceum. For myself, it was Saturday night bingo at the Knights of Pythias hall in Milbridge, ME.   For those of you from the Great American Midwest, or expansive Asian countries, the Australian outback or anywhere in Canada, Maine might seem small and unimportant. For a child who grew up in Connecticut, however, where two hours’ drive gets you anywhere in the state, Maine is an infinite expanse, a desolate stretch of back roads and unlit streets where the houses are few and far between, separated by twisted and malevolent pine forests that consume the rolling landscape like kudzu. The larger cities, like Portland and Bangor, rear out of the countryside like the manors of feudal lords, commanding the peasantry of the villages to come and work in their factories, their shipyards, their Starbucks franchises. If you are to go north of Portland, you are a farmer; if you are to go downeast of Portland, you fish. Plumbing is a luxury. Hunting is a valid source of daily food intake. It is a pioneer land seemingly out of place in our global economy, and it is the home of my soon-to-be father-in-law.   My lady love’s great-grandmother lives in Milbridge, a town twenty minutes south of Bar Harbor (and no it’s not Bah Hahbah – a true New England accent is much more subtle than a string of idiotic h’s) whose economy is dominated completely by three trades – quilting, crabbing, and tag sale-ing. Her great aunt knits the quilts, and the homestead down the way opens every morning at 9 selling 8 oz tubs of fresh cleaned crabmeat, which combined with a little mayo and a toasted roll (butter, please, thick slabs of milk grease in a one-hundred year old cast iron pan is the way Jesus toasted his rolls, thankyouverymuch) makes the closest us mortals can come to making the Divine Ambrosia of Mount Olympus. Great-Grandma and Great-Great-Aunt live in the same town they grew up in, and keep care of the same houses that served to raise them all those years ago. Great-Grandma is in her late nineties, and doesn’t seem to be much longer for this world, but like any great New Englander she is doing her best to shake her fist at the reaper and stay right where she is. I traveled with her family last weekend to pay a visit to the family, and to perhaps say our last goodbyes to the Matriarch of the family.   The Great-Great-Aunt, along with another Great-Aunt who lives close by (in Maine, seemingly everyone lives until Old Testament-ages – it must be the clean air and the crabmeat) loves to play bingo. It was a Saturday night, and my fiancé and I, having finished making our rounds visiting family, had no plans as to what to do next. They invited us along, and we accepted, although the prospect of a Satuday night in the wilderness playing bingo with a handful of octogenarians seemed like a recipe for drowsiness.  When we reached the Knights of Pythias hall, however, I learned how mistaken I was. We drove for miles on US 1, with nothing but trees and the odd house popping out of the brush every mile or so. The hall, however, was packed to the gills with people. The parking lot was overflowing, and the line for the bingo cards was out the building. Where did all these people come from? I should have figured – it’s a Saturday night in Maine, and it’s bingo night. What else is there to do? Play bingo.  I’d been to Foxwoods before, and they have a bingo hall there. I’ve never been inside, but I’ve stared through the expansive glass doors and seen thousands of retirees in a Great Hall that rivals something from the imagination of Tolkien. Monstrous bingo billboards line each wall, displaying the numbers called and the game being played like batting averages on a ballpark TeleTron. The room, however, is silent, with waitstaff silently passing cups of coffee around to the players intently surveying their cards. It never seemed to me like a place of excitement, of intrigue and suspense; it was a bingo hall, it was slow, it was quiet, it was boring.  Ah, but this was Maine, and it was bingo night. They only come out at night, you know.  Of course, there was a strong contingent of retirees there, but they were by no means the majority. There were plenty of middle-aged couples, thirtysomethings still wearing their work clothes after spending a day plowing fields; single women bearing the quiet fingertip scars of a day spent knitting clothes and bedspreads. A contingent of teenagers were working the concession stand, which didn’t mess around with snacks no sir but served meatloaf dinners on satellite dish-sized plates, tuna sandwiches on monstrous rolls, and slices of lemon meringue pie that rival the greatest works of God himself. These people were not here to “win money” or “pass the time” – this was their social hour, their Saturday night, their celebration of a week’s worth of hard work, and they were spending the time in the company of friends, gossip, and bingo.  A funny thing happened, however, once the games got underway. Without saying a word, the entire crowd fell dead silent the moment the bingo balls fell into the hopper. The bingo cards themselves were made of cheap newsprint, and each player (including myself) had a stack of paper cards fifteen deep, one sheet for each game to be played, six cards per sheet. Not that six was the limit; it was the minimum. Most of the intense players had three or four “games” going at once, which amounted to 24 cards per game, over fifteen games, not counting the final jackpot game which you could buy separately at three cards a game. Two hundred people dead silent at the drop of a hat, ink stampers ready in one hand, feverishly watching the scoreboard at the front of the room. First game was a coverall – get every number to win.   “B7!”  The game was afoot.  Halfway through the fourth game – regular & four corners, $75 prize, second cup of coffee and considering a slice of the lemon meringue – I stopped paying close attention to the game and started watching the crowd’s reaction to each number called. At the beginning of each round, the hall was dead silent, but as more and more numbers were called you could feel a buzz growing in the room. Thoughts became whispers, conversations became more animated, and numbers were chanted softly by many like a mantra. “Come on 27, 27, 27.” After each new number a louder and louder sigh would escape the crowd, as the inevitable conclusion to the game drew closer and more and more players felt they had a shot at the illustrious prize.  And then, BANG, like a house of cards.  “N29”  “BINGO!”  A wave of despair filled the room.  The winner was a woman in her late fifties, a four-gamer with a dizzying array of stampers spread around her like candles at a shrine. An official, still wearing his back brace from his day’s work in the field, read off the numbers on her card to the barker up front to verify that she had won. But no one else was paying attention. From the moment the first syllable left her lips, everyone in the crowd had mindlessly ripped off the last game’s cards from their stack, tossed them aside without a second thought and primed their stampers for the next round.  But wait, I thought! It’s not official until the card is verified! What if she mistakenly labeled an uncalled number? What if there’s still a chance? No matter – mistakes hardly ever happen in bingo, not when there’s nothing to distract you from the all-consuming task of finding the number “35” on a piece of paper and covering it with a blot of red ink. It’s definetly Kindergarten stuff. And no one’s going to fake a BINGO, now are they? Not in front of hundreds of your peers. It’s not worth the cash.  So, without question, without verification, one hundred and ninety nine players trash their games and get ready for the next. And so it goes, from game to game to game. Save for a ten minute smoking break, this is how the next two hours go for the residents of the Knights of Pythias Hall in Milbridge on this Saturday night. Games go for about 10 to 30 minutes, and save for five minutes of suspense before the winning number is called, it’s an endless litany of call-stamp-call-stamp-BINGO-riiiiiip and begin again.   The final game – jackpot coverall – was worth over $400. Not a bad haul for a game that cost $11 to play. Before the winning number was called the room seemed to be vibrating with tension. Prayers were said. Fingers were crossed. Lemon meringue pies were consumed. It was game seven of the world series. Fourth and goal on the 1. A penalty shot in triple overtime. The home stretch. The final lap. This was the moment we were all waiting for, that chance to win it all, to be #1, to take the grand prize.  “BINGO!”  And as soon as she said the word, the hall was empty.  I sat in awed silence. One minute the hall was packed to the gills with people filled with hope and desire and longing and faith. And then it was over. No one sat down to see if the final card was valid. No one even so much as said congratulations to the lucky winner. Nothing. They threw away their cards and filed out of the exits before I so much as stamped my final card.   Gone.  And it was then, as I threw the last of my bingo cards into the trash and finished my last sip of coffee that I was struck with my Profound Philosophical Thought.   Is there any human endeavor as foolish as competition?  We had all played fifteen games, each one with a prize that we all desired. And while the eventual outcome of the game had everything to do with blind, undeserving luck, winning the prize did require beating everyone else in the room to the illustrious bingo. We were all playing for the prize, but we were staying for that possibility, that one in a million chance that the next game would be the one where we would hit big, where the numbers would fall in the right order and we would be the lucky winner.   But there we all were at the end of the day, fifteen winners and one hundred and eighty-five losers; multiple losers, to tell the truth, for we willingly sat through fifteen straight let-downs without concern. And what of the winners? The lucky ones who got the break when they needed it most? So what, I say. They were winners for all of thirty seconds, as their cards were verified and their check was presented. Then it was right back to the next game, where surprise! You’re a loser once again. Enjoy your prize!  Perhaps that’s why the crowd was so quick in discarding their old cards after bingo was called, and I stood by holding on to the vain hope that I might still have a chance. These were battle-scarred veterans of the bingo trenches, and they had lost time and time and time again in hundreds of other bingo halls than this one, and they knew deep down that bingo games are fleeting and the call of “bingo” always spelled defeat for the masses.  Imagine that. One night, fifteen games, fifteen times a loser. How many times had the people in the hall come out and played at this hall? At other halls? More than once a week? Hundreds of losses a month, perhaps thousands a year? How many years had these people, these middle-aged parents and retirees, come to the hall and willingly subjected themselves to the buildup and guaranteed letdown, only to come back again and again like lab rats receiving electric shocks? All for what? For the possibility of winning, if just once?  For the life of me, I cannot think of a single victory that is worth the tremendous amount of loss that success commands as sacrifice.  And what of competition that you can control? Not something as random as a bingo game, or the calling of numbers. What about sport, athletic competition? What about academic competition? Areas where victory can be achieved through hard work and dedication, or so the self-help books would have you believe. What about these seemingly noble pursuits? It may feel differently, but in the end it’s the same as the games of bingo.  All that hard work, practice and perseverance serves only to steady you through the repetitive failures on your path towards winning. Whether you’re a boxer learning the ropes by getting pummeled by contenders during undercard bouts, or a baseball player slumming it in single-A ball as your flat 85 MPH fastball continuously is crushed over the left-center wall, or an Olympic swimmer trying every four years to even make a spot on the national team, it’s all the same. When you’re coming up, it’s all blood sweat and tears.  And what comes of final victory? When you can finally hold that belt, that medal, that trophy high above your head and scream, “I AM THE BEST” at the top of your lungs, what have you accomplished? Your time at the top is fleeting; you are now the single target for everyone else to best, to conquer and to take over. From the moment you win you are now defending your title, and it is only a matter of time before you are dethroned. Someone will be better than you, or you will grow old and lose your abilities, or the game will change and you won’t be able to effectively compete. Victory is fleeting; only defeat is a constant.  And yet here we are, lining up and willingly putting ourselves in the crossfire, playing the game and entering the tournament and buying a slice of the lottery and crossing our fingers and deluding ourselves that it will be anything other than what it always is – in the end, it’s always defeat.  You’d think we’d learn from watching centuries of wars; there is no victor, only dead bodies.  My friends often tell me that I place too much emphasis on silly things, like bingo games and baseball games. Perhaps they’re right. But until I see things differently, I’m going to stay away from the head-to-head for a while. Because, to paraphrase (and turn around) a famous phrase, it is never better to have tried and lost than never to have tried at all. Because, so many times, to try is to lose.  And I’m tired of losing.   -Mr. Carson

      Ladies and Gents!,  Rather than posting another kooky article myself this week, I've decided to give in to the tear jerking whimpers and overwhelmingly adorable puppy brown eyes of the one and only...  Brendan "HappyCutenessBunnyofUnendingPeril" Tormey...   most folk just call him "Dandypants" or "Good ol' Mr. Jones". His unearthly cuteness has moved me to post this article and his cuteness is, in fact, the ONLY reason I actually am posting this article. I haven't read it. I cannot read. He has wooed and wooed and I have bent to his demonic cuteness. Satan himself could note stand against such wonderfully chubby cheeks... such warm and innocent eyes... It's a cuteness that evokes anger... a cuteness that mocks god...  ...   Here goes "Good ol' Mr. Jones"... beware the cuteness...   --Dexter --------------    Imagine, if you will, a relationship. This can be the one that you are currently in, or a fictional one; I’m not picky. So, there you are, with your boyfriend/girlfriend. This begs a question. Are the two of you (insert gender)-friends? Or are you dating? Friends with benefits? Together? Labels, my good people, are one of the first problems you run into in your relationship. The unequivocal insanity that circles labeling a relationship is mind-boggling to most, yet seemingly unavoidable. Because you can’t have two people romantically involved without there being some way to classify it. Even the term “romantically involved” is a label; it infers that there is more to you and another person than just a friendship. We must have a way to tell other people our social status. Otherwise, how would others know whether or not they can approach us? Fear not, readers, for there is a spectrum to romantic labeling, stretching the entire gamut of being (label) more than friends.  The relationship spectrum.   This topic is rarely spoken about; in fact, I believe that I will be the first person to ever put it down in writing. It is one of those life-long lessons learned in the hallways of school, not in the classroom. Right up there with how to fit an entire circus tent in the size of a locker, and how to make really neat hand puppets with sanitary napkins.  The relationship spectrum.    If this spectrum was patented and placed in most public bathroom stalls, I believe that the amount of stress people go through would decrease dramatically. Plus you would probably have a lot less alcoholism and drug dependency. This problem is that severe.  The relationship spectrum.   I fully understand that by doing this, I might completely change the love-sex continuum that we all know and take advantage of. This could be the end of life as we in the 18-24 demographic know it. I apologize in advance, and hope that at some point in the future, my children will find it in their heart to forgive me.   The relationship spectrum.   Note: I have narrowed the spectrum down to five points, which I feel is as low as you can do while still being accurate. Anyone who disputes this, well, can’t do much of anything. Far Left: Singality This is the easiest position to be in. You have no attachments to anyone. You are free to walk the romantic field without any fear of being hamstrung from behind. You are a wild horse grazing on the open plain. You are as free as an eagle soaring over the Grand Canyon. And yes, you are as sexually frustrated as every convict this side of the Mississippi. Put together. This fact completely overrides the other two, and most are beside themselves trying to get out of this position.   Middle Left: FB FB can stand for a few things. “Friends with benefits” is one of the more common ones. So is “Fuck Buddies.”  Regardless of the actual term, this is the next stage in the relationship spectrum; the “lust” stage. There is no real romantic attraction here; this is you and a friend who, when the time permits, take out the sexual frustrations accumulated by your respective singalities on each other like wild tigers. Many of these FB’s get this way spontaneously, where it is “How’s the summer been?” one moment, and “What’s my name?” in the next. There are others, however, who are much more methodical about it. They make sure that there is no mistake that they are FB’s, and FB’s alone. It is only after that has been established that the clothes can fly. These ones have it better than their “sex on the fly” compatriots, for they do not have to deal with the difficult problem that I will call the “next-day talk.”  This is the same conversation the methodical ones had before, but added to the mix is the memory of the past nights debauchery.  It can get rather messy, this “next-day talk,” since many FB’ers find themselves paired off with someone who wants a bit more than that, which doesn’t work at all. If any of you are interested in becoming an FB, I don’t discourage it. I only advise that you are methodically careful of which friend you decide to benefit.   Center: “Dating” I use quotations around this title because this same stage has many other terms. “Seeing each other.” “Romantically involved.” Other times, words are placed before “dating” to further exemplify the stage. “Casual dating” is one of these. So is “Just dating” or its partner in crime “Only dating.”  Regardless of which label one chooses to attach, the stage remains the same. There is no commitment here. That, essentially, is what people are saying when using the “dating” label. Ya, I’m into this one, and we’re dating, but that doesn’t mean I can’t see other people if they just so happen to fall in my lap.  Most relationships start out this way, because unless it is one of those “love at first sight” things, you don’t know whether or not you want to be with this person, so you leave yourself a loophole in case you need an escape. You also find many commitment-phobes in this area. This is a good place to be, if you play your cards right. The problem is that playing your cards right in this stage is harder than Bob Dole on Viagara, so many people get into lots of trouble. Most relationships die in this stage, as the people in it are not ready or willing to continue, seeing the headaches they’re facing so early on. Being in the dating phase brings up lots of questions, such as “seeing other people,” “commitment” and “do we have sex when we’re just dating?”  A lot of times, it is that third question that forces people into the later stages. So we move on.  Middle Right: “Together” I debated using this as a phase, since I think it is one of the lesser-known and used stages in the spectrum. However, I use it for one reason and one reason only. That is because somehow, at some point in the evolution of relationships as we know them, the term together became associated with exclusiveness. If you were to take someone, show them a couple, and say there were together, I’m nearly positive that they would assume that they were only seeing each other. This is the stage where the two participants want to be in the final stage, but are afraid. They could be afraid that as soon as it happens, their partner will magically turn into someone closely resembling the mother from the Goonies. They could also be afraid that as soon as it happens, Mr. More Right than the person you’re with will walk by, see you with Mr. Looks Pretty Bad, and disappear. However, in my own opinion, I believe that most people are afraid that their partner doesn’t feel the same way, so they’ll spend years in this stage, hoping the other makes the first move. It is a good idea if you’re an observer of this, to hit both participants over the head with a rock. It won’t do much for them, but you’ll sure feel better. Occasionally, you might run into someone who is staying in the “together” phase to get the benefits of the final stage, but the supposed freedom of dating. These are more likely than not men, and they’ll end up with their genitals cut off, so we don’t worry about them.   Far Right: Officialness Well, you’ve survived this far. You’ve probably progressed through most of these stages, not necessarily with the person you’re now with, but regardless, you’re here. Time to relax and enjoy the time you have with your significant other. But don’t call them that. Because that might make them think you’re trying to sound like you’re just “together,” and that won’t work. Oh, and if I were you, I’d never slip up and just call them my “friend.” That’s when far right becomes far left real quick. And, don’t call them by name. Because that isn’t sweet enough, and it also might make them think you’re not taking this as seriously as you should be. So, relax with your “exclusively official gender-friend”. That should put you in the clear.  Where am I going with all this? Besides, probably, to the far left where I will remain, blind and with hairy palms for all of eternity? I’m trying to make you see that this labeling business is getting way out of hand. We as a people are putting too much emphasis on what we call our relationships, and not enough on the relationship itself. If we dedicated the time and effort to making our relationship work that we do to what we’re calling it, we would be happier, healthier, and having much more sex. ‘Til next time, this is your “unofficially inclusive friend” signing off.    --Brendan Tormey

       I Don’t Want to be a Statistic    I don’t want to be a statistic.   I fear that someday my individuality will be torn away with no consideration of how I want to be known.  Those who keep me close in the life of the living may forget my idiosyncrasies.  When I am dead all that will be remembered is how I died.  A doctor will mark a red ‘x’ in the required field and put a time and date.  I will cease to be “Don” and become expired meat.  I will be dead.  I don’t want to be a statistic.  I fear a virus will penetrate my being.  It could tear at my soul, rip apart God’s creation, and not allow me to function.  The rest of humanity will stand by, wait for the final moments and record the termination of my life –only to catalog the event among millions of others.  I will be a part of a Venn diagram, or a Hyperbola.  My remains may be sliced and viewed under a microscope.  I will have no choice in the matter, ultimately, because I will be dead.    I don’t want to be a statistic!  I fear I will be shot on the street of Hartford as I travel with my friends to a local dive or pool hall.  I will be in the midst of a routine action and be told when to drop by the speed and caliber of a small projectile.  I will have done nothing to deserve this.  I will have done nothing to “bring it on.”  My death will then become another number in an ad on television discrediting the sale of firearms. But the fact remains…I will be dead.    I don’t want to be a statistic!   I fear I will be killed by my own idiocy.  One day, not too far away, I will be in my yard, going about my business, watching over the kids while I make preparations to repair a couple of shingles on the roof.  I will extend the ladder and it will give the electricity in the wires above the proper path to my heart.  Once again I will be a television star –as another number.  A stupid light bulb with wings will sing and dance telling other people not to be stupid.  I will be dead.    I don’t want to be a statistic.    Heh….  …  I shouldn’t worry so much.    *This ad has been brought to you by the people of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors.  Remember…when life’s got you down, think of death and call us.  1-800-IVA-NADI.    This fake ad was meant to be satirical.  Any resemblance to real life was intentional.  If any of the events seem familiar to you call your local hotline staffed by zit-popping, sexually frustrated, Creek-watching, life-experienced teenagers who get extra credit for “volunteering.”     --D

      The farther back I go in my memory, the less significant and ordered the memories are. When I think about it, I realize that I’ve forgotten MOST of what’s happened over the course of my life and I guess it’s like that for everyone. The minute something is over, we start to forget no matter what it is. Even if we can hold on to most of it, we can’t seem to keep it totally. The more significant an event is to us, the more likely we are to remember it but even those only linger as shadows. Few of those precious moments hang in our heads for long. It’s almost like we’re anxious to get rid of them… or they’re anxious to leave. Memory does that. It evaporates like smoke through our fingers and, eventually, it’s not even memory any more. Yet it still affects us, whatever the happening was, and sometimes that’s what makes forgetting the hardest. We’re left with why’s and no means to seek out the answer.  Maybe that’s why I’m writing – to salvage what’s still there before it blurs behind warped glass.  I think I still remember what’s important, though, and that’s what counts. God forbid I should ever be able to remember everything – every blessed moment of laughter and heartache.   My first memory is of a green bathtub that I had when I was 2 or 3. I know that I thought of it as a boat and that I was bathed in it by my mother who, then, was an angel – the kind without the flaming sword. She sang like an angel as well, and that’s my next earliest memory – my mother singing to the radio. I guess it doesn’t matter what I thought of her singing. She was my mother and when she sang I felt filled up by her voice. When I was a little older, I’d stand outside of the bathroom when she was showering and listen to her sing. I still do that sometimes though I don’t think she knows.  Until recently I would have gladly exchanged that memory for something more dramatic –  a story that was more of an obvious microcosm of my life. Maybe the first time I touched a piano keyboard – I ended up writing a song. My first word or my first tooth, hell, ANY first would have done fine. But I only had this… my mother as an angel and me, going dirty to clean, in my unbreakable plastic boat.  It’s funny how something as mundane as a plastic tub can come to be so significant. It was the first thing in my life that my brain decided to tuck away for safe keeping.  I liked thinking about my mother that way – as an angel. Gigantic feathery wings, brilliantly white robes giving off impossibly bright light, a gently bent smile, warm and infinite eyes, forever warm, never angry, never upset, and always watching. She was like that in my reality at that age. I loved her then more honestly than I have ever loved anyone or anything since. It was beautiful.  	Now years have passed between us, complicating everything we’ve touched and I often wonder how much of that love is still there. 23 years of growing up have put a sizable gap between the boy in the tub and me. Bitter years of fighting, misunderstanding, confusion, and such have put me and mom on opposite ends of the room many times. There seems to be so much to disagree and tussle over these days. Life has a way of doing that sometimes. We’ve faced off on so many issues now that it seems that we can only love each other deep down. And we never talk about it. I can’t honestly remember the last time I told my mother that I loved her.  	Last night, as I was writing this, my mother called for me... yelled for me, really. As always, I immediately got defensive. Making my way upstairs, I decided to tell her about the memory of the tub and her. I told myself that I needed to confirm the story. If the kid in the tub still lives in me, he wonders, while I’m writing this, what had happened to the angel. I thought about all this as I went upstairs. My love for my mother had changed. No longer was it this simple chubby smile out of nowhere. I now have 23 years worth of reasons to love her. Yet there was something about the love that the kid had for that angel. It hurt me that things had gotten to be the way that they were between my mom and I. By no means terrible but 23 years has a way of bleeding the innocence out of any relationship. I’d give anything to be that kid again. She had called me to help with groceries and while I handled them off to the fridge and cabinets, I told her about the memory of the tub. A much simpler version than written here – just that I remembered the tub that was my “boat”.   For a second, I thought I was going to hear “What are you talking about?” if anything at all and I suppose that would have been fine. Instead, she caught me off guard. “You remember that?”, she said and smiled. It was right then that I saw her – the angel – right there in front of me. I let her smile a minute longer before turning on my heels, groceries still in bags, and went back to the basement before my vision blurred and spilled over.   	Somewhere inside me, the kid in the tub still lives. I’m pretty sure of that now.   Dexter Otis Green

       A Treatise on Divine Intervention – 8/27/03   Much of this little corner of cyberspace has been dominated lately by discussions concerning the existence of a Divine Creator; whether He really exists, what is His plan for his creation, whether He is really a She, and all sorts of fun bits of trivia St. Augustine probably bored his dinner guests with. In the spirit of academic collaboration, I hereby throw my hat into the ring. And, since September is “Early Modern Western Theological Philosophy Month” in the state of South Dakota, I’ll begin by forming my argument from first principles.  To begin, a caveat.  I am an atheist.  This statement is going to affect my arguments concerning the topic at hand. First and foremost is my lack of faith in the presence of a God/many Gods/all-encompassing Spirit/etc. I do not disdain faith, however. This is a common misconception among the God-fearing population at large concerning the atheist. I feel faith is one of the most essential human qualities, and allows people to strive for greatness when their path is unclear. As the apostles had faith in Jesus the Savior, so did Galileo have faith in a sun-centered solar system, as did Newton have faith in gravity and Pasteur have faith in the germ theory of spontaneous generation (translation: bugs make ya sick). The common thread of all faith is a trust in the existence of that which cannot be proven. Some have faith in God, I have faith in the evolution of life from a puddle of goo. Try to prove either.  Now I ask the religious in the audience to stick around until the end. Yes, I am an atheist, but I’m not here to argue against the existence of God. My esteemed colleague Dexter Otis Green already did quite a number on the Almighty a couple of weeks previously and it would be foolish of me to try to follow in his footsteps. Instead, I’m going to start from the same basis as our esteemed European thinkers did three or four hundred years ago.   Let’s assume, just for fun, that there is a God.   A number of postulates follow from this assumption. First, if there is a God, He (sorry girls, but it’s easier to keep with tradition than writing She or He/She or S/He or It or The Great Hermaphroditic Force in the Sky – my apologies) must play some sort of role in existence as we know it. Regardless of whether He is a part of reality, or outside reality, or however you want to conceive of Him, His handprint must be a part of our perceived universe simply because He exists, is all-powerful and played some sort of role in the creation of all this muckety-muck.   Secondly, if He does exist, and does play a role in existence, then we can assume that He can directly affect the goings-on in reality. This follows from the assumption that God is all-powerful. We can elevate this statement as a postulate simply because if God wasn’t all-powerful, he wouldn’t be God and therefore would be a great big cipher in existence. Therefore, all sorts of biblical craziness becomes plausible, from creation to the words of the prophets to burning bushes to plagues to the commandments.  This isn’t to say it happened exactly to the letter of the Good Book, but it allows for such things to occur.  So, let’s recap our first principles, a la Descartes:  1)	There is a God 2)	He is all-powerful 3)	He must play a role in existence, either through existing within it’s boundaries or by affecting things within the boundaries of existence 4)	THEREFORE: God must be able to interact with existence 5)	THEREFORE: God must be able to interact with us  Simple enough, right? Conclusion #5 follows from our connection with reality. Now, however, comes the tricky part. If God can interact with us, and God does interact with us, then God must have a motive for interacting with us. This leads to another interesting conclusion:  1)	God must be able to interact with us 2)	God can affect changes in existence through his interactions with us 3)	THEREFORE: God must have a motivation for his interactions with us 4)	THEREFORE: God must desire to make changes in existence  This is extremely important. For God to interfere in the daily activities of mere mortals, he must have a motivation to act. If he has a motivation, he has a desire. And if God has desires, then God must have actions that support his desires and that detract from his desires. Such is the basis for sin – actions by mortals that act in counter to the desires of God.   AHA! But how could mere mortals hope to understand the mind of the infinite? How can we determine what is and what is not part of God’s plan? It’s not possible - unless God himself gives us a clue about what and what not to do. And as we stated before, God is perfectly capable of interacting with us when and how He pleases. And now we reach a critical juncture in our understanding of the Big Cheese:  1)	God has desires for His creation 2)	Creation cannot deduce the mind of God (because the finite mind cannot comprehend the infinite) 3)	THEREFORE: For creation to understand the desires of God, He must allow his desires to be known 4)	THEREFORE: God must expose his desires to Creation through His interactions with it.  Now we’re able to bring in the Bible, the Koran, the Torah and Talmud, the words of the prophets, the burning bushes, the dead sea scrolls and anything else documenting the interactions of God with his creation. One can still argue that the true desires of God can be diluted or distorted by those who document His works, but this does not affect the original motivation or the actual occurrence. God works in mysterious ways, which means humanity more often than not will probably miss the point, but that doesn’t stop God from trying.  Now that we’ve defined our God, we should be able to conceive of how we choose to interact with Him. And here, finally, is my theory concerning God.  If there is a God, we should spend less time worshipping him and more time preparing for him.  It’s clear from the classic works of western monotheism that God takes care of His people. When he chose Abraham and Sarah as the first of his great people, he gave to them the land of Israel, and watched over their development as the first great civilization to know God. When they strayed from his teachings, he allowed the Godless Egyptians to enslave them and destroy the great temple at Jerusalem. However, He did not condemn His people; when they had learned their lesson, he sent a great prophet to lead them out of bondage and back to their promised land. He sent them a code of laws to live by so that they may live according to His will. These great laws were written in stone and placed in the Ark of the Covenant, which the descendants of the slaves used to conquer the Godless tribes that inhabited the Promised Land in the Israelites’ absence. The Old Testament tells of Joshua marching the Ark around the fortified city of Jericho, causing the walls to collapse out of the sheer power of God’s will. When again the Israelites lost their way, he sent His only son to live among the people, to learn of the plight of mortality and to share the glory of the Kingdom of Heaven with God’s creation. He then allowed all of civilization to know of his glory, through the works of the apostles and the teachings of the great prophet Mohammad. God, it can be said, takes care of his peeps.  But look at the world that we live in today. Our great God-fearing country is beset on all sides by the tyranny of evil men, to borrow a phrase. People working in the Almighty’s name murdered thousands of Americans in the attacks on the Twin Towers. The great Christian countries of the Western world are under attack by the Eastern Islamic peoples who see Westernization as the mark of the Great Satan. The holy land itself is a war zone, where children are torn apart by suicide bombers in the shadow of the once great and holy Temple in Jerusalem. The great countries of Pakistan and India are close to a nuclear holocaust, spurred by land disputes but fueled by differences in religion. Belfast has been in tatters for centuries because of differences in Christian denominations, not even divides in religions. Much of the conflict in the world today is either directly caused or indirectly motivated by differences in religions that have at their core a faith in God.  So how do we view God’s divine plan in the light of recent events? Are we, the Great Western World, the harbingers of peace and justice? Is God on our side as we force our own brand of peace through free trade on the proud peoples of the Middle East? Or are we actually playing the role of the Egyptians, enslaving God’s people with our sinful ways and our Western ideals which are counter to His will? What gives us the preconception that God might actually be on our side? Don’t forget our previous postulate: we cannot know the mind of God, for the finite mind cannot understand the infinite.  So who knows where we stand? What we do know is that, for whatever reason, God feels no desire to step in at the present time and heal the pain and sorrow of millions. He felt no desire to stop the suicide bombings in Gaza; no desire to stop the state-sponsored killings in many an Islamic fundamentalist state; no desire to divert the planes from their intended targets two Septembers ago. So we must ask ourselves: what is God trying to tell His creation with his inaction?  Perhaps it is time to stop acting in God’s name, and time to start preparing for the coming of God’s wrath. For I guarantee that many a faithful person died in the Trade Center attacks, and I wonder why God failed to save their lives that day - much as God fails to save the lives of those killed by U.S. bombs worldwide.  Who dares to understand the mind of such a vengeful God?  -Mr. Carson

      Well, it’s that time again. Time for me to delve into the deep reaches of my mind, and put my thoughts down on paper. Today’s topic will follow along with my colleague’s topic, and we’ll touch on religion. More specifically, this is just a list of questions that I have for the higher power. Now, before I go into the meat and potatoes of this writing, let me first set the stage in terms of my own beliefs and feelings on religion. I consider myself a spiritual person, but not a religious person. What this means is that I don’t subscribe to any particular group or religious affiliation. I don’t feel like I need to go anywhere or otherwise do anything special to be closer to a being which I feel I am constant communication with. I’ve read a little about a variety of religions, and I find pieces of each one that I like, but I’ve yet to find one I am willing to completely throw myself into. However, I was raised Catholic, so that is where a lot of my basis in religion is. Therefore, I will be referring to a majority of things in the Catholic sense (i.e. God, Jesus, Father Copafeel.)  Well, I believe that covers it. Now, as I said before, this is just a list of questions I have for the higher power that I believe exists.   --Why, if you truly exist like I believe you do, is there any question about your existence? Wouldn’t you want your creation to know of your presence? I’m all for the modesty aspect, but don’t you think life would be a lot easier if you made yourself known? I mean, the whole evolution vs. creation debate would be settled, and then those people could do something more worthwhile with their time, like find a cure for cancer, or paint my house, or something more meaningful than bickering over a topic that could be easily settled by just one hand writing “I’m here, you fools” on the wall.  --Everything happens for a reason, right? Even trite things like fashion? If so, what was the purpose of parachute pants? Poodle skirts? The bee-hive hairdo? Hm…Maybe it’s your way of telling us that we shouldn’t be taking life so seriously. I mean, honestly, do you honestly expect anyone to be able to look at those bubble pants people wear these days and not laugh? This must be proof that you have a sense of humor.  --What is with the fanaticism of organized religion? More specifically, why are there so many different ones? You know which one is right, so why do you allow other people to practice “false” religions? If they were all one and the same, just different names, Id understand, but there are differences abound. Or is that the point? Are we supposed to realize how silly we are being, and therefore, try to come to a consensus. If so, Id take another look at humans, because we are eons away from that ability. We can’t agree on what we want on our pizza, and that’s with people of our own color and culture. Come on, omniscient one, give us our due.   --Love handles…Why?  --Finally, Is there a perfect person for everyone out there? A Mr/Ms. Right? Someone who can know everything about you from just a seconds glance, and yet still spend hours on end listening to you ramble on and on without ever once looking bored or lost? Someone who understands and accepts every single one of your quirks, no matter how strange they might be? Someone who fits into that emptiness that can lie inside your heart, and by fitting into that space, make you whole? Why aren’t we born with these people? Wouldn’t that make life easier?  If youre out there, and would like to answer any of these questions, just let me know. Ill be waiting.    --Brendan Tormey

      WHO ARE WE? (PT.  2)   What makes you believe that you are special?  There are many possible answers to this question.  Our sense of self worth stems from the many different people, events, and circumstances in our lives.  Since our last commentator focused exclusively on self worth as related to God my retort will as well.  What then are our options in trying to decide whether or not there is a God.    1. There is no God 2. There is a God, but he does not care 3. There is a God, but he does not have control (and maybe never did) 4. There is a God, and He is all powerful   THERE IS NO GOD  Enough space has been allotted to this option.     THERE IS A GOD, BUT HE DOES NOT CARE  This option, it seems, is believed by many.  I do not think that people want to believe it.  I do, though, think that deep down many people do.  There are certainly valid arguments for this type of God.  To many God is distant and cold, cutting down people in their prime, giving to the rich and taking from the poor.  God starves the poor and feeds the rich.    My hope is that our God is not this God.     THERE IS A GOD, BUT HE DOES NOT HAVE CONTROL  What if God did create all?  What if He at the very least set things in motion?  And, what if after he set these things in motion He lost control?  Is this the God that we have?  What does the evidence point to?  The state of our world could certainly be viewed in a way that would lead us to this conclusion.  Our world, as viewed by some at least, is getting worse and worse.  Traditional values and morals are in decline.  The world community is in turmoil over a great number of issues.  All over the world things are getting worse and worse.    Is this our God?  I hope not.   THERE IS A GOD, AND HE IS ALL POWERFUL  What if God did create all?  What if He set things in motion and has remained in control all this time?  There are many people of many different faiths that would say without hesitation that this is the type of God that we have.  What evidence do we have to support this though?  We have the personal testimony of millions of people throughout the ages.  Also, the many who have gladly been willing to die for their God.  There are the stories of miracles, healings, visions, etc.  The majority of the world will tell you of the all-powerful God that we have.  Is this enough though?   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I don not have concrete evidence to prove the existence of God.  No one does.  Faith is just that, faith.  It is a very personal thing.  People see God in many different ways.  Stories from a person�s life may be touching and may convince some of the existence of God, but there is no concrete evidence to be had.  So, it seems that I have not truly countered my fellow bloggers last post.  That, however, was not my intent.  My intent is simply to say that there are many different viewpoints in this world.  Those who do believe in some kind of God are not necessarily acting simply on blind faith.  Having faith, or not, does not mean you are stupid or ignorant.  Many people have spent their lifetimes searching for God.  Are those searches meaningless?  I think not.  �---�

       Who are we?    What makes you believe that you're special? That you are the product of divine execution? That you are gifted or otherwise noble in any way? That you are anything more than a cosmic mistake? What makes you think you are worthy of anything at all? That you are a sacred being? That you are important? That you matter in the least with regards to the course of anything?   I'll bet the majority of you reading this quickly shouted, "God!" or "The Bible tells me so!" (or one or more of the lies that you've been chewing on since childhood) in response to my opening barrage of questions. If I thought that was funny, I would laugh and likely respond with something evil concerning babies or the Jews. It's depressing, though, that such an answer is the first that most of you come to when searching for the answer to the question of your worth or importance. You have been lied to and I'm sorry that I had to be the one to have told you. You'll not believe me, I'm sure. When shaking yourself free of the cookie cutter, you were sure to maintain form. God is real - “ mommy and daddy say so. God is the reason for all things good and Satan the reason for all things bad.   ...  I'll do you the favor of telling you now that God has nothing to do with it.   You've have been made to believe a lie... and I don't blame you. It's an attractive bullshit story.    I want you to take a look around you when next you open your eyes. The divine can be found in anything (good and evil) if you look long enough. I've heard that God is in everything and everyone or, to a lesser extent, God created all that is. It is no wonder then that he should be reflected in all things. What?!  Lies.    God created nothing.  You created God.   I defy any of you readers to prove otherwise. The first person to do so may have a week's worth of my pay or $1,000 - whichever is of greater value. Bring me your blind faith, your ancient texts, your mother's wisdom, your miracle tales - bring me the lot of your ambiguous "evidence"?. I'll listen kindly to your D&D myth and then I'll tell you who is truly responsible for it all.   Me.   That's right.   Dexter did it... or, to put it another way...  Dexter is God.   Can you prove otherwise? Can you honestly say that you have a shred of evidence against such a claim? No. You cannot. It is impossible to have any such evidence and I'll tell you why.   Firstly, God is an ambiguous concept. What or who is God? What's God's purpose? There's a question whose answer will never be agree upon.    God is Jesus. God is an elephant. God is a chubby Asian who can dance the watusi. God is a castrated hippie in Kentucky.    If an agreement can't be reached on who or what God is then how is it that you could tell me who or what God isn't. I could just disagree! Nothing can be proven or disproven as truth.  Secondly, any evidence you have against me being God must be faith based. There is no evidence for God nor God himself cannot be defined. The only thing that will stand up to faith in an argument is stronger faith, different faith, and facts. Faith, by itself, is no proof at all.   I win.   Faith takes the place of rational consideration. It's the un-think potion - and that's not always a bad thing. I have faith that beer will get me drunk, faith that chicks will constantly hit on me and buy me things - both against my will - (it's the honest truth), and I have faith that republicans and democrats will eventually fade away. Pretty harmless I'd say. Your faith however in God, however, encourages discrimination and emotional self-mutilation. The magic about your faith is that it is self-healing, self-regenerating, self-sustaining, and, best of all, it's free, right? Just check your soul and wallet at the door!   Allow me to clear a few things up if I may....   Your God has done nothing  and will continue to do so for all eternity. He will keep you in fear of swearing and loving cheating on your taxes. He will force you into temples and mosks and churches. He will bore you with his sermons, jade you with his lying clergy, depress you daily by affirming through his bible that you are not now, nor will you ever be, good enough. He will gleefully pluck the dollars from your pockets so that he may line the pockets of his most dedicated and charismatic peddlers. He will terrorize you with his demons, his devils, his imps, and his Lake of Fire, and, most of all, He will not answer your prayers when you really need him to - ever. He will demand that you obsess over him constantly. He will beat you and tell you that he loves you. He wants your soul and nothing else...  He loves you.   He has given us all an innate desire for LIFE (sex, drugs, food, love in all it's forms) and all that it offers and yet he demands that you deny yourself the very things you crave. He wants you to be in need so that you'll seek him. He wants you distracted by pomp and ceremony lest you open your eyes and live a little. He doesn't want you asking questions. He wants you as a shield.. .he needs YOU to defend him with your imperfect knowledge because... well he's only God - he gets pretty busy and, besides, he can't do much in his old age. He doesn't want you thinking outside of the box - ever. He wants you to recycle the same tired rhetoric that was feed to you so that you can feed it to your children if you haven't done so already. Everything you think is wrong. Everything thing you love is evil. Everything you want is poison.... Unless it has to do with him, that is.   In exchange, you get "direction"? and a [false] sense of self-worth based on someone or something (or neither) that loves you.   Suckers.   God is proof that we're worth it. God is proof that we aren't an accident. God is . God gives us hope for the future. God makes me feel good because I know we aren't alone. When I'm alone and afraid or whenever I need HIM, I can get down on my knees, close my eyes, and smoke the throbbing meat-pipe of Christ and everything will be ok if I just believe forever and ever and ever amen. Right? Right?   God is a reason to choke off damn near every instinct so that you may be closer to his divine such-'n'-such. God is a reason to be afraid. That's right. God is the reason you're angry with homosexuals. God is the reason that you feel alone. God is the reason you're angry with yourself. Understand something. No matter what you say or do, you will never be good enough for him. He'll beat you and love you and beat you and love you and [Tithes and offering! - I'm the most powerful being of all time but I can't get enough of your money!!] he'll plant his holy sausage in your face as long as you let him.   Call me a God-basher if you'd like - That is certainly your prerogative. Shield yourself with your rhetoric. Vomit up your propaganda, rename it and re-chew it all you like. It all boils down to the same thing...   You believe in ______ .   Your God that encourages genocide and love at the same time. Read Genesis through Deuteronomy. A God that'll lie about love will lie about anything. If he IS real, he certainly isn't consistent, reliable, or trustworthy.   In other words, even if your sadist of a God is real, he's likely lying when he says that you're special.   Don't get me wrong - I'm not encouraging anyone to be an atheist at all. I'm simply encouraging you to consider the possibility that you may be deluded. Go on and tell me I'm wrong.   You'll say to me, "Well Drew, can you prove he DOESN'T exist?" Hmmm. Well, ma'am or sir, I could make up something as wacky (but never as effective, I'll give you that) as God and say it's real. Then I could easily write a book about it and get a bunch of people to believe in it. At that point, how would you feel if I challenged you to prove that MY God didn't exist? You're the one that made the outrageous claim that God is real - the burden of proof is on you. The only claim I'm making is that what I've been told about God is bullshit.  If you're counting on HIM to make you feel special or to prove that you're worth it, you're wasting your time. He simply doesn't exist.   I'll get to those of you who don't believe in God and still think you're special in a later segment. I've spent the better part of 2.5 hours trying to be as polite as I can. It's 3:30am and I am tired. I will say this...  If you can not live with the fact that you may not be special... that you may just be some cosmic burp then you will most certainly find a reason to disprove or at least blind yourself to the possibility of such a notion.    God is what happens when we stop believing in ourselves.    Once you accept the fact that you are what you are for better or worse, no magic Daddyman in the sky is necessary. If you can't accept that, at least take comfort in knowing that Jesus and Santa both love you very much. If it came down to a matter of choice, however, I'd pick Santa. I'm pretty sure that he delivers.   You have been judged.

      Quest for a name: A documentary...  We find our hero high atop Mt. Kilimanjaro, where he is searching out the great wildebeest. Wait, that's Jim Fowler.   We find our hero deep in the Adriatic, where he is searching out the great tiger shark.  Wait, that's Jacques Cousteau.  We find our hero sitting around his room, where he is searching out a matching pair of socks. Yep, that's me.  It has come to my attention that in order to be a true full-fledged member of this elite association, I need a nickname. You know, that thing to go between the quotes. I suppose its so that I dont need to type my whole name when I write something, or so that the critics of my articles have another way that they can hurl insults at me. Either way, I was told I need one, so venture with me now as I set out to find myself a nickname. And I have decided that in order to accomplish this lofty goal, I will discuss with you now the reason that I have found myself in this place; and that is fate.  I have probably mentioned this more than once before, but its one of the core truths of my existence, so Ill say it again; I am a fatalist. This is the closest thing I have to an organized religion. I believe that everything happens for a reason, from the choices we make in love and money to how many tater tots we take at breakfast. Every single action that takes place in the world is meant to happen. This may seem, to some, to be a fairly radical stance on the topic. Most would say that they have a moderate belief in fate, but that they also have some free will to serve as a counterbalance. I think free will is a marvelous idea, but I dont buy it. If you look at some of the atrocities of human existence, both tragic (Pol Pot's massacre in Cambodia) and trivial (Bubble Gum music), you can't honestly tell me that these people made the free decision to do what they did. It was decided for them, and they are simply reacting to the conditions given them. Others might say that my stance on fatalism is so radical, I should be simply sitting around and doing nothing, waiting for something to happen. I suppose that could be the case, if I were not aware of my beliefs. However, since I know where I stand, I can live my life without fear, knowing that my every action was planned out beforehand. Thus, when I decide on the word that will go between my quotes, I will be 100% content with it, knowing that nothing else would work.    Which brings me, faithful reader, to my name. I sat a spell, and thought about fate, and where it has taken me so far in my travels on this Earth. I thought of my early days growing up in the south of England. I thought of the day my life completely changed, and my parents and I moved to America. I thought of my high school days. I thought of college, and of my life to come. And I realized something...Noone can pronounce my last name. Of course, this realization had nothing to do, really, with my contemplations, but it was shocking, nonetheless. My last name isnt really that hard to get. Its only 6 letters, and it doesnt seem really foreign or anything. I blame it on "The Golden Fog", Mr. Mel Torme. See, he pronounces his name "Tor-May", and being that he is the most famous (or only) person with a name even closesly resembling mine, I feel he is responsible for this problem I have encountered.    My name is pronounced "Tor-Me", as in   he tore me off a piece of paper      So, Im a future teacher with, apparently, a hard to pronounce last name. This will not do. I can't have kids spending hours trying to pronounce my name; it will hinder the learning process. Luckily, a friend fixed this problem for me. "Just call yourself Mr. T. Theyll be able to pronounce that." Mr. T...Hm...Still enables me to be formal with my students, but is easy for them to pronounce. It also hints at a touch of bad-assness, for I pity the fool who wants to mess with Mr. T!  So, this is it. Fate has brought me to this moment, where I no longer am Brendan Tormey, the unpronouncable wonder, but I am Brendan "Mr T" Tormey, the unpronouncable wonder who will throw you through a window if you mess with him. (Watch the A-Team, fool!)  Brendan "Mr. T" Tormey

      The clothes we wear…It sounds like a really bad informational video you’d have to watch if you got a job at T.J. Maxx or something. In my last article, I touched on fashion, and how silly some of the things we as humans have worn over the course of our existence. This time, the first decade of the 21st century (I don’t know what we’re calling it), is no exception. What follows is a list of different fashion/personal appearance trends or other issues that I have problems with. If I touch on a certain style that you cater to, please don’t take offense. Contrarily, please contact me and enlighten me on the rationale behind it. Although some of these will be fairly hard to defend. Here they go, in no particular order.   -Capri Pants. These confuse me. Are they pants, or are they shorts? People who wear them look like they are wearing pants that are too small, and are too lazy to buy new ones. Someone told me that it’s for when its too hot for pants, but too cold for shorts…So the 3 ¼ inches of leg that shows in Capri pants makes all the difference? I have a hard time seeing that. Going along with this are those people who have actual pants, but feel the need to roll their pant legs up into Capri’s. What is this morbid fascination with the lower half of calves? Weird people.  -It’s apparent that a lot of people have much too much time on their hands. I can tell this by seeing the amount of effort that people are putting into their everyday appearance. I can understand the occasional social event that you doll yourself up for, but the college students who act like every day of class is their senior prom really confuse me. For example, I had an 8 AM today, and I saw a lot of girls with styled hair and make-up, wearing an outfit in which everything matched. That means that they probably got up at 6 to spend 90 minutes getting ready, for a 75 minute class. I think there should be a law stating that people can not take more time getting ready for something than the actual event lasts. Think of the scientific advances that could be made with this time.   -Belts. These are a simple concept. A piece of material for the purpose of keeping pants up. Somewhere along the line, people decided that belts could be so much more, and now they’re just silly. For example, the belts that don’t serve their purpose. I’ve seen some that are like waistlaces (necklaces for the waist, for those laymen out there). Belts are for holding pants up. If its not going to do that, don’t wear one! Also, there are people who go the opposite route. I’m referring to those people who have belts larger than most weight belts you see in the World’s Strongest Man competition. Unless your pants happen to weigh a metric ton, you don’t need industrial strength leather. Please, people, think of the cows.   -I like necklaces, don’t get me wrong. I think it’s perfectly fine to wear a chain, I’ve done it myself. However, there is a limit to how many you can wear without looking ridiculous. That limit is one. Why do you possibly need more than one? I’ve yet to meet a person who has ever said, “Oh, look. That guy/girl has the U.S. Mint on his/her neck. Let’s get it on!” Unless you need to show off your supposed affluence through the amount of bling bling you got, in which case, you have other problems not covered in this diatribe, stick to one necklace per customer.   -I don’t consider myself a very scientific man, but in the research I have done on the topic, I have discovered that it is almost physically impossible to have hair on top of your head that is one color, and facial hair that is another. Which brings up a valid question. Why do people do it? To me, these poor souls just look confused. “I don’t know what I’m doing, my hair is two different colors, I can’t decide, I’m lost.” Pick a color, and stick with it.  -Now, I don’t think this applies to everyone, but I just need to ask the fine readers a question. Would you ever wear a button-down dress shirt with windpants? Ralph Lauren on top, Adidas down below. Does this make sense to anyone? What kind of job interview would you be going to? Along with this is another question. Dress shirt, dress pants, flip flops. Huh? No sense at all does this make to me. Please, good people, enlighten me.   -Artificial tanning. I don’t get it. It’s not like we live in Alaska, and the sun randomly disappears for weeks at a time. That, I could understand. But, the sun is there, my friends. I can see it. Why do you need to pay to do something that would happen if you just went outside? I’m tan, but that’s because my summer was spent half-naked…Working as a lifeguard. Get your minds out of the gutters, sickos!  -Now, guys, don’t get mad at me for this next topic. I’m criticizing, but I’m not complaining. Actually, this applies to both genders. Paint on clothes. Muscle shirts, incrediblytightpantsthatlookliketheyhadtooilthemselvesuptosqueezeintothem, things like that. I have an idea for these people. If you’re that intent on leaving nothing to the imagination, just walk around naked. I’m sure the people youre trying to impress wouldn’t mind in the least.   -They call blue jeans blue jeans for a reason. And this reason is because they are blue. They are not blue with random white fade marks, or brown ones, or anything like that. So stop wearing pants like that! Did I sleep through some announcement which said that looking like you sat in bleach (or worse, if you wear the brown ones) was incredibly sexy. It makes you look like you don’t change your clothes often.   -This one hits close to home, since one of my close friends seems to be the flag-bearer for this style, but it confuses me, and damn it, I will not let my own personal feelings get in the way of providing inanity to you, the readers! Wearing two t-shirts. For example, a white one under one with actual graphics or something. I guess it looks decent, but a t-shirt is supposed to be worn underneath a polo/dress shirt, not another t-shirt. Read the rulebook, guys.   -Speaking of T-shirts, how many people see a girl walking around with an “angel” shirt on, and actually think that they are an angel? Most of the people walking around with shirts like this are, I hope, trying to make a point in being oppositional, since when you see a supposed “angel” riding someone at a party, they don’t really look like God’s messengers.   -This isn’t a criticism, just more of an open question. Have you ever seen a natural blond with a good goatee? Or any kind of facial hair? I haven’t.   -Suit jacket, with T-Shirt underneath. Hm, are we harking back to the days of Don Johnson and Miami Vice? If so, do us all a favor. Move to Miami.  -Has anyone seen the sandals that aren’t really sandals? They’re just a pair of shoes with small holes, so you can see approximately 1/64 of their foot, but that’s it? What’s the point? Either wear full shoes or sandals. You don’t need to ruin a pair of good shoes by slicing one quarter inch hole, and pretending it’s the latest trend. Once again, think of the cows.  -If you have a Bulls jersey, don’t wear it with a Celtics hat. And don’t wear Cowboys and Panthers stuff at the same time. This makes you look confused, and bi-partisan, and then you’ll have people from both teams looking to kill you. To prove this point in detail, I actually saw someone wearing a Red Sox T-shirt with a Yankees hat. This guy, in Connecticut, is just looking for a lynching.   -People who wear big baggy T-shirts over short shorts, so you can’t see the shorts underneath. This goes back to the paint-on clothes. Just don’t wear shorts. No one could tell the difference anyway.   I think, my friends, this tells us a key point about human culture. Our priorities are all screwed up. We need to go all futuristic, with the matching silver outfits, so we could devote our time to more important things, like what’s on TV. Oh, and maybe we’d find time to learn how to talk to each other too. But I doubt it.     --Brendan Tormey

       A Christmas Wish    ...(wiping)  ...(patting tummy)   And thus ends another successful Thanksgiving with my clan. I hope all went well for you and yours. This year, after a number of rough spots with my family, turkey day really put things into perspective. Despite all the madness that passes between us, we're still a family. And isn't that what it's all about? Indeed.   Thank sweet sweet Christ white folk butchered, raped, robbed, enslaved, and infected the indigenous peoples of the Americas. God forbid this day should have passed without me gorging myself on fruits torn from the fertile womb of mother earth.  ...there there... you didn't think I'd let an entry pass without a touch of cynicism now did you? :)  Thanksgiving is a holiday I can get behind. At its core, it's about family and togetherness. It's about remembering what's important; our family, our friends, our health, and our amazing fortune being afforded things like television, and electricity, and running water, and freedom. What with Bush's tedious war, our sag bottom economy, and the other ever lingering effects of September 11, things were certainly put into perspective for many of us this year. I, for one, am glad that someone chose turkey as the backdrop for all of this holiday introspection as I simply cannot think on an empty stomach much less count my blessings one by one. We have a hell of a lot to be thankful for.  Unfortunately on the heels of my favorite holiday comes the biggest lie I have ever been sold.  Friggin' Christmas.  The day after the magic of Thanksgiving, we go out in our empty cars and with empty hearts we collectively head out with one purpose in mind.  Presents.  Before I go any further, let me make something abundantly clear.  I HATE CHRISTMAS ... a lot. In fact, I can think of little else that I hate more than Christmas. Now before you go hollering "Scrooge!" and other empty Christmas-borne jargon, let me explain. Keep in mind, I'm not trying to convince you that you should also hate Christmas. This is just a blog and, as such, this is just one man's opinion. What's more, I don't really have words enough to express how I truly feel about Christmas. Indeed, such is my impassioned loathing for Christmas that I can barely organize my thoughts when the topic arises.  At the very mention of anything "holly-jolly", my blood boils and my brow crumples. My toes curl and my eyes darken. I feel sick to my stomach. I want absolutely nothing to do with it. Why?  Christmas is pretty much Thanksgiving II. And, as rare an occurrence as it is, in this case the sequel is better than the original because it comes with presents. Presents   and   turkey!! How can you top that, right? But wait! There's more! There are ciders and candy canes and discounts on all of your favorite big company's wares. There's holly and eggnog and lights and Santas in every mall. There's bonuses from your jobby-job There's roast this and baked that and jellied such-n-such with whipped topping. There's caroling and cards and worchester sauce. And, speaking of caroling, there are about one million of the happiest most splendiferous wonderful joyous yuletide songs that you could ever hope for and they are sung over and over and over - played on every radio station and oozing out of the mouths of every good and righteous citizen like so much golden honey. And all of this wonderment is glazed with universal love and warmth for our fellow man. Not to mention that it's Jesus's birthday. WOW! All that AND Christ? - Fuck thanksgiving, right? Bring on Christmas!  In reality, however, Christmas is a lot simpler. In fact, I daresay I can sum the whole shebang up in one word:    Presents . That's really what it's all about. That's all any of you tree-decorating happy ho-ho-ho'ing sonsofbitches really care about. Presents. Admit it.   No? Oh no wait it's not about presents? Damn it, you know you're right. I forgot about the one thing that makes Christmas so grand and awesome and totally badass. The Christmas Spirit, right? Man, what a dumbass I am for not remembering the good ol' Christmas Spirit. What a loser I am! The Christmas Spirit!! That's what makes it easier for us to deny a man some change - hell we know he's gonna buy drugs with it, right? Plus that means less money for presents! God forbid we should go out of our way even a little to help someone. I mean, Christ! - It's CHRISTmas! That good ol' Christmas Spirit reminds us to write out a long and impossible list as well. It reminds us to talk about love and consideration of those less fortunate but only for a little while and we don't have to mean it. And who has the time what with all the shopping and empty yuletide posturing we have to suffer through. But it's worth it, though. I mean, hell, even Christmas needs a cover. It can't just be about presents... that would just be plain shallow. The Christmas Spirit reminds us that without presents, there is no Christmas. Period. Damn... That sexy ass Christmas Spirit is pretty sweet. Good thing I remembered, huh? Must've been the Christmas Spirit that reminded me. Good ol' fine ass sexy ass Christmas Spirit.  Listen, I'm gonna level with you and let you in on a little secret. You like Christmas because you can afford it. Don't go on with this "I barely have" and "we don't have" and whatnot. You eat everyday multiple times a day. You have a warm place to sleep and clothes to wear. You can shower whenever you like. You have money to spend on Christmas. A small percentage of you fine readers know what it's like to be truly broke - to have absolutely no money whatsoever. The rest of you will just have a few less golden burritos and platinum big macs and your Christmas will turn out fine. My point? Glad you asked - If you truly couldn't afford Christmas, you'd feel differently about it. I'm not saying you'd hate it. I am saying, however, that it'd be much less about presents (if at all) and a lot more about... well what thanksgiving is about in some ways. Thanksgiving is about remembering how goddamn lucky we are. How grateful we should be that we have people that love us and that we have anything at all. What's that? Oh you buy it but you don't believe that it's all about presents, eh? Presents are just a little part of it and, were they gone, it wouldn't matter, right? You'd be like a bunch of goddamn Who's around the tree of your love holding hands and swaying back and forth in time singing a merry ol' Christmas Coolio remix, right? Ahh... I see. Then say, no thank you. Tell your family, you'd rather not have any presents this year. That their warmth and affection is enough. Hell, tell them to donate the $ they were going to spend on presents to a worthy cause. Just once... just one year. Because presents don't really matter, right?  I'll tell you this. Not one of you will do it. Not a single one. And I don't really have to say why... but I will. Because Christmas IS about presents and that is all. Period. End of story. You can tell me it's about baby what's-his-nuts all you like but if they suddenly disappeared from view, you'd be fine so long as you got the game cube or that leather jacket or that hardcore japanese porn. Go on and tell me it's about good will toward men.... then tell me what you've done if anything at all. Tell me it's about love and family and togetherness and you might have me there for a min. But I know of a similar holiday that  doesn't  have corporate sponsorship. It's called Thanksgiving.  Without your precious presents, your Christmas is just another cold December morning. Go on and keep lying to yourselves if you want. I've said my piece. You want to know what my wish is?  Keep your dirty little Christmas to yourself.   Bah Humbug,  Dexter

      ok ok - it's been a while. Me and the fellas took some time off to clean the pipes and recharge the batteries but we're on our way back... I promise. As of late, I've been somewhat motivated to write an article on love. It's damn near immpossible to fully get a handle on something that complex but, after considering my angle, I think I've just about got it down. For now, however, let my cheesy poetry surround your mind. We're coming back - you have my word.      In a puddle is where I saw my constitution on a brisk walk from here to greatness  I looked up and saw how far down  I had yet to travel and I had her to thank for the walking shoes  She lives there in my neighborhood watching me with my awkward tie my silly blue jeans and stupid grin and she loves from there on the broken bench paint flaking off fleck by fleck as winds pulled her dress mercilessly taut against her shadowed frame  her wet eyes carasses my side and old feelings rise within her/me tethered and seperate from this scandel living in my nightmare neighborhood  what to think now of my constitution... fair warning had been issued yet I couldn't help but pause to reflect on her hard gentle purpose of loving me intensly forever and forever  I looked up and saw how far down  I had yet to travel and I had her to thank for the walking shoes   ------    --Dexter Otis Green

       New Year's Triple Post! ***********   So here it is... year's end. Fantastic, eh? Another one in the bank. I, for one, am always excited at this time of year because it signals an all out booze fest... and I do so enjoy my booze. Before I get to drinking, though, here's the end of 2003 as seen by 3 relatively sober 20 somethings. Take it like a man and read on.    --------------------------   Damn Right... it was better than yours...   My year was most certainly better than yours. Why?  I got more ass than Wilt Chamberlain. Period. That was my goal and… well… I did it. So there.   Nah nah nah nah nah  Fuck the magical year end revelation. Fuck the bitchy review.    I got more laid times than you did.  Which means I’m better than you.   Say all you want about me… when push came to shove, I was on the giving end.   So suck down your double strength captain 'n' cokes and smile your empty smiles. Raise your dirty little glass of dreams and shout the countdown to another year of nothing. Because until you can outsex me, you'll always be a loser...  ::hiccup::  ::bourbon::  ::stumble::  -- Dexter Otis Green  -----------------------  It is surprising to note that in the original draft of the United States Constitution, our fledgling Democracy was in many ways far different than the system we live under today. Of course, back then only white male landowners had an unalienable right to vote – but the differences run deeper than this.  In the original Constitution, including the first ten amendments (the Bill of Rights), provisions were in place for the election of a House of Representatives, a Senate, and a set of Executive Officers (President and Vice President). However, of these three, the people (white males, in this case) were only allowed to directly elect members of the House. The Electoral College is a vague concept to us nowadays, and during most Presidential election years the College is referred to simply as “votes,” since an entire state’s number of electoral votes goes to the winner of the popular election in that state. This system, however, is only due to state statues that force the Electoral College representatives from each state to cast their votes in accordance to the popular vote.  As things originally stood, the public would vote for Electoral College members, who themselves would then meet and cast their own votes to determine the Presidency.  A similar system was in place for the Senate, where each individual State legislature was responsible for casting the votes for the U.S. Senators. The voting system for the U.S. Senate stayed in place until 1913, when the 17th Amendment passed the voting power to the general public. And as we all know from the FUBAR’d Presidential election a few years back, no amount of state statues will change the fact that our President is still chosen by an Electorate.  So why bring all of this history up? Especially on the eve of another New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with the seemingly eternal Dick Clark (who at this point must be drinking the blood of babies to keep his face wrinkle-free)? Because I was sitting at my desk trying to think of amusing anecdotes to add to a possible “Year That Was!” retrospective for Beer N’ Porn, and I realized that there really wasn’t anything of interest to report.  Nothing’s changed.  Hell, when I mean nothing, I mean nothing. Our economy is still in the tubes. We’re still at war in Afghanistan. There’s still hostile combat taking place in Iraq. We still don’t have Osama bin Laden. The government is still excelling at taking away the rights of its citizens. The executive branch is still corrupt. The Office of Homeland Security continues to be the biggest waste of resources in the history of the United States, and that’s saying something considering we’re the country responsible for the SUV and the old Styrofoam McDonald’s containers (remember those?) Our FBI is charged with protecting domestic air traffic, yet can’t even subdue a hysterical soccer mom. Don’t believe me?  urlLink Read the story yourself . The CIA, once able to tear down entire governments with a single well-placed rumor and a few well-aimed bullets, now can’t even keep the names of their lower-level operatives secret. Again, urlLink  read the story yourself .   Hell, even the counter-resistance hasn’t changed. Social unrest comes in waves, and just like the ocean, each one looks the same. You could take the denim-clad, black hair, black-rimmed eyeglass wearin’ hipster emo liberal eco-friendly protester from today and swap him out with a long hair psychedelic flower-wavin’ LSD-dropping hippie from the late 60’s and they’d be saying the same damn clichéd catch phrases. Forty years pass between our old Vietnam and our new one, enough time for a generation or two to pop out and learn how to walk and talk, and still each side stays the same. The government’s still busted, the people are still stupid, the protestors say the same damn things, and nothing ever changes.  When I was growing up, there was an old run-down factory on my side of town that had a long red brick wall that was always a ripe target for graffiti. For the longest time while I was growing up, there was a large anarchy “A” written in white paint with the words “IMPEACH BUSH!” written nearby. When I made it to high school, the words were crossed out and in their place someone wrote “IMPEACH CLINTON!” Ten years later, and almost written right over the old letters, “IMPEACH BUSH!” blares out again in Krylon glory. Apparently, Bob Dylan got it wrong. The times, in fact, are not a’changin’. They’re staying the same.  People clamor for the President to be removed from office. People in California clamor for their governor to be removed, and lo and behold, they were successful. Here in my home state of Connecticut, we’ve already removed two mayors for corruption, and we’re working up steam to get rid of our Governor for trading government contracts for a new hot tub. The Nintendo generation apparently can’t even wait for each election year to violently overturn the government. It’s becoming standard operating procedure to vote someone in to office, then complain about ‘em and kick their sorry butts out.  Our Democracy works like the Gong Show used to be.  As I sit here, thirteen hours before the New Year, I leave you all with my own conclusion about the year that was. Perhaps the Founding Fathers had it right. If there’s one thing that we’ve all learned in the past year, it’s that people are tremendously, colossally stupid. Not individuals, mind you. Individuals can be smart, resourceful, caring and kind. But when individuals get together, they become people, or crowds, or political parties, or religions – and at that point, there’s no limit to how amazingly stupid they can be. Democracy, while the government of choice in my book, seems to have the unnatural ability to not only allow stupidity to foster, but to allow it to grow and become strong until it is a blight on the survival of the society. Perhaps it’s not such a good idea that our fellow men (and women) should have such a say in who runs the show. Next time you’re in Wal-Mart or KFC, take a look around you – those people are the ones running this country. Scary, huh?  So, I have a message for the people of the world on this night.  Deal with your own fuckin’ stupidity.  Deal with the fact that you voted for an imbecile for Governor/President/Senator, etc.  Deal with the fact that the problems of the world are your fault. Deal with the fact that your belief system is responsible for the suffering of others.  Deal with the fact that you are probably part of a greater association of extremely stupid people making extremely stupid decisions about phenomenally petty things.  If I had my way, I would make elections public. Each individual should have to go on record with whom they voted for. Then that way, when their elected official passes laws or executive orders, the people who voted for that person can be affected first.  Let’s see how fast the people wise up to their decisions when they’re the first ones to empty their wallets to pay for money lost to corruption, the first to give up their rights to the will of the majority, or the first to pick up a M-16 and fight in some Godforsaken desert three thousand miles from home.  Happy New Year, sheep.  - Mr. Carson   --------------------------------------------------------  Hey everyone, back for another scorching?  Nah Just kidding, this time it’s nothing but my two cents on the whole New Year’s thing.  So 2003 is ending, lots of things have happened (Wow, that sounds like I took it right out of George W Bush’s mouth didn’t it?), some good, some bad.   The following went good this year: •	I turned 21.   This has to be the best part about this year. I mean, I am selfish sometimes so this has to rank on high.  Plus the kick-ass celebration my friends threw for me was great. Hey anytime a guy gets jumped by three hot chicks has to be a good time! •	Return of the King.  Good god, what we had been waiting years to see finally culminated on December 17th.  My sleep cycle has been fucked up since then, and it’s worth it. I’ve seen it twice so far, which is scant few compared to some of my friends.   All I have to say is Pelennor Fields… good god. •	Apartment. 	There is nothing more liberating than agreeing with your parents that it is time to move out of the house.  Unsettling as all hell is what it really is.  I spent the first three months in this apartment by myself, cause my roommates had other commitments during the summer. I know Santa cried because the son was moving out of the North Pole to stake his own claim on the world.  But I must say, living by adult rules when you’re 20 puts a few things into perspective, like the need to save money, and other stuff kids don’t think about. Fucking teenagers… •	I discovered Pool.	I had always enjoyed playing a game of pool when I was a kid, whether is was after a league round of bowling or wherever I saw a table, but the pool bug didn’t really bite me until about September this year.  I started becoming a voracious student, trying my best to learn how to play this game.  I have books, my parents supported me by getting me my own cues, and if I know that there’s pool on ESPN, it’s almost impossible to pull me away, especially the Trick Shot competitions.  And if you’re going to laugh because I’ve chosen billiards as a serious hobby, just remember, I could be doing crack on the side of the road instead. •	SpikeTV.	About fucking time.  This is the best idea for the TV since… well the TV.  I can’t talk enough about the praises of this station.  It’s got Bond Movies, American Gladiators, Slamball, and there’s usually something blowing up on the station, all of which are awesome.  Real Men of Genius, we Salute you, Mr. SpikeTV inventor. •	We went to war.	Now before you get out the crucifixes, hold up.  As terrible as war is, sometimes it does have a boon on the economy.  Come on, we wouldn’t have gotten out of the Great Depression as quickly as we did if it were not for Trigger Happy Germany and Kamikaze Japan.  We go to war, we have to make lots of stuff which in turn creates lots of jobs, while our men are going out to war, and our women stepped up in a big way in WW2 and helped the war effort by leaving the kitchen and going to work.  Money starts flowing in a big way in our nation and thus our economy starts booming again. Think of it this way, we went to war and our economy started improving. Now do I think killing everyone we see just because they don’t agree with us is a good thing? No way, but it did some good.  And, just because I got your attention, here’s a list of the things that went bad. •	We went to war.	Now I know what you’re thinking right now.  Didn’t I just say that us going to war was a good thing?  Well, yes. I’m also saying it’s one of the bad things that happened this year.  War is never cool, unless it’s in a computer, and even computers are getting to the graphical point of mimicking entry and exit wounds in bullets, explosion effects from bombs and whatnot. (I think when it hits that point it’s going to be insane) Now, I understand our motivations: Dubya is just finishing the job that his daddy didn’t do.  Has anyone even heard of Osama Bin Laden lately?  Come on people, don’t be that stupid.  I’m going to get off my soapbox on this in a minute, but let me say this:  The wool is over our eyes.  We took our shitty domestic squabbling and political positioning and hid it all away while Bush went off on his wars, fueled by the words “terrorist” and “Weapons of Mass Destruction.”  Now that we’ve even gone so far as to capture that bastard, have we found any, and I mean ANY Weapons of Mass Destruction?  No, of course not.  Pull back the veil from your eyes and see what exists.  Through political manipulation of intelligence, we went to war, and killed many, many people.  And after “Mission accomplished” we’ve lost more Americans than in the actual war.  Someone I knew from High School is dead from this conflict.  Do I pity him? No. It was his choice, and he knew the risks.  Do I wish he was around? Of course, I’m not that heartless.  Just open your eyes; War is the best double-edged sword in existence. •	The Matrix Sequels.  Wachowski Brothers, What the fuck were you doing? First movie, awesome.  Second one, Train wreck.  Third One, Flashy, but didn’t have a lot of soul in it.  Ok, let’s break it down on The Matrix Reloaded.  Very cool premise, lots of pretty special effects, but unfortunately special effects alone don’t make a good movie, you needed a lot more development.  Still enjoyed watching it, but didn’t get out of it what I thought I would.  Score:  C+.   The Matrix Revolutions, the answer to all the riddles, right?  WRONG!  That movie created more questions than answers.  Plus with all of the inferred plot from the shitty shitty dialogue the movie boiled down into a Special FX bonanza.  Also enjoyed watching it, but I was looking for more meat in the dialogues. Maybe I was looking for a message, and maybe the clowns really are not scary.  Score: C. Biggest issue, once you tell someone that they are the next JC, and JC can do all kinds of freaky cool stuff, then the movie turns into a version of Superman. •	Reality TV.	It’s time to cut the bullshit on this stuff.  Survivor has gone on long enough.  Who cares anymore? It was novel when it was first thought up, and just like the Real World, it has turned into a seething cesspool totally losing the original concept.  (Nothing’s better than the original, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and both Matrix sequels proved that)  Fear Factor?  Was a good idea. I enjoyed watching people do things that I couldn’t bear to do myself.  Time for these shows to go the way of the dodo and die off like the miserable pieces of shit they are. I never once watched Survivor, and the craze around it was borderline hysteria. •	Friends.	Even the best shows need to end.  Look at Cheers.  If you think Friends doesn’t need to end, experience something new, go jump off an airplane and fly through a fire hoop at 100 miles per hour before pulling the chute.  Sitcoms have shelf lives, they cannot go on forever. Simpsons, I’m looking at you as well.  Now I usually wouldn’t say what a colossal geek I am and be a fan of Babylon 5, but it works out nicely here.  Here’s a saga that told its story, ran its course, and ended on a high note.  None of this “let’s see how long we can string the series along… let’s give one of the main characters triplets! That would be so awesome!” crap. Long shows need to end.  Let new blood come and let the old episodes be released on DVD. •	The Pope’s Health.	Once again, hold off on the crucifixes…  I mean no harm.  The Pope’s health has been failing, which sucks.  Now having said that, I don’t understand the desire to put him out like a puppet for all to see and revere. *Voice over* Yes, be spiritual, and you can be held up by God’s graces long after your body has told your soul, “Look, I’m done, go back to Heaven.” * I honestly think the man is more spiritual than anyone and done as much as he can to correct the wrongs of his predecessors and forge new paths to peace, but just like the sitcoms, he should be allowed to step aside and die in spiritual peace.  It’s just like why we keep someone alive long after it’s clear they are suffering more than living.  If I ever get so bad that I can’t function, there will be no life support, there will be no rest home. I will live as I always have and when it’s my time to face the eternal judge, I’ll argue as hard as I can for a good life, but when it’s my time, it’s my time.  I think it’s the Pope’s time.  Let John Paul II rest.  That’s my deal with 2003.  Goodbye and I hope to see you in ‘04  Burning up the old, reborn in the new…  -- Jake "The Phoenix" Kozak

       I am Pop Culture   	I am an American.  I know what it is like to be free and expect these freedoms to be protected by the government chosen by me.  These said freedoms allow me to be who I want to be, say what I want to say, live how I want to live, and play how I want to play.  No one has the power to take my freedoms away from me, unless I do something against these protected freedoms.  If I kill another man, I am still allowed to be represented by an attorney.  I am read the Miranda and shoved to the floor (harshly) because I have gone against the code of society established by Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Homer Simpson.  Homer Simpson?!  What?!  This fictional character, created by one of the most influential cartoonists ever, next to Schultz, Davis, Watterson, Parker & Stone, Judd, and Disney, has the power of the founding fathers?  Most definitely…  	The majority of today’s culture does not follow the examples led by our elected leaders, the people who keep our country strong and worth fighting for.  But then again, what do we fight for? I’ll tell you.  	We fight for Pop culture.   		 	Pop culture allows our feeble minds to understand the complexities the children of our past would have been taught at the age of five, if not sooner.  Pop culture gives the regular Joe Shmo the power to quote Shakespeare at the drop of a hat.  Pop culture provides a person with the “intelligence” to give a lecture on a complex mathematical formula, or write an eighty-page dissertation on the art of war and growing technology.  Pop culture teaches a four-year-old child to question the existence of God and Santa Clause because of their favorite movie.  These aren’t necessarily bad results, but are the means a credible way to learn?  Does it really matter where one gets their information, as long as they have the information?  Since the general populous learns these complexities from Pop culture, and most of the time, incompletely, will our society be affected by it?  Has perception already been altered?    	A Collage:  All I need to know about life I learned from questionable resources.  		I learned Hamlet, III.i, from a notorious “Bad Boy” of SNL.   		I learned the general concept of entropy and “chaos theory” from a man whose claim to fame was dressing up as a giant bug in a movie that made me think twice about looking through my medicine cabinet. 		I learned there is a disease research facility in New Hampshire with the capability to destroy mankind from a story about the apocalypse, a man who plays with fire, and Abigail Freeman.   		I learned there are five classes or tornados from a man who made me laugh in “Aliens” and a woman who made me cry in “As Good as it Gets.”   		I learned hundreds of philosophical theories from a man with a hat overlooking a fence as he explained them to a man with the intelligence of a Binford 5000 power drill.   		I learned there is a Santa Clause from a letter written in a newspaper to a small girl.  . 		I learned there is no Santa Clause from a Kay Bee toy advertisement in a newspaper.

I learned the puffer fish could be poisonous, when eaten, from Homer’s Jay’s near death experience.

I learned the supposed hierarchal organization of angels in the afterlife from a man who owns a New Jersey comic book store. 		I learned Edward the Longshanks of England was a bastard for a king from Mad Max.   		I learned pornography is an art form from an unexpected visit to a particular website when trying to research “rooster fights.”    		I learned…I learned…the tip of the iceberg.  		Perhaps it is OK to be filled with valid information from questionable resources.  Perhaps it is good enough to be able to formulate an opinion on a certain subject by basing it on what we have heard in a song, seen in a movie, or read somewhere.  Perhaps this is all fine and dandy.  But look at the result.  Power lies with fiction and embellishment.  “Braveheart” is not an exact account of Edward the Longshank’s actions, but many will assume what they see as 100% true.  “The Simpson’s” have entertained us for years with clever anecdotes and witty referential one-liners that make us laugh because we think we know what they are talking about.  No one is as smart as the media, and no one can avoid being exposed to misnomers and bent truths.  	 		The world no longer listens to the President or his cabinet anymore.  They would much rather get their news at 10:00 p.m. on Comedy Central.    --Don “Ghostwriter” Amodio

      This guest writer (and hopefully soon-to-be regular contributer) I met at a plastic table in a tiny room in the bowels of south campus one scorching sumnmer afternoon. We were there for a summer job and this was to be the first of many nearly pointless meetings. He was rocking back and forth and talking 1,000 miles an hour to a group of young woman at his table - That's right -  his  table. He'd made it his somehow. We've grown to become good friends since that day. I've come to know him to be one of the most unique and honest human beings I've had the pleasure of meeting. Ram Subramanian Iyer, ladies and gentlemen.   And now, for no particular reason, the Canadian Flag and national anthem... (please stand and remove your caps)     O Canada! Our home and native land! True patriot love in all thy sons command.  With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and free!  From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.  God keep our land glorious and free! O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.  O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.   Sign the guestbook, you wonderful canuks! :::tear:::      This one's a doesy... hold on to your life.... ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Manifesto    One night I ran out of excuses as to why I couldn’t make a difference.  Just like many of my friends I often complained about how the corporate world manipulates the United States’ politics in order to fatten its own bank accounts at the cost of culture and life elsewhere in the world, allowing for human rights atrocities across the world and in the United States committed in the name of the American Dream.  Perhaps an example would help.  One does not have to look too far into the past to find evidence of the United State’s government’s two handed approach.  With the current war in Iraq, declared finished, but with a rising death toll, the Bush and Blair governments breached many fundamental principles of the United Nations, beginning with waging war without the approval of other permanent members, each with its own politico-economical agenda and international human rights violations problems.  Furthermore, weapons of mass destruction are yet to be found.  Not to mention, the extremely lucrative oil and infrastructure contracts are being handed to Halliburton with motions to block other contributing nations from receiving contracts.  And the best progress of freedom of speech and expression in New Iraq: incarceration of Iraqi workers (shipyard workers and other infrastructure personnel who found themselves without employment when the very government that paid them was laid to rest) without counsel for organizing strikes to protest the placement of foreign nationals in positions rightfully theirs.    The end result of all this international bureaucratic skullduggery and war-mongering is this: the American public can have a wonderful, quasi-peaceful life, while their days away at the nearest Mall heedless of the real depth of woe and misery surrounding the very comforts they adorn their houses with, happy with the odiously biased, obnoxiously repetitive tripe on television misnamed news.  In addition, the about face in social values concerning video game and violence in the film industry is astounding but expected in the face of rising propaganda in US television networks – everything from once abhorred violent video games now packaged under “good defeats evil” war games to advertisements selling the thrill of flying for the air force by comparing it to extreme sports is being aggressively marketed to music from current formula rock hits bopping a recruiting-age generation.      The only answer I can find to the question why the American public is not out in droves protesting the perversion of the very constitutional rights their children have taken for granted is that we are conveniently distracted by the innumerable array of gadgets and devices and ‘fashion’ thrown at us, neatly packaged under Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s, Easter, Spring, and Summer Sales, complete with people lined up for five dollar off coupons at six a.m. in the blistering cold, thank you very much proletariat America that hides under the name of middle class.  And to those of you who find this material quite familiar but haven’t done anything about it, go fuck yourself.  Or do something.  And if you don’t like my language, allow me to make it clear that I’m only as pretty as your pretensions of friendship and respect for the boss whose job you envy.  Because being boss usually means telling someone else what to do.    Understand that I was and am one among you; only, I decided to sit down and think my problems out.  Hence this manifesto.  That you are reading this line is testimony to the fact that I, Ram Subramanian Iyer, have done something about sights so familiar, they are now simply offensive.  I am just another ordinary person working a job to pay the bills, trying to get an education, and with an avid interest in filmmaking but with no access to methods of distribution or production involving a lot of money or saying something I don’t really want to simply to get my foot in the door; only, all these days, I was blaming the System, the Government, the Media, that beautifully orchestrated three ring circus show replete with in flight Jacuzzis, Asian masseuses who go the extra mile, and a whole shit load of cocaine and speed that’s bad for the masses but never questioned at major contributors’ parties.  I’m tired of the hypocrisy, the conniving, the posturing.  I was blaming these people not worth half a thought for keeping me down, for telling me what to say or not to say, while coolly enjoying my comforts and a lifestyle that these very real social power-houses dictate.  Now, I will no longer run after comforts that I know for a fact, after having done research, cause someone else pain.  I do not want to contribute to this system anymore.  I’m tired of being taken advantage of, mentally and physically, tired of my voice being shit on, and deathly afraid of losing my history to apathy.    And what about you who might be just like me?  An ordinary person with a job, a goal, and something to say regardless of how:  perhaps you are a writer, a poet, a thinker, a filmmaker, a musician, a photographer, trapped by the very need for money to produce amazing looking, high budget, extremely bureaucratic, industry driven, profit making products at the expense of your vision and true Voice?  You who do not want to bow to the expectations and limitations put on your form and content because someone else does not deem it appropriate for public consumption, heedless to the fact that it is that very public among whom you live, who motivate your need to create? You who, just like I, despise the glamour, the glitter, the meaningless notions of individuality and freedom sold in Abercrombie catalogs?  We who know a life and a world and a bias those controlling and helping control 51% of the world's wealth will never know or acknowledge or do so only to point a finger.  Children of parents who know what it is to move to a different country with a thousand dollars and four mouths to feed?  Children whose parents walked three miles in dead winter to work at a pizza place because their qualifications are from a different country, and we all gotta hustle.  You, I, we, who have stood with our parents in the six a.m. lines not because they loved a good sale, because that’s how they kept us decently clothed.  Children who know what handouts are anyway, and learn to discriminate real early between a handout and a sincere act of kindness.  Who refuse to give up principles for a more convenient lifestyle based largely on systematic scape-goating and laziness.  Who have nothing but a will to succeed and refuse to blindly support an economy at the cost of someone else's well being.  Who are tired of people telling us we speak good English.  Do we?  Well then.  We are the people who prefer the dust shimmering off an old book languishing in some attic for a sincere touch to pry open a whole world of ideas over industry-processed political puppetry.  Who will hear what we have to say about why the system works?  Who will know what it is to be an I, an Us?    I know this much.  I will not claim to be a helpless minority any more.  Numbers will not replace Us; I will no longer be a generic Them.  I am the socially disempowered.  I come in many colours, flavours, hairstyles, tattoos, piercings, and names.  You can call us spics, rics, kykes, chinks, japs, niggers, honkies, towelheads, fags, dykes, punks, jocks, or any other term in this ultra-sensitive assortment of lexical refinery, which, by the by, most dictionaries pretend do not exist; shit, you can even invent names for me.  We are not fazed by intellectual midgets.  We have grown beyond mere name-calling.  We will all be doomed by our inaction, no matter what strata of classification we belong to.  We are the voices that will shriek our sentence.  We have to be heard.  And we cannot do it by becoming corporate fodder, ready for the harvesting.  We will have to become truly an army of one.  We do not need a multi-billion dollar budget filtered through plastic-smile and eau-de-cologne bureaucracy to support us.  We are the foul stench and harsh reality being filtered.  We will not kowtow to inconsistency and complacency.  Our expectations are different.  We are not satisfied with the comforts of modern America, not when they are being bought with lives, regardless of whose or where.  I have never taken life and I DO NOT want to pay for what I have not taken. We are tired of ignorance and democracy paid for by campaign contributions with the best interests of the corporate world in mind.  We are sensible to the fact that our tax dollars which keep this machine running are somewhere along the line involved in somebody’s death and misery. We will take our constitutional rights serious, with heed to the fact that rights are bound with responsibilities.  We will end corporate hegemony over our everyday lives.  Once and for all.  HOW?  The answer lies in the corporate world itself.  In those very coupons.  In those very superfast, supsersmall devices we get sold everyday that we don’t need.  Perhaps you should consider harnessing the energy of glitz and glamour and gift giving this holiday season, or any other season for that matter, towards a better cause: Dissemination of Information and Expression through any Modes Available or Preferred.  If you have something to say, just say it is the basic premise.  It’s time to stop talking about the injustices and inequalities of the world; take some action, take some initiative, for fuck’s sake, get a Voice and let the world know you exist.  Tell ‘em you will not spend the rest of your already-bleak looking life like the limp old neighborhood dog that every kid torments but nobody remembers after it dies.  Because if you never let the world hear you, tell the world you thought, it all dies with you.  And you will have lived for nothing.  In fact, it would have been as if you never even existed.  So let’s give the historians and political scientists along with a smattering of linguists, humanists, and perhaps even psychologists, something write about.  We can re-direct the course of your future history books.    So buy them 100 count CD-R/RW packs by the dozen and videotapes and super fast burners and “great deal on any Gateway computer this holiday season”s’ and use all this shit they throw at you to distribute what you have to say.  Every event in your thinking life is history in the making if you make the appropriate causal connections.  So write your history, sing about it, make a film on it, document it with the 3.2 megapixel digital fancy-ass super-duper-deal-on-refurbished-items camera and use your pirated copy of Photoshop to layer a picture of you taking a dump on your worst corporate nightmare.  Then take the ultra-cool-and-patriotic Hewlett-Packard all-in-one printer from Staples with a $17.00 instant rebate and $60.00 manufacturer’s mail-in rebate to task on recycled sheets from the garbage at your work place where thousands of pages a week are thrown away with only one side printed.  As a last step, gather a group of friends, or even alone, distribute your expression.  Distribute those CDs, those tapes, copies of your photography, or any other documentation of injustice and inequality, including but not limited to obscure information, body counts, vital statistics of world economies, biased laws and entrapping clauses.  Break it down.  All this information can be found on reliable resources online like Reuters and Associated Press, the White House’s official website, and the Library of Congress’ website (great for access to legal mumbo-jumbo); subscribe to other reliable sources of information and dissent online, in schools and communities.  Do not be afraid to talk to people about taking initiative.  Do not let embarrassment or shyness overwhelm the need to disseminate your brainchild to strangers; take pride in your work.  Explain to them why you are doing it; be gentle and fair with your explanation, and ALWAYS be sensible to proper decorum and decency.  If it helps, include a copy of this manifesto with your work; reuse/recycle paper and use up unprinted sides.    Make use of the great deals on web-hosting and domain registration to build a website chronicling your achievements in mass distribution; linking to the site while distributing your material is bound to get you traffic.  The point is, whether or not a monumental change occurs, you would have done everything in your power to scream your stance.  A single act of dissent is more constructive than getting drunk with your friends and complaining about how the Man keeps you down.  The Man is a fabrication in this day and age; the system tells you you need it;  I am telling you, you don’t.  The Man can be bypassed, and now you know how.  Do not just espouse a view; live it.  SPREAD THE AWARENESS.  Albert Camus wrote, “I no longer wish to be happy now, just to be aware.”   Whatever you do, do not die on your history.  You owe it to circumstance.  It has dictated just about everything that has happened to you; but you, to some extent, can make circumstance happen for somebody.  You may open someone’s eyes.  You may let someone know he or she is not alone.  You may give the hobo across the street comfort in pissing his pants because it’s too cold to pull his dick out.  Please, do not laugh at him.  Feed him.  Learn from him.  He knows more than you about circumstance.    So say something, any which way.  The key is in mass distribution.  Here’s where the corporate world can be reamed a new asshole.  The more we buy, the cheaper their shit gets.  Let the money-makers and war-mongerers pay for your media.  Ever wonder why it is in this super-competitive economy that businesses can afford such ridiculous sales?  Because some body else in some other country is getting dirt pay and even less respect and human dignity.  So buy, and buy, and buy, and pay little to nothing and DISTRIBUTE.  For free.  I do not know about you, but I VALUE my intellectual integrity, and take pride in sharing my vision with people.  I cannot bring myself to put merely a PRICE on my work; I will not cheapen all the things that I owe my entity to.  I hope you harbor similar sentiments. Make a name for yourself, make a statement, reach somebody.  And you don’t need ask a damn soul for help.  You don’t need an agent or an art exhibit or a distributor or some scum-bucket politician with an embezzlement problem to flash his empty title to endorse your point of view.  If you truly believe you have something to say, you don’t need intermediaries.  The people are waiting to hear what you have to say.  It’s time to say it.  Nobody can claim to find you.  You have found yourself.  Say it loud, say it proud, till every motherfucker in the house knows what the hell you are about.  People will listen for your sincerity and intellectual testament is probably the most financially and socially sound deal your audience would have been offered.   While the world sleeps, we rumble.   -- Ram S. Iyer

       *** Dexter's Holiday Spectacular! ***  Happy Holiday's to you and yours. Another Christmas is here and I'm in bed with a fever in a pool of my own filth.  I'll say again - to hell with Christmas.  For now, though, I hope you enjoy whatever this is. I wrote it on Christmas Eve in between curling up on the floor and listening to Santa and the elves doing Christmas Rap in my head... yeah... I was really really sick...  ---------------------------------------------------------   DexterAML: I am away from my sanity right now     the dubious world of the random IM – a beginner’s guide    I’m sitting here at home alternately shivering and sweating from fever. I can’t swallow, I can’t breathe, I’m coughing up blood, and, worst of all, I cannot get online.  It occurs to me between hallucinations how much I rely on instant messenger programs for keeping in touch. And, of course, between hallucinations that got me thinking about all the annoying crap that invariably comes with something so useful.   It’s happened to just about all of us. You’re sitting at your PC looking for some quality porn and chatting it up with a couple of friends who are likely doing the same. Or hell, maybe you’re just reading a strongbad e-mail or buying Scandinavian coasters with gold trim from eBay.   Whatever.   Suddenly a message pops up tagged with a screen name that you’re unfamiliar with. You read the name once, the again, then a third time slowly – still no clue who it is. Then, if you’re particularly curious, you ask around to a few folk on our IM list. Granted, if the name is something like HornEwhore22, you can be pretty sure that the person on the other end isn’t looking to strike up kosher conversation. Other times, though, the name is harmless ( Starcrunch72  or  SmurfDance55 ) and we’re all just a bit curious as to who it is. “ Did so-and-so change their screen name and not tell me ?” “ Have I forgotten who this person is? ” “ Is someone playing a prank on me ?” On and on like that in our heads until we ultimately decide to act. And I’ve heard a million different versions of what follows next. The random name is ignored or blocked. Random IMer harasses with an endless barrage of ethnic slurs and threats of a virus. Cyber-nookie is offered. Or, worst of all, they beg you’re your “pic”  . Rarely, though, the person is someone you know or is just a friendly stranger. Most times, however, they’re just assholes who need to be taught a lesson.    What do you do? How do you stop them? Can they really give you a virus? What the hell is going on?   Well kids, I’m the recipient of these whatnot IM’s and  I always accept them. Always.  No – they can not “give” you a virus or in any other way hurt you unless you let them.  Don’t click on their links or accept anything that they try to send you - ever.  It’s never good. You CAN be hurt and annoyed by visiting certain websites – so don’t. Also  NEVER volunteer any information , ever. After that, you’re all set! No clicking, no downloading, and no sharing anything more than a first name… bingo! The stage is set! This means you’re in control of the conversation from this point on. DO what you like! Demand a name and block them when they refuse. When people IM me with mysterious crap and know my name and all that tomfoolery, I am not impressed. I’m provoked to block… which I do. These bastards usually turn out to be people I know using different screen names. I don’t have the time. However, if you’re REALLY lucky, you’ll get someone who right off the bat you’ll know is a stranger. In my opinion, at this point, one can choose to be a victim or to be amused. If they’re an asshole go for the throat and if they’re just a friendly stranger, then you’ll be amused anyway. I talk with them and, most times, they’re assholes who provide me with 10 min of jollies. God bless you, Mr. Random IMer. You’re the source of my salvation on many a boring evening.    Not sure what I’m talking about, kids? Hmmm. Maybe an example is in order. Check out the following. I got a random IM from  missworks2much23  who apparently wanted to show me some dirty and naughty images of her poontang (that’s vagina for you D&D fellas). Instead of cringing or, worse yet, clicking on the link like a moron, I chatted her up. And when she tried to cyber-rape me, I gave her a good reason to get off of her digital knees. This is an honest-to-goodness REAL IM conversation between me and an unknown skank.  Let’s watch…         missworks2much23 : hi... anyone tere?    Drew : Howdy   Drew : how goes?   missworks2much23 : oh your tthere hi...    Drew : Hi    missworks2much23 : a/s/l (age sex loation)?    missworks2much23 : :)   Drew : 23/m/CT   Drew : likewise, asl   missworks2much23 : im 27/f/USA. was lookin at your profile. thought you might like to chat.     Not bad so far, eh? – “She” is just looking to chat. What could possibly go wrong?     missworks2much23 : so what have you been up to dexteeraml?    Drew : http://beernporn.blogspot.com/    missworks2much23 : :)   Drew : it's a blog - my friends and I vent about social ills   missworks2much23 : ool. i was just hangin out watching tv. i was getting kinda horny (*blushes)    Drew : it happens   Ok – warning sign number one. This bitch doesn’t want to chat. She wants some cyber-nookie. Better let her down slow…     missworks2much23 : feel like a litttle cyber fun with me ? please please...     I give her no response – likely I was talking with someone else on IM…    missworks2much23 : i think ill just take that as a yes.... being as that im starting to get real horny here.. lol ok?    Drew : Begging will get you everywhere... except there, love - sorry... I have some integrity, shoddy though it may be   missworks2much23 : was just browsing the profiile thing. looked like you might be an interesting person to chat with.    Drew : I appreciate the offer - sincerely   missworks2much23 : alright how bout i get down on my knees in front of you and help yoou out of your pants?     Ok... I tried being nice to her – I said no. Had to go for the package, did ya? Well then… I think it’s clear That she’s left me no other option…     Drew : Were my genitals not a turgid mass of open sores and weeping warts, I'd oblige you   missworks2much23 : tell me what you want me to do with you ehile i slip out of my panties    Drew : First, I'd like to find a suitable doctor who can prescribe the appropriate medication that I may be cured of this foul condition   missworks2much23 : oh yeah babe.. dont stop. whilee i slide my hand down between my legs and part my moist lips    Drew : I cringe at the unexpected smell wafting from your voluptuous tropical opening   Drew : Sweat beads beneath the dense hair on my back   missworks2much23 : i have some pics on my homepage the link is inmy profile, still working on it ...     Ahhh… so now we’re clear. She doesn’t want my cyber-moneyshot. She wants my credit card number. Heh. I know how to handle these hoes…     missworks2much23 : oh it feeels so good. Im holding your pulsing cock in my hand, my shiny red fingernails dig gently into your balls, while my full, soft lips engulf the mass of your meat    Drew : I adjust my glasses and use your underwear to staunch the sickening flow of disease that is my groin   missworks2much23 : open my website so you can look at me while im sucking you. use the link iin my profile!    Drew : I swipe at the mucous that has congealed beneath my massive nose   missworks2much23 : what do you think of my picss?    Drew : I wipe it on your face as a token of friendship and ecstasy   missworks2much23 : shit the phone. donnt stop stroking it. hold on...    Drew : I am over-eager - I vomit on your soft pink lady-bush   Drew : I rush to the nearest exit sans pants   Drew : I contact the police and hang myself from the basketball rim hanging in your paved garage   [end]   See? Simple and easy! Granted, I got a little creative near the end for kicks. That was gravy. But she left and I didn’t even have to block her. In fact, she’s likely blocked ME! Ain’t life grand? :-D  Sometimes, though, they aren’t just after your digital ding-dong or your wallet. Other times they’re annoying teens who want your picture and, subsequently want to cyber-date, screw, whatever. Christ…. These tramps also get no love from me.  Darkstarr6969  met the Dexter RIGHT AFTER  missworks2much23  fled the scene. It was amazing. I was already in a playful mood and, once she started asking for my “pic” I brought down the hammer. One again, this is a genuine conversation between me and some dude/chick.      Let’s watch…         darkstar6969 : hello   Drew : Howdy   darkstar6969 : how are you   Drew : Decent - yourself?   darkstar6969 : good   darkstar6969 : thx   Drew : I'm assuming this random IM is supposed to spur my curiosity, thus, leading me to seek out your undoubtedly tempting profile which, if I may be so bold, is certain to be wrought with perilous links of all sorts   darkstar6969 : ok   darkstar6969 : well just looking to chat   darkstar6969 : is that so bad   Drew : certainly not     Maybe I’m wrong… maybe she/he just wants to chat a bit…     darkstar6969 : ok   darkstar6969 : so   darkstar6969 : how are you   darkstar6969 : do you have a pic?    strike one…     Drew : ...who are you?    darkstar6969 : i am steph   Drew : a suitably genderless name   darkstar6969 : ok   darkstar6969 : you have a pic    strike two…     Drew : http://beernporn.blogspot.com/   darkstar6969 : what is this   Drew : it is me in text form   darkstar6969 : ok so where ois your pic   Drew : Do you not see?! - I've just given you a view into the sanctum that is my soul   Drew : feast and be merry   darkstar6969 : lol   Drew : arise from your throne of discontentment!   darkstar6969 : ok it is nice   darkstar6969 : but do you have a pic   darkstar6969 : i am a lil lost   Drew : Is that not enough? - What digital representation could possibly equal the unabashed splendor that is my soul woven through naked revelation?   darkstar6969 : ok well i guess you dont have one   darkstar6969 : no reason to beat around the bush'    strike three…I tried to be nice… she wants a “pic” of Dexter? Here it is…     Drew : Dig my monster sausage   darkstar6969 : what   Drew : I beat children   darkstar6969 : you dont   darkstar6969 : i am thinking you are a little wierd   Drew : Is it wrong to ponder the flavor of innocence?   darkstar6969 : you are so sick   Drew : To fondle the ass of a 10 year old boy?   Drew : You deny what you so richly deserve   darkstar6969 : you are so sick you need to be put away   Drew : they cannot fight back   Drew : this I know   Drew : Do you have any kids?   darkstar6969 : this i am not telling you    Drew : I'm a child care professional - I swear   Drew : leave them in my trust   darkstar6969 : you need help you sick bastard   Drew : Because I enjoy youth?   darkstar6969 : you enjoy them in a sick way   Drew : What way is that?   Drew : You tell me here and now that you do not not desire to be locked in a passionate embrace with a toddler  bubbling processed carrots?   Drew : You, ma'am have no soul to speak of   darkstar6969 : you are fucking sick   Drew : Her name is actually Emily   Drew : she likes to fish, swim and skate    Get it? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA…     darkstar6969 : children are precious gifts you don not have sexual realtions   Drew : You obviously don't have children   darkstar6969 : you are so twisted   Drew : Twisted like my fist amidst the supple virgin flesh that is their anus   Drew : *drool*     Alright – I’ve edited out about 30-40 lines of conversation that are essentially the same thing. I talk about doing terrible things to children and she says "You're sick". I think she may have been masturbating to it or something. Anyway amazingly she doesn’t go away… SHE KEEPS TALKING TO ME! Why? Who cares… I’m enjoying it. Time to shift gears a bit...      Drew : and if you were honest with yourself, you'd accept some of the blame as well, young lady   Drew : don' t be so quick to shirk your responsibilities   darkstar6969 : what are you talking about   Drew : Come off it you harpy temptress! Would you honestly have me believe that you did not have this planned from the very start?   Drew : Luring me into your trust and baiting me with smooth erotic cherubs?   Drew : I've filed this conversation and am taking appropriate action - rest assured... the police will be notified within the hour   darkstar6969 : I ALREADY NOTIFIED THEM OF YOU   Drew : Doubtful   darkstar6969 : I AM A HEAD OF YOU YOU SICK BASTARD'   Drew : I can smell your bitch-fear from here    Here’s where I go for the knockout punch… I’m bored and I don’t win my little game unless she goes away… I dig DEEP. Don’t expect this to make much sense…     Drew : I want you inside me   darkstar6969 : stop you are so sick   Drew : I want to dip your braids in wax while you vomit in my face   Drew : it's the only way I can get off   Drew : tell me that you love me - I must hear it once more   darkstar6969 : fuck you    darkstar6969 : sick bastard   Drew : once more for the police report, my love   Drew : you're only strengthening my case - pedophiles like you shall no longer have reign over those innocent children   darkstar6969 : what are you talking about   darkstar6969 : i did not do anything   Drew : How long will you perpetrate your evils behind the monitor?

       Stop this bus, I want to get on - 12/23/03   My commute to work every day takes me through a residential neighborhood, a classic New England street near a lake frozen over and still in the December air. This is an organic block, with the houses facing willy-nilly and in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Two story colonials, one-story starter houses, made of wood and brick and Bob Vila-approved vinyl siding, some with garages and some with sheds, some with broken-down cars littering their gravel stone driveways. This isn’t one of those pre-fab neighborhoods, where all the houses look the same and every yard has the same single sapling planted in the strategic spot in their barely-there front yard, just enough in front to raise the property value but far enough to the right to keep the view from the bay window free. Nope. These houses were built individually, by different contractors and different architects, and each has their own unique and endearing character.    Normally, I manage to get my lazy ass out of bed before 7 AM, which gets me on the way to work well before the school buses start picking up kids. Last week, however, I slept in, and on my mad dash in to work I found myself stuck behind one of those lumbering yellow monstrosities as it worked its way through rural Farmington picking up students.  Now I consider myself a patient man, and only give in to road rage when it is completely justified (people cutting you off, failing to observe signs and traffic signals, police that feel the need to tailgate you in the left hand lane without their flashers on, those bastards). But I was two seconds from going nuclear once I realized that this bus was stopping at every other house to make pickups. Every other house. The road I was on was a half mile in length, at most. The furthest any of these kids would have had to walk to get to a hypothetical bus stop was a quarter mile. What’s that, a five-minute walk? Nope, sorry, this bus was stopping at every single driveway for every single little brat kid.  I hate to sound like some stereotypical old man on this, but didn’t we all have to walk our sorry butts through the snow and ice to our neighborhood bus stop when we were snot-nosed third graders? There was none of this front-door concierge service when I was growing up. There was one stop for every two to three block radius, and that was it. And as much as it sucked when it was snowing or raining, wasn’t the bus stop a cool-ass place to hang out? All the neighborhood kids together without parental supervision, with just enough time before the bus came to raise some quality childhood hell.   This certainly wasn’t the case this fateful morning. Traffic was backed up all the way up and down the street because of the front door service the bus was offering. It amazed me what a wasteful system this was, not only for the traffic and the time involved, but for the parents who were stuck watching their kids at each stop. Why not have one stop, like we used to do, and have one parent each day rotate in to watch the little brats? Instead, each parent had to wait for their kid to be picked up every day before they could get back to their daily routine, whether it be go to work, clean up house, sleep with the milkman, etc. All the cars stalled, all the parents interrupted, and the bus taking close to an hour to finish its route. Things looked about as efficient as a Soviet supermarket.  It seems like our society is getting into trouble with our antiseptic lifestyle choices. The bus stop saga is just a metaphor for how disconnected we’ve all become from each other. I guarantee you the reason why the bus had to stop at each house was because the neighbors didn’t know each other well enough to trust them with their kids. Rather than take the time and effort to get to know each other, to develop the strong bonds of community that allow cooperation to occur, we’d rather petition the school district to pick up everyone right at their door. Never mind the dangers that might befall our kids as they walk three houses down to the communal bus stop. What kind of world do we live in when you can’t feel safe letting your kid walk around your own neighborhood?  That sounds like a paranoid statement to make, doesn’t it? That’s the way our society works nowadays. People are paranoid and skeptical for absolutely no reason. I guarantee you that the neighborhood I was driving in that day hadn’t seen a violent crime committed in decades. The problem is, people’s perceptions are defined more by the 10 o’clock news than their own experiences. Why not extend a friendly invitation to the neighborhood, get to know everyone and confirm for yourself that the surroundings are friendly? No such luck, I suppose.   Add on top of this our fanatical obsession with safety and cleanliness. God forbid our sons and daughters trip on their way to the bus stop and skin their knees, right? We’re raising our offspring in plastic bubbles, where they’re force fed bottled water, made to breathe purified air, forced to swim in chlorinated pools and made to clean themselves with abrasive chemicals and nonspecific antibiotics. From birth we’re forcing them to live on crutches made of HEPA filters and amoxicillin, and they’re no better for it. Incidences of asthma and life-threatening allergies are on the rise in the United States, and many scientists believe that this is directly related to the way we are raising our children. Granted, most parents assume that they are doing what’s right for their children, but since when do you have to pass an aptitude test to become a parent?   We’re stuck with a nation of shrink-wrapped, sanitized children with their umbilical cords still attached, forcing the system to work for each individual while eschewing the community at large. Unfortunately, we have every right as American citizens to stick our middle finger up at the world and refuse to interact. But when everything from medicine to government to even the busses have to make that proverbial stop at every individual house, how can there ever be enough time to take care of everyone’s needs?  It’s time we bring the bus stops back. If not for any of these grandiose reasons, just so I can get to work on time without getting stuck behind some bus picking up your brat child.  -Mr. Carson

       Updates and Assorted Sundries - 12/22/03   My goodness has there been some commotion here at the worldwide headquarters of Beer ‘N’ Porn! I turn away for a few days and when I come back I find more guys have stuck their stuff up in here than in Jenna Jameson. I feel dirty and used, like the box of Kleenex on your nightstand. AND WHERE THE HELL ARE OUR OTHER “OFFICIAL” MEMBERS AT? Don? Jeff the “---“? Ladies and Gentlemen, we have lost all semblance of order here. At least our new guerilla bloggers are doing their best to keep up the BnP standard of quality that we all have come to know and love. Namely, eschewing all attempts at cohesive expository structure in favor of random sexual innuendo, profanity and pathological humor.  And by the way, since when do we have a wreath on our official logo? Let me remind the audience that the snazzy BnP logo was designed by Mr. Dexter himself, who only a few weeks prior stated clearly on this site that he hates all things Christmas. Dramatic Irony? Or simple pandering to the audience? Regardless, I see a disturbing lack of guestbook posts from any of the great countries of Scandanavia. FINLAND! I'm talking to you, buddy.  Before I get down to it, a few updates:  First, the results of last week’s poll. Winning in a landslide for “Best Middle East Spring Break Spot” was that rockin’ little slice of Iraqi paradise, the six-foot hole outside of Tikrit!     Boasting a small sitting area and a severe infestation of rodents and bugs, the six-foot hole attracts tens of thousands of spring breakers each year from colleges around the country. When asked what draws so many people to this dank den of despair each year, students from Texas A&M responded, “The importance of this site in our nation’s history, of course. That and the bitches in Tikrit put out!” Early in the coming year, Playboy plans on issuing a special Spring Break edition of its magazine, focusing on the wild and raucous parties that rock the hole each year. Playboy’s publisher, Hugh Hefner, claims to have nude photos of First Lady Laura Bush dancing the “’Pon de River” with Donald Rumsfeld during last spring’s wet T-shirt contest, and plans on publishing those in the spring break issue.   Coming in as a ridiculously distant second place is both Tel Aviv, Israel, and Kabul, Afghanistan. Tel Aviv, while previously claiming the Middle East spring break popularity trophy, has seen a decline in interest over the past few years since the initialization of widespread military reprisals from the Sharon Administration for Palestinian terrorist attacks, along with the closing of the local Hard Rock restaurant famous for having Tiny Tim’s ukulele on display. Kabul is in the midst of a rebirth in popularity, as the U.S. military continues to bomb the bejeezus out of everything in sight to make up for its inability to find Osama bin Laden. For more info, check out the  urlLink Survival Guide to Kabul  – your resource for finding the best in Kabul nightlife!  Sadly, receiving no votes whatsoever were Tehran, Iran, and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Tehran has been trying desperately for years to improve its tourism image, but little things keep getting in the way, that little hostage snafu a few years back. Not surprisingly, no one wants to visit Riyadh for vacations, because as we all know Saudi Arabia serves as the epicenter for theocratic terrorist organizations throughout the area.  Sadly, that’s no joke. Where do you think bin Laden made all his contacts and financial connections?  Check out this week’s subversive poll, and make sure to leave comments! We here at Beer ‘N’ Porn want to hear the voice of the electorate!  Secondly, I have sad news to report. I diligently checked and re-checked the books here at the Beer ‘N’ Porn accounting department, just like any responsible member of Enron or the Connecticut state Executive Branch would, and I still see a lack of accounts receivable. What does this mean? BUY OUR SHIT! BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY! BUY! BUY SOME MORE! And then, BUY!  As Dexter would say, ‘Tis the season to BUY BEER ‘N’ PORN MERCHANDISE! So won’t you pledge your support today? All profits go directly to the Beer ‘N’ Porn Children’s Charity, which like any responsible faith-based charity pockets 99.99% of each dollar earned and blows it on material possessions for its employees. Do the right thing this holiday season and BUY!  So much for the administrative horse puckey. I'll be posting again tomorrow, about noonish.   And back to poundin' the egg nog I go,  -Mr. Carson

      What can I say... another potential addition to the Beer 'n Porn family has submitted some mindless drivel. His name is Sasquatch... long time friend, life time brother, my long-reaching right arm, and a permanent pain in my friggin' ass.  What can I say, I love the kid.  He learned to read and write just 3 years ago. When I found him he was lost in the woods subsisting on nuts, berries, and the occasional honey bun. I convinced the administration at the University to admit him and... well... the rest is history. HE cooks for me so I really have nothing awful to say... I do so enjoy spaghetti... and pork chops... (hint hint) Lend an ear to the wild one. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.   Hold on to your fur, kids...  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   SUV’s, Ditches, and You: A love story    Last weekend brought the second true snowstorm of the year, and though the roads were in their usual shitty condition, covered with snow and slush and sleet and ice, I was out there. I was driving through the madness, making my way determinedly through the mess and muck.  “Are you a mailman?” some may ask. I say “No.” Some may even think I drive an SUV, with their fancy four wheel drive and bigger engines, to force themselves across the icy roads.  Nope, no SUV either.  Not to say that they weren’t out there. As I slogged my way through the wintry wastes, I saw SUV after SUV pass me on the highway, their drivers believing blindly that the magic of four wheel drive would save them from the powers of that great physical force, Inertia.   Amusingly enough, I saw more SUVs and trucks than cars on the side of the road, covered in snow, or trying to get themselves out of a ditch that their careless driving had slid them into.   No, friends, I do not drive an SUV. I don’t drive a truck. I don’t have four wheel drive, and, frankly, I don’t want it. I drive a 1989 Plymouth Horizon – a small hatchback with a 2.2L engine that pulls the car’s svelte 845 lb. frame along. I think Lewis Black did a bit on the Horizon once, but I don’t think he had a very charitable opinion on the matter.  This car has the snow traction of Wile E. Coyote with a banana peel under his feet – that is to say, very little, if any at all. It’s light and relatively powerful for its size, which doesn’t bode well when you don’t want the car to slide or the wheels to spin. Hit the gas a bit too hard, and the wheels spin in place, sending a flume of snow from the front tires. Try and turn too sharply on an icy road, and you’ll slide off the road like the four year old girl at figure skating lessons for the first time. Try and drive over some snow that’s any deeper than nine inches or so, and the car will likely strand itself on the snow like a beached whale, the tires unable to reach the ground.  Sounds like fun, huh?  Some people may be thinking to themselves, “If you are driving in the snow so much, why don’t you just get a truck/SUV/dogsled?” Four wheel drive and more weight should help you be safer in the snow, right?  As the cars in the ditches might tell you, four wheel drive doesn’t make up for stupidity.  This is a big problem facing us these days – dipshits with SUVs and drivers’ licenses. I’m not really complaining about any of the usual issues that people associate with the vehicles – low gas mileage, low safety, consumer indulgence, etc etc. I’m not an activist and I see no real gain in pissing and moaning about how they waste so much gasoline and they take up too much space. I just laugh when I fill up my gas tank for $15, and the gauge on their pump is at $38 and still counting.  Essentially, I’m complaining about bad drivers. I’m complaining about people who pay $25,000, $30,000, or more on a car, and then expect this behemoth to take care of them when the snow comes around. Four wheel drive means it’s good in the snow, right? They’re also the first ones to point out all of the fancy schmancy technological advances that were included in the car that helps them in the snow. I could write three thousand pages on how much I despise the arrogance that is fog lamps (but that is for another time).  Snow driving is a very difficult task that requires a lot of practice and preparation. I spent a lot of time my first winter learning about how cars move in the snow, and how to counteract the car’s motion when it starts to slide. Granted, I spent most of the time doing donuts in the parking lot at my high school, but I practiced until I felt comfortable with it. Most people who buy SUVs assume that with the scented floor mats they get a security blanket, and they’re always the ones who are surprised when they end up with their chariot lying sidewise in a ditch on the side of the highway, waiting for the tow truck to drag it home for them.   This merely illustrates an issue I have with American consumerist and materialist culture. The idea that a better piece of equipment will automatically make you capable of things you could not previously do pervades a great chunk of the marketing and advertising that you face every day.   Our athletic shoes will let you jump like Michael Jordan. Our baseball bat will let you hit like Barry Bonds. Our gloves will let you catch like Ichiro Suzuki. Our car will let you drive like Michael Andretti. Our computer will make your kid smarter.  It’s all bullshit. Those athletic shoes are no better than foot covers if you weigh 300 lbs. That baseball bat it still just an expensive piece of firewood to Grandpa. That glove is just an ex-cow if you have the hand-eye coordination of a blind wombat. That Porche will still slide into a ditch if you take a corner too quickly. And that computer is useless if your kid doesn’t study as it is. He’s just gonna be watching three second clips of porn and reading subversive stuff that some yahoos have been posting online - hey, kinda like this!  So, when I do things, I eschew that expensive equipment. I play paintball - I have a lower end marker. I still do rather well. I ski. I bought used equipment, and it works perfectly. and I love to drive in the snow and other times - with a car that I bought from my father for $400.  Next time you think about getting into a new pastime or picking up a new hobby, spend more time working on the basics and technical skills required, and spend less money on unnecessary equipment. Become better at what you do than contribute to the crap that’s foisted on us all the time.  Peace.   --Sasquatch

       Alright... this is getting a little ridiculous. Yet another kid has coerced me into posting his one-handed jibberings. What the fuck? Not to mention the fact that this lil' bitch still didn't sign the guestbook... (hint hint)  :::shaking head:::  Alright fine... I eat his food... sleep on his couch... make sweet sweet wonderful love to his mom...  plus I touched my junk and then touched his face and he was all like, "whatever"....   :::lack of understanding:::  So I'm posting this crap. Fine. And, you know, I actually read it and it's not total nonsense so already he's got a leg up on half of my work. I mean I should just be happy that someone else beside myself is finally writing, right?...  :::grumble:::  I better be getting some Spaghetti-O's out of this deal... or some scotch or something...   Here it is...  ...and sign the guestbook for crissakes....  --Dexter   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   (Insert responsible title here)   Well, I figured it’s time to throw my hat into the intellectual foray that is this blog.  Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, so did I the day of and after my birthday.  (In case you can’t figure it out yet, I’m the person Dexter’s December 8 article is about)  I figured it would be appropriate to discuss something that’s been irritating the hell out of me with people lately.  What I am referring to, of course, is personal responsibility. Now, why is it that I have decided to bitch about this? Was it Dexter’s talk about the yummy scrumptious babies that happen when people finish coitus? Was it the old rant on God is and does He or She exist?  Well, it’s a combination of the two, complete with my own beer-battered, deep-fried, baked and blended two cents to add to the mix.  Now, I realize I haven’t said anything about it right now, and I would say that I am to blame for that. I’m the one writing it, so it’s my fault.  There, personal responsibility.  People nowadays are completely unwilling to own up to their own actions.  In the Corporate world, look no further than Enron, the entire board denies any wrongdoing even when the evidence is thrown right in their faces.  In more recent news, take a look at Martha Stewart. That bitch damn well knew she was engaging in insider trading and still she denies that she did anything wrong.  HELLO, someone high in a company tells you something that will make or break a company, and you do something with your holdings, suck it up Martha, I hope your fellow inmates will show you the true meaning of a “Christmas Bouquet.”  Because of the fact that everyone sees these huge corporations dodging social responsibility, they assume that they can lie, cheat, and steal.  Let’s look at what goes on deep in the realm of Springerdom, where Ricki, and Montel, and Jerry are the lords and ladies of some perverted oligarchy where the rampant unprotected sex produces more kids than Michael Jackson could ever hope to molest. Now I’m not saying that the unprotected sex is the problem, like I said, I’m talking about personal responsibility.  It doesn’t pain me to see that children are being born in this world “by accident,” whether the condom broke, she missed a pill, or the phone rang and startled you when you were going to pull out. What bothers me about the whole thing is that the guys sometimes deny that the kid is theirs (because, let’s face it folks, the women are da hoes, right?) or that even if they acknowledge that it is their child, they refuse to take care of him for whatever reason.  That’s the bitch.  Seriously, how the hell can you call yourself any form of human when you damn well know that you caused a life to come into the world, and then choose not to take care of it?  I thought exposing was a relic from Ancient Greece.  We’re no longer physically exposing our unwanted kids to the elements, killing the undesired off, the ones we do allow into the world are being exposed socially and emotionally.  I don’t think I could have made it 21 years without both of my parents. Does that make me weak? Maybe.  However, with all seriousness, take care of your fucking kids. There’s nothing more irresponsible than not taking care of one of your own that you caused.  Parents, don’t think you aren’t falling under the knife tonight.  Parents are letting their kids get out of control.  They are YOUR children. Now I’m not advocating abusing kids, but I know that through discipline I learned how to take care of myself in the world. (I can just hear the bleeding hearts now about how I got spanked as a kid.  Get over it. I deserved every one.)  And some advice to parents:  The television is not a babysitter!  Don’t just plop little Timmy down in front of the boob tube while you go out. The flashing images on the TV is no replacement for taking little Johnny to the store with YOU, even if he is a whiny little bastard and an embarrassment to you when you can’t control him after YOU have pumped enough sugar in him that he could cause avalanches with the sound of his screams.  Simply put, YOU are responsible for your kids, because they don’t know any better, and nor will they know any better unless YOU show them the way.  Let’s go back to me for a second, ‘cause I’m not immune to this either.  A couple of Saturdays ago my friends got me absolutely stumbling drunk and all that to celebrate my 21st birthday.  Now, let’s say for a minute that something happened that day and I ended up in the hospital, or worse, dead.  Now, I in the hospital on life support from breaking ribs from vomiting so hard and having the shards cut through my stomach would undoubtedly suck ass, so I’m glad I avoided such an extreme fate.  All I had to show for it was being carried to my bed by my friends, and them wondering if I’d be ok.  (See the Dec. 8 article for the details)  The point is that they didn’t tell me to do anything I wasn’t already in the mindset to do. Hence, if I were to have gotten hurt, there’s no one to blame except for me.  They (meaning my friends) put me in that environment, but I was definitely the one who ultimately decided to go with it.  Ergo, even if I did blame them for my getting hurt (which I wasn’t) the blame still lies with me, because I did it of my own free will. I don’t buy this whole “I was drunk so whatever I did shouldn’t count” shit.  If you were stupid enough to drink so much that you did something really stupid, then you need to own up to it. In fact, any of the things that I did that I felt bad about on my birthday the appropriate people and authorities have been apologized to.  What am I getting at?  Does this kid ever shut up?  Yes, very soon.   This whole diatribe is about one thing: Owning up to your own actions.  Don’t start blaming others when things go to shit.  Not every bad thing that happens to someone is a conspiracy by the Martian Council to fuck up John Q Public’s life.  I’m not saying we all should be angels, but if you fucked up, and you’re called on it, then stop the bullshit and own up to it, and face the consequences.  And if you’ve just read this whole thing and are disgusted by it, you have no one to blame but yourself.  ‘Til I rise from the ashes again…  --Jake "The Phoenix" Kozak

       ¿¿What the hell am I talking about??     After writing the following, I had zero idea what it really was about… but there were lots and lots of words there and I didn’t really want to delete them. I mean they worked so hard to make me happy. So there they are…. yeah. If you can figure out what the hell I was writing about, leave me a clue and a NEW title for this rant in the guestbook. First 5 relevant responses get posted in my next piece “ So THAT’S what I was talking about, Willis! ” Meantime, enjoy the nonsense….   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   I’m not a big dicked-white woman chasing-malt liquor drinking-rap music listening-break dancing, drug dealing-white man hating-“brotha from da mutha fuckin streets”. Doesn’t that suck? I mean don’t it?  	….    Today’s grimy episode isn’t about much of anything including blackness or whiteness although God knows that I could go on writing for months on that topic alone. However, if I were bound to label it, this would be about you people who take offense to everything. This goes out to those who hate everyone and everything and everything about everything and anything. This love note is addressed to that darling flock of morons that we all know at least one of (and no I’m not talking about those kids on the short bus) and the ideology that they use. This lil’ tidbit is for you, America… land of the free, home of the brave… land where ski and don’t own no slaves…. lan… (lame… stopping there).  It’s been written about at least sixty thousand times (in sixty-thousand term papers, newspapers, and English papers) by author’s who are no older than last week’s “Yo mamma so fat” jokes. Somehow they feel that they can buck against the norm and become some quasi-hippie coolness guru by being opposed to the concept of coolness altogether while simultaneously showing mom that she can’t rule their lives by shifting their little underdeveloped social “gears” into reverse and lashing out against everything and everyone that has the slightest tinge of “trendy”.  You know… because it’s the cool thing to do.   These poor bastards have little to no opinion except the opposite of what you think. Sad, angry, wanna be-vigilantes “saluting” their Brittany Spears and Denise Richards posters with their left hands while typing whinny opinion articles under pseudonyms like “eXtReMe SK8Tz” and “aNaRcY ReIgNs” with their right hands. (I realize that attacks opinion articles in my very own opinion article is ironic at best and hypocritical at worst… I’ll leave it to you to sort out how you feel about that…) Sorry Jr.  Contrary to the ever popular handbook “How to Score with Hot 80’s Babes” and it’s counter part “How to Pick Up Killer Chicks with Huge Racks who TOTALLY PUT OUT”, girls don’t dig guys with scabs on their palms due to “practicing” for “the big night”, Settle down, Jr. You’d think that Ed McMahon was somewhere between the sheets with a score card and a goofy oversized check for ten million bucks and a life insurance policy.    	But I digress…     At some point in the early 90’s, it became inappropriate to be honest. For example, in 1989 I could call homeless gay black midgets (with clubbed feet, lazy eyes and HIV) fucking gimped out freaks of nature whose sole purposes were:  (a  The amusement of those of us who are not infirmed   And  (b A life of eternal servitude as crash test dummies, “living cadavers”, lab rats, and others such odd stations that further the advancement of human technology when we tire of their freakish exploits  	I could say this all… without much fear of the dreaded “PC police”  Today if I breathe wrong in the vicinity of a mule who’s owner once read about a movie in a magazine which has an article written by a Jew, I’m not only called a racist, but I’m showered with a host of other brutally misused buzzwords which further clarify the injustices played out by myself upon an unsuspecting innocent. Fuck off. If I were to insult a Jew (or anyone for that matter), I’d be a shitload more bitter and creative. It’s as if we’re only allowed to use marshmallow words.   Television is certainly no help. Let’s ignore the talk shows with their herded audiences screaming about morality and decency to neo-fascist transgender Satan worshipers and focus a bit on these court shows. What kind of madness is this? Didn’t we create enough uneducated justice nuts in the days when Judge Wapner wielded the gavel? Now we want to pour more losers into the mix by bringing in a host of newer psuedo-judges? And is it me or is it a requirement to have a 19 in metal rod jammed deep into one’s ass before he/she/it can host one of these “shows”? Judge Mills Lane apparently took one too many on the chin and hasn’t “left the ring” and I’d venture to guess that Judge Judy was never hugged by her dad as a child…. well maybe a special “sausage” hug. And the ass-backward trailer trash that they allow on these shows?!… oh my… and you thought your prom date was a loser… Apparently a double digit IQ is cause for immediate disqualification as a candidate for the show. They definitely were skimming the shallow end of the gene pool for these winners.   No no, Peggy-Bob. The squirrel fucking Marxist grave-robbing necrophiliacs are wanted on the Springer set… those guys are MUCH too classy for Judge Joe Brown.   Need I even mention Jerry Springer? I didn’t think so. I could pull a better final thought out of Ricki Lake’s ass with Montel Williams’s tongue.   Granted, the last 3 paragraphs really didn’t help solidify my point at all. I know this. And, fact, I don’t much agree with what I just typed. It sorta shlunked out of me like so much poo. Such is the nature of a rant. Get over it.   Back to the point…  Somehow we’ve spawned a new breed of opinionless zombies who worship their televisions and their children. Don’t judge! Don’t offend! Don’t assert! God forbid I should be against gun control or abortion. Hell, for that matter, God forbid I should believe in anything contrary to mainstream opinion. I mean, then I’d be taking a stand… I’d be myself… I’d ACTUALLY be an individual with an opinion…  The word individual has been so horribly bastardized that it no longer brings names like Socrates to mind. Instead (and I’m not making this up) I think of a box of ho-ho’s- all individually wrapped for freshness.   I could go on forever but I doubt that I’d ever be able to make my case so here it is in a nutshell. Turn of the idiot box and try a book (you know, those funny looking things that you’re always banning and burning)… take a stand, it’s ok. People are supposed to disagree… it’s what makes the world go ‘round. and finally, don’t shun the masses of brainwashed self-deluded hippie hopefuls who have anestitised themselves (and likely others) to the harsh yet satisfying reality that we aren’t all different or all the same. We are ourselves if we ever choose to be those people. Period. Take a good look at yourself and try your best to emulate that person. Trust me. You’ll be all the more grateful.      --Dexter Otis Green       Well there you have it... tell me what the fuck this was about (if anything) and give it a new title while you're at it... and remember ... the first 5 relevant responses get posted in my next piece “ So THAT’S what I was talking about, Willis! ”   D.O.G.   --fin

       Children: Nature’s ultimate prank    Sex. It’s been all the rage for centuries - two people, two sets of throbbing genitalia, two steamy sweaty bodies longing to satisfy a deep primal urge slapping together in a crazy 2/4 rhythm - bitter to some and all too familiar to others. We build our television and radio shows around it. We dress in hopes of getting it. We even have establishments that are more or less specifically designed to help you get your freak on with one or more of their many skanky patrons. Hell, we even have a nearly inexhaustible supply of euphemisms for intercourse- doing it, making it, hittin’ it, beating it up, giving it, getting it, banging, “home”, Fucking, shagging, humping, the horizontal mambo, the horizontal bop, making love, riding the bologna pony, burying the purple headed warrior, going “all the way”, screwing, getting laid, scoring, and my personal favorite, doin’ tha nasty (awwww yeah)… you get the picture.   Today I’ll skip the sarcasm and get right to the point.   Drew is pissed about unprotected premarital sex.  In 1995, more teens left Hartford’s Weaver High School with babies then diplomas. In my family alone, I have 5 or 6 nephews and nieces (not to mention the one on the way) and my oldest sibling is 24 and unmarried. All of these (scrumptious) babies making (tantalizing) babies, screwing like rabbits to prove their love or their masculinity and not one has the brainpower to scrounge up a condom, a pill, a diaphragm or even a cold shower. “It doesn’t feel the same” and all those other bullshit excuses for avoiding protection don’t fly well with me. Babies (yummy) can’t be tucked back into the vagina like so much undone casserole. These kids are being born to parents who wanted nothing more than a lil’ bit o’ nookie. Hell, half of YOU may have started out as a hardon and some naughty fingers in the back of a volkswagon.   I’ll let you all in on a little secret.   Sex = (delicious) babies.      I’ll give the slower folk time to catch on…   …there you go.  “Whoa there, Drew! Sex isn’t just about making (mouth-watering) babies. It’s an intimate expression of love. Hell sometimes it’s just a great way to unwind! I think you’re over simplifying this “sex” thing.”  …  ummm…   …:::middle finger:::  The primary function of sex, although it may be about love or what have you at times, is to “make (scrumptious) babies”. That’s the only thing about sex that is constant. (Ok, granted, homosexuals would beg to differ with me on this one and, well, I can’t really disagree. For the purpose of this rant, though, I’m gonna focus on the heteros).   Humans have been trying to find ways around this “problem” for centuries. We’ve tried everything from different food combinations, cloth sacs, ritual chants and dances to the more modern condoms, diaphragms, and injections to get all the pleasure of sex without running into that pesky (finger-licking good) baby problem. Unfortunately none of these methods are 100% effective - especially when the people employing them use them improperly. C’mon, kids… how hard can an anti-fertility dance be for the traditional moron? Shake, shake, dip, spin, THEN stomp!! And be sure to employ the TRADITIONAL form maracas instead of these fiberglass plastic hybrids. They aren’t nearly as effective as their balsa wood cousins.   AIDS is more attractive than abstinence, it seems. The cessation of sexual activity elicits the same response as voluntary castration.  "Sweet Jesus! How do you expect me to live without my precious precious tang!”  or  “Mother of God! I need the wang all up in my junk at least 3 times a day or I’ll go mad! MAD I TELLS YA!”  The elephant man has better odds with a nationally televised three-way with Terry Hatcher and some unnamed soccer mom than I do of convincing goddamn horny teens to simply keep their friggin' pants on. There are hundreds… nay, THOUSANDS of things lovers can do without penetration. Get creative, junior. You’ll keep yourself dandily Un-daddified and frankly, she’ll appreciate your love all the more if it’s not running down her leg.   Vaginal intercourse ISN’T the ultimate in Freakology 101.   ...Trust me… it’s all about the tongue.  …but I digress.   You don’t want (tangy) babies? Don’t want to be faced with the possibility of an abortion or giving your kid up for adotion?   Stop Fucking. Period.  “But Dexter, surely you jest! Why I’ll bet that you are probably running the streets with your pants around your ankles as we speak! How dare you judge me when you are guilty of the same crime!”  Hate to disappoint you, slim, but, barring some creative advances in science, there’s no way that (delectable) babies are popping out of my hole of choice. And, by the by, when I was laying down with that special lady someone I understood (on some level) the consequences. I wouldn’t have been surprised that she got pregnant no matter how careful we had been (I myself was born despite birth control - mama on the pill and daddy using a condom. Take that, Trojan.). If she had ended up pregnant, believe you me, I’ll be the last one chanting “abortion” which, by the way, is conveniently becoming synonymous with “condom”.   Radio announcer:  To lazy and horny to slap on a rubber? NO PROBLEM! Dr. Flushimout will take care of that pesky unwanted (savory) baby lickety split! Ray’s Abortion Clinic! No fetus can beat us!   Listen I don’t doubt that some abortions save the life of the mother and are thereby “necessary” but I find it hard to believe that all women who have abortions do so because their lives are in jeopardy. I won’t dare say that the men haven’t an equal part in that act as well but that’s an entirely different story. In the end, taking more responsibility for where your wang goes (or what wang goes in you) would make the abortion thing less of an issue.  (I’m not gonna get into the whole debate on abortion. It’s gotten more use than a new inmate’s hole. I’ll say that I’m pro-choice.  …  …and yes… that’s because I want to be able to keep digging my dinner out of the dumpster behind Ray’s fine establishment. No fetus can beat us indeed!... ‘specially with merlot.)    My final word? Sex = babies. Don’t let your hardon and irresponsibility ruin your life or the life of some innocent (spicy, sweet, tangy, tasty) baby.  You don’t want kids? Here’s a clue....   Use more tongue or aim for the bung.     'nuff said,   --Dexter

       “Randomness – It’s Dexter Approved!” -12/14/03   So this morning I rolled out of bed, made myself a cup of coffee and turned on the TV. Much to my surprise, there was Dan Rather with a crazed look in his eye saying,   “We got him!”    “Hallelujah! We got A-Rod!" I thought.  Oops.  So the Great American Military-Industrial Complex has finally succeeded in catching Saddam Hussein. Just for the record, the United States Armed Forces are the most technologically advanced fighting force in the world. Hussein is a 66-year-old man who was hiding in a six-foot hole. For some reason, locating him took nine months, untold billions of dollars and 313 American soldiers’ lives. The operation to capture this senior citizen from his foxhole took 600 infantry and members of a special ops brigade.  Six hundred American soldiers for one old man?  Astounding.  I refuse to consider this capture a victory for the Bush administration. It’s a lucky break, and don’t be surprised when this administration milks it for all it’s worth. The capture of Hussein is going to be used as a public relations trump card that the Executive Branch will use to strong-arm increased spending allocations through Congress and force the U.N. to adopt Dubya-approved resolutions concerning the future of Iraq and the awarding of reconstruction bids. Worst of all, to millions of Americans, Hussein has become the symbol of the 9/11 attacks, and Bush will sell his capture photos to the heartland of this country as a sign that the war against terror has finally been won. He’ll wave his smoke and mirrors in our eyes and claim that the war is over, wanting you to forget that Osama bin Laden is still missing, Afghanistan is in complete disarray and the American Military is in complete shambles.   ((Uncontrollable Liberal Rage))  I suppose it’s a good thing in a cosmic sense that Saddam’s in custody. Never mind that the U.S. supported Saddam during his rise to power and during the Iran/Iraq war…((rage building anew))…but I reserve my anger for the sake of the Iraqis. Hopefully this will help turn the tide of public opinion between the Tigris and Euphrates from “let’s blow the fuck outta the Infidels!” to “Yay Americans! We love Krispy Kreme!” Although I’m still a bit skeptic. If you watch the cable news feeds of downtown Baghdad, you see the Iraqis celebrating at the news of Saddam’s capture. Weren’t these the exact same crowds protesting the occupying forces only days ago? I don’t like the idea of my friends and family stuck halfway across the world in a country full of intellectual preschoolers with rocket-propelled grenades – Saddam or no Saddam.  I still think the best answer to the whole debacle would be to build a Great Wall of concrete and steel around the entire Middle East – the “greater” Middle East, mind you. From India and Pakistan (yeah you, with your freakin’ Kashmir fights and mini-nuclear holocaust waiting to happen), all the way to Israel and Palestine. Heck, throw Turkey in there for kicks! Don’t think we don’t see through your ruses, Istanbul! We noticed how you conveniently agreed to help out during Bush War II – by immediately stationing armored divisions in the Kurdish hills, where (surprise surprise!) a number of lucrative oil fields are stationed. You guys looking to take some oil and kill some Kurds? Well then join the fun! Welcome to the new Middle East.  One big wall, fourteen-odd countries. Let ‘em fight it out once and for all. I am 95% convinced that these people will never ever be able to live peacefully together in any amount of cohabitated space. So why bother fighting it? Let ‘em have it all out in the largest steel-cage grudge match ever. Let Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler cover it for pay-per-view. The advertising rights would be worth billions. And this whole Middle East madness can be settled, once and for all.  I’m tired of watching Americans die for other peoples’ petty wars.  I sign off with an anecdote. A good friend of mine in high school had a voracious appetite. Often times my little group of friends would spend the weekends on the Connecticut shore, which always meant a stop off at Lenny and Joe’s for some fried fish. Lenny and Joe’s serves food in two sizes – huge and JESUS-MARY-AND-JOSEPH-THAT’S-A-LOTTA-SCROD. Which makes no sense considering their large sodas are the size of thimbles.  But I digress.  My friend loved his fried fish. More importantly, he loved his fried fish with a ton of French Fries. He would truck that food like a champ, and while my friends and I certainly weren’t shy when it came to scarfin’ some shrimp, he had us beaten hands down in terms of speed and efficiency. That platter didn’t stand a chance when he came to the plate.  The trick is, my friend had heartburn. Bad heartburn. Pathological heartburn. Water gave him heartburn. A warm summer breeze would give him heartburn. Heartburn so bad it would render him incapable of rational thought. One would think that such gastric disturbances would force him to be a little more discriminating with his eating habits, right?  Fuck no! This is America!  He would carry around with him at all times a jumbo bottle of Pepto-Bismol, the top-shelf stuff that they only let you take two or three times a day. He would sit down in front of his trough of fish, practically inhale it, and wait a few minutes until the heartburn hit. There he would be, writhing in pain, doubled over in front of his car and looking for all the world like he was about to projectile vomit into the ionosphere. But then, like some suburban Clint Eastwood, he would pull the Pepto bottle from his pocket like a Colt .45, pop off the top, and drink half the contents. One minute of pain, one massive burp, and bingo, no sweat, he was fine again – ready for another plate of fried fish.  I would ask him why he would do this to himself. Why purposefully overeat when he knew that his stomach would give him hell for it later? It was abusive. His answer?  “You can’t eat fried fish in small portions, dude.”  …  I submit that there is nothing so uniquely American as consuming more than your body can handle, for the simple fact that  you can .  I love this country.  P.S. – Don’t let anyone feed you bullshit about “Under God” being an essential part of the Pledge of Allegiance. That was added in the ‘50s as a response to international communism, when the U.S. was looking for ways to stand in opposition to the Red Tide. Why? Because the Communist state disavows organized religion. Therefore, to oppose the godless Commies, we started teaching our kids that our country had the blessing of God. Linking God to Democracy was nothing more that a subtle foreign policy maneuver.  I’m sure the Baby Jesus appreciated it.  -Mr. Carson

       “Hungry?” And Other Ridiculous Questions and Notions II: The Inebriation Proclaimation    Whiskey worship is freedom.   Alcohol is the only reason we wear clean underwear. It’s a reason to have a party. It’s bleach for your soul. It’s the sweet meat filling in the wanton of life. Alcohol equals warm genitals in an honest hand. It’s our sinning savior… the fluid priest that never denies us absolution. It’s WD-40 lubricating our ever-stiffening emotions and dissolving the rust from our eyes. We’re honest children when we drink. Booze is liquid innocence and anyone who says otherwise is a dirty Nazi. It is our father - warming us…feeding us… making us happy. It is our counselor, our loyal animal companion, our non-stick bandage. Alcohol is midnight sex in the barn loft. It’s a hand up Linda’s dress at the movies. It’s our filthy runny fantasies uncongealed and bottled for our pleasure. It is the womb of all that is dulcet and melodious.    Christ is Turkish Bourbon.   It is our interruption elixir. Pause, all that is melancholy. Halt, all that is pain… all that is doubt… is fear… is our undoing. Keep me knee deep in love potion. I’m tilting my life at a ninety degree angle. I’m getting the last drops. I’m swimming in a sea of infallibility and acceptance. I’m the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Alcohol is eternal love-making. It is our paradox… our un-dry epigram. We take shots to give shots. [scotch] down goes fear, [vodka] loneliness takes one in the chest, [bourbon, tequila] self-loathing takes two to the head. With our enemies slain, we rest easy. I settle and press into the warm bosom of my aqueous lover. We untie. We submerge.  To hell with you nay-saying sobriety mongers. You know nothing. My words are a solvent for injustice. My spicy little mind is a breeding ground for all that is perfunctory and off-handed. My ass is a tangy greeting card for your eyes only. I am a Japanese cannibal hell-bent on world domination. I am a veritable zoo of asymmetrical, preposterous, side-line thoughts. I meet with Hitler once a week to play bridge and I punch him in the face. I comb New England villages for cheap gin and lobster specials. I am free with purchase. I'm a raving wandering monkey with an endless supply of empty postulations and proclamations. In a sane world, I'd be a rock under your bridge. In a better world, someone would have taken the time to shoot me in the face by now. Thank God for American apathy and ignorance. Without you, I’d have reason to stay on my toes.  [Jagermeister]   I’ll never take my final bow…  [JD]  --Dexter Otis Green

        You cellular phone and you : Alil' bit o' venom for the morons    Listen. It’s time someone told you the truth.  Your cellular phone is useless. It’s almost always off or not on your person. Even when it’s on, you never answer it. Your cell phone is a status symbol… not a means of communication. You constantly fondle it in your pocket like some monstrous clitoris. You download a million different ring tones… all of them queer and all of them annoying as all hell that we get to hear each and every time you get a call.  Beethoven's 5th? - Pick up your goddamn phone. I hope you choke on your leather cases and your ever changing face plates. You screen your calls like you’re a goddamn celebrity. You’ll only answer your cell phone when you barely have service and you’re driving 90 at night in a blizzard with a car full of screaming children with the windows down. No one understands a word your saying. We call back but you don’t answer. You never answer. Ever.   Loser.   Your cell phone has hundreds of features - and for the most part you are clueless to their existence. It wouldn’t matter if you were aware of them because you wouldn’t use them anyway. Features are something to talk about when you wave your cell phone around like some grotesque detachable electronic gonad. You don’t store numbers. You don’t use the calendar. You have zero use for that goddamn camera, I can assure you. And, most annoying of all, you never check you goddamn voice mail. Ever. We leave you messages but you never check them. And even when you DO check them, you don’t call back. But you pay for these high-tech phones and max them out with all the neat-o shit because you just can live with yourself knowing that some other yuppie has one extra bell or whistle than you.   Asshole.   The worst, though, is that you’ll never go away. You keep encouraging us to call you on your “cell”  . You’ll keep losing it and ignoring calls and forgetting to add us to your precious phone books. You’ll keep waving that contemptible phallus around talking to some loser in your car at high speeds invariably risking the lives of those of us who could care less about your conversation. Who gives a fuck about your mom’s shitty new hairdo or the fact that Billy’s dead? Certainly not I. And neither subject is so important as to warrant you risking my life. Wait until you’re not operating 2.5 tons of complex machinery at high speeds to strike up a conversation with your “honey bear”.   Eyes on the road, dick.   I just wanted to get that off of my chest… to let you celloser phone users just how I feel about you. Return calls. That’s why we leave voice messages. Charge your goddamn phone and keep it with you for the love of Christ. And, by all means, Pick up your friggin’ phone. That’s why you have it.   Sweet Jesus,   --Dexter

       Wait a minute… this sounds like rock and/or roll…    	Nothing like turning on Mtv to watch some good old fashioned music videos…. Oh wait.  There's too many TV shows on Mtv to play videos anymore.  But that's been a problem since I was in high school… not to worry… VH1 still plays videos, right?  Son of a… they don't play videos either.  These aren't music channels anymore, they're lifestyle channels.  That's bullshit, my friends… pop music is a dark and evil force that I hate to the ends of the earth, and the worst part about it is… I hate myself for thinking this way.    	Why, you ask?  Simply put, I'm becoming my parents, just like they became theirs.  Let's preface this argument with a brief caveat.  Most new music is bad.  MOST… not all.  There are bands out there (Radiohead, I'm looking at you) that are really, terribly talented and are breaking new ground with music.  And even Radiohead started out as a one hit wonder to be on Mtv with 'Creep"  but they transcended pop and really made something of themselves.  Like the Beatles, the Stones and the Doors did.  They each had their seasons as pop heartthrobs, on covers of tiger beat magazine… and managed to bust past that for a general audience appeal.  And a timeless quality that lets youngins like me enjoy them.    	Now, you may think I'm sort of classic rock snob.  I assure you, 'm not, although it is my first love, and it's the kind of relationship you remember for all times.  I'm also a big fan of country… NOT contemporary country… Rap… OLD SCHOOL… gospel… NOT contemporary gospel… starting to see a pattern?  It seems like I'm stuck in the past, right?  Which is where I get the lingering guilt of being born a generation late.    	I can't help but wonder if there's some band out there that I'm simply not listening to because I'm biased against their style of music.  I mean, let's face it folks, in thirty years, they're gonna be playing nirvana and Tag-team back to back on the oldies station.  Our coming of age music will become softened, and acceptable, and OLD.  Old people hum Benny Goodman tunes now?  When we're them, we'll be humming the melody licks to "lose yourself" by Eminem (another notable exception in the world of modern music… a lyrical monster, and a true talent in this dark age.)  	But which bands are going to define the here and now?  Try as I might, I can't believe the likes of nickleback and uncle Kracker are gonna be in it for the long haul… then I remember that they're tomorrow's forgotten 45s.    	At least we have 90s retro to look forward to.  It takes 20 years for things to be cool again, these days… look at the 90s themselves… the first 70s stations had started popping up, dazed and confused was out… 20 years gone, and it was back.  70s shows started playing on nick at nite… the 70s had become history.  And now, at the dawn of the 21st century, the 80s are once again coming forth in all their glammed up, synthed out, coked up glory. I love the 80s on vh1, 80s lunch hours, 80s stars coming back to haunt us and run for governor… like a large karmic wheel.  	But let's pop in the WayBac machine for just a short time, and think about the eighties… they don't fit my retro chic formula.  The 80s were like the foul opposite of the 60s.  This logical disconnect annoys me, because my theories are like my children, or my favorite actions figures that I line up to fight Cobra commander (fuck yeah, GI Joe).  I don't like it when there are glaring inconsistencies, although they are present more often than not.  I just ignore them and hum a little song to myself.  SO I offer the theory of why the eighties and previous generations didn't do what the past 20 years have done… it's simple.  The 80s were the last original generation.  Ok, ok… the 70s kind of ripped off the 60s a little bit, but we'll forgive them that, right?  So the nineties and the aughts are all about remixing and sampling… what does that say about my theory for when the 2010s show up… it'll be 90s retro, which is in turn 70s retro… and that is why the Mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012… because the double retro loophole will tear a hole in the space time continuum.  And we'll all go through the black hole and end up on a nice abstract island floating somewhere in andromeda.  Lemme tell you, I'm looking forward to it, because I bet the Andromedans have a music channel that actually plays music videos.   --The Slater

      OK Kids... bout time we had a new writer here at the  Beer 'n' Porn  factory and booy have we got one hell of a scribbler on deck. I've been after this particular fella for about 8 months now and it's about damn time he agreed to add his scrawlings to our potlock blog. His name is The Slater.... dark poet and guitar player extrodinaire. How'd I get the slacker to post? I gave him a random topic and in 15 minutes he beats out this piece of work and, Sweet Jesus, it's a doosey. Keep your eyes open for more work from "The Slater". Meanwhile, enjoy this tidbit.  ----------------------   Where have all the gentleman farmers gone?   Ever find yourself wondering HOW cold Canada could really be in the winter?  No, no, I’m not going to defect to the Land of Loose Morals that lies to our north, despite its even-tempered laid-backedness and its free health care.  But the fact that some days I yearn for the clean streets and cold liquor of our canuck neighbors tells me that something’s wrong here in this country.  The American political process itself isn’t flawed, but I believe that the way in which it is being executed could stand for some reform.  It’s akin to using a supersoaker to shoot people with sulfuric acid; the squirt gun isn’t evil, it’s just the mind behind the trigger.  Tenscore and 14 years ago, give or take, our forefathers brought forth one hell of a constitution, which was rigid enough to uphold the law of the land, but flexible enough to be changed if need be.  And it was vague enough that people could dictate their own morality.  And Rights!  We get new rights all the time!  The right to vote, the right to drink, the right to turn on red, the right to writing articles like this one… Fab-u-tab-ulous.    A flexible law system in which all people are entitled to life, liberty, property, etcetera…  Sounds keen, huh?  But it doesn’t seem to pan out.  Mumia’s in jail next to Tommy Chong, and the thrice convicted rapist is released, only to stab, then rape another victim.  Right?  People convicted of sensational crimes get book deals, and I’m stuck here writing a damned BLOG!  Instead of justice, it seems like everything has gone terribly awry.    Wanna know why?  It’s easy.  Stupid people are to blame.  Now, that is a rather all-encompassing group, so I’ll narrow it down for some groups to talk about for the time being.    -Stupid people who run for office. It’s a well known fact that the people who should be running our country are out actually getting things done, which is why the nation doesn’t implode like an eldritch Las Vegas hotel.  So we’re left with a popularity contest amongst all those people who annoyed you in high school… the prom queens, hard drinking jocks, pretty boys, and the kid who thought he knew the answer so he raised his hand all the time, but it turned out he was wrong, so he probably just wanted to hear himself talk… I hate that kid.  Its nonsense smear campaigns featuring nonsense issues and nonsense platforms.  Whenever anyone vaguely interesting gets into the mix, he’s accused of stealing votes away from major party candidates and losing elections.  Fuck that shit!  It’s time the two parties in this country get an overhaul or a squirt from the aforementioned sulfuric acid gun.  No one I know is completely Republican or completely Democrat, so why the hell are we letting them run the place? Representative democracy?   -Stupid people that run companies. Corporations are waiting outside congress to pour money upon the folks that we… I guess we voted for, and it’s this money that makes laws and actions happen.  So forget writing to your congressman about how much you hate a certain law. Here’s what happens… imagine the folgers commercial gone horribly, horribly wrong.  *Shiny looking fellow in a suit – Good afternoon folks, We’ve replaced Senator Congressman’s sense of social ethics and responsibility to his constituents with hundred dollar bills, extravagant vacations, and whores… let’s see if he notices the difference!*    Hey… this sort of fantasy fulfillment took the social edge away from rap… and it seems like it’s done the same to the people who are leading us.  And unlike rappers, they don’t DO anything else except make laws for and look out for us.  To recap: we’re being run by a bunch of overpowered Student Council members who in turn are being run by the people who are in business to sell us things.  Could any good come from this?  -Stupid people who can’t think for themselves. Now, this covers just about everyone, myself included.  We can’t blame the ones we elected completely, right?   I mean, we let them play house in Washington and Hartford… and we see the things that are happening.  What do you do?  Play Xbox?  Change the channel when c-span is on, to block out the poison?  Daydream about exploiting the system?  Come on, I know we’ve all dreamed about lucrative lawsuits that would leave us independently wealthy and reasonably famous… at the very least you’ve bought a lottery ticket.  Come on, scratching at it with a fingernail or a quarter, waiting by the TV to see if your number has come up?  You don’t have to lie, but remember, it’s your own conscience.  We’ve grown jaded and apathetic because we see the political system as a thing we can’t change… but if you remember a couple of fellows who founded the country and wrote up a magic piece of paper that keeps us from a descent into chaos and anarchy… changing is exactly what we’re supposed to do.   The American political system isn’t flawed… we, as citizens, have forgotten our responsibility to keep the fellows in Washington honest. So you don’t like what you’re seeing?  Vote for someone else… convince others to do likewise.  *looks at drew*   Can I go back to sleep now?   --The Slater

       Kozak crosses over    December 8, 2003   Well that’s it, kids. I’m writing this two days after Kozak’s brush with death and, I gotta say. the kid did good. We put him through hell and he came out smiling on the other side… granted we had to carry the bastard to the other side but I think you get the picture. You’d’ve had to have been there to understand the extent of the magic that took place. However, I was a wise booze-hound and keep a diary on Kozak’s exploits. Granted, I was drinking at the time… the entire day and well into the next, in fact, so I can’t guarantee that this is 100% accurate. Look to Kozak and the other fellas for confirmation. Meanwhile, just take my word for it and… well follow the wobbling Kozak.   December 6, 2003    10:02 AM ... Jake wakes up   We throw open his door, jam a Santa hat down on his head, and hand him a beer. He doesn’t ask any questions which is probably the wisest decision of the day. He drinks his beer. We smile. It’s begun.    12:52 PM ... Jakes falls down   The cock-rocking duo Two Kings is in attendance and they perform “Untouchable Wang (the loneliest virgin)”. Kozak is tickled pink. Then the booze gets in him and things take a turn. Kozak, after [winning?/losing] a beer pong tournament and throwing back eleventy-million shots, falls on the couch banging the back of his head pretty hard against the edge of the counter. He goes fetal for about 2 min and then quickly gets back to drinking after he’s able to uncurl. I smile inside knowing what’s to come. Kozak starts to show signs that he’s no longer good to drive.    1:00 PM ... Jake has become a raving lunatic   At this point, Jake has begun declaring a number of things… none of which make any sene whatsoever. We generally ignore him and keep drinking. Jake follows suit with the drinking but continues to rant. I think he humped my leg at some point around this hour but I’m not exactly sure. I’m doing my best not to shove shots and booze down Kozak’s throat. The kid is doing a fine job of that without any help from me.    1:05 PM ... Jake falls off of a stationary couch   Sweet Jesus… and it’s more like he falls into a pile on the side of the couch laughing drunkenly to himself. I’ve never seen Jake this wasted and its… well… goddamn awesome. He’s smiling to himself on the floor, drool glistening at the corners of his mouth, eyes half closed, his body rocking gently with subtle drunken laughter. I’m pretty sure that he has no idea where he is or who we are. I know that he’s on the floor because he truly cannot stand. What’s more, I know that as soon as he has the strength, he’ll be up… and drinking. I’m immediately jealous and double my drinking rate. Take THAT Kozak.    1:08 PM ... Jake declares that his own mom his "Hot"...(what the fuck?)   This we really don’t understand. To be honest, Jake’s mom is attractive. But what the hell possessed the kid to come out with this madness? None of us know or care at that point. It’s almost like a car accident. Kozak has become a booze monster and we’re feeding the demon so’s that we can all be safe. At this point Kozak has ceased to make sense 90% of the time. Those of us who know better are proud of him.    1:09 PM ... Apparently Jake is unable to lay on the couch without holding on...(wow)   This pretty much explains itself. Kozak has become a series of heaps appearing and disappearing all over the apartment. We’re trying to think of a way to slow him down and we’re all drawing a blank. He begins pouring his own shots. We watch in semi-drunken horror and fascination. Kozak wields the vodka like some vile liquid sword. We give him plenty of space. Occasionally he talks but, at this point, it’s all garbled nonsense.    1:11 PM ... Kozak parents arrive with food unbeknownst to Kozak.... Jake shits his pants... then proceeds to hug everyone... over and over... and over... and over... ... and  over... (wow)   This was one of my favorite moments in the day. Earlier that week, we thought it would be awesome to have Jake’s parents over to see there son all wrecked and such. I called over to his house and asked his mom if they’d come over. She responded with an enthusiastic, “Sure! What do you want us to bring?”. This day, they walk in to find Jake in pile form. He’s managed to find a way to stay on the couch. I guess that’s good. He hears his mom’s voice and cringes/smiles. His parents come in to view the drunken wonder that is their son and the kid does not disappoint. He doesn’t really speak a version  of English that most mortals understand at this point. He’s been reduced to gesturing and hugging to show his affection and he does it with great fervor. The parents smile and sit back and watch. We bring them into the foreground by teaching them beer pong. Jake has disappeared.    1:54 PM ... Jake spews   Just as the Kozak parents were leaving, we find the kid. He’s vomiting… hardcore. We all cringe a bit, knowing that this is probably the end of the party. We take turns going in to check on and comfort the kid. He seems to have and endless supply of spew. We pray for his salvation.    2:08 PM ... Jake is still puking   Jen R. goes in to take pictures and Jake says "I can tell it's you by your laugh.... I hate you you stupid bitch!" Jen proceeds to take the picture like a tropper. I laugh my goddamn cock off. After picking up my cock, I use this opportunity to catch up on some drinking. Kozak continues to spew. I smile proudly at our work.     2:14 PM  Dry Heaves...   OK… this isn’t fun anymore. Granted, I’m not the one puking so I have very little to say on the matter. We continue to drink and continue to help him. I just want him to feel better so’s we can get more booze in him. Ironic, I know…    2:58 PM  puking... then passing out… thank Jesus   It’s all brown fun coming out of his mouth at this point. English is a second language. The kid isn’t all smiles and, after he stops heaving and chucking, we carry him into his room and he wraps himself in blankets and curls up like an oversized baby Jesus. Honestly, I hope he wakes up soon so that he can keep drinking with us. Mostly I hope he’s ok… I’m not a total ass clown….    8:00 PM  STILL passed out   What the hell? He’s still passed out and I’m trashed by now… feeling somewhat guilty that I’m at his party drinking beer and such that’s intended for him whilst he’s unconscious. Also feeling a bit cheated. I honestly didn’t think the kid would have passed out by the time he did but, then again, I had no idea that he was capable of drinking so goddamn much.    8:31 PM  Kozak finally awakes proclaiming "There are levels of survival which I am willing to accept!"   Rock duo  Two Kings  goes in to check on Kozak and he flips out proclaiming the above. Kozak gets out of bed and …well… things take a turn. Kozak wakes up with a “fuck that shit” attitude and starts drinking. A tear comes to my eye.     8:40 PM  Kozak continues drinking... He is then dubbed, the "Booze Phoenix"   Shortly thereafter, Keystone is dubbed his official drink (by whom I do not know) and he is subsequently named “Keystone Phoenix”. Kozak seems to care less about his title and more about his booze. He puts it away like a champ and we stay the hell out of his way.     9:18 PM  Kozak is doing shots... game on   Sweet Christ of life… what the hell is he doing? - Is that Jagermeister? 151?... Dobbs gets the idea to make Skittlebrau... My god… Kozak consumes. We pray.    10:10 PM  Power hour   Santenella has invited us all to a power hour. Kozak joins us. My chest swells with pride. We drink and drink. The power hour CD is, thankfully, all Christmas songs. The apartment has become a drunken chorus. I’ve rarely ever seen anything that happy. I look up and Kozak is gone…  . I keep drinking and finish off the power hour.     ??? PM  ???    After drinking all day, I’ve lost track of damn near everyone. Passing out on the couch, I’m hoping Kozak is ok. He was smiling last I saw so I’m good. I hope he enjoyed his birthday. I pass out.       So… here’s a side of Kozak you’ve likely never seen. I certainly haven’t. This kid became an unstoppable train. Hell… we didn’t go anywhere NEAR the strip club. Kozak, if you’re reading this, I love you, kid. To the rest of you kids, I hope this puts things into  perspective. Instant Message Kozak at Artic Cataclysm. Tell him things. Meanwhile, I’m headed off. During the writing of this article, I’ve put away 6 beers. Figured it was appropriate to be drinking. Take care.   ”All Hail The Wang”  -- Two Kings   Untouchable Wang   --Dexter Otis Green

       Hello, my name is…DEVIL’S ADVOCATE – 12/04/03   Thanksgiving in my mind was always the gateway to the wondrous holiday season, the time when the food was plentiful, the snow was bountiful and the school days were scarce. Sitting down at your plate of turkey, stuffing and potatoes meant that the blessed celebration had finally commenced; that it was now time to put thoughts of school, work or responsibility aside in favor of lavish meals, festive gatherings and an almost otherworldly level of procrastination, apathy and general relaxation. A 24-hour gorge-fest on turkey day, 48 hours of good old fashioned Christian gift-giving madness near Christmas, and then the grand finale, 36 hours of drunken Bacchanalia when the ball drops on Times Square. Sprinkle in a couple of weeks off of work, add in a few days spent doing nothing productive other than sledding and drinking hot chocolate, and you got yourself THE GREATEST TIME OF THE YEAR, buddy.    Nothing else comes close.   As important as Thanksgiving is to the overall enjoyment of the holiday season, I always treated it as the beginning, nothing more. Sure, I love turkey day as much as any other hard workin’, Commie-hatin’ American, but it never felt to me like the BIG DAY during the winter months. It was a day to spend time with family – no matter what you actually thought about them the other 364 days of the year – and to pig out on some good home cooking. But other than that, it was nothing more than the first big holiday of the season. The same held for New Years; not that I don’t love the madness of December 31, but it is the bookend on the holiday season, the last futile attempt to eat and drink and [insert favorite sin here] as much as possible before jobs/work/school came calling again.   The big holiday was the one in the middle, the one that required – no, DEMANDED – a week and a half of days off flanking it just out of respect. The one with all the songs, all the great TV specials, all the great decorations and desserts, and - oh yeah, that’s right – the little matter of a tie in with ONE OF THE BIGGEST RELIGIONS IN THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD.   The big one was always Christmas.  I never really thought about the reasons behind this – I’m not much of a Jesus Freak, so I can’t say Christmas is important to me from the “organized religion” standpoint – until I read the recent article penned on Beer N’ Porn by the esteemed Dexter Otis Green. Mr. Green wrote an excellent piece where he described why, in his opinion, Thanksgiving is the superior holiday, and why Christmas’s rampant consumerism makes the holiday not only subservient to turkey day in his mind, but dirty and flawed in its own right. A great point, certainly, but it bothered me; and now, a week and a few glasses of scotch later, I’ve come up with a response to the bah humbuggers of the world.  Christmas is not only the best holiday of the season, but in many ways it is the antithesis of Thanksgiving. Christmas, no matter what Target/Filenes/Best Buy et al. want you to think, is all about  giving , while Thanksgiving is all about having, consuming, and most importantly,  wasting .  Let me explain.  As much as the pious among us would wont to disagree, Christmas is no longer a religious holiday. Heck, it never really was one, anyway. Even the most devout Christians will tell you that the real important days for the clergy is the Easter season, which recounts the last days of Jesus Christ and the essential tenant of Christianity – that Jesus Christ died and was reborn again for the absolution of sins.  Christmas, on the other hand, is a minor religious holiday, and was conveniently aligned by the clergy to coincide with the more secular celebrations of the winter solstice, to make Christianity more accessible to the layman. When you take into consideration the cultural aspects of Christmas – Santa Claus, Christmas trees (which – surprise surprise! – are a Lutheran tradition), mistletoe and the like –you see that what we as a community consider to be uniquely Christmas is quite far away from the advent roots of the holiday.  Just because the holiday has moved away from its religious roots doesn’t mean it’s lost any deeper meaning, however. In actuality, it’s the accessibility of the holiday to individuals across religious and cultural lines that make it such an important worldwide celebration, not just in the United States. What has become the cornerstone of the celebration is the giving, of showing your love for your fellow man through gift-giving, good deeds and a little spare change in the Salvation Army can.  Of course, Target/Filenes/Best Buy MegaCorp loves the consumerist slant of the holiday season, which is why starting the Friday after turkey day we are inundated with advertisements telling us what, where, and how much to buy for our fellow man. Its enough to make even the most idealistic person slap their head in disgust and cry “STOP! I’ve had enough of this petty, materialistic holiday!” I must admit, I’ve felt the same way plenty of times, especially during those years when your heartfelt gifts to your friends and family are returned in kind by a generic “Happy Holidays!” postcard.   Perception, however, is never reality. The Great Private Sector in the Sky can try as hard as they can to saturate our minds with greed and avarice, but they’ll never succeed in destroying the true meaning of Christmas – namely, the only time of the year when everyone, from saint to sinner, martyr to murderer, is expected to put all pretense aside and  just be nice to each other, God Damn it .   Granted, it still seems that this spirit of giving still requires some measure of material wealth – after all, the ending of “A Christmas Carol” wouldn’t be half as touching if Scrooge was broke as a joke and unable to buy his way out of years of treating his fellow man like shit. But the important concept is not how much you can give, it’s giving more than you can that defines the true spirit of the holidays. Think about Bob Cratchit saving his meager earnings from Scrooge and blowing it on gifts for his kids and family, even when he himself didn’t have clothes that kept him warm during the year. More importantly, think about Scrooge’s nephew inviting him to Christmas dinner every year, even when Scrooge continues to ostracize him and his family. Every year it’s the same answer, yet every year he asks the same question. Why? Because Christmas is about forgiveness, and family, and being giving not only of your money, but of your heart as well.  Take time to think about the institution of Santa Claus, and you’ll see that even the great red icon of selfishness himself is at heart about the giving spirit of Christmas. Adults create the idea of Santa for their children, so that they can have something to understand and grasp before they are old enough to understand the true meanings behind the holidays. Why would we as a society perpetuate such a fairy tale that forces us to spend great amounts of time, effort and money on our children? Because we care, and because we want them to have the same magical experience of a Christmas morning brought to you by Claus and co. as we did growing up. And so we sacrifice, and save our bonuses and our pocket money, and spent it all on one grandiose morning where our sons and daughters can beam wild-eyed at a tree covered in presents. And the greatest sacrifice of all? We sign each gift “Santa,” not “Mom and Dad,” and for years the children play with toys they never suspect came from their loving parents.  That, my friend, is the spirit of Christmas.   Of course there will always be people who miss the point, who never grow up and who only care about the gifts that are theirs, but the spirit of Christmas lives on regardless, and thankfully, most of us still understand what makes this holiday so special.   Thanksgiving, on the other hand, is the most selfish and materialistic holiday I can think of.   Thanksgiving is the polar opposite of Christmas. Whereas Christmas is about caring for your fellow man, Thanksgiving is all about taking care of yourself. Whereas Christmas is about giving to those who are less fortunate, Thanksgiving is about celebrating what makes you fortunate over others. Whereas Christmas is about sacrifice, Thanksgiving is about gluttony and greed. Thanksgiving is the celebration of ourselves, our success and our possessions, and worst of all, it’s central function is to  waste .  Who can honestly say they make only enough food for Thanksgiving dinner to eat in one sitting? Hell no. Thanksgiving is all about cooking enough food to feed yourself ten times over. It’s about cooking a Turkey the size of Mothra just because you can, because you can afford it, because your local store sells it, because your country knows how to genetically engineer them that size, forever and ever, Amen. It’s about mountains of mashed potatoes, acres worth of corn, turnips and squash, and seas of gravy. It’s about ten trays of cheese and crackers before you even sit down to dinner. It’s about twelve different desserts with three types of coffee and four different types of milk with varying levels of fat because some people don’t like following up 30,000 calories of dead poultry with whole milk. It’s about consuming. And at the end of the day, when you find that you can’t possibly fit all the leftovers in your fridge, it’s about waste. It’s about throwing your Aunt’s three-bean casserole into the disposal because you know no one’s going to eat it.   How can this possibly represent a day of thanks?  Don’t get me wrong – Thanksgiving is a grand holiday, and in the hands of those who care, it can be a wonderful day of reflection and emotional connection. Unfortunately, for most it just ends up being a 12-hour Turkey and football fest, and I just can’t see how that is superior to the magic and joy of Christmas.  Some say Christmas wouldn’t be anything without the presents. What would Thanksgiving be without the turkey? Or the food? What a presumptuous holiday, one that celebrates the affluence of our society without care for the millions around the world who starve.  It’s not always easy to be thankful for what you don’t have, but it’s always easy to sacrifice yourself for the betterment of others.   Merry Christmas.  -Mr. Carson

       Random Rants and Raves   (Preface:  Note that this isn’t my normal me.  I just sat down and started typing.  This may not be really coherent or anything.  I was compelled to write so I wrote. Now I got homework to do and stuff like that, I hope I can finally fucking concentrate.) -- The Phoenix  I don’t get myself sometimes.  I caught myself staring up at the sky for like 5 minutes at the apartment.  I don’t know what I was looking for, nor if I was looking for anything.  School started this week, which is good.  One of my teachers didn’t even show up for our first class, way to make a good impression on the class.  I have one final this semester, and that’s it.  My boss is in my discussion group for an online class, should help to make that easier.  I get to be in a pool tournament in mid-April.  That fucking rocks.  I love pool, I got into it a little as a kid, and I guess that was one of my wishes for my 21st birthday: to find a new hobby.  Billiards turned into that, and it’s quickly becoming a passion for me. Like some people to guitar, or some people to professional football or baseball, my thing is pool.  Some people know Tom Brady, Derek Jeter, and Wayne Gretsky; I know Allison Fisher, Jeanette Lee, Mike Massey, and Andy Segal.  Better than video games right?  In case you haven’t figured this out yet, this isn’t going to be one of my normal posts, this is definitely more in line of stream of consciousness.  I got a lot on my mind, and I need a purge.  Iowa Caucuses ended with Kerry winning.  Yay, the Democrats are still fucked in November, although the President’s State of the Union Speech did little to help his own case.  I’d like to see it once where the President doesn’t get invited to the House to deliver his speech, and make him do it in the Oval Office where there aren’t 300 of his favorite cronies clapping every time he says something.  I pretty much think Bush alienated himself from most of the “alternative lifestyle” community.  I quoted that because I don’t think there is a normal lifestyle, because we’re all different, no matter what MTV, sitcoms, or Clothing stores like Abercrombie and Fitch tell us.  Now I am not going to keep pounding on the door that Mr. Carson has all but beat down and set on fire with his last post, because I think he basically gets to the root of it.   Just remember, next time you want to go live in Florida, think about how much half the nation hates you for fucking up the 2000 election, and the other half loves you for fucking up the election.  No hard feelings though. That’s the past.  Ok, I’m done with politics for now.  I caught myself staring at the sky tonight.  Don’t know why, clouds covered the sky, I couldn’t see any stars.  I’ve begun thinking about this whole school thing again.  Usually I would be one of the first to say that unless you get lucky, you need to go to college and get a degree to find a slice of happiness for yourself.  But what is that anyway?  Why is happiness going to school, getting a degree, getting tied down in a job you will probably hate, marry a man or woman that you may or may not truly love, have kids that are going to reject you when they become teenagers, retire when you’re 65, and then die without making your mark on the world?  Why aren’t there more mind blowing discoveries in life? Why are people complacent with just “doing their time” on earth?  Don’t they feel a need to do something great?  Who says that happiness is the size of my checkbook?  Why is it that friends I know who don’t have jobs, or didn’t go to college, or went to college and left are so much happier than I am?  I can’t just be sitting on my ass waiting for happiness to come knocking on my door, can I?  Things that should be truly beautiful in this world are often swept aside in the face of the high speed world that has become our daily lives.  We are owned by what we “own.”  I can’t go anywhere without knowing what time it is when 200 years ago the only time people knew were sunrise, sunset, and noon.  What the fuck is wrong with me?  Why does it matter that it is 10:24 PM on a Wednesday night when I typed this when a thousand miles away to the west it’s an hour behind?  Is time that important?  I read a book called “Flatland” three days ago.  It’s by Edwin A. Abbott.  I recommend it.  I hope you won’t have what happened to me and dream of dancing polygons that could kill you in your sleep, causing you to wake up and not get a good night’s rest before your first day of classes.  It puts things in perspective a little, that there is more than your petty existence and what you “know.”  You know shit, you know nothing, and that’s step one.  Hit rock bottom, why should we hold back our emotions at the time when we need them the most?  Are people with voices in their head the crazy ones, or are the people who hear nothing in their minds?  I think about that because my voices do.  It doesn’t make me insane, although some people would say I just imagined friends or something like that.  Imaginary friends are the best ones, they are never going to hurt you, you can tell them anything, and they are going to react the way you want them.  It’s easier than human friends.  Actually, friends of any sort: imagined, plant, rock, cat; they are much easier than human friends.  I said cats especially because I like cats, but you can substitute dog in there if you wish.  It makes no difference to me.  I like how no matter what, cats have very few facial expressions, and they’re always there when I need one.  I caught myself staring at the sky tonight.  Don’t have any clue why, I don’t know what I was looking for.  Why is it that the things you think will make you happy seem years away when the real stuff that would make you happy is right in front of your face?  I had a 6 hour long discussion at a pool table with one of my best friends and I found out one thing: The choices we make in life do not change who we inherently are.  I am overcritical much of the time.  I have cut my ties to emotions so finely that I can’t appreciate the finest works of art and beauty. Who says they are works of art anyway?  Some mythical muse saying from the heavens that this is art?  But I digress.  Emotion isn’t dead to me, but it is distant.  Correction, the good emotions are distant.  Things like love, happiness, joy, confidence, pride are all but a distant memory to me.  I could create something that would revolutionize the world and feel next to nothing but that it was another thing to do.  The negative emotions like fear, hate, and anger are right on the surface, boiling under my skin.  I can’t say whether or not the real me is the nice guy everyone says and truly believes I am, or some grotesque Mr. Hyde who’s just waiting to release himself?  I hope that my friends are right and that it’s just hard to deal with me sometimes and that deep in my core I am the guy that people like and like to be with.  Otherwise I’d have to be evil, and I don’t think I could deal with that.  Trust is another one of those.  If you are one of the scant few people in this universe that I actually trust, good for you.  The others?  It’s not that I don’t trust you, but you haven’t proven it yet. If you’re not sure, you probably are on the second, much longer list.  Be my friend for long enough and you see that I have my ups and downs.  And that I don’t trust either.  Things are going exceptionally well for me right now.  It’s eerie.  More and more often I dream reality into existence.  I’ve been hit with well over a dozen cases of déjà vu in the past month, from my dreams.  I dream it, it happens.  I don’t know how or why this happens, but to be honest it’s starting to scare me.  I don’t need to dream of someone getting killed and then find out one of my best friends died somehow.  I’d probably commit myself if that ever happened.  I think that if there is a Supreme Being, it has been trying to get in touch with me.  Every so often, when I get complacent, something happens in my life that is basically pointing the finger at me.  I thought I had everything I needed in life back in 2001, and that I am totally reliant on no one but myself.  Then I heard a sermon about how Self-Reliance is a dangerous crutch in Oakland, CA (I was there on a school trip.) It moved me so much that I broke down crying in the middle of the church, and I didn’t even feel embarrassed about it.    It comes back to self belief/self-confidence.  I believe in balance of everything. For all my ups there are downs.  I’m like Icarus, who is flying so high he forgets the Sun, only to have his wings melt and plunge to Earth and his inevitable demise.  I’m scared of getting so good that I’m going to get knocked down again, and this time I’m not getting up.  It’s like a 15 round Championship Bout with life, and every time that I get the upper hand, I get sucker punched and hit the canvas.  I’ve gotten up every time, but even the most stubborn of us have to give in sometime.  I hope that I can get out of the ring or KO life before it KOs me.   I caught myself staring at the sky tonight, there were no stars. It was rather bleak and dreary.  The stars remind me that as much crazy random thought causing my fingers to type this that it doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. We’re so concerned about our own lives that we don’t think about the grand scheme of things.  We came from nothing, then from stars, been blessed with the gift of life, to return to the stars, then to nothing when it’s our time.  In the end…  We’re just Star stuff.  I’m out.  -- The Phoenix

       On Same-Sex Marriage    “Article 1 of the Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, provides:  ‘All people are born free and equal and have certain natural, essential and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness. Equality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of sex, race, color, creed or national origin.’  This provision, even prior to its amendment, guaranteed to all people in the Commonwealth--equally—the enjoyment of rights that are deemed important or fundamental.  The withholding of relief from the plaintiffs, who wish to marry, and are otherwise eligible to marry, on the ground that the couples are of the same gender, constitutes a categorical restriction of a fundamental right. The restriction creates a straightforward case of discrimination that disqualifies an entire group of our citizens and their families from participation in an institution of paramount legal and social importance. This is impermissible under art. 1 .”[ EMPHASIS ADDED]  - Justice John M. Greaney, Massachusetts Supreme Court Justice, concurring statement from  Hillary GOODRIDGE & others vs. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH & another , November 18, 2003.   “Activist judges…have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives. On an issue of such great consequence, the people's voice must be heard. If judges insist on forcing their  arbitrary will  upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process. Our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage.”  [EMPHASIS ADDED]   - President George W. Bush, State of The Union Address, January 21, 2004  ---  I am pissed.  Strike that.  I’m  wicked pissed.   I am withholding my full-blown assault on the ridiculous buffoonery of the Bush administration for another time and another place. Instead, I am taking time out of my day here to unleash my righteous anger on the unquestionable idiocy of Bush’s hard-line stance against same-sex marriage, before that coke-snorting dumbass and his legion of religious right ditto-heads destroy this country that I care about so deeply.  That’s right, I said  destroy . If we allow Bush and his cronies to take this issue to a Constitutional amendment, we will have seriously weakened the strength of our Democracy, over perhaps the most insignificant social issue of the day.  Let me make this one point perfectly clear –  this has nothing at all to do with whether I or anyone else should believe same-sex marriage is morally agreeable . I personally believe two men have the same right to be married that two women, or a man and a woman do. Other people disagree. That’s their right. Beliefs, however, mean as much as a barrel full of donkey shit when it comes to the impartiality of the U.S. Constitution.  My father, a deeply religious man, believes you can boil down the Ten Commandments, the Beatitudes, and all the teachings of Jesus Christ into two basic rules – Love God, and Love your Neighbor. Everything else, he says, simply comes from those two basic rules. Get those right, and you’re doing alright in the eyes of the Almighty. I believe you can do the same with the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. All you need to know about American Democracy fits into one basic statement:  go ahead and do whatever you want as long as you don’t bother anyone else.  Incredibly simple, incredibly powerful and undeniably brilliant. All of the laws of the country stem from this basic idea, and all of the great social upheavals of our history (the abolition of slavery, civil rights, women’s rights, gay rights, etc) have been times where we, as a society, have matured and learned how to better apply that basic idea to our community. A majority of the modifications to the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, have been made with this principle in mind, and have served to strengthen our society. Those that have been added under false pretenses, such as the prohibition of alcohol, were quickly removed when it was clear that they served no purpose as part of the Constitution.  When the Supreme Court of Massachusetts ruled in favor of same-sex marriage last November, they did so because of the rules laid out in the Massachusetts constitution. Marriage according to the State is nothing more than a legal agreement, and pursuant to that agreement a license must be issued by the State to formally recognize the validity of such an agreement in the eyes of the government. Therefore, issues of who is and who is not able to marry come down to an issue of licensing, and as the Court ruled, there are no specific reasons why two people of the same sex can be refused a license based on the current legislative rules regarding the issuing of marriage licenses. Therefore, the refusal to recognize same-sex marriage in a secular context becomes a clear-cut case of discrimination, making it illegal according to  constitutional principles  to disallow couples of the same sex to obtain marriage licenses.  Now, because Massachusetts marriages must be recognized by the other 49 states, this becomes a national issue. It is clear that the same basic principles will hold when this case is presented to the Federal Supreme Court, and this is why the God-fearing religious right is so adamant about making a Constitutional amendment. The only way to guarantee that two men or two women cannot marry is to spell it out in ink on the Constitution – making it set in stone that same-sex marriages are not allowed.   This is by far the most asinine idea ever concocted, and it must be stopped at all costs.  Obviously, religious marriages can make any restrictions they so choose, because religious beliefs are protected by the Bill of Rights. Marriage, however, is recognized by the government through numerous tangible fiscal benefits, such as tax breaks and insurance coverage. Therefore, there is a secular component to marriage that is recognized by the state, and because of a little thing called the sep aration of church and state , secular marriages in this country  cannot  be restricted by the boundaries of minority beliefs. By proxy, this means that sex discrimination in the case of marriage licensing is patently unconstitutional, and same-sex marriages should be allowed.  Period.  I have some sad news for the Defense of Marriage people out there. Living in a Democracy means that sometimes you have to put up with people who do not share your own beliefs. As long as their practices do not infringe upon your basic rights, they can do whatever they want, whenever they damn well please. And no amount of incessant posturing or empty-headed rhetoric will disguise the fact that your personal life is not affected in the slightest by the personal lives of others. Your heterosexual marriage is strong or weak regardless of the homosexual marriage next door. More importantly, the government or its policies can never control your religious beliefs about the sanctity of marriage. Therefore, you have no choice but to sit down, shut up, and accept the fact that civil marriages can and must take place between same-sex individuals.  To even suggest that a Constitutional amendment is necessary to remedy this non-situation is an affront to everything this great country stands for. To put an amendment in that essentially says “you can do whatever you want as long as you’re not bothering anyone else, except for this one thing, which you can never do no matter what,” is not only indefensible, but dangerous to the stability of the Constitution.   I find it inconceivable that there are people in this country that are willing to fracture the pillars holding this great Democracy together just to tell two people who love each other they can never be joined in the eyes of society.  If you believe same-sex marriage is immoral, or a sin, that’s your opinion. If you believe it should be illegal, then  you are wrong . It’s that simple.  Never mind the benefits that would come from a society where same-sex marriages were legal, both for individuals and for society. Marriage allows people to consolidate their income, to receive beneficial tax breaks and insurance deals. This allows them to invest more money into purchases, into real estate and other venture capital pursuits, which improves the national economy. More importantly, same-sex marriages may serve as the perfect outlet for one of the greatest concerns in modern society. In 2001, over 290,000 children entered foster care. That’s over a quarter million American children without a stable family environement. Add in to this the number of children born into adoption each year, and that’s a staggering 400,000-plus children each year in need of a loving family. Who could possibly help out in raising these kids, providing them with a healthy living environment and a nuturing social structure?  News flash – gay marriages don’t often produce babies. It’s a biology thing – ask your parents.  Gay marriages represent a segment of the population that are willing to take on these foster children and raise them in a family structure. They cannot afford to do so without the tax breaks offered by legalized marriages, which as we have stated before are Constitutionally permissible. There are no justifiable reasons why gay individuals should not be allowed to marry. Except of course that whole God thing. But if you read the Constitution, you’ll realize that there’s a little thing called the separation of church and state that has something to say about your religious beliefs and their bearing on public policy.  Plus, to those who say raising a child in a same-sex marriage is unhealthy, I ask this. Why is it any better for a child to be raised by abusive or negleting parents, just because they are heterosexual?   Bush’s statements in the State of the Union address should put fear in all Americans, right and left wing, religious or atheist. We are not talking about the morality of homosexuality, nor are we talking about the role of marriage in society. We are talking about the sanctity of the U.S. Constitution, the document that has seen us through 228 years of hardships, one civil war and countless social upheavals. We are talking about the one code of laws that manages to keep this dumbass country from legislating itself out of existence.  Please, please, pretty please with sugar on top – don’t fuck with my Constitution.  --------  Oh yeah – don’t vote for Bush, either.  -Mr. Carson

       Late Night Ramble: on love, truth, beauty, and understanding   Well now… after sleeping off my hangovers, taking down those damned trees and lights, and marveling at Dick Clark’s seeming immortality, I’m ready to get back to work. Consider this my first official post of the new year.  ...I know… ‘bout damn time :)   The following is part one in a four part series that I’m gonna try and bang out in a week. I’m usually up well past a reasonable hour and oftentimes I’m alone in front of a monitor or a television or a novel or some such thing. Invariably, my mind gets to wandering and I find myself lost. Most times the night ends with me shaking my head and going to bed. This time, however, I’ve decided to share a bit of that with you bastards. This first part is my take on love. Don't go expecting this to make sense... this is me strained through twilight and beer. This is [Dexter] after the witching hour... this is my unedited madness... Hold on to your gonads…    Part I - Love    On Love   I  if when you cook gulash(sp?)    and i, bleary-eyed, 		     stare and stare        at the soft          Camera dollies in slowly rIse of your neck siLhouetted by the stOVE lamp         cUt to medium shot and PLEASE take delight in    directing my own little pLAY     chuckling WITHal       Would you chastize ME?  II  In November freeze swarms of autumn leaves crack against the windshield in head-light drunk glory,  So contagious their abandon that cortex and testes  travel time to remember when  I took shape! between lines of antimony  and fell  A lash to the cold.  III   I saw your face  Etched in mist By the branches  Outside my window. An equation crawled  across my wall and divided into the null set.   --  Ram S.Iyer    I fall in love all the time. Hard. There’s really no rhyme or reason to it either (and I suspect that would make it easier to deal with). No certain look, no melodious voice, no athletic prowess or intellectual whatnots have been able to truly catch my eye in the beginning. It’s always some oddball thing. They way they chew their food, the way they pronounce a certain word (cabbage – long story), hell even some annoying things have a way of capturing my heart wholly and without the slightest hint of reason.   That isn’t to say that it’s love at first sight. In my opinion “love at first sight” is dramatic romantic bullshit that only happens in movies and cheap novels.   Nevertheless, however long it takes, I’m eventually smitten without hope of recovery – or so it seems at the time. Having been captured I am, thus, their slave – unbeknownst to them, of course. I spend damn near every waking hour in a semi-conscious daze. I fret endlessly on how I would express this wonderful and altogether insane feeling. I write secret poems and love letters. I look for idiotic ways to signal them that I’m interested. Hell, I even write dumb little love songs to go with my poetry. It’s sad really.   Alright – maybe that last part was a bit dramatic– but follow me.  I don’t do well. I make a huge and wildly unpredictable ass of myself. I break easily. My confidence leaves me and every moment with that person (who before was simply another person) is bliss/agony. I friggin’ stutter if you can imagine that. I’m barely myself. It’s as if some great and terrible fire has been started and I’m simultaneously warming myself by it and being consumed by it. And, what’s more, if I’m particularly unlucky, I am brought to the point where I reveal my affections.    (Shaking head) – That’s right – I tell them. It’s horrible.  For all the confident assertions, manly showboating, and downright asshole-ery I’m known for, at the end of the day, I’m a softy. Love, quite literally, makes me sick.   I’ve spent the brunt of my years mulling over just what love is and how it works. My motive wasn’t as noble or innocent as you might suppose. I did (and do) all this searching because I wanted a cure – badly. I want off of this damn love rollercoaster.  My questing has basically lead me to these two truths:  1)	There’s not a damn thing I can do about it – falling in love I mean 2)	Love was never intended to make any kind of sense and any search for such a thing is hopeless  I used to be afraid to label my feelings as “ LOVE ” – that frightening four-letter word. I’d reason that I hadn’t known the person long enough or that any number of other factors weren’t “just right”… that way it couldn’t possibly be “love”… it was “like”… or infatuation, or a crush, or whatever. Anything but love. Love takes years and years of cultivation. It doesn’t just HAPPEN… right?!   Boy was I ever wrong . (I hope you heard that, Don)   I came to find that my feelings were love. Infant stages, mind you, but love nonetheless. Similar to the way a baby is just as much a human being as an old man though they are wildly dissimilar…  terrible analogy, I know but follow me. In much the same way, my feelings for these folk were born out of something. No spontaneous generation mumbo-jumbo here… That love that I felt (and feel), like all love I suppose, was mothered by past experience and fathered by stimulation – what happened before meeting them combined with meeting them. That love is then nurtured by trust (mother’s milk), truth, compromise,. Etc. etc… you get me. I’m not saying that every time I get a hardon, it’s time to go ring shopping. I AM saying that it was and is love and that it’s one hell of a mindfuck.  I still wonder why it happens like it does for me. Every time I go off spilling my guts and come back empty handed I say, “What the hell is my problem? I knew better from the start not to go off at the mouth about ‘love’ unless I was sure that the feeling was mutual. What in the hell was I thinking?”. I know I’m not alone on this one. We’re encouraged to seek out love, to never give up until we have it, and (most importantly), to never let go. We’re drawn this wonderful picture of what love is and we buy it and hang it on our wall and swoon. We curl close to our pillows and dream about it. I guess in someway every one of us is either waiting for it or trying to maintain it.   But why?   Why do we believe in this madness? And, what’s more, when we discover the truth… when we find out that  love is the cure  and  the disease … why do we continue? Is it really worth it?  Maybe so. Perhaps it’s the hope of love as the ultimate panacea that keeps us questing regardless of what we believe to be our chances of success. It’s one thing to hope against nothing or to hope for the unlikely. It’s an entirely different thing to hope and seek after something many of us would believe that we’ll never have… more so something that we believe that we aren’t worthy of. THAT’S the kicker. Love hurts, it is nearly impossible to obtain, and we are, by our own estimations, unworthy… yet we pursue it nonetheless. Because even though it may be hopeless and even though we may be unworthy and even though it may drive us insane when we find it… the good of it - the filling of the hole within us all so to speak… the death of loneliness - is far too compelling.  Or maybe that’s bullshit. Maybe it’s way past my bedtime and I’ve had too much (or too little) to drink. Maybe love isn’t any more important than football or bourbon.  Maybe.  I do believe, however, that love is something that starts from within. That love for another isn’t pure if one doesn’t love oneself. And I believe also that love is true in different ways for everyone.  So what’s my truth? – love burns. As well it should! What good would love be if it was easily found? and when lost, if it could be recovered from in a night? Where’s the value in that? What would be the point of a quest if you never left home, never left your comfort zone, never suffered, never fell flat on your face, or never lost faith? What good is it if there is no stuggle? No trial by fire? I’ll tell you. Zero good. No good at all. Because without the struggle, without the heartbreak and the hopelessness, there can be no appreciation. When you get burned, you bet your sweet as that you’ll remember. And the bonus is that with all that burning comes purification. Hear me out.  Self love is something we don’t spend time on. We aren’t motivated by any tangible prize or even anything that we see to be worth it. We figure, most of us, that someone else will show us the way to love ourselves. And sometimes that’s true. Sometimes someone else points us in the right directions… reminds us that we’re worth a damn. True or not, however, truly loving ourselves makes us pure. We’re less likely to do all the things that we do to impress others… to keep up this image that we’ve “perfected”. That’s where it’s at, man. Giving a shit about ourselves. Looking in the mirror and smiling back knowing all the merits and flaws of the person looking back at you… loving that person and living accordingly.   But we don’t. Instead, most of us spend time enumerating and focusing on our weaknesses as if they somehow make us unworthy. We come to fear and hide our flaws from ourselves and others rather than embracing and dealing with them. Then we get all bitter and jaded and we lash out at the ones around us. It’s pathetic really. I heard (or read) a while ago that goes something like this:   A grandson told of his anger at a schoolmate who had done him an injustice. Grandfather said: "Let me tell you a story." "I, too, have felt a great hate for those that have taken so much, with no sorrow for what they do. But, hate wears you down and does not hurt your enemy. It is like taking poison and wishing your enemy would die. I have struggled with these feelings many times. It is as if there are two wolves inside me: one is good and does no harm. He lives in harmony with all around him and does not take offense when no offense was intended. He will only fight when it is right to do so, and in the right way. But the other wolf is full of anger. The littlest thing will set him into a fit of temper. He fights with everyone, all the time, for no reason. He cannot think because his anger and hate are so great. It is hard to live with these two wolves inside me, for both of then try to dominate my spirit." The boy looked intently into his grandfather's eyes and asked, "Which one wins, Grandfather?" The grandfather solemnly replied, "The one I feed.”   I’m not one for quick-serve morality tales but this one stuck with me.  "The one I feed.”  Damn. Speaks for itself.  Love is a hand job in the back of a Chevy. Love is a hard-on in the middle of gym class. Love is a cashier popping bubblegum behind the register in a pink halter top with shiny black fingernails and a stud in her tongue. Love is soul searching. Love is truth minus rationale and logic. Love is a beer glass that’s never empty.  Somehow I feel like I’ve digressed… imagine that….  Love :::grumble::: I wish there were an easier way about it all. No… not even that… I wish there were some sort of sense or order to it, you know? Something to be sure of… something that could be counted on other than the fact that the only guarantee is that if you aren’t careful, you will most certainly get burned.   Most of all, I realize that, with all my ranting, it’s what I want. And it’s what you bastards want too. :::shaking head::: it’s a vain wish… that I should be able to ignore it…. it being love - my want for love, to be more specific.  I’m tired of movies lying to me… telling me it’s easy if only I can be clever enough to plot my way into the heart of the one I love… or stupid enough to fall ass-backwards into love… or rich enough to buy them… or pathetic enough that they can’t help giving in to my whining pussy tears.  I’m tired of music telling me that love is the end all be all… that’s it’s all we’ll ever need… that love is so easy! All you have to do is :::insert dance craze::: ! I’m tired of music making something that was meant to be an  internal  epic, an  external  epic.    Clue #1:  No matter what a song tells you, your lover will not die for you… or bring you the moon or any of that shit… ever.   Clue #2:  Love is NOT all you need   Clue #3:  Love is like taking a massive shit… sometimes you can’t help it and sometimes you can and, though it can get tough and tricky at times, it’s worth it in the end.  Love is the end of fear.  Love is war is hell is on earth is beautiful.  Love is finally getting some sleep.  ...  --  Dexter Otis Green

       Many times I hear people talking about how they have a friend that looks just like Eddie Murphy or Bob Costas or Shelia E or some crap like that. When I finally meet these people, they look only vaguely similar to the person they're supposedly a dead ringer for... like they're a black guy or they're short or play the drums. What a crock.   This kid, however, has stood every test known to man. Believe me when I say that, in everyway imaginable, he IS the comic book guy from The Simpsons. I defy anyone to say otherwise. The resemblance is such that I would believe that the charater is based on him.   It's amazing.    Beside that,  Eric "Dobber" Dobbs  (or King Dobbs... which no one calls him... ever... except like if we've been paid... or have been drinking... or accidently wander into his bondage dungeon... again...  ) is a decent fella. $1,000 to the man (or ... ...woman.... ) who can best this man in a Geography Bee. And you're main-lining some serious fucking H if you think that you can match wits with this kid in Classic/80's trivia. The kid has blown loads that reach farther than your supposed knowledge.  Bitch.  Anyway... He sent me this piece about baseball's Roger Clemens and I figured I'd toss it up here. This should more than pay for the dead whores his ma found in his trunk (sorry buddy.... waste not want not).  Enjoy...   --D.O.G.     And the Rocket takes off... Roger Clemens declared in October 2003, after the World Series, that he would retire. His statements to that point were that he would be a Yankee forever, and that he'd retire with the team that finally brought him his first World Series ring after a brilliant 15-plus year career. Just this week he announced that he was "un-retiring" and had signed with the Houston Astros a one year contract.Way to send out a message, Roger. We may be saying "Roger", but we are not hearing you loud and clear.   Now, as a New York Yankees fan, I feel a twinge of betrayal. Here was a man who would do anything to get into the pinstripes, to be a part of the vaunted "Yankee mystique", and who wanted to be a Yankee forever. His words apparently meant nothing. Of course, the Boston fans are privately gloating at the fact that the man who betrayed them by first demanding out of Boston and then 2 years later signing with the hated Yankees. It may be schadenfreude born out of 85 years of disappointment and the recent races between the two hated rivals that feel akin to the Punic Wars, where neither side is happy with victory unless it comes with the ability to utterly humiliate the other. Boston is now getting it's chance to sow salt in the Yankees' fields. But Roger's decision speaks to more. If Yankee mystique means nothing to loyalty anymore, then loyalty in the sports world is truly dead.   Being a Yankee is not something you chose, it is something that chooses you. There's a reason the Yankees are able to attract many of the best foreign players to sign contracts with them: They want to be Yankees, not just to play for them. You would do well not to excite the karmic backlash of turning on it. Yet Roger views the Pinstripes as mere clothing, to be discarded at one's own whim. Now, I'm not ignorant of the fact that Roger burnt every bridge out of Boston and Toronto in his rush to leave the two cities; in fact, I half-expected his decision to be more worthless than World Series tickets printed by the Devil Rays in mid-April. It is denying that being a Yankee ever meant anything to him that hurts. And now his time as a Yankee is done... he only played for us. But he is no Yankee. And if the Yankee mystique meant enough for him to want to be a Yankee, but not enough to stay one, then good effin' riddance. At least this time he picked a city that he was not likely to get booed in 36 times a year.   Furthermore, does it even count as retirement if you don't miss one game? That's another thing that's bugging me about this. Roger Clemens retired at the end of the 2003 season. Retirement usually has a connotation about it: that you're done, you're removing yourself from the stress of your occupation to pursue other goals. But now he's coming back. Dominik Hasek, goalie for the Buffalo Sabres and Detroit Red Wings, announced his retirement several years ago. But now he's back for another run. Michael Jordan has retired and come back so many times that I'm sure we'd never trust an announcement that he was dead until we had a chance to personally examine the body for 3 days. I can trace the retirement phenomenon back further than Jordan; Magic Johnson did it before Jordan, but his was to prove a point. He retired based on his announcement that he was HIV positive, and that he shouldn't put himself or others at risk. But he came back, to prove to us all that he was strong and could keep playing if he wanted to, a story of heroism. Mario Lemieux also did this, but for the same reasons: he was sidelined by Hodgkin's disease, and made a full recovery; he came back to hockey because he loved the game and he wanted to end his career on his own terms, not because he was forced to. But retiring used to mean something: it was bowing out gracefully when it was clear your skills are never gonna be the same (Wayne Gretzky, Cam Neely, and others); it was going out on top (Michael Jordan's first retirement, Ray Bourque), or when you cannot possibly continue as you are, wracked by injuries (Steve Young, Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth) and going out before you do severe permanent damage to your body. It was a moment of tremendous anguish if you were a team's superstar (Lou Gehrig's speech carries so much emotional punch even today), and a last moment of grace if you were merely good. Now, it barely means anything. It's almost become a bargaining chip (I'm convinced that Rocket's retirement in October was effectively a move to negotiate to the Astros, hoping to catch them in a point of desperation that they might lose the opportunity to gain possibly the best pitcher of the last 20 years).  Loyalty is dead. The meaning has been sucked out of retirement. What's next for sports fans? So proclaims the King, this the 23th day of January, the year 2004.   -- E. "King" Dobbs

       Stop Judging Me!  -or-  It's my Baby and I'll Eat what I want to.    Mr. Carson brought to our attention the seemingly disturbing poll results from our dear readers here at beer ‘n’ porn.  This poll does not, as it may seem at first glance, show a declining moral standard though.  Simply, what this poll so obviously brings to the forefront is the growing popularity of the culinary delight that is baby.  Once looked upon with horror and disgust baby is being seen more and more as an acceptable entrée appropriate for a variety of occasions.  Though frowned on in many circles the delicacy that is baby has begun to reach some level of acceptance in popular culture even being mentioned in as mainstream of a film as Austin Powers.  So, I applaud those who were not afraid to speak their minds and vote with their hearts on this crucial poll.  We should commend these brave souls for their honesty and conviction.

       Assholes Are People, Too   Recently I was at work at the Sunoco station, talking to one of the regulars as he was making his fourth coffee of the day, and conversation turned to one of the other regulars of the place, a somewhat taciturn man who was known for his quicksilver moods - personable and affable one moment, dour and grumpy the next. My fellow conversant smirked and said “Yeah, he’s an asshole,” as I discussed a recent episode. The conversation soon turned to different topics, but a thought that had sprung from his comment sat in my brain, and I thought about it later.  These days, I seem to be noticing that people are incredibly inclined to label people as “assholes,” “dickheads,” “fuckwads,” or any other of a multitude of descriptive terms for people who rub them the wrong way. No one comments on anyone in a positive light - they just mention the bad things they’ve perpetrated upon the innocent.   In the case of the temperamental regular customer, I happen to think he’s rather a nice guy. He can be a bit of a pain to deal with occasionally, but overall, I like the guy. It’s that way with a lot of other people I know, and I think that if other people really thought about it instead of being so quick to judge, they’d find that they feel similarly.   Remember, assholes are people, too.  Peace.    -- The Sasquatch

       Updation Nation – 1/9/03   Well, here we are, a week into the New Year, and I think we can all safely assume that this year is going to suck just as bad as we all thought. Rather than dwell on the uselessness of existence and the emptiness of the soul, let’s fill the empty void with some crass humor!  Here are the results of the most recent poll:  -----------------------------------------------------------------   BABIES?    5) MY PRIDE AND JOY –  1 vote (2%)   4) PERFECT AGE FOR DATIN’ –  6 votes (14%)   2 (tie) SHOULDA AIMED FOR THE BUNG –  8 votes (19%)   2 (tie) SORRY, WRONG NUMBER –  8 votes (19%)   And, the number one response:  1) SERVED WITH RED WINE –  19 votes (45%)   ---------------------------------------------------------------  In a landside, our faithful Beer ‘n’ Porn readers have determined that the proper response to the question of Babies is to serve them in the best Julia Child fashion. This simply confirms my suspicion that the majority of our fans are rabid cannibals with condemned souls. This affects my ability to sleep at night.  The second greatest population of readers, however, is not that much better. It appears that we have a contingent of deadbeat dads in our target audience – or at least people who enjoy a little assplay with their nookie. Far be it from me to pass judgements on your sexual desires; at least you’re not eating ‘em like most of our readers!  Although, the six of you who voted for #4 – shame! The authors of Beer ‘n’ Porn would like to go on record explicitly stating that we are appalled at the suggestion that newborns are available for romantic relationships. As McGruff the Crime Dog used to say, “Take a bite out of jailbait!” …Or crime, something like that.   Finally, to the one person who voted for the wholesome all-American answer: who are you? What the hell are you doing reading the perversion that is Beer ‘N’ Porn? I WILL NOT HAVE FAMILY VALUES POLLUTING THIS SITE! Fess up now, and your punishment will be quick and painless.

       Diversions to make much of time    We're the original vatos loco.  Smart.  Proud.  With no respect for control and no concept of being out of it.  We wave our mental pricks at full attention, seal synapses with words we don't apologize for, and fuck like we're immortals.  Wave after wave crashing on soppy sand.  I smell fish...fish frying in the deep woks of the snack stand.  The church bells toll on Annai Vellankanni church.  The temple three blocks away replies with Vedic chants.  People-bees everywhere humming out everyday life.  The honeycomb is just big enough to hold their dreams and themselves along with them.  It’s also wrought with hate of honey.  All these lonely lives.  I'm 13.  My friends are 13 and 14 a piece.  We are on our Hercules MTBs, trying to impress the college chicks who walk the boardwalk in the evening.  This beach, it is where we all meet.  My friends and I that is.  Deepak and Venkat and Roshan and oh so many other faces that came and went in my life in what seem now a matter of hours.  The college chicks don't notice us.  They have bigger fish to fry.  Just like the snack stands.  Oh the innocence of it all. And the bike races.  Breakneck proceedings involving heedless, thoughtless speed fix, really. Many cuts and bruises, who cares?  The college chicks looked.  Here comes the bus. Shit, am I going to make it?  Fuck....ta-dap te-dum taa-daa.  And when she showed up...man.  Those were the nights I jerked off in bed.  I think my parents knew; how couldn’t they – we shared the same floorspace at night.  We all loved her really.  But like the rest she came and she went too.  Only difference is she's gone forever.  Shit she should be so lucky.  And then there was this other one.  She actually held my hand.  Wooohooo.  Pavan shows up.  Blockhead.  Late as always, and clueless to boot. He was failing seventh grade.  For the third time.  Didn’t help his parents were filthy rich and his sister had cerebral palsy.  So between making money and spending it on doctors, Pavan will fade away to a sepia toned photograph in nobody’s attic.  If for anyone in my life I have felt pity, it would be for him.  The boy had a heart of gold.  My father doesn't like failure. I don't care much for it either.  I don't think anybody does.  We flew kites.  We flew kites because we couldn't soar.  Physics class succeeded in rooting our sense of bouyancy right out.  But man.  Learning was PHUN then.  I could have taken on the whole world, let alone the reporter from The Hindu who published my science project for the science fair.  Yeah.  I was considered top of the top, cream of the crop material, ladies and gentlemen.  Life is on loop.  Mine's walking the line.  I think I'll go to breakfast now.  Validation for one's self does not lie in the external world.  Heart surgery is not the key to a well balanced diet.  In fact, a well balanced diet is not a key in and of itself.  Just a by-product of the social diatetics dynamo.  Food isn't the greatest for self-esteem.  Sex does not lead to nirvana nor does belief in god.  In fact, exercising either credo leads to nothing but brainwashed heads, veneral disease, and dead ends.  Hypocrisy is a way of life that must be respected and evaluated as a very real, colourful critical theory to be applied to the American dream.  Bush is an expedient, let him go, let him go.  We are the flawed perpetrators of democracy. So we are to blame, directly and indirectly, for everything that happens to and around us.  As I unfolds Lids lift.  -- Ram Subramanian Iyer

        Twenty Something and Loving it?    Where do I fit in?  I'm not sure that I know at this point in my life.  I am 25 years old, working full time, attempting to get back to school so that I can really start my career and my life.  Friends are beginning to get married and start families.  We are all getting older and dealing with what that means for us as a group and as individuals.    Living at Home is Fun   While I really shouldn't complain, I need to get out.  I am not restricted in anyway really.  And, I could move out.  I'm not the only one of my friends still mooching off my parents.  Many of them are to one extent or the other.  I don't feel, therefore, that I am falling behind.  Sometimes I just want to feel all grown up and on my own.    College Woes   I do not have a college degree.  I am about halfway there and am planning on beginning classes again in the fall.  My problem is that I haven't taken a class in almost six years.  To be honest, I'm scared.  Everyone tells me it's easier after you've taken time off.  You work harder.  You understand what's out there a little more, and often times that means you know just how necessary a degree can be to survive in the workforce.  There is no reason to believe that I won't do well.  I did fine before.  Nerves and paranoia rule my life.    The Job from Hell   I hate my job.  That is my biggest complaint.  I work in a job with no appreciation, no room for real advancement, and most importantly no fun.  It is no fun at all.  I know that I won't be there forever and that is very good.  I also know that I could get another job.  I won't get into why I stay here, but if all goes well I will be gone when I start school at the latest so that helps.      What Does it all Mean then?   What then was my purpose in writing this and presenting it all to you?  I don't really know.  I'm just venting.  Life has not gone completely as planned.  That's true for most of us though.  I just feel that there are a lot of people in my age range that are not quite where they thought they would be by now.  Are you?  Jeffrey “---“ Motola

       I found this article dating back to 1999 in my rant archives tonight. Man, I tried to get this printed a least 1,000 times and the Daily Campus (the University of Connecticut "newspaper") refused to print it due to their obvious lack of enlightenment and journallistic integrity.  bastards...  It occured to me today that this can finally be in print. What with our readership now in the (???,???), I'm sure SOMEONE will be able to appreciate my biting yet underdeveloped brand of satire (You hear that, Amy Miller? - SATIRE!).  Oh, and to the  NFA  lads and lassies (Norwich Free Academy: Land of Marching Jailbait... Ok, honestly, I really have nothing terrible to say about Norwich Free Academy. They're a bunch of stellar kids, I'm sure... except for Tavis... When I say "wrong hole" I mean just that... bastard ::: tears :::) reading this trite outdated garbage, good for you! I pray that you are able to pass over the torture that is the U of C. If not then consider this fair warning. You're in a culinary paradise, my friends. UConn food is nothing but laxitive in 43 flavors.  Why am I posting this after all this time?  ...2 reasons  1) It's about damn time  2) Why the hell not? - I'm tired and George Killian told me to... so there...  This is a story told by me at 19... a year after discovering the horror that is  UConn Meat .   (P.S. Ladies, I'm 24 now and not afraid of jailbait... who wants a moustache ride!... ... by which I mean keep your creepy oh so fertile coochy-cooch to yourself... oh and women aren't people ::: ZING !:::)  Read on if you dare....      “Uconn Meat” vs. D.P. Dough – The battle rages on           (Beware the cows!)   ( Dexter @ 19 )  Once upon the time in the real world, I used to enjoy eating.  I loved foods like hotdogs, cookies, pasta and macaroni and cheese, bacon and eggs, steak…  That did not last for very long.  My first semester here at Uconn after a couple of weeks of dining hall food, I thought to myself, “Ya know, it’s really not that bad.  I could always go home every now and again and get a decent meal. By the time I really get sick of it, the year will be over and I can go home.” Soon that turned into, “Man what’s that smell?” to “I think I’m blind”, and finally, “Dear GOD….  My bowels!! They’ve come to life!! Can a real crop of fructose ever inhale choice iodine?  Perchance to steal a ligament of time?”  I have had some pretty nasty food in my short life.  Nothing compares, however, to the relentless ferocity of what I now call “UCONN meat”; the stomach churning, face distorting, mind warping concoctions heated (if we’re lucky) and served to us all. Call me picky but all I want is something that tastes half-decent.  To be honest, I’m only slightly concerned about how nutritious it is.  Day after day chunks of “bar-b-q this” and “teriyaki that” are shoved in students faces and the bad news is, it’s not getting any better.  Today it’s questionable macaroni and cheese; tomorrow it’ll be hot nameless bar-b-q flavored grayish slop (only 2% rat excrement!).  What are we to do?  I suggest either getting to know your friendly grocer or numbing your lips and tongue with ambesol before every meal.   	The real question is… what are we eating!!  Seriously!  I doubt that anything that taste like reheated teriyaki/bar-b-q rice crispy mystery beast could be 100% natural.  I’m betting 2% all natural at the most.  So, where does it come from?  Why is it here?  After much thinking and some help from an unexpected “vision” (note: don’t drink the water from mirror lake.  If, by some chance you do, tell He Who Learns in Timple Shinders that I shall never return…NEVER!)  I’ve come up with a few theories.   A. 	UCONN has a deal with a covert radiation experiment facility in which mutated animals are exchanged for student financial aid records and tickets to men’s basketball games. Then, after being forced to endure hours of tortuous dancing for unnamed UCONN faculty, they are promptly forced through one of several doors for “reconditioning and processing”; a secret process known only to very privileged staff of dining services.  The end result is served to us (give or take a vat of cheese, lard, and moose testicles) under the guise of one of three meats: chicken, pork, or “mystery beast”.   B. 	I’m almost positive it has something to do with an unseen Phyllis Dillar/Backstreet Boys connection.  It’s clear that something is definitely not kosher in that area but I’m not sure what it is exactly.   C. 	It’s all about the mystery beast. Need I say more?  I didn’t think so.   Ok, so the food sucks. “We have no other convenient alternative!” you say? Nay, I say, and nay again!! My beer-guzzling chums, there is an answer—D.P. Dough!! God gift to UCONN! With millions (or about 40) different varieties of calzone, one could conceivably eat D.P. Dough everyday for life… or about a month… which ever comes first. I personally stand by the Bar-b-q steak and cheese. The bar-b-q sauce in it is meant to trick my body into believing that UCONN meat is still present in my system. Otherwise, I’d go into withdrawal and devour my own body up to the waist. I’ve seen it happen. It’s not pretty.  I’d like to take this time out to thank D.P. Dough for their miracle concoction. Without it, I would surely perish… or just be really sad.             A friend of mine once told me that everything we ever wanted to know, we could learn by simply “looking to the cows.”  He was shortly thereafter committed to the Silicone Valley Mental Institution for organizing gerbils and Dan Quayle to create the perfect Andrew “Dice” Clay/Martha Stewart hybrid in an attempt to overthrow the government with covert communist tactics.  I never spoke to him again.  However, he did have a point.  The cows are not always what they seem.    Good? Bad? I don't really care - it's finally posted and I can go on composing drivel. Hope you enjoyed it. Keep your eyes and ears open for  Beer n Porn Radio ....  ...coming soon   Meanwhile, get the word out! - Our readership is growing but we can still use your help. Spread the word... tell your creepy D & D friends to check us out in between their bizarro Anime Porn JO sessions (you poor lonely bastards). And hey, got a topic? Something you want to hear about? Email me at DexterAML@yahoo.com with your idea. Make the subject Beer n Porn or Christ help me I'll delete it. I get more than starving Hatians.  Toodles,    -- Dexter Otis Green

       Confessions of an Unrepentant Alumnus, or How I Tried to Get My Degree Revoked Through Blogging    I just found my diploma while sifting through some random boxes of personal papers in my closet. It’s framed in a Wal-Mart plastic frame, because I didn’t really want to invest in the solid brass medallion and gold leaf trim and stupid amounts of money they ask for such things. It’s sort of strange and terrible that they nickel and dime you on the way out of college… graduation gown this, yearbook that, ‘memories that will last forever,’ et cetera.   The truth is, I didn’t even walk for graduation. My parents were disappointed what with my being the first member of my family to be granted a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution, but here’s how I tricked them; my sister (who is much better at school than I am) was accepting an award for academic superiority at Jorgensen auditorium, and there was a keynote speaker. And he droned on about how great sports were, and other school spirity things. I leaned over to my mom and dad, and whispered in a really loud whisper voice, “This is what graduation is going to be like, only MORE boring.” And thus, I was able to watch cartoons in my underpants while my fellow students stood up in unison, and wore all black, tossing their mortarboards into the sky of an uncertain future.  Why didn’t I walk? There are a lot of reasons, but I think the biggest one was I didn’t really want to be a part of the pomp and circumstance capstoning a four year odyssey of terrible bullshit. This is not to say I learned nothing in college; I got a fairly good grip on delivery phone numbers, and I figured out how long it took to get to my classes from my dorm, so to optimize sleeping. I learned how to fake a mean F chord. And, you know, whatever… some good ‘dealing with people’ skills or something, although I think my summer job at a Scout camp really sharpened those and made me the witty bastard I am today.   Now, I’m not one of the illiterati. I love learning. There were some times in college, while in the depths of some lengthy paper I’d put off until about 12 hours before it was due, where I remembered exactly how much I loved learning. It’s a shame it didn’t happen more often… and this is part of the reason why I think higher education is so fucked up. How can an institute ‘dedicated’ to the enlightenment and enrichment of young minds be such a hotbed of apathy and destructive behavior?  College is populated by a pretty substantial demographic of kids who don’t really want to be there. Well, they DO want to be there, for the keggers and promiscuity. It tends to be worse at pricier, private colleges, where it’s a bunch of rich kids waving their gold plated dicks around. I’ve seen it. And it’s disgusting. Bunch of lazy, shiftless, empty people waiting to be kicked out for hitting the bong six too many times a day.  Not that good students are any better. Fuck those squares, says I! I would have studied harder if I wasn’t afraid of becoming one of them. I mean, think about it… what’s worse than lazy people in college? Study dorks! Locking themselves in their rooms, avoiding the light of day, looking down their noses at people sunning themselves in the quad and playing wiffle ball. I mean, at least the lazy folks try to make the best out of a bad thing. Study, study, study, get a diploma, get a good job… do more work. These people are setting themselves up for juicy heart attacks.   The Studious make me even sadder for our future than the shiftless and unambitious. Here’s why… think about studying for a test. What do you do? Cram as much knowledge into your head as possible, and take the test, and do well on it. And you promptly forget everything you learn. I defy any college student to tell me what they learned about three semesters ago. This excludes fundamentals courses… but even those are forgotten, especially the stuff you don’t use in your advanced classes. And as for college graduates, everything fades once you embark into the dim, hazy world of corporate America. Even if you use your degree in your job, you still don’t remember all those elective classes that were supposed to round you out as a person. Voyage of the beagle wha? History of South Africa who? Introduction to archaeology huh?    The sad truth is, colleges make it okay to practice academic bulimia, binging on sweet fatty knowledge and puking it up on a blue book or bubble sheet, only to make room for economics or art history. They encourage this mediocrity, stuffing syllabi so full of crap that no one could know the breadth of it without a frenzied bout of studying for weeks before midterms. But wait, let’s make all the tests occur within a week and a half of each other, to make people study even more frantically, and lose even more of it! Now, there is cursory analysis in some of the tests, but nothing really profound, and nothing original. Compare and contrast the work of Cicero and Virgil with special consideration for the concept of character assassination. And blah blah blah. These ‘analytical’ essays are basically arguments the professor made in class, so you are in fact just regurgitating more crap. Dance, student DANCE! Dance around like a little puppet and bend over like a bitch! If you can’t binge orally, we’ll have to administer your education anally.   And we PAY for this!  So this academic Ebola perpetuates itself, festering in the fabled ‘test libraries of fraternities’ and 3x5s full of stat formulae. We lose the cards, we pass or fail tests, we go through the motions. And everyone’s ok with it. As long as the letter you get at the end of a semester is nearer the beginning of the alphabet, game on! It’s ALL about the bottom line. And for those of you studious folks who say ‘go fuck yourself, Scott, I learn plenty and I love what I’m learning and it’s not just about the grade…’ well, I dare you to audit a semester worth of courses and receive no grade for them whatsoever. You won’t do it. Because the grade is too damn important… grade point averages! Oh, no, I need a good GPA! If I don’t I’ll become a homeless person!! People kill themselves just to get a high number on their transcripts. I remember another set of numbers that were terribly important to everyone a few years back… SAT scores. Haven’t thought about THOSE in a while, have you? It’s the same with these letters and numbers. Your percentile isn’t worth a damn once you’re above and beyond this strange transitory period. After your first couple jobs, no one will even care. There will be new numbers to fret about. Now, children, repeat after me… Quotas… Quarterly Reviews… four oh one Kays.  I remember my dad once said to me, ‘College proves to employers that you’re trainable.’ And I said to myself, that’s cool then… this was when I was much younger. So I expected to learn how to learn, you know? But that’s the opposite of what happens. What I learned was if you give the professor what he or she wants, you will pass the class. It’s just a matter of figuring out what they want and giving it to them. So the content is not as important as the delivery of said content. So every semester, you had to start from scratch, unless you already had the prof, and then you just did well from the get go. That’s the secret to getting good grades… you don’t have to learn anything, you simply need to feign competence.   But why does this happen? Why would we pay so much money to these institutions, entrusting them with our education? Because the colleges feign competence as well. Job placement statistics, percentages of valedictorians attending classes, et cetera. They give us and our parents what we want to hear in our senior year of high school. ‘We have a good program that will get you a good job.’ And we believe them, and for the most part it works. People go on to lead productive lives and contribute positively to society, working just hard enough to get raises, marrying the college sweetheart, making 2.5 kiddies, which you will of course send to college. It’s a perpetual motion machine that makes the world turn, fueled by emptiness and mediocrity.   Most of what I value as far as my education goes is what I taught myself, by reading books that were on no syllabus, save the one in my head. I read, I interpreted, I grew as a result. I never needed to prove this acquisition of knowledge to anyone but me. it’s a lifelong process… I continue to read things that change my mind, and I enjoy learning immensely, because the knowledge is acquired on my own terms. I’ve read many philosophy books, despite having escaped college without a single philosophy credit under my belt. I like to understand them without the bias of an ‘expert,’ who taints the material with his own agendas. I’ve read almost every holy book, and integrated teachings and morality from each into my own personal code of conduct. All this, having never benefited from a single theology course. These things, I think, are best leaned in the confines of one’s own mind, sitting quietly with a cup of hot tea, without the stress of highlighting and writing in margins because of a ‘big test.’ I don’t need tests to keep me honest about what I learn.  So after I looked at my bachelor of arts degree (lovingly laser printed and embossed with the seal of our great state), I put it back, shitty frame and all, into the box with the other things I don’t need to validate my existence. I don’t need a piece of paper to prove anything to anybody. The proof, as Temple grad Bill Cosby was rumored to have said, is in the pudding. So the next time you can’t read a book because you are too busy with classes (I have heard this excuse, and I almost threw up with disgust), think about what you’re really being taught in the ivory tower, and why you’re eating the sweet lotuses that are making you content with forgetting things after you’ve proven you know them. You’re better off listening to meaningful songs and learning secret truths between the lines of wise dead folks and breakfast cereal jingles. When you are beholden to no one, there is no failure… only steps toward the truth.   Educate yourself; it is an infinitely more satisfying path.  -- The Slater

       Friends   What is a friend? 1.	A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.  2.	A person whom one knows; an acquaintance.   There are of course different types of friends.  There are those who we know, like, and trust.  There are also those who we simply know.  In order to have a discussion on the merits of friendship, or the lack merits, we must differentiate between the two.  We cannot expect tremendous compassion, and support from all of our friends.  There are many people with very large amounts of acquaintances.  We cannot expect our more casual friends to bend over backwards for us.  While I think that we all know this and do not expect this much we must first be clear that most of our friends will never fill any supportive role.  We should however be able to expect compassion and support from a select few.  For many there is only one person that ever fills this role.  Our best friends should be people that we can count on.  We should be able to call them no matter what time.  Don’t however expect that if you call someone at 5 am they will be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.  Also, calling someone at a ridiculous time of the night/day should be reserved for emergencies only.     “After High School [my friends] pretty much vanished”   First of all let me say that this happened to me as well.  The people I was close with in High School I am not close with at all now.  I do have friends from high school, but the people I spend time with now I did not then.  Or at least not as much time.  My closest friendships are those that developed during my late teens and early twenties.  As people go off to school, work, military, or whatever connections are lost.  People drift apart and it’s not usually just one side’s fault.   Should friends be anything more than people you enjoy spending time with?”   My answer is no.  You are very right Mr. Green.  But, I must say that there can be more to a friendship.  Don’t expect your friends to make you into anything.  I agree with you on that.  There are people out there who can be trusted, and counted on.  It’s a two way street though.  If a relationship isn’t developed on both sides then no one is really to blame.  Let me use myself as an example.  Not that many people know me too well.  Not really at least.  I don’t let people in.  Therefore, most of the friends I have are not that close.  That’s ok, and it’s my fault.  They are people I enjoy spending time with.  I have a few people that I can open up to and really talk to and be comfortable with.  People that I trust.  Including you Mr. Green.  Just remember that there is no magic safety net.  No, one is perfect.  That doesn’t mean, though, that putting trust in anyone but yourself is bound to get you hurt.  There is risk involved in any relationship in which you open yourself emotionally.  There are no guarantees in life.  Being unwilling to trust people though is no way to live.  Your friends are not liars…  You can trust me on this one - I’m one of your friends.  Jeffrey "---" Motola

       What are friends for?    Friend, how camest thou in hither? -- Matt. 22:12  America was first visited by Friends in 1656. -- T. Chase  Want gives to know the flatterer from the friend. -- Dryden     This may not be the best time to write this. Heh – I mean there’s never really a right time for anything it seems but… well there are so many things I don’t know… a number of things I haven’t gotten my hands on or been able to wrap my mind around. Unresolved conflicts, rushed resolutions, and flat out closed mindedness on my part are sure to lend more than a fair share of bias to this piece. I can’t imagine, though, that I’ll ever be seated in the right place to get this down properly. In fact, now that I think about it, this may very well be the best time to write this.  Who am I kidding…  Regardless of the timing, I’ll get on with it. For now, this feels important. Not to mention the fact that ideas like this lend themselves to wordy essays and like responses.  (pause… Continue)   I’ve never really had much trouble making friends. In elementary school, I was a bit of a weirdo being that I was one of 5.8 black kids in my school and… well… I was an odd duck beside that. Kids gravitated towards me and I had friends no matter how strangely I behaved. By the time I was in high school, my friends spanned the forever-wide gap between lowly geek and mountain top jock. I fit everywhere. I was invited to parties because I could make people laugh. I could sit damn near anywhere in the lunch room… even if I didn’t know the people – hell in 5 min, I could make a friend out of almost anyone. I was almost always the first one to talk to the shy new kid. I was the guy that defended the nerds. I was the kid that stared down the meatheads and made them take back their band insults. I was the kid that showed that jocks have personality beyond their jersey numbers and school records.   Now I was by no means a hero or a perfect kid. In fact, I was a bit of an asshole. At the same time that I’d stand up for anyone, lunch ladies included, I’d just as easily tear them down. It really depended on my mood to be honest. There were only a few people (this included you, Josh) who meant much of anything to me in the long run. I’m looking back now and realizing that most of my friends were social white noise. They helped me ignore how awkward and insecure I was. I didn’t count on them for much of anything but to show up to school. And, like I said, there were a few who were worth a damn but, after high school, they pretty much vanished and I was left to start again from scratch.   In college, making friends was effortless and I wasted no time. I knew hundreds and hundreds of people after just a year there but, just as it was in high school, I didn’t much feel that I could count on any of them for anything. But is that even important? By that I mean… should friends be anything more than people you enjoy spending time with?  Hoping on over to present day, I still have plenty of friends. And, let me be honest with you, they’re some of the best friends a guy could ever hope for. And yet, somehow, I’m still disappointed. I couldn’t put my finger on it for a while and the past few months I’ve wrestled with it somewhat silently. I have all these friends and I’m still lonely. Why? Then it hit me. I’m expecting my friends to fill a space that they don’t have to…   Hear me out…  I kept expecting some sort of magic safety net… if I ever fell, I was ok what with all the friends I have, right? Someone was bound to help… or at least understand. But, though some tried to help, no one really understood. And I’m terrible at explaining myself… so I put a smile on and moved on when the shit hit the fan. And tactics like that are doomed to fall apart someday. My real problem, I’m coming to realize, was that no one took much time to get to know me – and, for whatever reason, I sort of expected them to do so. I’ve always been a decent friend to people for the most part but rarely have I ever had a chance at the “close friend” role. So I foolishly go to these people expecting help or support or whatever it is I’m looking for (most times I don’t much know) and of course they’re at a loss for what to say or do. Outside of the context of a party, hanging out, or the occasional late night conversation, there wasn’t much. Now, that’s not to say that there wasn’t anything… or even to say that there was only a little or that what was there was somehow insignificant…  This is as good a time as any to get to the point…  What are friends for? All we’ve heard via TV, radio, and such lead us to believe that friends are to be these wonderful pillars in our lives – “Friends give you wings to fly”… and all that. But what if they aren’t? What if friends are nothing more than people you enjoy spending time with? Now look, I understand that “friend” means different things to different people but I think it’s fair to say that we’ve all looked to our friends for support at some point. My question is, what do you do when they won’t help?... or can’t help? I mean you can’t exactly get pissed at them. No one made any promises so none were broken. What’s more, the fact that, for whatever reason, they’re unable to help you doesn’t make them any less of a friend. They’re trying to get by… just like you… let go of your artificial expectations. As cold as that may sound, it’s true. It’s a little ridiculous to be pissed or disappointed in someone who really hasn’t made any type of commitment.  I know I know… I have yet to answer my own question… what are friends for? I don’t much have anything in the way of a solid definition. I can say that friendship, as I’ve come to know it, means enjoying one another’s company for as long as it is mutually beneficial. Let’s be honest… that’s all you can really hope for or count on. These dramatic definitions of friends saving lives and pulling one another out of the gutter are cheaper and more contrived than all the day time dramas combined. We’ve come to believe that our friends somehow owe us something because they associate with us. What’s more, we lie to one another as a means of indicating how important the other is with such clichés as “If you ever need me, call… no matter what time” and “I’d do anything for you”. Try calling on someone who has said this to you and see what kind of reception you get.   Obvious lies.  Why?  Real friends don’t have to make promises or declarations. Such things are understood. What’s more, no real friend would expect another friend to take on the burden of their distresses. That’s just plain selfish. Your burdens are your own, chum. If you haven’t learned that by now, you soon will. Those lofty pop-culture borne ideals of what a friend should be are flat out wrong. Friends are not our lifelines. Let’s be honest with one another here – we wouldn’t trust the majority of our friends with our CD’s… to hell with our emotional wellbeing. Expect anything but good times and warm smiles and you’re in for some bitter disappointment.  I wasted a hell of a lot of time having high expectations of my “close” friends. I made myself available to them at anytime – I mean I never said no… not because I’m such a great guy but because it was the thing to do – it’s how I thought friendship worked. Likewise, I expected the same from them. When I did end up needing people, I looked around and saw that they kept on partying and working and living their lives while I sorted out my messes and confusions alone. I couldn’t figure out how to say “Hey! I need you!” and so I became even more depressed, confused and alone. No one really paid much attention and it bothered me a good deal until I finally said to myself… why should they? Why should anyone help me with the messes I’ve gotten myself into? Hell, it’s  my  life, my problems, my responsibility. If friends decide to get involved, more power to them. If not, don’t let yourself be catapulted into depression and confusion and whatnot. Get over it and deal with it yourself. Honestly.  Somehow we’ve come to believe that we can’t do it all on our own – that we need friends and loved ones to “carry us through”… carry us through what? Are you serious? I guarantee this:  Putting trust in anyone but yourself is bound to get you hurt  and, if you’re particularly unlucky, it’ll lose you some quality friends. Look, I’m not saying I don’t trust anyone – I certainly trust my mother and a good number of other people. I am saying that believing that you can truly count on anyone but yourself to help you out of hard times or into good ones is just plain foolish. People let you down… that’s what they do. I’ll tell you right now, it’ll be a long time before I trust anyone with more than a joke and a beer.   Dexter you old fart! This is bullshit! I completely trust my close friends with my life and I’m sure they trust me with theirs. They’ve helped me out of countless rough spots and I know that I can count on them whenever I need them.   How nice for you. Listen… all it’s gonna take is one time… you’re in dire need and you look around and no one is their but you and your problems. What are you gonna do when there are no phone calls to make or IM’s to send that’ll solve everything? Short-armed bastards like you will end up a pile of snot and worry. You’ll choke down a few of mommy’s magic pills to help you sleep a good long forever sleepytime nap and your friends will forget about you before the earth above your head is firm. What makes me so sure?  Your friends are liars… all of them  You can trust me on this one – I’m not one of your friends.  They tell you what they think you want to hear. They tell you what they think will get you out of the funk you’re in. They really don’t give much of a shit about anything but how you behave. As far as your actual well-being is concerned, they could care less. Why? Well… there’s really nothing than can do or even want to do about it… furthermore, they don’t want to hear about problems that they can’t immediately solve or give you a quick answer to – as long as you’re quiet about it, they won’t mention it either. And so long as they can get a good time out of you, they’ll take that as a sign that everything is ok and move right along.   Wake up – it’s true. And you thought you had “true friends”? – glad I had the privilege of disappointing you.   And, again, why should it be any different? Why should are friends be anything more than people who enjoy our company?     You’ll waste half of your life looking for friends “just like on TV and in the movies!” only to find that such people do not exist. We’re not alone in life, that much is true, but all the work is on our shoulders. The most you can hope for is a few lookers on.   What are friends for?  Hell, with all this babbling, I don’t think I’ve answered that question exactly. And, to be honest, I don’t yet claim to know what friends are for… or if there is actually an answer to that question. I do know what they are  not  for. (see above)  Don’t expect your friends to make you into anything – a happier,  saner, more mature, fulfilled person…. Any of that bullshit – that’s all up to you entirely.   It’s your life and you are on your own. Friends are better than video games...  Get your fucking weight up, chump.   ---  Dexter Otis Green

       A Fireside Chat with Uncle Vicodin    Tripped and fell this afternoon… leg hurts like a bitch.  I’ve been fighting it for most of the day, and I’ve finally given in and popped a vicodin.  So let’s see how my writing degenerates as I slip into madness, eh?  So I’m just going to be keeping a running tab of what’s going on around me, self editing as little as possible, though I will admit to doing some just now.  I will also admit to listening to rent… 525600 minutes… dunno why it’s on my computer.  GOnna change it. Switching over to jesus Christ superstar.  Big fan.  I love how judas and Christ are portrayed… so deliciously blasphemous, or so the religious right would have you believe.  Kinda gives them both a human edge… which makes sense.  Even the greatest heroes and storymakers among us are, at their cores, just people.  Talented, maybe.  But by and large, they’re just like you and me, if we were put into an extraordinary situation.  I mean, how’d you react to being told you’re god’s son, sent to save the world by dying for it?  Ok… I think I’m gonna switch off of JCSS, cause it’s a little too religious… just gonna listen to heaven on their minds and rock it back on the back burnere until such time as I’m not about to lose motor skills and basic judgement. Badass guitar riff… ROCK! Powerful voice, crazy bidness… I think I’m gonna have a cigarette.  I like cigarettes. Judas is badass.  In the musical.  And the bible, I guess… I mean, if it weren’t for judas growing some balls and selling jesus out, he wouldn’t have been able to die on the cross, right?  So in a sense, judas had to do what he did.  Should he be punished for this?  Or if you take the ‘judas possessed by satan’ stance, should satan be punished for indirectly enabling salvation?  Doesn’t make a lot of sense.  	Ok, new section, to be started as JCSS is eliminated… voted off the aural island, so to speak. For continuity’s sake, it should be stated that this was written before the heaven on their minds commentary.  And…. Action.  Kid A is playing now… much better atmospheric music.  Everything in its right place… I like it.  Am I starting to fragment yet?  I hope not… there’s no discernable pain relief… I burned my finger on a hot skillet the other  day… wonder if that’ll stop hurting too… I suppose it will.  Now, for no particular reason, I’m staring at an executioner miniature given to me by my roommate.  It’s from his trip to London.  He looks vaguely sinister, standing over miniature Frodo, sitting in my desk lamp/ organizer. I have a set of RPG dice and casino dice there too.  I have a weakness for purchasing dice.  It’s not like I’m a statistician, or anything.  Nor do I think all things are left to chance, or luck.  Nor do I believe that it’s destiny, either.  It seems like everything just… is.  In its right place, I suppose.  My damned speakers are buzzing because of the sick amount of bass being thrown off by Thom yorke and his cronies.  I have to turn down the volume.  Kind of makes everything quiet, and distant.  The Vicodin will likely intensify this feeling.  The tactile reality of the keys beneath my fingers is creating a not entirely unpleasant sensation.  Ah, delicious double negatives.  They’re fun, letting you be dramatic in speech and prose.  Even though they’re redundant.  But writing is being redundant.  So why are they so often avoided in grade school comp classes?  If I were to write as succinctly as possible, it wouldn’t be very interesting.  Of course, this article might not be very interesting either.  Fuck it.  I’m plodding along.  Hit track three already.  I used to fall asleep to Kid A, but now I prefer this odd little mp3 track I picked up somewhere or another.  It’s kind of droning background music, with whacky little pulses, supposedly stimulating REM sleep.  It does, for all I know.  I rarely remember my dreams… they’re gone as my eyes open.  Sometimes I mentally grasp at the grains of sand which are my dreams as they slip through my fingers, descending into the vast oblivion that lies directly beneath our waking lives.  It’s a fine line, you know.  Between reality and oblivion.  Water is good.  Nice and cold… I enjoy the feeling of drinking an ice cold glass of water when you’re really thirsty and haven’t had anything in your system for a while… you feel the chill go down through your upper body.  A similar sensation is achieved when you drink a hot beverage on a cold day.  But you know that already don’t you?  I don’t know why I’m chronicling it… it just seems like the thing to do.  This is as close to stream of consciousness as I get.  There are many more things slipping around in my head, but I can’t type fast enough to get them all down.  I can barely keep up with what I’m trying to focus on.  I’m making it a little bit of a race, trying to write it down so quickly that I can catch up, but I don’t think I’ll be able to. Eh… fuck it.  I guess I’m writing crazy talk because everyone else seems to be.  You won’t know it while reading this, but there was a considerable dramatic pause right there.  It would be interesting to develop a way to … looking for the word.  Just a moment… read in real time, at the same speed the author wrote it down… kind of like spoken word, but with writing.  In retrospect, this is a strange and terrible idea which sucks.  Scratch it.  I was briefly considering going back through what I’ve written down so far, but I decided against it, since it would bias the rest of the piece.  It now occurs to me that biasing the piece doesn’t really matter… hypotheticals are bullshit.  But still, I’m not going back, even though I could and it would be alright.  Maybe later on I will.  It might be entertaining.  I have a fantastic set of tapes which feature E.E. Cummings reading many of his poems… it’s on four cassettes, and he goes through all of his really well known ones, as well as his more obscure ones… including ones I’ve never read.  It is a really fantastic collection because going back and reading the poems afterwards, you can see the flow the man had, even though his text is formatted like a crazy person using magnetic poetry.  It makes me look at his work in a completely different way.  Poems are good because reading them and hearing them offer two vastly different experiences.  Don’t remember when I took the pill, but it should be a half hour after that point where my crazy will truly begin to set in… felt a chill across my brain, which might mean that it’s coming along.  So bear with me.  Just did a word count… upwards of 1200 words.  Definitely feeling changes.  Getting a little lightheaded.  Wish I had a laptop so I could sit in bed and type that way.  But alas, I must suffer.  Oh well… my hands have developed many more scars over the past year or so than I’d ever had on them before.  The burn from the skillet, which I talked about before… plus a couple where I whanged my hand pretty hard, and started to bleed… they’re still discolored, even though I got them a while ago.  Wonder if they’ll ever fade into that sickly white associated with so many other scars.  I also have pit in my lip where a mother of a cold sore lived.  You love to hear about that, don’t you?  Herpes herpes bo berpes… heh heh.  But that ones’ not going away.  I wonder what it would be like to have small pox…. Just nasty scars all about your face.  I wonder how people dealt with that… I mean, they’re shit loads worse than acne scars.  And acne scars are pretty bad. Wiped a little sweat off of my brow… cool to the touch.  Don’t know how long I’m going to be able to hold up with this… urge to sleep rising… although the headache is going away.  Glad I don’t have any alcohol in me… or I’d be really whacke… oh, wait… I had a hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps in it.  Hrm… this might complicate matters.  Oh well. Gonna take a short break.  	Ok, back.  I wrote that before the break.  For continuity’s sake.    wow… I just smileyed…. Weird.  Emoticons and net lingo have really pervaded our vernacular, haven’t they?  Ok … water break. Ok, back. All this talk about emoticons made me check my buddy list to see who’s about.  I compulsively check away messages… just scroll down the whole list.   Do any of you remember when they used to add checking profiles to your typing block limit?  The little bar under send.  I hated that.  Sometimes I would get locked out of being able to type.  It’s disturbing to be disallowed expression.  It seems very symbolic, but that might be the drugs talking.  And ladies and gentlemen, let me assure you, they are talking.  gonna lay down for a little bit.  Be right back.  Drew just woke me up with a phone call… I only picked out like an eighth of the words he was saying…. Confusing and unsettling.  Dunno. Radiohead has reset… For some reason, I’m now remembering burning this to cd and giving it to my ex girlfriend.  I remember drawing a crude facsimile of the bear with the teeth.  Which is My buddy Icon, I’m pretty sure… checking… just a moment. Yup, it is.  My arm is numb.  Makes typing an interesting prospect.  I’m typing much more slowly now, I might have just embarrassed myself thru IM… I guess I didn’t.  Talking to heather… one of my very good friends.  False alarm, I have officially embarrassed myself… letting slip my nefarious plans to seduce her with booze.  Hopefully it will slide under the radar.  I’ve added a wink smiley to make it more innocent, although trying to spin a plan for seduction into innocent banter is a difficult proposition.  She’s not answering… this could be a bad sign.  Eh… these things happen.  I’m eyeing my cigarettes.  Also a bad sign, since I know I just had one.    Words start to look funny when you single them out and disassociate their meaning form their makeup.  If you repeat them in your head over and over… they also start to sound funny.  Like you’re talking crazy gibberish talk.  Which also might be true regardless. Third time around for radiohead.    I’m hitting the return button more often now… the worst of the dizziness is gone, and everything is kind of separating, like I’m lifting off… and sort of floating above myself.  It’s kind of a dangerous place to be, because I am not particularly self conscious at this point, and don’t care for/ recognize consequences.  I like the way the shadows play ac5ross my bedspread… very abstract and whacky.. I think I’m going to lay down now.   --  Scott "The Slater" Slater

       Nigger: A word collection    wongdongy:  if you want to know what some white people say behind closed doors  Guinness AML:  we know... but go ahead  wongdongy:  that there are black people and then there are niggers  wongdongy:  black people are just that  wongdongy:  people that are black  wongdongy:  and niggers are drug dealers or whatever  wongdongy:  oh, but you probably already knew that  wongdongy:  but yeah, that’s what some peoples stance on the matter is Guinness AML: Chris rock did a similar bit on the subject  wongdongy:  ohh, haha  Guinness AML:   :-)  wongdongy:  that’s probably what its from  Guinness AML:      Guinness AML:   they have no idea what they're talking about... and don't know the meaning of the word  Guinness AML:   Nigger doesn't just mean "bad black person"  wongdongy:  I don’t even know the origin  Guinness AML:   Nigger means "Not a person... less than human" really... not directly - but that's the sense of the word  wongdongy:  hmm  Guinness AML:   nigger means "unworthy of any respect, dignity, or rights"  wongdongy:  so if I called a white child molestor a "nigger" would that be in the wrong context?  Guinness AML:   yes  Guinness AML:   because the word has come to be assigned to blacks  wongdongy:  so it means specifically black people   Guinness AML:   it sure does   …   	It’s been over 15 years but I can still remember my first day of 3rd grade. I went to predominantly white schools from 3rd grade on up. Before then, growing up in Hartford, CT’s North End, I rarely ever saw white people other than teachers and a few folk when I went downtown with my mother. It goes without saying, then, that I had no white friends. In fact, I hated white people.   	 Hated.    	Then, one evening, my mom came over to me and my younger brother and told us that we were going to a new school. Just like that, a new school. I didn’t have many friends in school, anyway, so leaving them wasn’t all that big a deal. My short lived (and utterly useless) protests came from the fact that it was a WHITE school. White people, white teachers, white nurses, white music, white everything… it honestly terrified me.  Let me explain.  I believed the following to be true about white people:  -- White people are rich…  all of them  -- White people are snotty and talk funny. -- White people eat weird food - white people food. (Swear to god) -- White people are smart – black people have to work twice as hard as white people. -- White people listen to disturbing music. Because of it, some white people worship the devil. -- White people can’t dance, sing, or play sports as well as black people.  and most importantly…  -- White people HATE black people. Period. Even if they claim to be your friend, they’re lying. They want something from you. Black friends are valuable – they’re evidence against racism – “I can’t be racist – look at my black (nigger) friend! See?!”   	It’s also important to note that these things that I believed to be true about white people I never ever believed could be true about black people.   	White people were pretty much evil and white people were certainly the enemy.    	So, with all these prejudices, I went to my first day of 3rd grade shaking like a leaf. I thought that I’d come back acting like a white kid after a few days of school. I thought they’d try to jump me. I had to defend myself. I had to stay black at all costs. Walking down the hall to my classroom, I felt white eyes on me constantly and was very uncomfortable. Every pair of eyes said “Who is  that  (NIGGER!) kid? Why is he in my school? He doesn’t belong here”. I got to my first class and sat alone preparing for the inevitable introduction. Sure enough, I was brought to the front of the class and with my eyes on my cheap sneakers, I gave my name. Eyebrows curled and there were a few laughs because of my accent. I blushed hard and made note of their laughter – evidence. Then, it happened. “He’s from HARTFORD and he’ll be joining our class by way of Project Concern*”, my teacher chimed with a toothy white grin.   …   	As far as I was concerned, she may as well have said, “Be careful – this one is a dangerous nigger – HE doesn’t belong here” I sat down feeling even more alienated than ever.   	School was easy for the first half of the day. I was in class with no more than 5 kids at a time most of the time so that worked out fine. But I was still very uncomfortable being around all those white people. Then lunch came and I freaked. I had made zero friends that day which meant I either had to sit alone or sit with white people and try to make friends.    	I sat alone.    	I remember sitting with my left arm around my tray, eyeballing the cafeteria DARING anyone to sit near me. I was so lonely and, part of me really wanted someone to come over. But I wasn’t going to let them make me white. So I did the easiest thing a black kid could do in that school. I looked intimidating.   	Months passed, seasons changed and I had made friends with the kids on my bus (also from Hartford) and a few kids in school. They treated me like a visitor but it was ok. I had a few friends and that was better than eating alone. I had a small group of friend to go on the swings with at recess. Life wasn’t all that bad.   	”Nigger!”   	what?...    	I looked up from a game of Speedball and my new friend… we’ll call him Dick Spiffy - was pointing at me.   	He was pointing at  me ? Was I a nigger?   	    	I knew I was black and that black people were sometimes called niggers by white people. But it was an entirely different thing to actually be called “Nigger” outright. I was, to say the least, a little confused. Then, it hit me. It hit me light a lightning bolt and I took off after him.   	I beat the crap out of him.   	In the principal’s office, I got nothing but sympathy. It didn’t go on my file or anything like that. It was dropped and I went back to class. But something had changed in me that took years to fix.   	The question lingered. Nigger? ME!?! Am I a nigger? I didn’t know if it was true. Until then, I never had to ask myself if it was  true … and, if it was true… if I was a nigger… what did that mean?   	Nigger was something they called slaves. It was worse than a bad word… it was a curse. When Dick resurrected that word, it felt worse than anything I had ever felt. I couldn’t say why then but I think I knew. Nigger meant “You are nothing – you are not one of us – You will never be one of us – You are less… low… and worthy of contempt”. It was the embodiment of the evils of slavery. In North America, from the 1500s to 1865, “Nigger” connoted “black slave” but also “Maroon (A fugitive Black slave in the West Indies in the 17th and 18th centuries).” From then on, “Nigger” connoted “second-class citizen” as well as “Maroon”… visitor… outcast. 23 years later it meant the very same thing when Dick used it on me… “Outcast! – Unclean!”   	Not one of you reading this needs the history of the word to know what it means.   	We all know what it means. There’s a definition beyond my words that we’re all familiar with. Nigger = hate. It’s all but impossible to know how fucked up of a word it is until that hate is directed at you.    	Then there came Wigger.   	Wow… Wigger? Are you fucking kidding me?  WIGGER?!    	For the slow ones, “Wigger” is a clever combination of words – “White” and “Nigger”.  Astonishing.  	Let me get this straight… a wigger is a “White Nigger”? What does that mean, exactly? Some kid wears Fubu and listens to 50-cent and Biggie and… well now he’s a Nigger… but he can’t be a  nigger  nigger because he’s white… so he’s a  white  nigger… a wigger… hahahaha! _ that’s clever… that’s funny!      Guinness AML:  You know why I hate wigger more than nigger?  Guinness AML:  Amercian blacks were given the word nigger and told "This means you're nothing"  Guinness AML:  they took it and, over time, changed it to mean "This means we're family" - it's an identifier... a sacred word  Guinness AML:  which is why I can call a black person a nigger and you can't  wongdongy:  wow  Guinness AML:  Wigger is thievery  wongdongy:  haha  Guinness AML:  we were given shit and made it an heirloom  Guinness AML:  and now it's being taken back?!  Guinness AML:  FUCK that   	Yes – it is  our  word. Your grandfathers gave it to us, remember? They made sure we knew that it belonged to us and only us.   	And it does.   	Wigger isn’t an outright attempt at reclaiming the word but… well once black folk made nigger cool, wigger pops up….this fucking generic bullshit word that manages to be more insulting than the first. How? By downplaying the significance of the word “nigger”… Chinese dude “actin’ black” yo? He’s a chigga, B.   	Nigger doesn’t mean black. Nigger IS black. It’s a black word. It’s a family curse that was converted to a blessing. A password. A conduit through which we can acknowledge the one thing that we all share – our victory over attempted dehumanization. We were once believed to be a dead people – less than animals. And, in many ways, we still live with the effects of the people who named us “nigger”. That’s why it’s our word… because it was given to us.  	There a number of things I want to say on this subject but I’m gonna cut myself short this time… no wrap up, no summary… none of that. Hope this reaches reasonable ears….    --  Dexter Otis Green    *(note: Project Concern was a voluntary urban-to-suburban student transfer program. – basically taking kids from the inner-city shitty schools and placing them in the better equipped suburban schools)    As an aside, keep your eyes and ears open for  Beer 'n Porn Radio ... coming soon

        Humanity: the Toolmakers, or just Tools? (or: on being 24 and some months…)    I’m 24 and loving it.  I get to sleep late, be bothered by friends and family that I don’t have a job (I’m looking, kids… trust me, I’m looking.), watch cartoons in my underpants, and write my thoughts for the whole web to see.  I’m trying my best not to be depressed about getting older, because I’m really not that old.  Although, for all our crazy amounts of advancement, it seems that our developmental stage is increasing a great deal.  When my parents were my age, they’d been married for three years.  And when their parents were my age, THEY’D been married for more like five or six.    This is not to say that Marriage is the ‘gateway to adulthood,’ but it’s a serviceable litmus for judging how responsible and in the real world a person is.  In the age of my grandparents, a high school education could feed a family.  For my parents, a bachelor’s degree most certainly sufficed.  Now, all my friends are taking Grad school courses, getting more and more advanced degrees, and hiding in the ivory tower well into their middle 20s.  Pretty soon Doctorates will be run of the mill, and people won’t be beginning their intended careers until they’re into their 30s.    	Is this a result of a longer life expectancy?  People are alive and kicking and active well into their 80s nowadays.  My Grandmother is full of pizzazz, and even remarrying (and don’t think for a minute I’m not a bit disturbed that sweet little gramma is getting more action than me nowadays).  Because life is longer, childhood follows suit.  Bunches of my friends still live with mom and dad (not that there’s anything wrong with that, wink wink).  It seems acceptable to return to the nest to save up some cash and plan the next step.  Maybe this ‘going home’ tendency is the reason for the prolonging of childhood.  And parents are of course not averse to this, because they’re watching their kids grow up faster than an eldritch DJ spins up ‘Cat’s in the Cradle’ at the social club mixer.  Maybe this is a good thing… maybe it’s keeping us young at heart.  But it remains a fact that folk are less willing to take on the responsibility that their folks and grandfolks took up at a much younger age.     	There’s another angle to this phenomenon… and it’s the reason I started this article.  I was sort of typing and filling space until I found the connection, and then BAM!  There it is.  We’re living longer, and also staying younger longer BECAUSE our forefathers had done things to promote a newer, shinier reality.  We are growing older more slowly because we have the benefit of their mistakes.    We have a history.   I’ve seen 2001: a space odyssey many times, and I love the whole movie, but one of the most interesting parts is in the beginning, with all the crazy monkeys.  They’re monkeying around, drinking water and being generally simian, when the monolith descends and sort of speeds up their evolution.  And the one monkey (I think his name was moonwatcher in the book, but don’t quote me)  is playing with the predator’s bone one hot desert day and comes to the realization that he can use it to bonk other creatures on the head.    A lot of people think (and I don’t necessarily disagree) that Monkeyface realizes he can use things as tools, and this is what makes him powerful enough to overcome the jaguar and the enemy tribe of monkeys, and eventually overcome the barriers of the earth itself.  We humans are hailed as the great toolmakers; we possess gadgets and objects of infinite intricacy and usefulness.  And we have the opposable thumbs to use them.  I love using them, myself, I’m looking at my shiny (though not much more useful than a piece of paper) Palmtop Computer… a cigarette lighter (fire is officially our bitch… take that, animal kingdom!)  plastic bottles, even the computer I’m using now.    But I think the fact that we are toolmakers is only a part of the equation.  All sorts of animals use tools.  Chimps use sticks to root out anthills, scratch their backs, et cetera.  Even without the opposable thumb we wave in front of them derisively, they still can make use of things not of their bodies.    So is it communication?  We have a wonderful language that allows us to convey things, like telling a fellow that a potted plant is about to fall on their head, or that you would like a hot dog with Cappy’s sauce upon it.    But that’s not it either… animals communicate too, at least on some level.   Bird’s mating calls… gorilla gestures, screeching warnings.  And perhaps more useful than even our language is the hive mind, allowing flocks of birds to intuitively move as one while migrating, silently striding packs of wolves hunting, ants almost instantly knowing where food is… the ability to work as a unit makes for a great deal of efficiency (At the cost of individuality, which is why cellphones and Instant Messenger scare me, but that’s another post altogether)  Neither toolmaking nor communication is man’s secret weapon, and although we’re damn good at it, we’re not the only game in town.  You’d think that animals, communicating and using tools for so many eons, would eventually get better at it, but they don’t.    Besides, tools and communication fail.  We’re at the mercy of our dayplanners.  Things that should be making us more time in fact give us less free time.  Hunters and gatherers had all day to look around and dream, once the berries and carcasses were all in the nomadic village.  It is this dreaming that really started the whole thing.  Tools seem almost counterintuitive; are we using the tools, or are the tools using us?  Communication, for all its flowery eloquence, also fails us.  There’s no real way of being sure that what we convey is that which is understood by those who receive.  Feelings might be universal, but for all we know, all perception is unique.  You and I do not feel the same anger, the same love, the same sadness, we don’t see the same car, the same hot blonde, the same color red.  For all of our wonderful words and objects, we remain, by and large, island universes.  We have nothing except a collectively shared, yet individually experienced, past.  History is what the beasts do not have.  They have instinct (which is badass, but there’s not much choice in it) but it’s way too slow.  An animal will be killed at the hands of men for generations upon generations before they get it into their heads that the bipeds are not to be trusted.  The life, and experience of an animal ends with that animal.  It passes on its genes, makes a baby wolf, and the instinct and the cycle continue.  Wolves can’t sit around the forest grove, fondly remembering Grandpa One Eye, reminiscing about how he once outsmarted the bobcat that one time, and wasn’t it funny as hell?    The scene in 2001 is less about a single monkey learning how to use a bone as a weapon, and more about that monkey coming to the realization that his actions, and the actions of his brothers, can have a lasting effect on the world.    History is communication to the nth degree.  Our past is what allows us to grow older and stand on the shoulders of our ancestors and make improvements on their innovations.  It allows us to observe both personal and collective progress within our lifetimes.  It gives us a bar which is silently begging to be jumped over and raised.  Our communications and our tools are only symptoms of our understanding of what has come before.  Our past has given us a future.  But when you really get down to it, our history is flawed.  It’s written by the victors, so sayeth Napoleon, and many stories and innovations are lost.  Misinformation and propaganda paint unreal pictures of the way things are.  Violent crime in this country decreases, and yet the media’s reporting of violent crime increases exponentially.  The powers that be understand the power of history, and use it to control reality.  We begin to see that what we’re taught about our past isn’t a really accurate picture.  The present becomes the past all too quickly these days.  Americans have short memories… I can remember the vigils held on October 11th, 2001, the vows to never forget the attack upon our nation.  I remember the moment of silence on the radio on September 11th, 2002.  But this past year?  I don’t remember a single thing, save some idle chatter on msnbc.  It’s being pulled out again for the sake of election campaigns, but it will once again fade into obscurity, adorning the pages of history books as a footnote for the beginning of the 21st century.    History is our salvation, our opiate, and ultimately, our crutch and our untimely demise.  More and more information is out there these days, thanks to the internet… but the net is in a state of constant flux.  Websites change, but there is no record of what came before it.  It’s going too fast.  Instinct has the benefit and disadvantage of being slow, it seems.  It takes its time and makes DAMN sure that the information is good and correct.  It does so at the cost of individual members in the species.  If our information age were to fail, what then?  Tribes of barbarians, sweeping through the streets of cities, destroying history. It would be the fall of Rome, all over again.  The Dark ages.  A time to gather together in the hollow shells of our technology, and try to piece together what we lost. We don’t have the benefit of a rich oral tradition, save a collective memorization of the Adam Sandler ‘Hanukkah Song’.  We couldn’t teach our children much more than survival.  If a dark age were to come upon us right now, our wonderful and terrible tools would rust, unused, unknown.  150 years from now, buckskin clad great grandchildren would be drying hides on the interstates, smashing open skulls with back massagers. Needless to say, it would be a considerable setback.  So I was wrong… history isn’t the answer.  Now, bear with me.  Perhaps at the moment of cogitation, a new kind of organism was born: the Idea. It’s a simpler sort of history… and maybe history itself is an idea.  But think about how ideas work.  Passed from person to person, constantly mutating, spreading, dying out.  It sounds almost like a virus.  Maybe it is… a sort of electrical impulse virus soaring through words and feelings. Perhaps instinct is the evolutionary forefather of the idea, passed genetically, slowly...   Sprouting forth from instinct, Our brains were fertile grounds for the Ideas.  The mental capacity grew, and so grew innovation.  Designated as the vessels of ideas, we watch some of them grow, while some die on the vine.  Like the Gods we thought they were, Ideas have only to be forgotten to be killed. Stronger ideas seem to spread like wildfire, and sometimes two ideas that contradict have themselves a little conflict.  Holy wars, Inquisitions, Crusades.  And all the rest.  So are we at the whim of our ideologies?  Is it like some Douglas Adams novel, where lab mice are in control, and we are made to believe the opposite?  Are we the warships and Bentleys of a bunch of neurological impulses?  Are we just material side effects?  The fleshy housing of the abstract?  This seems to be a dismal way of looking at ourselves.  I like to think we ARE our abstractions, and we're sometimes caught up in the tangibility of it all.  Reality, expression, all of it is just a set of corporeal training wheels, itching to be taken off by some cosmic socket wrench.  We may someday transcend into pure energy… because after all, matter is simply energy that is trapped.  I look forward to the day when my great great Grandchildren (or grandnephews, I’m not counting that particular chicken until she’s in my bed) will shake off these obsolete earthly bindings, and float seamlessly into the Aether.  Maybe it will happen within my lifetime.  Innovation is happening more and more quickly… Following the Ideas up to the present, Agriculture to Smithing, to Industry, to computers, to god knows what’s been invented this week… there’s exponentially less time between leaps, and the distance each leap covers is growing exponentially the other way.  So in time, there will be a critical juncture, as these equations we call life reach their asymptotes, and everything will start happening very quickly.  So don’t get caught with your pants down.  To quote an enlightened being who was trying to eliminate all the needless law and rhetoric (again, another post altogether), ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,’ or somesuch… all I know is, it’s going to be a hell of a ride.  Our childhoods are lengthening because we need to have the limber minds of the young in order to transcend.  All this advancement, all this history, all these conversations could be preparing us for something amazing.  Maybe we need to cast off the tools and speeches and knowledge that has brought us this far, like booster rockets falling off of a space shuttle, hurtling towards the inky depths of space, expanding infinitely, and becoming what we were meant to be.   whether we like it or not, whether we KNOW about it or not…  we are, all of us, constantly becoming.  Here’s to 24.      --The Slater

       One Year for Every Hour: Birthday Reflections    So it comes to this - birthday comes and strips away a year of youth… slaps on a shiny new coat of old. Everything is the same and everything is the same. I keep telling myself that it’s only a year… that the big difference is saying “24” instead of “23”… is it?… am I?? Haven’t I changed? Is this some kinda trick?  I have.  I wasn’t losing my hair at fifteen. I know that. I was all about getting feminine stinky on my “hang down”. I didn’t drink and hardly smoked. I masturbated like I would win something if I could just… blow… one… more… load… and I was getting laid on a fairly regular basis. My sex drive could have powered 31 city blocks. I was wonderfully naïve, impossibly beautiful, and goddamn indestructible. Cruel, really – no one should remember being that young.   Who am I kidding?   That was nine years ago! That’s all. I have changed. But when? Everything always looks the same when I glance back just one year. Is the change that subtle? I think it is…  I should do something.  I should work out.  I’m out of shape. I’m not a big guy… I just want to be able to run a little and not be so worn out or in so much pain after I decide to pick up a piece of sports equipment. I want to be able to wear t-shirts and maybe even show off my arms. Fat people can be cruel. I wish I was one of them. They get all of the attention.  Working out will change things.  I should change my diet. Look at the crap I’m eating! I complain about my health and my weight and then I sit down to the culinary equivalent of a swift kick to the “Holy Jehosephat!” (which I undoubtedly deserved)… no wonder I feel like crap. I feel like crap because I eat like crap. I’d get a personal trainer but I don’t have the money. That’s it. From now on I’m doing 50 push-ups every morning. This time I mean it.  I won’t follow through.   I never follow through. Not when it comes to this. Maybe one day I’ll be fat and happy.  Acne is gone! From my face anyway. There’s apparently an aggressive colony that’s moved to my back. How sexy is that? I should use a special soap. I should condition my hair. I’ll pick those up.  I won’t pick those up. I never do.  I feel like I know myself too well to surprise myself anymore. I’ve got me pegged. I’ll plan and fantasize but, in the end, I won’t. In the end, I won’t. I’ll explain it away. I’ll find some way to put it off.  Maybe I don’t always put it off.  I may. I think I do.  I’m lonely. I really don’t want to find someone, though. It’s all about sex. No one talks anymore. What the hell is that about? What? How big is my what? Are you serious? So now I fall in love with anyone who’s attractive that’ll talk to me. That’ll show me some sign that they’re interested in conversation.  I’m pathetic.  Am I ranting?  Am I bitching?  There’s really no point. I say over and over that there are two options “Do something or do nothing”. I’m not sure of the true of that statement anymore. It sounds true though so I’ll stick with it.  I can’t drink anything like I used to in college. I drink like old men at the bar drink.  My friends are too young.  I need a vacation from my problems.  I’m happy.  I know what’s going on. There’s still so much time to make a difference. To change. To make a difference. To change. I just have to figure out how? I know how. I mean I just have to figure out if I want to go. I know where I want to go. I just need to know how to get there. I hope it’s not far.  Everything is ok – proceed as planned.  I think I’ll be fine. I’m sure I’ll at least be ok. I got plenty of scotch on my birthday. Sometimes I can be such a child. I think that admission deserves a drink.  24… 23… what the fuck am I complaining about? I’m still young! There’s so much goddamn time ahead of me. What will I do? Things. How will I do them? Same way I always have.  There.   That’s better.  Though I should probably at least have a plan.  I’m no good at making plans. I never stick to plan.  A good blowjob would clear my mind. Someone should get on that. I’m right bored with masturbating… which means I need to put it off for a while. Tuck that lil’ salve back in the medicine cabinet until next week. Why in God’s name am I sharing this?  :::CENSORED:::  I should watch more TV… become more MTv… then I’ll feel younger. I worried about being “regular” for the first time. I considered Rogaine. What’s happening to me?  :::breathing:::  One year for every hour. That’s how old I am. I think I maybe should start getting ready for 25. That’s a number I can work with. I’ll be happy then. But it won’t last.  It never lasts.  ::chuckle::  -- Dexter Otis Green

       “Hungry?” And Other Ridiculous Questions and Notions III: Don’t they know I’m as cool as a fan?   I like beer.  …a lot  … Maybe too much but… well that’s beside the point for now.  I’ve been boozing it up for years now and for the most part I can’t complain. Booze is a cheap lil’ vacation in a bottle and I’ve spent the better part of my college career “traveling”. No worries – I now know that, though Scotland is a great place to visit damn near anytime time of year (so long as you have the stomach for it). Russia isn’t some place you’d want to be very often. It gets a little dangerous.   Mexico is right out.   But enough of my booze euphemisms. Before I became the respectable lush that I am today, I was quite the glassy eyed pothead. I loved pot more than life itself. Granted, I was 14 when I took that first magic toke of smoke – stands to reason that I, like so many disillusioned youth, hated life… hell I would go as far as to say that I loved :::insert school lunch menu item here::: more than life.  Anywho…  [ don’t they know I’m as cool as a fan? ]  I smoked pot by the bale and, after a time, came to wonder about other drugs. I had always wondered about all drugs; cocaine, heroin, PCP, ecstasy – all of that fun stuff and more. I only delayed experimenting because of the lies my teachers had told me about what happens to people that do drugs. You’ve all heard them before and probably still believe the garbage they filled you with.  :::chuckle:::  It’s hogwash but, for once, I won’t go the route of attempted enlightenment. Research for yourself the truth about drugs and what they can and can not do to your body… and your life for that matter. Suffice it to say that most people that use drugs recreationally or habitually live normal happy lives. The broken minority, however, gets all the press…  So be it….  I lost my fear of drugs entirely because of pot. After smoking pot, I found out that pot, at least, most likely wouldn’t kill me… ever…   Ever.   I defy any of you readers to tell me of a death or serious injury directly related to pot. They are few and far between… and I guarantee the numbers for booze and cigarettes are hundreds of times higher. Too bad our forefathers didn’t think to market all kinds of poison, eh?   [ I’m not your average Joe. ]  Anywho, pot freed me from fear that had been imposed upon me by my lying teachers and their lying books and pamphlets. Had I more cash (and were I a little braver and younger), I’d certainly give a number of drugs a try. Here they are in no particular order:     urlLink  Shrooms    Shrooming is at the top of my list of things to do… by which I mean after I’ve gotten over my seemingly irrational “fear” of them. In all honesty, I think I’m more excited than afraid though I certainly am a little apprehensive about having a bad trip. I do hope, though, that one day this fear will have dissipated thus making my palette a prime target for those shadow grown dreamweavers. I’m dying for a taste of that secret knowledge.  [ I’ll be anything you need ]   urlLink  Cocaine   	 I want to know what all the buzz is about. Coke used to be such a cool drug back in the 80’s. I mean nothing was more rock star than doing lines off of a hooker’s ass before a show. If you want my opinion, I think Don Johnson and Cindy Lauper fucked it up for the rest of us. Now coke has more or less become a Wall Street drug. Hell, even shitty models and porn stars don’t snort anymore… which is a shame because I’ll bet that’s how they managed the waif look.  [ Play the game ]   urlLink  Heroin    You read that right. I want to take a ride on the “H” train. And, thanks to some creative junkies, you don’t have to inject heroin all up in your arm-piece :::turntable scratch:::. That’s right! You can snort that shit, B! So that rocks. But I have more experience with smoking than anything else and heroin is smokable as well so... I mean there you go. I’m mostly worried about addiction and being able to “handle my high”. As far as addiction goes, though, I’m already riding one helluva snake with nicotine… which beats heroin hands down in the dependency department   Interesting heroin factoid:  An estimated 25 to 40% of street users are not physically dependent   Now that's something to think about. If heroin were cooler and had less of a back-alley junkie vibe, I’d probably have given it a whirl already. As it stands now, I just don’t have the cash or the drive.  [ Can’t nobody break my stride ]    urlLink PCP/Ketamine    I have no idea what they do and, quite frankly, I don’t care. Who among you readers can boast having done up the night with PCP? I sure as hell can’t. And Special K? Man oh man! The name alone is more enticing than Shannon Elizabeth in that pie fucking movie. I sho’ ‘nuff want me some o’ that! But seriously, I think what draws me to PCP (or Ketamine [special K]… a weaker and less toxic version of PCP) is the mystery of it all. What’s it do? My pals at Thegooddrugsguide.com had this to say:   ”At low doses, K is a mild if weird stimulant. At medium to high doses, it becomes a very powerful paralysing psychedelic. It effects are like a combination of cocaine, cannabis, opium, Nitrous Oxide, and alcohol.”   …I mean so there you go right there.   [ Suddenly life has new meaning to me ]   urlLink  LSD     	:::ahem::: The most powerful mind-altering substance known to man. I think I’m done here.  [ Meet me in outer space ]    I’m really in search of a step down from nicotine… something a little… I dunno… sexier, you know? Nicotine is so bromidic… so cliche… so damn uninspiring. I need a drug with a bit more oomph, a little more class, and a hell of a lot more sass. A drug I can bring home to mama. A back alley drug with high class appeal. An uptown drug with downtown sensibilities… a girl-next-door drug with leather dungeon fantasies… dig? A missionary position drug with “knee pad” capabilities if you catch my drift.  Right now, I’m pretty much waiting for prices to level off before I start investing. That or I’ll just have to wait until I’m a rock star… fucking slurping LSD out of a hooker’s bellybutton while taking a liquidy dump in her face… only a matter of time.  Don’t be afraid of drugs. Be honest with yourself and explore your curiosity about altered states and mind expansion.  …and if you’ve got the hook-up for “china white”, you know who to call   :::business card:::    -- Dexter Otis Green

      Damn, didn’t I used to write for this disturbing genital sore of a website? It’s been way too long…   Anyways, some quick updates, and then a little bit o’postin’ for the chillins.  First off, I’m sure you’ve heard the rumors about BEER AND PORN RADIO, and I’m here to tell you that they are TRUE. BEER AND PORN RADIO is in the works, and we’re hoping to bring the same depraved, offensive commentary to you in audio form sometime in the next few months. How will it work, you ask? The stream will be broadcast from the Internet on demand, meaning you’ll be able to listen to each episode at your own leisure, whenever you wish! Most importantly, the stream will be FREE! That’s right, no need to scour porn and warez sites looking for Beer n Porn MP3s – just follow the links from right here on the site and your virgin ears will be basted in the love juice we call social commentary. Check the site often for more details.  Second, we’ve recently added a new feature to BEER AND PORN. If you look above the posts you’ll see a link for the BEER AND PORN MESSAGE BOARDS. Here’s your chance to interact with others who waste their time reading Beer and Porn, along with the depraved souls who author the crap you read here every day! It’s free to sign up, and within minutes you’ll be trading sexually explicit jokes with the rest of us here at Beer and Porn! A word of caution – nothing on the board is censored, so if you have a weak soul or are prone to being offended, it’s best if you move on to something a little more tame, like the Disney online store or something. Otherwise, we’d love to have you!  Third, it’s time for a little shout out. We’re always excited to hear about Beer and Porn fans from around the globe. Your pal and mine, Mr. Dexter Otis Green, has done a fan-freakin-tastic job of tracking our readership across the globe. Recently, he identified the FIRST INSTANCE OF A PERSONAL WEBSITE LINKING TO BEER AND PORN! This is a monumental, historic moment in the annals of the Internet. Not only are people reading this tripe, but they are coming back, and they are TELLING THEIR FRIENDS! I am flush with pride and arrogance!  [DRUM ROLL, PLEASE]  Congratulations, AILIN from NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA! We’ve found your Beer and Porn link on your fantastic, award-winning webpage, and we’re here to say thanks! You are just the first step towards our eventual conquest of Canada, which we will use as the base for our global empire! You have earned yourself a high-ranking position in our eventual ruling government thanks to your obedience to the Beer and Porn movement! Har-har-har-ha! [Maniacal laughter and the twitching of fingers follows].  Seriously, Ailin, much appreciated. Drop us a line if you read this. Until then kiddies, visit her  urlLink website  and  urlLink weblog  and let her know how amazingly cool she is.   Moving on to the important stuff… Finally, the results of the last poll!    Who is -The Man?-   Whitey 130 (56%)   Jesus 6 (2%)   Whitey Pig Cops 8 (3%)   Ron Jeremy 17 (7%)   My mom, sadly. 69 (30%)   230 Total votes     Oh Jesus, you just couldn’t cut it this time, huh? Sadly, the Son of God himself couldn’t pull more than 2% of the overall vote. We tried to reach Mel Gibson for comment, but he was too busy counting the millions he made from preying on the devotion of the faithful to sell movie tickets to respond to our questions. Way to go Mel! If you’re such a good Christian, why don’t you donate all those profits from the “Passion” to charity? I’m sure that $200 million will help you buy a nice comfy Lay-Z-Boy at the right hand of Jesus when you’re finally called from this Earth, huh?  Does anyone honestly think it’s a coincidence that “Passion” was released around Ash Wednesday to coincide with the Easter season? That’s marketing, kids.   Coming in fourth was “Whitey Pig Cops,” which surprisingly only pulled 3% of the vote. I expected a little more voting love for the jerkoffs who continue to make the parking lots and side streets of the world safe with useless tickets while criminals are allowed to roam the streets raping, robbing and killing. Seriously. Ever see a bunch of cops eating lunch at a local restaurant, or grabbing coffee somewhere in the middle of the day? Ever want to just grab them by the throat and yell “Hey buddy, how about getting in your damn Pigmobile over there and SOLVING A FEW CRIMES WHILE YOU EAT THAT DANISH????” Ever want to slash the tires of a dumb-ass cop who’s pulled over someone for a minor traffic violation in the middle of rush-hour traffic, backing up cars for miles? Ever wonder why police only need a high school education to get a job? COPS ARE NOT YOUR FRIEND. THEY ARE NOT THERE TO PROTECT YOU. THEY ARE ONLY THERE TO PROTECT THE STATUS QUO.  Sorry, that wasn’t very funny. But I hate cops. Moving on.  In third place was my man, Ron Jeremy. Ron pulled 7% of the vote, beating Jesus by 11 votes, and again proving that Beer and Porn readers are the smartest readers of all. Ron Jeremy is the unsung hero of the American Porn Industry, which grosses more money per year than Hollywood. This is the honest truth. Pornography funnels millions of dollars in tax revenue into state and federal coffers every year, and silently allows media conglomerates to make profits. The porn industry is also responsible for many technological advances, such as the VCR, DVD, streaming video on the internet, encryption technology, and other high-tech methods of data transfer. Ron Jeremy, along with the other stars of the porn industry, we salute you! Not only did you get me through puberty, but you keep the American economy afloat! I’m going to celebrate with my Vivid DVDs…  In second place, we have your mom. I must say that I expected your mom to be the dark horse candidate, but she couldn’t put it all together in the end. I think we all know your mom’s qualifications in the area, and I think it’s safe to say that all of us here at Beer and Porn have an intimate relationship with your mom and her abilities. Your mom could be reached for comment, but we chose not to, because we aren’t interested in what she has to say, are we? We’re interested in what she can do…  Finally, the number one choice to the answer “Who is ‘The Man’?” – Whitey.  Speaking on behalf of Whitey, I’d like to make a brief acceptance speech.  I am probably the closest thing to the stereotypical Whitey that you can find. I’m white, for starters. Hopelessly white. Irish and Italian kind of white. Suburban Connecticut kind of white. Middle-middle class kind of white. Only child kind of white. The opposite of “diversity” kind of white. I put the “C” in Caucasian. I’m bland like Vanilla. I am the personification of Wonderbread. I fail to qualify for any scholarships. There are no outreach programs available to me. I am not protected by any equal opportunity mandates. I am not covered by any quotas. I am the reason for Affirmative Action. I have an albino soul. I am white.  I have been told from the day of my birth that I am bland and unoriginal. My ancestry is treated like potpourri trivia rather than a source of heritage or pride. My people, whoever they may be, are responsible for any and all social injustices you can find. I am responsible for slavery. I am responsible for patriarchy. I am responsible for the Jewish diaspora. I am responsible for the destruction of indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere. I am responsible for political lines in Africa and the Middle East that have destroyed tribes and caused civil unrest. I am the face of the Ku Klux Klan, of the Know-Nothing party, of National Socialism, of the Spanish Inquisition and untold other instruments of intolerance and cruelty. I am Big Tobacco. I am Big Government. I am Big Oil. I am Rich Uncle Pennybags, with a cigar in my mouth and a top hat on my head, running the world thanks to my white male privilege.  I am told that I run the show, and therefore I deserve no breaks. I am expected to prostrate repeatedly for the sins of my ancestors. I am afforded no breaks, no helping hands and no compassion. If I succeed, it is because of my white male privilege. If I fail, it is my fault and no one else’s. I am not allowed to enter into discourse about society, because my views are inherently racist, sexist, classist and bigoted. I am the personification of the sins of the world.   I am white. I am apparently “The Man.”   ---------------------  It’s difficult to talk about such things without exposing your shortcomings in reasoning due to your position in society. One could look at my social stature and claim that I am a perfect example of white privilege: well educated, self-sufficient, soon to receive my graduate degree and become a member of professional academia. You could say that I’ve never had to struggle to reach my goals, or fight preconceived notions of my abilities based on societal stereotypes. I certainly couldn’t argue with you – all I know is my own experience, and I can’t say whether my path has been eased by my skin color and gender. Some would say that is the case – and who am I to argue?  This I think is the point of my ridiculous rant above. It’s certainly fair to say that there are inherent social benefits to being male, or white, or both, in modern society. And it is just as important to expose these unfair advantages for what they are, as everyone should be afforded the same rights and opportunities in a truly free society. However, it often feels that as a member of white male America, I am immediately shut out of these discussions because of my perceived bigotry and/or involvement with the problems in society. Can a grown man speak about Feminism? Can a white man talk about racism? I’d like to think so – but in Politically Correct America, I’m afraid this may not be the case.  Anyways, on behalf of all Whiteys everywhere, I’d like to apologize. We’re trying our best to do the right thing. We’re just not all that good at it. Blame the fall of the Roman Empire. It messed us up pretty good, you know.  -Mr. Carson

       Dexter’s Random Topic for Me:  Attractivness and Why It’s Totally Fucked,   (or, “I like this porno, but there’s too much dick in it.”)    One of my good friends said something recently that has lodged itself inside of my brain.  He said, “I feel shallow by not being gay or bisexual.”  I was sort of confused by the statement, so I asked for a qualifying backup statement, which he delivered in mildly slurred speech, “Well… it bothers me that somebody could possess all of the qualities I look for in someone I would want in a romantic partner, funny, good taste in music… perfect compatibility…  and yet I would ignore them as a possible mate simply because it was a dude.”    	So I began to think about it, being confident in my own sexuality… and he’s got a point.  Why does gender play such a critical role in what’s attractive?  I mean, think about it.  If you were living with Marvin instead of Mary, you could watch Sportscenter without getting a healthy dose of Lifetime Movie network during the commercial break.  Marvin wouldn’t ask you what you thought about floral or printed curtains, or what you were thinking, period.  And deciding on whether to spend a weekend looking for deals at the Christmas tree shops or watching the Bond marathon and eating five successive meals at Wendy’s… no contest.   For mine own part, my brain is wired in a more traditional fashion.  Boys want to stick and girls want to be stuck. Tab A, Slot B… separated locker rooms, call me old guard, call me chauvinist… whatever.  That’s the way I see it.  This is not to say that I am not totally accepting of other ways of being.  I’m generally very laid back about that sort of thing, because, shit… it isn’t hurting me, is it?  But my buddy’s drunken and philosophical comment made me stop and think about the whole male female matchup.  So here goes.  	Let’s face it.  Girls are crazy.  And not funny crazy like that homeless dude who tells his shopping cart about the governmental conspiracies… they’re crazy crazy.  The face painting, the shaving, the plucking, the morning ritual… the need for shoes.  Stand back and look at it from a detached, clinical perspective.  If she doesn’t want to talk, don’t bother.  If she’s giving you the silent treatment, you Did Something.  It’s best to close your eyes and ignore the wrath… because, for some reason, she’ll just be like, “I love you so much!”  and you’ll do it like a million times.  And you are left with nothing but terrifying confusion, and the latent fear that you will someday do something to make her go away forever, and you’ll never have any idea what it is.  That’s crazy.  	But let us also face another fact.  Girls are hot.  Damn hot… Real hot.  Scampering about in bathing suits and smiling… Jesus!  It’s a beautiful thing.  And it’s not just the supermodels; Even real life girls are hot.  Furrowing their brows, trying to understand some chemistry formula, shopping on Saturday with a t-shirt and jeans… they sway, they recline… they can contort themselves on easy chairs and fall asleep with their legs tucked under… like sexy little cats, or otters or something.  It’s quite wonderful.    	I don’t know what they see in guys.  The non supermodel forms of maledom are an unruly lot.  Leaving seats up, sniff testing underwear for second and third day use, sweat, hair, snoring, Defiled bathrooms… We’re slobs.  And as my man Holden Caulfield said, the ones who look good on the outside are secret slobs.  Bed’s made every day, but look underneath… pizza boxes?  Using a mountain dew can for an ashtray for a month and a half.  Dusting?  Isn’t that how they administer pesticides to crops?  It’s a fact… we’re kinda gross.  And by kinda, I mean Really Really.   	So, how can normal girls be so hot, and normal guys be so disgusting?  How does anything get done in this whacked out gene pool?  So I sat, and I thought for another little while. no more than twenty seconds or so...  And it occurs to me that we hetero males often put women on pedestals.  Despite their craziness, they really can’t do wrong.  It’s like they’re aliens or something, and we’re all paunchy versions of Captain Kirk, Kicking ass and teaching them our ways of love.  They don’t poop, they don’t smell, they don’t sweat (they glow!).  Because they’re so mysterious, we think they’re not disgusting.   But… they are.  Girls are just sneaky.  And we men are willfully ignorant about it.  We block out those feminine hygiene commercials which seem to be misplaced during cool shows.  Blue liquid?  I can think of another primary color that might be a bit more apropos, considering the subject matter.  ‘Not so fresh feelings’?  It makes me wonder about what goes on inside the ladies’ room.  And here’s another little bit of info that came to my wide eyed attention, thanks to Sex and the City and nominally trustworthy females… girls talk about sex All The Time.  When we’re not around, of course.  And the DETAIL!  God Damn!  The way I’ve heard it told, it goes down to thrusts per minute, complete with elaborate and terrifying rating systems.  If you have ever had sex with a girl and she managed to escape your bedroom (or bathroom stall) alive, there is a group of women who you’ve probably seen at parties who know every detail of your sexual methods.  Big Brother may or may not be watching, but Big Sister is a horrifying reality.  And she has a notebook.  	I’m not sure where this is going… I barely remember where it started.   *pause for scrollup*   Ok.  MY buddy’s drunken commentary on sexuality.  I’m afraid I’ve gone on  a bit of a rant that has to do with it only tangentially, so I’ll try to wrap up.  Guys are straightforwardly gross, and see girls as statuesque psychopaths.  We are far too foolish and shortsighted to realize the awful truth.  Girls are sneakretly gross, and are realistic enough to know that real life guys don’t have chiseled faces and six pack abs, or if they do, they will someday fade into jowls and a soft beer belly.  I’ can’t really say one way or another about dude/ dude and chick/ chick attraction, but it is reasonable to postulate that they follow a somewhat similar formula.  So in the end, we’re all disgusting… but the important part is that we’re all disgusting together.  Somewhere in the genetic soup we call this island Earth, we manage to find our way, and someday wake up next to a form that we find pleasant.  Cheers, kids…   -The Slater

       Wannabe Quitter: This is a cry for help     Ever tried.  Ever failed.  No matter.  Try again.  Fail again.  Fail better.  -- Samuel Beckett    To begin, I have a request/’informercial’ for all you non-smoking “winners” out there…   Don’t give me any more crap about quitting smoking.  I’ve heard enough of it.  Honestly. I’ve said this 1000 times before – Quitting smoking is harder than many non-smokers would believe… maybe a doctor’s note will get your attention…  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  “'Nicotine is  highly addictive , to a degree similar or in some respects  exceeding  addiction to 'hard' drugs such as  heroin  and  cocaine'   - Source "Nicotine Addiction In Britain"  Report by Royal College Of Physicians – London  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  That’s right –  friggin’ heroin …    Back off.   In fact, the only drug more addictive than nicotine is cocaine – which is, in fact, the most addictive substance known to man.   Non-smokers seem hell-bent on enlightening all of us idiot smokers as to the dangers of our vice. Here’s a bit of  urlLink truth  for you…  70 percent of smokers  want to quit . Only about 5% actually succeed every year. Every year, 95% of people who try to stop smoking are not successful…  I’ll say that last one again…   95% of people who try to stop smoking are not successful.   Give me a break. It’s fucking hard… and “Nic Fits” aren’t the worst of the withdrawl symptoms… that’s right – symptoms plural… Here’s a chunk from the laundry list of withdrawl symptoms:   fatigue, lack of concentration, irritability, depression, anxiety, insomnia, (and an increased tendency to dream… which actually isn’t bad at all – sorry for wasting your time with that one), headaches, sleep disturbances, and increased appetite. These symptoms may begin within a few hours after the last cigarette. Symptoms peak within the first few days and may subside within a few weeks. For some people, however, symptoms may persist for months or longer... Oh and indigestion, nausea, diarrhea and sore throats…yes…  all of them at the same time .   There you go, eh? Ain’t THAT a bitch…  And that’s just the physical repercussions.  A number of smokers are addicted to the ritual of smoking - the feel, smell, and sight of a cigarette and the ritual of obtaining, handling, lighting, and smoking the cigarette are all associated with the happy times that smoking brings and can make withdrawal or craving worse. While nicotine gum and patches may alleviate the pharmacological aspects of withdrawal, cravings often persist. In other words, the patch and gum won’t work for some…  at all.  Fun, eh?  And, believe it or not, most of us smokers are hip to this jive. We know well enough what smoking does to us because… well we’re living the dream, kids. We also have intimate knowledge of how hard (damn near impossible) it is to quit smoking because… well most of us have tried and failed numerous times. So to you non-smokers who are harping on us to “just quit”, give it a rest already. Your constant bleatings aren’t helping. We’re wrestling with forces all but unknown to you – your efforts are certainly appreciated but… well damn… leave us alone. We’ll get there… your pressure isn’t helping at all. There… all done with that  :::adjusting tie:::  :::stepping down from soapbox:::  This whole deal is really about my latest failed quitting smoking effort. About two months ago I decided to give it the ol’ college try and clear the air. And, believe it or not, I was doing pretty good for a while there. My plan this time (probably gleaned from some online remedy mag or some such)  was to keep a diary recording each and every cigarette that I smoked – that’s right… every one… time, date, and, get this, motivation… awww yeah! I thought keeping a diary would be encouraging, you know? I’d see my smoking decreasing over time and get a confidence boost. ‘least that’s how it was supposed to work. I printed my quit date in HUGE letters and numbers on the front of the damn thing and, for a while, I was excited about the prospect of being smoke free. Then.. well things fell apart. Here… take a look…    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Feb 22 or 2.22.04    Day 1   	 10:01 AM   …by the microwave clock. First smoke of the day. Quitting smoking IS a pretty daunting task... but… I think I can I think I can.. gonna try and get Scotty to join me. Maybe the Squatch? I think he’ll quit if I quit 1:38 PM Smoke #2 before I go to play D2 w/Ed. Played a fair amount of guitar – felt good. A possible distraction from precious sweet nic-o-teen?  	 3:12 PM  My jaw hurts? Had a beer and feel like a smoke. Much easier to say “yes” after a beer… (noted)  	 7:?? PM  Smokey-poo as I took out the trash and headed to pick up an application and some namby-pamby soda… ugh… isn’t beer enough? Damn you…:::reading bottle::: …coca-cola.  	 10:14 PM  Excited! Only 5 [smokes] in twelve hours. I swore I was much worse off. This may be easier than I thought…  	 1:55 AM  Smoking w/Sasquatch… I find if I drink or stay up too late, I smoke more… I know I know… lemme tackle ONE vice @ a time    Day 2   	 7:05 AM  Slept like an ANGEL! Man-oh-man! Smokey-poo! More guitar planned today along w/some toolin’ around “Sasquatch Style”. Should be fun. Yesterday? 6 smokes in 16 hours. I think I can match that or do better.  	 10:40 AM  Put off smoking for 40-60 min after I wanted one. Tension, thy name is Nicotine Deprivation. Time for a smoke. Es la hora del fumar. 	 1:20 PM  After a nap (good sleep) had a smoke.- no more afternoon naps. It’ll probably help my sleep schedule. 	 3:53 PM  basically 4 PM… smoke break from D2 – gotta get some guitar in at some point… quitting smoking shouldn’t come with guilt… 	   Day 3   	 7:36 AM  Ok.. guitar is definitely a distraction from smoking. I’ve decided to go regimental and break down my technique… namely chord shapes. 	 8:30 PM  Prolly gonna have one on the way to get The Slater… I’ll get an estimation down when I get back. Hand hurts a little but good hurtin’… from guitar… I swear… :::shame::: 	 3:30 AM  Total of 4… Stressful event… no more smokes… is that a good thing?... Squatch has some… I’ll limit my bumming :::sleep::: 	   Day 4   	 11:30 AM  Up by 10:10 – First smoke of the day. Might be goin’ to see Scotty or Bren today. Win-win the way I see it. 	 1:30 PM  Smoke 	 5:30 PM  Smoke 	 7:45 PM  Smoke 	 11:45 PM  Smoke 	 2:00 AM  Smoke    Day 5  	 10:00 AM  First smoke – expecting some stress today. Hope it doesn’t up the smoke count. What can I use as a counter? 	 1:42  … OK OK… I went overboard a little. Got to bed by 11 though… that’s good.    Day 6   	 8:55 AM  Been up since 7:30… Made myself get plenty of sleep. Put off first smoke until now. Seeming very possible to quit for good 	 10:45 AM  Back… my back… smoke… lay down 	 1:39 PM  Smokey-poo! Bored out of my mind 	 5:58 PM  Smoke… 3?! WOW! :::happy::: 	 9:09 PM  Don came by… smokey-poo 	 10:30 PM  Don is still here… … smokey-poo!!    Day 7   	4 smokes in here somewhere… I was out all day    Day 8   	No smokes until 7ish (PM). GO Drew GO, eh? Went to Scotty’s and had 3… habit. Hope for tomorrow… one more before bed makes 5… again.    Day 9   	 11:36 AM  Smoke… been slacking on the whole journal deal. I’ll put a stop to that…    Day 13   	 11:15 AM  …yeah… I know… slacker… but one today so far… I think I may just have to cut myself off and deal… food and working out will help…    Day 14    	Superbowl Sunday  :::’nuff said:::    Day 15   	1st smoke @ noon… that’s kinda good, eh?   Then… there is what I have figured to be a random drunken scrawling by me which reads… Your pussy smells like (frat) gin, whore   …:::???:::    Final Entry   	 Failed  though my sex drive is through the goddamn roof… ‘least my body is happy to have felt alive, eh?  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   So what happened, you ask?  :::deep breath:::  …lack of concentration, irritability, depression, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, sleep disturbances, and increased appetite. indigestion, nausea, diarrhea…  …yeah – all of that while the rest of life was chugging right along. Talk about frustrating. Something happened, though, that made me rethink quitting altogether.  I was at work and a man came up to the counter. He looked like he had been in a washer and dryer set to “Old” for most of his life. One of the two of his yellowing eyes was split open a bit at the bottom and :::gag::: it was oozing thick yellowish… schtuff.  :::Christ:::  Oh but it gets better. He had SEVERAL holes in his neck and to talk to me he had to use one of those doohickeys that makes folk sound like Robot Jones. On top of all of this, he only had enough breath to utter one word at a time. He used what could have very been the last of his breaths to say these three words…  Skoal…  …Wintergreen…  …Longcut…  :::SHIT!:::  Now THAT’S a fucking addiction.   (note: Skoal is smokeless or ‘chewing’ tobacco – Wintergreen is a flavor they offer and longcut is one of two varieties of Skoal[the other being ‘fine cut’] … thus Skoal Wintergreen Longcut is what he was asking for – visit http://www.ussmokeless.com/ for more info)   I’ve done some pretty terrible things in my lifetime but damn it if this wasn’t one of the absolute worst… I sold it to him. Every part of me knew that it was wrong to do so… that I should have said “no” and let myself be fired or just quit on the spot or something… anything demonstrating a little moral backbone. But no, I sold it to him and got regret and nightmares in return.  After that, I started to notice more and more how many people come in for their fix of nicotine – people with sickly eyes yellowing fingernails and brown teeth… people breathing heavier than any pedophile or phone sex operator could ever dream… people carrying the sick stink of tobacco… dead people really. A third of the people I’ve sold that shit to will die from it. These are people who otherwise lead normal lives. These are people who started smoking to piss off their parents or because their brother did or to fit in with the cool kids or any other number of reasons. These are people, most of them, who don’t want to be there… standing in front of me and asking for death… People tired of being a slave to a few ounces of dried leaves.. These people don’t want to smoke.  I remember back to those bullshit drug education courses in grades 1-12… I remembered all the bogus reports we had to do and all the little factoids we had to swallow and regurgitate on paper. I remember mostly how smoking was never made out to be a big deal. Heroin, coke, speed, PCP… hell… even alcohol and marijuana… THOSE were the bad guys. Tobacco was just their naughty underling… a clever parrot on the shoulder of a big bad pirate.  …right.  :::shaking head:::  I haven’t yet given up on quitting smoking. I’ll make it soon enough. Picking up smoking was a huge mistake that me and millions of other people have made. We had no idea what we were getting into and, what with social whatnots being what they are, smoking is ok… even cool. It is… honestly. Imagine James Dean without one… see?  Anywho, I’m actually gonna go have a cigarette. Not only for the sake of irony but also… well… I’ll fucking bite the head off of a nun if I don’t suck down some poison. This one’s for you, weird eye dying guy… I’ll quit for both of us.  -- Dexter Otis Green

       I Believe in Santa: My Secret Shame   A few years ago, I was sweating out a gorgeous fall day in the stands of Memorial Stadium (RIP) with 249 of my closest friends. One friend in particular had been telling some interesting stories (lies, I called them) and today was the day of proof. I’d heard a million whoppers and tall tales:   “My dad is the President of Reebok”  “I just signed with Virgin Records”  ”I’m pregnant”  But I think this kid took the cake with this particular unbelievably outrageous bullshit story.  ”My Dad is Santa Claus”   …  (see the archives for my feelings on Christmas)  …  :::share my rage:::   HA! – Santa isn’t real! Period!... and this kid was gonna pay for his lies. He must have meant that his dad  looked  like Santa… ‘cause there was no way in his Pop was the genuine article. This day, I waited like a bear-trap to meet Santa. Believe or not, this wasn't the first time I had waited for the man.  When I was a kid, I remember waiting on Christmas Eve at my bedroom window for Father Christmas. I waited until I fell asleep with my cheek and ear pressed against the frosted window pane. I wanted to see him… just once. Waking up the next morning and seeing presents wasn’t enough for me. I needed to see him with my own eyes. But, alas, it was not yet to be. I lost all faith in Santa. As far as I was concerned, my mother and father bought the presents. And that was fine by me.  This day at a football game in Memorial Stadium would be different. The kid pointed over to where his parents were sitting. My eyes scanned the crowd past a million sets of ice blue eyes and graying beards… my gaze tumbled over hundreds of bellies that’d shake like a bowl full of jelly but… none of them Santa-like.  And then it happened like it always does. My eyes stopped moving before I had known that I had found him and there he was. I couldn’t believe it! There, sitting in the bleachers with a snow white beard and a yule log smile was friggin’ Santa Claus. This was bullshit!. Part of me hastened to explain it away.   “He dressed up a little more like Santa today to fool you- to make you believe – he knows the stories. He’s just living up to them!”   But he wasn’t dressed in anything particularly Santa-ish. I knew it was him, though. I knew. And then he started waving a big glove in one hand, the other arm wrapped around Mrs. Claus  (oh yeah.. she was there too… and she’s crazy hot!... I actually wrote a song about it… but that’s another story, isn’t it Jake)  and I swear to God, I blinked harder than I may have ever blinked in my life.  It WAS him.  I’ve believed since. Even before I scrambled over aluminum benches and concrete stairs to meet him, I knew it was him. Now for a guy who’s always calling for evidence, it’s downright hypocritical of me to make a claim as big as this one without one single shred of evidence.   But you haven’t met him.  Once you meet him, you’ll believe. He has something that none of those bullshit Mall Santas and run-of-the-mill big jolly old guys don’t have. I don’t know what it is, man, but it’s there.   Something about those eyes… he has the look of a kid who’s been playing in the snow all day. And when he talks, it’s always like story time…like drinking hot chocolate… like listening to all the greatest oldest stories you’ve ever heard all at once… and with arms like that, the man could friggin’ punch a hole in the Pope – no question… smart money says he can bench at least 350…   …sorry ladies… he’s taken...  I made friends with Santa and it’s been nothing but good times ever since. He promised me some Clementine Oranges and  Leer jet… not bad, eh? Tip for all you would be Santa pals..  There is no limit to the amount of tequila this man can put away.  :::hangover:::   That about does it – Santa is a very real person. All the holly jolly whatnots we heard as kids turned out to be true. Call me insane if you want – I know that you don’t know any better so I’ll forgive you. Besides, who cares what you think.  I believe in him.    --  Dexter Otis Green

      Hello again all you BeernPornophiles! It’s been a long, long time since my last post, and there’s been a lot of changes in the world of Mr. Carson – not the least of which is the addition of a Mrs. Carson. Yes, I have been emasculated at the altar of holy sacrament and public policy, and my rights and powers as a single male in American society have been stripped by a cruel and unforgiving mistress who used the promise of guaranteed intimacy to lure me into her evil estrogen prison of monogamy and reproduction. Zounds!   But enough of my troubles. I’ll speak of love and marriage another time. Right now, there is a more pressing issue that I need to speak about. It is an issue that threatens to tear apart the very social fabric of this great country. It’s a lifestyle choice that is being forced upon us everywhere we look, in our towns, cities, neighborhoods and places of business. It is a deplorable, immoral attitude towards acceptable social behavior, and it must be stopped.  Worst of all, it has its roots in France.  What am I speaking of, you ask? I can sum it up in one simple sentence.  [ahem]  …  …   YOU ARE NOT LANCE ARMSTRONG .       See that photo? That is  Lance Armstrong, 5-time Tour De France winner, all-American hero, world-class cyclist, model athlete and cancer survivor.   This is you:           ...  Again, Lance Armstrong:      I’d like you to notice a few important points about Lance Armstrong:  1)	He’s a professional athlete, which is clear from his professional sponsorship (U.S. Postal Service) 2)	Being a professional athlete, he wears performance equipment for his cycling competitions. His lycra uniform is made to increase his aerodynamic profile, allowing him to reach faster speeds with less effort. 3)	He has the chiseled jaw and smooth, powerful musculature of a  MAN WHO HAS SURVIVED CANCER.   Now, a few important points about you:      1)	You are NOT a professional athlete, which is clear from your COMPLETE LACK OF PROFESSIONAL SPONSORSHIPS. Just because you have “Huffy” written across the ass of your spandex racing pants does not mean you are PAID TO WEAR THE LOGO. 2)	 Not being a professional athlete, you have NO REASON to wear performance-enhancing equipment. If I wanted to, I could walk my fat couch-potato ass down to the Sports Authority, buy a helmet, shoulder pads and cleats. I could even get the helmet spray painted with the New England Patriots logo if I wanted to, and buy myself a Richard Seymour jersey. Does this make me a NFL Defensive End? FUCK NO. It makes me an asshole with a Patriots helmet on.  3)	You have the unshaven jaw and light skin tone of a PERSON WHO WORKS IN A CUBICLE ALL DAY. Note the complete lack of overcoming any life-threatening illness. Important note – riding for a cancer charity DOES NOT EQUATE YOU WITH A CANCER SURVIVOR.    YOU ARE NOT LANCE ARMSTRONG.   Most of us would like to think that we are original, that we have original ideas, original interests and original outlooks on life, society and spirituality. Sadly, you are mistaken. We all are, in fact. Anything you do, say, think, write, draw, paint, create, sing, create or destroy has easily been done hundreds of times over in the past – and is probably being done right now. Even those dirty little sexual pastimes you engage in when no one’s around are – sadly – nothing new. The best we can hope for is to belong to a smaller group of similar-minded zombies than the next door neighbor, as that may afford you a certain measure of self-confidence as you delude yourself into thinking you are a paragon of originality.  Oh I see, so you’ve actually been a fan of Texas Hold-‘em Poker your entire life, huh? Suuuuuuure. Like you even knew what the fuck a “flop” was until the World Series of Poker started to run on repeat play on ESPN2.       This might be you – if you replaced the pile of cash with a bag of Chee-tos, the poker chips with pennies and nickels, and the casino with your dorm room. I’LL SEE YOUR PENNY AND RAISE YOU A DIME! NO LIMIT, WOO HOO!!  Anyways, back to the bikers. I have absolutely no problem with bicycles. They’re a marvelous invention, they serve a practical purpose, and they represent a health-conscious and environmentally friendly method of public transportation. Plus, they’re a fond reminder of the joys of youth, when whole weeks could be wasted riding your bike with your friends through the dirt paths of the woods behind your house, or the streets around your neighborhood. Bikes are cool.  You, sadly, are not.  Much like the poker craze sweeping the sexually inactive twentysomething population like the Dungeons and Dragons of yore, bicycle riding is becoming the recreation of choice for young professionals, thanks to the success of Lance Armstrong and the popularity of the Tour de France on national TV. Oh wait, sorry, it’s “cycling.” You’re not riding a bike, you’re “cycling,” and “cycling” requires training and skill, right? It also requires a bike worthy of your athletic prowess, right? One with thirty-three gears, swept-back grips, sweat-resistant seats and aerodynamic fins around the handlebars, right? And let’s not forget the skin-tight lycra bodysuit, and the aerodynamic polypropylene helmet, and the professional racing gloves, and the Nike performance cycling sneakers, and the water bottle full of performance enhancing hydrating sports drink from GNC, right? It’s only the best for Mr. Cyclist, right?  Yet somehow, with all the professional equipment and the performance-enhancing clothing, you still manage TO CLOG UP THE ENTIRE FUCKING ROAD WITH YOUR SLOW ASS.      Notice that none of these people are LANCE ARMSTRONG. Notice how none of them are racing in the TOUR DE FRANCE. Yet notice how they seem perfectly content keeping the motorist behind them blocked from utilizing the roadway. I’m sure those streamlined helmets help to increase your max speed to 9 MPH, but you mind getting out of the MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING ROAD please?  I’m sure that some of you were “cycling enthusiasts” long before Lance’s historic feats, but I guarantee that 95% of the cockwads I see on the roads every day in their one-step-away-from-fetish-quality latex racewear clogging up my daily commute are Lance-o-philes who only started riding their bikes around like little kids in the past few years.  Please.  Here’s a few important points to remember next time you plan on going for a bike ride:  1)	Unless you are competing in an official race, leave the spandex at home. 2)	Sadly, no matter how hard you try, you are slower than motorized vehicles. Therefore, please try your hardest to STAY OUT OF THE FUCKING ROAD. It’s called a “shoulder.” Stay on it. 3)	The Department of Motor Vehicles, along with the Police Department, treats bicycles the same as motorized traffic. This means a cyclist must follow ANY AND ALL TRAFFIC DIRECTIONS AND SIGNS. This means you STOP at a RED LIGHT. This means you YIELD at a YIELD SIGN. This means you STAY WITHIN THE YELLOW LINES. This means the next time you weave your bike through traffic at a busy intersection in front of my car and run the red light, cutting off cars and stopping traffic a mile down the road, I will calmly leave my vehicle and administer a STATE-SPONSORED BEATDOWN OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS on your ass. 4)	Whether you work in a factory, an office building or a Taco Bell, you have a uniform you have to wear to work. Overalls, power suit or smock, it’s all the same when you break it down. There is no job in the world other than the job of BEING LANCE ARMSTRONG that requires you to wear a BRIGHT YELLOW SPANDEX SUIT to work in. Walking in to work at the beginning of your shift in “cycling gear” does not make you cool. It makes you an outcast, and guarantees you a stoning at the hands of your co-workers straight out of a Shirley Jackson short story.  Bike riding can be a fun and rewarding exercise. Unless you are blocking my car from driving at state-sponsored speeds. Then it becomes a life-or-death situation for you.  Remember,  YOU ARE NOT LANCE ARMSTRONG.    Leave the cycling to people who know what they’re doing.  And get out of my way.  -Mr. Carson

      Alrighty.  Sunday has come and gone. Let’s recap.  I finished off “The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon”. Not King’s best but certainly a winner. Picked up Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and started digesting that parchment truffle. Wandered around Boston for about 4 hours with a friend (Colin – yes he is… no we didn’t – shame on you) who showed me a great many of Boston’s offerings. After scarfing more BK, I headed back to the apt and tried in vain to porn surf without a mouse. I’m telling you now it’s damn near impossible… damn near…  [ahem]  After that little adventure, Sean stopped over and we played and sang on my roof for a while. You know, the little things ear making this whole move worth while – singing at the top of my lungs on a foreign roof veiled in cigarette smoke, warm tar underfoot with unlearned strangers undoubtedly mumbling anonymous critiques, laughing at the sky for no damn reason, daring the clouds to rain on that perfect setting… [sigh]  Magic.  We ambled in shaking with equal parts laughter and cold – Boston had been playing it cool all afternoon and it was time for yours truly to get indoors. Inside? We chatted for a while and then went mouse hunting. [note: I forgot my mouse and have been using nothing but keyboard commands] By then it as close to 9pm and, wouldn’t you know, there were no mice to be had.   An ATM beckoned nonetheless and Sean and I decided it would make a perfect studio. We made ourselves right at home amidst the eggshell flood lights and pea-green monitors. I got a very quick guitar lesson before the ATM room was filled with patrons who apparently didn’t agree with our studio idea. Undaunted and armed with Sean’s Ibanez, we made grand fools of ourselves traveling the streets of Boston improving blues [Anybody Got Drawz fo’ Lease?] and generally jarring the drowsy public with Sean’s great guitar and my shameless singing. Somehow we made it across street and past several cock-eyed passersby and settled on my stoop. Chilled but triumphant, we climbed the stairs to my apartment babbling in the language of satisfied men.  Once inside, we chatted the night away – light fare really; God, the universe, and everything. Before too long, the digital clock bade Sean home and, after walking him down, I headed up to be alone in my palace.  It simply does not get better than this.

      So here I am in Boston’s Back Bay area just a stone’s throw away from the from the famed Jillian’s and a drunken quarter-mile stumble from Copley Square. Fenway is within shouting distance, The Boston Conservatory is literally across the street, and the Prudential Building vies for my attention amidst a sea of various apartment building and hostels outside my window.  Beantown, baby. F’ing fabulous.  I guess I should start from the beginning of all of this...  About a week ago I was working at my deluxe-all-time-sweet job at the XxtraMart when I get a phone call. “How’d you like to live in Boston for the summer and play with my band for free?”, came the phone on the other end. My best friend was ecstatic with the news and I stood there with the receiver to my ear bleating “yes” like a bored chick getting dry humped by some ne’er-do-well in the back seat of a beaten sedan at the drive in.  Money.  This is what I had been waiting for. An unbelievable opportunity had just fallen into my lap and I wasn’t about to turn it down. I hung up the phone after making him promise to fill me in on the details when I got back to my apartment and spent the rest of my shift with a $1,000,000 smile and an erection that only a well worn hooker could love. A week later, my crap backed into so many bags and/or flung carelessly into the trunk of my roommates car, I scurried up to Boston sporting the same unbelievable thumper.  I met my buddy outside of the New England Conservatory and we ferried him over to what was to be my apartment. After 30 min of one-way street denials, we finally pulled up to a modest five-story yellow painted brick building. We carried my crap up the 4 flights of stairs to the top floor, piled it onto the couch, and, after a few brief words and some gas money, my ride headed for the hills. Sean suggested I head over to his place to hang out and well by gosh golly gee I did. We hopped the T (train) and I spent the night playing guitar and generally catching up with Sean. Morning came and I rode the T back to my part of town so that I could get my things organized.  Things took a turn.  On the way to the T the night before, we took a roundabout route that led us to some quality dining at Burger King (sweet!). Needless to say, I couldn’t just retrace my steps from the night before. But so what! I confidently stepped off of the train saddled with my trombone and a newly acquired GUI-tar and started hoofing in the general direction of my apartment.  After about 10-15 min, I found the street I live on but, wouldn’t you know it, that fucker was long! I knew I was close to my apartment but I didn’t know whether it was to the left or to the right. Whatever. I was in a dandy mood and took my chances heading left. 6 blocks of unfamiliar territory changed my mind and, making a quick pivot, I headed in the opposite direction. That way lead to the same “I don’t know’s” and I found myself lost. What a fucking tourist. Luckily, I spied a pair of Boston’s finest, and, after some debate, shambled over to them burdened with the instruments.  And that’s when it happened.  “Hey guys, I’m lost”, is all I said. The response? “You lookin’ for the Boston Symphony?” said the lady cop... in Boston-ese. I was thrilled! My very first Boston accent! I stood there trying not to smile like a child-molester and hung on their every word. She and her likewise linguistically gifted chum pointed me in the right direction and finally, heaving and panting, I found my apartment.   Over the next few days, I was like a priest at an all-boys camp for the mute. I even got in touch with another friend of mine and had a couple beers in a sketchy ass Latino ghetto (in which I got lost).  Today? – I had French Toast and Meat (swear to god… that’s how it’s listed on the menu), finally got my computer up and running, finished a novel, smoked my weight in cigarettes, and rocked out hard on some guitar. I was in such a good mood, the gunshots in the alley outside my window hardly phased me!  I’m here for at least this summer but, hell, if things go well I wouldn’t be opposed to living in this town. So what if I have to spend part of my day dodging homeless panhandlers and partially-toothed Mexican psychopaths (true story). I’m in F’in’ Beantown, baby!

      How about that, eh?   Howdy Kids. I’d like to start of by giving a warm and heartfelt “bah humbug” to all you Christmas junkies. Happy Spending! I know it’s May but it’s never too late to share the hate... ... ... or is it too early...  ...[?]  [blink, blink]  ...  Secondly, I, like to welcome you all to the second installment of   Vituperation and Me ...  ...a series in which I plan to express my loathing for those who have worked so very hard at proving themselves worthy of my wrath; Gypsies, A&F employees, anyone who dresses as Santa for a living, Baby Jesus, handicapped children, Bob Ross (get out of my head!!), the blind and, of course, television, will all have a chance to stand before me to be judged. Rest assured that they will all be found guilty of stopping up the bowels of life with all their nonsense.    Once again I’d like to remind you all that a search for logic or reason amidst the ranting will do you no good. I can assure you, here and now, that you will find very little if any in what is written here. I do, however, promise to swear profusely and to encourage laughter at the expense of those that are infirmed and or otherwise beneath me.   First up was  Gary Busey . Feel free to   urlLink go back   to that essay and catch up if you must.  Now, however, it is time to move on to the next whore of life...  Stephen Hillenburg . May his children know always the deep love of a stranger from behind.   Bio, crime, sentence of:  Stephen Hillenburg - Creator of Sponge Bob Square Pants     Bio   It was an unusually warm and homoerotic August afternoon in 1961.  Big’ol Blue Hillenburg  (or "The guy who is totally not fucking queer" as he is known to his friends... "that guy" for short) wiped his sweaty heterosexual brow with the back of a calloused hand and stared into an Oklahoma sky shimmering with hectic heat. The town of Fort Sill had another son on the way and That Guy was nervous. Mind you his wife, Ima Scainkass-Hillenburg, was doing fine... physically that is.  That Guy wasn’t concerned about that for now. His wife, however, had been feeling strange for the past 3 months of her pregnancy. "Satan’s inside me!" and "I’m a goddamn nightmare bitch!!" and still "I’m the butt-fucking sponge that's here for your soul - Fist me! - Fist me now you sonofabitch!" were common exclamations heard from her in the middle of the night while she slept.  It wasn't long until her swollen belly brought forth a frothy and eager-cheeked baby boy. Spewing him from her loins onto the sun-warmed wooden kitchen floor, she sighed and dabbed a napkin at the meeting of her thighs. "It is finished", she groaned, and collapsed with a sick thud. Upon hearing the tell-tale plop that herald the birth of his son, That Guy bolted in from the thirsty fields and squinted down at the mass of blood and flesh that was his... son? Shrugging, he mumbled something along the lines of "probably queer" and demanded sustenance from his recently unburdened wife.   Growing up, young Hillenburg fell under the accusatory stare of his ill-tempered and oft abusive father - a father who’s only words to his soon were "queer" and "I should have made her swallow". Hillenburg's mother would only lay one arthritic index finger over another whenever he was foolish enough to come into her presence. She wanted nothing to do with the "demon boy". His only consolation during these troubling years were the solitary hours he spent scrubbing at the deep maroon stain his blue-white babe body (and subsequent fetus) had left on the kitchen floor. It was a stain that would never come out. Yet, at his father's insistence, he scrubbed away at the only mark he had ever left on the world. Nuzzling the sponge he'd come to love, he often dreamed of the day when he would be free to do as he wished; see the ocean, stay up past midnight, and maybe even get a job as a go-go dancer at Nipsy’s - Fort Sill Oklahoma's only gay night club.   Years passed and time brought Hillenburg an art teacher - Ms. Arva Sedinbaum. " It was a mistake ", she recounted in a 1999 interview with the Boston Globe. " How could I have known what would come of those lessons ?"  Young Hillenburg quickly developed a passion for the arts and excelled in his studies at Paul Lester High School. His quirky demeanor and wildly unique style soon drew attention from New York and Los Angles art colleges. Hillenburg was a hot item - particularly with his character "Rocko"- A hard-luck everyman wallaby. It seemed that his dreams of freedom were finally coming true.  Soon after college, Hillenburg's character Rocko was greenlighted for it’s own series -  Rocko's Modern Life . It was here that Hillenburg would truly shine. It was also here that the first of many downward spirals began.   Fame proved to be too much for Hillenburg and during the 3rd season of Rocko's Modern Life, he began experimenting with drugs. Whores and coke binges were the dominating factors in his life and with good reason - Hedonism suited him. "I've got more cooch than an abortion clinic", as he was often quoted saying proved to be true. But it was not to last.  A fateful evening in Chicago’s Coco-Bongo brought Hillenburg and LSD together for the first time. It was on this same night that he met the first of many of his secret lovers - Patrick Lindt. " I thought he was weird but I mean... we all were - I mean... [snort] that's just how things were. But the sponge? That fucked with me " Lindt bleated in a 2001 interview with the New York Times. Hillenburg has carried his childhood friend on all of his life's adventures. It was his totem - a super absorbent guru. And it was this very sponge that gave birth to his faggity future.  So strange, so unique, so... disgustingly annoying and just downright fucked up... uh... I mean spongy (read: catcher). SpongeBob was born during Hillenburg's two and a half year LSD/Special-K binge. And just who is this SpongeBob?  [ahem]  Deep down in the Pacific Ocean in the subterranean city of Bikini Bottom (read: homosexual paradise) lives a square yellow sea sponge named SpongeBob SquarePants. SpongeBob lives in a pineapple (read: phallus) with his pet snail (ditto), Gary, loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab (read: vagina is evil), and has a knack for getting into all kinds of trouble without really trying (read: caught giving bj's at truck stops). When he's not getting on the nerves of his cranky next door neighbor Squidward - (who himself is a homoerotica goldmine), SpongeBob can usually be found smack in the middle (read: three-way) of all sorts of strange situations (read: S&M/bondage fantasies) with his best buddy (read: lover), the simple yet lovable starfish (a creature composed entirely of phalluses) , Patrick, or his thrill-seeking surfer-girl squirrel pal (token gal pal who is 'totally not a lesbian'), Sandy Cheeks (read: carpet muncher). Stephen Hillenburg finally gave in to the whims of his psychotropic inductions and breathed life into this... fuckwad sponge. (remember - this is the same guy that brought us the totally un-faggy  urlLink Rocko’s Modern Life      Crime   This is the ex-biologist who created the "legend" (read: ubiquitous nightmare). SpongeBob started out as a sketch of a square sponge. Now SpongeBob is a cultural icon (read: flaming homosexual), and so is his creator (ditto). This is the bitch that ruined Nickelodeon (with the exception of  Nick at Night  - God Bless you, Family Ties reruns).  Clearly, he is the devil.  ...I said clearly, bitch!  [five across the eyes!]   Need more proof of his evil?  urlLink Listen to the Baptists .  There you go... if Baptists believe then it must be... I mean it's... it’s gotta be...  ok - so fuck them Baptists but, trust me, this fucker done did wrong.    Sentence   Kids... I'm at a loss here - really. I mean what can you do to repay the man who gave birth to the embodiment of evil? What would be appropriate compensation for foisting SpoogeBub SquealPants upon us? I mean... damn... for the first time,  I truly have no words .  [making note]  [collecting debts]   Help me out here, my fellow uterine evictees. Use the message boards. That's why they're there. Tell me, children. What must I do? Help me find an appropriate punishment for this bitch.     --Dexter Otis Green

      Well, I just got an email from the advocates of fair and equal time in political advertising saying that my previous piece "10 reasons why Nazis are better than Republicans" must be accompanied by a similar piece detailing the faults of the Democratic party so that the voters can have an informed ::cough, cough:: basis on making important ::cough, cough:: voting decisions.  So now, I present the companion article, all about why Democrats blow.    1) They hate successful people.  If you got rich in this country, you did so by exploiting the poor, women, and minorities.  They further spread their hatred by insisting that they be taxed much more highly from their patently ill-gotten gains to compensate for their evil oppression of all people.  2) They love taxes.  If they could tax you on the number of times you have sex per week, they would.  If they were fucking you in the asshole, they'd insist on paying an extra fee for giving you a reach-around.  They also love to spend the taxes they take from you.  If they can find a way to spend taxpayer dollars on useless programs, they spend it.    3) They talk all about how they're the party that cares about women, minorities, labor, and the poor.  Yet, when you see the roster of states that carry the most Democratic support, they're the states that are filled with the most rich white folks.  When you see a Democrat on the floor of Congress, or in the Presidency, the chances are almost inifinitely in favor of him being a rich white guy.  Even when you see them on political stops shaking hands and kissing babies, the hands and babies are almost universally white.  And usually men.  And probably rich.  4) They call themselves the party who loves the environment, and supports foreign aid for the development of the third world.  But tell them to stop drinking the Starbucks lattes, driving the gas guzzling Hummers from home to the corner grocery, wearing the sweatshop Nikes while playing tennis, and eating condor egg omelettes with spotted owl sausage, and they get all indignant.  5) They're in favor of personal freedoms, but watch get them get a big ol' legal hard on when some stoner gets caught with half an ounce of pot and gets sentenced to twenty years in prison.  They think anyone should be given a second chance to reclaim their broken lives if they get into prison, then they mandate that anyone convicted of a felony can't vote, or that getting convicted of a sexual crime means that they're put on a giant registry that can be accessed by anyone at any time, and that their neighbors need to be informed every second they take a step outside their front door.  6) They call themselves the "liberal" party, but condemn both socialism and laissez-faire economic policies.  In other words, they're liberals as long as you don't trouble yourself with any definitions of what "liberal" actually means.  7) They love having a big federal government, with lots of bureaucracy, which is responsible for most of the legislation and regulation of the government.  Because, you know, no horrifically tyrannical monarchy ever kept itself entrenched by having a massive system of bureaucrats and ministers centralized in one location, and a series of laws and regulations that were arcane and unreadable by anyone except themselves...   8) They're damned dirty evil commie librul hippies.  I know this directly contradicts several of my points above, but it needed to be said.    9) Did I mention taxes?  While I was typing the above 8 points, I had to pay fifty cents in tax to pay for some congressional kid's 10 pack a day Bazooka habit.  Or, more likely, to pay for his next junket to investigate the tourism trade in Barbados.  So, Democrats suck too.  If anyone needs more proof of this fact, remind yourself that the last three Democratic presidents were (1) a lying sleazeball from the South who cheated on his wife, abused the authority of his office, and that's before he even got into the White House, (2) a good ol' Southern boy who mired the country in its worst war ever, using an excuse flimsier than Victoria's Secret lingerie, and (3) a hopeless idealist who probably wouldn't have been able to even cut it as the president of a peanut farm.  And if you need more evidence: George McGovern.  Walter Mondale.  Michael Dukakis.  The defense rests.  The King, out!

      There.  Now that Godwin's Law has been invoked, we can get down to the serious business of: WHY REPUBLICANS SUCK!  Because they do.  I have met individual Republicans that are pretty nice people, but as a group, y'all suck.    Now, before all you rabid partisan watchdogs get ready to tear my larynx out for being an EVIL GODLESS COMMIE LIBRUL, bear in mind that I bear no party affiliation.  My voter registration card reads that I am a member of the "Unaffiliated" party.  A party which, as far as I know, holds no meetings, runs no candidates for office, and doesn't have a statement of purpose beyond apathy.  I do not hate Republicans because I am a Democrat, or a liberal, or any other group that might possibly bear resentment towards the GOP.  I hate them because they suck.    Let's run down some of the reasons:  1) They hate everyone that isn't a white, rich, Protestant, straight male.  Now, some of you are already champing at the bit, upon reading that last sentence, to respond with a comment like, "But I'm a woman and I'm a Republican", or "I'm black and I'm a Republican".  If you are anything but a white, rich, Protestant, straight male, you're deluding yourself if you identify with the Republican party or platform.  I say this secure in the knowledge that the governor of my state, a woman, and the US Secretary of State, a black man, are successful and fairly respected members within the Republican party.  They may look, on the outside, to be something other than the average Republican, but on the inside beats the heart of a white, rich, Protestant, straight male.    If you don't fit one of the five categories above, the Republican party hates you.  They hate poor people, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, Catholics, Muslims, women, and gay people.  God help you if you're a poor, Jewish, black, lesbian.  2) They think that God should be everywhere in government.  God has no place in government, and despite what you may think about ambiguous statements like "endowed by their Creator" in our founding documents, the Founding Fathers thought so as well.  The Ten Commandments are not the precepts by which we establish our laws and determine our moral guidance, nor is teaching divine creation the sole legitimate means of educating children about the universe, nor is God Bless America anything but a song written for the propagandistic war films of the World War II era.    3) They think that sex and sexual discussion should be kept as quiet as possible, and preferably to not even happen.  They deny the overwhelming evidence that (1) sex is a NECESSARY biological function that each member of the species is driven to perform at least once, and hopefully as often as possible, and that (2) EVERYONE FUCKS.  They believe that abstinence is the only policy worth a fuck (pardon the pun), that sex should only be between a man and a woman who love each other, and only in the bonds of holy matrimony, and that no one should know that anyone ever used their genitals for any other purpose than peeing.  Likewise, they are in favor of free speech as long as it's not about sex, doesn't use dirty words, and doesn't contain any offensive thoughts or ideas (read: anything they disagree with).    4) They believe in the sanctity of life, that fetuses should be allowed to be born and have the chance at life, and that all people who are sick and infirm should allow nature to take its course, saying that abortion and euthanasia are actions that "mess up God's plan".  They also see nothing wrong with messing up God's plan by taking the lives of criminals via the death penalty.    5) They ignore that this country was founded on the backs of cheap immigrant labor and people escaping shitty economic and political situations in denying the rights of Africans, Mexicans, Chinese, Vietnamese, Cubans and Haitians the right to do the same.    6) They think Canada and Australia aren't really real countries, that the rest of Europe should listen to us because we bailed their asses out in World War II, and that since we're the most powerful country in the world, everyone should do what we say.  They also believe that in this post-colonial political environment that the Monroe Doctrine (and the Roosevelt Corollary) have any real meaning anymore.  7) They think that all Muslims act and think the same, that Islam is a religion of hate and violence, and that the reason Muslim terrorists hate us is because of our freedom and prosperity.  They also thought the same things about Communists and Nazis.  8) They actually believe that the "us vs. them" and "if you're not for us, you're against us...if you're not a part of the solution you're a part of the problem" mentalities are anything other than false dichotomies.  9) Did I mention that they hate gay people?  It's apparently important enough for me to mention it twice in this list, since they feel it's important enough to write a fuckin' constitutional amendment about.  10) They actually think that Fox News is fair and balanced, that CNN and MSNBC are part of the "liberal media conspiracy", and that Rush Limbaugh is anything other than a big fat idiot addicted to painkillers.  11) Newt Gingrich.  Enough said.  So, that's enough reasons, I feel, why Republicans suck.  They would suck and blow at the same time, twere it possible. But they're not the only ones...

      Whoa there, pilgrims... hold the phone...   I was minding my own damn niggerish business today doin' niggerish things in my niggerish apartment when, all of a sudden, BOOM! I get an email. Beer 'n' Porn had been updated!   Praise Satan!   What with my band committments and the other BnP staff's school/job committments, I hadn't planned on seeing anything new in the BnP universe until September or so. But, clearly, I had been mistaken! Marvelous! Now let's see what we have  urlLink here ...   [reading]   ...   ...wow    Alright first things first. As a rule, the only BnP staffer I've ever personally attacked even tangentally has been  urlLink Mr. Carson . He deserves it. He's a heterosexual middle class white american male... which means he's just  got  to be evil. And so far, he was my target when I needed one...   ..until I read  urlLink this masterpiece .   After I cleaned up my vomit and stopped myself from bashing my face into the bathtub, I read it again. I couldn't let this one slide. I had to say  something .   In case you're too lazy [read: American] to read it for yourself, I'll sum it up - he's bitching about being a theme park employee and what assholes the patrons can be.    Ummm... what?! theme park guests are assholes?!... OH MY GOD!!   ...is anyone else  surprised ?   I didn't think so.   Theme parks are  specifically designed to attract assholes .   DUH!   Look at the rides! Look at the shitty food! Look at the commercials filled with assholes beckoning you to the gates of Whatever Bumblefuckery Paradise Park! Jesus.   My friends and I as kids went to the park for the near exclusive purpose of assholery. Buy a clue, friend. If you hate assholes, don't work a job where you are fucking  guanrateed  to meet them... unless you're a full-on masochist... in which case I'll hire you....   [fetish]   I digress... [surprise]   Let's see what brilliant observations the phoenix had to make here... [ his words in   red ]     Humanity comes to its worst when they enter a theme park.    Well there you go right there! He's hip to the jive! Let's see what else he has to say...    No matter who you think you are, 99% of the population is one of these when they go to a park:     an asshole   a complete moron   Umm... well yeah - you basically just said that. But thanks for the cool "team research" statistic. By the way, given your 99%, you've included vitually all theme park employees... just so you know, cowboy.   [thumbs up]    moving on...    Manners: Food Consumption      huh? - ok... we'll give this a chance...            Ok folks, we’re not fucking kidding, you are complete slobs. Every theme park I’ve ever been to the guests (a.k.a. all of you) are complete fucking slobs.     Exactly where does the surprise come in? You take several thousand Americans, jam them into an entertainment complex, provide them with thousands of pounds of junk food and disposible plates and cutlery... and you expect them to be neat and tidy?   [pointing and laughing]      If this were Canada, you might have a point, bucko. But it's not, lil' guy. It's America. See? [pointing around] ah-MAAARE-reh-cah.   Very good!   oh and beside all that...    That's what YOU  bitches  are hired for ... to clean up after our lazy asses. Quit your bitchin' - We're keeping you employeed.      Manners: Smoking      There's no way this can be good...           Let me preface this with this comment. I have nothing personal against smokers. If you want to kill yourselves, be my guest.     Thank you I'm glad we have your permission - and on behalf of all smokers, we'll continue to let you stuff yourself full of all kinds of American bullshit food that, believe it or not, will kill you  faster  than our smoking will kill us. More cheesey butterbacon anyone? :)      Let's let him finish...         However, I do not appreciate waiting in a line while your jerkass lights up and infects the rest of the line with your death. Show some respect to your fellow man, and don’t light up in line. You’ll get someone talking to you real soon with the power to throw you out of the park if you do light up.     Fair enough. Though we aren't infecting you with anything. Sure it's annoying and it smells but it won't kill you. And, by the way, aboslutly no one is afraid of theme park employees no matter how much "power" you have. It's a theme park. Your threats are made of cotton candy and children's laughter. And why are you waiting in a line in the first place? You fuckin' work there, champ!        The asphalt is not an ashtray folks. Stop tossing your cigarette butts all over the place. There’s easily a trash can every 30 feet or so. Use them… or pay the price.      The asphalt IS the ashtray. Period. That's why it's covered in cigarettes.&nbsp;Oh... and we've already paid the 60 million samolians or whatever it is to get into your goddamn special funfuckery farm. Back off. You want us to use ashtrays? Well we want  you  to hire friendly, minimally intelilgent, responsible staff. Let's see if either wish comes true.   The rest of this half-baked nonsense rant goes on to address such firery topics as "The Dress Code" and running on the blacktop [oh sweet fucking Jesus no!] and something about sodomy.    What's my point?   Glad you asked.    Nobody gives a shit.    [Full-on balls out laughing]   No one cares.  You work at a goddamn amusement park . What did you expect? I mean, c'mon - Strippers don't complain about getting oggled and occasionally felt up. You have nothing to bitch about - you're in a job that guarantees that you'll run across all the assholes of the world from rich fellas to ditch dwellers. Suck it up, chuckles. You're working at one of the happiest places on Earth - be happy.   (and you're twice the schmuck if you just made a mental note to remind me that the "Happiest place on Earth" title belongs to Dishney and not Six Fags)   You're in customer service no matter how you want to look at it. Which means, of course, that  every one of these idiot patrons is your 'daddy' . That's right. Smile and get me a soda, bitch. You're there to make them happy. Learn to deal or quit and get another job. The folk who visit your park will never change.   It's really that simple.

         Hello everyone out there in Beer N Porn land!    It has been a while since either I or my esteemed colleagues have posted anything, and there have been a few things on my mind as of late.    So strap yourselves in and get ready for another “kick your ass” roller coaster ride!             …                     Speaking of which…             The topic I choose to speak to the masses about today goes to two sad facets of humanity:    Stupidity & Manners.    And I am going to use a theme park as a reference here, because it is most certainly a nexus of moronic behavior.             Ok, let’s start right off the bat.    Humanity comes to its worst when they enter a theme park.    No matter who you think you are, 99% of the population is  one of these when they go to a park:        an asshole      a complete moron        I don’t know what it is about this location that causes the brain drain that occurs.    Let’s take a look at it from a few angles.                      Manners: Food Consumption              Ok folks, we’re not fucking kidding, you are complete slobs.    Every theme park I’ve ever been to the guests (a.k.a. all of you) are complete fucking slobs. Now I know that you are tired from walking around the park all day, and of course, the rides (another story altogether which I am getting to) completely took the wind out of you, so I understand how hard it is for all of you to lift a tray with about 1 lb of trash on it and simply put it in a trash can.    ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS!?    Good Christ!    And it doesn’t end there, my dimwitted park goers, no!    If you happen to buy a soda or something at a stand, once it’s finished do you just carry it until you find the nearest trashcan, which most good parks put one ever 30 or so feet?    NO! Of course not, you throw it on the ground, and make the whole place look like a shit hole.     Smokers, you get a whole section devoted to you, but just let me say that the ground is not an ashtray; throw your cigarette butts away.    All in all folks, I hate to break it to you, but when you go to a theme park, you are disgusting.              Manners:    Smoking              Let me preface this with this comment.    I have nothing personal against smokers.    If you want to kill yourselves, be my guest.             However, I do not appreciate waiting in a line while your jerkass lights up and infects the rest of the line with your death.    Show some respect to your fellow man, and don’t light up in line.    You’ll get someone talking to you real soon with the power to throw you out of the park if you do light up.             The asphalt is not an ashtray folks.    Stop tossing your cigarette butts all over the place.    There’s easily a trash can every 30 feet or so.    Use them… or pay the price.                Manners: Rules of the Park              This one is pretty basic.    What I am referring to here is adhering to the general rules of the park.    Now this part is going to be manners specific, and there’s only one thing I can think of when I think of this:    The dress code.    Who would have thought, that a PRIVATE company where it is a FAMILY environment (as most/all theme parks are) would have a dress code?    Wow.    That’s new, isn’t it?              …Right?             C’mon people, this one’s really fucking basic.    Don’t go to a theme park and be shocked when one of the workers asks you to put your shirt on,    no one wants to see a pimply, fat old man walking through the park with his shirt off, manboobs swaying for all to see.    On the reverse, ladies, don’t be surprised if you go to a water park and you are told that your thong is inappropriate for the environment.    While it may be aesthetically pleasing (and sadly most of these women who do wear thongs have no business wearing such) it is not conducive to a family environment.                 Guys, you know the ones I’m talking about, the ones who think a theme park is a place to show off their muscles, get a grip, put your fucking shirt on.    Also, if you go to a theme park specifically to meet a partner… I fear for reality as we know it.    Also, please try to leave your “Fuck the [insert dominating figure (the man, the system, etc) here]" shirt at home.    If you want to wear shitty/sluttish clothing, that’s what high school/college is for. Simple enough, follow the fucking dress code, it’s there for a reason.              Stupidity: Rules of the Park              Ok, more stupidity!    Why are you running on asphalt and get offended when someone asks you to walk?    Would you like to trip over a crack in the ground and bust your stupid ass on the ground, crying like a girl with a skinned knee? No and neither does anyone else.    Stop running.             Why are you walking around on hot blacktop without shoes?    Morons! Put your shoes on!             Have I driven this into you enough?      RULES ARE THERE FOR A DAMN GOOD REASON.    FOLLOW THEM OR DON’T BITCH WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU AS A RESULT OF YOUR STUPID ASS.                        Manners/Stupidity: Rider Responsibilities              Ok, if I tried to separate responsibilities into two topics, I’d have to kill myself out of frustration.             All right, so the reason you come to a park in the first place, the rides. Who the hell goes specifically for anything else other than the rides? I digress.             All right, let’s talk about you.    No, not you.    YOU…    You who develops an invincibility complex upon entering a park.    You who will argue with someone who is obviously trained on these rides and looking out for your own safety when they tell you that you cannot go on a ride.    You who would attempt to remove restraint devices while a ride is moving.    You who causes the rest of the guests in the park a lot of heartache when your dumbass does something stupid and causes a roller coaster to get stuck on the lift hill 180 feet above the earth.             Ok, that is enough setup.    The sheer stupidity and lack of manners on these rides boggles my mind.    It’s like they feel that they can do whatever they want and fuck the rules! Rules are made to be broken!    That’s the American way!    Wrong, dumbass.             Anyone ever been in this scenario, or seen this scenario?    The operator (the person who’s running the ride) tells you flat out at least 3 times that they are going to unlock your restraints and not to panic.    The restraints open, and all of a sudden the entire train of a roller coaster is stricken with panic with shouts of “Hey my restraint’s open!”    Actually, I shouldn’t give you enough credit by being able to string those words together. It is actually something more like this:             “Uh…. *Hand raised*”             “HEY YO MY LAPBAR’S UP!”             “AXCUSE ME! AXCUSE ME!” (No, I’m not lying; there is no “E” in these comments)             And then my personal favorite:    people running off the ride because their lap bars opened up when the operator SPECIFICALLY told you that they were going to be unlocked.             *Rage*             Ok, you people have got to get a fucking grip.     When someone tells you that the restraints are opening, FUCKING LISTEN TO THEM!    These people have a Public Address system for a reason, moron.    Let’s talk more about that PA system.    You know whenever someone is talking to me over a PA system I usually just continue doing what I do best: hold my junk and drooling on the ground.    Jesus Christ people, the 4 or 6 or however many people that are strapping you into the ride probably (read: definitely beyond a shadow of a doubt) know more about the ride and they way it is run than you do.    So if they ask you to do something:           It is not an attack on you or your personal intellect.    That’s my job.       Do what they tell you to do.                   Ok, round 2, you ignorant ignoramuses.    Let me put it to you this way: Every ride I have ever been on in all the parks I have been to (and I have been to plenty) have signs all over the ride that state the rules and rider responsibilities of the ride.    (Gasp!    I have responsibilities on the ride!    Pshaw!)    Yes folks, sorry to break it to you, but there are rules you have to follow when you’re waiting to get on a ride, or riding on a ride.    Let’s use roller coasters, as they are the focus of most of my hatred for these morons.    (For whatever reason, roller coasters are the nexus point of people’s lack of manners and sheer stupidity)    Ok, when you’re waiting to get on the ride, take the time to actually read one of these signs, you’ll find them enlightening.    Every single one I have ever seen will tell you the following things:    How tall you have to be to get on the ride, that you need shirts, shorts, and shoes on the ride (some rides you will take your shoes off, but you still must show up wearing them, don’t argue with the attendants and operators about it, you need shoes in the park, you need to come to the ride with shoes.),    that no smoking is allowed in the line, that no loose articles are allowed on the ride, that line jumpers will the removed from the park, and that riders must be in good physical condition in order to ride (Which means don’t come to the ride drunk off your ass or in shitty physical shape.    These rides kick your ass.).    Now, why are you arguing with the attendants and operators when they are following the rules that are set not only by the park, but by the company that created said ride?    If they tell you that something is a loose article, don’t waste everyone else’s time by arguing that you’ve brought it on the ride before and that it should be just fine.    On that note, if you had bothered to READ THE FUCKING SIGN than you would have known to either put those articles in the loose article boxes or give them to a non rider.    Don’t argue with the attendants about the height, either. Don’t say you’re going to accept responsibility for your kid if anything happens.     The heights qualifiers are there for a reason, and I can’t believe that parents would put their children’s safety in danger by putting them on a ride they aren’t tall enough to go on.    Fucking tools.                     In the simplest language I can muster:             Act like adults.     Treat others the way you want to be treated.     Clean up after yourselves.     Follow the rules.     Don’t be stupid.                     Till I bless the world again with my life giving presence…     ~ The   Phoenix

      Hello, everyone out there in Beer N Porn land!  It has been.... yeah a long time.  I haven't posted since my spewage that was the New Year's Edition.  Ok, do lots of things have happened between then, and I won't bore you with a run down now.  Maybe later.  Maybe...   Ok.  So here's my return to the universe of BnP.   WARNING!!!!!   I wrote this in March.  That's right, March.  But I read it again, still figured it was good, so I'm putting it out for your torment.  More up-to-date schtick will be coming soon! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Title: Surprise! College isn't what you think it is!   Ok, so I’m here sitting in my OPIM (Operational Information Management) course typing this.  That’s right, I said I’m in class.  For the previous 45 minutes I’ve been surfing the web, going to Yahoo to play the Crossword, talking to people online with AIM, and I have to wonder why in fact I am here.  And I don’t mean in this classroom on a chilly yet sunny day in Storrs.  I mean why the hell am I in college if academics are not doing it for me.  I’ve been here at the Good ‘Ol U of C for 4 years…  That’s a long time.  I have taken classes that are to “expand” my mind and the way I think.  That’s a bunch of bullshit.  I can barely remember what I learned last semester let alone what I learned my freshman year.  So why go to college?  What’s the point?  People are the reason.  Case in point: I am a shy guy. (Anyone who sends me a message about Super Mario Bros 2 is getting a sample of my new product, Shut the F up Soda.  … And I also just proved how much of a geek I am, whatever.) At least I was when I was 17 and new meat in the grinder that is UConn.  And now, 4 years later, I am still that shy guy. He’s hidden out there somewhere.  He comes out for parties and things like that.  I met 250 people on my first day of college.  250 people that I know who would otherwise be nonexistent to me and never would have had the chance to change my life forever.  I’m a band geek because of it, but wow, was it the gateway to forever change who I was.  I don’t care about classes, classes mean nothing.  It’s a bunch of buzz worded bullshit that’s crammed down your throat so when I go to get a job I can say, “Ooh, look at my shiny business degree!”  Fuck.  I hope I never get to be that much of an asshole that I sit back in a comfy chair and talk about buzzwords in the intricate dance that is a job interview.  Tango well enough, you get the job.  Miss a step and you die.  I can’t wait to be done with this farce.  Time to bounce, class is over and so must I be.  I’ll be back to finish this.  Ok, so now I’m at work.  Standing-by in case anything goes to hell on the job.  And I’m still in Storrs, and it’s Friday.  Where was I? So much as happened in 2 days.  Oh yeah, why college is necessary. People are the reason why one goes to college.  90% of the people I have known have been from college.  That’s a large ass percentage of my friends.  Now I love my high school friends with everything, so it’s not that the 10% of my friends who are from home are worth any less, the fact that one would consider worth in friendship is kind of odd in my own opinion.  My friends are the ones who have kept me going when I’m down, when I’m REALLY down, and are ones that share in my glowing accomplishments.  Ten years down the line I am not going to care what I learned in college, what I am going to care about are those people who helped to shape my life in the years that I was the most malleable.  Now, to play Devil’s Advocate, I am not saying that college is just a social zone where you are expected to learn nothing and just meet people.  If you wanted that, just go to a frat party, there will be tons of good people worth meeting there.  (Maybe sarcasm, perhaps not. I will be considered indifferent on this issue.  I don’t really think that frats and sororities are what cause people to act like jerks, bitches, or assholes.  People are the way they are.  It does however seem that traits are magnified sometimes when you join one of those organizations.  I speak from the inside looking out folks.)  Classes do serve a good purpose, to teach you HOW to learn, not what to learn.  I’m taking a course in Dante right now, and I wouldn’t have a damn clue where I would start with the reading of that thing, it’s complex shit. I’m glad I have a teacher that has somewhat of a clue how to steer my understanding of the piece.  Other classes I have taken, like my OPIM 204 class, is a complete waste of my time. It’s a classroom regurgiatation of what I have been learning on the job for the past 5 years.  In a year, I graduate from UConn.  What will I remember?  Will I remember that one course that changed my life? No.  Am I going to care about what I took my fifth semester? No. I can barely remember what I took my fifth semester now!  What I can and will remember is the people that helped change my life. I’m never going to forget the name of the person who got my into the UCMB; I’ll never forget who gave me entry into an organization that did in fact change who I was and magnified my good ideals; and I’m not going to forget that the road to my happiness was paved by going to the mailbox, and reading the letter that said: “You are hereby accepted to the University of Connecticut.”  It should have read: “You’re going to UConn. Be prepared to have your life changed in ways you never would have thought possible.  Imagine that your limits will be tested beyond your wildest imagination.  You are going to meet people in your first days that will still be with you, and will forever be with you through all the ups and downs.  You are going to join organizations.  You will drop out of organizations.  Your loyalties will be concreted. You are going to decide here what you want to do with your life. You are going to try. You are going to fail. You are going to try again.  You will eventually succeed.  You are going to leave this school by graduation or otherwise with a better idea of who you are.”  I have learned about myself.  I have faced my fears, tested my boundaries, and I will never look back.  Burning in flames to be reborn in light…  Peace.  ~ The Phoenix

      [5.24.04]  Alrighty. So today was mouse hunting day. I got up extra early and sat around twiddling my thumbs for about 2 hours -  urlLink Best Buy  didn't open until 10. Fine by me - I still needed directions. After keyboard commanding my way through  urlLink mapquest , I got directions and nearly flew out of my apartment at 9:30. The hope was that I'd get distracted enough on the way that I'd end up there at the exact moment they opened.  I tried to kept the directions straight in my head while dodging morning joggers, bleary-eyed students, early morning execs, and pet fanatics - all under a dripping, dingy, rat fur colored sky.  What a way to start my day.  Determined not to let it get me down, I sang a little as I trucked along. About 5 min after I had started my mouse quest, I just happened to look over to my right and what to my wondering eyes did appear?   urlLink Fenway   I stood transfixed for a few moments hardly aware that I was on the verge of mindlessly stumbling into traffic on account of edifice fetish.  Awesome...  [drool]  [Freud 1 - Dexter 0]  Composing myself and resuming my little song, I continued down the puddled-spotted sidewalk toward Best Buy. I ran across a  urlLink BK  and stopped in on principle. Thus far, BK had been good to me - I couldn't very well just walk by without a quick hello [read: dropping a deuce in their quasi-hygenic facilities]. Plus, my lil' tummy was gearing up to protest a fuel shortage soon. Perfect timing once again, BK. I nabbed a sandwich, skipped the deuce for the moment, and got back on track to Best Buy.  Thank God I'm a child of the 80's. My extensive Frogger experience helped me cross two busy streets of drivers who wanted nothing more than to turn me into black top carrion.   [ mad dash! ]  And there it was... Best Buy... ...  closed...   [crap!]  I sat outside of Best Buy on a concrete wall for 20 minutes while workers inside milled around. Thankfully I was not alone. An old west indian woman and a fella full of  urlLink lattes  were with me. Joy. The woman kept peering inside and gesturing at the employees. I think all she really wanted was a hug.   whatever.  Best Buy open and I strode in with purpose, baby. I found the mice, nearly decked a Best Buy rep. when the mouse on display [10 bucks] was out of stock, nabbed a 19.99'er and headed for the door.  Bastards.  So be it. I have my mouse.  [schweet]  Back down the soiled sidewalks, over the trecherous roads, quick stopping for some groceries, over a bridge, and a pack of smokes later, I was back in the apartment huffing and sweating fondling my newly acquired hardware.  Goodbye Keyboard Commando. Hello wicked slow porn surfing!  [note: notice my quick shift into  urlLink Bostonian ? I'm becoming one of them!]  I sat there for a good chunk of the rest of my day relishing the mouse-tasticness of it all.  Then boredom struck.  Hard.  Thankfully a call came in summoning me to Forest Hills. Braving the sketchy late night train crowd [ including a woman who proceeded to demand quarters from EVERYONE waiting for the outbound train - her mom aparently had colon cancer (insert sympathy here) ] I hopped the T over to Sean's place. A jam session, tomato sandwich, and concert planning session later, it was time for some Eastern Meditation Madness and then, thankfully, some uncomfortable sleep.  I was already missing my mouse.

      [originally post on 5.24.04 @  urlLink BnP ]  Alrighty.  Sunday has come and gone. Let’s recap.  I finished off “The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon”. Not King’s best but certainly a winner. Picked up Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and started digesting that parchment truffle. Wandered around Boston for about 4 hours with a friend (Colin – yes he is… no we didn’t – shame on you) who showed me a great many of Boston’s offerings. After scarfing more BK, I headed back to the apt and tried in vain to porn surf without a mouse. I’m telling you now it’s damn near impossible… damn near…  [ahem]  After that little adventure, Sean stopped over and we played and sang on my roof for a while. You know, the little things ear making this whole move worth while – singing at the top of my lungs on a foreign roof veiled in cigarette smoke, warm tar underfoot with unlearned strangers undoubtedly mumbling anonymous critiques, laughing at the sky for no damn reason, daring the clouds to rain on that perfect setting… [sigh]  Magic.  We ambled in shaking with equal parts laughter and cold – Boston had been playing it cool all afternoon and it was time for yours truly to get indoors. Inside? We chatted for a while and then went mouse hunting. [note: I forgot my mouse and have been using nothing but keyboard commands] By then it as close to 9pm and, wouldn’t you know, there were no mice to be had.   An ATM beckoned nonetheless and Sean and I decided it would make a perfect studio. We made ourselves right at home amidst the eggshell flood lights and pea-green monitors. I got a very quick guitar lesson before the ATM room was filled with patrons who apparently didn’t agree with our studio idea. Undaunted and armed with Sean’s Ibanez, we made grand fools of ourselves traveling the streets of Boston improving blues [Anybody got Drawz fo’ Lease?] and generally jarring the drowsy public with Sean’s great guitar and my shameless singing. Somehow we made it across street and past several cock-eyed passersby and settled on my stoop. Chilled but triumphant, we climbed the stairs to my apartment babbling in the language of satisfied men.  Once inside, we chatted the night away – light fare really; God, the universe, and everything. Before too long, the digital clock bade Sean home and, after walking him down, I headed up to be alone in my palace.  It simply does not get better than this.

      [originally posted 5.23.04 @  urlLink BnP ]  So here I am in Boston’s Back Bay area just a stone’s throw away from the from the famed Jillian’s and a drunken quarter-mile stumble from Copley Square. Fenway is within shouting distance, The Boston Conservatory is literally across the street, and the Prudential Building vies for my attention amidst a sea of various apartment building and hostels outside my window.  Beantown, baby. F’ing fabulous.  I guess I should start from the beginning of all of this...  About a week ago I was working at my deluxe-all-time-sweet job at the XxtraMart when I get a phone call. “How’d you like to live in Boston for the summer and play with my band for free?”, came the phone on the other end. My best friend was ecstatic with the news and I stood there with the receiver to my ear bleating “yes” like a bored chick getting dry humped by some ne’er-do-well in the back seat of a beaten sedan at the drive in.  Money.  This is what I had been waiting for. An unbelievable opportunity had just fallen into my lap and I wasn’t about to turn it down. I hung up the phone after making him promise to fill me in on the details when I got back to my apartment and spent the rest of my shift with a $1,000,000 smile and an erection that only a well worn hooker could love. A week later, my crap backed into so many bags and/or flung carelessly into the trunk of my roommates car, I scurried up to Boston sporting the same unbelievable thumper.  I met my buddy outside of the New England Conservatory and we ferried him over to what was to be my apartment. After 30 min of one-way street denials, we finally pulled up to a modest five-story yellow painted brick building. We carried my crap up the 4 flights of stairs to the top floor, piled it onto the couch, and, after a few brief words and some gas money, my ride headed for the hills. Sean suggested I head over to his place to hang out and well by gosh golly gee I did. We hopped the T (train) and I spent the night playing guitar and generally catching up with Sean. Morning came and I rode the T back to my part of town so that I could get my things organized.  Things took a turn.  On the way to the T the night before, we took a roundabout route that led us to some quality dining at Burger King (sweet!). Needless to say, I couldn’t just retrace my steps from the night before. But so what! I confidently stepped off of the train saddled with my trombone and a newly acquired GUI-tar and started hoofing in the general direction of my apartment.  After about 10-15 min, I found the street I live on but, wouldn’t you know it, that fucker was long! I knew I was close to my apartment but I didn’t know whether it was to the left or to the right. Whatever. I was in a dandy mood and took my chances heading left. 6 blocks of unfamiliar territory changed my mind and, making a quick pivot, I headed in the opposite direction. That way lead to the same “I don’t know’s” and I found myself lost. What a fucking tourist. Luckily, I spied a pair of Boston’s finest, and, after some debate, shambled over to them burdened with the instruments.  And that’s when it happened.  “Hey guys, I’m lost”, is all I said. The response? “You lookin’ for the Boston Symphony?” said the lady cop... in Boston-ese. I was thrilled! My very first Boston accent! I stood there trying not to smile like a child-molester and hung on their every word. She and her likewise linguistically gifted chum pointed me in the right direction and finally, heaving and panting, I found my apartment.   Over the next few days, I was like a priest at an all-boys camp for the mute. I even got in touch with another friend of mine and had a couple beers in a sketchy ass Latino ghetto (in which I got lost).  Today? – I had French Toast and Meat (swear to god… that’s how it’s listed on the menu), finally got my computer up and running, finished a novel, smoked my weight in cigarettes, and rocked out hard on some guitar. I was in such a good mood, the gunshots in the alley outside my window hardly phased me!  I’m here for at least this summer but, hell, if things go well I wouldn’t be opposed to living in this town. So what if I have to spend part of my day dodging homeless panhandlers and partially-toothed Mexican psychopaths (true story). I’m in F’in’ Beantown, baby!

      There are a few things that I realize now that have been omitted from my previous posts – many of which have been highlighted by the questions you are all asking –namely my apartment.

How friggin’ sweet it that eh?   And my day, you ask? How was it? Well…  Today started off pretty slowly. I hung around the apartment in my underwear chatting with folk online and stuffing my face with beefaroni and cigarettes. Not exactly noteworthy experiences, I know. But I also had made plans to see Brother Blue. If you don’t know who he is, do a search on google and read all you can. The man is impressive.  Anyway, 6:45 comes along and, after a fairly boring day, I hopped the train to get to Harvard Square – Orange Line to Downtown Crossing… Downtown Crossing to Red Line… Red Line to Alewifes… Hop off Alewifes at Harvard. Easy, right? ‘Ceptin’ this ol’ fool rode the T to the end of the line and ended up 4 stops away from Harvard… oh and I didn’t have enough to get to Harvard let alone get back home.  Luckily I had my guitar.  Sitting down at a bustop, I broke out the axe and began to play. I had called Sean and he had pretty much told me “Get here! – Play for train fare. So I did… and didn’t get a dime. After a few phone disputes, I went over to the lady in the both at the turnstiles for the T and told her my story. Wrong stop… out of cash… what do I do? She let me back on the train for free.  Awesome.  Thank you “T Lady”.  Hoping back on the train and getting off at Harvard, I felt much safer. I was un-trapped and un-lost. I exited the station and ran smack dab into a small clan of misfits jamming out on the sidewalk – headed by Sean of course. We saddled up after a brief celebration and off we went…  …but to where?  In typical Sean fashion, he knew not where we were going… only that we had to get there. And, sure enough, after about 5 min, we were lost… again.  [crap!]  We spent most of Brother Blue’s performance traveling around Harvard Square trying to find our way. When we finally found Blue, it was all but over. We caught the last few minutes and I prepared to head home slightly unfulfilled. But all was not lost.  Blue noticed us [namely Sean… as they knew each other] and invited us back to his wife’s office to “jam out”. He talked about a million miles an hour shifting from one topic to another flawlessly. The man was inspiring.  After a brief improv session, we went to his office and watched the man do a 10 min improv version of King Lear. It was amazing.  Just… amazing.  The man is talented. We talked a fair amount with Blue and I have to say I dug the man. But time grew short and soon we were on our way. After a brief stop at a Pizzeria Uno’s [and some hijinx/storytelling there], we hopped the Night Owl and headed back to my apt to chat and otherwise instigate buffoonery.  Such was my day.  Slow? Sure, but Brother Blue made it all worth while. You really have to meet the man.   Tomorrow night, I head to the Cape. With any luck, I will have handed down the Turtles crown and will return for more madness. Until then, I bid you all a brief adieu.

      I should have let them exterminate.  Right before I left for the cape, a letter was slipped under my door informing me that my apartment was scheduled for “Free mandatory treatment - extermination in other words. Along with that, they requested that I move and clean and empty a bunch of this and thats to make their job easier.  F That.  I was Cape Cod bound. I didn’t have time for such triffles.  When I got back, I shopped. Oh, did I shop. What’s more, I’d found a Shaw’s Card in the apartment which meant EVEN MORE SAVING! HUZZAH! [tear] - I even got two huge bags of Lays... a splurgance you say? HA! Buy one get one FREE.  And then the rats came.  I left a half loaf of bread and chips [both sealed - how useless] on the couch. This morning when I got up to feast on my potato bounty, I noticed that there were new openings - several new openings.  The Rats ate my free chips.  DAMN THEM!  I have rats!  CRAP!  No more using the couch as a lazy man’s pantry.  Anyway, off to my second gig of the summer I went - this time with the Wooster Brass Band. 3 miles of terrible marching and mediocre music later, I was headed back to the city.  I had an amazing meal of lamb and rice at a Lebanese restaurant and then I headed back to my apartment laden with various whatnots for composing music on this damned iMac.  Quiet, Dobbs.  Back in my apartment I was immediatly hit with a beer jones and, remembering the brick oven joint (the name eludes me even now) I headed out once again despite my waning constitution.  I sat down armed with a Bradbury novel and ordered a Pabst... and then another... and then the bill came...  4 dollars.  Magnificant.  I’ll be back :)  Tommorow I have two more gigs in two more unknown cities for unknown masses celebtrating unknown soldiers and heroes. Joy. I may even get to play some snare.  Man am I ever beat...  ...ZZzz...

      So here I sit at 7:05 AM on a Sunday morning swadled in quilts and goose-flesh. I'm trying to get my head back on straight. I'm trying to figure out what the hell happened in the past few days...  Wednesday  I left for Cape Cod after a fairly uneventful day. The plan was that I take the train into Braintree [try saying that 3 times fast... (take the train into Braintree) it's not all that hard but it's got a catchy rhythm] and Sasquatch and Tom would pick me up on Union St. There was a Sox game (which we won) that night and traffic in the city would be hell. I contested that traffic on the T would be hell as well but, whatever, I knew where to go. I hopped on the Orange Line, hot-footed to the Red Line and sat down on a train with "Braintree" glowing on it's forehead.  [cue unplanned calamity]  While I was on the train, the switches that allow trains to move from one track to another malfunctioned. The train had to be temporarily shutdown... with ALL that friggin' Sox traffic.  wow...  MBTA's alternative was to put us all (that's right - ALL) on a few busses and ferry us over to Quincy Center/Braintree that way. We unloaded the T at Quincy [pronounced "Quinzy"] and piled onto the buses. We were clearly making the most of the space the busses afforded. I was stuck standing next to the driver and God help me if I wasn't using all of my strength not to let the throngs of people send me carrening over the danger-indicating "yellow line" and out the windshield.  What a rush.  We finally arrived in Braintree and I was set free from the masses. We had been let off at the bus terminal [and not the train terminal, of course]. My ride didn't know all of this and so it was still up to me to find Union Street. Not a problem. I found a sign with an arrow pointing to Union Street after a brief jaunt/looksee and headed down the road toward what I thought would be the otherside of the station - "Where the exit for the trains must be", I thought.  The Dentist’s office made a fool out of me.  That's about how far I got before I started thinking that if I went a little farther, I may never find my way back. Winded but undaunted, I headed back from whence I came. Lo and behold! My ride came growling up the road to meet me.   Rapture.  We were at the Cape in 45 min.   Wednesday @ midnight - Turtles  I can't/won't say much about turtles. I will say that I had ten (10) candidates who were stuck on economics (L8). Very shortly after we began, the scene went foul. Everyone was puking - everyone had their own personal garbage bag that they were faithfully filling with vomit (some went through more than one bag). It smelled worse than a burning leper colony. And the game hadn't been going on for more than and hour. It was a nightmare.  Such is Turtles I guess [shrug].  I was honestly more interested in handing down the Turtles Master title than I was in finishing the game. Austin (Master hopeful) was in a bad way that night and putting him through would not do. So be it. The game ended with 7 out of 10 victorious. I don't rememeber where I finally ended up sleeping.   Thursday - Cape day 2  I awoke and was immediatly aware of a motherbitch hangover. One of the youngins recognized my condition and handed me a bottle of J.W. Red. It did the trick. Bless you, Tom. I learned that shotgunning beer and stumbling about makes the day go by much faster. Fortunatly no one was hurt and, in fact, I got some tasty cake out of the deal. To be honest, though, I could only tell you that it may have been chocolate. I can't confirm that.  I decided that I didn't want to leave as Turtle Master and took Austin away.  We came back.  There's a new Turtle Master. Awesome.  Later that night I was punched in the face. Which was fine because previous to this, the offender had shieled my naked body from crowds of beweildered co-eds as I crossed the hostile territory toward ice and more confusion. Hand to God. Thanks Phil and Tom.  I still am not entirely sure why I was naked.  Apparently I joined a fraternity.  I wasn't even supposed to be there that night.  Sasquatch had arranged a ride so that I could stay an extra night and then proceeded to leave with all my crap in his car.  I haven't shaved in about a week now.  I collapsed in a heap on someone's couchbed mumbling to myself and apparently drooling. I woke up hurting and was brought home in the relative comfort of Austin's car. I hopped the train back home and gladly climbed the 5 flights of stairs to my apt.  I'm gonna have an incredible ass come the end of this summer.  I wasn’t at my apartment long. All roads eventually lead to Forest Hills and, you guessed it, an hour later I was on the T to Sean’s place. I had almost forgotten that I had a gig early the next morning.  Meet the newest member of The Boston City Band.  ...oh and the Worchester [pronounced Wuh-stuh] Brass Band.  Who would have thought that I could get so much done in a day.  I met up with my fellow bandmates in a small Christian town outside of Boston. After a short parade (and a rather terrifying Orwellian Speech at the town square) we headed over to the American Legion for some free grub.  Money.  Then it was back to Boston and Star Market [read: Shaw’s].  I have food - thank God.  The rest of the day wasn't too exciting. Sean lent me his iMac for the summer seeing as how my computers (that’s right - plural) have given out on me.  [cue Dobber chanting "One of us! One of us!"]  I found out that there’s a sweet little mama of a brick oven pizza place not 100 yards from my stoop... and they have Guinness AND PBR on tap.  Nice.  I climbed the stairs for what must have been the 5th time that day and eventually collapsed into a semi-naked heap on my little twin bed.  So I guess I do have a fair idea of what went down the last few days.   In a few hours, I go to march in some other small Christ-driven town. Right now, though, I’m gonna have a smoke, a shower, and, God willing,  a breakfast sandwich from BK.  BK - oh how I love thee.

      Parades - 2... in a row... my poor body...  I’ll start from the beginning...   I got up this morning in a flash - jumping out of bed, mind you. I was convinced that my mom was trying to reach me. Odd dream? - Maybe. Anywho after a terrible shower, I collected my things and headed over to the pick-up point for the Boston City Band. We piled into the car and headed over to Harvard Square for our first parade.  We rocked. Rather we sounded fair. And the parade was decent. Mile or two. And we actually got a smoke break believe it or not.  The parade route crossed a major road and, from time to time, it was shut down to let parts of the parade pass. How awesome is that? While we wrere waiting for it to open, the band chilledout on the sidewalk and I sparked a mean ol’ cancermancer and enjoyed the cool shade of a Maple.  This parade was much easier than the previous day’s parade and it was over quickly. Thank God. Off to the next concert we went.    The second parade [in Medford] was a little longer but so be it. It was cash in my pocket and, to be honest, that’s why I was there. We lined up, stepped off, and so began a painful sound excursion over the longest 2+ miles of my life.  Yet al was not lost. the Shriners were there and were right in front of us on Honda motorcycles. One of them had a sidecar. They did all kinds of maneuvers and such - it was great.  God I love Shriners.  The parade ended without much of a fuss. There wasn’t even a reviewing stand. So be it - I got paid. Huzzah. We headed back to the car with our pockets stuffed with checks and started undressed and packing away our instruments. And then I heard the words...  Free Food...  followed quickly by...   FREE BEER...  What?  That’s right! Free food AND free beer for all parade participants and the American Legion. How sweet is that, eh? We hustled over and immediatly began stuffing our faces with homemade goodies and downing cold beer.  We consumed quickly in comfortable silence.  After a min the silence was broken and, loosened by beer, chatting ensued.  And then the afternoon got even better...  The Boston Crusaders came to play.  Jesus loves me - this I know...   They rocked out a personal show for the participants and, before it was all over, we had to take off. Our bodies demanded sleep.  Heading back to the city, we unloaded at the pick-up point and I left the rest of teh gang sipping expressos as I headed back to my apt. Sean showed up about an hour later.   Big Surprise :)  We headed out chatting about life, reason, perception... elementary crap. Soon we found ourselves at Woody’s (THE brick-oven pizza place mentioned in previous posts) and our conversation continued over pabst, Guinness, and snackery.   The time came for planning the upcoming concert this weekend and we drifted not too unwillingly back to the Apt.  It’s now 12:07 - I’m beat to hell but man am I ever satisfied. Today went well. I mean, how do you top free beer? I submit that you cannot!  Sleep beckons, kids, and I’ll soon give in to the temptress. I hope my CT friends are having as good a summer as I am.

      Da Bands   So far, I’ve been doing a lot of takl about the bands that I play with but, as usual, I’ve sorta quickstepped over the details. Enough of you are already confused. This should help...   Da Bands   The Boston City Band  Let’s see... how do I describe this one? Wel... it IS it’s own band but, the members play in a number of bands. When hired, one does not know which band one will be playing with or who will be in said band. Basically there are a core of people Russ [the head guy] draws from. Out of this group, he forms anywhere from 2 to 7 bands. Then he hires a number of people to balance out the bands and, that accomplished, we are set loose on the parade.  Technically, I play with about 7 marching bands; The Boston City Band, The Worchester Brass Band, The Boston Windjammers... I think you get the point. So be it. Keeps me fed.   Frankpipe  Frankpipe is the reason that I’m here... more or less. It a band comprised of guitar, bass, drums, an ever-changing horn section, and a wacky frontman vocalist. the music is inspired by the bizarre and unusual as well as traditional whatnots. I think it’s safe to say that the music is unlike anything most people have heard. It’s Weird Al meets Mr. Bungle meets, Bobby McFerrin meets Rush meets Jimi Hendrix meets Tower of Power meets Wesley Willis.You have to hear it to understand what I’m getting at. Even then, I’m not sure if that’d help much.  In this band, I play the role of trombonist, composer, and whatever else I can lend my talents to. I’ll keep you all posted on gig dates. I think you’ll like our sound.  That about does it for the bands. When I’m not scuttling from one gig to another, I’musually sitting here chatting with you all, eating, or [lately] sitting at the bar at Woody’s drinkin’ my Pabst and reading. Don’t be surprised if you can’t reach me by phone. Just email me [DexterAML@yahoo.com] or IM me at GuinnessAML.   Now about my day...   I spent the first part of it sitting around in my boxers and T-shirt eating Swiss Cake Rolls [a childhood favorite] and chatting up folk online. Again, nothing too exciting or worth going into great detail over. And again, tonight I had made plans to see Brother Blue.  Around 1:15 I headed out to meet Colin for lunch in harvard Sqaure. I managed to stay unlost and had a mediorcre reuben at the Greehouse Cafe [or something like that]. We walked and talked through Harvard Yard [translation: Hahvahd Yahd] and, dropping him off at the Peabody Museum, I hopped the T bck to my place.  Sean showed up a bit later and I passed out while he did whatnots on the computer. When I got up an hour later, it was time to go and hang with Blue but I was anything but in the mood. I hung back at the apt while he went to experience Blue.   10 min after he left, Pabst beckoned and I found myself at Woddy’s belly up to the bar nose-deep in a Bradbury novel. [Sigh]. The Pabst flowed, the pages turned, and and hour later I was back here at the apt.  And then I noticed the phone.  Sean had left his cell behind. Awesome! - It was past nine and calls were free. I could finally call and talk with people.  Ha.  I talked with Don Mom a while [awesome] and with Don [likewise]. The others were busied with anything up to and including video games. So be it. I had “work” to do anyway. My next move was to get in touch with my radio promotions contact [neil, you great big wonderful man you] so’s the show could get some radio advertisements. Money! - he helped us score ads on 6 radio stations.  I’ll talk more about the show in tommorow’s post.  After that, Sean showed and we talked late into the night. I am, once again, beat and strangely satisfied.  Another day’s journey is complete...

      Ok ok  - so what happened today? - I’m so friggin’ tired but I can’t let my body rest just yet...  Got out of bed and damn near immediatlly got back into planning the concert. [Saturday night at 7:30 if you all are interested - details are at the bottom left of the website - Click on the link with Sean Frenette]. That went on for several frustrating hours broken only by the occasional brief roof-top jam/planning session and chess with Ed.  After that, I took a well deserved nap and woke to Sean taking off. 6 hours of planning has a way of draining a man. I needed liquid refreshment.  Off to Woody’s.  I was greeted by PBR [draft, baby] and plowed through the rest of the Bradbury novel [The Martian Chronicles]. i was almost sad when it was done. The man writes like I dream. Incredible.  After that, it was back to the apartment [up the stairs - I can almost feel my ass getting sexier - and back to my only CT link... the iMac. I chatted up some folk and surfed here and there but remained unsatisfied. I noticed that Colin, my Boston native chum, was online and working late. Turns out he worked about 10 min from my apt.  Adventure time.  I ef the apt at 10pm braving the weirdo crowds. What did I see? A dude feeling up his girlfriend’s ass, two dudes feeling each other up in front of Dick’s Last Resort [hand to god] a panhandler actually WORKING for handouts... well.. at least this one was singing, and not ONE but TWO stretch H2’s... that’s right. 2.  Anyway I found Colin, got a tour of the masion that he works in [no really - it’s a full-on 1908 masion] and we headed out to check out the manwhores, trannywhores, bums, skanks, fratboys, and other assorted folk that littered the sidewalks and cafes.  We stopped at a Pizzaria Uno’s and paid WAY too much for Newcastle [11.50 for two beers] and, after some great convo, it was back to dodging street trash. I walked him over the T and headed back to my apt.  What was so great about today? Is it because I’m getting used to the city? Maybe ‘cause I had more beer than usual? Or Bradbury? I always feel better after finishing a book.  You know... I don’t really care. Today was a good day and that is that.  Had I more energy, I’d post more. Believe it or not, I’m still worn out from the parades on Memorial Day.  With that, I’m heading to bed... by which I mean hanging out online until my body demands rest.  Until tommorow, young ones.

       Firstly, my apologies to those of you who were jonesing for a post last night. I was was too beat  down tired to deliver.     June 3, 2004   I woke up and decided today would be a good day to get the hell out of my apartment for a while - maybe a long long while... yeah. So I got dressed, grabbed Bradbury and headed out the door. I wandered like I’ve never wandered before - at least in this city. First stop was Copley Square where a classical duo of oboe and piano were setting up to play [nice]. Then it was down to the Boston Public Gardens - gaudy swan boats and all :). After that it was back up Boylston to Wendy’s... or BK. Unfortunately, for the first time ever, BK lost out [see previous posts. In my Boston, BK is king] to Wendy’s... because Wendy’s had a bathroom - whatever.  Filled and lightened, it was of to... somewhere. I basically went along until I found and interesting place - I checked it out and, if it had seats, I stayed a while and read.  After about 3 hours of this I ended up in the Fenway area [The Fens]. I saw a park bench in the shade and decided it would be a decent spot for Bradbury and I. I crossed a street thick with hectic traffic and had just sat down to read when...  Hey is that a sitar?  Hey... I know that kid - it’s what’s-his-name!... one of the kid’s from the NEC that I’d marched with... oh and Frankpipe’s bass player [Josh].  Good times - someone to talk to... and talk we did...  That is... until  she  came...   At first she was barely noticeable... just a small grumbling and mumbling behind us. That soon grew to loud talking and odd accusations to finally she was full on shouting at Josh and I - I caught this line clearly...    Crazy Woman:  “Indian Sitar Picnic of Whores!”   that’s right - We were an  indian sitar picnic of whores .  Fabulous.  She left about 5 min later pressumably going to spread her message of peace and love elsewhere.  Josh and I talked forever at the Fens and then to an Indian buffet and then next to the NEC dorms. Good times. And it should come as no surprise that Sean walked by. We hung out there - Sean, Josh, and I - for a bit until Sean [and a new newly arrived Sean] were going to practice a piece for the show. I followed like the bored puppy that I was.  After that madness, it was back to my apartment for some me time.  I hate dial-up.  I quickly got tired of frustrating myself [load, damn you, load!]...  ...stop laughing...  and I called Sean to see what the deal was. He was at josh’s - right around the block. Money.  After a quicky packy run, we wen’t up to Josh’s apartment and jammed out in Hindustani [sp.]for a few hours. The night was getting on and I walked Sean to the T.  I wandered.  A Friday’s caught my eye and I stopped in, ordered a Sam, got carded, and immediatly started flirting with the bartender for no reason.  She flirted back.  Fun.  We talked Tolland vs. Boston for a while and then, after she bought me a beer [wink!] it was time to head home.  I’m hoping tommorow turns out to be a little more interesting.  Pride Week June 4 - 13 :)  ...and I’m right in the middle of it all. What shall become of our young hero? Be sure to tune in next week!!  ... by which I mean tommorow...  lame... I know....

       Something isn't Kosher or Rant and Thou Shalt be Healed!   Ok. For the past week or so (maybe longer - who can tell in this, the land of the divine) there’s something that’s been nagging at my brain. Something is awry. Everyone seems to be fine but I can’t shake the feeling that something is.. I don’t know... off? I’m insane - this is true - but it’s lead to my calling home (twice) and, on several occasions, all but grilling friends about their emotional status.  Something is definitely not quite right.  Or maybe  wasn’t  quite right?  Maybe I  am  going insane. Maybe this is a prelude to a lightning spiral dive into paranoid delusional psychosis. Though it could be all that beefaroni that I’ve been pounding down. I can almost hear myself getting fatter.  [joy]  If I don’t nail this down soon, Prozak and or Wellbutrin may indeed be in my near future.  Or Hey! It could just be a form of separation anxiety. Right? I mean I am in a big ol’ scary city far far away from all that is familiar. It could be that. 99% of my friends are over in CT well outside of “hanging out” range. Plus I haven't seen my family in a little while. I mean that could be it. I don’t don’t too well away from my friends for extended periods of time. I’m no good on my own - just like the song says. I just need to make more friends here. That’s the ticket right there. Problem solved.  right - I’m kidding myself. Something is up.  heh  It could be “you-know-who”.   Every time he gets into some kinda trouble, my Spidey Sense starts to tingle. In fact it’s likely that he’s gotten into some kind of fix by now. I wouldn’t be surprised. The timing is just about right. I don’t think he got anyone pregnant though. I would have heard about that. He would have been on the phone 3 seconds after he found out about it, pitching the circumstances to me as if the world were ending. Though, amazingly, I’ve heard nothing from him since the Final Shouting Match (and my subsequent pussy boy apology... necessary? sure... but chaps my ass nonetheless) if you can believe that. Absolutely nothing. Some of us live our whole lives without news that good.  And the pissah? [see? every day more and more like "them"!]? I still miss the bastard. Figure that one out.  Years  of shrieking and death threats and near all out brawls and a broken guitar [grumble] and other assorted lameness later, I still miss the bastard. I mean sure, I don’t hate him... I just can’t deal with him. But he was a very good friend - my best friend for a while... and I didn’t even get the clean break that I wanted, dig? And the biggest fuck of it all? If he dropped the “act”, he’d be a sweet kid! ugh.   I actually almost wrote him an email...  ...and then I remembered why we aren’t talking and I returned to my senses. God help me if I ever return to that circus of confusion. Talking with that kid is as futile as trying to blow yourself. Never have I met anyone so convinced that they are on the brink of extinction... I mean  sure  of it. And I’d sit there on the phone trying to convince him of the obvious.  “You’re not a bad guy, you’re just an asshole because you believe that you’re a bad guy” , went the drone. And, believe it or not, this would start  fights , people. I'm shocked that it never came to blows.   wtf?  How did this even come up?  Mother of Pearl.  It’s gonna take one hell of a therapist to work that all out. In the meantime, Dr. Whiskey will advise me.  ...  man...  Could be that my sister is pregnant? I mean she’s a good gal but... I mean do you think she could have...  ???  God I don’t even want to think about it.  She’s not preggers. End of story.  Could be a tumor... [it’s not a tumor]  Could be a chemical imbalance [I hope it’s not a chemical imbalance]. Could be stress. Could be the waxing moon... [or is it waning?... could be that too]   Whatever.   For the life of me I can’t pin this thing down and, christ with crutches, it’s really starting to irk me something awful. I need a vacation... a vacation from my problems.  But I’m  FINE ... so why in God’s name am I so... paranoid?! is that even the right word?  I think so.  I know so.  I should start drinking more.  I need to get more sleep.  If any of you were looking for proof that I’m a full on demented paranoid delusional psychotic, you now have it.  Commit me.  ...  [end of line]

      So Pride Week kicked off today without much hurrah. i woke up to a gorgeous day (welcome after so much rain) and set out to find a place to do laundry. Funny thing about Boston - there’s really no Laundromat where one can do his/her own laundry. Oh sure there are Laundromats but you have to pay for THEM to do it for you... by the pound. .85 - .95 cents a pound seemed to be the standard rate. I was definitely not excited with the idea that some oddball would be fondling my unmentionables for the next three months. I decided to call Sean to see if I had missed something and I had - there are machine in the (ubdercreepy) basement of my building. Excellent. And I found that the machines are large enough (and my clothing stockpile small enough) that I can do all my laundry in one load.  That done, I tossed on a fresh shirt and headed out to find the opening ceremonies for Pride Week. There was supposed to be a flag raising at city hall around noon. I left at about 12:30 so I wasn’t expecting to see that - I only wanted to see the flag and get out of the apt to maybe meet a few folk. I ended up giving up after about 45 min. or so and, turning around near the Boston Public Gardens, I made my way up Newbury Street - sweet jesus... It’s like they WANT you to feel poor. What is Newbury Street, you ask?  [ahem]...  Newbury Street - an elongated shrine to the gods of self-service, affluence, and narcissism interrupted only by churches made mock ancient against a backdrop of concrete steel and neon blurred by clouds of dust and annihilation. The street is clogged with unbridled decadence; tapas spots, tea bars, italian suits w/matching brief cases, chittering midnight colored laptops, Silver BMW stallions, greased toupees, mannequins stowed posing in artifacts behind storefront glass, and all around the air is thick with the scent of business mingled with precious poisons - it issues out from under sidewalk cafe umbrellas and brass clad pub fronts.  It’s a Freudian garden of lust and sensual satisfaction - a wanton exhibition of fast talk and dirty cash - a grotesque transaction driven circus of elite members only juggernauts - a modern-day awareness optional bathhouse for capitalism's love slaves - a brothel for the outwardly polished yet inwardly crude. It is a den of well dressed thieves and manicured charlatans, and it is abundantly populated with easy prey.  I could hardly contain myself...  “Terror! Violence! Folly! Break down the lighted poles! Smash the tempered glass! Send the seasoned meats and pompous wines up in clouds of smoke and ash! Tear the drapes and rend the banners! Render them unfettered! Leave them to relish the consequences of their ill gotten nobility whilst they beat their brows sore in the wake of equity’s revolution. Set their hands to clay and wood. Acquaint them with sweat and ache! Renew their palms with calluses and blisters! Release them from their illusions! Bid them feast at the table of righteous humility! For it is good that they should suffer... and likewise we also with them. And having blessed them thusly, we may rest our vengeance so, gathered together, we may restore them to the bonds of fellowship from whence our strength and dignity flows”  This place was trendy/upscale city. I’ve honestly never seen anything like it. I almost felt bad walking on the sidewalk with old sneakers. Add to that the aforementioned thoughts and you have a fella bursting at the seams with rebellion. I was, in fact, just about the kick off the revolution when I heard...  “MEEEEEEEEP! ... ... ... MEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!”  [wtf?]  and again... closer...   “MEEEEEEEEP! ... ... ... MEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!”  And then I saw him...  An old man peddling a tricycle cart with a Red Sox banner streaming off of the back. His “meep meeping” was his only horn. And on the back of this wundercart? Four stickers that read “Kryptonite” and one, the coup de gras that read “I [heart] Dick”.   Swear to God... I [Heart] Dick.  I pray he’s not family.  I kept on past a rare jazz quartet of 2 guitars, a bass, and a drummer. They were decent. I kept on. I noticed that every couple of blocks there were people offering massages complete with the chair and such... right on the sidewalk... and they were doing decent business. I kept on. Past THE Friday’s [see yesterday’s post], past a number of trinket shops, coffee houses, and trendy sidewalk eateries.   Finally, I was nearing the end of the yellow brick road. To my surprise, a man who, at first glance seemed interested only in making cat calls at young gals and handing out magazines, asked me for change.  I flat out lied.  It had been the second time that day.  Right then I decided to come up with a better way of turning down homeless folk. Something honest that’s just short of “no”... or just plain “no”. Lying is not gonna cut it.  That moral dilemma solved, I headed back to the apt for some email checking and online jabbering.  After a few hours, it was off to meet Sean at the New England Conservatory [NEC] and, from there, to his house to plan out this concert.  [concert info: http://www.38cameron.com/music/socialforum.htm]  After some unwinding, a bit of planning, a quest for chinese food, and the late night arrival of Dave [Trench Coat Dave] and Eric Rey [Conga Player Extrodinaire] it was time to catch the late bus back home for some late night reminiscing and some quality sleep.  ... for tommorow we rock the forum.

      Man oh man am I glad THAT’S over...  Thursday night’s post ended with    ...it was time to catch the late bus back home for some late night reminiscing and some quality sleep. Tommorow we rock the forum.    ...and I meant every word of it. I needed sleep so very badly. The show would take up all of Saturday and I had to be fresh.  It would not be so.  I ended up staying up later than I had planned [writing the damn post] and went to bed at around 4. Now that wouldn’t have been a problem normally - I didn’t have to be up until between 11 and Noon.  I hadn’t factored Sean and Dave (Ripley) into my sleep plans.  I get my first call at 5:40 AM. It’s a Dave/Sean Chorus - They’re chanting/speaking the message into the machine... they want me to wake up. Practical Joke... funny guys... I smile and turn over in my sleep.   I was wrong.  I kept getting phone calls until 7:25 in the morning - 7 calls in all - one phone call about every 20 min. Just enough to keep me awake. Marvelous. I finally get out of bed to answer the phone now that it had become clear that they wouldn’t stop calling until they’d reached me. I pick up the phone in the middle of what was to be their last message and, after he realizes he’s no longer on the machine but has reached me, this is what he says:    Drew, I knew you’re probably pissed at us but Dave and I have been up all night, we;ve hatched a crazy plan, and we desperatly need your help.    [Oh no]  Their plan?   The Boston "T" Party ...  We'd get ourselves onto a train [a "T"], and... well... party. Singing, dancing, playing instruments - oh and handing out all things "T"; Golf tees, t-shirts, tea, pictures of "Mr. T", etc. all while dressed like swashbuckling pirates. And they were pretty well set on it. I could see that I had two options. Join this caravan of [insert adjective here] and man the brakes or leave them to their own devices and be caught at the venue sans two performers (Sean, in particular, who's name is all over the event). Plus I wouldn't miss an event like that for the life of me. So I joined 'em.  With the concert being THAT NIGHT, we had to act fast. And, after about 30-40 min of planning [and discussing what we believed to be the legal hurdles] it became clear that this was a tremendous idea. It had just come at the wrong time. We abandoned the T Party and I, for better or worse, got back into bed feeling [insert adjective here].  I get up with JUST enough time to get dressed and book over to Cambridge. The venue was amazing... and a little smaller than I had expected. No matter. We walked around and got a feel for it -- checking out sound (live spots, dead spots) planning out the seating, etc. etc. My role had already morphed from performer to emcee the day before so I wasn't worried about warming up or doing a sound check. That position didn't last long either. I found myself cutting sound-checks short so that others could ge ta sound check, fielding phone calls for Sean, doing some last minute planning with Judy (one of the event coordinaters), clearning the stage, making a set list... thus I became the show manager. It happened naturally and, to e honest, as much as I wanted to perform, I wanted more to make sure that this thing went as smooth as possible.  It was awesome.  The performers were incredible - every one of them. The house was full, Brother Blue rocked the house with "The Butterfly Story" - a perfect evening.  ...I fell asleep in a chair somewhere in the venue while the last of the equippment was being packed away. My last thought was... "I hope someone wakes me up before to long. I have a gig in the morning..."  ZZZzzz...

       Hey Kids,  I’ve had little time to post in the past two days - my apologies. To make up for it, Im doublign up this post. That’s Right! - Two days for the price of one!  Enjoy  --D     6.6.2004  3.5 miles to Freedom, My very own Mr. Jingles,  and Lamentations of the Terminal Man   	“Tom,” said Douglas, “Just promise me one this, okay?” 	“It’s a promise. What?” 	“You may be my brother and I maybe hate you sometimes, but stick around, all right?” 	“You mean you’ll let me follow you and the older guys when you go on hikes?” 	“Well... sure... even that. What I mean is, don’t go away, huh? Don’t let any cars run over you or fall off a cliff.” 	“I should say not! Whatta you think I am, anyway?” 	“ ‘Cause if worst comes to worst , and both of is are real old -- say forty or forty-five some day -- we can own a gold mine out West and sit there smoking corn silk and growing beards.” 	“Growing beards! Boy!” 	“Like I say, you stick around and don’t let nothing happen.” 	“You can depend on me,” said Tom. 	“It’s not you I worry about,” said Douglas. “It’s the way God runs the world.” 	Tom thought about this for a moment.” 	“He’s alright, Doug,” said Tom. “He tries.”  -- Ray Bradbury   Dandelion Wine   Homesick.  Like a big bitch...  [grumble]  Even Boston can’t make me forget... I miss my CT pals.  And everything is going so  well ! Heh - it’ll pass. In the mean time, I’ll buck up and be strong. Write, you bastards.    DexterAML@yahoo.com    I have a little mouse friend - I first noticed him two days ago.   I was sitting here [typing a post actually] and out he jumped! It scared me at first - mostly because I assumed that I had been alone in the apartment this whole time. This new guest was, at this point, neither entirely welcome nor entirely unwelcome. I mean, hell, he could have been here first. That aside, I immediately made plans to dispose of the lil’ guy - The Grand Usurper. Cute or no, he had to go.  but I didn’t...  ...and I’m not entirely sure if I will. He only comes out at night, pretty much keeps to himself, and there’s really no food for him here. Odds are that he’ll go away on his own someday. If he doesn’t, that ok too. It’s nice to have some company every now and again - even if he doesn’t speak english.  He was here to greet me after I had returned from my nightmare on Sunday.  The night before (Saturday) I had gotten plenty of sleep but, waking up on Sunday morning around 9:00/10:00, I was still beat... and sore... and not at all in the mood for marching. We were supposed to meet up at the NEC around 10:45 so I had no time to lose. I showered, got dressed, packed up my whatnots, and headed out the door.  At the school, little to nothing went wrong. A kid didn’t show. Another kid was late. We couldn’t reach Tom [our “in” to the Boston City Band] and we didn’t know how to get where we were going. We knew it was in Dorchester though so we decided to chance finding it on our own and we took off.  Madness ensued.  Finding Tom, waiting for Tom, getting lost, getting unlost, finding parking, not finding the band, JoMo’s freakout [trumpet player], and... best of all...  The parade route was nearly 3.5 miles [3.2 to be exact]... and, five minutes after we started marching [in short sleeved shirts and black pants], it started raining. And kept raining. Hard.  My body, still protesting the previous day’s adventure,  was outraged. Muscles clenched, tendons tightened, bones stiffened... my skin took on a grayish hue and leathery leathery texture.  I was in marching band hell.  I kept chanting “$$$, $$$” to myself hoping that my body would hold out. And, thankfully it did. Barely. By the end up the parade, I couldn’t even open my hands or speak clearly. When I got my check, I couldn’t put it into my pocket, let alone take it from the director’s hand. My body was a disaster.  oh... and we still had to walk back.  That’s right - no transportation... we had to walk 3+ miles back to the start of the parade.  Joy.  Luckily there was a T station nearby. We hopped it and got within a mile or so of our destination and walked the rest of the way back under a drippy grey sky.   I was dead by the time I got home.  I collapsed in a wet pile of bones and skin on my bed and was asleep instantly.  Sean came by briefly after I had gotten some rest and, after a brief visit to his place, I went over to Woddy’s for Pabst and Bradbury. That’s when I read the passage at the beginning of this post. That’s when I realized how homesick I really was. That’s when I got up to leave so as not to make a broken weepy spectacle of myself.  I’m gonna be fine.  I’m gonna be ok.  Just a little temporary static.  ...  [insert hug here]    6.7.2004  Reflections on my first time    Ok. So today was my first show with Frankpipe [www.frankpipe.com - though not much is there as of yet - check back often]. All I can say is wow... just... wow...  but I’m getting ahead of myself...  I spent most of the day practicing with Frankpipe, making plans for the show, and generally bugging out and having a good time with the band. We were slated to go on at 10 so, like good boys, we saddled up early and were at the venue around 9. Unfortunatly, we weren’t going on until damn near midnight.  Bummer.  So be it. We hung out, had a few beers, got some din-din, and enjoyed the other bands. They were damn good if I do say so myself. After the others went on, it was time to “light the pipe” so to speak. We hopped on stage and began to rock.  My GOD did I have fun.  It was a night of several firsts for me; my first show in Boston, my first time singing in a show, my first time beaking out of my shell and just out and out enjoying myself, my first time rocking out [hard] with Frankpipe. We left the crowd damn near speechless.  Think Zappa... now add acid...  ...lil’ more...  ...lil’ more...  ...ok a LOT more...  there you go... THAT’S Frankpipe.  It was a rocking good time and I sang/played my soul out. What an awesome night! After the show [and some random personal encores on the part of yours truly], we packed it up and headed home. We had all had a very long weekend and most of us had to be up at seven in the AM.  Thankfully, that didn’t include me.  Tonight, I plan on sleeping like I’ve never slept before. There won’t be much to talk about tomorow if all goes according to plan.  Meantime, fire off an email [dexteraml@yahoo.com] and say hullo- it’s damn lonely out here.  I’m off to dreamland.

       6.9.2004    “When you are away from a [place] it becomes a fantasy. Any town, New York, Chicago, with it’s people becomes improbable with distance. Just as I am improbable here, in  [Boston] ... All of us improbable to one another because we are not present to one another.”   -- Ray Bradbury   Dandelion Wine   It was HOT! My sweet jesus, it was HOT!... at least 1,000 degrees and more humid than a womb. I hope it stays this warm forever and ever until the end of time, Polar ice caps be damned. I woke up to ridiculous heat and I couldn’t have been happier.  I lie.  The night before, Sean had offered to give me his Alverez [electric guitar] out of the blue. That’s Sean. I didn’t really want to take it - I mean to be honest I was fine borrowing his guitar from time to time. But, knowing Sean, (and staring down the barrel of a free guitar), I accepted... but caveated, “I’m more than likely gonna sell it for an acoustic if you give it to me”. I like electric guitar fine but I’m really an acoustic man. And, should that electric guitar end up being mine, I was almost 100% sure that I was going to sell it/trade it for an acoustic.  I was worried that making this admission to Sean would change his mind but, it didn’t. In fact, he was all for it and suggested we go looking for guitars the next morning.  Wow.  The back plate had been taken of off the Alverez so it’d be a little while before it could be sold but that left no reason not to take a look around at a few stores to see what they had to offer.  I played a million guitars. There’s blood on the floor of every major guitar dealer in Boston thanks to me.   Bitchin’.  And then I saw her... A Blue Sunburst Ibanez... Abby. As soon as I started to play, I knew this was the one I wanted. I started silently counting the band gigs it would take until she would be mine.  Sean bought it on the spot. Just like that. And, just like that, I had a guitar. Goodbye, Alverez. Hello Abby.  Say hi to the nice people:  http://www.ibanez.com/guitars/guitar.asp?model=PF15MS  I was speechless for a long time.  This is the best gift ever.  I played until my body demanded I cease.  After that, I went to Woody’s with Bradbury for a tasty beverage [read: PBR].  ...  I’m not a fan of old movies. It’s not that I don’t like them, I just don’t watch them. Last night I saw “What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?”.   [I was in a ‘family’ bar at the time - it was apparently “movie night” - ‘nuff said]  Wow. Bette Davis scares me even more now... 'specially now that I know who she is.   I stayed for the whole thing.   I walked the 3-4 miles back to my apt instead of taking the T. Why? Exactly. I barely made it up the stairs [My legs and ass hate me... they hate me forever] and walked into the gloriously blazing oven that is my apartment. I baked. I suffered.  I slept soundly.

       6.10.2004   That morning, I was up at the ungodly hour of 5:47. I blame the media. They’re as good a scapegoat as anyone else. It was raining... again.... ugh. Bring back my stifling heat! I cued up Durufle’s Sanctus [Maurice Durufle: Requiem Op. 9 (1947) - Sanctus]. Just at the piece reached it’s climax, the sun broke through the clouds. You really have to hear the piece to appreciate what I’m talking about. It was epic.  After a day of rocking out/sitting on my ass/stuffing my face with pasta and assorted goodness, I headed over to see Sean at the NEC to get some guitar books. Of course something went wrong :)... and it’s about time!! I had locked myself out of the apartment.  [Blast!]  [Drat!]  ...and so I waited with Sean on the steps of my apartment... jamming intermittently, of course.   After a long while, we headed to Sean’s place.   That night, after some quasi-munchies, we headed over to the Hard Rock Cafe on Clarendon. Sometimes She Burns, Sean’s brother Kyle’s band, was competing in a battle of the bands competition.  They rocked.  Hard.  ...and lost.  Some rinky-dink band called “The Box” beat them out. In the end, though, I enjoyed the show tremendously. The band was amazing. The events manager at the Hard Rock gave them an invite to come back for a band showcase so all was not lost.  After the show, Kyle and I piled into his car with some band equippment and I, stinking drunk and deliriously hapy, crashed at Kyle’s place.  On to today...  6.11.2004   I got back to my apartment at around 11:30 and the superintendent let me in. Thank God. Sean and I talked a while about summer plans and other such things. After a bit, Sean took off to play in Harvard Square and I broke out the 4-track to start experimenting.  I’m planning on recording an album in the next year or so [stop laughing] tenatively titled “Little Green Life”. Figure that’ll keep me practicing... plus I can probably get Sean in on it - it’ll be fun. I have about 4 songs so far - only one of which is anywhere near finished. We’ll see. I’m working on a new song tenatively titled “Little Green Life (Are You Sleeping?)”. That along with “Long Day (Running Man)”, “Shine Down” and “Part of the Reason” will fill out the beginning of the supposed album. I’m busting my hump trying to improve my guitar playing so that the recordings will be bearable to listed to - let alone worthy of purchase. I’m trying to get away from imitating other artists but, at this stage in the game, I think it’s ok. I’m still learning and, soon enough, my own sound/style will emerge. It’s there but it’s still very reminicent of Dave and John Mayer... which I guess is an improvement on where I was about a month ago.  Tonight? - I’m heading to a birthday party for Ken - the drummer from the aforementioned band Sometimes She Burns. Should be fun. I’ve now decided to post when I can. It’ll still be once a day but some accounts may include the end of one day and the beginning of another. That’s more or less a function of the madness that my life has become.  Blessed sweet madness, I assure you.   Here’s to another day of getting things done.  Don’t wait up.

      I’m gonna make this short and sweet... well as short and sweet as I can. Not much happened and my ass is numb... Which is a lot less oxymoronic than that statement implies....  moving on...   Ken’s birthday party can be summed up as follows:  PBR + Drew = Chatty Kathy  ...oh my good good God. It was worse than normal. Probably worse than ever... I talked for hours and hours straight on... I only paused to get beer and go to the bathroom... oh and that 45 min span where I inhaled 61 burgers and 3 hot dogs... I was soooo hungry.... So that was Ken’s in a nutshell. Me - drinking - chatting (telling HORRIBLY personal life stories that no one wanted to hear at all [translation: tales of butt sex.... (shame)].  It was wonderfully grim. I knew only one person at that party.  I still don’t know if I was the one that moved the conversation into the “butt sex” realm. More than likely I was to blame.  Saturday morning comes and off we go to the Boston Pride Parade. It was not what I expected. Everyone pretty much had some combination of four things going on:  * Collecting donations for an agenda * passing out agenda related propaganda * Advertising random non gay specific goods and services on floats full of mega waif scantily clad dancing "bois" (and nothing but dancing boys) * Lube  That was all...  oh no wait... I lie.  There was an all gay Rugby Team.  ...  [ahem]  There was an all gay Rugby Team   After that, the rest of my day meant nothing. It was all about rugby.   Hours later at my apartment with pockets full of glow in the dark condoms, lube, propaganda, and lint, I found myself picking up my guitar again and, of course, rocking out.  Now THAT’s what I call Pride.  My day ended early which means, as I’m sure you regular readers know by now:  I march with the Boston City Band in the AM.   [Christing!]

       Ok ok... so I’m having a little trouble keeping up with my posts as of late. I get home and I’m beat. I’ll get my act together, I swear.  Midday posting - bad  Late night hijinks recounting - good   [noted]   Monday’s posts comes late tonight... keep your eyes peeled  So... how was Sunday...    6.13.04   I woke up with little time to spare and, after some online hellos and some quick personal hygiene, I sped off to the NEC. Today was to be yet another exciting day with the Boston City Band. Joy. I got there around 9:30 and we made off for Charlestown and Bunker Hill.  We arrived at 9:45-10 or so. This quaint lil’ NE town looked as if all of it’s residents had stayed up all night dusting this and polishing that. There was hardly so much as a gum wrapper to be seen. All the houses looked freshly painted. All the porches and lawns were swept and neatly trimmed. To be honest, it was a little creepy. It was almost  too  clean. Thank you, Stephen King, for fueling my suspicions. I got over it - we’d be marching soon and I’d be back in my filthy well worn neighborhood. Generally, we show up an hour before we actually have to march which mean the parade would kick off around 11 am.  The parade began at 1.  For two hours, we hung out under trees outside of a church. Then we were moved to a place by the water @ a military facility... then to another spot in the sun... then to yet another spot in the sun... were we broiled while we waited.  After we were nice and tired from being in the sun for so long, the parade finally began - 4 miles of uphill/downhill/uphill/downhill at a driving grandma’s pace with little to no shade at all. What fun! What glorious fun! To make matters worse, the townsfolk - now back from church and out of their fresh pressed Sunday’s best - were firing up grill after grill. Meat sizzled and charred. Vegetables roasted and streamed. They stuffed their faces as they watched the shambling rag-tag spectacle that was The Boston City Band. I nearly ate my own hand.  [Jesus take me now]  The parade ended just in time. It only took  two and one half HOURS  to march those 4 miles under a cruel christian sun. Going home, I was comforted by the sounds of  urlLink Mr. Bungle’s  After School Special.   sing along...   [My mom is better than]    [Your mom and your dad too]  [She knows nutrition well] [That's why I'm trim & lean]                       [Because she cooks] [She cleans]   [She lies...(she says)]                                   [I'm handsome]  ...moving right along  I haven’t added this: Three days ago I found out from the Super that the elevator is working. Not only that, it’s  always  worked. It was never broken.  Wow.  So, after the parade, I made use of this [creepy, oh god, I’m gonna die!] elevator. I escaped with my life and walked into my apartment. I felt like a half melted ice cream sundae. No matter. I was determined to [sleep] make something of the rest of my day. I got an IM from Tom [Boston Tom, not CT(naked)Tom]  inviting me to check out this chorus, Coro Allegro. It was only a few miles away and, after deciding against the block party, I went over to the church where they were rehearsing.  Madness ensued.  A drunken sunburned middle-aged bigot found the place before I did and, when I arrived, he was enlightening the group on the evils of homosexuality [read: yelling barely intelligible nonsense mingled with “fagots!” and other choice words]. Tom and a few others calmly escorted him out into the streets again and, after a series of kicks and shouts, he was gone.  The choir was awesome.  I know what you CDN folk are thinking and you’re right. Particularly since they were doing a piece in Latin. It wasn’t too hard sitting back and not commenting - in fact, it was rather nice. The director was damn good and, surprisingly, I learned some things while I was enjoying myself (he pointed out all the things I pointed out with you, CDN - maybe these are universal issues)... but I was fading fast. After a good rehearsal, Tom brought me home and, after a brief story time,  I charged up the stairs (not the elevator).  The story would have ended right here had I not thought of Woody’s.  I had to “stay regular”.  I went and got the beer that I had promised myself. It was glorious. Bradbury had tagged along or I would have gone home sooner. I got back to the apartment and crashed.  I don’t remember my head hitting the pillow...

      The day began with this plan:  A - Laundry B - Sam Adams Brewery Tour C - Harpoon Brewery Tour D - Hanging out with [Boston] Tom  Didn’t quite end up that way. The previous night, around about the same time that I was making those plans, I made lunch plans w/Colin. So, after laundry (which made my clothes smell kinda funny), I headed over to Harvard Square to eat a cheap yet satisfying lunch at a chinese place with Colin. Good times. We talked and laughed and such and, of course, he had to get back to work all too soon. After a brief goodbye, I headed over to a pay phone to call Sean. He and another band memebr were planning on playing somewhere in Havard Square. I called and asked where he was. “Turn around”, came the voice on the other end. I turned. He smiled. I had wasted 50 cents.  We eventually found Joe (trumpet, vocals) and set up near the Havard T exit and jammed a bit. Good times. Tom and I ate at Pizzaria Uno’s. I had the Peanut Butter cup thing. It was good.  Yay.  Then it was off to home.  My sweet Christ of life was it ever hot. I prayed for death. I got home just in time to get a laptop from Tom [Frankpipe Tom] and then it was off to meet Tom [Boston Tom] at the T.  [Too many Toms? Rock star says impossible.]  We hung out doing what it is that we do. My post tonight is brief because he is, in fact, still here and I want to get back to chatting/causing trouble.  I actually have company.  Good times.  Tom is my hero.  Meantime, I’m off to enjoy a night of unloneliness...  Tommorow is a new day.

      I slept. Oh how I slept. I was still very much worn out from yesterday’s concert and sleep seemed to be the only cure... and it worked! Around noon, after a long shower and a vigorous brushing of the teeth, I was refreshed... somewhat. Another nap finished the job and, soon after that, it was off the the Boston City Band (BCB) [Today it was actually the Worchester Brass Band (WBB)] gig in Dedham. We met at a 7-11 in Jamaica Plain and, while we were waiting, The Kryptonite Cart/I Heart Dick Cart guy returned [ urlLink see previous post ]. And he was “MEEEEP-ing”.  Wonderful.  In Dedham, a fight broke out.  We got to Dedham 45 min late and, after a brief frenzy, we found our fellow band mates and we geared up and headed off to start the parade. About 3/4 of the way through, we came across a vendor who was blocking half of the road. “We’ll just go around him”, I thought. Not so. One of the BCB veterans marching to my immediate right pushed the cart out of the way... with great force. The vendor, not pleased, retaliated and, predictably, a fight ensued. I was marching on completely unaware of what was happening behind me. When half of the band stopped playing, I chanced a glance behind me to see a number of band members confronting the vendor.  Magnificent.  It didn’t come to blows but the vendor did return to heckle us. I couldn’t help but think “Heckling is cool and it gets you kicked out of things - both of which are very tough”...   ...personal joke  Oh...  At the same time that this was all happening, a couple kids thought it would be a good idea to toss a stink bomb into the bell of the sousaphone player’s bell. They hit it dead on and the stank was great. The sousaphone player kept playing despite the horrible stench that he was now breathing in.  God Bless him.  The parade ended with no more fiascos.  I can’t say I wasn’t disappointed.  We dropped a couple guys off and then went to Anna’s, a mexican joint, where I was introduced to the Super Burrito - the largest and fastest prepared burrito I have ever had. less than a minute and bigger than a child’s arm. I devoured it in under 5 min. We gathered our ruined bodies up and went home.  Sean was knocking at the door before I had even had a chance to consider masturbating before a long night of sleep. We went off to Woody’s for a chat. Then it was off to the T with Sean and, after a bit of posting and late night chatting, it will soon be off to bed with me.  Tommorow is a new day.

      I'll get right to it.  Yesterday (Wednesday) I had plans (again) to go to the Harpoon Brewery. I was up early and ready to face the day and all that goodness when I got an IM from [Drummer] Tom. He offered me a ride home in a few hours for a few days of relaxation and whatnot before I fell deep into the bowels of Frankpipe fantastery the following week. I packed my crap immediatly and made off for home.  So... I'm home. Really. Just until Saturday night or so - I have a gig on Sunday. I'm at the old apartment if you want to reach me. The number is in my AIM profile.  That's about that. There probably will be no posts until I'm back in Boston so...  ..until Sunday, kids.   [CTing]

      Alrighty then...  CT was great - so were the majority of my friends. Essentially, it was a gigantic contact/hello/I miss you/goodbye festival.  [translation - drinking/hanging out/video gaming/drinking w/friends]  It was nice. Very good to see those guys. I was partly hoping to find a reason compelling enough to come back to CT once the summer was over. To be honest, as much as I miss those guys, there wasn't much of one. I can always visit from time to time. Not finding a reason to go back was good and bad - good because I think that Boston may be the place for me right now... bad because I kinda wanted to be pulled back to CT. I can't really explain that one... maybe I'm still somewhat homesick and still a little afraid of being out on my own in the concrete wilderness of Boston without many friends.  Thanks guys for going out of your way to come up and say hullo. I appreciate it.  [group hug]  I packed up and [warning - redundancy imminent] leaving was a little easier than I thought it would be. I came back with a heavier bag than I had left with - Febreeze, NEW socks [thanks squatch], a capo [again... thanks =)] and an updated laptop (thank God), my guitar picks, my head phones, shaving cream, MY MOUSE [a bit late for that] and, believe it or not, MY BEARD TRIMMER [Ultra-mega happy dance]...   I left my old apartment at 8-something without much ceremony - everyone was alseep or gone. I hopped into Tom's car [simultaneously accpting death - as is standard when riding in a car with Tom] and off we went. Driving back, Tom finagled me a gig for that morning - sweet - and I went home, dropped off all my crap, changed in 8 min, and trucked over to Brookline for the Fabulous Flag Day parade.  Total Marching Time - 45 min, kids  Awesome.  We swung by  urlLink Anna's  and, again, I breathed in a massive steak burrito.  Money.  I went home and showed Tom the work I had done building  urlLink Frankpipe's website . I got a fair amount of work done on it today as well. I only got so far as uploading the  urlLink splash page  as far as actual updates went but the website is very close to done. It's just gonna take some time to process my work and upload it all to the web. Look for it in the next week or so. Hell, I'll probably post a million links to it here the day I upload it so... keep an eye out.  After Tom took off, I kinda hung out here working on the website. Sean stopped by and [gasp!] brought over an amp. Now I can rock out at 10 times the volume.   [cocytus**: *rockstar stance* - Guinness AML: *windmill*]  We wandered around a bit, I cashed my check [pronounced CHIZ-ek] and, after chatting with a random German late night stroller, we headed back to my apartment and Sean evaporated in the general direction of [Jamaica Plain] JP.  And, now, here I sit. Tired, content, posting, and still putting off unpacking...  [smile]  Something about that is just encouraging.   Sleep comes and I'm armed only with OJ, Swiss Cake Rolls, and the Internet.    Who will emerge victorious?

      Today was the day - the band was meeting at a bandmate's house for a retreat. Planning, rehearsal, and general fellowship was to be had. Good times.  It went well - I mean honestly there isn't much to say on the matter. We rocked out, got in some new music, clarified our plans for the summer somewhat, and generally had a good time. Tommorow we rock out in Harvard Square (8pm).  I don't have much else to say - tommorow I'll be gone again for the most part. I'll add some details about what happened today sometime tommorow evening.  In the meantime, I'm off to bed.  Oh so tired and oh so satisfied...   Drew

      I'm smoking too much.  And man am I feeling it.  In CT, I didn't smoke this often. I'd blame it all on stress if I knew what was stressing me out or, more specifically, if I were more in touch with whether or not I was stressed out or not. I smoked almost a pack today.  Jesus.  For the most part, today was good. I was charged with all kinds of creative energy and tackled a number of  urlLink Frankpipe website  tasks. So far, the only thing that's up is the splash page and  urlLink this  lil' thing. The rest is still tragic. No worries. The updates will come soon. I broke myself and bought a book on Flash MX. It doesn't have much to say but I figure I can at least get grounded well enough in the basics to be able to go out on my own.  Tom invited me out to lunch - Boston Tom (not Frankpipe Tom or CT[naked]Tom) - and we hung out in the park after gobbling some Thai food at a place around the block from me.  After that little break [thanks Tom] it was back to my apt and Frankpipe's website. Sleep overtook me shortly after I sat down and tried to wrap my mind around the web work. I napped and, waking up an hour or so later, I picked up  urlLink Abby  and hung out with her or a while. It felt good to play - 'specially with my newly obtained amp. I heart distortion :)  Anywho...  I got back to my "webbery" and, after a time,  urlLink this  was born. That was where my work stopped for the day.  It was time to make sure I stayed regular.  Woody's had a few more people than usual - no matter. I copped a seat and whipped out Palm Sunday. The PBR came and went and so did I. I ran into Sean on the way into my building and we took the elevator [of infinite doom] up to my apartment. Conversation ensued... and continued well into the night. The topic? Purpose... Direction... all those things.  ...and now I'm beat.  tomorrow night, I'm off to Central Mass for the Frankpipe retreat. I don't think posting from there will be a problem - I'll definitely have the laptop and, more than likely, there will be an internet connection of some kind available. So that's that.  Mean time, I'm gonna finish up this post and, shortly, I'm heading to bed.  tomorrow is another day.  God Bless.

      Alrighty.  All good things must come to an end and today's events were proof enough of that. We left Joe's [trumpet/vocals] house this morning after having had a long and productive rehearsal the day before. The plan was to meet up at the conservatory around noon or so and squeeze in another rehearsal before we headed off to Harvard Square for a gig.  I know I promised to add some details about yesterday but there really isn't much to say...  ..'cept that we got a new bass player and he got all of our tunes down in less than 30 min.  ..all of them.  The kid is remarkable.  So back to today's rehearsal...  We rocked out for about an hour - we were still beat despite having gotten a good night's rest and we decided to call it quits a little earlier than we had originally planned. I went back to the apartment for a shower and some rest and, before I knew it, I was waking up and getting dressed [in my BCB best] for the gig in Harvard Square.  We rocked...  ...hard as hell.  2 sets and 23 dollars later (including a 5 dropped in our bucket by some awesome guy) we packed up and went our seperate ways for the most part. 3 of us decided to get a bite and discuss the gig.  We had done so well... many people were impressed and, what's more, we got a fair amount of people asking us for CD's. The band, in it's current form, had existed for less than 24 hours...  ...rock...  We even got an offer from a guy who wanted to design our website for free.  [money]  So that was good. We chatted about that and some other things while munching on our whatevers at a PIzzaria Uno's around the block from the NEC.  A dude tried to sell us all crack.  Apparently, if you don't smoke crack, you're gay. He "put two and two together" as he said.  Wow.  I got a ride home from Tom and, after some goodbyes, I headed up to my apartment.  I'm not so sure that I'm coming back to CT. We'll see. More on that later I suppose.  For now, I'm still jazzed about the awesome job we did [kickass!] and am preparing to maybe get to bed early - early for me anyway.  Another day's journey all but done...   [zzz...]

      Yesterday (Thursday) was fairly tame.  I woke up and, after showering and such, headed over to see Mike Winograd [sax/vocals/baffonery] to discuss his band's website. It was about a mile walk to his apartment across wavy baking concrete and past smoldering buildings. My sweet Jesus do I ever love summer. I got to his apartment and we talked shop for a while. I learned what Yiddish is [joy], had a midday shot of JD [wow], and then it was back to my apartment for some "webtastic funnery".  I forgot the power chord to my laptop at his apartment.  He wouldn't be back until late.  There was no way in hell I was resorting to the iMac.  [damn it!]  So, except for a brief freakout, I sat there in my apartment and read. Which wasn't bad. I now have copies of "Dude Where's My Country" and "Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them".  It was likely the most leftist afternoon of my life.  Eventually, I got a call from Mike and, armed with Sean, headed over there to retrieve my power chord... exciting, I know.  After that, I pretty much chatted with Sean unaware that the night was disolving into a pale dawn. By then, we were both insane with exhaustion and sleep was inevitable.  [ZZZzzz...]  ...and today?   I woke up fairly late [yes!] and jumped right into "Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them"... brilliant work, Mr. Franken. Then it was and afternoon/evening with "The Eyes of the Dragon"... oh and a nap... and a bunch of hot dogs... so...  yeah...  I mean that was it - I chatted up a bunch of folk online, read some more, listened to the Avenue soundtrack  [Dobber: Take her home, she's wasted!] [Dexter: YAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!!!]  and that's about that. It's 9:30 on a Friday night and I have no plans to speak of for the evening. How sad (and rare) is that? S'ok mostly. I'm all about reading and, for the time being, I may just occupy myself with that. Tommorow may include a visit from my brother and [crossing fingers] a trip home.  We'll see... for now, I'm gonna head back to the kingdom of Delain. Regicide and conspiracy await...   [distracted...]

       By now I’m sure that most of you realize this... when this blog goes more than a day without updates, it’s safe to assume that I’m in CT visiting.  I’ve been in CT visiting.  So there…  Alrighty - the silence ends here.    6.26.2004 – 6.30.2004 - Saturday Night Leaver   Saturday was very much like a  urlLink bad porno  - not really that hot, terribly long, and horribly boring.   [I'm looking at you, Snatch Adams...]  I ended up talking with Pete (Matt Peters) and, wouldn't you know it, he came up... I mean... wow. So... there you go... huh (awesome!). So he came up and, after I got over my initial surprise (and after giving him about 3 tours of my apartment), we were off to see the city. It was a lot of me saying  "...and this is where I..."  or  "...that's where they..." ... I was the city's worst tour guide. Pete seemed to enjoy himself.  We stopped over at Woody's and had a pizza and some beer - thank you Pete... [hug].  It was then back to the apt where we met Sean and relaxed a bit on the roof playing guitar.  ...and then Pete said " urlLink casino ".  That's all it took really.   Granted, there was a bit more to the conversation but, for my fingers’ sake, I’ll leave it at that.   To the casino! [ kapwing! ]  By the time we crossed over into CT, I was asleep and all hopes of lining the natives' pockets with sweet hard earned American cash had faded to nothing. So be it. Pete dropped me off at my old Apt and, with a little effort, I went to bed. The next week was a collage of video games, barbequed whatnots, sleep [my preciousssss], and a whole lot of Flash MX… so… yeah. That’s where I’ve been for the last week.  Sorry about that.   ”But Dexter!” , you cry,  “What of your triumphant return to Bean Towne? .  Well… it’s like this…   6.30.2004 - 7.03.2004 - On Beyond Pabst, BCB Magesty, and The Buck Stops Here   Henry picked me up at the apt and brought me up to Boston. We  urlLink hit the bar … hard… [ouch]… Thanks Henry…  So yeah, I got back on Friday, partied hard with Henry (it was his birthday celebration) and woke up on Saturday in time for a Rockout[!] festival like none other.  Finally, the  Boston City Band  was playing Middleford.  [Hallelujah Chorus]  Can you say bucolic Christian paradise? And free soda at the end of the parade? – [sigh] - What a wonderful slice of Northeastern Americana! For my money, it doesn't get any better than Jesus and tractors [insert club remix of Plowin' with my Savior by DJ Whatshisnuts]. Anywho, the parade was decent and fairly uneventful. Which was kinda disappointing. THE  urlLink vendor  was spotted at least once and I was secretly hoping for a follow-up battle. Unfortunatlly, it was not in the cards.   [le sigh]  After taking advantage of the sweet free sodee-pop, The  BCB  packed it up and moved it out. Back in Boston, we went our separate ways and I prepared Casa Drew for Chris Buck’s arrival. I had almost forgotten that he was coming up. Buck showed up and, wouldn’t you know it, I had been invited to a party at Kyle’s [Sean’s older brother] place.  Sweeeeeeeet.  We ate din-din at Woody’s [god bless you bacon and pepperoni pizza!] and then high-tailed it to JP for some buffoonery.  I got the worst case of  urlLink hiccups  of my life. Hands down.  I can’t really describe it better than that except to say that it was plain awful and I had “massive nuclear meltdown” heartburn. I was hiccupping every 15 seconds and letting out these horrendous “half-burps”. Jesus. What a bad scene. Sleep couldn’t come fast enough.  And now? – As I write this, it’s 5:42 in the morning on the fourth of July, Chris Buck is sleeping like a lil’ baby Jesus on my couch, and my day looks something like this:   9amish – 11ish  Mom is visiting and we’re going out to breakfast. That’s right… mom is visiting. I have so much crap to clean/hide.   11amish – 6pmish  Parades! Parades! Parades! What a whore I am… 2 parades today on this, our independence day [cue patriotic music]. If I didn’t so desperately need the money I swear… though in all honesty I’d probably still do a few here and there. I mean, heh, I’m not above the BCB, baby. [fo’ shizzle]   6pmish - whenever, baby  Chris Buck and I are going out for a night on the town... a night we won't soon forget! [insert 80's power rock ballad here]  urlLink Jillian's  fits into our plans somewhere. Evening, thy name is Jackassery!   Anywho, that about wraps up this edition of Boston Bloggery. I apologize for the super long wait in between postings. Sometimes the blog-fingers need a break.  [?]  You all take care – I go to shock the world… I go to march with the BCB…  [tears of non-specific triumph]    Send all questions/comments/death threats to DexterAML@yahoo.com - you'll be glad that you did. Oh, and make the subject line "Boston Chronicles" or some such thing. If it looks like spam, I'll just delete it.

      Ok - let review...  According to my  urlLink last post , my schedule for today ( in italics ) was as follows:    9amish – 11ish  Mom is visiting and we’re going out to breakfast. That’s right… mom is visiting. I have so much crap to clean/hide.   That never happened. My aunt, who would have tagged along, had car trouble which translated to no visit from mom. It was disappointing but so be it. I'm sure she'll make it up some other time. And we at least got some phone shennanigans in leiu of a person to person visit. For now, I'm willing to be content with that.    11amish – 6pmish Parades! Parades! Parades!  What a whore I am… 2 parades today on this, our independence day [cue patriotic music]. If I didn’t so desperately need the money I swear… though in all honesty I’d probably still do a few here and there. I mean, heh, I’m not above the BCB, baby. [fo’ shizzle]   Well now... here's how  that  dance of shame went down...  We met up at the good ol'  urlLink NEC  (standard) and headed off with absolutly  no idea  of how to get where we were going (also standard). After some slick maphandling skills on my part [translation: I found the town on the map - big accomplishment for me] we were headed west to the town of  urlLink Sudbury .  Despite the cops who, all of which, seemed to be entirely uninterested in giving us directions to either the start of the parade or a place where we could park, we found a place to seat Tom's oh so choice Volvo and we unloaded. 10 min later, freshly shirted, shod, and bearing instruments, we trucked over to meet the rest of the band.  It was hotter than a lesbian daisy chain outside. The sky was a hectic blue and the sun glared mercilessly down on our motley crew. Needless to say, after about 40 yards, we were panting and sweating. A lil' group of politically inclinded Sudburians saw our plight and offered us ice water. God Bless them. Soon after, the bands (Wooster Brass and Boston City) formed like Voltron and we set out for to make a spectacle of ourselves.  The parade, though long and brutally hot, was awesome. Every 5 yards, someone was offering us ice water. The crowd not only smiled and waved but cheered and clapped along to whatever we happened to be playing... including the cadance. Barbeques burned, cute children were in abundance, and we were encouraged onward by a sea of amiling faces. I've hardly ever seen a more appreciative crowd - never with the BCB.  Don't get me wrong now, kids. The parade was still a hellish nightmare festival (again, standard). However, Sudbury definitly made me feel appreciated.  Hail to thee, fair Sudbury!  The parade ended without much hullabaloo and, you guessed it, it was off to parade number two - this time in  urlLink Norwood . This one wasn't nearly as inviting as Sudbury.  The parade was set to begin at 4:30 which fit perfectly into my earlier made plans to hang out with Buck from about 6 on. When we got there, we found out the parade had been moved up an hour to 5:30. No Biggie. Then we waited around forever - well past 5:30. My plans with Chris (Buck) were shot to hell. Finally, after an eternity or two, we were on the parade route and doing our Boston City bestest to "hype the crowd". About midway through [stopped on the route - hindered by a troupe of gypsies - hand to god] our Tuba player somehow got a fan club. A bunch of [hopelessly adorable] kids came up and were standing off at a bit of a distance trying to figure out what the hell it was that he was carrying. He did a great thing... he scared the bejesus out of 'em by growling in a huge voice through the Sousaphone and chasing the little kids. It was wonderful. He played with these kids until it was time to move on. The kids were deliriously happy. The Tuba player earned a bit more of my respect. What a swell guy. We finished up the parade without incident and, after a few hangups (totaling a little more than an hour), we were on our way back to Boston. By now it was about 9:20 PM and I would have gotten back to Boston by around 9:45 had we not run across that damned Krispy Kreme.  It's even better than you can imagine.  We walked in, brought our instruments, played, and got 2 dozen doughnuts.   Free.   Clearly, no one can resist the power of the BCB. After that, it was off to home for me.   6pmish - whenever, baby Chris Buck and I are going out for a night on the town... a night we won't soon forget! [insert 80's power rock ballad here] Jillian's fits into our plans somewhere. Evening, thy name is Jackassery!   I was met by a calm and understanding Chris Buck on my stoop. I was more than 3 hours late and, though it had been out of my control, it still sucked hard. There was really only one option for us at this point.  We went to  urlLink Jillian's  - three stories of beer, pool, bowling [that's right] and a number of other fun things - and right next to  urlLink Fenway !. Jillian's is HUGE! Bigger than all the Uconn bars combined... easily... and on three floors, my friends. We ended our night with beer, chicken, and billards.  Good times.  Home was a short walk away. Just how short, you ask?    [note: if the image doesn't show, visit  urlLink http://www.frankpipe.com/fenwayjillian.jpg  to see what I'm talking about.]  Which brings me to now... tired yet content and staring down the barrel of another parade in the AM. Wish me luck, kids. For now, I'm heading to dreamland.   Zzz...

      Today, the BCB went over to bless the town of Needham with our sultry siren song repetoire of ill fated obscure military marching band compositions. All towns should be so lucky. Oh, and we had a dozen of the Krispy Kreme donughts left from  urlLink the day before . And the parade promised to be short and sweet. So... awesome! We drove over and found the town with little trouble. It was parking that was a problem.  There were  clowns  in the parking lot.  2 troops of  clowns .  My heart was set to "hummingbird".  No matter - the clowns didn't give us any trouble. We warmed up a bit, got into our parade block and marched a very short [and friggin wet] parade. The rain wasn't all that bad seeing as how the parade was mindlessly short. When it was all over, we collected our checks and started the short trek back to our cars.  ...and then there were clowns...  On the way back to our car, we saw a pair of them - one on a clown bike and one on foot in those super evil clown shoes that they wear. Crestfallen and soaked (due to the rain... which made their make-up streaky and all the more frightening) they ambled down the road in the same direction we were headed. Mike Winograd [Frankpipe - sax/vocals/keys] whips out his clarinet and plays a "happy clown song" to cheer them up. They ignore us entirely. This was not taken well by Jesse, one of our number, who immediatly busted out with "Everybody hates clowns!". The clowns hung their heads in shame and continued walking (all the more depressed) back to their car.  Back at the cars, we began stripping of the Boston City Band getups and putting on our "less dignified" street clothes. The clowns were there too, though they showed no sign of changing clothes any time soon. We still had donughts from the day before, thank God, and a mini snackfest broke out.  Something about the doughnuts spooked the clowns.  The clowns parked near us saw the box of donughts and  FLIPPED OUT  - hard. They started by talking amongst themselves in some "other" language [Clownese or something] all scary high and creepy. It was all so surreal. Finally, they reached some sort of consensus and one of them [their leader?] screamed:   "Donughts! Attack!"   ...in a crazy high shrill voice.  If my pants weren't around my ankles, I would have gotten the hell out of dodge right then and there.  Thank God we left soon after. They had started hitting on Jesse (who is 14 years old by the way - they hit on him more when we told them this) and it was clear that it was time to get gone. We escaped with our lives [whew!] and made it back to Boston in one piece. I retreated to my apartment and promptly passed out.  The rest of the day was clown free; Spider Man 2 (wicked awesome), some decent potato skins, and now this - posting. Tommorow is looking to be fairly uneventful and I'm looking forward to that. Though I wouldn't mind an adventure or two...  ...so long as there are  no clowns ...  zzz...

      Ok, kids. Here it is, as promised – a small list of the strange and wonderful cast of Bostonites that I’ve met since I’ve been here. I’ll try and lump them into relevant groups so you all don’t get lost. Let’s get started.   Frankpipe!   Frankpipe is the reason I’m in Boston. We’re a Zappa-esque rock band with damn near innumerable influences. Here is Frankpipe in no particular order…   Sean Frenette  Best friend since high school – wicked guitar player – mildly eccentric – lead guitar   Joe “Jomo” Moffett  The Pipe’s front man – awesome trumpet player – balls to the wall insane and funny – trumpet/lead vocals   Mike Winograd  Token Jew – best clarinet player I’ve ever heard – pop music fanatic – sax/keys/vocals   Dave Goodchild  Frankpipe newbie – ungodly talented bassist  – ridiculously quick study – bass   Thomas Monaghan  Buthole Bob – sick percussionist – BCB demigod – drums   Me  Dexter aka “The Rev” – struggling beginner guitarist – negro extrodinaire – trombone/vocals     The Boston City Band/Wooster Brass Band/Windjammer Band/etc.    These are all actually the same band technically speaking. I won’t get into it here. Check out my  urlLink previous post  concerning that whole deal. Here they are in no particular order:   Trombone Nazi(s)  - one of the many old men who play drum major from within the ranks of the BCB. They calls the tunes, they bark the starts and stops, and they critique your playing and marching no matter how awful they themselves are. Nothing is “Boston City” enough for the Nazis. Oh, and if you couldn’t tell from their title, they all play trombone. They’re never really referred to by name.   The Bunny Hat Lady or Madame Vericose  -  crooked teeth, large glassy eyes, tired sallow skin, and a healthy crop of varicose veins are all her trademark features. She wears the drum major uniform but, trust me, kids, she is anything but a drum major. She, too, barks commands or, on occasion, blows her whistle. She may or may not do either in tandem with one of the Trombone Nazis – and, by the way, ALL commands given by her or the Nazis are not at all in time. She wields this drum major mace like some geriatric ninja. I would not be surprised if she had a bad case of jaundice or the gout… or both. On her head, she wears this ultra-fabulous fluffy white super bonnet. Hence the title “Bunny Hat Lady”.   Hardcore! Drummer  - She’s been marching parades for YEARS and, damn it, she is the very definition of a hardcore drummer when it comes to parade time. Her hands are bandaged and knotted with arthritis but she plays with the fierceness of an entire snare line. Don’t get me wrong – she’s not in the same class as the Nazis or the Bunny Hat Lady. She is one of the sweetest women in the BCB – super friendly, soft spoken, always smiling, and downright loveable.   The Glockenspiel Lady  - Oh boy. What a wonder! Ok. Damn the physical description. Imagine a glockenspiel player who’s understanding of tonality is light years beyond that of most mere mortals. She plays  whatever she wants  regardless of the key signature (though, before each tune, she turns to ask the Trombone Nazi what key the piece is in). In all honesty, that may be an understatement. I have never once heard her play in any discernable key whatsoever. It’s rather miraculous. Added to that, she marches like a cartoon character and has no concept of gate turns. Good thing she marches solo in front of the band.   Russel K. Wiesman aka Russ  - The very heart and soul of the BCB – our fearless leader. Though he does not march, Russ is responsible for everything else BCB related including doling out paychecks at the end of each parade. He often follows behind the band during parades in his trademark white van. The parade life can get hectic and, as a result, it is generally a bad idea to try and talk to Russ before a parade begins. He has no time for your nonsense.     Sometimes She Burns [ urlLink SSB ]   This is Sean’s older brother Kyle’s band. They’re damn good. Check out their  urlLink website … w00t:   Kyle Frenette  – Guitar/Vocals – My other big bro… constantly looking out for me and/or filling me with beer. My storytelling skills pale in comparison.   Ken Dziok  – Drums – Nasty drummer with a heart of Pabst. Newest in a long line of SSB drummers – all around decent guy.   Miguel Paucar  – Guitar/Vocals – Miguel is probably my favorite guitar player to watch. The kid plays with freakish amounts of energy – goddamn you if you don’t dance. Rolls his own cigarettes and, again, is an all around decent guy.    Corinto Cevallos [?]  – Bass – Corinto is the only member of the band that I’ve never once spoken to or interacted with in any way. He tends to disappear after shows and I’ve only seen him at one party… so… I mean I guess that’s that.      Other Friendly Neighborhood Bostonites      Brother Blue  – He’s a multi-degree carrying, world traveling storyteller – Boston’s official storyteller, in fact. Phenomenally brilliant, gifted, and moreover, friendly and approachable. He has a storytelling session on Tuesday nights in Cambridge.   Ruth Edmonds Hill  – The wife of Blue… equally intelligent, she’s the glue that keeps Blue together and, honestly, vice-versa   Tom aka Boston Tom  – Another decent Boston fella. He’s great at killing loneliness and, what’s more, he sings. He sings and plays guitar [that’s right, Christian]. We hang out from time to time. He’s one of the only people I’ve met independent of Sean.   Colin  – Yet another decent Boston fella. He’s normally the guy I’m out to lunch with when my away message says “out to lunch” or something to that effect. He usually comes equipped with a bunch of jokes and stories – good times. The only only person I've met independant of Sean.   Woody’s Lady  – The bartender at Woody’s… she doles out Pabst like it was penicillin. She’s a big Ray Bradbury as well (among other authors) so we have a lot to talk about. Hail to thee, Giver of Pabst!   The Heckling Bum  – Believe it or not, near the NEC, there’s an angry bum. Don’t you DARE give him pennies or [gasp!] food. He will seriously bitch you out and, if you’re particularly unlucky, he’ll throw your donation back in your face. He yells at passersby who don’t give him the change he craves and, I recently found out, he lives  in a better apartment than I do . Sheesh.   Abby  – My preeecioussssssss… [my guitar]    So that’s that. Those are all the main characters that make their way into my posts from time to time. Now – how about the past two days…    7.06.2004   Ouch… ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch…  My poor body… the parades have done evil things to my body. I was so sore – sweet Jesus.  Aside from that, not much else happened. I used my day the only way I knew how… sleeping… hard.   7.07.2004   [see  7.06.2004 ] Add in lunch with Tom and, beside that, I had another long, uneventful, and somewhat restful day. Hopefully tomorrow will be a touch more exciting. Meantime, I’m gonna make the most of the rest of my day by doing absolutely nothing at all.  Ciao for now…

      I'm beginning to realize that posting every single day may not be possible. In fact it's downright impossible sometimes. I'm just far to distracted, tired, hungry, etc. So that's that. I'll ask my regular readers to forgive me...   Moving on...  This past week was fairly interesting. Sasquatch's visit was nothing short of awesome. We wandered arounf the city taking in the sights, lunching, sipping at beer, and lounging in the apartment playing video games and generally reliving the good ol' "Squatch 'n' Dexter" days. The last night of this two day odyssey, we went to a jam session at the apartment of a mutual friend of Sean and myself a few blocks away. There we found a table laden with goodies and a bucket full of beer. People-wise, there were a number of eager musicians including 2 bass players, a drummer, a DJ, 2 vocalists, a guitarist, and a keyboard player.  We jammed the night away...  I haven't had that much fun in a jam session in quite a long time.  The next morning, it was time for Sasquatch to leave and, after a few days of contemplation, I decided to join him. Down in CT, my friends were throwing the 2nd annual Bastille Day Party.  This is, of course, where things went wrong.  I showed up with Scotty (recently freed from camp) to find several old friends, good food, decent beer, and bucket – a concoction with a rich history [read: sinister Jack Daniel’s based masterpiece]  Partying ensued. Drunkenness followed. I injured my spine. Here’s what happened.  At some point near or after midnight, Eric Bell and I decided that it would be a good idea to start wrestling. This madness, peppered with drunken laughter and embraces, went on for far too long. At one point, the lady of the house broke out the garden hose and sprayed us down. I got a decent portion of it straight up my nose.  Wonderful.  When the dust [mud] settled, Eric and I were pathetic, mud covered, grass stained, good time party boy bastards and the rest of the Bastille Day bunch were peeved to say the least. So be it. Our fun was done. At 3 AM, Scotty drove a drunk and bruised me back to his place where I promptly fell asleep on his carpet. I woke up without pants [?] and Scotty loaned me some dry clothes. Sasquatch and Dobbs picked me up and ferried me back to Tolland.  [whew!] I spent the next few days as a sore puppy on the couch.  During these days, I was trounced several times in some fairly gruesome chess matches by my good friend Ed. It was awful.  And then, one day, this happened:   Yahoo! Chess Game   White:  Drew  Black:  Ed  Irony:  [pathetic]  Date:  Thursday July 15 2004  1. e2-e4 e7-e5 2. f2-f3 d7-d5 3. d2-d3 d5xe4 4. f3xe4 g8-f6 5. g1-f3 c8-g4 6. b1-d2 b8-c6 7. d2-c4 g4xf3 8. g2xf3 f8-c5 9. c1-e3 c5xe3 10. c4xe3 c6-d4 11. f1-e2 d8-d7 12. d1-d2 o-o-o 13. d2-b4 c8-b8 14. c2-c3 d4-c6 15. b4-b3 f6-h5 16. e3-d5 f7-f5 17. d3-d4 e5xd4 18. e2-a6 b7-b6 19. d5xb6 a7xb6 20. c3-c4 f5xe4 21. c4-c5 e4xf3 22. o-o-o f3-f2 23. c5xb6 c7xb6 24. b3xb6+ b8-a8 25. h1-f1 d8-b8 26. b6-c5 h5-f6 27. c5-a3 f6-e4 28. a6-b5+ a8-b7 29. a3-a6+ b7-c7 30. d1xd4 d7xd4 31. a6xc6+ c7-d8 32. f1-d1 e4-d2 33. d1xd2 f2-f1+ 34. b5xf1 b8-c8 35. d2xd4+ d8-e7 36. d4-e4+ e7-f7 37. f1-c4+ f7-f8 38. c6-d6++   In other words, I kicked ass. This is possible the best game I’ve ever played.  And now? – I’m off to Maryland. I was hired by a company called "BestEnglishSpanish" to redo their website – it is an out and out nightmare. Phone and internet conversation were useless as far as resolving the problem goes and my boss invited me down to Maryland to meet with him and work all this out in person. Who knows? – This may be the start of something good.  One thing is for sure… I made good on my promise of a summer to remember.  After Maryland it’s back to CT for a Frankpiping good time [3 day retreat] followed by several days of performances.  I’ll update when I can – life sure isn’t making it easy.  Until next I blog...

       ok ok ok... I know... long time no post...  This time, however, there was good reason. I've just landed after a week [+] worth of adventures. I'll explain...  My boss kinda screwed me.   My boss is a great guy.  Here's how that works.  I didn't have to worry about food or anything like that when I was down there - he even made me megagigantic steak burgers. Seriously these things were bigger than your creepy uncle's drinking problem - we're talkin' HUGE. Conversely, we had agreed that I'd make about 10 bucks an hour on this trial gig and, though I made a fair amount, the agreed upon pay rate was never to be. All told, I spent close to 70 hours on that web site. I got paid 200 bucks. You do the math. I'm not upset, mind you - I had a great time and, hell, I wouldn't have been doing much else during that time anyway. I do feel cheated but so be it. It's no big loss.  Before treking back to Boston, my boss and I grabbed some stuff from his apartment - laptop, clothes, etc. He was driving me back and then heading over to Long Island. While he packed, I occasionally brought some things out to the car. Once that was all over, I sat on the couch and tried to keep myself occupied. Looking up, I noticed to police officers outside of the door. I also noticed their standard issue firearms pointed in my direction.  [expletive!]  Oh... and did I mention? My boss is an astonomy buff and has all kinds of cool telescopes and such all over his apartment. When I saw the cops, I had a small telescope in my hands; a long metallic tube that could have easily been mistaken for a weapon - namely a firearm.  (Thank God we weren't in [clan] Manchester)  I dropped the telescope and put my hands up. I was about 80% certain that I was going to be shot and, honestly, it felt kinda cool. I imagined the sound, the pain, the scar, and, most importantly, what an  awesome  story I'd have afterwords. I shifted slightly in my seat in a vain attempt to position myself in such a way as to minimize damage to my favorite organs. My boss came out of his room just in time and walked over to the door and TADA!, saw some cops just itching to put a hole in something. He went outside and they disappeared behind a corner leaving me to make water in my pants on the couch in this suddenly hostile town.  Everything was cool.  What happened? - Well it turns out that my boss was supposed to be in Mexico for two more weeks and his neighbors didn't know that he had come back early. They look out of their windows to see a&nbsp;black man carrying things out of his apartment with him nowhere in sight [Mexico by their understanding]. They called the cops who showed up in John Wayne mode; guns blazin' and lookin' fer tha bad feller. So that's that. The cops went away [presumably disappointed at not having been given a reason to discharge their weapons - specifically  into  someone] and I finally put my hands down feeling somewhat dejected. I should have been shot.   It would have been awesome.  Anyway, disaster averted, we hopped into the car for the 6.5 hour ride to Boston.  ... ... ... ... ... ...   10 hours later , we crossed into CT. We had left Maryland at 2:30pm. It was past 1am when we finally got to Boston.   I hate cars forever.  The next morning, I woke up and, heh, it was time to leave again. After a rough night of sleep in my apartment, I grabbed my crap [there had been no need to unpack] and headed out again - this time to Glastonbury for the  urlLink Frankpipe  retreat and a week of pipey goodness. We all met up at Tom's [see  urlLink cast of characters ]&nbsp;place and, for the next bajillion hours, we rehearsed. Don't get me wrong, it  was  frustrating but we got a lot accomplished.&nbsp;Satisfied, we grabbed a room at the Hilton to relax before bedding down for the night.  Tae-Bo happened.  It's not what you think.  Perhaps this advice will suffice:  A rock band in a hotel is like a child molestor at a day care center - you'd be a  fool  not to expect something to go horribly wrong.   The details really aren't important [though I can hear your jaws smacking and watering for details]. We rocked. We slept soundly. I snored like a rape victim.  The next day, we rocked the farmer's market in Hartford. It really was that simple.  We had to [censor] ourselves so much of the time, we felt constricted. Nonetheless, we rocked out and our fans were pleased. We even got it on tape [video and plain audio] so keep your eyes and ears out for that one&nbsp;sometime in the future.  After that gig, we packed up and went our seperate ways. I hung out at Tom's for a few days and went swimming in Cotton Hollow - a creek nestled deep in the woods of Glastonbury. I also rocked out HARD on some  urlLink Mario Sunshine  [availible on Game Cube] and generally enjoyed time with Tom's family [saints all around].  After a few days at Chez Tommy, we headed over to Upton, Mass for a gig.  Again we rocked... harder... Jesus.  Despite the 40 billion to 1 human to mosquito ratio, we kicked ass. That night, I slept at Jomo's place [see  urlLink cast of characters ]. The following night, we were to rock out at the  urlLink Middle East Club  in Cambridge, Mass. Joy. After a night at Chez Jomo, it was off to Boston to prepare for the apex of our now week long rock-a-thon.  ...  I've never rocked harder in my whole life - ever.  Best damn rock show period.  I am not leaving Boston.  &nbsp; We showed up for a 7pm sound check at 6:15 or so and, surprise, 7pm came and we weren't up for a sound check. 7:45ish we finally hit the stage for a soundcheck and we learn something pretty valuable about ourselves right away. We're damn loud. Christ. The sound guy had a face on that looked like he had seen pictures of his mother pleasuring herself with his toothbrush. After s rough few minutes, we worked out a fairly decent sound and hopped of stage. The opening band never showed up [awesome] and so we were pushed up on the list. That was fine... except 9pm came around and the house was still empty. Not... one... guest... period.  [gulp]  9:30? - Same deal and, according to the sound guy [and our original playing slot] we had to go on at 9:40... though neither the band nor the&nbsp;club staff were cool with the idea.  Whatever.  The band, undaunted, headed outside and tried to drum up an audience. We broke out into an improvised a capella&nbsp;medlely of all our songs and got a fair amount of onlookers/temporary fans but not a single person went into the club.&nbsp;[damn it!]. We still were in high spirits and decided to head in and play anyway - empty house be damned.  [If you rock out, they will come]  People immediatly began coming in the instant we began our set. How 'bout that, eh? The house actually got quite full and, damn it, the crowd was digging us. The even started singing along! And the band? We rocked harder than a priest at a boyscout camp.  [word]  You had to have been there - I won't waste your time trying to describe it to you. Suffice it to say it was one of the best shows of my life to date. I'm STILL buzzing from that show.  And this week?  Well... job hunting - I'm at the end of my cash [surprise] and have no real immediate prospects of getting more for a while so it's time to buckle down and brace for missing a meal or two. So be it! - All for the love of the city.  When I'm a rockstar, I won't ever have these problems...   [ Z  Z   Z  Z Z  rockstar ...]  &nbsp;

      I know... I know...  I'm getting worse. Almost 2 whole weeks without an update.  There's just so much going on lately...  [fade to apt. interior 12 days prior]  Immediatly following the  urlLink T.T. Bear's gig , I went over to Goodchild's place [ urlLink see cast of characters ] and well... we got rocked. We spoke of many things. Nobody was hurt. I stumbled from Goodchild's several hours later sometime after midnight through the alley behind his apartment leaving my trombone behind. The world was a giant Labyrinth puzzle and I was the steel ball.  I slept like a pre-op heart patient.  The following week was quite the blur. We were so excited about what had gone down at T.T.'s and were ready to play again - possibly another impromtu concert in Harvard Square. Our forces were divided, however. Over the course of that week at some point, Tom was in New Hampshire, Mike was in New York, Dave was in New York, Sean was in Maine, Jomo was [insert destination], and I was in my apartment. Being relatively isolated gave me plenty of time to rework a number of things on the  urlLink Frankpipe website ... which, of course, I did.  I can see some of you thanking me for not updating this blog during that time and, well, you're weclome. It was a tedious and personally exciting time but I doubt I could manage to convery that what with my clumsy command of the language.  But trust me... it was awesome :)  So that was it during that week... and then the weekend came.  [feet shuffling]  umm... I had a date.  [covering ears]  I can hear all my gal pals shrieking and cheering and whatnot. Please - it's not that big a deal. I prefer not to talk about it here - ask me over IM or in person. It was nice. And yes, Em, I managed to keep all of my clothes on AND I kept my hands to myself - lol. Anyway, as soon as I got back from the date, Henry was here.  Henry is a HUGE italian guy I met at a bar in Hartford some years back. Good friend of mine and, thankfully, most of the time, he's working. I mean literally  most of the time  - a 16-20 day is no big deal to him - construction work is to Henry as music is to Drew. But when he's finally free for a day or two, he wants to party. And it always [always!] means danger for me. This time he showed up at my door with a little black bag and a six beer headstart. I sucked it up, threw his bag in my apt, and we headed out to cause trouble.  I was reminded of my early days at UConn and Shag.  It's important to put Henry's size into perspective. 6'5" 250 or so... solid muscle vs my 5'11" 150 wirey geek frame . Oh... and he expects me to keep up shot for shot and beer for beer. Which is, and always will be, a formula for trouble.  So off we go... and I can tell you for sure that we started off at  urlLink Dick's Last Resort .  [note: for those of you who experienced the 'magic' with me in that wonderful San Antonio bar, I'd like to say that, yes, there is one in Boston and, yes, it's just as awesome - join me!]  After that, things get hazy. I did, however, learn 3 things...  ...unfortunatlly I can only recall the most important one:   Never give Henry tequilla.   I can here some of you laughing. I've heard similar decrees given by other folk but this is the very first time I've seen it pan out to something... well just plain dangerous.  Since we first started hanging out, he and all the people who knew him got all kinds of quiet when the word "tequilla" was mentioned. I thought it was all dramatic bullshit to be honest. Nobody really wanted to talk about it but they  insisted  that I not give him tequilla.  I didn't listen. In fact, he had about 4 shots thanks to me...  ...ummm I'm pretty sure he punched a guy out.  We fled the scene and grabbed a cab to some other place that was not my home [?]. We walked from that place to my apartment whereupon Henry collapsed on my bed.  Great.  I stole my blankets, curled up on the couch, and was asleep in seconds.  The morning came and, per usual, I was up at the crack of dawn. After checking my mail, brushing my teeth and washing my face, I drop kicked Henry and we headed off to The Pour House on Boylston for the best breakfast on earth. Seriously. The prices are wicked cheap [$4 for french toast and sasuage] and the food is excellent. Stuffed, we headed back to the apartment and [shock and surprise] Henry was alseep  again  in less than 10 min [Hungover much?]. About 3 hours later, he got up, packed his things, and headed off to a job in Attleboro or some place.  Good times.  I spent the rest of the day sleeping in my bed. I don't know what the hell I was trying to prove but it felt damn good.  The next day, things started happening all at once.  Over the course of this week, we [Frankpipe] got a number of emails and IM's from fans in Washington State. Apparently we have a whole lot of fans out there. Seriously. They want us to come out there to do a show. We're considering a roadtrip.  The band all came back to Boston - well except Tom who is still in CT with family. We've met in different chunks and worked on some new music here and there. Mike has written 4 new songs [jesus]. Goodchild and I are collaborating on one.  Pictures from 2 of our last 3 gigs [Farmer's Market (Hartford, CT) and T.T. The Bear's Place (Cambridge, MA)] came in. The T.T.'s shots were a little dark and tough to make use of but the Farmer's Market shots were excellent. They're  urlLink posted here on our website .  This weekend's show at  urlLink Donstock  was confirmed. Nick Amodio's band  urlLink Pachadio  may be playing as well. $4 people - IM me for more details.  I updated the crap out of the website - please,  urlLink sign up for the mailing list . Really. You'll know all there is to know as soon as we do. Plus there will be chances to win free crap! Sweet! Pictures, video, and mp3's abound.  urlLink Check it out .  That's been my week. Web geekery, Frankpipery, and such.   I hope I never leave this town.  This summer is almost over and the reality of  home v boston  is starting to sink in. In my heart I've made my choice and now, I guess, it's time to start making real life preperations.  We'll see what comes of all of this. Either way it's been a helluva ride thus far, eh? :)  And Hey! Don't be afraid to drop an IM or an email from time to time gang. I miss you guys.  Even Rockstars get lonely.   Frankly,  Dexter
