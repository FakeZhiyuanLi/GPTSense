      Why do we lie? Well sometimes we lie because we are ashamed of who we are. Sometimes we lie because we don't want to get into trouble. Well even though the first one may seem harmless, its not. If we lie to our friends about who were are, then its like your not really their true friend. We should not be afraid to tell the truth even if its embarrassing. Your friends will appreciate it. Lying to stay out of trouble, that's something that all of us have done before. I know i have done it many times and there are certain lies that i have told that im not proud off. I wish i didn't tell them and now i regret it. I won't mention what i did but to my friends that i hurt im sorry. Let me tell you why lying is very dangerous, firstly if your caught that would just put you in boiling water. Secondly if that lie is serious, you can hurt someone. Lying can do all sorts of things to the person you tell the lie too. Lying can lose a person's trust for you. Lying can make someone fell sad and hurt. Lying can make you feel bad by guilt. Lying can break up a relationship or a friendship. Lying is something that we all have and will continue to do. However even though we may lie, its better to tell the truth because if your caught, the friendship or relationship you thought you had could well be over. Depending on the lie, if its a small little white lie, im sure your friend will forgive you, but if its a lie that will hurt that person, its gonna take time and you have to convince that person that your still that person you use to be and gain his/her trust back because by lying to a person, your losing his/her trust. Trust is very important and it takes time to earn it back. I will try to tell the truth from now on even if the truth hurts, because no matter how much the truth hurts, lying is worse. I also wanna apologize to all those people that i have hurt by lying to them, im really sorry.

      What is perfection? How do you know if something is perfect? Well to me perfection comes about because of imperfection. Nothing is perfect in reality but through our eyes there are certain things that are perfect and imperfect. For example, the girl you admire or love most, you would think she is perfect because you love her and love clouds away her imperfection. Another good example would be art, if something is drawn to how the object looks like, then he would not be an artist but just someone who copies things and has no creativity. But if your an artist you would imagine the object and draw what you see, there may be flaws in the drawing but you would not care because you know that's what makes the picture look perfet.  However, some people want to be perfect but they forget that whats on the inside is more important then whats on the outside. They are just being like the blind artist, who only can copy how others look. They only care what others think of them but why do they care? The people around you like passer-bys do not know who you are, so why should you care? Instead you should look towards the people who do care. They do not care if you're fat or if your not pretty, because they know you and how you are on the inside, they love you and they dont bother abt how you look because you are perfect the way you are in their eyes. And if you change that image then many other things will change. To me i will never change how i look like because i know that how i look like does not matter.

      Russell Seah... This is one of the greatest buddies i will ever know. Gonna miss him, but instead of weeping over his absence, lets remember the happy moments that we share with him. The first time i met Russell was at parkway when i followed Thomas to go skate. He was like doing all sorts of tricks that just left me sitting on the bench. But i remember him coming up to me and asking me why i wasnt skating. I told him that he was so pro and stuff but he said it was alright cuz thats how we all start off. And from that moment onwards i knew he was a nice guy. Since then i started skating with russ and the gang and soon formed our own crew. I gave the crew the name, it was called " THE BUDDIES ". Russ has taught me a lot both in skating and in life. He has taught me how to kickflip and nollie down stairs. He has also taught me many other tricks in skating. He has also taught me many things about life, one is that you should always have faith and confidence in yourself and that you should always think positively. He has taught me that you should cherish your friends because they are like your family, THE BUDDIES are a good example, we are brothers of different mothers. Russ has also taught me how to drum and now drumming is something that i really enjoy doing. He has introduced me to many different types of music and has shown me the value of life and skateboarding. Russ is also there for me when im feeling down. He is there to lend a listening ear and help me out. He is also there to give me advice on how i should handle the situation and i really grateful for what he has done for me. I would like to thank him for all he has done for me and i wanna wish him all the best in Hong Kong. Yes the heading may seem like he is dead but he isn't, he's just migrating to Hong Kong. Anyway THANK YOU RUSSELL SEAH FOR EVERYTHING! And a little goodbye for DARRYL SEAH, you will be missed too little man. Take care of yourselves in Hong Kong. If PA is feeling rich ask him to send me an air ticket, first class to Hong Kong so that i can come visit you.

      Everyone has their own worries and pain. Why do people worry? To me worries come because we are afraid of the consequences for our wrong doing or the results of our actions. I get worried whenever I'm skateboarding because im afraid of breaking a limb. I hope never break any. I have been worried many times in my life for different reasons. One memorable one is about a friendship with my best friend, i worry that we would not be friends forever. I cherish the friendship i have with her now as i know that a friend like her are hard to come by. There have been occasions where we have had our differences but i still forgive her for her wrong doings and i hope that she forgives me for mine. I also worry about how my life would be if certain things that i have said or done to her would change certain things. I just hope the choices i have made are the best and that things could not have been better if i hadn't made these choices. I really hope to have an everlasting friendship with my dear good friend Sarah! Another common worry that some of us share is the passing of our parents. I'm really thankful for them as they have provided me with a wonderful life full of love and care. I know have been a pain in the ass to them for all the countless times that i lied, cheated, stole, was rude and disobedient to them. I really hope to change for the better so as to make life easier for them as they aren't getting any younger. The older they get the more i worry, i worry that if one of them do pass away, who is gonna help look after the family. I don't think that my relatives will can support my brother, sister and me. I hope that life would be a smooth journey ahead for both my parents.
