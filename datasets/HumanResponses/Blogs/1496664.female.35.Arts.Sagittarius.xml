      I missed the last few days of my journal. Spent the last half of the weekend in the hospital with a spastic colon ... GOD that sucks. Started a mini drawing after reading a Poppy Z. Brite book .. her first. Lost Souls. It looks pretty good and I am actually surprised! I am heading back to bed now before the Boogums get me!

       got Quake 3 yesterday. I know I know .... its an old game with an addon already... But it is one of those things that I have wanted but just never could justify spending the money on it. Anyway, I found it at Futureshop for $29.00 Canadian which I thought was a steal. My next purchase is Diablo II! Another game I just loved even though I never did honestly kill Diablo, I had too much fun running around the dungeons =] Work on the site is going ok although with quake I think it will slow down a bit =] I have a few things that I like to do when I am not working. I probably should have more and actually get a life lately but the site has taken up all my mental power. I have been planning and scheming on this thing for months.  Dragon and I are getting along a lot better and we have decided not to move but save up some money and move around December. That way it won't feel so rushed.

      ... I know that he is going to think I rejected him because I quit on the work so early in the game.... but the whole feel of what he was doing was just pornography.... (not that there is anything wrong with porn) ... but it is not what I want to express.... there are enough porn sites on the Internet and I wanted mine to be more than just pics of what was being done in the wide wide world out there. So I quit on it and am in the process of regrouping.  It seems that there is a lot of thought that needs to go into the page but very little gain is coming from it and it is frustrating. My user base has dropped a bit but I am not ready to unveil the page in all its glory (grin) because the glory of it is still bouncing around in my head....

      I realize that I have become narrow focused.  Which in some cases is good.  But I realize that it is mostly because of theWorm.  Today Dragon was trying to tell me about Ethiopian churches and I blew it off as unimportant.  But actually it would have been interesting.  But since it didn't have anything to do with Art or computers I deemed it as not something I wanted to waste time with.  I hate that wasting time has become so important to me.....

      I found out my kids computer had the SirCam virus and so did I.  Got it from a friend sending email.  I had to reformat their drive because I couldn't get it off of their's but it came off of mine ok.  It's not why I had to format my drive because it happened RIGHT after I formatted it.  But the good news is I bought the kids a CDROM for their computer and they are going nuts playing all those games that asked for CD now =]  So they are happy even though they lost all their MP3z.  For the most part the formatting here is done.  I would like to figure out how to embed this journal into my own site but my site is mostly flash and I am not good enough at flash to make it work with the instructions they give here.  I am going around again in Diablo in Nightmare mode and am really annoyed about the negative numbers in my resistance.  Is this normal or a glitch?  I feel horrible.  I am sick all the time now and creativity is pretty much down to zero.  I an not loosing weight any more and gained 5 pounds eating too many McDonald's McChickens so I am feeling pretty depressed.  I am never going to get theWorm out of my head.  He has changed my life forever and I don't even have the energy to hate him any more for it.

      Searching and writing down all your favorites and interests is a good way to get to know yourself.  Some things might surprise you.  I always envied those people with large lists of things they knew about themselves. Huge biographies and lists of interests and things they wanted to do with their lives, things they have done.....

      This was a surprise!  I was going through some interests that I could have and "love" came up ... and I could not honestly list it as a interest/favorite.  This is not a good thing!  Very interesting.  Another chuckhole in the road back to me.

      OK ... I dumped theMistressKali account and persona.  It just seemed like a persona and not really me.  Also I seem to be healing up quite a bit since leaving theWeasle.  I have started a large painting (51" x 81") and it is coming along quite nicely.  I have refrained from painting people for a bit until I can stand looking at them again with out their faces rotting.  (Although it would lend to some interesting art albet a bit biased one!)

      I am starting to have trouble sleeping.  Sometimes I feel like a caged animal, sometimes I feel like I am being beaten down by the sun.  I am half convinced something is coming to a head, and the other half thinks that the whole thing will just cease to exist.  One day I will just pop like a bubble and nothing of me will be left behind but some residue on the sidewalk.....  I took off all the banners from my site.  They were raping my art and I hate them and want them gone.  The site costs me $10 a month to run so big fucking deal if it gets any traffic or not.  If you want a decent fuck film that is tastefully done and more about erotica than merely sex go rent Henry and June.  I was lying in bed and I saw a man.  (I often see lots of images in my head right before I go to sleep.  I try to ignore them most of the time.  I don't want to be that intimate with my creativity)  I saw a man standing on the edge of a deep canyon and I watched him lean forward and fall.  Then that man was me and I was wondering what I would think on the way down.  I mean by that time your death is inevitable.  I wondered if I would be afraid or if I would be relieved.  Or would I be faced with the same situation I find myself in a lot of times.  With a lot of regrets.    Existence is so much easier than living.  No there is not something better than in the middle.    I am fucking losing it...........goodnight..............

      That's it I am done.  I am tired of flashin' today.  I figured out how to make the pages turn in flash and I am sure if I knew more about it the job could be done a lot easier.  But I have to make due with the knowledge I have.  And the knowledge I have now is tired out and can't do this anymore.  Goodnight everyone who reads my journal .... both of you =]

      The date for the wedding is tentatively set.  We are getting married on 12/12/2001 at 12:01 AM by firelight in Stanley Park at 3rd beach.  If you add up the numbers in the time they add up to 13 =]  Now this is all going to depend on when the divorce papers go through however!  But here's hoping I will be Mrs. Dragon then!

      Ok.  I found out today that I have a thing for older men.  My fiance is 10 years older than me and  urlLink inspectorjury  is my choice for Santa clause babe of the month.  I have sweated over Sean Connery and inflamed over Peter O'Toole and it never really hit me until just today.  I have the hots for older men because personally men close to my own age are too immature and some of their logic is down right silly!  Yes it is true that older men can be set in their ways.  But I am an accommodating person that doesn't have to have things my way all the time!  And there is nothing like experience anyway you look at it girls!  Unfortunately I think I scared him away with my straightforward ways though.  I sent him a Yahoo! about fishin' and made a couple posts to his page but theSpinner seems to have advanced on the little spider too fast and maybe he was afraid he would get eaten =]

      Well the bus strike is finally over in Vancouver and we got 3 days worth of free transit service.  Funny they didn't give us Friday free though!  Probably figured they would get all the drunks.  Better to put them back in cars where they belong you know.    Have you ever had those periods in your life where everything goes so perfect you can hardly believe it?  I once had a theory that life is balanced like a coin.  The more time you spend on the bad side the more good side you get.  So I figure I have been miserable for a long time.  So ... if half my life is over the rest of it should slide in like a well lubricated coconut conjac!  (its an Asian thing around here)  I haven't touched the painting since I had my epiphany however.  So I am not sure my theory of taking it easy on free on my art is going to work.  Maybe I am scared.  (Or maybe I have spent too much time at the beach and formatting this journal I paid 25 bucks to put up a background and move the links around =]  But yet I am happier than I have in years.  There is only one painting I truly miss that I don't have anymore.  The best one I ever did was one of a boat in the ocean that I literally danced with as I painted.  To David Lee Roth if I remember right.  I need to spend more time in the sun.  I am too freakin' pale!  (I need to learn to keep one track on my mind!)

      Ok.  I had some pictures taken of me and was surprised when they didn't turn out TOO badly.  Talked to a guy on ICQ today that only spoke French ... I don't speak a word of french but used this link for translation http://translation2.paralink.com/  It was the first time in years that I blushed.  Even french written is erotic!  I think this is a language I want to learn.  Many people in Canada speak french and being multi-lingual would help in becoming a citizen.

      A couple times (and in previous hardcopy journals) Dragon has asked me if I write bad stuff about him.  This is his insecurity talking and he probably wouldn't be totally the man I love were it not for these insecurities.  It presents a certain charm within him.  But I want to write this entry for Dragon.    urlLink   My Dragon, My husband, My love.  I have never loved anyone as much as I love you.  You came at a time when I needed you most and you were exactly what I needed.  I cannot imagine not ever needing someone just like you in my life.  Your quiet subtle ways, your generous heart and gentle hands are everything I dreamed I would find in someone.  When you growl it is mostly in playful ways, when you tease it is always with consideration.  I love you so very, very much.  You truly are the love of my life and I will forever remember that fact.  Yours (and I truly mean that) your wife and mate

      Something happened to me yesterday.  I woke up feeling great and something in my head had changed.  It was as if Terry (who was theWorm) didn't matter anymore.  As if he finally found his way out of my head and let go his tail around my brain and headed out the door.  And I was glad to see him go!  It feels like it didn't matter that I was with him.  I feel freer and not devastated anymore.

      what I mean by losing myself.  I have been through a sort of "cult deprogramming", only I am did it on myself.  I know this is sounding weird =[  God this sounds weird to even me.  If any of you read my journal at times I talked about a guy that I called theWorm. Living with theWorm was hell ... he had some very strange ideas about a lot of things and had some very effective programming techniques.  And after living with someone for 5 years they tend to become cemented.  When someone has been taken from a cult they are deprogrammed by pretty much wiping everything out in their brain that had to do with the cult, and in doing so leaves a pretty big hole.  The problem with that is while you are in the cult everything about what you were before is twisted around what you are becoming.  Either it is used against you or it is assimilated in a way that makes it fit within that cult.  So, when you are deprogrammed it leaves you with pretty much nothing.  And looking backwards is like falling into an abyss that you swear you will never get out of.  And writing this in the light of day when I am fully awake makes me wonder why I started this.  But I did so I will finish this quickly and get back to our regularly programmed schedule =]  So anyway, in order to leave him I took a bottle of lighter fluid to my insides, and set a match to it for about 2 months.  Then it took about 4 months to get rid of him.    I won't go into any details about the "cult" or answer any questions about it.  I can't think about it.  I have been gone from him for 1 1/2 years and I can't look back.  But in burning him out of my brain left my insides very raw.  And in healing the burns left me numb.  And lost.  They say that if something is taken out of your life it leaves a void, and the only way to not go back to it, or to just totally suffer from it you need to fill the vacuum.  You can quit smoking that way, and help with grief from loss of something special to you.  And I have tried to fill that void with my new family and by moving to another country to completely new customs and surroundings.  And for the most part I am happy.  I have no real stressors anymore and life is very peaceful.  But I am missing and my art is terribly suffering for it...........  One good thing has come from this I think.  I have realized I think what is wrong with my creativity.  Without life there is no art for me.  And I can't speak because I can no longer stand to see.  I can't look.  I can only take fleeting glimpses of the world I once knew and played in.  Because what was I was so wrapped up in the World of theWorm to look at it is like looking at the sun while pouring acid in your eyes.  And all this sounds stupid even to my ears.  Forgive the indulgence of a worn out old woman guys, and thank you for listening...............

      here is why I brought the last entry up .....   I am looking for reasons ... which is another reason I started this journal ... to help me find myself.  Again .... as if it was the first time that I have said again and hoped it would be the last.  See, I am a chameleon.  I was in a mental hospital once and they asked me "If I was an animal, what animal do I think I would be."  (yeah I know, and I wonder why I still have problems =>  )  I answered right off.  "I am a chameleon,  because I am all things to all people."  I was a lot younger with a lot more energy back then =]  I have seen through the years (through asking other people about this) that the testimony to my "chameleonness" is the fact that nobody knows I am a chameleon.  They think I am who they see me be.  Unfortunate for me I got too good at it.  I have forgotten my original colors.  I have lost myself.....  I have looked to my friends and lovers and family to help out in this department but they can only tell me what I have been to them...... and once again I find myself saying like I have when I was young and going through the mental hospital phase .... "Time is running out, I have to figure something out now."  I didn't know why time was running out then either...... but I think this time it is because the paths of my life were laid down in the dirt of the Earth I have been akinned to, and the winds of time and tide erase them quickly ... my mind is forgetting where it came from and where it has been.  I am losing myself and now I am losing the way back.  I mourn for a lot of what I was .... but the most agony comes from the sole love of my heart and soul.... my artwork.  I have mourned over the loss of my feelings, the loss of my connection to nature and a lot of other things I thought I was connected to.  But I have learned to live without them ... or at least I think I have .... But the art I cannot live without.  It IS me.  Or such a part of me that I cannot tell the difference anymore.....  I am stuck.  I cannot create.  I cannot perform and I cannot speak.  I cannot speak.  I used to speak with my hands and now I have no more words.    (more later .... I hurt)......................

      I have wondered why I started this journal and I guess it was about the same reason that others started there's.  Hoping to find acceptance in ones words, hoping someone is hearing them and reacting in a positive manner.  Hoping someone is caring about what you are saying.  I suppose.  I have read my friends page every day.  I have read your words and I have thought about you as people.... what your lives are like .... wondering if you read mine and wonder....   , I was amazed to find another woman that uses Litestep, it is such a male geek tool type of thing.  I have used it since '97 when everyone was using the wharf and MorpheousX changed the way we look at themes and themeing.  I have wanted to ask you for a screenshot of your desktop and wondered if you are in DeviantArt?  Which brings me to  .  I have admired your work a LOT since I found your webpage a couple of years ago.  I remember agonizing over the long wait between dragons ... but understanding because I have a website of my own that comes from my soul ... or at least it did back then.... I know how hard it has been for me to forge something of myself (both in the making of myself and in the "part of myself" sense of the word).  Bajema IS on Deviant, at least a recent addition.  The site came out with its "art" and "application" slogan soon after I made my first theme for Litestep with the slogan "merging Art and Application" for my thePheonix() theme.... I was tickled.  I still visit even though the images load so damn sloooow!  =]  I have wanted to introduce YOU to Litestep for some time now.  I think your sensitivity and vision would lend a great deal to the skinner/themer world... and with you so into computers and art I think you would get a big kick out of Litestep as your desktop..... I have had a lot of fun themeing for it...  (See I watched Magnolia last night and it has made me think of how we are all linked together ... or not =])     ... I have watched you agonize over the loss of your wife and the moving of your family and it has made me think about a great many things....  About how I am 10 years younger than my Dragon love and I have raised my kids to want to be forgers in their life ... so I know they will leave all too soon leaving me in a full identity crisis because .... well ... what else do I truly have to "be", you know?  I have been a mother for so long I wonder anymore if there is anything else ... and if I really want there to be.  Where do you go and what do you do when your reason to keep moving forward is gone?  I have wanted to suggest a good many things but who the heck am I to tell someone that obviously deserves respect and care due to their wisdom, intelligence, and the fact that they have worn out a more walking shoes than I have worn so far?  But I have so badly wanted to suggest maybe a roommate that needed you might be helpful?    .... I want to tell you ... your body is beautiful... I very much look forward to seeing your photos in your journal as you seem to typically un-male but obviously so.... thank you for sharing... but to be so obviously female seems so insulting but I have so terribly wanted to ask you if they put something in the water in Columbia that they sure didn't where I grew up and was dating..... (blushing here)  You are such a peaceful human being and I mean human being in all its sense.  I like your down to earth.... and the stars you keep looking at that you probably don't realize live in your eyes =]    - I know someone that is so much like you .... her heart hurt much like I have heard yours such speaking.  I wanted to tell you that it is going to be OK.  I have seen her quiet strength persevere through so much.  I have wanted to say, please realize your strength IS the same sensitivity that causes you so much pain.  To kill one is to kill the other .... be careful.  The thing that makes you so strong is the thing most people would say was weak.    ... you seem to tender right now =[  I wanted to tell you also that it was going to be ok.  It is the differences that make us interesting and wonderful =]  It is why I always smile in glee at Baskin Robins ... 31 flavors is what makes life special =]  And there are those out there that think so =]

      Hot pastrami on fluffy white bread with mozzarella cheese melted on top is good.    I had this fight with T the other day.  She wants more deeper intimacy with me.  I am horrible.  She has been there for me and keeps telling me that I am not the only one that has been hurt.  I feel like she is telling me that she has been there for me and she is hurt too so it is my time to give back to her.  The problem is I don't think I have what she wants me to give anymore.  So many road inside myself have been shut down and abandoned.  The weeds have taken over and the roads are gone leaving no trace of how to navigate the area any more.  And it is not like when you are growing up making the roads of who you are that you make a map along the way. =[

      I noticed that since Dragon's mom died I have not posted much.  Most of the time I just want to browse and sleep now.  I think I broke a pattern that was sustaining me and now can't establish it again.  I spend too much time on the net.  I went rollerblading yesterday for the first time since spring.  I have barely been out of the house unless it was with Dragon.  What is wrong with me?  It is easier to sit here.  I feel like I worked 3 jobs the last 5 years with Terry and raised 6 kids.  I feel worn out still after a year and a half of being without him.  Maybe I am too happy.  But I just don't want to think about all the things that happened anymore and all the things that was said while I was with him.  I am mentally tired I think.  I was brainwashed for 5 years and now that I have most of it cleared out I am empty and scared about what to fill my head with.  Thought shy like gun shy I guess.

      School started on the home front yesterday and time has been short for most things.  It seems like I just get up and I am going to bed.  I homeschool my kids so  everything  is up to me.  We are in a heavy curriculum this year because I am preparing them for taking their equivalency test in a couple years.   urlLink Myka  is 14 and  urlLink Britty  will be 13 in a few days.  (Myka will be 15 in January)  I just can't believe that.  I remember vividly when I was 15!  15 was a rough year FULL of changes.  It was after a year of serious contemplation about myself.   The year I won beauty queen and all the kids boo'd.  The year Kurt Stephenson broke up with me.  I thought about him all year long.  He was my first true love.  Funny 15 years later I found out he had came over to my house looking for me just after I had left home and I cried.  Imagine crying about someone 15 years after they leave you.  He was a chicken shit anyway.  Broke up with my in a Dear Jane letter.  Kurt, if you ever read this I think you are a chicken shit and give me back my sophomore yearbook!  It turns out he married April Robinson and had 3 kids.  She is like some ideal mother into heavy parenting issues.  (And he broke up with me because he thought I was a boring stupid airhead) It still hurts.  Breaking up with Kurt has hurt all my life.  Mostly because I never quite understood why.

      I am sitting here with $12.00 of smoked salmon, $10.00 worth of prime BC bud and I am thinking about my last entry =}and it doesn't take a whole lot a pot to see the connection here! =]  I have to say that BC bud is nice.  American pot always seemed way too harsh to me.  It always had a nasty little edge to it.    Ok come on give me a break ... I have to have something to give this massive unit I call a brain a break!  They say you should never write while you are stoned.  But this journal is such a catharsis for me that I decided I will allow my hair to come down for just this once in an environment that is a cross between writing in a paper journal with a lock and hiding place and just totally taking ads out in the paper, buying space to tell my soul!

      I have strange dreams.  Like, what most people would consider nightmares I consider adventure dreams.  I dream a lot about being chased by things that want to kill me for some reason or another.  I have to use my wits and my speed to stay one step ahead of them, or my strength if I am caught.  These dreams I consider playing in my sleep.  I play too many RPG's, on the computer and around the table, I think.  What I consider play dreams now used to be my nightmares as a kid.  My nightmares now are something else.  My nightmares now are me dreaming about blatantly true life..... sometimes they show up symbolically but for some reason are always pretty obvious to me in their meaning.  Like one time I had a dream my mother was half naked sitting on her bed, and she was very skinny and tiny looking (my mom is only 5' being half Polish half Irish)  She was shooting up.  She was looking down at her arm and slid a needle into a vein and injected herself.  Then she looked up with tears in her eyes, went all glassy eyed and collapsed softly, crumbling to her side.  The look on her face as she collapsed was a reflection on how she felt about life.  My dad is an alcoholic and beats my mom and generally makes her life miserable with his ranting around the house all the time.  It got 100 times worse when he lost his job of over 30 years.  He never bothered much to get another one.  He just stayed at home to terrorize my mom.  I think about the way life must make her feel, being so tiny against such a vicious animal, and for the most part, even though my mother is a very strong, very capable woman, life must feel very draining and very sad to her.  Life was the drug in her arm see.  It withered her and made her very sick, but it was a choice.  I never wanted to admit that it was her choice.  I never understood why she stayed with him.  I just remembered feeling very confused about the whole thing and waiting for the day when whatever it was keeping her there would go away and she would come live with me and he would go away...    My dad has tried to knock me around a couple times, but I usually knock him on his ass and for some reason, having someone fight back usually takes all the violence out of him.  One time I called the police after he beat my mom but she wouldn't admit to the policeman what happened.  It showed me then her life was a choice.  And I am hoping maybe it showed her that I love her.  But no matter how cut and dry it looks here in black and white it made a very big impact on me.  I mean ... how do you stomach such a thing?  I was leaving my mother to the hands of a monster that day.  I was so desperate to save my mom but seeing her look me in the eye then looking at that policeman and telling him nothing happened, THEN standing there while my dad had the policeman escort me off their property ...  it made me realize that I could not force her to go.  She had made the choice to stay for whatever reasons, and while it was difficult for both of us to live with the decisions she makes, it wasn't me putting that needle in her arm, and there was very little I could do about it except sit and watch and be there for her.  My mom had it bad against the odds too.  I have been divorced.  But most of my family stay together forever.  Its just the way its done.  We probably have the lowest divorce rate of any family I know.  My grandparents families celebrate 50 and 60 year wedding anniversaries as common as retirement parties.  Mostly if someone is not with the mate they married in their early 20s it is because the mate had died and they usually stay then with a new mate if they get one.  My mother had a lot to live up to and I realize that, but in a way seeing her struggle to make life work in spite of my dad made it easier for me to divorce my husband when I realized he was a deadbeat drug user.  I did not want to find myself sitting on my bed crying and sick when I was 50 because my mate was a low life.  I learned the hard way, and after too damn many bad men, that you make the choice wisely before you mate for life.  I mean sometimes you really can't know, about what your mate will be in the future.  But generally I think with a little thought you can tell.  Like taking a hard look and evaluating honestly your mates behaviour.  Stealing the last $20.00 I had for diapers to buy drugs and Pepsi's should have been a dead give away.....   I don't know why I didn't see it at the time..... maybe I was too busy dreaming about life sucking evil moster dudes instead of seeing I was living with one?  I am ironic like that =]  Oger invasion on the home front?  No problem!  I eat me wheaties with them every morning. "Have another bowl of alien space dudes honey?" ... but the real world ... those are my nightmares ...  gets me every time .... keening in my covers, blinking back tears and bile ... convincing myself to drag in every breath ... you're awake now .... Just breathe, breathe......  I wake up in cold sweat with life staring me right in the face saying, "See, See!  For all your strength and answers, Sheena, you are a worm!  A soft bodied little worm on the sidewalk drowning when it rains ....  you are insignificant compared to My power..."    It sucks when closing your eyes gets as bad as opening them ....

      So we were walking along Dragon and I, just minding our own business.  We were going to the hardware store to buy legs for the couch his brothers delivered without them.  When we walked out of the store and there was this black rabbit sitting on the side of the parking lot eating grass.....  Now, living in Vancouver you would not believe the incidents of wolves and other predatory animals we get here.  And that doesn't include the cars!  So I am thinking ... someone has lost their pet (or chucked it after the Easter wore off it) and by morning it is going to be some kind of pizza, whether pavement  or snack.  So here I go on this crusade to save this rabbit.  I don't know about you but it is damn near impossible to catch a rabbit (by his toe or otherwise).  Our only saving grace (and his) was the fact that he decided to hide amongst the piled up skids that were in front of the hardware store.  As it was, it took us a full 2 hours to trap it so I could grab it.  Now, almost $200.00 later .... we got a free rabbit.  No one can decide what to call it (It is a male Mini Rex, one of the Velveteen rabbit breeds)  I call it Cinder Rabbit,    wants to call it Hobo,   wants to call it Evil but we all just wind up calling it Funny Bunny for the most part.  It has ear mites ... So time for a trip to the vet as rabbit mites can be severe and very hard to eradicate.  Welcome to pet ownership ... I wonder what the Rottie will think of it when we buy it in March?

      I haven't posted for awhile.  My last comments weren't met with much success on my end.  I had another dream about painting last night.  Although this one was a little weird.  It was about Christ and turkey (Monday was Thanksgiving in Canada).  Although Christ and Thanksgiving don't really relate to each other.  It was about this traveling evangelist that I thought had a good message in my dream.  He was getting discouraged and was going to give up on helping the world in his way.  Because people were so ungrateful and generally angry and very negative most of the time when he dealt with them.  I drove down to the states and found him in the parking lot at a Safeway and I told him "Of course people are negative and degrading when they come to you, it means you are doing something right.  Christ himself would not become some famous fancy preacher because he said he preaches to those that need his help not those that don't"  It meant he was attracting the people that he needed the most and that needed him the most.  I was painting a picture of Christ being crushed, and scenes of him being hung upside down on the cross with "turkey is more important" written on the crossbar.   Who knows.  I am not a religious person but mainly because I don't see how being religious has helped most people.  For the most part the more they get into any religion the more they seem to judge those people that are not of their religion.  Needless to say I don't really believe in God as a whole.    and I were talking about this last night before bed, she asked me what I believed.  I told her that I believe God is everything but pays very little attention to the meanderings of any one person or groups of persons.  For the most part we are like cells that run through blood veins, or even skin dander.  I said that doesn't mean you can't affect the way things work through means not usually applied day to day.  Whether it be prayer, chant, or magick.  But that I also think that the message that God would give to his people would be a lot simpler than it has been said.  Anyway, there is no purpose to this post.  Just rambling.  Meet   BTW.  She is the gf I talk about in my journal.  She is coming up for a visit October 18th.  It's been nearly 3 years since I have seen her.  I have known her for 4 years this November.  Probably the oldest friend I have.  My life changes a lot.....  I can't say what I will be doing from one year to the next.

      Dragon and I had a fight last night. He doesn't want me to go to club inferno because he is afraid I will find someone more interesting there and leave him. Let me tell you something .... don't ever leave someone to be with someone else even remotely... because they will fear that you will do the same to them forever! We managed to get calmed down enough to have sex and he did the one thing I think no man should do after fighting with their woman. Fuck her and fantasize that she is something else. And then fantasize about the one thing she is insecure about also!  Fucking can be an emotional time for a woman (I have managed to staunch that part of me for the most part) and especially after a fight. If you are the type to have sex after a fight please remember to use that time to bond again, not to establish breeding rights!

      Before my last bf I believed in living Poly (being in a Polyamorous relationship....) But it seemed that in the case of my last relationship the male side of the relationship just took it as a way to collect more females for a harem where each female played a role of his choosing for his own good. And I seemed to be the one that went without sex in favor of serving him his dinner and washing his clothes. Other males were not allowed BTW. So now that I am on the other side of the relationship (being that it is over for a year now) I am struggling with my own fears and they are getting in the way of the relationship and growth. I am not as sure as I used to be that not sticking to the traditional monogamous relationship is such a bad idea.... especially with all the insecurities that I have. It seems that doing what you wish because you can hurts a lot of people if you do not temper it with just because you can doesn't mean that you should.

      and when it isn't it is called perversion? =] Just a little observation to explain that to each their own and definition of where to draw the line is relative to who is involved and the whims of the time.  I have been involved in BDSM for several years now as well as 3 separate 3sms and I can honestly say that while some things are different much remains the same. We are human beings as ever and much is static in our behaviour. We deal with the same jealousies and feelings of inadequacy and fears no matter if someone is holding a whip over our backs or serving us a TV dinner while we watch Archie Bunker.  One thing that people don't think about when they fantasize about 3sms is that we are not dealing with fuck faces pasted on the air of our minds while we jack n jill. We deal with multi-faceted human beings with moods and ideas in a changing fickle world. If you think one relationship spins your head and stirs up your world ... just imagine how a relationship with 3 people would take a blender to it. In a 2 party relationship you deal with at least 5 relationships. You have the relationship as a whole, you have the way 1 person deals with the other and the way the other person deals with the first and then you have the way 1 person deals with the relationship as a whole and the way the other person deals with it as a whole............ in a 3sm you have at least 13 different relationships! 13!  I know what most people would say... I said it at one time myself.... "But I am not in this for relationships, just the sex and fun!" It is NEVER just sex and fun EVEN if you and your partner skip around to not having sex with the same person more than twice. It changes things in your relationship forEVER! Especially if, as a man, you just want to sleep with more than one female. Because sooner of later she is going to think of some other guy and BANG! Your dick is in an uproar and I don't mean with a pleasant stiffy! (This applies to women too!) There is no way around this.... adding another person (even if an amalgamation of many people and you and your partner) is going to change the way you look at each other and feel about each other.  As to why BDSM is appealing to people. This is as diverse an answer as to why people like a certain song or band.  First off let me explain my role. I am a switch... meaning I like to be a top as well as a bottom. I like being a top because I naturally have a domineering personality and being able to manipulate people to feel a certain way (whether by their request or my whim) turns me on. It is why I am an artist. It is why I write stories and poetry. I like to be able to make people react from a gut level before they have time to think about the correct response. And since I am a switch I get a kick knowing that I am the cause of someone feeling that feeling I get when I am a bottom.  Why I am a bottom..... First let me clarify something. I do not "like" pain. I do not orgasm when I walk barefoot down the street and stub my toe or step on glass. I do however like the endorphins released by the shock of such an event when it is by choice. Much of my life and thinking is contained in a self monitored package with all the checks and controls necessary to existing in every day society. All the while I still having this brain that composes art in peoples faces while walking down the street in that instance before eye contact is made and self preservation kicks in. And it screams when contained too tightly! But it has learned one thing..... The controlled side screams too.... and the controlled side, for all its strength and carefully finished exterior, shatters when it gets too exhausted, by whatever method ... be it pain or stress or overwork. If you cause it unpleasantness for long enough it will release and the doves will weep for joy in their cages shuttering with that pre-anticipation of unfettered flight. The innocence of lambs will frolic unknowingly in the bliss before their inevitable slaughter, completely unaware so therefore free. And I get that feeling you get after a REALLY good orgasm (the one better than the feeling you get right after a MUCH needed piss!) And through its extremes it has much the same anaesthetic effect of walking on sharp rocks with a toothache.... Bliss is found through much needed release caused by the extreme distraction the pain provides. You reach this point (by the same building process much like an orgasm) where everything else in the world is reduced to the point right in front of your eyes. And in a society where we are bombarded second by second with the colors and choices of mass advertising, millions of different songs to listen to, and sights to see...... this is an extremely profound place! There is NOTHING but you at your most real. You have been stripped naked and dropped right back into the womb. The you that you were before society got its hooks and claws into you.  Anyway ... I could go on and on but it would only be a redundant attempt to explain Nirvana through Backstreet Boys videos. It is something you have to experience. Meditation through flogging. It is said that monks and priests do it to get closer to god... and Buddhists starve themselves in fasting and sitting in dark rooms with only incense and a straw mat for comfort..... It is a place you arrive .... not a place you can go.....

      My favorite part from T2 was the writing etched into the picnic table in the desert  "There is no fate but what we make"  It suggests that we have control over our lives.  We have the ability to make it what we want to make it.... be it that we are smart, clever, ???. They say the human brain only uses 10% of its potential.  What do we do with the other 90%?  We use it as a hat rack.  Maybe we don't use it at all.  But what if there was something productive we could do with all that extra grey matter.  What if it is that part of our brain that holds the potential we have of NOT being a victim to our surroundings and people with more money or political power?  So becoming theSpinner was an attempted to turn on a few extra brain cells.  Becoming my own spinner of my fate instead of some old woman I have never met sitting in front of a loom without my name on it.

      A little further into peaceful in my mind over this thing What would I do? has been asked to me......  I would like to say I would side with peace. I, myself am a peaceful person, and would never decide that terrorism to this scale was a viable solution. (Notice I said "would" never, not "could" never. I am an animal and have many instincts that would support an act like this)  I would say round them up and do to them what has been done to the bodies in the WTC. Leader first. With followers watching. But that eye for an eye theory is what started this whole thing and what has caused the bombing of these buildings in the first place. I am not so ignorant to think that the US was an anonymous random target. We have done our own atrocities as well through the years. So this is a bad solution I think.  So would be going into the country that houses these people and declaring war. Although a temporary solution that would make others think twice about doing something like this ... the third time they think about it, they will merely think about how to do it better and how not to get caught so they can continue fighting for their "cause".  If instead we negotiate peace with these people then it will show that anytime someone wants something from the US all they have to do is terrorize us into terms.  Of course we could refuse to trade with them. But that would cause us to have to use OUR oil instead of stock piling it for when the Arabians run out of theirs. (Which may be why they are taking such sudden action now, to jack up the price they can get for their oil to cash in their cow until she dies) But the oil company would go nuts over this so its not going to happen.  I would recommend threatening retaliation and begin all out occupation tactics until the terrorists are turned over and then give them a public execution. And then start preparing for nuclear war someday soon (within the next 10 years) because this suggestion will only escalate.  We could arrest the terrorists and imprison them for study. Only by learning and knowledge can we hope to find a solution to what is wrong with OUR tactics that cause them to take theirs.  See, I live in Canada now. I left the US because there are things wrong with it that not only cannot be easily solved ... but the powers that could solve them really only want to continue them because they line their pockets and insure their children's children stay in power. And damn the consequences to the "little people". Which is exactly what has happened now. Do you think it was the stock holders that occupied the WTC? No it was the people making them rich that did. Is it the powers that are suffering right now like the families that have been devastated by actual family deaths?  Trade will go on as soon as they can find a building to put it in. Money will continue to flow. And as soon as a few weeks go past us with the news clogging up our TV entertainment we will want to hear about something else. THEN the powers will move and come up with a solution that we will never be privy to.  So what would I do if I had the power? I would apologize and then do nothing. But in the future ... I would remember that my actions have consequences and try an ounce of prevention next time so nobody gets pounded.

      01:25 pm Makes me glad that the decision on what to do about this incident is left in someone else's hands.  I would like to say however that I am sorry for what our government has decided that has hurt your country. (Afghanistan and others) I left the US after 32 years of living there because I realized a few things about "our" beloved country. I have seen our country support Iraq against Iran and Iran against Iraq and realized that the American government is an opportunist.  When I hit 18 I started to vote for who is in office but quickly realized that it was a fixed situation. Our choices are limited to who makes it on the ballot and who makes it is usually who is the richest. And they didn't get rich by supporting what is right all the time. But what would make them richer. So, there you are. You can't make a difference if you don't vote and you can't make a difference if you do.  I want to say that I never chose to help one country annihilate another. I never chose to support violence. And I never chose it to the point that I left America and moved to another country and took my tax dollars and the tax dollars of my family and future family with me.  They do bad things in America and they do good things. Pretty much like any other human being. People are not all bad, and not all good. But I can't say that if my children were in the position that some of the Afghanistan families are put in that I wouldn't be fighting back either. Just like some of the Americans are fighting mad here because their families and the families of other Americans have gotten hurt.  But it is never as black and white as some of the messages I have read here would like it to be. This is not an incident of merely "them" doing something to "us" and "us" retaliating against "them". This is an on going situation of twists and turns that many of my "fellow Americans" are not aware of and will never be aware of. Our government makes many decisions every day that 99.9% of the populace doesn't even know about and has done so for years! How can you condemn someone when you don't have all the facts? I ask that of all of you.  I don't know why who ever did this decided to take this course of action. I don't think it was right but neither do I think what is happening in their country is right. So I ask the people of the Middle East. What can be done to make your lives better? And realistically. Because writing our Congressmen and President does just about as good as pissing in a bucket to fill the ocean. Over throw our Government? There is no way we would ever get coordinated enough to do something like that. So what can be done? To stop all this hurt on your soil and ours.  I "have" done the one thing that I could think of immediately. I have educated my children and tried with anyone around me that cares to listen. I took my support away from the people that were doing this to other countries (and their own people as well) and moved to a country were many many people of different nationality seem to live in relative peace right next door to each other. My neighbors are from China and India, Europe and France, Japan and from the Middle East. All in the same neighborhood. The last loud noise I heard was when the neighbor what building a shed in her back yard and woke me up each morning hammering. We smile at each other and look out for each others houses and make sure we leave parking for each other in front on the street. What else can I do to try and make sure someday in the future neither of us has to suffer so much?  Laurie Nevard, Polish, German, Irish, American and Canadian

      Everybody is talking about "It".  And I have decided I don't want to.  I am sick over It. I don't understand It.  I am confused and penetrated and I have determined that I will never make sense of it.  I do want to say to the Arabian people.  I love your horses and your desert is beautiful.  Your people always have such kind, interesting, intelligent faces.  If someone from your country did this then I want to say I still love your horses and your desert is beautiful and I still like your faces.

      "Loneliness is the most terrible poverty."  Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person.  The ocean is made of drops.  "Man is the only animal that deals in that atrocity of atrocities, War. He is the only one that gathers his brethren about him and goes forth in cold blood and calm pulse to exterminate his kind. He is the only animal that for sordid wages will march out... and help to slaughter strangers of his own species who have done him no harm and with whom he has no quarrel... And in the intervals between campaigns he washes the blood off his hands and works for "the universal brotherhood of man" - with his mouth. Mark Twain   I have found the paradox that if I love until it hurts, then there is no hurt, but only more love. Mother Teresa  Do not think that love, in order to be genuine, has to be extraordinary. What we need is to love without getting tired.  For what is it to die, But to stand in the sun and melt into the wind?

      Today, I saw a man push a mentally handicap woman off the bus. He was about 6'4". She was about 5'3", maybe 90 lbs. soaking wet.  As I walked to the Grandvillbe bridge I realized then several things within a span of seconds.  It is not myself that keeps me alive. It is other people. I myself have nothing good to live for. I live for others.  I realize it is not me that has a problem. It is other people that have a problem. They are the ones that need help. I only need help coping with reality. People wonder why I want pot. I wonder why you don't. I wonder how you do it.    I pushed the man back. I told him he better be thanking his maker that he was not born that way instead of picking on those that were. Later I thought of a lot of things to say and do. But at the time I was just in shock. I got off the bus and cried. I cried all the way to the bridge and back. I watched people walk along happy and loaded with things they had bought from the shops. I wanted to grab them and beg them. "I just saw a man push a helpless woman off a bus. Tell your children not to push people that are worse off then they will ever be ... Where are you going??? Why are you happy???? How can you live with things like this? ??? Are you blind?!?!?!?!?!"  He called her a freak before he pushed her. He told me I looked like a freak too. After I pushed him. No one else on the standing room only bus did or said a thing. When I got off the bus people saw me bawling. Every of of them saw me crying. Every single one of them turned away and just kept on walking. They all looked the other way. I realized .... yes, they are blind.  You people tell me to cope by being blind. I believe you. I KNOW it is the only way and practiced it for a couple years now. To the point of pushing out of my life anyone who dared ask me to open myself and see. But here I am begging for help in trying to be an artist again. I cannot be blind and not beg to be able to express myself. I am lost. I am sorry Tammy, my GOD you don't realize how sorry I am. I am sorry I cannot be what you needed me to be. I can't be what I need me to be. I can't see and I can't be blind. You beg me to feel you and in every action I do and word I say I beg not to. My heart begged not to feel harder than it begs to. My whole soul is at war with itself. I have seen too much and felt too much. Please, PLEASE understand. It WAS because I could not join you. To let go always brings me to this. I have my own bridges too T, and somedays I so want to cross them to the other side.  As I was walking down the street I looked in the windows and saw my reflection. I do look like a freak. I noticed that when I left home. I noticed that there was no way I could go inside the art galleries that I set out to look in because I don't look like someone with enough state of mind or money to buy the art there. I would be asked to leave. I look like a freak. I look like someone that has lost the ability not to care. I know why I can't feel. I DON'T FUCKING WANT TO!!!!!  God... we are lost. I did not want to have children. I did not want to bring them into this world knowing what they would see and feel. Now, I work hard to keep them away from it. Because there is no coping but brutal, pain induced blindness. There is no solution to this. I wanted every person out there to go home and tell their children not to push handicap people. I would not have thought that it was a neccessity. Who would have thought that man's parents did not teach him that?  Before I got on that bus another one much less crowded was coming behind it. I almost waited, but I got on the crowded one anyway. As I passed the woman she flipped me off. Her hair looked like it had not been brushed in a week. I walked on past and stood behind this other woman and the man. As I waited for my stop I realized I was on the wrong bus. It wasn't going to stop where I needed it to stop. The small woman realized that too and yanked on the chain several times and cried out over and over. I realized she could not speak. The only sign she knew was the finger. The man explained that the bus would not stop. She of course didn't understand. She yanked the chain some more and cried out some more. The guy told her if she did that again he was going to push her head through the window. I thought. "Buddy I would like to see you try!" The little woman walked up to the bus driver and tried to get him to stop. The women in front of me turned to me and said. "Could you just back off a half a meter? I need to breathe." I thought, I don't smell and it was a crowded bus. The two guys behind me were at my back as well. I thought, god we can't even stand to be next to each other let alone help one another.  The little woman came back and stood at the door and kept yanking the chain some more. The guy called her a freak. She didn't even turn around. I think she was either deaf or couldn't understand him. The bus stopped, the door opened and she started to step out and flipped the bus driver off. The man behind her pushed her out the door onto the sidewalk. He didn't have a problem touching her. I pushed him back. We had words. The little woman got back on the bus as the woman in front of me quickly got off. The little woman pushed me because she saw me pushing the guy and thought I was the one that pushed her. I ignored her and shouted at the guy and got off the bus. He moved to push me and I turned and said. "Go ahead and try it, I'm not as retarded as she is." He told me I looked it and the bus left.  I thought about the other woman and thought. I need to breathe too. I started to pray. "God, please help us. We need help! We are losing!" I thought about that other woman again and wondered why she didn't do something as she was standing right there. I realized that she wanted me to back off because she wanted away from the little woman. I wonder if she was afraid. I wonder which one of us she thought would rub off on her. The little woman's retardedness ... or my humanity. I don't blame her. I don't want to be human any more either.  I feel sorry for the other woman. She was in between a rock and a hard place. I have learned to bite and scream incoherently like that little woman. She is me. Tammy I am sorry all I could do was babble and flip you off.  September 11th, 2001 - "Please tell my wife I love her" That is a few of the words this man in the World Trade Center said. He needed someone to speak for him. His life was over and he knew it.  Do we really, REALLY need to ask why things like this happen? Have you asked why? Go outside and watch people for a week and you will get your answer. Try dressing weirdly and don't act normal.  Or you can be blind.  Who is going to speak for those who cannot speak? I pray it will be you. I pray very hard. Will somebody answer my prayer and do something for someone today?  Because remember this: What are you going to do if you have a stroke and are rendered like that woman? Who is going to speak for you?  i told you when I saw that nun cut someone off in traffic that this world was lost.

      Neopets, the Macro Society. The whole world has got their eye on your prize and they all want it bad.  Living on this earth may be expensive but it includes a free trip to an early grave. Does every idealist turn into an opportunist? I wanted to "change the world with my message" And I wanted to do it for free.  My "future son-in-law" buys my daughters pussy with a few baubles and a "soul searching smile" . My favorite philosophy turns out to be a scam. Neopets is starting to SUCK!  Don't ever evaluate your life too closely. Once you open your eyes you can't close them again.  fiction can be more real than reality	12:40 pm Richard Bach (another sell out traitor) once said that fiction can be more real than reality  I think it is because ppl are afraid to express their true selves IRL but in fiction they can attatch parts of themselves to the icons their fantasy mind makes.  For instance. Create a "role playing character". Give it all the attibutes of yourself. Not just the good stuff but the bad as well. Go to your nearest gaming store and tell them you are looking for a DND game. Go play that character. After you get over the initial embarrasment don't you think it would be easier to do this than to walk up to a perfect stranger in the streets (or even a friend of yours) and tell them everything about yourself? Your deepest darkest secrets, exposed to the world for all to see an ridicule?  ------------------------------------ BTW - Richard Bach, Leo Buscaglia, Thea Alexander, Dr. Wayne Dyer, L. Ron Hubbard, haven't said anything new since they discovered their formula for success. I went to Richard Bach's webpage long ago and it was talking about his new book in the same sentences he was talking about the need to rebuild his house. Fuck you people. You sold your souls to the man and have become parrots, mimicing your betters, the person you used to be.  And Tammy ... Dr. Wayne Dyer, was Terry's mentor. Becareful who's path you follow. I think you had it more right sitting in the woods with an alter of twings and tin foil and your own vision of God. I think you need to get back what you had, not discover where to go from here.  wicca should always be given freely if it is to be given at all.	12:52 pm I was reading a book I bought about wicca (now this is sort of a contridiction) but one piece of advice that I thought was very sound was if any wiccan offers to teach you to become a witch and charges you a fee it is a scam. ( a fee beyond supplies I mean ..and supplies you buy yourself, not through them)  wicca should always be given freely if it is to be given at all.  wicca=knowlege  but see, we are in the information age! if you have information surely you can find some sucker that will pay you to know it. We are a nation of have to be salesmen. And we either have to sell ourselves or we have to find someone else to sell. Your soul is up for auction to the highest bidder from the moment you are born.  Each child born today has $18,000 in federal debt	01:22 pm If you don't think your soul is for sale to the highest bidder from the moment you are born think on this:  Each child born today has $18,000 in federal debt. And this was in 1996! I can't find the recent one.  Now ... do you think you make out a check each month to the federal government when you get a job to pay this? No way! They do that for you. They take it out in taxes. But the debt still goes up! They are eating you to pay for the debt you owe AND make even more debts owed that you and your children have to pay. Whatcha going to do? You got to eat. Someone has to pay for you if you don't

      If you are spending too much time on the internet and are concerned that it is affecting your concentration, you are not alone.  The addictive nature of web browsing can leave you with an attention span of nine seconds - the same as a goldfish.  "Our attention span gets affected by the way we do things," says Ted Selker, an expert in the online equivalent of body language at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US.  "If we spend our time flitting from one thing to another on the web, we can get into a habit of not concentrating," he told the BBC programme Go Digital.  uickly Bored  With literally millions of websites at our fingertips, the attention span of the average web surfer is measured in seconds.  "When I'm on the internet, my attention span is shorter for each thing because there are so many things to choose from," said one American web browser.  "So instead of focusing on one thing and getting the most out of it, I find myself getting bored quickly because I know there are so many more things out there to go to."  It seems that web surfers show a maddening unwillingness to stay put on any one website.  Sticky Sites  Ever on the lookout for engaging content, most online viewers spend less than 60 seconds at an average site. This is a challenge to commercial websites which are desperate to attract readers and keep them there.  "People talk about this in terms of stickiness," explains psychiatrist Pam Briggs, of Nottingham University in the UK.  "If a website has stickiness, it will keep your attention glued to that site rather than let you click on another one as your competitor is just one click away."  Other digital distractions, like e-mail or instant messaging, are also vying for our attention.  "E-mails are very seductive," says Pam Briggs. "You can't leave them alone when your computer beeps to tell you have a new message, even though you are working on quite an important task."  Stay Focused  And if all this was not enough, quickie movie breaks are a growing distraction. On Shortspan.com, the shortest film is 12 seconds long, while the longest is three and a half minutes. Shortspan.com's founder, Beth Hall, has seen the popularity of these shorts skyrocket over the past 10 years.  "Primarily our audience is folks that already knew about Shortspan or are interested in movies and search for the word on the web. We also get lots of folks on their coffee break at work."  If you find you are spending all night on the web, unaware of time melting away, experts have some advice for you.  "Give yourself a question, give yourself a goal, write it down. Follow that goal, know why you're surfing," says Ted Selker.  "Because if you don't know why you are doing it, you are going to be pushed around by the most exciting words in a never ending sea of information."  Thanks to BBC News

      Ok, this is going to sound a little strange. But for those of you who follow eastern religions it may be of interest.  The yin/yang symbol is made up of the white top teardrop, which is the male aspect, and the bottom dark teardrop which is the female aspect. Within each of the teardrops is a circle the colour of the other teardrop.    The simplistic explination is thus:  The summer solstice (male aspect) begins at the top marked by the small dark circle and winter solstice the white circle on the bottom. Man can never mix into woman and woman cannot mix into man. Black and white.  Unfortunately the seasons are a lot like life, they have a lot of grey areas to prove you can mix the two.  But, I have always thought of it this way. There is a little bit of man in woman and a little bit of woman in man. Otherwise we would not be able to comprehend or recognize each other as friend and not foe at all. Now here is the weird part....  If you look at a womans clitoris it is sheathed by a tiny hood. If you pull back that hood and look at it from the top, it looks exactly like a tiny penis. And if you look at an uncircumsize penis (the way it was intended) from the top, it looks like a rose bud before blooming. A tiny part of man can be found in woman and a tiny part of woman can be found in man! Physical evidence of the yin/yang.  Anyway, this was one of the revelations I found in a pipe dream =]

      It is also true that we are not always what we believe we are. That we believe we are going to die, but live. We believe we are going to fail, but make it through. Sort of suggests that maybe our life isn't as in our hands as I would truly like to believe it is.

      If the world stopped spinning, what WOULD happen to us? Would we be crushed? Would we fly off the face of it into space?  I believe I can fly..... ohh...ahhh...acckkk... splat!	03:16 pm So much of what we are day to day depends on what we believe are. Like, sometimes right when I wake up and right before I open my eyes I am totally what I want to be. But then I start taking stock. It is not something I do on pupose, more probably something that happens as I become more conscious.  I become aware of how fat I am I become aware of how much work I have to do to be the artist I want to be I become aware of how much I don't want to get up.

      I just saw a nun cut someone off in traffic.  Dragon says it could have been a bank robber, or I say then it could have been a hooker or a stripper. I really hope so. I would like the think that nuns hold the last regimin against evil and they uphold what is good and right. But if that was a nun then I dunno. I am thinking now there is no hope in a nun will cut someone off in traffic. I mean now I am thinking if I decided to be come a nun and an old nun in a convent offered to go down on me I think I would lose it and run like hell.  (Dragon says, "Yeah, and then you will be cutting people off in traffic!")

      Do you think some music was written to be listened to stoned? Meaning do you think some music was written with stoners in mind?  I was listening to the Matix soundtrack last night while bringing in the new year and I completely understood the music.  Sometimes I think being stoned is as close to Grokking as humans can acheive in this point in our evolution.

      I believe we all are far too great a victim to the patterns we create in our lives. We create our patterns I think because we are creatures of habit and we need structure and habit in our lives to function in today's society.  Anyway, I hear people talk about their lives and the things they want to do with it and the problems they are having with it and I am forced to think about a behavior I heard from the old bf.        Take a look at your possessions. And for each thing ask yourself. Have you used this in the last 6 months? Are you going to use it in the next 6 months? If not, throw it out.   Now I realize this is drastic behavior and in no way can apply to everything in your life. In fact in a way it seems to be counter-productive to getting anywhere in life. Our things are a conglomeration of our accomplishments in life in a way.  But there is one possession where this philosophy seems to be a good thing. And that is the problems we possess. If you have "used" a problem in your life within the last 6 months and plan on using it again and again in the next 6 months you have possessed that problem for a year. People tend to come to me with their problems and I listen to them over and over, and unfortunately (for both them and me) usually it is also over and over and over, etc., etc., etc. Now what is wrong with this picture?  Well I think if you are still holding on to a problem from the last 6 months and it is not solved by now, you have the next 6 months of your life to either work on it, solve it, or shut up about it. Its a pretty simple thing really. I like things simple. If you have this on going problem and you are talking to your friends about it a year from now and you are not working on it do NOT blame the person that is involved in this problem unless that person is YOU.  Here's the thing. I am probably being judgmental in thinking this. There are a lot of people out there with problems that they just cannot solve. They are not capable for whatever reason (mentally, financially, etc.) But I think this works for most problems people have in their lives. Most of them are at least workable if not, for the most part, completely solvable.  Here's another thing. If you think I am specifically talking about you then I am probably not. If you know I am talking about you I probably am, because I have said similar things to your face before. However it's a thought for everybody.

      I have never understood why people take so much offence to controversial subjects.  If no one ever said anything contrary to my own thoughts then I would never grow. But we strive to keep things "above board". (What is this board anyway? and how is it set?) When I was growing up my parents told me never to talk politics or religion with anyone. These were personal subjects. What they were trying to tell me is these subjects will cause fighting and contention.  People run from contention it is a bad thing they are told. If someone is contending you then bad things happen. ? huh ? I don't get it. That is saying. I don't want to hear anything that doesn't correspond with what I do or would believe. (Because sometimes we hear things that we don't believe but in hearing them decide we DO believe them because they fit us) But how did you know? And what if you are bloody well "wrong" about what you believe and you hear something different and decide it fitted you MUCH better than the "truth" you believed before. Wouldn't you be grateful to know? Or how about if you were "right" and you heard a "wrong" "truth". Now you can look at that and say, "Boy and I glad I believe the way I do, because that is drivel.  I think we should be grateful for contention. It helps us define who we are. Course if you don't want to know who you are, you are running away anyway and I just wasted my breath. =]

      There are so many misunderstandings that people take for granted.  "Majority rules" being one of them.  People hear that and they lay down their arms, their brains, and their dictionaries and assume it means "Majority is right" or "Majority is law".  When I was 17 I made some decisions that caused a good handful of people a great deal of pain. But just because something causes pain does that mean that it is wrong? I left home at 17, choosing to live on the streets. It was a better thing for me to do than to live with a drunk of a father that beat my mother and caused chaos in the house at every turn. I figured if I had survived the chaos of my father for years and years, then I could survive living on the streets. I was right. For the next year or so I lived anywhere I could lay my head.... and people freaked.  They freaked while knowing of survival shows where grown men braved the elements for months and months .... But one 17 year old girl sleeping on the streets scared them to death. I was not old enough, I was not capable. They were wrong. My mother was the one not capable.... she doesn't think she can survive without my father and still doesn't. I on the other hand raised 2 incredible young women, one of which I slept in a car with. I have NEVER seen them as anything else but whole people, human beings, strong and capable. And because of it my kids and I are CLOSE. We are not as close as we used to be because of someone I allowed in my life that I needed to heal from.... but still today we are closer than most people are and we are at our worse. My kids make GOOD decisions.... and not always the easier ones ... not always the ones that cause no one any pain. They chose what they feel is right. And sometimes if I sit down and think about it I end up realizing that too. There have been times my "children" were right when I was wrong, and I tell them that. My "kids" are 15 and 13.  My convictions and my judgments have not gotten better since I was 17. In fact they have gotten worse. I now base my decisions on fear and the fear of pain. I don't necessarily act on what is right anymore. I am getting old and worn down. Because so many other people chose what it easy instead of what is right.  "Kids" are growing up even faster these days. My oldest daughter practically runs her own household downstairs and she is 15. We did this to our kids people. Because while we were working on achieving the American dream we gave them time to think. And they did, and they grew. And they remembered ... that is wasn't so long ago in our evolution where "girls" that started to bleed were married because they were women, and they were ready to take the role they had been trained all their lives to take.  Wake UP people and lay aside your fears and judgments that aren't really yours. Your "children" are human beings, and they are changing the world at a faster rate than YOU are. Most of what you do today will just be come home from work and not die!

      Wouldn't the things that determine how "manly" you are actually be determined by the size of your balls? Or more accurately the testosterone production of said testicles? AND wouldn't what things that should be liked by someone "mainly" be determined by culture and not hormones?  Take for instance the difference between Italian and British cultures. The Italians are stereotyped as very expressive men ... The more you display your emotions (usually in a macho kind of way) the more manly you are... but in Britain you are manly if you can control those emotions instead of letting them control you.  I am saying it this way (linking manly to penis size/testicle/testosterone production) because most of the questions asked are about what things you enjoy doing and how you respond to the society you are in....  Technically that makes me a "bigger man" than most.... I scored 7 inches =]  NOW ... lemme give you the tune from Cluey You-us to the News-us. It doesn't matter how long you are .... and it really doesn't matter how thick girthed you are ... you are NOT going to make a woman have an orgasm by vaginal penetration.  AND for you ladies lemme clue you in too. The longer the penis the greater chance of "premature ejaculation". This is a plain physiological fact. And as proof I offer this ...  Ever wonder why horses schlongs are so long? What do animals that have "no true sense of sexual pleasure" (i.e. they do not have sex for pleasure) need with a penis that large? Quite simply they need it for quick ejaculation. The greater surface area allows the stallion to penetrate and attempt to impregnate in just around 6 to 30 seconds (although 30 is stretching it) It seems that the greater surface area supplies more stimulation (more skin is getting stimulated at once) causing quick ejaculation which is needed to ensure they are not left vulnerable too long and be attacked by predators.  It would appear that nature has given them the tool they needed to insure survival eh?

      I think it is man's fate from God as reward or punishment to forever ponder his meaning in life. He questions his place, where he belongs in the grand scheme of things. And he questions who he is.  And many times in this asking of what stuff he is made he will dare to dream about what he should be, what he wants to be. But mostly it becomes what he will never be. Sadly, for reasons that are perceived as beyond our control, most of us fall short of what we want to accomplish. We have many tragic reasons, the kids the job our surroundings the lack of a silver spoon, and even some of the utensils we freely use on ourselves, bad decisions made at crucial moments, the wrong turn at an innocent fork.  But what if I told you that the blame was ok to take one step further? And that you could accept responsibility for the whole 10 course meal that is your life and still not puke over the thought and shame. What if I said that you not only are what you eat but you are also how you eat it!  See the question of who we are is a very simple one as long as you do not try to look at a complex being as a sculpture made of stone. Rather look at is as one made of clay, constantly being molded from one shape to another by the decisions and whims of the artist. And by these decisions you become who you are today. You, as well as your fate, were written page by page letter by letter to make you who you are at any given time in your development. Written just as books you were. And just like any book you can look at it in its entirety, hold it in your hands, feel it and even taste it if you want to. You can see it is a whole book held right there in your hand as plain as day .... but you will never understand it unless you read it. You will never be able to tell what it is about unless you look inside! Page by page, word by word, you understand it just like it was written. You can see how patterns developed and how nations were made, a huge nation of a person build brick by brick, stone by stone by the decisions they make every day. Because that is who we are! We are what we chose to do and how we chose to act every day of our lives. Read your book, this is you! Se there ... that decision you made to cheat on your wife, that is you. The decision you made to not pay back that credit card because the company was unjust is you too. The decision you made to turn your back on that guy in the alley getting mugged. When you chose to do this or that or to move left instead of right or to go forward or retreat. They all are who you are. It was a question very simply answered wasn't it?  Now the tough question is do you like you? Is this the you you dreamed and wanted to be? If so that may be great! If you are an ax murderer or a politician you might want to read on however.  If who we are is made up of what we do every day then who we are becoming is a matter of how you chose to act and react. Will you act galantly when the boss fires you from your job when you just bought that expensive house in the Villiage? Go home and tell your wife but tell her that everything is going to be ok because what you are left with is what is real. Her and the kids and the knowlege you have in your head that knows you are going to pull it out of the hat as long as you stick together? When your tired as hell and your daughter spills juice all over the clean laundry you had just folded do you yell at her and flay her ass and not see her for the rest of the day. Does this happen over and over again until you don't really see her for the rest of your lives? Because didy ou know all that time she was hiding under the porch outside crying alone in the dark thinking that crying alone is all she will ever find from humanity? Decisions like these are made all the time and they are so eailsy done. Too easily. Moment by moment we chose who we are. but most of the time we are so quip about it. The decision of what to do flies out of us before we ever bother to think about how it makes us look. And how it makes us. Man is shaped by his actions as surely as his actions held a knife and his body were made of clay. And with every single action we define ourselves. Many people have an idea of who they are. they say the are noble, they say they are strong. The will claim to sensitivity or to intellegence. And they very well may be. But only if they claim to footwork as well. If you want to know where you are going look where you have gone. Because chances are until you see the pattern of your behaviors the next step you make will be made as easily as the one before it, by rote as patterns are usually made.  And do you want that choice to be made so easily? I mean what if your path is like a plate set before a banquet? But this banquet holds very strange wares. Cake and cream and juicy roast beef and broccoli with cheese sauce.... and plates of mangled slug bodies and dead puppy parts and week old fish heads ... and shit. Now as it is your habit to just blindly scoop up whatever is put before you and shovel it in your mouth, claiming it sight unseen, chances are you are going to eat some gross stuff! Not to mention it's probably very bad for you. Is this sounding like your life? Then why are you eating blindly and THEN acting accordingly?  You are what you do every day!! You are what you do every day!! You are what you do every day!! You are what you eat from your head down to your feet. Life is your dinner table, and we can chose what we eat and how. Even when the choices seem so limited, make them yours. We can sit and eat it with dignity, or we can rip at the table cloth in protest. Either way is valid, but make SURE of your decision. Because your dreams are becoming true, you are becoming what you should be. Life is like a book with all the pages blank in between, you are writting the Great American Novel ... and it is you!  I told you the blame was not so hard to palate. Bona petite!

      funny though ... Jesus summed up the whole Word in two things.  Love God Love each other  yet Jesus weeps?  wonder why?  What did you do today to make the world easier for one other person?  When you offer your hand did your feet follow? or your mouth?  Today I laid on bed with a belly ache and did nothing. I ate too much last night when I got stoned. I should appologize to whomever I failed today. But Jesus will still weep.

       Touching for visual reference is a visual tool for artists that involves learning textures through touch so they can be recreated later at the canvas.
