      I hate the rain, I only like it when im at work, it stops the customers from coming to shop so I don't have to do shit.  But anyway today was interesting because I chilled with my friend Ian Horrocks.  We wanted to go to meijers to buy BB's for our AirSoft Guns so we could shoot shit.  Well that didn't happen because we didn't know how to get there.  We ended up getting lost, so we went back to his house and attacked his freezer and ate some Pizzas.  Then we called up Ian's friend Kevin aka "The Gish" you cant stand to be around him for long periods of time, because he whines about everything. So we got him to take us to meijer and we bought the BB's. When we got back to Kevin's house we shot at squirrels and each other. When Kevin got shot in the face we never heard the end of it. But today turned out to be an ok day.

      Well this is what allways happens when I try to keep a journal thingy. but anyways where I left off. That bike was way too small so I didnt get it.  But I got an ok moped instead. Its fast, for a moped somewhere arround 47-50 mph tops, it will go faster when im done with it.  Im off work now untill school starts, so i dont gotta get up early for about 13 days then school starts and i gotta get up at like 625, thats gonna suck. Ill post more later, but fornow just look for the cool guy on a blue moped on a street near you.

      Finaly I get a day off work.  Lastnight was so slow at work, we had 5 people shoping there, but it was ok because we closed an hour early at 8.  When I got home I went to my computer and went looking for this sweet bike I saw at Meijer last week,  urlLink here it is , the only problem is that it comes in 20" and 16" sizes, I hope im not to big. But it gets even tighter because im gonna add a motor to it because im lazy,  urlLink click here for example , so if im not to big im gonna get it because its gonna be the closest thing to a motorcycle im gonna get while living here with my parents.  But anyways I gotta read my swell book 1984 today so my mom will get off my case, then I can go and have some fun.

      Wow I haven't done one of there in years. Well I think im gonna do one now because my friend joes is so cool. Well anyways today I went to work at Oakland Nurseries from 8 till 4 it sucked it was all hot and people were being rude. The only good thing that happened today at work was I saw my old friend josh from middle school. When I got home I took a shower and went to my bud Ian Horrocks' house we sat around and shot stuff with our air soft guns. Then I got home from there at 10:30 and ate some food. Then I watched some lame ass show on tv and came up to my room and made this lil thingy. yep so today turned out to be ok.
