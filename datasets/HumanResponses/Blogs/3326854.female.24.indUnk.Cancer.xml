      Ok, so it's been a while, boo hoo.  I'm down now to 166-165, and yesterday I got a shitload of pills, and I mean a shitload.  I've got 9 different things to take (not including my body mint), and some of them I have to take 2 pills.  Good lord.  The Pyruviate pills horrify me.  They are the larges pills I have ever seen in my entire life.  I have to get a pill splitter.  So I'm taking like apple cider, cayenne, chitosan, DHEA, psylum husks, relora, L-carnitine, and pyruviate and a one other thing I can't think of right now.  Hopefully I won't die from taking all these at once, my sincere hope is that I start losing weight!  Yay!  Wishfull thinking....of course I'm looking for the magic bullet that lets me eat what I want and not exercise and be thin and hot.  Don't act like you don't want the same thing.  It's not totally laziness, because I will continue to work out as well, and I'm not eating cartons of ice cream or anything.  About working out, I totally punked out last week.  It was so freaking hot I didn't leave the house once all weekend.  I sat with the a/c cranked trying not to die.  Ok, I'm tired, I think I'm gonna read for a bit, then get a pill splitter and organizer and some lip gloss and lunch, sounds fun eh?  I got my miracle cloth too, it's pretty awesome, does about what it says, I'm relatively impressed, my bare minerals havent shown yet, but my skin is looking rather nice and feeling pretty soft from my Proactiv now, I'm glad, I was getting impatient.  So now all I need is for my pills to work wonders.  My carpet is also lovely because I got a bissel carpet cleaner.  Worth every penny.

      Yay!  165.8  I was getting worried.  Hopefully this will prove to be a downward trend and not a weekly fluctuation.  I was very good as far as eating healthy went yesterday.  The only cheat thing was a small bite of Steve's Klondike bar. So here's yesterday's rundown:  B: Special K & banana  S: Orange  L: 6" tuna on honey oat & raspberry iced tea (out of diet pepsi)  S: Special K & banana  D: 1 chicken breast w/ leftover pasta from previous night  Cheat: Tiny (I promise) bit of Klondike bar, 1 popsicle  I didn't work out yesterday.  My elbow was really stiff and sore, and I was just kind of tired all over.  Bad excuse, I know.  I know I feel soooo good after 30-60 mins on the treadmill.  Well, I'm definitely getting my ass down there tonight.

      Hey!!!  What the fuck?  I'm up to 168 this morning.....though I weighed myself after I had Special K and a banana for breakfast.  My trainer set out a 1300-something calorie a day plan, and I started it yesterday.  It went fine, with breakfast and snack, then I had Quiznos for lunch, which in itself is decent, but I waited in line so damn long that I grabbed a bag of Doritos and a water.  Then Cyndi called wanting a damn cookie....why the hell did I need to get myself one?  I didn't finish it, but I'm sure I had enough to matter.  Dinner was some in-a-bag alfredo stuff, which was decent tasting, not fabulous or anything, but I didn't check the calories.  It's going to be hard to check calories after a year of completely disregarding them.  So today I'm off to a fresh start.  I sincerely hope the gain was due to the bad things I ate, and not the fact that I am starting to eat carbs again.    I ordered all my supplements, so I'm gonna be taking like 100 pills a day.  I hope nothing is going to kill me by mixing them.  I am gonna have a tuna sandwich from Subway today.  No ifs, ands or buts about it.  Then for dinner, maybe a steak or some chicken.  Ooh!  It's almost time to eat my orange!  I can't believe how much I missed fruit.  I never ate it, but I missed it when I couldn't have it.  I have nothing to do today.  I'm soooooo bored at work!!  Anyways, I'm getting tired of talking to you, so bye.

      Ok, so I forgot to post this weekend, I thought about it, but I just didn't feel like it.  All in all I was fairly good as far as eating went.    Saturday:  2 Nutrigrain bars           1 sour apple w/sugar and cinnamon           2 parmesan chicken           1 chicken burrito  Sunday:  2 slices french toast         2 oranges         1 popsicle         2 bud lights         4 graham crackers         1 ton kal-bi         1 haagen-das bar  I didn't work out on Saturday, the weather was AWFUL.  It rained all day and it felt like I was wrapped in a hot wet blanket.  I didn't leave the house, just once to get the mail.  Ugh.  They're closed on Sunday, so I'll have to make it up today.  I was excited cuz I thought I lost 4 lbs, but as of today it was only 2 (stupid haagen-das).  Steven doesn't love me.  He wants to leave.  He is either going on his own, or he wants to marry me and move immediately.  With no thought of my life here.  This is all I've ever known.  I've never gone more than 2 weeks without seeing my parents.  His life has always been one of moving every few years.  That's not for me.  Maybe we aren't meant to be together...It's like we're counting the days until he leaves (even though he hasn't set a date or anything).  We're so rotten to eachother.  He's cold and uncaring and loveless, and I'm pushy and naggy and bitchy.  I try to draw him close, and he rebuffs me.  It hurts and I get biter an angry, then we don't speak.  I hate this already.  I want to be young and in love and enjoy life.  I don't want to always be angry.  I try to start fresh every time I see him with a smile and love, but he always manages to kill that.  Oh well, all I can do is hope and pray and continue to try to explain to him until I'm blue in the face.  Maybe he'll be gone before then.....

      I just finished a GIGANTIC gyro and a side of seasoned fries with a diet Pepsi...good thinking, have a diet soda.  I don't know what the hell is wrong with me.  I look in the mirror, I'm not happy with what I see.  I get on the scale, I'm angry at what I've done to all my progress, and I'm horrified to see it creeping up to 175 again.  This is scary.  Why do I continue to find the worst things in the world to eat and eat them?  It's like I've been on a 6 month binge-fest and I don't hold back on anything.  Was I that deprived that now I can't find the willpower to choose a salad, or at least forgo the fries?  I have to get to the bottom of my eating habits.  This has to change.  I have to find the same resolve I found last April and lost 23lbs. following Atkins.  Where is this resolve?  I've tried to talk to myself, crying in the mirror, but still I do this to myself.  It's not that I really believe that if I exercise a little bit that I can burn it all off.  It's like when it comes to eating, I want what I want when I want it.  Then I have to suffer the consequenses.  I don't need a food diary to show me how much garbage I eat.  I already know.  But hopefully blogging will help me to understand the emotions and destructive behavior to try to change them.  My god, I know the willpower is in me, I got down to 148 around August of 2003.  I was never happier!  Then I used the lame ass excuse when the holidays rolled around.  I've just never been able to fully get back on the wagon since then.  I know I have it in me, I just need to find what sparked the drive in me again.  I want this.  I want to be a thin, healthy, energetic, self-confident, sexy, strong, beautiful 24 year old.  I don't want to go straight from fat to pregnant to old.  I want to experience the sexy young body.  Dammit, I deserve it.  I have to do this right.  I want to do this right.  God help me, I just need to use my common sense instead of my impulses when I eat.  I can do this.  Pray for me.

      Good God.  What the hell is wrong with me?  I was late for an appointment so I didn't have time to stop at Jamba Juice or Jack in the Box for breakfast.  When I got back to the trailer there were 2 boxes of donuts for the meeting.  I held out for about 30 mins.  Then I had one.  Then another.  When everyone was gone I had a couple more.  I think I had 5 in total.  Talk about binge.  Too bad I can't purge.  They were crappy donuts too!  I vowed that would be all I ate.  Yeah right.  Keala offered me some fries, I had some.  I got home and had 2 popsicles, and italian chicken with pasta.  Probably gonna have another couple of popsicles tonight too.    I was going to work out, but I was so tired from Steve staying up so late and constantly disrupting my sleep cycle, that I came home early and crashed.  Then I couldn't find the drive to get to the gym.  I will definitely go tomorrow.  And Saturday.  That will mean that I got in 3 workouts this week, which is quite respectable.  I will try to make posts on a meal by meal basis from now on to accuarately detail my menus.  It's easier to get an idea of what I'm stuffing into my face if it's just a simple list.   Off topic, my monitor has a line running down the side, I'm frustrated, and it's hot as hell in this damn office.  I will buy an a/c tomorrow.

      Ok, for anyone who might stumble accross this blog for whatever reason, I want it to be known that I fully support my President, my troops, and my war on terror.  We were right to invade Afghanistan.  We were right to invade Iraq.  The few who tortured Iraqi POWs were WRONG and STUPID.  The baddies beheaded an American citizen in retaliation of our mistreatment of Iraqis.....what the fuck!?  Bomb their fucking asses!  I am sick and tired of all these fucking Dems going around and doing, well, doing what Dems do best....bitch.    FYI, pre 9/11, I was a tree-hugging, soldier-hating, make-love-not-war, shit-for-brains, hippie, liberal Democrat.  Then 2 planes flew into 2 towers of the World Trade Center and I watched (just like all you did) as one tower fell....then the other tower fell.  Oh my fucking God, this isn't happening, this is a dream, this is a movie, this ISN'T real.........yes, it is.  There are those who say we brought this upon ourselves.  Bullshit.  Go to hell.  No country brings something like this upon themselves.    My life has been forever changed.  I was 21 when the towers fell and 3,000+ people were murdered by a crazy man and his gang.    It was like I woke up from a haze.  A Democratic brainwashed haze.  I saw the world for what it was.  I saw myself for who I was.  I'm an American.    Did you know that Osama Bin Laden tried to blow up the WTC prior to this?  What the fuck!?  Why didn't anyone tell me this shit??  Why didn't I notice?  I was old enough to take notice.  What did we do in retaliation?  Chuck a couple of bombs at them.  Losers.  Stupid ass Clinton.  I can't believe I was brainwashed into voting for him.  Did you see that movie Black Hawk Down?  Did you know that was all REAL?  I knew it was real when I went to see it with my boyfriend, Steve (who btw has helped in my conservative, republican education).  That movie freaked me out.  That movie infuriated me.  Did you know that news stations broadcast images of our dead soldiers being dragged through the streets?  WHY THE HELL DON'T I REMEMBER THIS??  Oh yeah, cuz we were all too damn busy learning about Clinton's blowjobs.  Damn him.    Did we do anything in retaliation?  I have no clue.  How about the attacks on our Embassies?  That's an attack on American soil and an act of war.  The USS Cole?    Yeah, I guess we did bring these attacks upon ourselves.  The terrorists hit us time and time again, and they got away with it like a naughty child.  America was the laughingstock of the world when Clinton was in office.  We were weak when we should have been strong.  Now Bush is our leader and he has to clean up the mess Clinton made.  When Reagan was being sworn into office, Libya released their American hostages.  After he demanded that the Berlin Wall be torn down, it was.  Why?  Cuz the world was scared shitless of this man because he was a badass.  He built up our forces and you knew that he would use them.  Whew.  What a rant.  Anyways, I can't understand why the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners is still taking precidence over the beheading of Michael Berg.  The media is way too liberal and this makes it so the much more obvious that their purpose is to make the war look bad and to get rid of Bush.  This is why I watch Fox news.  Liberals think its Conservative news, they just don't understand fair and balanced when they see it.  They are so used to being force-fed what the liberals want them to see.  I'm shutting up now.  I had a twisty donut, I will probably have several more.  My legs are still stiff, but I think they are well enough to get me to they gym today.  I'm glad, I want to get the most out of my membership as possible.

      Ew, so this is the first season I've ever bothered to watch AI.  It's nice cuz I have a DVR, so I can record it and fast forward through all the boring Seacrest moments and 8,000,000,000 commercials.  But tonight, I cheated and checked online to see who had been voted off.  I'm soooooo horrified right now.    My alarm clock goes off at 6:00am with a local radio station, and the instant it went on it was Jasmine Trias "singing" (those are sarcastic air quotes) 2 horrible disco songs.  After hearing that, and that Simon made her cry, I couldn't wait to see the performance and results show.  I am so ashamed of my state right now, let me send out a heartfelt apology from Hawaii for keeping Jasmine in this so long.  Yeah, it was nice to have her stay, but for her to stay and one of the 2 best singers to leave....egad.    Jasmine has not sung well once in this competition.  I will just have to console myself with the fact that LaToya will certainly be scooped up by a recording company and have millions of dollars tossed at her for the rest of her life.  I promise that we are not tone deaf in Hawaii.  It's all about local pride and sticking up for your peeps, but I admit this has gotten entirely out of hand.  To all you AI fans out there...I'M SORRY!

      So this is it, my very first blog....I have begun.  I've actually decided this blog as a 2-parter after reading a couple of mags.  I'm sure no one will read, as this is super generic and probably utterly boring (myself included).  It's just a means to get my feelings and thoughts as well as my weight-loss progress on "paper".  It's Wednesday 5/12/04, and my legs are still EXTREMELY sore from my trainer workout on Monday.  Larry is evil.  I want to kill him.  I had just gotten into the "feel good" of going into the gym and working out (i.e. treadmill) when he has to go and incapacitate me for 2 days.  I have to do this 2 more times with him.  I have to get him to tone it down, because as it is, I can barely stand up and sit down I'm so damn sore.  I think this is it for today.  I am still contemplating whether or not I should try to stretch my muscles on the treadmill and get in a workout.    Toodles.

      "LOVE is not about sex. LOVE is not about forbidden fantasies. LOVE is all about the passion created through a lifetime of commitment at all cost to the relationship and to serving each other."  This came from: http://smalley.gospelcom.net/artman/publish/article_322.shtml  Steven tells me there is passion and lust missing from our relationship.  He rejects me then looks at porn.  I don't know if I can do this.  I know it's his problem, but I can't help but feel there is something wrong with ME, that he could do this to me.  How hateful and hurtful.  I'm trying, but I'm scared I'm setting myself up or wasting my time.  What if I work so hard and he DOESN'T change?  You can't change someone anyway.  What if he ends of leaving, and it was all for nothing.  Just more pain and hurt.  Porn isn't a deal breaker for me, but rejection of me and THEN porn might be.  I'm not sure.  I hurt inside.  I feel how I felt the last time I discovered his porn.  I don't know if I want to keep doing this.  I don't know what to do.  I need help.

      I don't know what to do.  How can I be with a man who pulls away from every kiss and touch, squeals at every attempt to seduce, and rebuffs every plea to make love?  Did he do this with his other girlfriends, or just me?  Do I disgust him?  Does he really NOT love me?  Has he just been keeping me around because he can't afford it here without me, because it's easier?  It's always been about him.  On his terms.  All the time.  I hate this.  I hate what this has done to me.  When we met, I had gotten out of 2 relationships in a matter of months, and I had grown strong and confident.  I felt hot.  I felt wanted.  I was the user, if a man didn't want to be with me, I wasn't gonna give a flying fuck.  I didn't wait by the phone.  He called he called, he didn't, I moved on.  Now I'm pathetic.  I don't have faith in my sexuality.  I see the rolls, and the pimples, and I think, "No wonder he pushes me aside, I wouldn't want to fuck me either".    The funny thing is, I think I'm better looking now than then.  Though I am a bit heavier, as of today I am really going to strive to whittle down until I'm comfortable in my own skin.  He has slaughtered my ego.  I don't think it was purposeful or malicious, I just think that's the way he is.  It's all about him.    He doesn't meet my needs.  He doesn't even try.  Does he know what my needs are?  They are simple, as are most people.    I need to feel loved. I need to feel beautiful. I need to feel sexy. I need to feel affection. I need to feel empathy. I need to be kissed. I need to be held. I need to feel desired. I need to feel needed. I need to feel like I am the only woman he wants in this whole world, that I am meant to be with him. I need to feel cared for.  If he cannot supply me my needs, than I have no other choice, for the sake of my emotional health, but to leave him.  I have loved him for so long.  I have given him all that I had wanted from him in return.  I have tried to explain what I needed.  I have tried to show by example what I needed.  I need to feel strong and confident again.  I can't be with a man who pulls away from a tender kiss to his neck, an attempt to breathe warmly on his throat, kissing, sucking, licking gently, to arouse and excite him.  This is constant.  This has absolutely devastated my womanhood.  How can I feel like a beautiful woman, when the man who claims to love me does not?  This is so unhealthy.  I feel ill.  What I do now, I do for me.  I see a pretty girl looking at me in the mirror.  But she is unhappy.  Even through her smile, you can see the pain a uncertainty in her eyes.  "Are you sure you're pretty, or are you just saying that?"  I can't even trust my own thoughts.  I don't care if my birthday is on Sunday.  If I have to answer to everyone I know, this is it.  This man has hurt me too many times to count.  If he truly loves me, he will either love me as a man should love a woman, or let me go to know happiness with another.

      ....and you can too!  I'm a girl BTW.    Here's the  urlLink link   I had a beer/doritos/popcorn bingefest with girlfriends from work last night, and I'm up to 167.  Bah.  My fault.  I'm gonna have a cheeseburger for lunch, then I really want to stay true to Atkins/Herbalife HPLC.  I see success stories on Atkins, and I just know that I can do that too.  Today, however, I shall enjoy my cheeseburger and fries.  Gotta pee now.  Hasta.

      166?? I cried this morning.  I was doing so well.  Last night I weighed myself and I was 165.6 or something.  That told me that I was going to be lighter this morning, cuz I always weigh less in the morning.  I cried.  This isn't fair.  I had some taco shells.  How could that be what made me GAIN weight?  Life isn't fair to me.  Why won't it let me be thin and beautiful??  So it's bullshit.  I won't buy it.  I don't weigh 166, fuck the fucking scale.  FUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKK

      Weight: 165.6 Body Fat: 38%  Total loss: 2.2lbs  Yay!!!!  I'll be really really excited when I drop down into the 150s.  This is still a regular flux for me.  Down to the 150s will assure me that this is actually working, but I can't help but be happy that it's gotten me this far.  It's fairly easy too, because when I get hungry, I can totaly supplement it with protein.  It's basically Atkins again, but with shakes and pills.  The shakes are kind of nice, because I think they are giving me the sweetness and chocolate that I tend to crave.  That last time I did Herbalife, I wasn't allowed to eat with the shakes and between the shakes, and that SUCKED.  But now, I can have my shake and some chicken nuggets with it.  I'm satisfied, and I feel that I'm doing well.    If this truly works, and it continues on its current course I could potentially lose 36 lbs by the Annual Picnic.  Don't think that will happen, but what a nice thought.

      I fucking hate this job sometimes. I get ragged on for putting something on a punchlist, then I get ragged on for NOT putting something on a punchlist and asking them to do it.  I can't fucking win.  I'm tired of this shit.  And then Steve.  He can't stand me asking him to do ANYTHING.  Even when it's not nagging.  When I ask him if he could go to the office to get some paint before they close, and he sighs and says ok (but sounds like I'm imposing the world on him) and then doesn't do it...What the fuck?! If I thought he would help me out around the house AT ALL, then I wouldn't ask him to do little things here or there.  All I asked was if he could mail back his movie, do a load of laundry, MAYBE some dishes.  God, why do I have to do EVERYTHING, then get bithced at if I DON'T do something.  Why is it MY FUCKING FAULT if he doesn't have any clean socks?  He knows how to use the damn washing machine.  I do housework on MY day off.    Fine.  Whatever.  He doesn't ever even want to have lunch with me.  I thought about dumping him right there on the phone.  Why be with me if you NEVER want to do anything nice for me, like drop by and take me to lunch when he's doing nothing.  Or do some dishes, or even take out the trash.  I'm in such a pissy mood right now, everyone is on my shit list.  I've got PMS, but the people around me are NOT being cool either.

      I just wrote a very long and beautiful blog about my boyfriend Steve and his poor mood, and the way he loves me when he thinks I'm sleeping, and how I want to cheer him up because I love him so much.  As I was editing it, I was disconnected from our VPN and lost it.  BAAAAAAAAAHHHHH.  Oh well, I guess that's the gist of it.  Toodles.

      Got up at 4:30 am yesterday morning to go fishing with Steve's friend.  He blew us off.  What an ass.  I hope his boat sinks.  I made awesome sandwiches and cookies and took a day off work for this.  So we went back home for a nap and we went fishing ourselves.  I caught a pretty yellow fish that we threw back, and Steve hooked but didn't quite catch a couple of tilapia.  I don't understand how those ugly fish got so smart.  We had a BAD day.    1) got stood up at 5:30 am 2) didn't get going until around 12:30  3) spent $80+ on fishing stuff (actually Steve did) 4) got thrown off our fishing pier (rules changed) 5) lost a piece of a fishing pole into the murky waters 7) felt like a day and $80 was wasted, when I could've gone to work and been taken out on a romantic evening or something.  Oh well.  I also ate a whole bunch of cookies, chips, cheetos, and sandwiches.  My herbalife hasn't shown yet, I'm hoping (not really) it'll come today and I can get thin and gorgeous (yeah right).  I'm tired and hungry, the 2 california rolls I had for lunch we so not satisfying, I think I'm gonna get some donuts.

So last night a girlfriend came over to mom & dad's for dinner, and right off the bat, dad asked her who she is voting for (knowing Laura, I knew her answer wouldn't be a good one) "Kerry" she said, because Bush is pro-life.  Ohmigod. This started a war at the dinner table.  The guests actually had to leave.  But it's amazing, because I used to think like her.  It was strange to see the same defiance and utterly ignorant arguments that I might have made 3 years ago coming from her.  And now I see it from the other side.  Dad and I argued with her (actually, dad got in a tizzy and yelled, I explained and tried to steer her to watch Fox's Hannity & Colmes and O'Reilly and get the FACTS and make her own decisions) for about an hour or two.  All I hope I got across to her was to not just take "what she's heard" as gospel, and to get into the facts and learn.  Making an ignorant vote is worse than not voting if you ask me.  Kerry would destroy this nation.  I know it.  I feel it in my heart.  I was scared when Bush won, I thought all the same things she is thinking now...lose the right to choose, etc.  Now I know that it was all liberal media bullshit that warped my mind.  They tell you what they want you to hear.  Clinton signed a piece of legislation regarding abortion rights.  Every president we've had has been pro-life and against same-sex marriages.  I don't know why she thinks that Bush will be THE ONE who takes her rights away.  He is far too concerned with winning a war than he is on taking away our rights to murder fully-grown fetuses.  Anywho, it amazed me how utterly ignorant she was on world events.  She reminded me too much of me when I was 17, and she's turning 26.  How scary is this, America's youth is turning into America's adults and leaders, yet so many of them still don't take an interest or put a thought into what is REALLY happening....they are still just being spoon-fed by the media.  What a shame.  Onto my herbalife section of this post.....I bought it, again.  I tried it when I was in college, but it was the green plan and it didn't work.  For some reason I think that the gold plan (low-carb) will work because I did so well on low-carb.  Deep down I know this isn't going to work, but for some reason I feel like I'm gonna cry and die if it doesn't.  Why can these diets work wonders for the people who advertise it, but not me?  I don't even care if it doesn't last!  Just to lose all this weight for a while, and I can figure out how to keep it off!  Just pleeeeeaaaase work!  I really want it to, I'm praying with tears in my eyes.  This has to work.  Right?
