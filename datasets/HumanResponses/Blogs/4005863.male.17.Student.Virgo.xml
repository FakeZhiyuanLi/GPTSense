      I finished Memoirs of a Geisha. It was really brilliant and provided a window into the world of the Geisha. I have much respect for them. They are not high paid prostitutes as many people seem to thing. They had honor and respect. I really would love to meet some real Geisha when I go to Japan. Ha, I honestly don't believe I would ever have enough money though. Perhaps one day. Today I haven't done that much. I have just been spending time with my mom and brother. I know my mom and brother are going to miss me a lot when I leave. I know mom wishes I didn't leave the state, but I just know that this is the right path. I mean it was like a sign when I heard of Wittenberg. It was last summer, and I received a pamphlet from them, and they knew about my interest in Japan. I still don't know to this day how they found a guy in a small town in Alabama, because they don't have a single student from Alabama. It has to be destiny. Well that is all for today. Take care everyone and God Bless.

      I have been reading Memoirs of a Geisha almost all day today. It is such a fascinating novel. I never realized how difficult being a geisha is. It also talks about Japan's past. If I could live in any time it would definitely be either before the Meiji era or the early 1900s in Japan that is. I have also been fond of the Wild West era of America. Ha I guess I am just a hero kind of guy. Cowboys and samurais always seemed so cool and brave always saving the damsel in distress and other heroic deeds. Anyway, I am losing track of what I wanted to say. I have gained an even greater respect of the Japanese from this book. They have such a dignified and polite manner. Well, that is about it for today. I suppose it is just too late or something. See you later.

       I always seem to have all these thoughts in my head, and I need to find a way to let them out. I thought a Blog would be the best place to do it. I really don't expect anyone else to read this, but everyone is welcome into my world. The reason I decided to name this page Baka Gaijin (Stupid Foreigner) is that I will be starting college in Ohio next month, and I feel like I will be a stupid foreigner there. I have grown up in Alabama my entire life, but there were no colleges around here that had what I wanted. You see my dream in to live in a peaceful town in Japan with a career that I enjoy and that helps people. I found a college that let's you major in East Asian Studies, and I decided that I wanted to go there. It is a private university though, but somehow I was accepted. I will be able to learn Japanese there, and I can study in Japan my third year. It seems like the best place to begin my quest to achieve my dreams. I just hope that I am smart enough to make it through. My family and friends think so, but I have been having doubts. I also wonder if I will be able to make it in Japan. Not to be stereotyping are anything but the Japanese are in my opinion the most intelligent group of people on the planet. How can I fit in? Well that is a bit lengthy explanation on the Baka Gaijin. I will be posting my thoughts and experiences in a "foreign" land. Take care everyone.
