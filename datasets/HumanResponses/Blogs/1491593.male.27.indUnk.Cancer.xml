      its been a great weekend, met a few friends for some soccer on the beach, had a great breakfast at barrista...always been a coffee shop kind of guy, and after getting some work done during the day......turned up for our alumni party!!  was great fun, celebrated a friends birthday, indulged in a lot of beer, loadsa food, even greater loadsa legg pulling!! it was better for the fact that my closest friends from my batch barring a few , who are located elsewhere; were there.....  but as a friend had told me that morning, some people will come, exchange cards and leave, some will come and have a blast...... thankfully the visiting card crowd left sooner. also met some really sweet super super seniors....they claimed to be ten years our senior , but i wouldnt have put them beyond five... One really important person was missing but ......   anyways, ever notice how a simple conversation with the right person can cheer you up, well, it works for me ... and has taken me so far through this week. Think i need a daily dose!!   just finished Paulo Coelho's  " Valkyirie "  , he is really one of the more powerful writers of our time, highly recommended.

      after a loooong hot and humid summer, the rains have finally arrived, and boy, does it feel good!! add to that long conversations, good music, a sense of calm...... i know what nirvana feels like....   Top Of The World      urlLink The Carpenters     Such a feelin's comin' over me There is wonder in most everything I see Not a cloud in the sky Got the sun in my eyes And I won't be surprised if it's a dream  Everything I want the world to be Is now coming true especially for me And the reason is clear It's because you are here You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen  (*) I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation And the only explanation I can find Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around Your love's put me at the top of the world  Something in the wind has learned my name And it's tellin' me that things are not the same In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me  There is only one wish on my mind When this day is through I hope that I will find That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me All I need will be mine if you are here

      its been some time since i wrote. a couple of sundays have passed, thankfully those sunday mornings passed on the beach with a soccer ball. and last sunday i discovered, or should i say re-discovered that beer on saturday tends to have violent arguments with football on sunday. am better of giving up beer on saturday. but the whole reason for drinking is that you dont get that kind of music and that atmosphere outside a pub...hmmm. one wonders why. also realised the difference between being attracted to someone and being in love with someone. you can definitely feel the difference. went through the diary i keep at work, for pending stuff and appointments, saw the entire this filled with work related stuff and i thought six months of my life have gone by and i dont have anything personal written here. not even a little scribble here and there!! thats why i think this blogging is a great idea.  now i have got writer's block, can't think of the next thing to write......shall wait for the block to dissolve..cheers to me till then!

      thankfully soccer did happen this sunday, and rain also chose the same sunday morning to happen....but thankfully the rain was more of a bully then a threat, just drenched us and then gave up when we refused to leave the field of play.....  and since i was already having a sore throat and a running nose, the rain did not dampen my health at all....  week has been good so far with pleasant conversations and quite evenings with friends who work in liquor companies, such company always keeps my spirits high.....and these evenings are all the better for happening after loooooong work days,  life is good... as long i have friends, and some soccer in my life, i am content.

      another weekend passed without beach soccer, which is bad in itself..what makes it worse is that i was working on sunday too..had to attend some thing called " focus group " to research the probable success of the latest killer app product we are making...suprisingly women were more receptive to the idea, men were luke warm and we were exposing a high tech gizmo...  still, am optimistic about the success 'cos the respondents did not handle the product ......secondly i remember coke classic.. walkman...etc.. marketing research is not the one basis for decision making...  got the sniffles yesterday again...something is seriously wrong with my constitution, it no longer responds as well to mondays as it used to... my reasoning is that i build up the entire week in anticipation of sunday, and when sunday turns out to be a let down, then my system really crashes on monday,  lets see what i can do this sunday....  hmmmmm.......if i could run into  dominique , now  that  would really make my sunday.

      its been a number of days since i have been trying to think of the opposite for impending doom, cos thats how i have been feeling lately... the feeling that nothing can go wrong..that something great is on the horizon, and its impending.. if you get what i mean. celebrated my birthday a few days back ...rather low key.. fell victim to monday morning sickness this monday. turned out to be mild flu and a tummy upset.  feel good now thanks to the respite, after all its been a couple of weeks since i got to play some beach soccer, with the pressures of this world taking a toll on my poor weak soul!! reminds me of the principle on which they used to have a wooden shaft on the riverboat steamers of Mark Twain's time. if too much pressure built up then the wood would go first, preventing damage to costlier stuff, also the wooden shaft was easy to replace!!

      Learnt the following stuff about me at  urlLink emode . the site i head to when i am trying to kill time after office hours waiting for others to finish....  "  .... your most unique quality is that you're unusually Conscientious   You are the kind of person others depend on. You're competent, self-disciplined, and able to carry through with any plan you create. You've just got it together. You're also good at weighing the pros and cons of any situation and making sound, well-informed decisions. Compared to others who are conscientious, you are unusually reliable. Only 2.9% of all test takers have this unique combination of personality strengths.  "  not bad i say, i am a dependable guy!!

      I have been thinking...... when does a guy give up? when the cost of continuing is becomes greater then the potential benefit  to be received by persevering. therefore if the potential benefit is so great that no price you pay is too big, then you never give up!!  sounds a bit too logical  - rather cut and dried  but i think its exactly right.   of course only thing is that we often do not keep this in our head and when we give up in face of minor difficulties thinking ' bah! i've had enough' only to regret later that one step might have been it.  am getting too preachy, i must say!   am wondering if i can get a job copywriting, seems you cant work part-time unless you have some good experience and a sizeable portfolio. well, thats another problem i need to work around.   just have to remember when to give up.

      today is the day that should change the rest of my life.... i hope,   sleep has been hard to come by, this is what they mean by no rest for the wicked...and as i was tossing and turning in my bed at 5 am i thought ok, i might finally be in a position to go jogging today ( i never get out of bed before 7 am otherwise....even if my sleep breaks at 6) so after spending an hour convincing myself that i should go jogging and overruling excuses like:  1) ill get tired ( only the first few times) 2) i hate jogging ( which is true, i can run after a football ....but just running ??!!) 3) hard surface will kill my knees and ankles ( ...and stress, cholesterol will get all of me otherwise)  finally got up, made tea and watched some tv. much to the annoyance of my roommate. finally got ready and went down. and you cannot know how ridiculous i felt, all alone early in the morning with all the watchmen and milkmen staring at me, would be much easier if i had someone to jog with i told myself, but i dont lose some weight soon i wont have some one to watch tv with also. so i started and after the first three minutes it was sheer will power which kept me going for the remaining 12 mins. and finally dripping with honest sweat i made my way back to the flat, did some weights and was feeling great. so everything should be fine right? wrong, by 10 am i was feeling so sleepy that all i could think of was taking of going home and sleeping. somehow or the other i have managed to postpone my departure but with champions league beckoning tonight and not much work to do, i think i am all set to take of early today.  just hope i can fall asleep when i get home, like i said - no rest for the wicked.  jogging aside, am meeting a no of people from my old school days, met this charming school mate ( see life of a saint) who's studying design in UK and is back on vacation, then met another old friend from my college days just back from Boise, Idaho who's working in a chip firm....and one thing we had in common was the lack of affection for certain Korean firms who are giving us a tough fight in two totally different sectors.   looking forward to my trip home this weekend, its been a long time coming, but its finally here.

      just back from trip to one of my favorite places in the world......although the trip was official . the moment i step foot in bangalore (and i always reach early morning) i have this huge grin plastered all over my face. and if you saw me you would probably think i was a drunk lovesick fool, but that's the way the place affects me, especially after the dirt and grime of the city i stay in. its like getting into heaven after a life time in purgatory. and the expression on my face remains the same for most of my trip. auto guys probably think i am some sort of loony at large. too bad i got only a day there, did manage to visit my alma mater.....sadly the tsepak court was empty but still felt good to be there, mind was flooded with memories of the two years i spent there, and the canteen guy even remembered by name and roll no...  life is wonderful!!   also talked to an alumnus, who shared some gyaan about working and life.... and how he started his business......also got an invite to start a business with him ( very flattering) and would have jumped to it had i been married, still giving it a lot of thought though.....but had i a wife to support me :-) ......i wouldn't have thought twice.....after all one person in the family should have a regular income!!

      just saw   urlLink the cluetrain manifesto  , makes very interesting reading, and there must be thousands of such causes on the net, a hazaar bandwagons to choose from. climb on any oneor maybe start making one of your own....  why? well, i guess has to do with giving yourself a sense of purpose and the fact that when you see something going wrong you really cannot sit without trying to do something about it. and maybe thats where all the activism springs from. which is good for all of us....  and the  urlLink  cat fiasco ......i think it explains why so many people from DU seem to make it ever year ;-)

      reading ' power of now' and though i am rather wary of chicken soup books which promise success through 7 successful habits, am still always reading so called new age spiritual stuff. and the way eckhart tolle writes about his re-awakening takes me back to the time when i felt something quite similar to what he described.   my fingers felt translucent, and i felt as though the sunshine was coming though into to me and i was a light, bright sunlight filled soul. every breath i took felt as though i was breathing in rhythm with someone else, like it happens when two people lie in bed with one having his arms around the other. in the centre of my head i could feel s bond, like a third eye opening and the joy i felt was unlike anything i had felt or have felt since then.   and now i ache for the same feeling to return, wondering when.....and how do i get it back, and i know the answer to that too...  but this was a few months back on a sunday morning, on my way to the beach....  have had it since then, but the intensity has never been the same...

      as the year draws to a close, i reflect on the distance travelled over the past year. take a look again at my priorities and my goals and resolve to spend less time outside the moment and more time in it.   if it were possible to do an a,b, c analysis of what made me happy in the past year then 80% of it would the company of friends, 5% would be work i did on the job, 10% would be the sports i played, and balance would be misc.  and how often does one actually acknowledge the importance of our friends. the sheer joy one gets out of a two minute chat with someone close comes miles ahead of everything else, friends leave me positive and energised, and happy!!  also a year spent on the job trying to figure out what exactly would i like to do...would i rather chase a fat pay cheque in a conventional big corporation job, or hold out for something close to my heart....which seems some distance away....and the big corp might be the way to something else close to my heart. but again, its not so much big corp or small corp.....but what do i love doing...playing soccer....so while i look for a job which can keep me close to my passion for soccer, i am trying to figure out what is the route to that job and what are the milestones i need to cross on my way there....  one route takes me to harvard/ wharton thence to europe and man u or real madrid or even work in a city where i can watch some soccer regularly, where soccer would be as much a part of the culture over there as cricket is a part of the culture here. so given that i am seeking to get into a harvard or a wharton what is the kind of work i need to do to get there, and of course how much money do i need to accumulate....  another option is advertising and again the route seems to be the same....or do i step on water till i manage to break into it....and would it be enough  so what do plan for my life ahead:  travel , i defnly need to travel the world as much as possible meet my friends often give into impulses more, but also be more disciplined in other areas care for my health a lil more read all the books i can ( ties in very well with the travel, i think) learn a foreign language be more open and receptive to others be less wound up get over my tendency to analyse everything to death  and a basic tenet to remember, not to resist but let myself go with flow of life.

      work takes all my time these days, been leaving office at ten, eleven even midnight...and back the next day at 8 am. i never thought i would be one of those peope who spend all their time working, but it looks like i can be....  of course some credit must go to the new tt table in office, its been ages since i played , so i make sure to get my daily dose these days. add to that agency pitches for our business where i am getting a lot of gyaan. surely these days must pass.   also learning to dig deep and root myself within me so that i can control in my spitfire temper, highly unsuitable for a saint to have a temper.  saw some books i need to pick up,  five people you meet in heaven   being one of them, by the same author who wrote  tuesdays with morrie .   and read about the three types of love: lust, obsessive love, and comfortable love. well the best has to be when you experience all three with the same person and at the same time...  and here's to the holiday season!!

      added another page ( see sidebar -  astrology) , based on astrology, i am really fascinated by the stuff that comes up based on the position of the stars and the moon and the sun and the various planets.... how can these objects have an influence on my psyche and my personality?   or is there some giant secret book somewhere which has everyone's life in it, and the key to reading the book is the sky....ie the planets and the stars, and some of us have actually figured out how to read that book? or is it something written in the sky? which implies that we are born with a predetermined fate and destiny...which doesn't appeal to me, or rather i absolutely junk such an idea, so the reverse might be true...my actions here and now determine who and what i become and that is reflected in the stars?  its like a person standing next to a pond, and i can only see his reflection, not him, so i say he has a blue coat, red hat, moustache etc, but that does not mean that the pond decides what clothes he is wearing, its just that the pond shows me, but its the person who decides what he or she is going to wear...  hmmm, the same site actually told me something about soulmates too.....a very delicious memory..

      its been a long time since my last post here, and though i had many things to say, i was holding back, wondering whether to say them here. my life has been over taken by a feeling of joy and self fulfillment which i believe would be the natural state for evey man, not sadness, not anger, not despair, and not irritation. the basic and fundamental emotion underlying every life is a joy, a joy which comes from sheer existence and nothing more. and nothing less. other lower emotions may flit across the landscape of our mind like clouds, ephemeral as they are , but after the rain the soul returns to clear blue sky which is the happiness bubbling in our soul. and we do not remember this very often and indeed in the past year i had lost complete sight of this fundamental axiom of human existence, its only over the past few months that i have rediscovered it. and now i shall not let go! and this emotion comes not from the achievement of some goal, or from reaching a certain point, but its origin lies in my journey towards a goal, the goals may change ( ..or they may not) but the journey itself is accompanied by a feeling of bliss which tends to take away from the obsession towards reaching the goal, and gives to the journey. and it is not as if the goal is not important, but its just that journey is just as important to me.   wishing you joy

      back from the training trip. really enjoyed myself there. HK is a very well planned city, and its really convenient to get from any point a to any point b in the city. the metro is very convenient to use, with clear signboards and maps indicating where you are, and showing you how to get to where you want to go. fares are relatively cheap and the octopus card - a sort of prepaid card which automatically calculates and deducts your fare makes it even more convenient. and the card can be used on the buses, ferries and even to buy groceries.   what i liked best about the place though, was the public facilities for sports. near the hotel where i was staying ( harbour plaza - north point ) was a 7 a side footer ground. well laid out, with artificial turf and lighting too. and its open to public so you can play there quite easily and regularly. if only mumbai had something similar near where i stay then life would be almost perfect.   until then...

      My journey has taken another step, am currently in Hong Kong on training for my new firm which is into specialized sector specific marketing research and consulting for firms..i cannot reveal any more for security reasons :-)  so far the stay has been great, the journey was a little tiring, given that i stayed up all night to catch the 6 am flight ( had gone to a pub with my roomies... and by the time we got back was too late to catch some sleep). the flight was uneventful except for the quality of the food..But lets not get into that,  the trip to the hotel from the airport was great, with a huge bridge connecting the airport to the main island.. and room i got has a wonderful view of the bay, and in the morning i can see the sun rising over Hong Kong bay, the ideal setting for a morning cuppa.. and nights reveal the city's skyline which is almost as spectacular, and like raisins in a pudding, the star cruise ships keep appearing on the horizon. and then they make their stately progress towards the port, allowing for a closer view! and until i few days back, all i had was a post card on my desk, with the Star Cruise Aries in it!   Had Japanese food for lunch yesterday, was pretty good, followed it up with ... surprise suprise ..chinese food today... about 6 or 7 varieties of dim sums.. and a dish of mango dumpling or pudding which was excellent, and i must recommend the pork roast too, the name of the restaurant escapes me..but its on the second floor at taikoo place. the only concern as far as food is concerned - chopsticks, am battling valiantly, but for some one who is not used to a knife and a fork, handling chopsticks is going to take some mental effort  training has pretty cool so far, and trainers have been very forgiving of my penchant for nodding off during the sessions... i can always blame jet lag..  i wonder why the British left...... though they did leave a lot of their influence behind, atleast as far as streets and building names go,  here's to Hong Kong!

      it seems like only yesterday I was mourning Figo's loss of form at Turin when Real got knocked out by Juventus - after Figo missed a penalty. The next year they managed to surrender a 2 goal lead to Monaco and succumbed to Morientes.   France knocked out of the World Cup without scoring a goal - I thought ok, Zidane was injured and Pires was out. Euro 2004 was the stage on which the French national team was to do justice to the overabundance of talent they have, almost every area of the pitch bristling with world class quality.   It was like watching a bad movie, I didn't beleive what was happening and to the end I was sure that France would score. They didn't, leaving their supporters heartbroken once again. Atleast the English lost because they played suicidal football. The French lost because of the one goal they gave the Croats, making it necessary for them to win the final match. They couldn't rest their stars, we just to look at yesterday's quarterfinal were a shrewd Karol Brueckner (did i spell it right? ) sat back for a half and then strolled all over the Danes in the second.9 first choice players were rested in the 2-1 victory over the Germans, and it must have made a world of difference.  The French by constrast seemed to lack that extra second, that extra yard of pace and that steely resolve to win. They just went out and played. Dacourt in the middle for Viera was uninspiring, and Trezeguet chose the Euro to audition for the lead role in The Invisible Man.  Saha, and Rothen should have been first choices and Desailly should never have replaced the hard working Lizarazu. In the end we are all poorer for missing out on some more glimpses of Zidane's artistry. Which was absent for the most part of the Qf. The great man seemed to be tired of the lack of penetration up front and Henry's glaring misses, he really should learn to head the ball, would have done little to restore faith. Atleast Henry was missing the goal, Trezeguet was missing altogether. Reports say he was sighted near the penalty area, but we are awaiting confirmation on the same.  Missed the Sweden vs Holland match completely, but saw the penalties (was busy with my birthday party at the skybar... might have more on that later).. but mellberg's lack of confidence was so obvious i was pitying the poor guy even before he missed. my heart was rooting for sweden, three months spent there left me with a warm corner for the Swedes. But that too was not to be.  Nedved vs Figo, Ronaldo vs Barros - is what i am looking forward to..but the greeks and the dutch might have other ideas.  After all, Nedved was picked as Zidane's replacement at Juventus...  plan to catch some sleep before wednesday.

      Last nights match was without doubt the most exciting match of this tournament. The soccer on display was not the beautiful kind and England's answer to Pele left early with broken instep. Rooney ran took a couple of steps without his show as a defender trod on his heel. Not only was he penalised for that he also got his foot broken by Andrade ( was it? ). Owen had managed to put the English up by a goal, a long punt upfield by David James - a defensive lapse as Costinha tried to head, only to put in the path of Owen whose brilliant strike silenced the home crowd. But not for long, the Portuguese took command of the game as Scholes and Gerrard surrendered the midfield. Vassel on for the unlucky 'Pele' was obscure for most of the game.(but he was to make his mark at the very end). Ronaldo and Figo began running at the bunched up defence and a goal seemed inevitable. Deco was not at his best, but the 'talented' English midfield repayed Deco's generosity many times over, giving the ball away with the generosity of a russian oil billionaire. Gerrard was particularly wasteful, long or short, his passes never passed the portuguese. However Ashley Cole was brilliant in his shepherding of Ronaldo, without him, England would have conceded many more by half time.  But with Cole and the rest of the back four doing well, the Portuguese were held at bay for 80 minutes. Figo was among the players to be subbed, as Rui Costa and Postiga joined the fray. It was Postiga who headed in the equaliser which took the game into Silver Goal extra time. Sol Campbell had a 90th minute goal disallowed for Terry's foul on Ricardo, preventing the keeper from challenging.  The Portuguese were beginning to tire and England had more attacks on Ricardo's goal in extra-time then they had during the entire match. Rui Costa score a scorcher but Lampard was at the right place at the right time to pull the game level again.   And to the Russian roullete of spot kicks. Beckham blazed one over, but Rui Costa's miss meant that the game was tied at the end of five. Postiga and Ashley Cole duly scored the 6th round. Which brought Villa striker Darius Vassel to the spot. Ricardo saved his attempt and then amazingly went on to score the next one, lifting Portugal to a famous victory!  Some english papers claim they were robbed, but the foul was obvious and there was no way the Sol Campbell goal should have stood, and England didn't play well enough to win. One would think that after the 92nd minute heartbreak to Zizou's brilliance the English would have learnt not to sit on a 1-0 lead.   All in all a nice way to round off my birthday, though i managed only 2 hours of sleep, and the hours after lunch had me snoozing at workdesk. Thankfully, i can sleep tomorrow after the French have buried the Greeks. Prediction 5 - 1, 2 to Zidane, 2 to Henry and 1 to Pires.

       "I've finally learned to accept myself for who I am: a beggar for good football. I go about the world, hand outstretched, and in the stadiums I plead: 'A pretty move, for the love of God.'"--Eduardo Galeano, Soccer in Sun and Shadow   absolutely. says exactly what i feel. i wonder, how many soccer lovers are still bachelors?

        Day Four  Bananas and milk. Today you will eat as many as eight bananas and drink three glasses of milk. This will be combined with the special soup which may be eaten in limited quantities.   Ok, the special soup is too far away to be of any use. and considering the fact that i had 5 of the eight bananas allowed by 10 am, the day was looking particularly long. but now at 4 seems to be much better and day 5 calls for chicken / beef. so things are looking. and i do feel i have lost a quarter inch somewhere.  Back to Euro, France looked like they were going to score half a dozen and England looked like they were on their way home. But Rooney rescued England. And Henry scored 2 attractive goals. Finally. They were a long time coming but they finally got here. Sweden and Denmark can knock Italy out today if the draw. So after Spain's failure it looks like the Azzuri could be going home prematurely. And Germany looks shaky too, though I expect the Czech will rest their key players, which means the Dutch could be out too. Three big teams out already, but that should make things easier for Zizou and company. Vive la France!

      My roommate and I have embarked on the world famous GM diet plan. It is supposed to detoxify the system and promises a weight loss in the range of 5 to 15 Kgs. In seven days. Of course those who have more to lose will find it easier to hit the 15 Kg mark. I am sitting in office, day 3, feeling weak and hungry and wondering why am I doing this. After all I am in reasonably good shape and just a small paunch. Well the fact is that my small paunch seems to be getting larger by the day and if left to its own devices I'll soon be able to rest my key board on it. The issue is not so much the food I eat, its the lifestyle. Sedentary. I am used to playing something everyday, and on campus, even during the toughest days of tests and submissions there was always time to play a few games of tt or try my leg at some tsepak. But ever since I have started the job, such outlets of expression for my physical self have been conspicuously absent. Before I shifted residences I used to make up by avoiding the lift and using the stairs to get to my fifth floor apartment. And before I shifted jobs I could count in a couple of hours of tt, atleast 4 times a week. But now the I stay on the second floor. And the new place doesn't have a tt table. The only other option is to go jogging. Or to join a gym. Which will happen. Once euro 2004 ends, with zidane lifting the trophy. Until then, the GM diet plan is the only thing standing between me and a new wardrobe

      Had lunch at this place called Culture Curry, serves authentic South Indian food, with great variety and there is also goan or portuguese fare to choose from, on the whole an excellent place, highly recommended  this entire practise of treating a new entrant to lunch is going to have a heavy toll on my waist line,cos i am one of the first people to join and they are still recruiting..  will probably have to skip dinner...

      Just came across this post at Caliblog, which discourses on love and marriage. And most of the stuff is pretty much common sense but as that famous quote goes, it's pretty uncommon. Recommend a look at it. It also ties in with what I have been thinking for the past few days about patience, an often underrated and even overlooked virtue. In this day and age, where a consumerist culture propagates the virtue of indulging every whim, and instant gratification is the norm the pleasure of patience is not very evident. Especially since I am by nature impatient. If I have to do something I have to do it now. But my recent life has been showing me that patience is necessary, it's also better for my peace of mind. And since one of my other big strengths is perseverance, I definitely need a dose of patience.    urlLink Patience    Shed a tear 'cause I'm missing you I'm still alright to smile Girl, I think about you every day now Was a time when I wasn't sure But you set my mind at ease There is no doubt you're in my heart now Said woman take it slow It'll work itself out fine All we need is just a little patience Said sugar make it slow And we'll come together fine All we need is just a little patience (inhale) Patience... Ooh, oh, yeah  Sit here on the stairs 'Cause I'd rather be alone If I can't have you right now, I'll wait dear Sometimes, I get so tense But I can't speed up the time But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider Said woman take it slow Things will be just fine You and I'll just use a little patience Said sugar take the time 'Cause the lights are shining bright You and I've got what it takes to make it We won't fake it, Oh never break it 'Cause I can't take it  ...little patience, mm yeah, ooh yeah,  Need a little patience, yeah Just a little patience, yeah Some more pati... (ence, yeah) I've been walking these streets at night  Just trying to get it right (Need some patience, yeah) It's hard to see with so many around You know I don't like being stuck in a crowd (Could use some patience, yeah) And the streets don't change but baby the name I ain't got time for the game 'Cause I need you (Patience, yeah) Yeah, yeah well I need you Oh, I need you (Take some patience) Whoa, I need (Just a little patience is all we need) Ooh, this ti- me....

      Absence, they say, makes the heart grow fonder. Of whom, the wags ask. But once again it's been some time since my last post and a lot of water has flown under the bridge since then. Especially in Mumbai, where it's been raining cats and dogs for the past week and a half. I wade through knee deep water to get to work, and most of the office leaves by noon. Most of the people who are present i.e. . which of course begs the question, why do i, an acclaimed lazybag, take so much trouble to get to work. One reason is that there is a lot of work, another reason is that i am really having fun at work, so don't see why i should stay at home and get bored.  Hope to start playing soccer sometime soon, was on the cards for the last two sundays but cricket on the tube kept me away from soccer on the field. and India disappointed both times. I really expected them to do well in the final, especially after restricting the  urlLink lankans  to under 250 thanks to some splendid bowling by Tendulkar and Sehwag. Sadly the batting line-up disappointed, Sehwag couldn't get started, Ganguly fell cheaply, and Dravid followed suit.  Some positives, the team has made it to the final of every tournament they have played in since 2002, the victory over Pakistan was thrilling, Sehwag's spin seems to be very good, and Ganguly seems to have gotten through his lean patch.  That said, Sehwag seems to be inconstistent to keep the opening slot, i would prefer a return of the Sachin - Sourav partnership. But then Sehwag at number 3,4 or 5 doesn't make a lot of sense. At number 6 as the allrounder? nah.... and dropping him also seems to be out of the question. Sourav - Sehwag to open with Sachin at number 3 seems to make more sense, but is still too hard a decision for the current Indian tema management.  Schumacher continued his dominance. Real seem to have urlLink  got  Vieira, while Chelsea seems to have everyone else. Maniche seems to be the likely target to replace Patrick at Arsenal, though an Arsenal without Vieira is very much like the Lakers without Shaq ( yeah, shaq has left the Lakers, and so has Phil Jackson.. though Gary Payton will be with them...?? do they want to keep him)  thats about it for now, gotta go before the roads disappear under the water.  Meanwhile, Life is good, and getting better by the day (though i miss  urlLink him  )
