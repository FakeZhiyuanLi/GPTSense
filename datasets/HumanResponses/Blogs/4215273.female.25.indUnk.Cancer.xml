      You haven't vividly lived unless you have experienced being a woman. What is it in our genetic make-up that makes us so crazy? There is no middle of the road emotions... it's either exhilaratingly high or drudging through hell low. It leaves me with the endless task of trying to find that emotional middle ground call peace & serenity. Is there really a woman who possess a type B personality? It's a curious wonder of how women tend to live longer than men... It makes no sense considering how much energy women use to "feel." In my rough estimate, my fuse will blow out maybe in another decade. What exactly is our secret?  On the side note, I think my fairy godmother is still alive.  I hope she is not pissed at me.

      We don't really stop asking the darn question of why we're here on earth... what purpose we serve, if any? Everyone is really innately angry, their lives are fubar, the bottomline of everyone's life is just very sad. Are we already in hell? Is this hell? Are we in it suffering already? Why exactly are we here?  Craigslist's Rant and Rave section is the highlight of humanity at its best. Lately, there has been this huge discussion (and I am not using the word discussion in any means to denote a mature discussion,) about a women who is undecided on whether or not to tell the wife of this married man she has been having an affair with for five years that has recently ended. Responses ranged from guilty cheating men swearing at her at how bad of an idea that would be, to self righteous people who are just mad at her for having an affair with the married man, to people who are psychoanalytically angry with her and told her that if she was really trying to do the right thing, she would have told her earlier on and not after 5 years and after they have recently ended this nonsense... and the only reason why she would want to say anything now is because she really wants him back.  Then there are posts of these angry NYC men wanting to know why NYC women are such high maintenance bitches, and why they can't find a nice girl to settle down with even if their lives depend on it. Well, I know for a fact that it isn't just NYC... it's everywhere in the world. Recently, my ex of 5+ years told me that he is having sexual feelings for this woman at his work who is married, and she seems interested in entertaining the idea of having a physical affair. I told him... what the fuck is the damn point? Sure, you'll have a short term gain, but this shit will never work out in the long run, and people usually come out superbly FUCKED at the end (and not in a good sense.) It is ironic coming from my ex who has recently been divorced with his wife of less than 6 months. She cheated on him with this "older" guy in California and ended up moving there before the divorce finalized.  Am I right to conclude that people don't strive to learn from mistakes, but they'd rather fuck up their lives more afterwards because their lives are fucked up anyway, so why try?

      We're short on cash and we need to head down to NYC to meet one of my clients. I could not postpone it any longer because I have already done so last week, and it would just look really bad on my part. I am not unreliable... unfortunate circumstances just come upon me a little TOO often. Well, at least I think I am getting very much used to handling things in unfortunate circumstances, in that I have found a more leisurely way of getting to NYC... and probably much cheaper too. Yes, I am still very proud of myself for suggesting that we drive to White Plains first then take the MTA down to NYC to avoid the toll and the bridge traffic. Very proud indeed.  So much for wanting to hate people for the rest of my life. Jill came and bought a box of brownies for us. Sweet, moist, decadent brownies that took away a crap load of cynicism of my believing in only the existance of evils in this world. That's all it takes to buy me over to the good side... it's shamefully pathetic. I made a new friend today... a sweet, optimistic girl with a dream. I want to be like her and believe in my dreams again. I want to believe that miracles do happen... well, so much for that since I have already killed off my fairy godmother yesterday with a hit and run "accident." It would be a "real" miracle if she comes back to life... and not hold a grudge.

      It is so hard, especially for me, to find that balance... or that illusion of balance in my mind to keep myself happy. Once I finally did... and for a while too... life decides to hit a home run somewhere, smashes my window, and tips my scale. It feels as if the ceiling caved in again, dripping dirty water all over the floor filled with soggy foam. This time, instead of having to emotionally manipulate someone to stay and help me clean up the mess, there was someone there willingly and supportively helping me gather up the shattered pieces of my life.  Last night, as I sat down to do the math of it all, I realized... unlike all the times before, this time nothing was ever broken... nothing, except for me.

       Today is just another one of those drabby days. Gray skies, emotional calm due to my physical exhaustion after an anxiety storm, and now I am too tired to suspect and dislike people. I have never deliberately sit at the subway station and watch people go about their daily lives... although, I feel like if I was in NYC, today would be a good day to do it. I feel so unmotivated to do anything remotely useful right now. At this moment in time, my only wish is for me to return to my usual self before this whole crazy interruption has rudely intruded my life. Can events in one's life be totally and utterly pointless? Yes, it seems that by my watching really bad movies would confirmed the fact that the total and utter waste of time is part of the natural processes of life. This entry, like today, and many segments of the wasted time of my life, is completely... useless.

       One day, life seems just fine... in fact, it seems a little better than fine, it is great. If it wasn't for those days when little great things happen, I may not even believe in the reality of those days at all. Then comes the other days when everything becomes chaos... everything that isn't meant to be perceived as chaos becomes chaos. Life takes on a "life of its own," and it created for itself... the illusions of melodrama that feels very real.  Your mind is a very powerful thing. It controls you! The very existance of any traces of happiness can be wiped out if your mind decides that... I am not going to be happy today. Well, today is one of those days... this week is one of those weeks when people became "enenmies." My mind decides to read between the line to everything anyone can ever say... and it has came to a conclusion: People are selfishly evil. They all suck. Period.  Why are people so happy about their meaningless little lives anyway? There is nothing to be happy about. No one will be happy about it with you or for you. People wish other people to fail so that they can come out looking like a winner. They may not be, but at least they'd seem that way. They want the attention. All of it. If you were to disappear off of the face of this earth, they will not miss you. The world is about them. If they are innately not happy... they won't tell you because they want you to think that everything about them and their pathetic little lives are just wonderful. They think that real emotions are signs of weaknesses, and real meanings to life derived from those real emotions are what makes them vulnerable to the world, so they should all be avoided. Well, have a nice fake life, everyone. Maybe they will be happy all together not thinking of the fact that after the party is over, their life will return to the inevitable humdrum that it has always been. Isn't life a bitch?  I am mentally &amp; emotionally unstable. Wow! Really? What makes anyone think that? What makes anyone think that I may not be the only sane person in this world?
