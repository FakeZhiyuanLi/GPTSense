      Sometimes I think I have the word  sucker  plastered all over my face.  It's funny how things that may seem incredibly logical in the heat of the moment look pretty stupid in retrospect.  I was checking out the price of a book that a friend had recommended to me (The Five People You Meet in Heaven) on chapters.indigo.ca and it happened to be $5 cheaper online than in the store.  That sounded tempting except for the fact that shipping & handling was about $4.  But look... free shipping on orders over $39!!  So in order to save $5 on the book and $4 on S&H, I ended up buying not just the one book I intended to buy, but two others! Suckered by corporate marketing.

      Today I am most grateful for: - the safe arrival of my precious neice Madeline Olivia (hee hee... just call me Auntie Cindy!) - a special 2nd cup latte after a 2 hour commute into work - the thoughtfulness of a friend who called for no other reason than to say hi and that they were thinking of me

      I was doing so well in trying to eliminate my frivolous spending this month.  The only charges I made to my credit cards have been for gas, parking, and GO Train.  Then along comes this weekend...  Best Buy:  Olympus Stylus 300 Digital Camera & 256MB Photo Card - $539.98 (price drop $100) Disney Store:  Pooh Blanket & Piglet Rattle (for my soon to be nephew/neice) - $18 (reg price $36) Gap:  2 bras - $19.94 (reg price $84.50) Tristan America:  2 down jackets (for me & my mom) - $134.99 (reg price $350)  Total Damage:  $712.91  Total Savings:  $397.57!!   Now that I have my new toy to play with.. everyone beware!  Being Chinese and all I've gone extremely picture happy (... oooh look pretty tree, let's take a picture!)

       Gung hay fat choy!     So I’ve just spent the last hour staring at my Grandma.  We had gone to the mall after dim sum and while walking in, she slipped and fell.  She didn’t hit her head or break any bones, but was I ever scared.  It seemed like everything was happening in slow motion.  The mall security guy came pretty quickly and asked the paramedics to come just to be sure no bones were broken.  My Grandma’s sitting there in pain and fear, and her biggest worry is if she’d have to take her clothes off in the middle of the mall for them to examine her.  The paramedics cleaned up her bleeding lip and checked out her sore arm then cleared her to go home.  I don’t know what it is about paramedics but they are so hot!  I was spelling out our street name to one of them, and he’s like, “What was that again.. K-I-S-S-M-E, Kiss Me Drive?”  I immediately felt guilty for the flirting and tried to tell myself to focus, Cindy, focus.  That was way too much action for one day.. what a way to start the New Year.  Chinese New Years always seems to carry much more meaning for me than the Jan 1st New Years.  It’s not really about the eating or lucky money, but more so about clearing the slate and starting anew, and sharing your hope and well wishes with those you care about.  With a New Year always comes a period of reflection of the ups & downs of the past year and inevitably I always seem to reflect more on the downside of things.    This year the reflecting started early in December when I felt that my life had sort of come to a standstill.  I had established a usual routine of work, eat, KF and sleep, and squeezing in friends and family time on the weekends.  Around me, it seemed like my friends were all moving forward in their lives - getting married, buying houses or condos, exploring new jobs - and it felt like I was getting left behind.     Spinning, laughing, dancing to her favorite song.  A little girl with nothing wrong is all alone. -Norah Jones   I was comfortable and secure in my life but yet feeling quite unsettled.  Should I go back to school?  Find a new job?  Move to a different city?  Pick up a new hobby?  Dye my hair!??  I still haven’t really come up with any answers.  But somehow I’ve managed to convince myself to be patient and to have faith that in time my turn too will come, and I’ll find my way closer towards love and other good things.  So I seem to be starting the New Year hopeful and just a little bit giddy of the possibilities that the New Year may bring.

      Last night I kung fu'd for 3 hours in preparation for all the feasting I'll be doing over Chinese New Years.  Last night was also the first time I've ever felt such an unbearable amount of pain at KF.. to the point where I felt like crying out each time my leg was hit.  Instead, I bit my lip and told myself to suck it up!  Don't want the boys to think i'm not tough enough to play with them.  Now I have 3 big bad bruises on my shin to show for my "toughness".

      brrrr!!  So I think it's only about -12 degrees today (-20 with wind chill) and I really only have to walk less than 5 minutes from the subway stop to the hospital.  You'd think i'd be warm and toasty wearing wool pants, a sweater, fleece, wool coat, mitts, toque and scarf.. but nope!  Also you'd think having lived in frigid northwestern ontario for 17 years I'd be used to this stuff.  Why am I so wimpy now?!!!

      Some pharmie banter.. I was on call last night and my theory that the pages stop coming after I go to sleep continues to prevail. # pages 5pm-11pm:  7 # pages 11pm-8am:  1 (@7:30am)  My most amusing page:  Nurse  - Hi, I have this new patient admitted and the doctor and I wanted to know if you could tell us what meds he's on.  He's on something for his blood pressure.  Cindy - Well I'm not in the hospital right now so I can't come talk to the patient, have you asked the patient??  Nurse  - No the doctor is in the room right now.  Cindy - Okaaay.  Well why don't you try asking them after.  If you have any concerns maybe you could call the pharmacy they fill their prescriptions at.  Nurse  - Well he didn't come from home, he came from a place called.. *pause while the Nurse flips thru some papers*.. the Toronto jail.  Cindy -  You could try calling the jail?  Nurse  - Who would I talk to?  A police officer?  Cindy - I can't say i'm too familiar with the jail system.  Maybe they have a nurse or doctor who works there??  Nurse  - Oh I see.  Cindy - I'd suggest talking to the patient first.  Nurse  - Oh okay.

      I had a Moment today and I'm not even quite sure how to start describing it.  It was about 7:20am and I was on my way to work, getting onto the 427 southbound from the 401.  The sun was starting to rise and the colours which filled the sky just had me spellbound.  All I could see was deep oranges, pinks, then fuchsia, and finally violets & blues at the fringes.  The colours followed me along onto the Gardiner well past Ikea.  Of course one of my favourite songs, with or without you, came on and my eyes actually welled up with tears.  If I was in a different city or country, I would have described it as a T.O (travel orgasm), but I still can't believe it was in my own polluted and smelly Toronto.  I guess it just goes to show that anything or anyone can be beautiful when they're given the chance to shine.

      Boy, it’s amazing what a healthy dose of wasabi can do to soothe the soul.    Being the geek that I am, I actually looked up the mechanism of action of how wasabi causes your eyes to water and nose to run for one of the doctors I work with after a sushi lunch.  But I can’t seem to recall if it had any effects on endorphins.  Hmmm.. any thoughts??   Moving right along... Welcome and introduction.    I still recall the night a few years ago where my roommates at the time and I held a dinner party and invited a few friends over.  After eating, we were lounging around and the topic of journals came up.  Conversation mainly revolved around what we each write about and one of the guys was so curious to read our journals.  I know this is a censored version of what is usually for my eyes only, but hey it’s something.  I was mainly looking for a place to vent some thoughts, share silly stories, and leave little updates for those I don’t get to see often enough.  By no means could this ever replace a comforting phone call, letter, or warm hug, but when you’re bored or have some free time you’ll know where to find a little dose of Cindy anytime of the day.  So please, have a seat and get comfy.  I hope you enjoy your stay.

      I've been complaining all weekend about how i'm stuck at work in a place with no windows and everyone keeps telling me how beautiful and sunny it is outside.  Strangely what I want to do most right now is to go home, change into my fuzzy pj's, turn off the lights and turn up the music.  I can't decide what I'm in the mood to play right now though.  Maybe some Coldplay.  Maybe some U2.  It's kind of like when you're at a restaurant and can't decide what to eat.  You try and imagine what each of the foods taste like and without you knowing it your mouth starts moving.  Right now i'm trying to hear the music in my head and every now and then my head starts to bop.

      Some random thoughts and happenings today: - sooo doped up after taking a "non-drowsy" antihistamine last night.. guess my Asian enzymes aren't up for the metabolizing. - lots of crap talk with my patients.  not only are they constipated but they feel the need to describe it in detail to me, including how disappointing it is to look in the toilet after a good effort only to find a small stool. - one more day with my student!  just need to fill out a stack of paperwork and evaluations tonight. - a patient told me that she's thinking about naming her child cindy since i'm so nice :)  so yah, maybe she was just transferred from the psych floor and on some psych meds.  still gave me a warm fuzzy. - bought tickets to see damien rice at convocation hall apr 23 on a whim.  if anyone's free that night and interested, email me. - happy one month birthday to my beautiful niece madeline!

      Trying to amuse ourselves on patient rounds:  Nurse:   Cindy, I really like your necklace, where did you get it?  Cindy:   Oh thanks!  This guy I kung-fu with made it.  Nurse:   Sorry.. that you what with??  Cindy:   Kung fu.  My Student:   Is that what you guys are calling it these days?  Cindy:   Hey!  Watch it!  This is evaluation week.

      Crazy Monday morning stuff today.  My GO train was late, at least 15 new patients admitted over the weekend, and Milli Vanilli is playing on the radio as I write.  What's keeping me going:  countdown 55 hours til Sushi on Bloor!  I've had this bad hankering for sushi for the past few weeks and Konnichiwa avocado maki at lunch hasn't been helping much.

      I am an INFP.  That's what I found out the first week of pharmacy when we took the Myers-Briggs test.  I was doing some cleaning this weekend and found an old box of pharmacy stuff that I failed to purge after graduation.   Introversion  - People who prefer Introversion tend to focus on the inner world of ideas and impressions.  Work quietly, without interruption.  Need to understand the world before experiencing it.  iNtuition  - People who prefer Intiuition tend to focus on the future, with a view toward patterns and possibilities.  Relies on one's sixth sense.  Looks at meanings, relationships and possibilities.  Values imagination and inspiration.  Feeling  - People who prefer Feeling tend to base their decisions primarily on values and on subjective evaluation of person-centered concerns.  Tend to be sympathetic, appreciative and tactful.  Value harmony and work to make it happen.  Perceiving  - People who prefer Perceiving tend to like a flexible and spontaneous approach to life and prefer to keep their options open.  Seek to understand life rather than control it.    Characteristics Frequently Associated with INFP: Full of enthusiasms and loyalties, but seldom talk of these until they know you well.  Care about learning, ideas, language, and independent projects of their own.  Tend to undertake too much, then somehow get it done.  Friendly, but often too absorbed in what they are doing to be sociable.  Little concerned with possessions or physical surroundings.  What's amusing is that I scored full points for being a Feeler and zero points for being a Thinker!  I guess you can tell which of my organs is getting the better blood flow.

      The thought of cancer just terrifies me.  I can't think of anyone who's life hasn't been affected by cancer in one way or another.    I usually try to make a point of not connecting emotionally with my patients because I think I would just go mental thinking about them all the time, but there are some faces who are permanently etched in my mind.  One of my patients had osteosarcoma and was pregnant at the time she was admitted.  They gave her a prognosis of 6 months to live and yet she still had a smile on her face everytime I saw her.  I also think of this elderly Chinese man who was coming in for chemo three times a week.  He seemed like such a frail man, but you could see the determination in his face.  I just can't get the sounds of him retching out of my head.  A little closer to home, a good friend and a coworker, are both having investigations done next week for cancer.  The wait is driving me bonky and weighing heavily on my heart.  Please send warm thoughts and prayers their way.

      Thursdays come and I think about him.  I wish I could tell what he's thinking, but I just can't seem to read him.  Does he like me?  Not sure still?  Or is he just being nice now?  I know I still don't know him well enough.  What I do know is that when I see him or spend time with him, I'm intrigued and I want to get to know him more.  But how long do I wait before I become the fool?

      At KF last night...   Cindy :  I don't think you can reach me with your counter punch.  You might need to step in and punch.  Partner :  Okay let me try that.  *BAM* Cindy takes a punch to the upper lip.   Cindy :  Hmm.  I guess you can reach now.

      Despite all my previous grumblings about Valentine's day, I actually had quite an enjoyable evening at a friend's party.  See how pretty my cookies turned out...     It was actually quite an ordeal to make them!  I tried crushing the cinnamon hearts with a rolling pin by muscling my way through them, but they're pretty tough lil suckers.  So I ended up going to the toolbox and picking up a hammer.  That worked well, but I think I scared my family a bit.   ps. Thanks Mystery Boi for being my Valentine.  Raincheck on that game of Twister? ;)

      So maybe i'm starting to get more cynical with my old age, but what is the big deal with Valentines day.  I'm getting tired of seeing all the ads for chocolate, lingerie, jewellery, etc.  Do people actually find this romantic?  Is it really that special if you almost feel obliged to buy your loved one a gift or plan a special evening?  Do you really need a special day just to show someone you love them?

      it's the little things that make me smile.    it's not that he gives me free coffee or that he's a good looking guy who rocks on the guitar.  but it's the way he makes me special lattes with chocolate sprinkles.  and it's the way he looks at me and smiles when he says 'hey cin' every morning.

      As you can see, I’ve been a bit lazy lately with the blogs.  This past week I’ve just been so jumbled, I can’t seem to get any thoughts organized.  The few times I have been able to write something, I’ve ended up deleting it before getting a chance to post it because it left me feeling a bit too naked and exposed.  I can easily come on, be cute and tell my goofy stories, but I know that’s not what some of you are expecting.  And it’s not really my purpose either.    I’m not quite sure how to overcome the self-consciousness aspect of this online journal stuff.  I don’t even know who’s reading this besides the people who’ve emailed or talked to me about it.  I guess it’s just knowing that someone is reading this and can form some type of opinion about me based on what I write that freaks me out a bit.    I don’t really consider myself an easy person to get to know.  I’m friendly enough and can chat your ear off, but I’m not the most open person.  I don’t easily volunteer information about myself or my feelings, so it usually takes more of an effort on your part.  I’d like to hope that it’s worth it in the end.    Maybe we can compromise.  I’ll try harder to give you more juice if you will be patient with me.

      hee hee.. i'm surprisingly hyper right now after getting less than four hours sleep last night!  after having a late winterlicious dinner, I crashed at my old apmt downtown and of course we stayed up late chatting all night.  one topic that kept coming up - Caucasian guys dating Asian girls.  So what's up with this 'yellow fever' thing?!  my reasons why I find Caucasian guys attractive: - I grew up in small town T.Bay where I was related to all the Chinese guys - I also didn't think cute Chinese guys existed until I moved to TO - I have a complex dating guys with smaller waist sizes than me  one theory why Caucasian guys like Asian girls: - we're generally smaller, so we make them feel big and strong (good ego stroking)  any other thoughts?

      Last night I saw the movie “Long Life, Happiness & Prosperity”.  It’s basically about the challenges three Chinese families face as they each strive to live up to their personal expectations of a prosperous life only to realize that perhaps prosperity and happiness come in other forms.  Sometimes it can be right under your nose and you just don’t have a clue.  It’s a fun, quirky movie but the message does hit home.    When I graduated from pharmacy, I really wanted to be a Superstar Pharmacist.  Career satisfaction was so important to me, and I wanted to validate myself by doing research, writing papers, etc. on top of providing superb patient care.  After spending 10+ hr days at the hospital (and really only getting paid for 7.5 hr) I realized life just wasn’t good.  I signed up for some classes, like KF and belly dancing, started playing piano again, and made more an an effort to spend time with my friends and family.    Sure I still end up putting in 9 hr days at work right now, but there is so much more I look forward to and gain satisfaction from.  KF has become a big part of my life – not only is it a good physical outlet (hee hee.. my massage therapist teases me about my “bulging muscles”), but it’s great therapy for the mind and spirit.  I look at the relationships I’ve built with my closest friends and I’m comforted to know that we can mutually count on each for support and smiles anytime.    I guess it’s pretty surprising to me that in a matter of only a few years since I’ve graduated, I’ve already redefined what my impression of a successful life should be.  And even just a day ago, as I was holding my new niece in my arms, I’m thinking of the day when I start a family of my own and just how that could be the most successful thing I ever accomplish – to raise my children to be strong, loving and confident.  Boy… can you tell I'm getting old.

      I made an oversight yesterday at work which resulted in a baby getting twice the dose of a medication.  He's ok but it still doesn't make me feel any better.  We have all these processes in place to try and prevent errors and yet they still happen.  I didn't catch it when I wrote the order for the drug.  The doctor didn't catch it when she signed my order.  And the nurse didn't catch it when she gave the drug.  I know we're not perfect, and it's human nature to make mistakes, but that doesn't make me feel any less horrible.

      So I've been requested to elaborate further upon my last entry...  I guess I haven't dated anyone seriously for awhile now, and it hasn't really been a big issue.  I'm not the type of girl who needs a guy around to feel happy or to feel good about myself.  I'd like to think that I hold my own ground pretty well.  But lately I've missed that closeness.  I miss that feeling of knowing that someone could be thinking about you at any point in the day.  And I miss that hovering feeling that makes me feel so safe.  So what's the problem??  It just doesn't seem like paths are connecting.  I met a boy who I was into and who I thought was kind of into me as well.  So I put myself out there, but it just doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  Maybe I read him wrong or maybe he's just not ready.  Who knows.  Then this guy at KF asks me out last week.  I'm sure any other girl would be thrilled.  He's super sweet, has a good job, and owns real estate.  But I just didn't feel it.  And maybe that's my problem.  I rely so much on my gut feeling or what I feel in my heart that I'm not thinking straight.   I'm not overly concerned about finding someone or in a big rush.  I'm quite confident that my someone will come along soon and want to share in adventures with me.  But hey, if you know of any cute, sushi-eatin, music-lovin kind of guys.. you can always send them my way.

      I am finding it extemely difficult to stay awake at work right now.  I've been sitting here at the computer checking bloodwork and I guess I dazed out for a bit but kept on clicking away on the mouse.  Next thing I know, I had opened a word document and typed a bunch of gibberish.  Freaky stuff.  I think I operate on a bimodal schedule.  I'm quite awake in the morning (a good thing seeing as I have to be alert and thinking by 8am) and i'm awake at night too.  But afternoons are a killer.. I get into my zombie state.  Afternoon siestas would be nice.  luging pics: http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=6tdbk18f.3azgoefb&x=0&y=n5pr00

      Okay, so I was mistaken.. there are many trees lining the luge track.  Let's just say I got to know them well.  No injuries though.  As far as I can tell, only 2 bruises for me and a "chest wound puncture" for Newt who also made friends with a tree.  What an amazing way to spend the first day of spring.  We luged for a few hours, threw some snowballs, and drove through the snowy backcountry roads on the way home listening to 97.7 Moose FM.  The forecasts of rain seemed to scare away any other lugers and we had the track to ourselves.  Even though I had a bit of difficulty steering the luge, the hardest part was definitely the climb back up to the top of the run.  A chair lift would have been nice!  It snowed for awhile which just made it even more pretty and calm.  I was so content to just sit there and absorb the surroundings and quietness.  And of course, can't think of a better way to end the day than sushi!    Stay tuned for photos...

      Predicted forecast for Bancroft tomorrow: - snow changing to rain - high of 5 degrees  I am so hoping the weather will work out tomorrow.  It'll be fun to get out of the city for the day and go try something different.  Hee hee, hopefully I'll be able to steer a luge better than I can drive an ATV.  At least there won't be any trees for me to hit.

      Let me just start by saying I have the bestest friends.  You guys make me laugh, keep me sane, and drive me bonky all at the same time.    Saturday I had the chance to catch up with a friend I've known since grade school.  Still the same Jen.  Not that I'm against change, but it's comforting to know that there are some things from your childhood that haven't changed too much.  Thanks for the reminder about grade 8 graduation.  Picture 4 girls dressed in frilly poof dresses standing outside 7-11 waiting for our parents to pick us up after the grad dance.  A guy gets out of his car and goes "12 or 13?".  We yell out proudly "14!".  He looks at us strangely and just walks into the store.  It took us a bit to realize that he was asking if it was our grade 12 or grade 13 grad.  And to think we were so offended that he thought we were only 12 or 13 yrs old.  Definitely a winning moment in the life of Cindy.  Had fun crashing a friend's friend's party again.  Although I'm a bit disappointed this time..  no twister game!  But hearing the story about my favorite electrical engineer setting his kitchen on fire and having his dorm evacuated while he was trying to cook  instant noodles  well made up for that.  Remind me that when we make dinner plans - we go out for sushi.  Today we caught the play China Doll at the Tarragon.  I was pretty amazed by how powerful the production was.  I get shivers thinking about how painful and crippling foot binding was.  It's hard to imagine that women were subjected to this in order to achieve what society considered an ideal beauty trait.  But then again, that was hundreds and hundreds of years ago, and look what people are doing today in their quest for physical beauty - plastic surgery, breast implants, liposuction.  Maybe we haven't progressed that far really.  Thanks again everyone for the great weekend.  Feels like home.

      Being in the health care field, I have this tendency to self-diagnose any problems or symptoms that I have (ie. my narcolepsy issue).  I believe my latest ailment is SAD - seasonal affective disorder.  Earlier this week, I was in a super mood.  The sun was out and shining bright and I could almost feel the spring fever coming on.  I'd put some Jackson 5 on the stereo and I was all set.    Today is a different story.  It's a bit colder and the sky is sooo gray and gloomy.  I have Damien Rice playing and here I am sitting in my pj's wondering whether I should call it an early night and crawl into my warm cozy bed, or if I should drag my sorry ass to KF.  Feeling rather unmotivated and sluggish.  I think I'll go into hibernation now, let me know when spring gets here (or if anyone feels like some sushi).

      once in a while it's so nice to have a day off and have absolutely nothing planned.  yesterday, i slept in until 8:30, went for dim sum, shopped for Baby Einstein DVDs, bought some fruit (big yummie red grapefruits!), then just loafed around and watched cheesy daytime tv until KF.  it may sound like a hum drum day to you, but i loved it!  one of the first things i noticed when i moved to Toronto was that everyone always seemed to be in a rush somewhere.  i wasn't sure where they were all rushing too and sometimes wondered if they even knew themselves.  now, 8 years later, i find myself driving faster and walking faster.  as if i don't have enough problems crossing the street, i often jaywalk and when i see the flashing hand at a crosswalk, i'll pick up the pace to make it across.  if i'm coming down the stairs at the subway and hear the train coming, i'll speed up.  and sure enough, i have no clue why i'm in such a rush and where i'm even going.  i don't think that 5 minutes of my life is so precious and valuable that i can't take a moment to breathe and just take in what's going on around me at the moment.  time is going by fast enough without me picking up its pace.

      I have resorted to being a snob at work.  I used to say hi and smile and talk to pretty much anyone, but now I'm just creeped out.  I could handle the cheesy pick-up lines and the winks and thought it was pretty harmless.  My co-workers even joked and teased me endlessly about my "friend".  I thought my limit of tolerance was when he kissed me on Christmas Eve under the pretend mistletoe.  But now it's just creepy the way they look and stare.  And now it's not just him but his all his buddies too.  So i'll avoid the caf at certain times of the day now and go around the hospital to a different entrance in the morning just to avoid them.  When I see any of them in the hall, I stare straight ahead and pretend I don't see them.  Snobby snobby me.

      She has been homeless in the past and honestly admits that she's not sure who the father of her baby is.  She smokes and her personal hygiene is not the best.    It's easy to look at her and wonder if she'll be a good mother.  The doubts started forming in my head whether she'd be able to take care of her baby adequately.  Boy did she prove me wrong.    Every day, she's here at the hospital before 8am and spends at least 10 hours here caring for her baby.  Her intelligence is so evident when you have a conversation with her.  I'm envious of her knack for remembering names and faces.  She says she was shocked to find out she was pregnant but now that she has her baby, she's devoted her life to taking care of him.  And it's apparent in her excitement over every little milestone he passes.  It's so infectious, you can't help but smile when you talk to her.  I guess that's where the difficulty lies.. breaking down the pre-conceived stereotypes we have formed in our heads and trying not to judge.  She deserves to be treated with the same respect and compassion as any other patient.

      I fell off the bandwagon today.  I had been doing so well in controlling my obsession for cute things and haven't bought any Sanrio or Pooh bear stuffs for so long now.  Then today it all came crashing down.  I was at Roots Kids looking for gifts for my lil cousins in the US since my Aunts are leaving tomorrow.  Then I saw  it ... a deliciously cute red tee.  And to test my will power even more, they had my 2XL size and was on sale too!!  So I caved.  Sometimes the cute thing works in my favour, so it's not always bad.  On our way to Cancun, I was wearing my "Sweet but Forbidden" tee and instead of being grilled about where I was going or what I had in my bags, the security dude wanted to know more about whether my shirt represented my personal philosphy in life.    And the cute thing works against me as well... ie, being called the "little pharmacy girl" by one of my patients.  Rather than listening to me talk about his life-saving drugs, he was more focussed on finding a candy for me in his drawer.    I guess one of these days i'll grow out of this cuteness thing and finally grow up.  But in the meantime, I'll keep wearing my red skater shoes and pink hair bobbles proudly!  When i'm fifty and if I still have a Pooh doll hanging off my backpack, someone please give me a swift kick.

      I just found out today that my hospital's been ripping me off for the past 2 years!!  Turns out, human resources hasn't been advancing me along the pay scale.  I started out at the 3rd level for pharmacists since I did my time as a resident, and i'm still at the 3rd level now.  I've been getting my yearly inflation raises so I really haven't questioned my salary at all.  I thought it took several years to move up on the scale, but turns out we move up each year until we get to the 6th level.  Hmm.. I smell a big fat retro-pay cheque coming my way.  It's nice getting money that you didn't know you had to begin with.. kinda like reaching into a coat pocket and finding twenty bucks.  Too bad mr.tax man will take a big chunk of it away.  I think it's time for Cindy to take a vacation.

      Nostalgia has hit me rather hard.  After work yesterday, I really didn't feel like going home yet, so I walked around downtown for awhile and I just found myself in such a daze, lost in memories that I had stored away.  Maybe i'm getting old.  Maybe it's the changing of the season that's causing this stir.  Spring has always been a symbol of growth and new adventures for me, and it's hard to take a step forward without looking back at how you got there.  One thing I find difficult to accept is that there are some people who were once such a constant force in my life who have all but practically disappeared.  Sometimes it's distance that has separated us, new relationships, or maybe our paths have just diverged.  I miss their smiles and teasing, and insight.  I'm beginning to think that people come and go in our lives at certain times for a reason.  They come to provide a much needed comfort, to open our eyes, to teach us about love and understanding others.  So really, I should be grateful to have had my moments with them.  It still makes me want to go and give everyone around me right now a big hug, since who knows ten years from now where we'll all be.  Maybe a few of you will even be part of my five people that i'll meet in heaven.

      heh.. so you know it's not a good sign when your KF instructor spends a good part of the lesson laughing at you.  and i'm not just talking about a few chuckles here and there, he was practically doubled over in laughter.    i was trying to jump into the air and do a 360 while holding onto a stick.  not so gracefully, i kept doing these funny pirouette like things, and my legs kept getting all tangled.  yah, not a pretty site at all.  and it kept getting worse as the night wore on.    i know i need to practice those 360's, but i think at this time, it's just a lil too embarassing to do that in public.  hee hee maybe i'll just close the door and jump around in my bedroom.  *btw.. deleted the last blog.  too many crude emails about my butt.  ha ha.. you guys are so funny.

      I’m homesick.  Maybe it’s the reminiscing with JenK about our grade school days.  Maybe I’m listening to too much Blue Rodeo.  It’s where I grew up and where all my childhood memories lie.  Obviously I’ll always have that hick connection no matter where I end up.    In some ways, I wish my grandparents still lived there so that I could make my yearly visit.  It was always such a refreshing escape.  Time seemed to go by much slower.  People are more laid back and carefree.  The air cleaner and gentler on the lungs.  Less concrete, more trees.    I guess you can take the girl out of the small town but you can’t take the small town out of the girl.

      I love my tungsten palm.  I play Monopoly with him on long subway rides and he remembers all this stuff for me, like drug info & phone numbers, that I can't seem to fit into my brain.  But last night, I almost threw him out the window.  Technology is great and all, but who's bright idea was it to have the palm flash & vibrate at 2am so that you acknowledge he's updated the time for daylight savings.  I didn't know what the sound was at first and thought I could just ignore it.  But by the 3rd time, I was so annoyed I had to get out of bed to investigate.  I find him sitting there on my table, all lit up, ready to vibrate every 5 minutes until I'd come to tap a button.  Brilliant.

      I drove to work this morning which I never do, and because of my deficient time perception abilities, I walked into the hospital at 7am (1 hour early!!).    Besides the fact that I'm a dork, today is going to be a good day.  Three reasons why:  1.  I'm leaving work early at 2pm to go to the spa for a massage!  This is my treat for getting my blue belt.  I'm not really a girly-girl, but I love the spa.. it's so relaxing there, and they always make you feel so special and pretty afterwards.  2.  Sushi Tei for dinner!  I know, I know, I talk a lot about sushi.  But for a little girl, I really take pleasure in eating, and sushi is one of my four basic food groups.  I was watching a show on the Food Network the other day and the guy had this huge slab of salmon that he was preparing to grill and all I could think was "mmmmm... salmon sashimi!"  3.  After today, I have 4 more days of work and 1 night on-call, then I'm off for 6 whole days!  What's a girl to do with all this free time?!

      On Saturday, as we made our way to Chinatown, we walked by the place I used to meet him for sushi.  The place I always had trouble finding before, but now was so in my face at this moment.  Foolishly, I had convinced myself that maybe he just is that slow and that if I’m really really patient, he will eventually realize that he’d like for me to be a part of his world.  Reality check:  Move on!  I bet he already has, my turn.  She’s finished her 1st cycle of chemo and looks super, strutting around in her pink shoes, makeup all done, clutching her faux Coach bag that she picked up in NYC.  The steroids have made her a bit hyper, but you’d never guess just from looking at her that there’s this crazy battle going on inside her body right now.  Reality check:  She will lose her hair.  She will have down days and at some point she likely may look “sick".  I must be strong.

      cindy logic:  1.  To accommodate for my bad time perception abilities, I had set the clock in my car to be 5min fast.  Then on it’s own will, the gap between cindy time and real time got wider and there was a 7min difference, and recently 10min.  So I’ve outsmarted the clock now and subtract 10min from whatever time it reads.  Maybe I should put it up to 15min fast.  2.  A friend brought back shortbread cookies for me from her trip to Scotland.  As I’ve been feeling a bit ‘biggish’ lately, I thought I’d hide them for now.  Yesterday night after the symphony, I got a sweets craving, so I pulled them out of their hiding spot and had a bite  (then I re-hid them again).  It all makes perfect sense in my head.

      I'm a wee bit embarassed (okay.. a whole lot embarassed) to admit I watched an hour of the Swan pageant last night with my sister.  At first I thought it was a pretty sweet deal.. a personal trainer to whip you into shape, a Ferrari, $50 000, etc.  Then as the show wore on, I realized not so sweet a deal to have to be called "a Swan" the entire night.  Why don't men do this type of thing?  What would they be called.. the Gander?!  An amusing remark.. my sister said she'd enter her BF if they had a male version.

      I was cleaning out email (yup that's how exciting my day off has been thus far, besides doing massive loads of laundry).. when I came across the Amazing Race emails Christine & I (aka 2 Asian Flower 1st time backpackers) sent from Greece last year:  ... The bus from the Athens airport to city center was long and bumpy.  Christine looked ill during the ride and Cindy tried hard to block the sounds of the smooching French couple behind us.  By the time we arrived it was dark and after 8pm.  We managed to navigate our ways to the hotel we planned to stay at only to find they were full.  The guy directed us to another hotel and we had to bargain with a 10yr old kid over the price of the room, only to lose.  ... We arrived in Santorini and tried to find our bus into Perissa beach only to realized we had less than 1 euro between the 2 of us.  Thank goodness for ATM machines!    ... Our "taxi ride" was arranged through a travel agency which was actually just a boy driving us with a rental car. He turned up the techno music and we were off cruising down the mountain side at breakneck speed. The driving lanes barely fit 2 lanes of cars, however, our driver decided that was more than enough room to pass not just a car but a bus at the same time around the blinded corners. The scenery of the cliffs and water was beautiful - when we were brave enough to open our eyes.   ... Our short stay in Pireus consisted of a few hours sitting in the metro station and a few hours sitting in a cafe having old Greek men watch us eat our sandwiches very slowly. Pireus was definitely a dirty, fishy smelling place and we were more than glad to get onto our 13 hour ferry ride to Rhodes. We watched a movie about this psycho girl who kills her grandmother, social workers & others, then we were ready to sleep.   ... We also took a daytrip to the city of Lindos and climbed to the top of the Acropolis admist piles of donkey dung. Afterwards we washed our feet in the beach trying to avoid looking at all the old, ugly topless sunbathers.   ... The ferry was much, much older (think rusted life boats) and a lot more dirty (think old, ratty, smelly bus seats with no air circulation). The atmosphere seem to coincide with the clientele of the ferry. It became apparent to us early on that the ferry was also being used to transport criminals. We noticed a couple of shady, toothless men smoking at the table in front of us, handcuffed together, while another man sitting a few seats back watched over them. Interestingly enough, we were keeping a more watchful eye on the 2 men and their movements than their handler who seemed more fascinated by his cell phone.   ... The next morning we started our ascent up the 950+ steps to the Palamidhi fortress. We though we were making pretty good time when we were passed by a quick footed, middle-aged couple, practically sprinting up the steps. The size of the fortress was astonishing and the view from the top of the entire city was amazing.   ... From Nafplio, we headed to Sparta, having another Amazing Race-like moment as we caught the connecting bus from Tripoli. Picture 8 backpackers of varying ages, speeding down the streets looking for the bus stop, thinking we only had 10 minutes to catch the connecting bus from Tripoli to Sparta. We ended up following each other in circles until we found the bus stop (which was actually just a cafe). Thank goodness for Greek Standard Time, as we ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes for the late bus.   ... The view of Athens from the top of the Acoprolis may have been much more memorable had it not been for the brown/grey "blanket" of smog covering the entire city.   ... We've come to the conclusion that a) prices are a lot more expensive than we anticipated and/or suggested by the guidebooks apparently with the introduction of the Euro everything in Europe is more expensive; b) We have no bargaining power when we are hot and sweaty after walking around with our packs AND they know it! c) We were much more anxious to drop our bags off and go exploring than we were willing to walk around looking  for a place.   ... We didn't do too badly though in regards to our budgeting.  We actually ended up with a few Euro left at the end of the day (we won't mention our thrifty meals of fast food gyros, supermarket purchases of large cartons of juice...)   hee hee.. can't wait until the next travelling adventure!

      My beef for the week..  KF boys who don't wash their arm/leg pads regularly.  We have to work pretty close together sometimes and I understand it's a sweaty environment and boys tend to get more sweaty than the girls.  But please have consideration for the people around you and control your stink!!

      I have a new toy!  What could it possibly be.. an iPod? .. PS 2??   or...  How about a hand blender! I've recently become addicted to smoothies from Cultures and each time i'd watch in awe as they pulled out their hand blenders and blended away.  It looked like lots of fun.  So you can just call me the queen of smoothies now.  It's my new breakfast treat.. just toss in some bananas, strawberries, yogurt, milk & orange juice and blend!  Yummie stuff.  I can't wait until the weekend when I can go grocery shopping to get more fruit.  I'll experiment with some different flavours and combinations first, then i'll be ready to take your orders!

      I've finally made the decision to get braces.  I've been debating... but my bottom teeth could really use them.  The orthodontist said my top teeth were ok, about 2% offline and a little bit of crowding.  But since i'm getting them, I may as well just do it all.  It's a lot of money, but it's an investment in me.. I try to keep telling myself.  He also reassured me I could continue eating sushi.. guess it can't be all that bad?!  Just letting you know, after July 3rd, you prolly won't see me smile for the next year and a half.

      I got my retro pay today.  For some odd reason, the thought of it coming was a lot more exciting than the actual moment of receiving it.  It's still quite a significant chunk of money even though 47% of it was taken off for deductions.  I wish I had some business sense in me cuz I can't seem to make sense of it all.  I need accounting help!!

      I hope my bra behaves today.  I got one of those convertible bras from the Gap last year and I just love it.  It's padded but isn't so over-the-top padded that I look dysproportional for an Asian girl.    So last week I was at a party when I felt something touching my neck.  I was pretty sure I had taken off my work ID tag, so I checked and it was my bra strap!  One side of it had unhooked.  No one was around me at the time and I thought, no problem, i'll just hide it under my shirt then sneak out to the washroom.  I was having problems tucking it into my shirt and of course right then people started to come over.  I guess the anxious fiddling just unhooked the other side and my strap came off, kind of dangling off my shirt.  I made a quick sweep, grabbed it, and stuffed it into my pant pocket.  Hopefully no one noticed.. or if they did, they must have been too embarassed to say anything.  Let's hope I don't flash anyone with my bra strap today.

      So what do you do when people start bad mouthing another person you know?  During the usual "locker room talk" after KF class, a couple girls who I hang out with at KF were saying that one of the instructors had a really mean side to him.  I said that i'd never seen it before, but they insisted it was there.  I actually had quite the opposite opinion of him since he's always been so nice and friendly with me.  But now that they've planted that seed of doubt, it's there in the back of my mind no matter how hard I try to suppress it.  I still think he's a real sweet guy, but my view is a tad tainted unfortunately.

      Everyone needs a good ego-stroking now and then.  This morning he told me I was one of the sweetest girls he's ever known and that I had this innate ability to make people smile whenever i'm around.  It was actually a kind of awkward moment, but i've had this silly grin on my face since.  Maybe i'll pass on the warm fuzzy today and tell someone too what a superstar they are.

      It's pretty amusing how such a little person can have such immense power over you.  For someone so cute, Madeline sure is one cranky baby.  She has the bottom lip pout completely mastered.  I was trying everything to keep her happy.. bouncing on the ball (and she only likes the slow bounces.. i.e. the ones that really work your quads), singing the Sound of Music, playing disney tunes on the piano, dancing around the house.  Man, she sure knows how to tire out Auntie Cindy.

      sooo cannot concentrate or focus right now.  i've been sitting here in my lil office staring at the computer for the past hour.  feel so unproductive.. just wasting time... yet i can't just get up and leave work this moment.  i'd get up and take a walk but i've just found the most comfortable position in my chair.  i have my shoes off and sitting 1/2 cross-legged.. gimp leg propped up.  wasting more time.. posting mindless, senseless blogs.  wasting your time reading them.    1 1/2 more hours til i can leave.  (i really do work when i'm at work... really)

      I was getting so frustrated at work this week.. getting yelled at by nurses looking for their missing drugs, co-workers not pulling their own weight, and having to deal with upper management and the politics.  Yeh, it really made me start to wonder why I'm even here.  And then I got my reminder today, right on cue.  I was consulted to see a patient who's on a slew of meds and has had chronic pain & fibromyalgia for the past 20 years.  She was so worried about what was going to happen when she came to the hospital to have her baby.  I chatted with her for only 30min and afterwards she was just so thankful.  It was such a warm feeling knowing that I could help ease some of her concerns and make her feel better.  Yep, guess that's what it's all about.

I've been trying to work on this research protocol but I keep getting distracted.  I've signed up for internet banking finally, done some online window shopping, caught up on email.  And when i'm just sitting here, I get an awful case of the munchies.  I ate my baggie of almonds in one day which was supposed to be my snack for the week.  It's a good thing I'm kung fu'ing for about 5 hours this week.  So does anyone else besides jenK, the brooder, vivi & soh nui have blogs/online journals??

      Like many girls, I love the fantasy aspect of weddings.  I know reality is a different story, but it never stopped me from watching The Wedding Story on TLC religiously in the past.  More & more I wonder tho if i'm really destined to get married.  Making that commitment to someone is a pretty big decision.  I mean it took me 15min the other day deciding what pattern socks to get at the GAP.  How do you really know that someone is the one?  And people change, it's a part of life and growing up.  I am definitely not the same person I used to be 5 years ago.  So how do you know what each other will be like 20 years from now?    I'm not a proponent of divorce but I'm also not against it.  It's reality and it happens.  People make wrong decisions in their life all the time and we learn.  So where is all this stemming from?!  I went to a bridal shower last week and have another one this week, so there's been a lot of wedding talk going around.  But more so, my friend asked why I wouldn't give this guy who's divorced a chance and I couldn't come up with a good reason.  Besides the fact, my family would have a cow over it, it just doesn't feel right.  Maybe it's the baggage.  We all have baggage to some degree but some people have heavier baggage than others and an ex-wife just seems like a lot of baggage.  But other than that, he's apparently a super nice guy, has a successful career, and knows how to treat a girl.    Quick poll:  Would you date someone who's divorced?

      Let all that you do be done with love - 1 Corinthians 16:14  last night i came home after the wedding and just sat there staring at the salt & pepper shakers thinking about the events of the day.  mmm.. i just love weddings.  i know that's quite the girly-girl thing to say, but i just love it all.  silly games, long-winded speeches, baby photo slideshows.. i just eat it all up.  last night was great having all my closest friends together again.  this has been a good weekend.  i took advantage of my new club membership for torn ACL gimps friday with sushi and poker.  never thought i'd be getting orthopedic advice from an engineer!  wedding saturday and babysat Madeline today.  she's 5 months old already!  and getting cuter each time i see her.  i'm looking forward to having this week off work.  hopefully the swelling will decrease since i won't be on my feet all day.  maybe, even maybe, i'll be well enough to go into the studio and do a bit of light KF.  to the delight of everyone, i'll stop moaning and groaning about my gimp now and all the things i can't do and just suck it up.  i have an appt with the surgeon in 1 week and i'm feeling better now that i know he has a good reputation and even works with the Argos.  hmm.. Canada votes tomorrow.  it's kinda scary, i don't have a good feeling about any of the candidates.  i can't say i'm confident that any of them will keep their election promises.  it's like choosing the lesser of all evils.. i'm voting more to exclude someone from office rather than to put someone in.  everyone remember to vote!

      still inflammed.  still throbbing.  still rather bummed out.    it's hard adjusting to the gimp.  i never realized how so much of what i do is physical in nature.  it's quite a shock on the system to go from walking an hour a day plus KF'ing 2-3x/week to sitting at home doing leg lifts in front of the tv.  i had one super good day where i got really motivated and did a bunch of sit-ups, upper body KF stuff  plus my physio exercises.. but i haven't gotten back to that point again.  i'm sure once i start to gain weight, i'll freak out and get my butt into gear.    thanks everyone for the cheer-ups (harry potter, sushi, shrek2, lending dvd's, warm wishes and hugs)

      so looks like i may have torn my anterior cruciate ligament.  they said about 2/3 of people won't require surgery and their ligament just reattaches at another point or they get along by modifying their activities.  the other 1/3 just can't seem to function without surgery.  i have an appt with the orthopedic surgeon in 3 weeks and by then some of the swelling should go away so they'll have a better assessment of where i fit in.  apparently my leg is very swollen (and i was telling everyone it wasn't swollen.. thinking i just had big KF legs) and it'll take about 6 weeks for the blood to resorb and go away.  i was pretty depressed about it yesterday and let myself be a suck about it... went shopping and bought a couple pretty things to cheer myself up.  today i'm determined to start thinking good thoughts.

      strange stuff still happening to me.  last night at queen's park subway station, this drunken man kept trying to make conversation with me and i just wasn't in the mood to play along.  and since it was later in the night (8pm'ish), the trains weren't coming quick enough.  dude was pretty determined tho, he followed me as i walked all the way up the platform, then back, then weaving around the poles.  at one point he tried to grab my arm, but with his drunken reflexes, he wasn't too fast.    i made an appt with the sports clinic at the hospital to check out my leg tomorrow night.  i'm really really scared i did something bad to it now.  for a lack of a better way to describe it.. i can't fully straighten out my leg and if i put too much pressure on it, it gives out.  i keep hoping it's just inflammation and ibuprofen will cure.  wish me luck tomorrow.

      So whatever's been going on with me has just got to stop!  Last week, I forgot to get off the GO train then messed up my knee, yesterday I had the call night from hell (see below) and this morning I locked myself out of the car at the train station while leaving my bags in the car.  Whatever this is, I hope it passes soon.  It's not even full moon anymore.  I think last night was the worst on-call night i've ever had.  Non-pharmies feel free to tune out now.  I was on the phone from 8-10pm and at one point had 5 calls in limbo while I was looking up info.  Then at 11pm I had to come back to the hospital to  compound  sodium benzoate oral solution for this pt in emerg with high ammonia levels.  Picture me, weighing out sodium benzoate powder then pulling out the beakers and stirring rods.  Flashbacks of orgo labs!  I was technically supposed to make the product in the sterile hood, but I figured since the pt was from a shelter and her gut is definitely not sterile, it shouldn't be a big problem.  And technically I was supposed to check the pH of the solution and adjust it with HCl or NaOH to achieve a certain pH.. but at midnight, I wouldn't even know where to go to find pH paper.  I was more preoccupied with getting the dang powder to dissolve.  Then after I get home (scary driving home in the thunder & lightning storm), I get another page from this resident about this pt with subtherapeutic phenytoin levels, who's now NPO and has brain mets.  I think I was ready to seize at that time.    So ready to crash right now..

      Feeling so blah today.  I'm stuck at work and finally have a moment to get some food into me.  Still have a kazillion things to do before I leave today tho.  Yesterday was the KF demo and I thought I was good to go when I woke up in the morning.  My leg felt not too bad, just a bit wobbly now and then.  My KF instructor even taped and wrapped my leg up real well just in case.  But it ended up going funny again during practice, so I watched from the sidelines.  I know I should take better care of my body but it kinda took awhile to get that into my head.  I guess since I'm a generally healthy person, eat well, exercise, etc.. I always thought I was pretty invincible and that aches & pains will just go away.  Yeh, I'm just getting old.  I think if you were to graph my emotional status and spending habits, you'd notice quite the positive correlation.  I'm an emotional spender, and that's a bit dangerous at this point with this funk i'm in.  I've already gotten a new phone, booked a hair appt & pedicure for this week.. what next?  hmm.. anyone want to run away with me right now and go on a vacation!?

      I was such a winner yesterday!  I had made plans to meet my demo partner at KF for 6pm to practice and was so excited I left work on time to make it.  I must have dozed off on the train and ended up missing my station.  And what's even funnier is that I didn't believe him when he called out the station name.. I thought, there's no way we could be there already, he must have made a mistake.  But when he didn't correct himself and I looked out the window, sure enough wrong station!!  I jumped off and ended up having to call my dad to pick me up.  Embarassing!  Then I ended up messing up my gimp leg at KF again, so not even sure if I can do the demo :(.  I'm on drugs now (ibuprofen around the clock).. hopefully this works!  If anyone wants to check out the demo my KF studio is putting on.. it's tomorrow at 1pm at the Sunflower Festival (St. Clair West & Dufferin'ish).  If i'm there, you can see me scream & shout and beat up my partner ;).

       growing up..   I took my grandma to the local shoppers drug mart yesterday to buy a new glucometer and ran into a classmate there.  Found out she owns that store now and is also getting married in 2 months.  She looked so happy and really I was happy for her.  But at the same time, it still bugged me.. my lack of grown-up'ness.  She asked what was going on in my life and in my head I thought.. hmm.. planning a vacation for later this year, KF demo this weekend.. and oh, right, summerlicious.. must make out a list of restaurants I want to try.  Yeh, exciting stuff huh?  Last week I was in the change room at KF and there was this woman and her 7yo daughter there.  Her daughter was watching me for a few minutes then whispers something to her mom.  She couldn't make out what she was saying, so her daughter says again, a little bit louder this time, "Mommy, I'm almost as big as that girl".  Her mom then went on to explain that people come in different sizes and not everyone grows up to be big.

      I'm post Relay for Life today, but I'm not doing too bad considering.  I was home by 7:45am, showered and in bed by 8:20am, then slept for about 5 hours.  Several people have asked by I chose to do a 12 hour overnight relay for the Canadian Cancer Society rather than a 2 hour run or something instead.  Well for one, I suck at running.  Secondly, there's just something appealing about setting up tents and spending the night with your team and hundreds of other strangers all sharing a common purpose of providing hope and support for this ugly disease.  It's pretty undescribable the feeling that comes over you as you watch the sun set and rise while doing laps around the track lit up by candles.  The night actually went by quickly as we took turns on the track and hanging out at our tents snacking and playing board games.  Thanks again Team Shanti for the beautiful evening.  Starting to fade a bit now.. so time for more sleep.     ... sunset at the campground     ... the track at 5am, lit up by the luminaries dedicated to cancer survivors and victims

      There's this one girl at KF who just rubs me the wrong way.  It's her attitude, her witchy laugh, her need for attention, and the way she treats others.  Last night during class, she kept yelling out to me "c'mon you can do better than that for a blue belt".  For one of the very few times during the past 2 years, I stopped having fun at KF and just wanted to get out.  Even after sleeping on it, I'm still agitated this morning.  Two things I just cannot tolerate are disrespect and rudeness.

      Last night was so much fun!   urlLink Vecchio Frak  is one pretty cool place.  The food was so yummie and they had the funkiest drinks.  Hmmm…  also can’t forget the cute waiter.  Eye candy is always good.  :)  I don’t hang out in little Italy much after my disastrous birthday dinner at Coco Lezzone, but I’d definitely go back to VF.  Gus’ band is planning to play there again later this summer (they sounded great as always last night) and Saturdays they have a DJ spinning some house.  Tempting eh?.. stay tuned for details!   Happy’s long weekend!  Oh hee.. today was kinda funny.. I showed up to physio wearing some tall wedgie sandals and they made me go work on the exercise bike!  oops.

      Miscellaneous rants… no flow or common theme here.&nbsp; Just one of those jumbled thoughts days.   … 1st physio session yesterday, started with her massaging my leg for the 1st 15min.&nbsp; I thought, hey, I think I’m gonna like this physio thing.&nbsp; (I know I’m sure it’ll get more intense after).&nbsp; Then I just got hooked up to the electrical machine to strengthen my wimpy quad.   … I’m starting to get worried about my Gung-gung.&nbsp; He’s been doing so well after his stroke.. didn’t really have any residual neurological deficits and he has good short- and long-term memory.&nbsp; But the other day, I thought he was in his room sleeping when I heard talking.&nbsp; So I went to investigate and he was talking to himself.&nbsp; But he was obviously having a conversation with someone and he was speaking coherently, not like when you talk jibberish in your sleep.&nbsp; I listened for a bit outside his door then he goes, I don’t want to talk to you anymore, and hits his head a few times and he goes quiet.&nbsp; A little later in the day, I asked him who he was talking to earlier and he denied it... then smiled and kinda chuckled to himself.   … really must learn how to parallel park.&nbsp;   … I’m so lovin the amazing race right now.&nbsp; That would be the one reality tv show I’d love to do.&nbsp; I’d need a guy to be my partner tho just in case we had to eat icky things.&nbsp; Or hehee.. Christine and I could always be the “Asian Flowers” duo.&nbsp; We seem to have that lost and confused look down pat, judging by how people kept coming to help us with directions in Greece.&nbsp;   … having a bit of baby fever right now.&nbsp; There’s this incredibly cute but cranky Chinese baby boy in the nursery.&nbsp; I so just wanna pick him up and play.   … my jasmine plant is dying.&nbsp; She’s now under the care of my mom who’s spritzing everyday and trying to revive her.&nbsp; No greenthumb for me.   … had a lesson with a cute boy at KF.&nbsp; He punched me in the breast… it was a light punch, but still embarrassing.&nbsp; Things happen, I guess… can’t be as bad as them getting accidentally kicked in the balls.   … looking forward to the long weekend.&nbsp; Tonight we’re getting another dose of Gus and his band.&nbsp; Tomorrow’s plans to go dancing at the Garage416 party at Sunnyside for my friend’s birthday got cancelled.&nbsp; It’s too bad cuz I was looking forward to seeing him (don’t you love it how some guys just disappear once they start dating someone?!) and to hearing some good house music.&nbsp; Saturday, it’s BBQ time with the girls.&nbsp; Yum yum.&nbsp; Hari’s band is playing Saturday night too.. oh wells.&nbsp; Guess I’ll just catch his next gig.&nbsp; Hee.. I’m such a groupie.   All ranted out now :)

      Yesterdays was a super day for heading to the beaches jazz fest weather wise.. as I’m sure the super sized crowds also thought.  We went early to have some dinner.. ended up at the Thai House.  Had to wait for a table but it was definitely worth it… “Drunken noodles” and panang beef curry.  Very yummie.  Still think I’m partial to the panang curry at Salad King tho.  Watched Gus’s band play a couple songs.. didn’t stay too long at his corner since we’ll be going to his show this Thursday anyways.  I almost bought a CD from this guitarist.. hmmm’s.. can’t remember his name already.  I think it was Ray Montford or something like that.  I really enjoyed one of his songs where he sang too.. kinda had the eerie calmness of a Radiohead song.  But then we listened more and he started to get a bit too psychedelic with his playing for my liking.  I would have to say the highlight of the night was ice cream!!  We stopped by Ed’s Real Scoop and I even spoke with Ed myself while he was making a batch of ice cream.  He gave me the funniest look when I asked if he put eggs in the ice cream like I was nutso or something.  Yeah no eggs.  I’ll just have to say Ben & Jerry’s suck.  Ed’s homemade ice cream was so good.. right up there with Greg’s Ice Cream.    We sat inside while we ate our ice cream since it was starting to get a bit chilly outside and talked about the merits of what else… boys!  My friend just cracks me up.  She’s dating about 5 guys at the moment and the numbers just seem to keep multiplying.  She also mentioned that she was on Lava Life and so was her ex-bf and some other people she knew.  She was trying to convince me to give it a try.  Hmm.. I think I’m just close-minded, but I always thought this on-line dating stuff would have a lot of desperate or weird people on em.  But my friend and her ex are fun, attractive, intelligent professionals.  Who knows, maybe I’ll give it a shot sometime seeing as lately I only seem to attract either young boys or flirty married guys.  Oh right and then there’s my neighbour who’s mother is ready to have us married any day now.  Yah right.

      Surgery scares me.&nbsp; The longest time I’ve ever been a patient at a hospital, besides when I was born, was when I had a migraine headache during a math test in grade 12.&nbsp; They hooked me up to some IV drugs, I slept for 4 hours, then I went home.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I had my physiotherapy assessment today.&nbsp; She’s pretty sure my ACL is 100% torn, along with some damage to my meniscus & collateral ligament… what they call the “unhappy triad”.&nbsp; It’s silly… before meeting the surgeon, I was pretty gung-ho about getting it done.&nbsp; Then he said let’s wait and see and I was happy cuz I felt relieved and maybe a bit hopeful that I could heal without surgery.&nbsp; But now my physio said I should think hard about surgery because I’d likely need it if I wanted to return to a similar level of physical activity.&nbsp; And now I’m bummed again… jolted back to reality.   My hamstrings are constantly contracting right now trying to hold my tibia in place and that’s what’s causing my pain and my leg to be bent.&nbsp; Physio will help to straighten out my leg and calm my hamstrings down, but that’s about it.&nbsp; I didn’t understand why surgery would so painful.. thinking they just cut a few holes to manipulate in the joint space… but I didn’t know they drilled into bone!!&nbsp; No wonder you&nbsp;need morphine.&nbsp; Nine months for rehab post surgery&nbsp;to heal too.&nbsp; Sucks eh.

      I bought a plant!!&nbsp; You know... I was getting kinda jealous, Mae has Ju-Jube and now KNC has her new testes plant (an orchid)… I wanted someone to care for too.&nbsp; I’ve loved jasmine plants ever since a coworker brought some flowers into work one day and have been eyeing them at the Asian flower shop on Baldwin for awhile now.&nbsp; They just smell soooo good... reminds of bubbleT.&nbsp; I’ll post some photos of Jazzy after she gets all settled at home.

      A year ago we were mapping out our Greece intinerary.. trying to decipher all those ferry schedules and deciding just how many pairs of shoes we could fit in our packs, and now i've got that travel itch again.  Every year since school, i've gone away somewhere.. Europe, Spain&Portugal, Mexico, Greece.  Well partly due to the gimp and some poor planning on my part, it looks like my destination this year will be Thunder Bay!  woo hoo!  Really tho, I'm actually looking forward to it since I haven't been back for a few years now.  It's just too bad it's in October, so JenK, you won't be around to show me the new hotspot in town ;).    Just thinking about it even brings back a lot of memories.  Can't wait.  I'm coming home.

      There’s usually about 5-10 people working in the pharmacy at any given time, so out of respect for each other’s musical preferences, we always put the radio on to some generic radio station (i.e. Mix 99.9, CHUM FM).  I’m tired and cranky today after working for 10 days straight, so I took the plunge and put a CD on.  Need some feel good music.  It’s pretty funny how my productivity increases by so much with some good tunes (and haven’t heard any complaints yet from the others!)  Check em out…   urlLink Tortured Soul .  mmm.. infectious stuff.

      When I was 7... he was the boy down the street who’d play marbles and climb the monkey bars with me in the summer and build forts and throw snowballs in the winter.  Our only concern in the world was how fast we could make it to the playground.    When I was 13… he was the boy in high school who always looked so cool hanging out at the mall on the weekend.  Why are Grade 8 boys so boring and un-cool?  When I was 15… he was the boy who owned a skateboard.  He had floppy hair, listened to loud angry music, loved plaid shirts, and wore pants that were 10 sizes too large.    When I was 17… he was the scruffy boy who wore toques, big woolly sweaters, Sierra design and Fimo beads.  Outdoor rec was his dream.  When I was 19… he was the boy who drove a rice rocket and only wore different shades of grey and black.  His life revolved around bball, snooker, karaoke and bubbleT.  Can’t believe cute Asian boys exist… life in Toronto is alright.  When I was 24… he was the boy with bleached blonde hair, played guitar, and was man enough to wear the colour orange.  Just can’t get over the small-town girl in me.    I’m 27 now… and he is the boy who’s confident and funny.  He likes to have fun but still manages to get up the next day for work.  He’s adventurous but could also stay home for a good game of Scrabble.  Hmm... didn’t really notice what he’s wearing, but he has good hygiene.  Respect, compassion and trust are words that actually mean something to him.  Most of all, he knows how to put that smile on my face and makes me feel safe.

      Questions about braces..  1)  Do they ever stop rubbing the inside of your mouth or am I going to be lovin the wax for the next 18 months?  2)  Is there a special way to eat so that 1/2 your meal doesn't get stuck in the back of your mouth?  3)  Can you kiss normally?

      hmm.. started to blog and not really in the mood anymore.  to keep this short.. no surgery right now.  he's putting me on a rehab program for 6 weeks to strengthen up my muscles.  apparently i'm still gimpy not because of my ACL but because my hamstrings have tightened up.  need to suck up the pain and try to get it normal again.

      knee appt with the surgeon at 6:30 tonight.. starting to get a bit nervous now.  i'm just hanging out in the hospital waiting and waiting.  i know it's crazy.. in my head i've been thinking about it and surgery is prolly the best option, but for him to actually say that to me and the reality of it happening is scary.

      oy.. the braces are on.  can't say they're very much fun at all.  day 1 was good and i thought it was cuz i had so much naproxen in my system, but the next day when i woke up, it was achy to even brush my teeth.  still on the mushy food diet right now.. congee, yogurt & ice cream.  i always thought i had a pretty big mouth judging by the sushi pieces i can stuff in, but it doesn't feel like everything fits in my mouth now.  hee hee.. i'm getting real good at the pouty look.

      I've never really had a good grasp of what to do with my money (besides spending it on "retail therapy", sushi, KF, travelling.. things I consider personal investments), so I've always thought it'd be a good idea to get to know some finance stuff.  I do save some money now that i'm living at home and invest in GICs, RRSPs, mutual funds etc., but I always wonder if there's more I can do.  So with all this idle time at home this week, I started to read the Prospectus thinking that's a good place to start.  It made me sleepy and felt a bit deja vu of school reading, so I put that aside and took a look at my annual HOOPP (hospitals of ontario pension plan) statement.  It lays out what my estimated monthly benefits would be if I retire at age 55, 60, or 65.  I told my mom that retirement at age 55 sounds very tempting and her reply was that well, I'd better get married and have kids soon then if I want them to be self sufficient by the time I retire.  hmm.. good point.  Estimated date of retirement:  Dec 01, 2031

      Taste of the Danforth was fun last night.. but it sure takes some skill trying to eat your food while squeezing your way through the massive crowds.  I wasn't sure if I was ready for Greek food again after last year's trip and eating gyros or souvlaki every single night, but I managed to eat.. quite a lot actually (1 skewer of pork, 1 skewer of grilled octopus, 1/2 roasted yam, 2 salmon maki).  Sunday already.. back to the grind tomorrow.  It really hasn't felt like summer this year yet.. not sure why.  And Sept is quietly creeping up.  I miss those days where summer seemed to last forever, as Bryan Adams puts it.  It's strange cuz there's still 24 hrs a day but it just feels like it's going by so much faster now.  This hasn't been a good summer for me either.  My mood is just everywhere.. some days i'm bouncing off the walls, other days I just can't shake the funk.  I'm trying to suck it up, but I can't stop thinking about all the things I could be doing without the gimp knee (i.e. last night, they were selling belly dancing skirts on the Danforth.. the ones that jingle.. and I so wished I could take more classes).  Then it's like a downward spiral, I get sad, then I start thinking about other things that make me even more sad... like things I don't have in my life and friends I haven't seen lately who's company I miss.  But I think i'm ready to get on with it now and stop this moping.  Let me focus on the things I do have and the things I can still do.. like taking a cooking course and enjoying the company of people who are still around and care.  I can do this.

      I called help desk today cuz our printer at work was acting up.  Computer dude asks if I've tried turning the power off and on.  Nope.  Usually that is my first fix for anything electronic that has gone wonky (ie.  our fiesty old DVD player.. I've gone so far as to unplug the thing.. and it always revives itself).  But I thought the help desk would have a more computer-y intelligent way of fixing the problem.  So I try it.  Printer works just fine now.

      I saw something in the paper today about the new Tamagotchi, supposedly better than before. Yeh, I remember my old Tamagotchi... my poor, poor Tamagotchi. Only takes three words to describe my Tamagotchi experience... failure to thrive. I'd put him in my pocket or bag and forget to feed or play with him.   Then I discovered the magic of the ...  reset  button!

      Once upon a time, I had a friend who started to become more than a friend.  We were both feeling it at the time, then he had a change of heart and we went back to being friends.  And we’re cool now.  I haven’t seen him in almost a year, but really, we’re good.  Now, I have another friend who’s still just a friend.  But he’s a great guy.  And we have fun together.  The things he says and his emails and goofy actions always have a way of making me smile.  And he has characteristics which I admire… which is obviously why he’s my friend.  I really didn’t think much of things until several people asked me if we were dating or why I didn’t go for him.  And I started to think about it, about him.  Maybe it could work.  Maybe it would be better if we just stayed friends.  The last thing I want to do is to weird him out by making a move.  I’d miss having him as my friend.  But could I be missing out on something more by staying silent?
