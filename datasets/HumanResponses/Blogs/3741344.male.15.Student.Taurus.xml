      Today I went to the mall and had my ear peirced. I know... stupid, but whatever. I've always wanted it, and my parents were cool about it, so why not? If I get tired of it, i'll just take it out. But yeah, the mall was pretty cool... Now i'm going to get naked and play Cube. Peace.

      Holy crap i'm bored. I've done nothing but sit around all damn day, and now i'm f*cking bored. I guess it   could be worse.. I could of had to work today. At least it gave me time to re-listen to all my Paul Van Dyk albums though.. btw, i'm still bored. Anyway, today i decided to mess with the game called Cube, and mess with the HUD to make my weopons look different and such, and it came out pretty cool. But yeah, peace out.

      Well, I finally did it. Now not only do I have Halo for Xbox, but now I have it for PC, too. It's alright, though.. it's such a good game, I don't mind giving money to Bungie. Anyway, the one for PC is GREAT for those who can't get Xbox live..   and hell, it even has new weaopons and maps that everyone will love. But me, well.. I like to stick to good old Blood Gulch :D.

      Fireworks. Independence day? Nah. I'm not doing it for that. I'm doing it because it's the one night that there are fuckloads of drunk people lighting shit on fire, and I think it's cool. Only thing i'm pissed off about is this 'safe and sane' california shit. I don't want pretty fireworks... I want to blow shit up. Sure, i'll buy sparklers.. but only to use them to light off m150s. What's cooler then blowing a hole in the side of somone's trashcan? Nothing. All fireworks should be legal. A fountain in an idiot's hand is just as bad as an m80 in anyone's hand. I think it's bullshit.. I want to blow shit up.

      I'm sick of windows. I'm getting linux in the next month or so. I will, however, have to keep windows on another harddrive for all the stuff i have that doesn't work with linux. It's all good though.. Anyway, Recently I downloaded CoLinux, wich is linux that runs in windows.. and it gave me an idea on how to use it (kind of) and just how much better it is then windows. So yeah, peace.
