       Memorial Day Weekend. I love 3 day weekends! Well, who doesn't. I got a lot done this weekend. My friends Cindy and Al bought me a new computer desk and shelf for my birthday. I ended up gutting my room and rearranging everything. It's quite nice. It needed to be cleaned desperately. I also went out and bought a matching TV stand to replace the rickety stand that I had. It looks a million times nicer. It even seems a little bit rommier in here (which is totally an optical illusion since this room is too small for Malibu Barbie). Anyway, I really feel like I accomplished something.

       Well, today was my 34th birthday. It was a good day...no one forgot. Last Sunday, I had a birthday party with my friends and got some nice gifts. Tonight, I had dinner with some friends at Carrabba's. The food was excellent and I had a great time. Normally, I don't think I feel older on my birthday -- well, except maybe 31 -- but I do feel a little older today. I don't know if that's good or bad. Hmm.

       I added a "viewer rating" voting feature to my "Will & Grace" web site. It's pretty cool. I noticed that there is some abuse though. I guess I'll have to add IP tracking and if someone revotes on an episode, then it just changes their current vote. I had hoped not to do that....

       How awesome were the Must See TV finales last night?! "Friends" and "Will & Grace" were just great. I can't wait until next season.

       I received an award today at work... Supply Chain Excellence Award for 1st Quarter 2003, from the Avon Glenview facility. I was very surprised. It was a nice moment.... I think I'll take my coworkers to lunch tomorrow.... (Just looked at the menu for tomorrow, baked pork chop. Yuck. Definitely going out.)

       Due to increasing bandwidth and storage requirements, my entire website will be moving to another server in the very near future. I also have a completely new design for the main page. I haven't touched the current page in years and it looks like crap.  I'll still be with the same web host,  urlLink Interland , just on a newer, faster server. It should be a seamless transistion, but let  urlLink me  know if you find any broken links or images.

       Well, today was a fun packed day. I went to see  Finding Nemo  with Cindy and Al and Alex. It was a great movie, very funny, and very cute. Ellen DeGeneres is a riot. It was much more enjoyable than  Matrix Reloaded . After that, I went ATVing with Al and Cindy. Now, that was something different. It was kind of scary, but at the same time really fun! I think Al was trying to kill me. I'm wore out. Time for bed....

       I went to see  The Matrix Reloaded  tonight. It was good, not great, but good. I don't really get why people get so worked up about  The Matrix . Sure, the special effects are good, but how many slow-motion fight scenes can they pack into a movie? Apparently, not enough. But, who am I to say; I'm a Star Wars and Star Trek geek!

       I spent the day in Macon with my boyfriend yesterday. We had a really good time just hanging out and talking and laughing. I really love him.   All of my friends are out of town and today I was kind of bored, so I decided to go to the movies. I saw  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen . It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. On Friday, I saw  28 Days Later . It was ok, but not great. It wasn't really all that scary; you didn't feel any real threat from the zombies. It started out kind of interesting, but then just got stupid at the point they got to the blockade.

       I saw two movies this weekend:  The Order  and  Dickie Roberts: Child Star . They were ok. Pickings were kind of slim.  The Order  was good, it was kind of wierd, and not really what I was expecting.  Dickie  had some very funny moments in it, and was actually more enjoyable that I thought it would be.  There was a trailer for  Alien: The Director's Cut  before  The Order . I am  dying  to see that. I wasn't even aware that they were preparing a re-release of the original  Alien  movie. It is going to be AWESOME.

       GEEK ALERT! I bought one of the Abacus SPOT watches yesterday. It is really cool. It receives data over FM radio band from MSNDirect. The watch is a little big, and a little geeky looking. The screen is very easy to read. I usually keep it on the "Glance" channel ... it scrolls the news, weather, stock quotes. You can configure what you want to see using the direct.msn.com web site. You can also download an Outlook add-on that syncronized your calender. The watch will then display a message and play a little tune before your appointments. Fun!

       Well, I moved all my stuff into my new apartment. I can't believe how fast we moved my stuff! I had everything packed up and in the garage. We had to take apart the bed, and move the bedroom furniture. We finished in less than two hours. It was amazing. All of my friends were very impressed with my packing! Of course, it will take forever to get everything put away....

We also saw the Blond Ambition World Tour back in 1990 in Detroit with some of our frends from college. I can't believe how long ago that was....

       Cindy and Al finally broke up. She's not taking it too well, but in the long run she knows she did the right thing. I think so too. We got to hang out a little bit this weekend. She always has to work at her night job, though. (She teaches Pre-K and works at a restaurant part time). I feel really bad that we don't get to spend more time together. Hopefully this summer will be better, since she won't have school and will be able to get some stuff done around her house.

       I had my birthday celebration with my friends today. We went out to eat and then everyone came over for cake and presents. I had the best time. It was so nice that everyone came over and we got to hang out together for a while. Doug's friends Warren and Brian also came from Savannah. It was nice to finally meet Brian. I was so happy that he and Warren could come. It was nice that they got a long with all of my friends as well. And I got some great gifts, of course! While I was out to see  Mean Girls  with Cindy, Doug decorated the apartment with banners and balloons. But I cannot believe that he ruined that gorgeous cake with a 3 and a 5 candle!  I'd like to give a  shout out  to: Doug, Cindy, Todd, Jody, Edie, Holly, Al, Warren, Brian, Anna, Riley, Sam and Alex.

       Unfortunately for me, my 2-year old iPod just died. It wouldn't get past the Apple logo. Fortunately, I bought an extended warranty from CompUSA when I bought it. I took it back and they gave me a brand new one, a new model with twice as much space! The new iPods are really slick. I love the dock. It takes a little getting used to the buttons being slightly different, but overall I can't complain. With the new iPod, I finally installed iTunes software. It's not all that. I'm not sure what the big deal is, not counting the on-line store feature. Anyways.... Get one if you can. You won't regret it.

       I can't believe it. "Friends" is over. Yes, Cindy, Doug, Todd, Holly, and myself were part of that 51 million who tuned in for the end of an era. I'm sure I'll still catch it in reruns from time to time, but it won't be the same. Must See TV just won't be the same without "Friends" and with "The Apprentice" moving in. Luckily "Will & Grace" and "ER" will still be around.  "I'll be there for you...'cause you're there for me too...."
