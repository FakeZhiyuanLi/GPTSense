      This is intense ever since I came to college. Never would have thought it would be this hard. Back when I was in Highschool, I really loved math! I don't know what happened. They just teach very fast in college. Not the usual thing I'm used to. So, wether people liked math or so, I'll find a waay or another to delete math out of my life. Although I know I'm going to need it in the future anyway!

      Whoa! I really had no idea that college would be this difficult. I mean, maybe I'm still in the point of being culture shocked! Highschool is  way  different from college I tell you. Just don't know why it had to be very difficult you know. Anyway, that's how life works...never made it easy for anyone does it?

       Speech Communication  is a  GE  course of mine..and one of my favored subjects as well as hated..  I love it because of our  teacher..Mr. Elmer Rufo..a gay..and a funny man..I mean..woman..as he would like to be. He's directing a play called Antigone. Never heard of it's story but we are obliged to watch it..since it's essential part is a review of the play..nice prof..  I hate it on the other hand..because...of my classmates. They're kind of different from the other classmates I have in other subjects. It seems very hard to go and have a bond with them. They seem the hard type of people to get along with. But hey...there's nothing I can do anyway..so I'll just live it like that..

      Wow..I really missed posting..although as you can see..I have only about less than three posts yet..anyway..I've got loads to tell you since my long absence..  I feel good about our Midterm Examination in Math 17 or the so-called Departmental Exam..Yup..I feel good about it..and I think I have 67% of passing? I really need to pass it though..I've already failed two consecutive long exams..both of which is 80 pts and has a 10% equivalence in our grade..  But anyway..the good news about it all is that I passed our Long Exam in Philosophy 1..and I'm happy about it! 'Coz I never really got the chance to review that..and then I passed..  Hey..visit our section's site during highschool..I made it..It's not much..but hey..we've got a site!
