       Unlike most folks I know, I read articles in papers from England, Scotland, Australia, just about anywhere. I enjoy them because they're not Republican; they're not Democrat. They're just journalism. Or something!   Do they have an agenda? Probably. But it's not an especially American political agenda, which is why they're so great. Like the 17-year cicadas swarming outside in my trees, they are pretty oblivious to American opinion on the war. They can "get away with" saying things that the major press here just can't. ("Freedom of the Press"? More like "American groupthink").     Articles from the international press that must have Michael Moore salivating:    urlLink The trail to Tehran . This British article seems pretty credible, despite its lack of "objective" tone. The connections between Chalabi and Iran and the concerns that Iran provided Chalabi with the inaccurate intelligence that brought the U.S. into the Iraq war are certainly worth following up on.   urlLink Who killed Nick Berg?  Okay, True Confessions time. I  love  conspiracy theories! It doesn't matter whether I believe them or not. And the Nick Berg case does have enough plot holes to wake up the inner conspiracy theorist in just about anyone who is not tied down by the notion that U.S. black ops. would never pull such a thing. At any rate, it's fun to see what the Aussies can print on the war. No major American paper would ever be allowed to print such a thing... true or not true.   Speaking of which... I read somewhere that one of the figures in the Nick Berg video was wearing a golden ring, and that such an adornment would be forbidden among radical Muslims. I'm not asking anybody to go out and watch the video, I'm just interested in the claim about the gold ring. Is it true that Muslims aren't supposed to wear gold or gold rings? Is that in the teachings of Muhammed?   Some articles from the  non-major  American press:    urlLink For Shame . This article certainly repudiates the notion (voiced by people like Rush Limbaugh) that all the "hand-wringing" over the torture scandal is inspired by liberals.    urlLink Gen. Zinni: 'It's Unpatriotic Not To Question' the Iraqi Fiasco . From my hometown paper, Falls Church News Press!!! I was attracted to this article because of the headline. (General Zinni formerly commanded U.S. troops in the Middle East... after Schwarzkopf and before Tommy Franks). Unfortunately, you don't get his comments till the latter part of the article. But still... You don't normally think of getting this type of reporting in a freebie local paper for a fairly small city. But Falls Church, Virginia is only 9 miles away from Washington DC, so politics and war policy are a part of our local intellectual playground.  Enjoy!

      Okay, so I'm not just the Prophetess of Doom. Gotta say that there  is  hope for America. After all, we just voted Fantasia Barrino our American Idol!!! So it looks like we haven't  completely  lost our minds!  For weeks, I was wondering.   I'd see lesser talents move forward, as better singers (Amy Adams, Jennifer Hudson, and ultimately La Toya London!!!) got the boot. I was reading the American Idol boards, shocked at the hatred and vituperation I was seeing spewed there against the black contestants.... who, this year, just happened to be the most talented singers in the competition. It was pretty shocking to see George's bounce called "the jigaboo bounce." (Anybody who doubts the depth of racism in this year's contest needs only to have read the official forum on the AI website).  But I remained somewhat optimistic that, as the numbers dwindled, the strongest singers would remain. It didn't quite happen, as I realized when La Toya left the show, but Diana De Garmo was in my Top 3 of the 5 final contestants (along with La Toya and, of course, Fantasia), so in the end we did get a good finale. Fantasia outclassed Diana by a landslide, but Diana put up a good fight nonetheless.  Then there was that vote. I had read the teenybopper posts, lamenting the boot for JPL and John Stevens, and I knew that Diana had inherited those boys' votes. I also knew that some bizarros were holding up Diana (much to her embarrassment, I'm sure) as some "Great White Hope." So, regardless of the performances on Tuesday night, I had no idea how the votes would actually go.  In the end, though, the most promising American Idol won.  Okay, yeah, I was kind of more a La Toya fan, but I also voted for Fantasia each week. And after she sang "Summertime" on Movie Night, I had no idea which way I would swing in the end if the finale came down to La Toya vs. Fantasia. La Toya I thought was the better singer, but Fantasia I thought had the greater musical mind. (That is, Fantasia was the musical genius, who could keep on reinventing songs). I've also got to admit that before Jennifer got the boot, I really wasn't sure how I would go in a vote between the 3 Divas in the Top 3. But it didn't happen.  Anyway, I had decided weeks ago that I would definitely buy Fantasia's CD, because I thought it would be musically interesting. I would buy La Toya's more to support her career. In fact, when it came down to those two in the bottom 2 a few weeks ago, I said to my husband during the commercial break: "You know, I hate to say this, but I'm almost hoping that La Toya's the one who goes. She's gonna be fine. She'll definitely get signed. But she's too much like the two High School girls (just a whole lot better!!!). Fantasia is the one who's different. She's got the best chance of standing out against Diana and Jasmine. So I guess I prefer Fantasia to move on, since one of the Divas has to go tonight."  So I guess in the end, even though I tended to think of La Toya as my American Idol, my real American Idol was Fantasia all along. But I'm still gonna buy La Toya's album.  Okay. I did it. I'm  not  all serious all the time. Gotta have some enjoyment and fun in the blog. Yes, it's true. I'm a fan of  American Idol . And I can hardly wait for Fantasia's music to hit the shelves!!!

       The following was written in early May 2004, shortly after the torture scandal broke, and only a few days before my nightmare-conversation with M...   A year ago, when I read that our soldiers were breaking into houses when women--but no men--were home, I knew the hatred that would result. I knew that Fallujah, or something like it, would happen. But I never suspected that we would torture Iraqis. Why? Because we have been taught all our lives that "Americans just don't do that."   Now we know that that is false.   The scariest part of all this for me is that there is a vocal minority in this country proclaiming that the torture is no big deal... that it may, in fact, be necessary in order to "extract information" from the people who oppose our presence in Iraq. That notion is utterly repugnant to me, and it frightens me.   At this very moment, America is fighting for its soul. Do we go the way of the Romans--living only for spectacle and sensation--and become a nation of Caligulas? Or do we reel from the shock and horror of the images we've seen, oust the parties responsible, and implement a solid plan to insure that the torture does not continue?    When I see the sexual humiliation of the prisoners, when I see our soldiers’ glee at all the degradation, when I hear about the rape, the sodomizing, the beating of prisoners, when I see that leash in the hand of that West Virginia girl, and when I read all this excused by “information extraction experts” as part of a strategy for breaking prisoners down… then I know that our country is taking the road to Caligula. We're not quite there yet. Too many people are truly repulsed by the torture. But we are on our way.    Our soldiers have become savages. Our government has no clue that they have already lost ANY chance of "winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people" and that the only possible result of extending the occupation would be the oppression of Iraqis, the futile deaths of Americans and Iraqis, an ever-increasing hatred and brutality on both sides, and--ultimately--an international jihad against America that America cannot "win."   I was horrified when--without any evidence at all--my government started trying to pin 9/11, and then the anthrax scare, on Iraq because I knew then that they were willing to create any excuse, and invent any evidence they desired, in order to enable them to have an "adventure" in Iraq.    We are ignorant. We know nothing about the Middle East. Entire "invincible" armies have disappeared into the Iraqi landscape. But we pretend that our military power is enough to sustain us.... and that everybody else wants their country to be just like ours. Such arrogance the Greeks once called "hubris." And I am afraid that the end result for my country will be the same end result that the hubristic protagonists of the Greek tragedies suffered... utter destruction.   I am certain that when we have debased our consciences sufficiently to argue collectively for such torture, God will turn us over completely to our “enemies.” But our true enemy will be what we have allowed ourselves to become... the antithesis of America.

      A couple of weeks ago, I had a lunchtime conversation with my good friend, MM. This is a loving, compassionate Christian man who believes strongly in grace. This is someone who has been there for me when I was at my lowest point. But when the subject of the Abu Ghraib torture scandal came up, he became a person I didn't even know he had inside him.  This new stranger was telling me that he couldn't be bothered worrying about the prison torture because, after all, "those people" were shooting at American soldiers. He also informed me that for the President to apologize to the Muslim world was ridiculous because "they" don't apologize for what "they" do to "our" people.  Well, let's put aside for a moment the fact that the "they" he was talking about are terrorists, rather than the legitimate governing body of a nation that proclaims a commitment to justice, democracy, and freedom. And let's put aside for a moment the fact that--according to U.S. Army Intel sources--70-90% of the people inside the prisons in Iraq are innocent folks who got rounded up because the soldiers needed to have something to show for their raids.   Let's put  all  that aside and consider for a moment the central issue:   American soldiers not only played the psychological torture games that we've seen in the photographs, but also savagely beat, raped, and sodomized prisoners. There are stories of soldiers riding prisoners like animals, including one very reliable report of an incident involving a frail 70 year old woman whom soldiers rode "like a donkey." Worse yet, according to the Army's own investigation (as stated in the Taguba Report), this bestial savagery was committed at the behest of military intelligence, the CIA, and civilian contractors. Not exactly the work of a "few bad apples."  In the America I grew up in, there was no place for torture... under  any  circumstances. Even if  all  the people in the Iraqi prisons had been shooting at American soldiers, we would have had an obligation to behave like human beings, not animals. In fact, one assumes that in war, people on the opposing side  will  be shooting at us, which is why safeguards exist for the treatment of Prisoners of War.   Oh, the war is over, so these people are just criminals? Well, who decided that the war was over? Obviously not the Iraqi resistance. It's their terrain. They're the ones who get to decide when to end the hostilities. That's just one of those quaint little conventions of war which I imagine--like the Geneva Conventions--the current Administration believes is outmoded.    (A little aside here... Did King George III declare the war with the colonials over before the colonials decided to stop fighting? Or did he even consider the American rebellion a war? Methinks he thought it treason, not war. But he was wrong, and his country ended up on the losing end of that one.)   Okay, back to the Geneva Conventions... When I was a kid, I heard about American POWs being tortured by the Viet Cong. I have since learned that apparently the reason the Viet Cong considered it okay to torture American soldiers was that America had never declared war, so  technically  the Americans were not "Prisoners of War" and were therefore (according to the Viet Cong) not covered under the Geneva Conventions. It is doubly ironic that today, the U.S. is using a similar semantic argument to deprive POWs of their Geneva Convention rights. Amazing, isn't it, the semantics games people play in order to allow their inner monster to get its freak on?   So anyway, my conversation with M was when the keening began. I cried all the way home. It was like I had suddenly woken up in some weird nightmare where America had become an apologist for brutality and oppression. I had never known, never suspected, never  wanted  to know that this person I so dearly loved, respected, and looked up to had such a hideous monster lurking inside him.   I suppose I should not have been surprised because I've got a hideous monster lurking inside me too. That's part of being human. But M's monster was one that I had never wanted to meet. Now I have. And now I get to learn how to relate with a person who has much more darkness in him than I had ever seen before. But hey, he's done it for me. I guess that's friendship.  At any rate, what was it that 9/11 did to us? It seems to have turned us into a pack of rabid wolves. Maybe Osama's point was to turn us into "them." If it was, then preliminary findings indicate that he may have partially achieved his objective.

      I know, kind of presumptuous, isn't it, to label myself "Cassandra"?   Back in college, I was the doom and gloom girl, proclaiming that we had built our castle out of sand and that it would someday fall. It's been a long time. Nearly 26 years. But now I think I'm seeing it happen, and I don't think I can keep quiet.  I guess for me, part of the reason I'm writing this is that I'm a Christian... yeah, the theologically conservative kind. I find myself really out of step, though, with other Christians concerning the state of the world. Everywhere I look, people are all bright and cheery and optimistic, thinking that all we have to do is send the troops into the Middle East and everything will turn out rosey for the United States. We'll make the world, as my friend FW so aptly put it, "safe for Ken and Barbie to procreate."  Me? I say, "Don't count on it." You can throw all the military might you want at the Muslim world, and the end result will be a mentality of martyrdom. You're not going to overwhelm them militarily into backing down. You'll just create a resistance. The more you crackdown on that resistance, the stronger it will grow. And anyway, they live there. They know the sand, the heat, the terrain. We're the invader, the occupier, the foreigner, the external force that's attempting to tell them what  our  laws are for  their  country.   So I guess I'm wondering what history books--or gee, what current events reports--the Bush Administration failed to read.   And I guess I'm also wondering why I woke up one morning and apparently found myself in the middle of  Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)  with people I love turning into the very monsters they think they're fighting.  That's the only explanation I can think of. And it's not a pleasant thought.
