      All Grown Up: High Time Horrors of Hallway 19 (script) By Segeri  (Scene: Freshman’s classroom. Angelica is reading her report. Mr. Salem and the class listen.)  Angelica: …Nearing the end of World War Two, the Allies led a final…  (Switch to outside the room: the silhouette of Principal Pangborn and another person.)  Angelica, continuing in a muffled voice: …attack on Omaha beach, which ended in— (The principal opens the door slightly and signals to Mr. Salem.)  Mr. Salem: Mr. Pangborn! Sorry, Angelica…class. I’ll just be a minute.  Angelica, crossing her arms in a snobby manner: Hmph!  (Salem steps out to Pangborn. Their shadows are seen through the door’s window. The door muffles their voices. Salem steps in again.)  Mr. Salem: Everyone, we seem to be adding a new member to your class. (He steps aside, and an Asian-looking boy with black hair in a semi-flat top style enters.) His name is Tony Patterson, and he’s a transfer student from…Where are you from again? (Tony whispers to Salem.) Oh? Okay, that’s all right. (to the class…) He seems to be a bit shy on that particular fact. You could ask him later. Now, Tony, please sit… (checks a piece of paper)…behind Miss Pickles over at the fifth row. (Tony nods and goes to the seat)  Angelica: (To herself) Quite the quiet type, isn’t he?  Mr. Salem: OK, Angelica. Please continue.  Angelica: (in a sarcastic tone) Oooh…It’s my turn. (She continues reading her report) As I was saying, the Allies achieved victory at the price of millions of lives. That ended the war in the Western end. On the Eastern end, General Arthur MacArthur, along with another general, took control of Japanese— (Tony suddenly raises his hand.)  Mr. Salem: Yes, Mr. Patterson?  Tony: Um…sir, it’s Douglas MacArthur. There really was an Arthur MacArthur, but he wasn’t a general then. (The class chuckles)  Mr. Salem: Good point, Tony. Angelica, you should get your facts straight next time.  Angelica (RED FACE!): Yes sir… (To herself) I liked him better when he was quiet.  Mr. Salem: Please continue.  Angelica: The American troops took control of Japanese outposts throughout Asia until they defeated the Japanese at Iwo Jima, ending the war… (Tony raises his hand again)  Mr. Salem: Tony?  Tony: Sir…to be exact, the war ended only after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Mr. Salem: Well put, Tony. World War 2 DID end after the devastation of the A-bomb in those areas, Ms. Pickles! Be ashamed of yourself! You had two weeks to make that report, and the new student got even more details right than you did! (The class laughs [poor Angelica!])  Angelica: Sorry, sir…it won’t happen again. (She sits down and stares angrily over her shoulder at Tony, who is taking down notes)(to herself:) You’ll get yours someday, new guy…  Tony: Oh, and sir…there were a lot casualties at the Normandy beaches, but not millions.  Angelica: Ugh…! (slams her head on the table)   (Bell rings.)(Scene: Classroom. The students start leaving for recess. Tony is still packing up his books and Kimi is about to leave. Mr. Salem is still in front.)  Mr. Salem: Excuse me, Kimi? Would you come over for a minute?  Kimi: Yes, sir?  Mr. Salem: Would you mind showing Mr. Patterson around the campus? I’m sure he needs some help going around a new school. And besides, I believe you’re the best person for the job.  Kimi: Sure thing! (she smiles)  Mr. Salem: Thank you, Kimi. (to Tony) Tony?  Tony: (just finished packing his bag.) Sir?  Mr. Salem: Miss Finster, here will show around for the day, if it’s ok with you.  Tony: Thank you sir.  Mr. Salem: Ok then, enjoy your stay here in Jim Jr. (Mr. Salem leaves)  Kimi: Hmm… ok, where do we start? (offering to shake Tony’s hand) The name’s Kimi Watanabe Finster. You could call me Kimi.  Tony: (hesitating) uh… ya… Tony… Tony Patterson.  Kimi: (hand still offered) Come on, why so shy? It’s not like I would bite or anything. (Tony finally shakes her hand) There we go. Come on, let me show you around like I’m supposed to. (They start walking but, there is an awkward silence.) Why so quiet? It’s like you’ve never been with a girl before…  Tony: (chuckles) actually…  Kimi: WHAT?!? Not once?!?  Tony: No, no, no…. it’s not like that. It’s just that, all my life, I’ve studied in exclusive school. I’m not used to co-ed.  Kimi: Really?!? That must have been harsh! (they start walking out.)  Tony: I’m still alive, aren’t I? (smiling)  Kimi: (chuckles a bit) I don’t think you’ll have a problem here. The people here aren’t that bad when you get to know them. Ok... Here’s our first stop. The Science Lab… (end scene 2)  (Scene: school cafeteria. Phil and Lil are arguing while walking with there snacks.)  Phil: NO, I WOULDN’T!!!  Lil: (sarcastic) Oh puh-leez, Philip!!! You wouldn’t last a minute in a real life-threatening situation! You screamed like a little girl at the sight of Bean in the video from a few years back!  Phil: Well, so did you!  Lil: Ehem! I AM a girl!!!  Phil: What about Tommy, Dil, Kimi and Chuckie?!? …Ok… Maybe not Chuckie… But, the others are still guys!!! (They approach a table where Tommy, Chuckie and Dil are sitting.)  Chuckie: (sarcastic) My sister’s a girl, thank you.  Phil: (an embarrassed snicker) He he he… My bad. Speaking of Kimi... (Looking around) Where is she?  Tommy: Haven’t you gotten used to it yet? She’s in the High School now. She’ll most likely be hanging out with her classmates for all we know.  Dil: Don’t you mean “classmate”? (Dil points to Kimi and Tony, still on their tour.)  Lil: Who IS that? I’m not a High School student but, I know guys. I don’t think that guy’s from around here.  Chuckie: Oh no! Not again! Why do many older guys try to touch my sister?!?  Dil: Maybe they’re all from another planet and they see Kimi as a perfect human specimen. Now, they’re trying to abduct her. (Wiggling his fingers)  Tommy: (to Dil) Just for once, Dil, get real. (Back to Chuckie) Let’s just ask her straight… So we won’t have another “Z” incident like last time. (Looks at Chuckie suspiciously)  Chuckie: (In a guilty manner) What?!?  (Kimi sees the others and waves to them and she starts walking towards them. She leaves Tony just standing where he was) Kimi: Hey guys! How’s it going?  Lil: What’s with Tall, Dork and Handsome?  Kimi: Hey! He’s no dork! His name’s Tony. He’s just shy on his first day. That’s all.  Phil: So, he’s a new guy? Let’s give him an honorary 21-Spit salute! He he he…  Kimi: Don’t even think about it…  Tommy: Giving him a tour of school?  Kimi: Yeah. Our teacher gave me the job. (Tony is still standing there.)  Tommy: So, isn’t he supposed to stick to you?  Kimi: OOPS! Be right back. (She goes to get Tony and back to the others.) Sorry about that, Tony. Here are my friends. (She starts introducing them) This is my brother Chuckie, the twins Phil and Lil and Tommy with his brother (Dil is sipping a glass of ketchup with fries)… who is apparently grossing me out more than usual… Dil.   Tony: Nice to meet you. Kimi can’t stop talking about you guys… uh… and girl.  Familiar voice from behind: I’m shocked, Kimi! Aren’t YOU gonna introduce me… (they all look back and see Angelica) your gorgeous and extremely talented classmate.(Angelica sees that it’s Tony)… oh, it’s you…  Kimi :(jokingly) I don’t think that’s necessary… miss MacArthur! (Tony chuckles)  Tony :(offering his hand) You must be the one from history class. You’re Angelica, right? (Angelica looks down at his hand in a snobby manner then gives him the cold shoulder)  Angelica: Sorry, but I’ve got stuff to do. An ace reporter shouldn’t waste time on small talk.  Kimi: Yeah. Like your history report. (Kimi and Tony laugh)  Angelica: Hmph! (She walks away) (to herself) We’ll see who gets the last laugh… (Kimi and Tony turn around and see the others just standing there with a puzzeled look on their faces.)  Kimi: It’s something that happened in class. I’ll tell you guys later.  Tony: Hold it… Ace reporter?  Tommy: Yeah… She works for the school paper.  Tony: (to himself) Hmm… journalism…  Kimi: What’s up?  Tony: It’s nothing really… (The bell rings)  Kimi: Hey guys, let’s just see each other at dismissal.  Lil: See ya! It’s been nice meeting YOU Tony. (She winks at Tony. Phil then nudges her) Hey!  Tommy: Yeah. Same here  Chuckie: (mumbles to himself) I still think he’s up to no good.  Dil: Just tell me if you want some Fries with that. Hehehe…  Tony: Likewise. (end scene 3)  (Scene: it’s dismissal time and almost all of the students are on the way home. Tony is in the hallway looking around. He reaches a door and enters. As it closes, the sign on the door reads: “Newsroom”. He looks around and sees Angelica typing something.)  Tony: uh… excuse me?  Angelica: (She looks up from her computer and says in her usually bossy way…) what is it? ...Oh… It’s you… What do YOU want?  Tony: I was just wondering… is the school paper… you know… accepting new applicants?  Angelica: (in a sarcastic fashion) What if we are?  Tony: I was hoping that I’d like to work in journalism… you know, as a-  Angelica: (interrupts) –reporter? We’ve got more than enough…  Tony: Uh… no… as an illustrator.  Angelica: (puzzled) What?  Tony: You know, a guy for layouts, editorial cartoons, comics and other junk like that.  Angelica: (in a sleezy fashion in a way as if though she found a way to get rid of him) Oooo… Sorry… But, we ALREADY have a graphic designer for th- (Harold barges in, interrupting Angelica.)  Harold: Ma’am! Jean just quit as our layout guy!  Angelica: (shocked) WHAT?!? What happened?!?  Harold: He moved to “Twists” magazine! I tried to stop him! I TRIED!!!  Angelica: What are we gonna do?!? He’s the best artist in school and HE’S at TWISTS?!? Where are we going to look for a guy as good as him?!? (camera focuses on Tony)  Tony: I could do it.  Harold: A friend of yours?  Angelica: ugh… looks like you’ve got yourself a job…  Tony: WOOHOO!!!  Angelica: But, first, you have to do the “hallway E-4-19” test…  Harold: OH NO! Come on! Give the guy a break!  Tony: What’s the “hallway E-4-19” test?  Angelica: All of the reporters have to go through the test in order to prove how far they would go for journalism-  Harold: It’s not even related!  Angelica: (To Harold) Would you just shut up! (back to Tony) Anyway…There’s this abandoned building just east of here. It used to be the high school building a few years ago. You have to go to the 4th floor and look for the 19th hallway. Inside one of the rooms, you should find something with the initials “F.M.” carved in.  Tony: That looks easy enough.  Angelica: You have to look for it starting midnight this Saturday until 8 o’clock, the next day.  Tony: uhh… right… midnight… 8 hours is plenty. (smiles)  Angelica: You wouldn’t be smiling until you’ve heard the story of…  Harold: No! Don’t tell it! Please!!!  Angelica: Then leave! (Harold runs out)  Angelica: ... Wimp… Anyway…Where was I?  Tony: You were about to tell me some story that uhh… you’re uh… friend didn’t want to hear…  Angelica: He’s just an assistant… Ok, About THAT story… There’s this urban legend from a few years ago. A student named Frank Manson used to study here. He was the typical wall flower who never seemed to talk to anyone… or so that’s what everyone thought. Some say he had a bad childhood, others say he was born nuts while some say he was possessed by an evil spirit. Big whoop… The point is, he was a psycho. No one knew about this until it was too late… During a class sleepover, he just snapped and killed every single one of his classmates. He gutted them, decapitated them, dismembered them and did them in through every way imaginable. He had killed everyone except their teacher who witnessed the slaughter. And when I say everyone… I mean, even himself. The next morning, the forensics investigated the scene of the crime. When they entered a room in the 19th hallway, the place you’re gonna go to, they saw Frank’s body with a knife sticking out of his chest. Behind him, written in blood, were words saying, “more will join me.” The next day, they checked Frank’s house and saw his parents… both dead for around 2 weeks already. Now, you have to look for Frank’s murder weapon, his knife which has his initials. It was left at the scene since, according to the police, something tried to stop them from picking it up… or any of the bodies. That’s why the building was abandoned… Rumor has it that he wasn’t dead and he still roams the east wing… in search for “more that would join him.” (She looks back at Tony. He’s just quietly stood there, staring into space.) a little scary for you? You could pull back if you’re not up to it. (Tony regains consciousness.)  Tony: No… I’m taking the test. I want… no… NEED this job! Does the editor of the paper already know this?  Angelica: You’ve been listening to her for the past minute.  Tony: (shocked) Ma’am!  Angelica: (moving back to the PC) Meet you this Saturday at midnight, ok? Now, get outta here! I’ve got work to do.  Tony: Ok, thanks. (he leaves the newsroom)  (end of scene 4)  (Scene: Recess of the next day. Tony is sitting at a cafeteria table, just staring at his food. Kimi walks towards him.)  Kimi: Hey, something wrong? (Tony doesn’t answer) uhh… hello. Tony? (She tries to get his attention.) Yoohoo! HEY! (Tony finally leaves his daze)  Tony: Huh? Oh… hey there… Remember when I asked about Pickles being an ace reporter?  Kimi: uh, yeah. What about it?  Tony: I uh… signed up for the school paper…  Kimi: You did WHAT?!?!  Tony: I went to the newsroom yesterday to sign up. It’s just something I’ve always wanted to do…  Kimi: You must really want that job considering that you’re willing to risk it with Angelica.  Tony: (He says sarcastically.) She’s not that bad, considering her being my boss-to-be.  Kimi: She is?  Tony: Yup… She gave this initiation test where I have to get some dead psycho’s knife.  Kimi: You’re going to HALLWAY 19?!? You’re actually going to get that knife out of old Manson’s corpse?!?  Tony: (sighs) This Saturday, at midnight… (to himself) and I really wanted that job…  Kimi: (thinking of an idea) hmm… did she say that you should go alone?  Tony: No, but, I don’t think… (Kimi smiles) Hey! You’re right!  Kimi: We’ll get you that job in no time. I’ll ask the others if they could help out.  Tony: But, isn’t it out of your way? I mean, it’s MY initiation.  Kimi: And OUR PROBLEM as long as Angelica’s around.  Tony: You seem to be taking this personally…  Kimi: It is. My friends and I have known her since we were babies! And I mean literally!  Tony: No kidding?

      losing one of our own. he has been the part of our family. though he takes no human form, his heart was more human than any one of us. the joy he gave us is irreplaceable. he will be missed.  peewee, our pet shih-tzu, may just be a dog to you, but for us, he was more than that.

      what does it mean to be responsible? am i?  why must i hesitate to do what i am supposed to do? is it all because of my parents absence?... no... that shouldn't be. i have my life and i choose to take the choices a make. maybe it's just my romantic side, day-dreaming once again... taking up all my time and hoping for things that could never happen.   must i also take responsibility for my actions? of course! must i know what they are?... normally... however, my focus sometimes is lost and engulfed by my romantic yet dark side.... i cry for a more exciting life...   i need to keep this other side of me under control. if i don't, it will consume me and i will become the person i am not.

      life's been better for me lately. i've gotten rid of the irrational thoughts of a one-sided relationship, gotten rid of my bad habit of jumping into conclusions and even realized how my brother is more like me than i ever realized. everything that has happened to me has already happened in the past through my brother... as in EXACTLY. for all i know, i'm destined to have face everything that my brother already has.   however, even if i'm done dealing with my relationship problems, another thing came up. questions ring in my head again. am i a responsible person? am i mature already? if not, what must i do to become mature? am i better off without my parents? why am i even typing this?... well, i don't really know what to say. when one problem is done, there's always another one waiting to replace it. kinda like.... oh.... um... shark teeth!... hehe..

      ok... it's definitely a subconscious problem of mine. when i think about it, i'm better off as a friend cause i talk and act REALLY bad when "in love". love is blind, and so is the one who's hit by it. now, my biggest problem is to keep from even mentioning the topic. easier said than done though... the thoughts constantly pound my head... that's when i realized that it only takes conscious effort and never to give in. it would make things better for the both of us. as the agent in sum of all fears said, "this conversation never happened.""what conversation?"

      from love to hate in only a minute... that must be some kind of record. i don't know if i would be able to forgive her anymore... she's given me all the pains of a teenager that i have. that night was the last straw. i must move on with life but with the wounds i have... the scars will be to great to be ignored...

      ok... ang wierd... one minute, i'm confused and googoo-eyes over her... then I'm the life-consultant of her guy-issue the next. it's great that this irrational feeling is almost completely gone... but, now i'm confused about why i do&nbsp;such things... maybe i'm just too overly melodramatic as i said. maybe i look at life to make it like those "telenovelas" unconsciously. it's kind of funny actually. that other side of me slowly is dying and my rational mind is growing back. right now, i hope to be a friend who'll always be there for her. i will do everything to keep her from getting hurt. i put to use all the strength i have to make her life better than mine. this vow, i shall create other than my relationship vow.

      everywhere I look, there's something which reminds me of my issue. even if i'm trying my best to forget about it, something comes up and hits me straight in the heart. am i destined to never forget about these stirrings? why do i keep on facing things at every corner? every topic we faced has something linked to my life. perhaps it's because I always find a way to link it... I don't really know. The more I think, the more I remember her. these thoughts are driving me nuts! deep inside of me, there has been my issues of thinking that there's still hope if only i waited and built up with my personality and knowledge of her. now i'm torn between the bad and the bad... feel the missing feeling over and over or take a risk while waiting for the years to pass... I hope to God that I find my answer.

      "a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step" &nbsp; thoughts unbridled emotions freely spread ideas left without limits tears let loose to flow joys uncertain &nbsp; being a teenager is no cakewalk. i know that all too well. with all the relationship problems, moral issues, personal control... I'm surprised that I haven't cracked yet. Then again, I may  ALREADY  be crazy... "a man who says he's crazy is sane while one who says he's sane is crazy" I don't know where i heard this, but it has a point. how would you know we're not ALL crazy and those who are in the sanitarium are all the sane people in the world? is it by mere familiarity with what we're used to? doesn't it go the same with all the other things in the world? who tells us what is normal and what is wierd? is normal really normal? &nbsp; the thoughts of this world confuse me... i ask myself, why do I always hesitate to meet people? is it because I fear what they would think? I've known that very much... my problem: Why don't I do anything about it?  &nbsp; I sometimes feel that I am not who I really am. Sometimes, it feels like someone becomes me at different times. somthing like a split personality. For all I know, I am merely a vessel of 2 completely different souls: the passionate, romantic and care-free person who doesn't care about consequences of my actions and the moral, high-strung and realist type of person who takes things too seriously. Once in a while, they mix together to create another persona: the one I fear most. This is what I become when I face other people. I think too much and start to visualize myself crash and burn on what they think. this must be the curse of an artist and writer at heart...  &nbsp; that's all for now for I face life alone once again...

      I used to think that I tried to stay within the rules. I used to think that doing so was the right thing entirely. I used to think that I was one of the few who was "righteous". BIIIIIG mistake! I'm too high strung. I've distorted my values into being too bossy. I've gone on complaining of the "inferiority" of others as I was "good". Looking back as well, I've spent most of my life lying to myself, trying to fit in. I've been trying to join the "cool" crowd while setting aside my true friends.  It's surprising how all this leads to one deduction. Angelica Pickles, from "All Grown Up" , is the best character to discribe me. the only diff... I'm a guy. I'm reality's guy version of Angelica, whether I like it or not. The good side about it, people (and even angelica), change. She tends to show her true good nature and she loses her bossiness for her friends, even if it's more common to find a loch ness monster than that happening. Chances are, I may just as well change for the better. realizing a mistake is only the first step. one must understand, that this journey will have many other obstacles to maneuver from. with the guidance of the inner-me (that no one knows of until now) and the guidance of friends, I may just complete this journey of self-discovery.

      i've just come to realize... no matter what i'd do, she'll always be stuck in my head. forgetting about her is not an option... but, forgetting about a relationship is. she's still a friend and friends never deserve to be forgotten, no matter what. I know deep down, I still have feelings for her, but I now see that it's just my blind passion. It may.... no... will never happen. The illusions of grandeur would only haunt me if i lose my focus... my sanity. As I look back to what I have done, what I have become, I have become stronger, more mature in facing life at it's fullest. In the past, I have come to terms with ending it all from time to time. Thank goodness I never pushed through with it. Life brings more as time passes. Grievings, joys, disappointments, hatreds, fulfilled dreams. Even if there are bad times, God never lets anything happen without a purpose. Bad times make us better inside. They make us see the truth of the world and teaches us how to face them in the future. We understand the misconceptions of what we used to believe and experience them first-hand. As for now, I have seen the disappointment of a blind intention. I now know what I must do as well as what I must become. Life isn't a TV show in which you're the main character. It's more of a masterpiece in which each part of the picture melds to create what we see as a whole. Each person has a life, a soul in which problems arise, fears develop and dreams seem too real. "Doing what you're supposed to do" is never just one thing. It's never the same for each person. even if it's slightly similar, we must face them our own way. We must find them in order to truly be set free.  This is Patts, signing off.
