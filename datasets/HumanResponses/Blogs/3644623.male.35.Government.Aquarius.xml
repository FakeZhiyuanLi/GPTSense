      Today's New York Times has an article ( urlLink The Rise of the Buff Bunny ) about the number of female Olympians shedding clothing for men's mags this year.  The thrust of the article is that these women are part of a change in acceptable femininity, from either the stick figures favored on the runways of the world or the sliced up and rebuilt Barbies that normally sprawl on the pages of magazines like Maxim or Playboy (and, one assumes, prance through the daydreams of many men) to the trim and toned look.    To which I say - Yay! As my GOP Baby will attest, I find the athletic look not only aesthetically pleasing (yep, you can bounce a quarter off of the GOP Baby's abs...which could come in handy if she is ever attacked by a quarter hurling maniac).  I also think that it must be the most empowering and healthiest "body image" a woman can have.  The waif look would require most women over the age of 17 to subsist on nothing but water and celery sticks.  The Barbie body is fine, if you either have the Mattel gene or don't mind being ginsued and stuffed with silicon like a Dow Corning turkey (mmm...plastic turkey). Couple the unrealistic body images in pop culture with the rise of obesity in America and the "in-shape is sexy" trend is good all around.    Most people can exercise and show results.  While few of us will ever look like a supermodel or the Hollywood flavor of the month, many of us can see real changes through exercise and sensible living.  Women athletes are certainly better role models for girls than the Pam Andersons of the world.  And the positive effects of an exercise culture will be felt not just in better self-images, but also in healthcare and quality of life.

      I love Thai food.  I love hot, spicy Thai food.  And I love hot, spicy Thai food served by a pleasant, attentive waitstaff in a nice neighborhood restaurant while enjoying a great martini.  For all these reasons, I love Singh Thai.  The food is good and the cooking staff knows the meaning of "extra-hot."  My favorites are the Mountain Lamb (with a sauce just sweet enough to be flavorful without being cloying), the Crispy Duck (although the Nappa Cabbage the duck is served over can be a little limp), the fishballs, Kapow (order the chicken, extra-hot), and Drunken Noodles.  About the only culinary disappointment is to found in the steamed dumplings.  I've tried them a couple of times (I generally love dumplings) and they have been gummy and flavorless (the filling is made up of chopped chives...looks nice, but not exactly a robust taste) every time.  Oh, my GOP Baby wants me to mention the Wonton Soup.  It is pretty good, although they should shred the cabbage, not just toss leaves in. Order it and you'll see what I mean. Also, make certain you order either the Perfect Martini (with Bombay Sapphire, of course, and olives) or, if you don't feel like drinking, try the Thai Iced Coffee.  If you're coming on a peak night (Friday or Saturday), get there a bit early.  The place is pretty small (it seats about 40 - 50, tops) and it can fill up quickly.  Prices are low to moderate for the area (about $6 - $15 per entree). You can find Singh Thai at   2311 Wilson Blvd. Arling, VA Phone: 703-312-7118  Metro: Court House (Orange Line)

      Firehook is a local chain of coffee and noshes shops.  I just went to the Capitol Hill store for a loaf of their fab green olive and rosemary bread.  When I head there for lunch, I tend towards the salads - although they offer a wide selection of sandwiches, I find most pre-made, pre-wrapped sandwiches have soggy bread, a big no-no for me.  The reason to go, though, are the breads and cookies.  They have one, the chocolate mocha chew, which, along with a strong cup of coffee, is hard to beat.  Service is usually pretty good, if somewhat indifferent.  But, it's a coffee and pasty shop, so they don't have to dance and smile, as long as they are not expecting me to tip.  So, the next time the cookie jones hits you, find the nearest Firehook.  You won't be disappointed.  For more info,  urlLink go here .

                                       GitS:SAC is the first four eps of the television series based on the work of Masamune Shirow's manga.     What It's About  In 2030, Major Kusanage of the Japanese government's elite Section 9 fights to keep the Home Islands safe from terrorists, hackers, runaway cybertanks, and machines with emerging intelligence. Oh, and the Major, an ass-kicking hottie, is a cyborg, everything except her brain and spine having been replaced with a machine body.   The Good  The animation is beautiful.  While not quite at the level of the movie, it is still stunning.  Essentially, each 22 minute episode shows more care and detail than any Disney film. The characters are interesting and distinct.  The show has very "cop shop" feel to it, while the stories are pretty complex and thoughtful. The English language dubbing is pretty good.  The only really annoying voices are those of Section 9's cybertanks, which all sound like Mickey Mouse after sucking on a helium balloon.   The Bad  First, the length of each episode really detracts from the stories.  Each, except for the first, could have easily stood to be an hour long. Second, the disc ends with a cliffhanger, so you have to wait for volume two to see how it ends.    The Disc  The image is nice and the sound is crisp.  There are a few extras (interviews with the director and one of the voice actresses and a few trailers), but nothing too outstanding.  But, this really is a disc to buy for the main feature, not the extras.    GitS:SAC is an outstanding program, both for the art and the writing.  I highly recommend it and can't wait for volume two to be released.

      Welcome to Blog number 2.  I already have one,  urlLink Kinshasa on the Potomac , that deals with poltiics, foreign policy, science, etc.  But, I have another set of interests: movies, music, games, and so on.  Essentially, the "fluffy" stuff in life.  So, thanks to the miracle of Blogger, I'll use Nuthin' But Fluff as a forum for those interests.

      Well, the Democratic Party's most successful propagandist has had a good weekend at the box office, raking in over $22m this weekend.  Although billed by some as a documentary, it is obviously anti-Bush/anti-Republican propaganda and Moore hasn't really claimed otherwise (he hates Bush, Republicans and, if some of his statements are to be believed, Americans).  People seem to like his cinematic assault on the Administration, so let's compare him to the other great party propagandist of the 20th century, Leni Riefenstahl.  Hmm, well, both are used by their party bosses to stir up the true believers and paint all foes of the New Order (Nazism in one case, the attempt by the Dems to do...well, whatever it is they actually want to do, other than defeat Bush) as evil.  But, at this point, they diverge.  Riefenstahl was a fairly attractive woman.  Moore is a grotesque blimp.  And, of course, Riefenstahl knew how to use visual spectacle to enthrall audiences.  She actually was a good film-maker.  Moore, of course, has the visual style of a Midwestern slob with a camcorder...hey...  Anyway, now Democrats can pretend they're mushrooms - they get to go sit in the dark and be fed manure.  Rather than produce a documentary actually examining the policies of the last 50 years that led to the moment when airplanes were slamming into buildings and the assumption, both accurate and flawed, that led to our being in Iraq, Moore has chosen to perpetuate political manicheanism, with the democrats as the forces of light and the rest of us as evil incarnate.  A good documentarian could have begun from the premise that US policy was instrumental in creating conditions that led to the current crisis and that there are serious problems with the current Administration's Mid-East/Counter-Terror policies.  But, that would not involve bringing up the 2000 election or trying to explain everything as evil corporations and Republicans sending poor minorities off to fight peaceful, happy, kite-flying Iraqis.  It would not have had a segment with Bush sitting in a Florida classroom, being told what was happening in New York, and using it to try and show him as a befuddled idiot, because, those minutes when he sat there don't matter.  What matters is what happened in the days, weeks, months and years that followed.  But, then, Moore would have to actually examine evidence, not trot out conspiracies.  Moore would have to avoid mudslinging and, instead, rely on the force of reason and argument.  In short, Moore would have to be an intelligent, conscientious filmmaker and not an emotionally stunted, ideologically rabid propagandist.

      I've always thought the Atkins Diet sounded pretty stupid.  Now, the Telegraph is carrying a story about how it can  urlLink harm chances of pregnancy .  Here's an idea for all those people looking for some magic fix to their blimp problems; eat a balanced diet, don't neglect your fruits, veggies and fiber, don't overdo the booze, salt and sugar, get plenty of sleep, and get off your fat ass and exercise.  Seems pretty obvious to me.

      Man of the People, John Kerry, is married to Teresa Heinz, rich chick.  This we know.  According to the LA Times, she is worth twice the widely reported figure of $500m.  1 billion dollars.  Where are the cries from the Left of how plutocrats are running the show?  The Kerrys are worth more than W, Cheney and the rest could even dream of.  Why are they not described as being "out-of-touch" with the working class because of their wealth?  Oh, right, because rich Democrats are good, rich Republicans are evil.

      Looks like we've handed over sovereignty to Iraq today, 2 days early, and Paul Bremer has scampered from Iraq (hopefully to someplace for a well-deserved vacation).  Good idea, foiling any attempt by the insurgents to conduct a big attack on transition day.

      With the economy chugging along and solid job growth (over a quarter million last month) now sustained for almost 6 months, the Dems are still trying to convince people that we are step away from breadlines and double-digit unemployment.  The main tactic that Kerry and others are using is the "yes, there is job growth; but all of the jobs pay 2 dollars a day and involve manually masturbating grizzly bears, so who'd want them" argument.  Illinois Senate hopeful Barack Obama is the only the latest to use this line of assertion, claiming that the jobs that are be created are poorly paid and generally not what people want.  We'll leave the latter part alone - I can't comment on whether an unemployed person would rather not work than work; I know in my life I've had some pretty shitty jobs (like cleaning toilets for 6 bucks an hour) but I'd rather have a steady income not dependent on Uncle Sugar than not.  I can say, however, that the former is wrong.  Average income is up over the last 3 months and most of the jobs created are in the manufacturing sector or in the professional service sector (banking, real estate, IT, etc).  Of course, many have also been added to what I would assume the Dems are talking about - retail and food services.  However, the assumption that these are all minimum wage jobs or that none have benefits is ludicrous.  During my stint in food services, I made well above minimum wage (although I did not have benefits). My point is not that every new job created is wonderful.  Nor is it that there are people out there making less than they used to or with worse or no benefits.  My point is that the numbers do not support the Democrat's contention that the "jobless" recovery, while no longer jobless, still isn't good enough, because every job created doesn't involve either making 6 figures on an internet start-up that winds up producing nothing or stitching together sneakers on an union run assembly line like our grandparents did (okay, my grandfather actually worked in a union run auto plant and my grandmother - horror of horrors - ran the household). Manufacturing has been in a long decline and some of the tech bubble of the late 90s was just unsustainable.  Some jobs created, whether during an economic recovery or in the midst of a period of sustained economic growth, are worse than others.  But this recovery and the jobs created during the first of the year are broad-based enough and in the main in sectors that allow for a decent living to be made, to not warrant the doom and gloom of the Democrats.  Perhaps if they had a platform other than "We're not Bush" they could address some of the actual economic issues we face (long-term ones like the changing structure of the economy, the increase in life-spans and productive age, increasing costs from mandatory social programs, etc). Instead, they only offer fear and loathing.

      ..is sitting on my balcony, with a cup of strong coffee, a fresh chocolate croissant, the paper and the company of my fiancee.  Of course, that leads to me being hopped up on caffeine and sugar, infuriated by the Leftist nonsense in the Post and egged on by my GOP baby.  Hence, the reason I'm here; to rant and to rave.    First up, the Iranian government is blaming the US and the UK for an increase in opium production in Afghanistan and the continuing rise in the number of addicts in Iran (over 2 million).  The protest came complete with crowds shouting "Death to America."  First, isn't it odd that the Iranians don't see their own support for various anti-government warlords in the east as part of the problem?  Shouldn't they be helping to stabilize Afghanistan, in order to allow for more effective counter-drug operations?  Second, is there a temp agency in Iran that specializes in rabid, anti-Western crowds?  Kind of a "Kelly Mobs" for the Middle East.   The  urlLink horrible situation in the Sudan  gets front page coverage.  With millions on the brink of starvation - USAID estimates that 350,000 will starve or succumb to disease in the next 9 months - the response of the Sudanese government?  Arm the local militias who are carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing against tribal groupings in the region and claim, in the words of foreign minister Mustafa Ismail, that "[i]n Darfur, there is no hunger. There is no malnutrition.  There is no epidemic disease."  Instead, there is "a humanitarian situation."  What is the solution? Well, the West and the UN is trying to get food and other aid to the afflicted region.  But, again, this is a case of a genocidal government, one that practices massed bombing of civilians, one that exploits tribal differences in a campaign of ethnic cleansing and one that allows slavery within its borders.  By sending in a trickle - or even a torrent - of aid, we are doing the worst thing possible; providing the means by which the situation is perpetuated.  Either we should wash our hands of the whole area and allow the natural process of strife to play out, or we need to embark on a campaign to remove governments like the Sudanese one and replace them with something else.   From the dire to the dumb.  Ass clowns in Oklahoma like to participate in something dubbed "Extreme Fishing" by ESPN.  Apparently, the "fisher" plunges his hand in water teeming with catfish and waits for one to bite.  His hand.  Then he pulls it out of the water and, one assumes, clubs it, probably with his forehead, since his skull is obviously a solid mass. Um, guys, we have not been using our hands to catch fish for thousands of years.  Let's try to  evolve  not devolve, okay?  I mean, our reputation around the world is bad enough.  Whose going to listen to us when they see that we don't even know how to use a fishing rod?   In the "this almost gets him my vote" category, Ralph Nader called grotesquely overweight Mike Moore "a giant beach ball."  Although Nader is mostly a Leftist dolt, in this case, I can only agree completely.   Flavor of the week John Edwards, now being touted as Kerry's probable number two, was out drumming up support.  Apparently, the Kerry people decided that McCaine's "no" really did mean "no."  I understand that the party of Kennedy and Clinton has trouble with this concept, but it is nice to see that they may be evolving.  Of course, how long the current fixation with Edwards last is anyone's guess; probably until Kerry realizes that he looks like a piece of driftwood next to the more animated Edwards.     Well, on that note of partisan vitriol, I'll bring this morning's post to a close.

      Jeri Ryan, the  urlLink Borg chick from Star Trek:Voyager  (any and all jokes about "impressive implants", how she could "assimilate me anytime", or clever nicknames like "Barbie of Borg" and "2 of 44D" are appreciated), was apparently married to Republican Senate hopeful Jack Ryan back in the 90s.  According to court records recently from there divorce, Ryan (Jack) tried repeatedly to get Ryan (Jeri) to go to sex clubs, finally succeeding, only to fail in his attempts to get her to "perform" for some of the other patrons.  With their release, Ryan (Jacko) has  urlLink pulled out  of the Illinois Senate race, assuming that his opponents would use these revelations to ruin his reputation.  A few words of advice for any prospective future political candidates.  First, if you ask your SO to go to a sex club and he or she recoils in horror, don't keep trying.  Just laugh and say "Hey, I was kidding...I think a 'Frazier' rerun is on." Second, going to Paris and then looking for "Jean-Claude's Palace of Whips" is not a romantic get-away (apparently, he thought going to an S&M club in the City of Lights was just what his relationship needed).  And finally, if you are married to Jeri Ryan or someone who looks like her (or the male equivalent) why in the name of all that is holy are you even thinking about sex clubs?     That in and of itself is grounds for disqualification and a good sound thrashing.

       urlLink The Washington Times  is carrying a story detailing the effects of our defeat in Fallujah (how else can one term the turning over the city to ineffective or actively hostile militias, who allow terrorists and insurgents free reign?).  The story is eye-opening enough to reprint in full:   BAGHDAD — Residents of Fallujah say foreign insurgents have banned drinking and music, imposed their own courts to enforce strict Islamic law and killed more than a dozen people suspected of collaborating with  U.S. forces.      U.S. military officials, who turned the city over to an Iraqi-led "Fallujah Brigade" last month, say they have only anecdotal information about conditions in the city but remain concerned about the influence of fighters loyal to terror chief Abu Musab Zarqawi.      Regular travelers between Baghdad and Fallujah say various groups of mujahideen, or holy warriors, have turned the city 30 miles west of Baghdad into a haven for Islamist radicals.      Foreign fighters from Yemen, Syria and even Pakistan have set up checkpoints in many parts of the city, said Adnan Abdi, a Baghdad businessman who frequently visits Fallujah.      The mujahideen have imposed occasionally harsh versions of Islamic law, said several residents, some of whom were interviewed when disembarking at the Fallujah bus terminal in Baghdad.      Untroubled by members of the U.S.-backed military force known as the Fallujah Brigade, they said, the extremists have banned liquor and popular music and have established a special 6-week-old "mujahideen court" to dispense justice.      In the case of people suspected of passing information to U.S. forces, the "justice" is even more peremptory.      On Tuesday, witnesses said, a vehicle painted like a police car but probably operated by mujahideen pulled up to a stoplight next to a man suspected of helping the Americans find militants' safe houses. The "police," their faces covered, opened fire.      "I must have heard over a hundreds rounds," said Naqoz, a Fallujah resident and employee of a Western nonprofit group who asked that his family name not be published.      U.S. military officials and Iraqis struck a deal in May after weeks of intense combat that placed security in the city in the hands of the all-Iraqi Fallujah Brigade commanded by a former Saddam-era general.      But a senior military officer reached by telephone from Washington said yesterday, "We remain concerned [that Fallujah] is not under Iraqi government controls. ... Most of Fallujah remains under the control of foreign fighters, extremists and the Zarqawi network."      Zarqawi and his followers are blamed in the beheadings of two civilians and a string of suicide bombings. U.S. forces twice in the past week have rocketed houses in Fallujah that had been identified to them as Zarqawi safe houses.      The U.S. officer said the Fallujah Brigade was "making incremental progress" against the radicals, but that Marine commanders in charge of the region "are not completely satisfied with the pace of progress."      "There is anecdotal evidence of the [extremists] trying to set up a court system and harassing citizens. But there is no evidence their influence is dominant," the officer said.      Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, interviewed last night on Fox News, said officers on the ground deserved credit for trying to work with local leaders to get the resistance in Fallujah "to behave itself."      "Was it worth the try? Probably. Did it work? Not yet," he said.      Thomas V. Johnson, public-affairs officer for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force in Anbar province, which includes Fallujah, answered indirectly when asked about reports that extremists have killed more than a dozen people suspected of passing information to the Americans.      "We know that the latest tactic of anti-Iraqi forces is to intimidate and attack the will of the Iraqi people," he said.      Asked about the religious court, he said, "I have heard of some enforcement of religious codes, but I am not familiar with a special court."      But several residents said the courts dispense their punishments quickly and harshly upon those who violate their rules.      "If you steal, you will get your hand cut off. If you kill, you are killed. If you drink alcohol, you get lashed 80 times," said Amar Jassem, a 25-year-old Fallujah driver who shuttles passengers between the capital and his hometown in his minivan.      As many as 14 suspected collaborators had been fatally shot on the streets for giving information to Americans, said Fallujah resident Saad Najam Abdullah, who visits Baghdad to drink alcohol without fear of being arrested.      "We saw corpses all over the city," he said. "They put a piece of paper on the man's corpse with his name and citing evidence that he spied for Americans."      Like many of those interviewed, Mr. Abdullah spoke with surprising approval of the new regime.      "The mujahideen are applying Islamic laws very precisely against the criminals," he said.      "It's true that all music stores must sell only religious music, not other music," said Mostafa Javad, a 25-year-old university student who commutes daily between Baghdad and Fallujah. "But people in Fallujah are going into religion more and more every day."      Several said the residents tolerate the mujahideen, even allowing their own sons to join them, because of their rage against the American forces — whom they accuse of killing hundreds of civilians during the fighting that began in April.      Even before that, U.S. forces raided houses and made mass arrests in the city, which was a fiercely independent and hard-line stronghold even under Saddam Hussein's rule.      One of the few to object to the mujahideen presence was the man who identified himself only as Naqoz.      "There are Arabs from Syria, Yemen, Libya, Egypt," he said. "They come for jihad. They see Fallujah as a battleground between themselves and the Americans. ... The people of Fallujah are afraid of them."    By Borzou Daragahi and Rowan Scarborough    Great...first, whoever in the Administration thought that it made sense not to retake the city should be fired.  Second, the President needs to explain how the heck our allowing a city of 250,000 to slip out of our control and into the hands of the insurgents (or, what is closer to the truth, a collection of insurgents, terrorists, and criminals) is in any way helpful to Iraq.  The explanation given to us before was that we were making a deal that would calm things down and creat an opportunity for Iraqi security forces to take over.  Since neither of these have happened, why are we not sending troops in to regain control?  Third, if the Administration can't regain control of the situation, then the President needs to think about how much more damage he will do if he remains in office, not just to the country, but to the future of the GOP and the role of American in the world.  America is the main force for global stability; but a defeat in Iraq will cause a mass move towards isolationism, at a time when global problems are such that a leading role must be taken by America to help solve them.   There are so many reasons why this is the perfect example of how are Iraq policies are failing, happy noises and misdirection on the surface ("the Iraqis and in control" and "everything is quieter now"), while the reality is far, far worse.  While things could get better, it is hard to be sanguine with news like this.

      In yesterday's post about polio, I made the claim that most of the world is  "polo free."   And well it should be.  We have lived too long under the tyranny of men riding around whacking balls from horseback.  Are not our equine brothers worthy of freedom and democracy too?  I think it is high time that the Administration launches Operation Pony Thrust...or maybe Filly Freedom...Iron Horse Pull...hmmm, maybe this is an idea whose time has not yet come.  Or, maybe I just need coffee...

      One of the major WHO programs is the  urlLink Polio Eradication Initiative .  Great strides have been made until recently, with much of the world polo free (see  urlLink this page  for details).  However, in Nigeria, there has been a serious negative development.     The new outbreak is a triumph of superstition over science. The polio cases have spread from the state of Kano, in the mainly Muslim north of Nigeria. There, clerics have preached nonsense about the polio vaccination, claiming it was a western plot to depopulate Africa by rendering girls infertile, or even giving its recipients AIDS. Kano's state government, under pressure from the militant clerics, has suspended vaccinations. In January a committee of doctors and Muslim scholars set up by the state government said tests had revealed that the vaccine contained oestrogen, which plays a role in fertility. The WHO insists that other tests have refuted those claims. In May, Kano's government announced that vaccination would begin again, but this has not yet happened.   urlLink The Economist     Tales of sinister Westerners using science for evil purposes is nothing new.  For years, stories of blood tests being used to steal African blood for nefarious purposes are decades old.  And, in raw numbers, the new outbreak of the disease will probably be small (a few hundred to a few thousand).  But, it does highlight the fragile nature of the Nigerian state (divided between Christian south and Islamic north) and the way some elements of politcal Islam can use "the West" and any of its products - even when the positive effects seem to be obvious - to control the population.  Anti-Occidentalism is becoming the anti-Semitism of the 21st Century; a meta-concept that is used to inflame populations, serves as a rallying point for political and cultural elites and an excuse for every social ill.  Hopefully - for the sake of those who otherwise would be crippled by this disease - this will prove to be short-lived, part of the political jockeying going on in Nigeria. Still, it does demonstrate the tension between the West and all that is associated with it and those cultures that are either directly at odds with the West or can use fear or prejudice against the West in the local culture for political purposes.

      For alook at how politicians across the political spectrum regularly waste tax payer money, check out the  urlLink 2004 Pig Book  by  urlLink Citizens Against Government Waste .  Intersting bits include:    $1m added to the Defense budget for the "Young Patriots Program."  Do brown shirts cost that much?   $150k addded the the Defense Budget for the Military Sexual Integrity Program...well, I guess we want soldiers to maintian their, um, sex while in the service.   $50m for an indoor rainforest in the Iowa district of Charles Grassly (Republican and the head of the Senate Finance Committee).    Ah, page after page of this kind of stuff.  Warms the cockles of the heart, doesn't it?  Hey, I wonder if I can get a few million to identify what the cockles of the heart are?

      The State Department has reissued their 2003 issue of  urlLink Patterns of Global Terrorism , revising upwards the number of terrorist attacks for the year.  Whether through malice or mistake, getting wrong one of the barometers of our success in the War on Terror, and doing it in such a way that makes it look like the Administration is trying to make things look better than they are is not acceptable.  This isn't some flub made by the President at a press conference (we are all sadly used to those...the flubs, not the press conferences) or some internal memo.  This is one of the premier public documents produced by the government on the subject.  With all the other bad news today (a  urlLink wave of attacks across Iraq  and  urlLink two bomb attacks in Turkey ) this may seem minor.  But if the Administration can't get the little things right, how can they be trusted to handle the big things?

      I was checking out Slate and saw this amusing entry in the 'Kerryism' section:   Question: Didn't you tell the AP that you would aim to have U.S. troops out by the end of your first term?  Kerry: Yes, I would. That's my aim. You bet I would. I can't tell you I will. But if we can't achieve a free election in four years, and if we can't achieve some kind of progress that sufficiently brings the Iraqi people out of the shadows and into the open to invest in their own future in that period of time, we're in trouble. And I am not for just, in a vacuum, putting a lot more American troops in there without some kind of international agreement as to how we're proceeding.  —Washington Post interview, May 28, 2004    I can see why the Democracts love this man, can't you?  He has the ability to instantly take every possible position on an issue.  He is the first post-modern politician.  Ideas are plastic, and any view is the equal of any other, so why not hold them all?

      Just a few thoughts, really.  First, we will respond, probably by curtailing support for some UN peacekeeping operations, particularly if they involve nations that we do not have bilateral treaties with.  Second, that means that the people who will pay for this pointless snub are the denizens of strife torn nations, not the pampered elites of Berlin, Beijing, Moscow and Paris.  Third, it will damage the already shaky reputation of the UN with one nation it needs above all others; the United States.  Fourth, Kofi Annan's tying of UN legitimacy to an attack on the US has demonstrated what many of us have been saying for years; not that the UN per se is dysfunctional, but that the UN bureaucrats, like Annan, are adversarial to American interests, even to the detriment of the UN.  Again, the only ones hurt by this attack on the US are the UN and those who would benefit from our participation in peacekeeping operations.  American troops will never show up in The Hague.  So the point of this is to engage America in a pissing contest, to say to the American people "you are nothing, your sacrifices meaningless, your ideals a joke."  Oh, apologists for the ChiComs and the autocrats in Moscow will say this is a snub to the Bush Administration; but in the end, it is also an attack on the nation that Administration represents, ours.  This is not the time for over-reaction (although there is nothing wrong with verbal venting).  It is the time, however, to make the UN - and those in member states that use it to score political points at home and abroad - feel some pain.

      This from the  urlLink BBC :    The US has given up trying to get its soldiers immunity from prosecution at the new International Criminal Court.  It has withdrawn its attempt to have its exemption renewed by the United Nations Security Council, because it failed to gain enough support.    The US won special status for the last two years, arguing its troops could be subject to malicious prosecution.    But UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said it should not be renewed, partly because of the prisoner abuse scandal.    "The United States has decided not to proceed further with consideration and action on the draft at this time in order to avoid a prolonged and divisive debate," said the US Ambassador to the UN James Cunningham.    "We are dropping action on this resolution."    Even though US troops abroad may now be subject to prosecution at the court in The Hague, Washington has already signed bilateral agreements with 89 countries to ensure they do not bring cases against its personnel.     Fair enough.  The UN wants to harass US troops.  They want to see America, which is the main force for stability on the planet, treated like some petty dictatorship.  Fine.  It is their perogative.  My question: Why are we not leaving the UN now and kicking Kofi Annan out of this country along with the rest of his cronies?  We need to immediately suspend all support operations for all UN activities related to peacekeeping.  We need to withdraw all support from any member state that refuses to immediately sign an indefinite immunity agreement with us.  We need to let the world know that any action taken singularly or collectively has consequences.  Okay, deep breath...okay, maybe we don't need to pull out of the UN and stamp our really big feet.  But there should be some public action taken to show our displeasure.  Many nations will agree to immunity agreements (many already have).  And, in the end, I have a hard time believing anyone is dumb enough to try and seize US soldiers.  If anyone tries, then force should be used to retrieve them, wherever they are, whoever holds them.  The UN and our adversaries overseas (any nation that did not offer to support us on this should be seen as an adversary, in my opinion) need to know that actions taken against America like this one will never be forgotten.  The following nations had announced they would abstain, effectively killing the resolution granting immunity: Benin, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Germany, and Spain.

      This, from the Department of Energy:   Wyoming Governor David Freudenthal and project participants dedicated the state's largest wind power plant last week, marking commercial operation of the 144-megawatt Wyoming Wind Energy Center. The new wind energy facility employs 80 Vestas wind turbines, each capable of producing 1.8 megawatts of power. Originally developed by Orion Energy, the facility is owned and operated by FPL Energy LLC. The wind power is being sold to PPM Energy, which is marketing the power to wholesale customers, including 19 cities in Utah.   Wind power may be a new import commodity in the Pacific Northwest if Sea Breeze Power Corporation gets its way. The company is proposing to install a 990-megawatt undersea transmission line from Vancouver Island in Canada's British Columbia province to Port Angeles on Washington's Olympic Peninsula. The transmission line will "ensure the existence of an economic path to market for large amounts of renewable energy under development on Vancouver Island," according to the company. In March, Sea Breeze Power applied to the British Columbia government for approval to build a 450-megawatt wind plant, the Knob Hill Wind Farm, on Vancouver Island.    Very, very cool.

      Yep, I'm sitting at my desk, scarfing down my favorite burrito (spinach, rice, black beans, jalapenos and lime) from the best burrito place in the city, Burrito Brothers.  Although I've never had any of their other dishes in the past 8 years I've been eating there, why would I want to when the titular dish is so good?  Get the regular size (filling, without being bloating) and you have a meal for 5 and change.

      33 year old Kim Sun-Li, held by Moslem insurgents after being abducted near Fallujah last week, has been killed, according to Al Jazeera.  As seems to be the new trend among the insurgents/terrorists, the helpless captive was bound then decapitated.  Well, at least the Korean government is made of stern stuff, sticking by their pledge to send 3000 troops to Iraq (at least for now).  The South Koreans have a history of helping out in our less-popular wars, having deployed a couple of division to South Vietnam as part of the Free World Allies.  Hopefully, we will find the people who murdered Kim Sun-Li and deal with them appropriately.  We have yet to find the killers of Nick Berg or of the Fallujah Four, so I'm not going to hold my breath.

      Shouting "Allah Akbar", Chechen rebels attacked the Ingushetian capital of Nazran, seizing government buildings and killing at least 46, including the interior minister.  Russian troops are now pouring into Ingushetia and Putin has vowed to hunt down and destroy the insurgents, estimated at over 200. For a map of the Chechnya/Ingushetia region,  urlLink go here .  For more details of the attack,  urlLink go here .  This is another escalation in a war that receives far too little attention in the US.

      1 week until vacation...yay!  I get to spend 14 fun-filled days in fabulous Florida.  Nothing but booze, beach and books for two weeks.  No work.  No school.  No stress except where I want to go eat and whether I should flip over before my back starts to char.  Some days it's almost good to be alive.  Today ain't one of them...but next Tuesday will be.  I've come to the conclusion that I can no longer take vacations of less than two weeks.  If that means fewer vacations, fine.  But I find that only after a few days do I really relax and that last few days of any trip I'm mentally preparing for a return the the drudgery.  Anyway, back to our regularly scheduled rants.

      This  urlLink article  from the BBC details a new push by European police to crack down on honor killings.  This is the marvelous practice found in many areas of the non-Western world of murdering women (usually) who are family members (often killed by male relatives) who do something to 'dishonor' the family (in one case cited in the article, a 26 Kurdish woman in Sweden was murdered by her father for dishonoring the family by dating a Swedish man).  Gee, but wouldn't trying to stop this be an attack on their precious culture? Shouldn't we celebrate diversity and have "Murder Your Honorless Children" days?  Could it be that some practices are just not acceptable?  Could be...but that sounds too much like making a judgement based on Western morals and reason, doesn't it?  Can't have that now, can we...

      On 60 Minutes, President Clinton described the day he told his wife about his dalliance with Lewinsky his worst day in the White House.  Really?  I would have thought Waco, Oklahoma City, Khobar Towers, the Cole, Mogadishu, waging war against Serbia and dozens of life and death decisions and tragedies would have been worse.  I guess when you're Bill, however, the personal is all.  The rest of us were just an audience for his 8 year long ego trip.

      John Lehman, former Secretary of the Navy and current member of the 9/11 commission revealed that some intel points to at least one member of Saddam's security forces - the Fedayeen - was part of the Al Qaeda cell that carried out the 9/11 attack, although he hastened to add that this intel is unconfirmed.  Okay, this is interesting, although it may turn out to be nothing. My question; where the heck is the media - the same media like the Post and the Times - that rushed to declare that the 9/11 Commission's report on Iraq showed that the Administration was lying about 9/11 and Saddam, even when the Commission members said that the report actually was in broad agreement with the Administration (that there were contacts between Al Qaeda and Iraq, but that it was unclear to what level those contacts rose; probably somewhere short of operational cooperation).  Why are they now not rushing out with headlines screaming 'Saddam Officers Helped with 9/11' or 'Saddam Ties To UBL Prove Deep'?  The hate that some of the media feels towards Bush is so blatant that it is almost ludicrous.  Why even make a pretense of reporting the facts.  Just say "Bush and Republicans evil, kill puppies. Kerry and Dems good, give free ice cream to everyone." It would save time and, in the case of the NYT in particular, might keep a few more trees alive.  Read the  urlLink article .

      Well, I went over the Mall today, fighting swarms of locusts...um, tourists...to check out the World War Two Memorial.  God, it is awful.  I mean completely wretched.  Here we have the most titanic struggle in human history, one that touched every corner of the Earth and took over 60 million lives, one that saw mankind fight in every environment, from burning deserts to primordial jungles, from the depths of the oceans to the edge of space.  And what do we get...a wading pool surrounded by monoliths with the names of the US states and territories.  Great.  Instead of a towering monument to the sacrifice of millions, we get a place where fat tourists from Idaho can cool their feet.  Literally.  We have the names of some of the battles (although why Remagan Bridge gets its own engraving while the entire air campaign against Germany is just, well, the air campaign against Germany is unclear) and a few reliefs of farmers and factory workers and soldiers going off to..umm, someplace, as it is not clear what the heck they are doing. A couple of quotes provide little context for the war and there is a wall of gold stars, each representing 100 US dead, although if you just passed by them, you would have no way of telling what they are supposed to be, since they are small and off-center and fronted by a little pool (with a helpful sign telling the visiting chimps not to through coins in...what, you mean any body of water is not an excuse for the chunklettes from Des Moines to 'make a wish').  I was impressed by the triumphal eagles within the two main towers (one labeled Atlantic, the other Pacific, to denote the two theaters of war...although "Atlantic-European" and "Pacific-Asia" would have been far more accurate) holding aloft a huge bronze wreath...although, having them penned up inside of the towers, rather than atop them with wings spread wide against the sky makes them look a little too caged for my taste.  The main problem is that the thematic and structural center is...a wading pool.  Why did anyone think that that was a good idea....oh, wait, after the theme park attraction that is the FDR memorial, I guess I should have expected something you might find in Disneyworld, as opposed to a monument for the ages.  People are not supposed to feel part of a memorial.  People are not supposed to sit in the lap of our great wartime leader and have their picture taken.  Thank God they cordoned off the Korean War memorial; I can just picture little kids dangling from the statues' rifles.    When you see the Washington Monument, it is a tower of stone rising into the sky, dwarfing the viewer.  When you go into the Lincoln Memorial, you are in the presence of an American God, looking down upon you with sad, wise eyes.  Even at the Vietnam Memorial, you feel the crush of our loss, the toll of the dead in a conflict that ended with our defeat.  At the WW2 Monument you feel like throwing bread crumbs to the ducks.  You do not feel triumph of sacrifice, the two things a war monument commemorating victory should make you feel.  Well, at least for those who thought it might break up the visual axis of the Mall, have no fear.  From the Lincoln memorial, it's hard to tell what it is.

      The  urlLink Arab News  out of Saudi has a  urlLink good article  on the struggle for women's rights in the Kingdom.  The author, Dr. Khaled M. Batarfi, is addressing the conservative backlash against expanding the rights of women.  His best point, and the one too many people both in the Middle East, but mainly here in the West seem to have forgotten is "In the real world rights were never granted, they had to be taken. Women and other underprivileged groups must prepare for a long and bitter struggle with those whose interests happen to be in conflict with theirs."  Exactly.  Many in the United States have forgotten that our rights were bought with the blood and sweat of our forefathers.  Governments and power elites are inherently conservative (in the sense they are satisfied with a status quo that sees them in charge).  We would do well to remember that something given be the stroke of a pen can be taken away just as easily; something won through struggle is much harder to negate.

                                       I and a few mates saw  Bubba Ho-Tep  last night.  Pretty darn cool.  The movie features an aged Elvis (Bruce Campbell) and a man who might be JFK (Ossie Davis) fighting a mummy in Texas retirement home. What could have been a slapstick comedy or a spoof of horror movies instead becomes a fairly serious look at aging,  at what it means to see all your hopes and dreams not fail, but just end.  Yes, there are a lot of funny moments.  This is not high drama.  But it also is not without poignant moments or a dramatic foundation. It also maintains a bit of the dream quality of writer/director Don Coscarelli's better known movie  Phantasm .  I would say it is worth a rental and don't let the meandering pace during the first 30 - 40 minutes turn you off.  While a movie that has characters using walkers fighting a shuffling corpse is not going to become a John Woo-esque ballet of bullets and explosions, the pace does pick up and the slow beginning of the movie serves to build enough of a character for Elvis that he becomes more than just a string of pop culture references.

      Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, the senior Al Qaeda leader in Saudi Arabia and the man directly responsible for the murder of Paul Johnson was killed a short time ago in a shoot out with Saudi security forces.  He, and two other terrorists, were found in a middle class neighborhood in Riyadh while trying to dispose of Johnson's body.  Good job, although it is unfortunate that Saudi security forces were not on the ball enough to find al-Muqrin before he murdered our countryman.  But, at least he'll kill no more.

      Paul Johnson, a US employee of Lockheed Martin kidnapped by an Al Qaeda cell in Saudi Arabia has been murdered, decapitated by his captors.  First, we should all take a moment to reflect on the terror he felt and sorrow his family felt.  Second, we need to make it clear that when we find the people who committed this atrocity, there will be no trial, no turning over to other authorities, no ICC nonsense.  They'll be killed or, if we capture them, tortured until they've given us all useful information and then killed.  Third, the Saudis need to be told in no uncertain terms that they will allow our forces to take the lead in hunting these bastards down.  We may also want to think about hunting down the relatives of every terrorist and killing them.  Would these jihadis be so motivated to attack Americans if they knew that mom, dad and little sis were going to wind up with US bullets in their skulls?  I don't know, but it is worth a try.    Oh, and as to the feelings of the Arab street on any retaliatory measures we take?  Screw them.  We have the bomb, they don't.  300 million Arabs can be killed off in an afternoon, if necessary.  Okay, that might be a bit extreme. But weakness in the face of the savage murder of our citizens will not cause the masses of the Middle East to like us or respect us; it will only encourage their contempt.

      According to the Billster, yep.  In an interview with Dan Rather, he called his affair with Lewinsky a "moral error" - I guess his other dalliances were not.  He then goes on to say that the impeachment process - brought forward, incidentally, not for the affair per se, but for lying under oath and for abusing his office - was "an abuse of power" and that his victory over what he believes to be a right-wing conspiracy (although he thinks Hilly shouldn't have labeled it a conspiracy) is a "badge of honor." And he has the audacity to call Ken Starr unethical.    It is sad that people still look up to a man who is so self-absorbed and immoral that he can find such behavior a badge of honor (and yes, I think for the president to lie to the American people and in court of law is not an act that makes one heroic).  Plenty of Leftists will chortle with glee about this; but this only demonstrates how morally bankrupt they are.  No one should agree with Clinton on this.  One can disagree on whether his having an affair was a public matter (I think not, as long as it did not leave him open to blackmail).  One can even question whether what he did rose to the standards necessitating impeach (I think abuse of office, abuse of the trust inherent in it and lying in a court of law does). But I don't see how anyone - other than someone as monumentally self-absorbed as Clinton - could find the act heroic.  The Post article on the interview can be found  urlLink here .

      I'm reading the Post's Anne Applebaum column today ( article ) which has to do with the mounting evidence that at least some of the abuse perpetrated at Abu Ghraib was sanctioned from at least the level of the Pentagon and, perhaps, up to the White House.  She ends by essentially calling for public pressure on Congress and the Administration to pursue an investigation that eventually lays blame at the feet of the Administration.  My question is, why does she assume that most of the public cares that much about a group of people, many of which were shooting at Americans and/or Iraqi civilians before being arrested?  The Abu Ghraib situation is a problem because of the public relations damage it has caused the United States and because it shows that some elements of the military in Iraq have suffered a breakdown in the chain of command (read Taguba's report for more on this).  And some of what was done just seems sadistic, particularly if it was not done in the context of an interrogation (i.e., if the guards were just having there own brand of "fun").  But the people that were subjected to the abuse at Abu Ghraib and the people at other camps in Iraq and at Gitmo who have been subjected to coercive questioning techniques are not "good guys".  They are the enemy.  Our enemy beheads American civilians and flies planes into buildings full of women and children.  If we force some jihadi to wear panties on his head or don't let him get his beauty sleep, does that really matter?  Particularly if these tactics allow us to gain useful information?    How many Americans are losing sleep over what is being done to terrorists in our custody? And, more to the point, should they be losing sleep?  I think not, given the nature of the enemy and his goals.

      The UN Security Council passed a resolution yesterday (for the text Res. 1556 and related commentary, go to the  urlLink UN press center ) calling for Sudan to end its support for the Muslim Janjaweed militias.  If this is not done the resolution references sanctions measures allowed under Article 41 of the UN Charter.  Article 41 reads   The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations.   For the million plus people on the verge of annihilation, I'm certain it is a comfort to know the international community may stop sending mail to Sudan. The reactions to the resolution from some surrounding countries are of note.  In Egypt, Hossam Zaki of the Arab League, in response to this attempt by the UN to do something, at least, asked, "How come the Security Council and those with a humanitarian agenda are so active when it comes to such a situation, when they turn a blind eye to the miserable situation in the Palestinian territories?"  Because, as we know, the Arabs find it impossible to think about anything and not relate it to Israel.   "This a great dinner, honey." "Yes, but it would be better if not for the Zionists, Crusader, Oppressors of the Palestinians.  Oh, and a little more salt would help."   Sigh.  The Sudanese ambassador was understandably upset that the UN wants the government in Khartoum to stop slaughtering their own citizens.  He said this humanitarian gesture was really just the US and its allies acting in a "colonial" fashion.  He also said   "Aren't these the very same states that we see daily on TV monitors and their massive military machine while they are practicing the occupation of nations, pouring their fire on innocent civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan?"    Given that their regime is not unlike those that once ruled in Kabul and Baghdad, I can understand the concern that at some point the US might just get sick of seeing millions oppressed, murdered, raped, and enslaved and do something more vigorous than threaten economic sanctions. For hubris though, the award goes to China.  With their record of oppression, both of their own people and the Tibetans, they decided it best to abstain and call for "respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country."   Our allies in the war on Terror, the Pakistanis - also abstained.  Why?  Although the Pak ambassador acknowledged that the black Muslims being killed were, well, Muslims, he said that "his country had consistently counseled a calibrated approach to the situation in Darfur.  While Pakistan appreciated the amendments made to the resolution, the final text lacked the necessary balance."  What balance is that?  Don't kill too many women and children?  Only rape girls over 16?  Only one 30 round clip a day for random shootings?  Just curious. Again, the Resolution may not amount to much in the end.  But, it is always interesting to see how regimes that routinely murder and oppress their own people react to the civilized world condemning those practices.

      Well, let's take a look at what Kerry had to say about...well...Kerry.     "I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty." - Groan.  Okay, I guess it was kind of cute, but unless he was aiming at self-parody, I think we all know he was in Vietnam by now.   "My dad did the things that a boy remembers." - Another nit, but this is a strange way to refer to himself, isn't it?  Shouldn't that be 'My dad did things that I remember."  It's almost like he was given touchy-feely boiler plate and forgot to insert 'I' or 'me' at the appropriate points.   "When I came to the Senate, I broke with many in my own party to vote for a balanced budget, because I thought it was the right thing to do. I fought to put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America. And then I reached out across the aisle with John McCain to work to find the truth about our POWs and missing in action and to finally make peace in Vietnam." - That's it? After being in the Senate for 20 years, he can only squeak out 3 sentences.  I guess "As a Senator I stood side-by-side with Daniel Ortega just before he went to Moscow looking for weapons" doesn't look good on someone's CV, but surely he did more than that.   "I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war. I will have a vice president who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws. I will have a secretary of defense who will listen to the best advice of the military leaders.  And I will appoint an attorney general who will uphold the Constitution of the United States." - Ah, the fabled Democratic high road.  So, John thinks the President is a liar, the VP corrupt, the SecDef ignores advice that he knows is "the best" and the Attorney General is violating the Constitution.  Let's have some proof, Kerry.  Slander, anyone?   "My fellow Americans, this is the most important election of our lifetime. The stakes are high. We are a nation at war: a global war on terror against an enemy unlike we've ever known before." - He probably believes this, given that he didn't see the Soviets as a threat.  I would say that voting during the 70s and 80s was far more important, since poor leadership could have led to a general war.  But, the late-Cold War Dems never had much use for the idea that the Soviets were a threat, so Kerry is just displaying his Leftist core.   "And let's not forget what we did in the 1990s: We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt. We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty. And we lifted the standard of living for the middle class." - Who is we?  The Democrats?  The Democrats weren't in charge in Congress, the Republicans were.  And, is he seriously saying the Federal government is responsible for the tech boom?  How?  But, again, the Leftist in Kerry comes out.  Government - run by a Leftist elite, of course - is the source of all good.  The tens of millions of workers, investors, entrepreneurs, they don't do anything expect provide financial resources (taxes) for the government elites.   "This son of a millworker is ready to lead. And next January, Americans will be proud to have a fighter for the middle class to succeed Dick Cheney as vice president of the United States."  - Another groan.  We get it, Edwards working class boy made good.  Does it really matter? And, for the record, Dick Cheney has the same kind of background, except he has spent most of his life in government, unlike his "son of a mill worker" who has spent most his life getting 33% from his clients.   " I know there that are those who criticize me for seeing complexities -- and I do -- because some issues just aren't all that simple." - Actually, I would say he oversimplifies things.  His constant refrain about how the President should have just "known" that the intel he was receiving was not as solid as he was told it was, the need to balance the cost of going to war in Iraq with the risk of not doing so, the apparent reduction of a complex web of international relations and a nations with a wide variety of goals to "they don't like Bush, they'll like me."  Seems shallow and simple to me.   "And as president, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: The United States of America never goes to war because we want to; we only go to war because we have to. That is the standard of our nation. (APPLAUSE)" - I left the applause in because these Dems are applauding nothing.  What I mean by that is that any war can be justified as "necessary."  It all depends on your Point-of-view.  So,  what Kerry is saying is his pov is the only possible one.  I guess we should be grateful to have the font of Truth and Wisdom running this year.   "And on my first day in office, I will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces: You will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace." - To be fair, the Administration did have a plan.  It just sucked.  So, I'll give that to Kerry.   "I will never hesitate to use force when it is required. Any attack will be met with a swift and a certain response." - Okay, so Kerry would only wait until we were attacked!?!  Interesting.  Well, if he wins, I'm leaving DC; while it might be some comfort to know that if Washington is reduced to a crater, President Kerry would retaliate.  But, I would prefer President Bush who won't wait for thousands or millions to die.   "We will add 40,000 active duty troops, not in Iraq, but to strengthen American forces that are now overstretched, overextended and under pressure.  We will double our Special Forces to conduct terrorist operations, anti-terrorist operations, and we will provide our troops with the newest weapons and technology to save their lives and win the battle. And we will end the backdoor draft of the National Guard and reservists." - Okay, most of this is pretty good.  Is the 40K on top of the recent expansion of forces though?  I do like the idea of doubling special forces, although I wonder if realizes that doing so would require more than 40,000 troops?  I mean the Congressional research Service puts SOF numbers at about 47,000. And, finally, his comment about the National Guard and the Reserves: There are about 40,000 National Guardsmen in Iraq alone.  So, where are those numbers going to be made up?  If he was being honest, he would put the number of personnel at more like 400,000, not 40,000.   "In these dangerous days, there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words." - You mean like taking down two of the worst regimes on the planet?  Like creating a new Homeland Security Department?  You mean, like freezing assets of terror organizations?  Well, I guess the Administration already knows that, don't they?   "Today, our national security begins with homeland security. The 9/11 commission has given us a path to follow, endorsed by Democrats, Republicans and the 9/11 families. As president, I will not evade or equivocate; I will immediately implement all the recommendations of that commission. We shouldn't be letting 95 percent of our container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected. We shouldn't be leaving nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection. And we shouldn't be opening firehouses in Baghdad and shutting them in the United States of America." - Actually, while containers are not be inspected, we are ramping up ship inspections.  But I do agree that the ports are a big hole.  So why the heck do we need more firefighters?  To clean up the mess after a bomb has gone off?  Fighter-fighters do not stop terrorists.  But, they do have a union and they do vote.  Guess we see where his priorities are.   "As president, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits." - Good for him.  At least he is honest that, in order to gain votes from seniors, he is condemning people like me to a Social Security System that will collapse by the time I reach retirement age.  So, if you're under 50 and want to either double your taxes or wind up hunting for squirrels and dumpster diving when you hit 70, vote for Kerry.   "What does it mean when 25 percent of the children in Harlem have asthma because of air pollution?" - Um, it means you a lying jackass?  The study he pulled this from gave a number cause other than particulate matter: genetic factors, asthmatic children were about 50 percent more likely to live with a smoker, pollen, dust, animal dander, cockroaches (really; lots of people are allergic to roaches) and cold air were thought to be among the contributing causes, along with urban air pollution.  So, either he cannot read, or just like implying that Bush and his evil cronies like getting poor kids sick.   "So here is our economic plan to build a stronger America: first, new incentives to revitalize manufacturing; second, investment in technology and innovation that will create the good-paying jobs of the future; third, close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. Instead, we will reward the companies that create and keep good- paying jobs right where they belong, in the good old USA. " - So, more corporate welfare.  cool.  I need to start up a company.   "[W]e will trade, and we will compete in the world. But our plan calls for a fair playing field, because if you give the American worker a fair playing field, there's no one in the world that the American worker can't compete against." - So, in Kerry's vision of the free market, we never lose a job, we never have another company from outside the Us produce a better or cheaper product, we always run a trade surplus.  Well, if he can do that, cool.  How?  I don;t see a plan for doing this (and changing the tax code isn't going to be enough).  As with everything else, it shows the simplicity of Kerry's thought processes or the utter contempt he holds his constituency in.  I think the latter.   "[I]t treats teachers like the professionals that they are." - You mean, we can actually fire teachers who can't read and write more proficiently than their students?  Great.  But, the teachers' unions don't like that.  Hmm, what is John to do....   "Our health care plan for a stronger America cracks down on the waste, and the greed and the abuse in our health-care system, and it will save families $1,000 a year in premiums. You'll get to pick your own doctor. And patients and doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make medical decisions." - what about tort reform?  What about ending the types of lawsuits that make rich lawyers and send the rest of health costs soaring?  Will Edwards allow tort reform?  He hasn't like it thus far.   "We value an America that controls its own destiny because it's finally and forever independent of Mideast oil. What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we have only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for 53 percent of what we consume?" - Good.  Really.  Something I completely agree with Kerry on.  Well, like a broken watch he has to be right twice a day, yes?   "I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush. In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity. Let's respect one another. And let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States." - First, the audacity to tell the President that the high road should be taken, after calling him a liar and his closest colleagues dolts and criminals.  Second, the dig at the end about the Marriage Amendment was unfair.  I agree that the Amendment was a bad idea.  I support gay marriage.  But, I also believe that the President and the supporters of the Amendment in Congress and in the general populace wanted it because of their deeply held beliefs, not for cheap politics.   "What if we have a president who believes in science, so we can unleash the wonders of discovery like stem-cell research and treat illness for millions of lives?" - HAHAHA...so, after calling for a positive campaign, he says the President doesn't "believe" in science.  First, I'm not certain even what that means (he thinks Bush doesn't like the scientific method?  He thinks the President doesn't like some fields of science?  Some current theories? What is it?).  But, second, opposition to expanding fetal stem cell research is not opposition to science.  It is opposition to one line of research in one field.  It is a position I disagree with, but Kerry, if he wants to change the tone of the campaign should refrain from these overly broad, idiotic attacks.    Okay, there's even more, but I think you get the gist.  Kerry presented a mix of attacks on the character of the President and on Republicans, while offering a mishmash of Leftism and wishful thinking.  All of you Dems out there, repeat after me - four more years.

      I've never been a big fan of Tom Ridge as Homeland Security Director (I know little of his career as governor; he may have been wonderful in  that role).  I always thought that; a) someone with more national security experience was needed and b) someone who didn't have the face and personality of a wet weasel would have a been a better choice since pr is part of his job.  But, he seemed to be doing an okay job.  Now, I wonder.  According to the is article on  urlLink Yahoo  he thinking of stepping down.  He gives two reasons why.  The first is that he is burned out by the stress of the job.  This is completely understandable.  He has a Herculean task, not only being responsible for US security, but also creating a massive new agency.  But the second reason; well, he just doesn't make enough money and he wants to go into the private sector where he can cash in on his experience and insider ties.  And what is the pittance he is know making, which will, according to him, not allow his kids to go to college?  Oh, a measly $175k.  And he owns an $873k home and, in 2003, he owned between $122,000 and $787,000 in stocks and funds.  What a jackass.  While he isn't filthy rich, he is making more money than many people will see in a decade of labor.  He is living in a home that most people couldn't dream of owning.  Hey, if his lifestyle is too extravagant for his kids to go to Harvard, or wherever, how about going to a state school (like I did) or maybe selling the million dollar home and living more reasonably (like lots of other people have to do)?    I have a hard time feeling much sympathy, as you can tell.    And one has to question his political decision-making.  Given that it is an election year, the perception that some members of the Administration are only interested in lining their pockets and the other perception that the GOP is the party of the rich, wouldn't you be careful about who you said such things to?  With the way Washington leaks, wouldn't you just stick with the "I'm stressed" explanation, unless you were talking to the President, in a locked room, in an underground bunker, in Death Valley?

      From the State Department:     U. S. Support for Palestinian Refugees  President George W. Bush has authorized the Department of State to use up to  $20 million from the US Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to  assist Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and Gaza through the United  Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East  (UNRWA). This contribution is in response to the agency's $193 million 2004  emergency appeal to fund food, shelter, health, and other urgent humanitarian  needs of the over 1.5 million Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and Gaza.  This brings our total contribution to the emergency appeal to $40 million in  2004. The United States is the largest bilateral donor to UNRWA. We continue to  encourage other donors to respond urgently to this emergency appeal.   So, the same of the same people who are marching in the streets, calling for US blood are eating food we have bought and living in homes we have paid for.  It would be interesting to see what true disengagement from the Middle East by the West would mean, wouldn't it?  No more money for humanity aid.  No more access to our Universities.  No more pressure for human rights improvements.  No more economic assistance.  And, since the incentives would be there to rapidly shift to a post-oil economy, eventually no trade.  Because, all of these are types of "interference."  I think what most people who want us to stop "meddling" in the Middle East really mean for the US and the West to serve as a judgment from piggy bank, a play-ground in which they can come to visit and receive an education, a source technology and science, etc.  How long would the modern Middle East last on its own?  Just something to think about.

      John Edwards gave his little speech last night.  Some was the normal, happy-talk boiler-plate of any political speech.  Some was an attempt to score points because of his working class background.  Hey, I'm from the working class; does that make my writings more valuable than those who are from more well-heeled families?    There were, however, a few things he said that deserve comments.    Regarding his service in Vietnam: "Decisive, strong: Is this not what we need in a commander in chief?" - Okay, the only problem with this is his repudiation of that service when he returned, his condemnation of US soldiers as war criminals, his view that the United States was a criminal nation because of the war.  Now that he is trying to trade in on his service, he has downplayed his stance upon returning from Vietnam.  So, how decisive, how strong is he?  If he thinks that most of his fellow soldiers were committing war crimes (including himself, I assume) and that America was (and perhaps still is, given some of his subsequent policy stances and statements) why not say that.  And, if not, what has changed?   "So when a man volunteers to serve his country, the man volunteers and puts his life on the line for others, that's a man who represents real American values." - Okay, this is probably unfair, but, what the heck; does this mean that the same men who Kerry said were committing war crimes in Vietnam or, in the current war, made flesh pyramids in Iraq represented the best of America?  Keep in mind that the majority of men who fought in Vietnam volunteered for service (only about a quarter of military personnel during the war were draftees).  My point is not that most members of the military don't represent the best America has to offer; they do.  My point is that Kerry's past stances and statements should be kept in mind when he - or his followers - try to wrap themselves in the flag.   "John is a man who knows the difference between right and wrong. He wants to serve you. Your cause is his cause. And that is why we must and we will elect him the next president of the United States." - Um, again his stance after the war, during the 80s (when he was pro-Sandinista), during the 90s (against the Gulf War, Part One) make it unclear how well-honed his sense of right and wrong actually is.   "They are doing all they can to take the campaign for the highest office in the land down the lowest possible road. But this is where you come in: Between now and November, you, the American people, you can reject the tired, old, hateful, negative politics of the past. And instead you can embrace the politics of hope, the politics of what's possible because this is America, where everything is possible." - See my entry for yesterday on this ( urlLink Remember, They're Uniters, Not Dividers ).   "[O]ne, for all of those people who have lived the American dream and don't have to worry, and another for most Americans, everybody else who struggle to make ends meet every single day. It doesn't have to be that way. We can build one America where we no longer have two health care systems: one for families who get the best health care money can by, and then one for everybody else rationed out by insurance companies, drug companies, HMOs." - Ah, class warfare is fun!  First, is we are performing a socio-cultural-economic analysis of the American population, there are lots of different Americas.  Second, I have yet to see John Edwards or John Kerry donating there millions to the masses.  Third, as far as healthcare "rationing," why should anyone believe that the government would do a better job than the free (or semi-free) market?  This is the implication of his statement.   "We shouldn't have two public school systems in this country: one for the most affluent communities, and one for everybody else. None of us believe that the quality of a child's education should be controlled by where they live or the affluence of the community they live in." - So, he wants to Federalize the public schools.  Again, why does he assume the Federal government will do a better job?  Is it merely a resource question?  Because some of the worst school systems (like DC's) have the highest per capita expenditures on education.   "First, we can create good-paying jobs in this country again. We're going to get rid of tax cuts for companies who are outsourcing your jobs and, instead, we're going to give tax breaks to American companies that are keeping jobs right here in America." - Actually, this is something I find myself in agreement with.  I don't know what the actual effect would be - what kind of tax break makes up the difference for the lower labor costs and government support that one finds in other countries? And, actually, if the Feds use the tax code to whack companies that are moving jobs out, might they not just pick up and leave altogether?  Still, this  seems  like a decent idea.   "We're going to roll back -- we're going to roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. And we're going to close corporate loopholes. We're going to cut government contractors and wasteful spending." - Okay, he continues playing the class card and then says that one the first acts they'll attempt (because Congress does have a say in these things) is to fire a bunch of contractors.  Interesting way to "grow jobs."   "[W]e're going to raise the minimum wage, we're going to finish the job on welfare reform, and we're going to bring good-paying jobs to the places where we need them the most." - It is pretty well established that raising the minimum wage actually slows job growth.  So, with their other anti-business and economically suspect policies, I guess we can look forward to a John-John Recession.  Oh, and how does the President "bring good-paying jobs to the places where we need them the most?"  I would like Edwards to explain their plan for this.  And, finally, maybe he should level with the American people (Bush and the GOP should do this too) and tell them that the days of high-wage, low-skill jobs that were the hallmark of the mature industrial age are over.  The economy is becoming one of low-skill, low-wage and high-skill, high-wage workers.   "We will always use our military might to keep the American people safe. And we, John and I, we will have one clear unmistakable message for Al Qaida and these terrorists: You cannot run. You cannot hide. We will destroy you." - So, what is the difference?  The current Administration is already doing this.   "[W]e can get NATO to help secure Iraq. We can ensure that Iraq's neighbors, like Syria and Iran, don't stand in the way of a democratic Iraq. We can help Iraq's economy by getting other countries to forgive their enormous debt and participate in the reconstruction." - This is equal parts nonsense and recklessness.  The French have made it clear that they do not want NATO to have much of role in Iraq.  To believe Edwards you must think that, a) he will have magic powers or b) that the opponents of our liberation of Iraq based their policies on a personal dislike of Bush.  I don't believe this.  As to Syria and Iran, what more will John-John do?  Go to war?  Essentially, you need to accept that the very presence of a new Administration would greatly change the global environment, even though, based on actual policy statements made, many of the policies that nations like France and German disagreed with wouldn't change that much.   "And together, we will ensure that the image of America -- the image all of us love -- America, this great shining light, this beacon of freedom, democracy and human rights that the world looks up to, is always lit." - Probably the most dangerous thing said.  It shows that John-John have seriously misread the global situation, assuming that the differences that fuel anti-American sentiment and the conflict between civilization are ephemeral and that just having a new President who would make the right noises about multi-lateralism is enough.  It is not.  We are in a war with people who seem things radically different than we do.  Our values are not their values.  Our goals are at odds with their goals.  This naive view of the world - one that seems to be shared by some in the current Administration as well - is one the greatest problems we face.  Until the magnitude of the struggle is realized and accepted, we will forever be waiting for the right combination of surface changes in our policies or our image to make everyone "love" us again.   "And American soldiers don't have to fight this war in Iraq or this war on terrorism alone." - Which they are not doing now.  If I were in the Italian, Polish, Pakistani or even, yes, the French government (since they have troops in Afghanistan) I would be a little irritated that, for the purpose of scoring political points, John-John has decided to ignore the contribution our allies have made in both the War in Iraq and the War on Terror. I'm not certain how they plan on rebuilding our global image when they are unaware of - or just don't care about - the sacrifices others have made to help.    Well, that was fun.  Can't wait for John Kerry to make his speech tonight. Oh, for the full transcript go to the  urlLink Washington Post .

      An Iranian Court has ruled that the death of photo-journalist Zahara Kazemi while in Iranian custody was an accident.  According to the court, the woman who was born in Iran but later moved to Canada and who had been arrested for taking photos outside of Evin prison in Tehran, had died due to a blow on the head after she passed out due to low blood pressure.   Right.  After three days of interrogation, she just happened to fall and kill herself, essentially.  Obviously, the conservative judiciary is trying to cover up a murder by someone higher up than the intel officer who actually stood trial.  Even Iranian President Khatami has said the court should identify "the real guilty person."  While reform is happening in Iran, the religious leadership is obviously not going to go quietly into the night. For more go to the  urlLink BBC .

                           I read  Ecological Disaster: Cleaning Up the Hidden Legacy of the Soviet Regime  by Murray Feshbach last night.  The book (actually a report from 1994) is a good intro to the ecological problems left behind by the Soviet Union.  While 10 years old, it does serve as a primer for the problems that Russia and the former Republics face and as provides an historical foundation upon which to build with further research.  The main problem the Russians faced then, and face today, is the collapse in health care and the demographic crash that is overtaking the country.  For the world, the problems are probably worse, as we have to deal with the legacy of 70 years of communist mismanagement and almost pathological disregard for the environment and the last 13 years of corruption and scarcity of resources for cleaning up the mess.   This is an issue that still receives too little public attention.  While it is important to clean up and monitor the environment at home, it is of equal, if not greater, importance to focus on regenerating the environment that was once part of the Soviet Empire.

      In my last entry I railed against the Democrats who were turning this election into a hate-fest.  I do not think all Democrats are like this.  None of the people I personally know who are Democrats would fall into the "Al Qaeda-like fanatic" category.  Nor do I think that disagreeing with the Administration makes you a hate-filled, anti-American zealot.  I disagree with many of the policy positions the Administration has taken.  What I find disturbing are those people who have what I consider an irrational hatred of an entire class of people based on their party affiliation or their views on what is best for America.  I also dislike even more those people who should know better - like President Clinton - yet use hate-filled rhetoric for cheap applause and the chance to hold the reins of power again.   A nation in the grips of such passions and such base manipulations of those passions cannot survive.  We can only defeat our foes and ensure that our way of life prospers and spreads if we do not turn on each other.

      The Dems are trying to portray themselves as a force for positive change, the Party that wants to unite America.  So, what's being said by convention goers and guests?  Here's a run down drawn from various media sources.    'Rep.

They think we want to destroy liberty and that the country must be retaken from us.  That Republicans and others who agree with some of their ideology are responsible for millions starving in this country and the North Korean nuke program. That before Bush the world was at peace and loved America, that a man worth $50m and a man worth $1b are "working men." That Republicans and social conservatives want to give all wealth to a few, while watching the rest starve, I guess.   Sigh.  Well, it is sad to see some many people who are a) this fanatical, b) this hateful and c) this dellusional.  I realize they want to win.  I realize that, as a party dominated by lawyers, they feel that bad because they were not able to "game" the legal system in Florida to produce the results they wanted.  I realize that they can't accept that the decline in the economy, the problems with the military, the erosion of security and the growth of the menace of Al Qaeda that would eventually bare fruit in the carnage of 9/11 happened under their watch and that this Administration has done an okay job of cleaning up their mess (and yes, mistakes have been made, some unavoidable or unforseeable, others really boneheaded and worthy of opprobrium).  I realize that emotion and rancor are easier and more satisfying then rationality and a sense of shared burdens and goals. But, for anyone reading who agrees with the quotes above and the many more like them, I must say, you scare me.  These are the words of people like Al Qaeda, who view what should be a contest of ideas among people who recognize a kinship to one another, instread as a manichean struggle to create a golden world by vanquishing their foes (and no, I am not saying Democrats of this mindset are sympathetic to Al Qaeda or terrorists.  I am saying they have the same uncompromising worldview, one in which their opponents - like me - are evil).  The American system cannot survive if we become a nation of ideological fanatics.  And, unfortunately, the "hate Bush and conservatives" crowd are just that.  Unless they realize this and try to temper their views, they will be as much a danger to the Republic as any group of Muslim extremists.

      Okay, not to pick on any one person too much, but Moore was on O'Reilly last night and had a few choice things to say.  First, he insisted the President lied about pre-war intelligence (that is, he knew that the WMD programs had been suspended years ago).  Assuming that the Senate and the Butler Commission reports are accurate, this is not the case.  It is the case that the intel upon which the President's decision were made was faulty.  But that does not make those decision wrong, nor does it make the President a liar.  Unless Moore believes that the various reports out there are in error or that the President has special powers of clairvoyance that he has failed to disclose, he was making decisions on what knowledge he had.  By his insistence Moore demonstrates a lack of knowledge of how the intel community operates and how decisions are made at the Presidential level.  This is the best the Dems can do?  Second, there was this exchange:   O'REILLY: All right, you would not have removed the Taliban. You would not have removed that government?  MOORE: No, unless it is a threat to us.  O'REILLY: Any government? Hitler, in Germany, not a threat to us the beginning but over there executing people all day long  you would have let him go?  MOORE: Thats not true. Hitler with Japan, attacked the United States.  O'REILLY: From '33 until '41, he wasnt an imminent threat to the United States.  MOORE: Theres a lot of things we should have done.  O'REILLY: You wouldnt have removed him.  MOORE: I wouldnt have even allowed him to come to power.  O'REILLY: That was a preemption from Michael Moore. You would have invaded.  MOORE: If wed done our job, you want to get into to talking about what happened before WWI, whoa, Im trying to stop this war right now.   Okay, first, it's World War Two, Moore, not World War One.  Hard to miss the difference.  And, second, his expected statement about not letting Hitler come to power, shows the hypocrisy of the "no pre-emptive" war mindset.  When faced with a generally acknowleged evil like Adolf Hitler, suddenly everyone is ready to go to retro-active war.  When faced with a contemporary evil like Hussein they change their tune to "give peace a chance."  Sorry, but if you think we should not have gone to war with Iraq, then you cannot say that we should have gone to war with Germany before '41 or that we should interfered in German politics in the '30s.  Moore and all the other "no pre-emption" people have to acknowledge the implications of their stance.  And, finally, this exchange:   MOORE: So, you would sacrifice your child to secure Fallujah? I want to hear you say that.  O'REILLY: I would sacrifice myself..  MOORE: Your child? Its Bush sending the children there.  O'REILLY: I would sacrifice myself.  MOORE: You and I dont go to war, because were too old  O'REILLY: Because if we back down, there will be more deaths and you know it.  MOORE: Say, I, Bill OReilly, would sacrifice my child to secure Fallujah.  O'REILLY: Im not going to say what you say, youre a, thats ridiculous  MOORE: You dont believe that. Why should Bush sacrifice the children of people across America for this?   Of course, the military is not made up of "children."  The military, for the benefit of people like Moore, is made up of adults who volunteered for service.  It is not O'Reilly's decision to "sacrifice" his offspring.  It is those adults who have the choice to join the military or not.  It is understandable, given the Leftist elite mindset - in which we are all just serfs, waiting for our wealthy betters in Hollywood, the halls of academia or the salons of New York and DC to tell us what to do - that he would not realize this.  To him and people like him, the idea that people can make up their own minds and live with the consequences of their own choices is alien.  Now, does anyone want to see their offspring, the neighbor, their friend or relative, their fellow country-man die?  No.  But that does not mean that we can avoid those situations.  We did not want to wake up on 9/12 and realize that the preceding day had not been a nightmare.  We did not want to live in a world where we are targets of murder on mass-scale, when fanatics fueled by belief in a god that they believe delights in carnage are convinced that only our deaths or our enslavement to their beliefs is acceptable.  We did not want to live in a world where people are oppressed and murdered because they worship the wrong god or belong to the wrong village or have the wrong skin color or are the wrong sex; but we do.  So, maybe Moore and others like him should leave the cradle behind, grow up and see the world for what it is, not for what their rich, pampered lifestyle allows them to pretend it is.   Okay, no more Moore.  At least for today.  Oh, if you want to read the transcript, go to  urlLink Fox News .

      From what I've read, Moore is being greeted at DemCon04 like the messiah, his film F9/11 the new Bible, it's presumed effects on the election, a given.  So, I decided to run the numbers and see just how many people could have seen this movie, in order to gauge the impact it would have if the election were held today.  The average price of a movie ticket in the US is a little over 6 dollars (although, since F9/11 is still first run and in urban areas, this average could be pushed higher, but I'll leave it at 6).  I divided the total sales as of last weekend by this figure, at came up with a bit over 17 million.  While many of these are probably repeat viewers, I'll assume that each is a discrete person.  Further, I'll assume that all are of voting age and are eligible to vote (again, not likely, but this is a 5 minute exercise, not a 30 page research paper).  Take that 17 million and compare it to the over 217 million people of voting age in the United States.  That comes out to a bit under 8%.  So, given that in group of voters, over half of the voting age population doesn't even show up and there is no reason to expect that filmgoers are any more likely to vote than anyone else, this means about 8.5m people that will actually go to the polls have the potential of having seen the film (once we factor in higher average ticket costs, repeat viewings, people coming away from the movie not convinced that Bush is the devil, those who went to see the movie already committed to voting against Bush and ineligible voters this will go down, I believe substantially) one can see that, despite the hype and the annointment of Moore, the numbers are pretty small.  So, the effect on the election is likely to be on the margins.  Of course, in tight elections (like this one could well be) those margins can be of critical importance.  So, does the success of this movie demonstrate a vast anti-Bush groundswell?  No, I don't see how anyone can believe that, given what the numbers.  However, if it inspires even a few Dems who otherwise would have sat this one out to go to the polls, then it could still have a negative effect on the President's chances.   And, yes, I have too much time on my hands.

      (From the  urlLink Washington Post .) The Justice Department has issued a 42-count indictment against the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development (essentially closed down since 2001), the largest Muslim charity in the US, alleging that it was funneling money to the Hamas terrorist organization.  Lawyers for the Foundation are, of course, denying everything.   Groups like Holy Land, however, have long been operating in America, sending money to Palestinian terror groups or using funds for civic projects in the name of those groups, building good will and winning "hearts and minds."  While this is an good step forward on our part, there are still many other "charities," organizations and Islammic schools operating in the US that are providing support to our enemies, whether through their words or more substantially.  Until we remove the threat at home, the fight outside of the country can never be fully won.

      One of my readers made a following comment in response to my statement made earlier that "[f]or the average Democrat, who is intellectually lazy, who is interested only in slogans, not in actually doing his or her homework, Clinton sounds great."  His response to this was   Calling "average" Democrats intellectually lazy is _not_ cool. You don't see me doing that to average Republicans. Attack the points raised in the debate, but don't ever dismiss the people who hold these beliefs. It's simply not constructive.   Actually, I think it is accurate to say that the average Democrat is intellectually lazy. I think it would also be fair to say that the average Republican is intellectually lazy. I think that both statements are accurate because I believe most  people  are intellectually lazy.  I will modify my original statement since it obviously gives the impression that this is a problem only with Democrats. It is not. But, while it may not be 'cool' to say most people have very little awareness or interest of anything beyond a very narrow scope of issues that deal directly with their day-to-day existence, I think it is accurate. Many people seem to revel in their ignorance, the kind of people who never read the paper, question why people write, read or comment on sites like this, people who participate in news groups or write letters to the editor or whatever mode of expression you choose.  They have little understanding of the world around them (polls of general knowledge among American have been dismal for some time).  It is not that people are stupid, generally.  It is just that they are lazy and ignorant and our mass culture does not value knowledge beyond that which narrowly helps one's career or is immediately applicable to one's private life. A recent NEA study demonstrated a steadily declining number of adults who read or, if they do, who read outside of a very narrow range of topics (the report can be found  urlLink here ). So, in summation, I think I was quite justified in my criticism; however, I think it was reasonable to call for clarification. When the GOP convention rolls around and the good Republicans from Red America are hooting and hollering at whatever drivel is being spewed at them, I'll be certain to be just as critical.

      I'm listening to the Washington Journal and some Republican (self-identified) just called up and said Kerry joined the Navy to avoid the draft, like this was a mark against him.  Hey, he went and had people shooting at him for months.  Sorry, but there is nothing one could say that can detract from that.  It doesn't make him any more qualified for the job of President, but people should not be critical of the rationale behind his service or the particulars.  People have been critical of one of his Purple Hearts (that it was for a scratch).  You know, maybe it wasn't "deserved" but I don't care, he could have easily been killed during his time in Vietnam.  So, let's just say "good show" as far as his service in Vietnam is concerned and move on to what his record has been in Congress and the statements he has made, both now and during his career.

      Well, some of the heavy hitters were up last night at the DemCon.  Al Gore started off by talking about how the election was stolen from him (oh, he was joking, of course).  Over and over and over again.  Okay, we get it, you have an infantile obsession with being accepted and loved by your dead father.  Whatever.  He also was repeating the charge that the rapid job growth isn't good enough, without citing any evidence that all the jobs created are worse than all the jobs lost - mainly because if you look at the numbers, this proves false.  He also ignores 9/11 and its effects on the economy.  And, of course, he essentially says that those nations with us in Iraq are not allies.  Our only allies, according to Gore, are those that do not support us.  This is a bizarre way of looking at things, even for someone like Gore.  And, he ends up sucking up to Clinton, the man he didn't want to see on the campaign trail with him...what a sad, pathetic man.  To see someone so obviously consumed by failure almost elicits a feeling of pity.  Carter starts by claiming that military service is necessary for President, that only in that way can you make decisions that could take the country to war.  Since when is this supposed to be a nation run by a military elite?  He thinks America should not act unilaterally and he claims that the US was unified throughout the Cold War.  What?  This failure came close to losing the War to the Russians through his idiotic policies, his weakness at home and abroad and it took Republicans like Reagan to fix the damage he did.  And, he has the temerity to mention the problems in North Korea, when he was instrumental in setting up conditions that allowed that crisis to develop.  Ah, I could go on, but the whole speech demonstrates just how naive - if you want to be charitable - or ignorant he actually is.  He was a disaster as President; every time he tries to play the role of statesman, he merely reinforces this conclusion.  Ah, and Clinton.  Well, for the Dem faithful, he is Jesus Christ, Jim Morrison, JFK and Hugh Hefner rolled into one.  Good for them.  On our side, we had Ronald Reagan, the victor of the Cold War and one of the most honorable men to ever hold office.  So, they need their heroes too.  So, Bill starts by echoing the "we wuz robbed in 2000" charge.  Yawn.  Well, at least he got right to playing the class warfare card, saying that Republicans want to concentrate wealth in the hands of the few, while leaving most impoverished.  Nice.  So much for his claims moments before of not want to divide America or demonize the opposition.  Oh, and he also has the balls to condemn the Administrations withdrawal from Kyoto and ICC, two treaties he refused to send to the Senate for ratification.  Idiot.  Also, he attacks the tax cuts.  Well, coming from a rich man like him, his criticism of the tax cuts irks me, since I have seen more money every paycheck.  Guess what, for those who are not rich, every dollar counts.  So, if his extra money is a burden, he can send it back to the IRS.  Clinton goes on like this, trying to blame all of the worlds problems on the Adminsitration, which , in his view, was presented witha world of peace, harmony and plenty thanks to his Administration and then screwed it up.  In spite of what many say, he isn't very clever; he's just loud, has no sense of the truth and has the sociopath's trait of  believing  the lie.  And that is his strength.  He can convince himself of the truth of whatever he says.  For the average Democrat, who is intellectually lazy, who is interested only in slogans, not in actually doing his or her homework, Clinton sounds great, because his message is "you (whoever is a follower) are good, the others are bad" and he says it with such conviction, that, for the dullards who follow him, it becomes an unassailable truth.  Facts don't matter when you have faith and this is what the cheering Dems on the convention floor have; blind, fanatical faith.    In fact, this is what all three speakers resemble: religious fanatics.  While they may claim that the zealots are in the White House, listening to Carter, Gore and Clinton shows where the real fanatics are.  I found nothing redeeming in these three speeches; but, they were meant to stir up the party faithful, not have anything to do with reality.  Further, Gore's was all about, once again, pulling out his wounded pride, Clinton's, as usual, was another opportunity to have people on their knees before him, and Carter's...well, who knows what Carter is thinking (assuming he is).  So, we'll see what Kerry has to say.  hopefully, he'll be a bit more substantial than these three.

      John Kerry just said that we need to build a "true global alliance" to fight terrorism.  Well, while the British, Japanese, Italians, Polish, etc., can defend themselves, I think it is irresponsible for someone who would like to be the President to show such disrespect to our allies, allies who are sticking with us even though the struggle is difficult.  Once again, Kerry shows why he is unfit for office;  if this is how he refers to nations that help us, imagine what he might do to those that do not.  Kerry needs to think before he opens his mouth.

      Cynthia McKinney, former Congresswomen from the Peach State is back, having won the Democratic primary (I guess she was re-Peached...or not).  That this ultra-Leftist nutjob could win the primary shows just how dense many Democrats are.  The McKinney record includes:    Endorsing the view that the Administration knew 9/11 was going to take place and let it happen so the Carlysle Group could turn a profit   Begging a Saudi prince - Alwaleed bin Talal - for money, even after he essentially said 9/11 was all because of American support for Israel.  This is the same prince who offered $10m to NYC, an offer that Giuliani declined after the Prince made his anti-Israeli remarks   Her campaign financing - both in this election and in previous - has been chock full of donors ho represent extremist Islamic groups.  In fact, some 95% of her funding in this race comes from outside her district (according to the Economist).  She refuses to condemn big contributors like Abdurahman Alamoudi (a founder of the American Muslim Council), who after 9/11 at a pro-Palestine rally said,"[w]e are all supporters of Hamas... I wish they had added that I was also a supporter of Hezbollah."   She has come out in praise of the deposed Haitian leader Jean Bertrand Aristide, in spite of his unsavory record on human rights.   She has accused the Republicans of murdering JFK, MLK, RFK and Malcolm X. "George Bush smirks at us and our Vice President sneers. The smirk is for what they still have up their sleeves and the sneer is because they know we'll let them get away with it. After all, we let them get away with it in 1963 (that's when John Kennedy's life was taken), and again in 1965 (when Malcolm X was murdered), then twice again in 1968 (when snipers' bullets stole Martin and Bobby from us)."    This could go on and on.  But, I think you get the point.  She is a perfect example of what has happened to the Left wing of Democratic Party.  They are so angry at a country and a world that has left them behind that they will indulge the most ludicrous fantasies, adhere to the most repulsive ideologies and consort with the most repellent characters in order to explain their loss of power.

      Well, the Senator and his Heiress both had a few things to say over the last few days.  First, Senator Kerry talking to Peter Jennings:    Jennings: "If you believe life begins at conception, is even a first trimester abortion not murder?"  Kerry: "No, because it's not a form of life that takes personhood in the terms that we have judged it to be in the past."   Um, what?  If we are to believe his comments of earlier this month, that he thinks life begins at conception (which I don't believe; I think he said that because he was in the Midwest and was trying to bolster his crossover appeal), then his answer makes no sense.  If it is not a person, then what is it?  You can, of course, think that it is not a person, but then his statements about what he claims to believe are not consistent. Okay, so, Kerry is a two-faced (or, in his case, an  n -faced) dolt.  How about his wife, the Heiress (and, before I continue, let me express my admiration for someone who can sleep her way into a fortune...which actually applies to both the Kerrys)? She was at a function in Pennsylvania, when, while being critical of the tone of the campaign, she said,"We need to turn back some of the creeping, un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics." She was then asked by Colin McNickle, the editorial page editor of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review) what she meant by un-American.  She claimed that she had never said such a thing (even though she just had) and then, when McNickle persisted in his questioning, told him to "shove it."  Well, to all those who were critical of Cheney's past-time suggestion to Senator Leahy a few weeks ago, where's the outrage over this?  Shouldn't a prospective First Lady be a bit more, well, lady like?

      Over the course of the last year, I've gone back and forth about whether or not to vote for Bush.  While I would never vote for John Kerry, the Bush Administration has been wrong on a number of issues (the steel tariff, prescription drug benefits, keeping Tenet and Powell around, the complete mess we've made of post-war policy in Iraq, the time wasted on gay marriage, etc).  However, as Kerry put it at a speech in Colorado:   Everything is on the line. Our health care is on the line.  Our jobs are on the line.  Our children's futures are on the line.  The Supreme Court of the United States is on the line. America's role in the world is on the line.    You know, he is absolutely right.  So, this year, when the Democrats have a ticket that would do immeasurable damage on all of this fronts, neither I nor any other American who is concerned about the future can afford to stand on principle and a distaste for some of the Bush Administration's policies.  So, thanks for putting it so succinctly, Senator Kerry; you've made it a certainty that I'm voting for Bush.

      NATO has announced they will send two more battalions to Afghanistan (1 Italian, 1 Spanish) to help with security during the upcoming elections.  France had argued against deploying troops, since the Italian unit was attached to NATO's fledgling Response Force and the NRF has yet to be formally activated.  Their argument was that the NRF wasn't ready for activation and shouldn't be used to fill in troop shortages elsewhere.  Okay, but the Italian unit obviously  is  ready for deployment.  They were detached from the NRF and seem to be capable of deployment on their own.  So, what exactly was the problem?  It could be French reluctance to help the US.  It could be the desire to avoid having any of their assets in the NRF drawn in to Afghanistan.  Or, it could be a reasonable disagreement on the suitability of the NRF for this kind of mission.  And France has been reluctant to help with "out-of-area" missions.   Well, whatever the reason for France's reluctance, at least the Italians and Spanish are willing to help.

      Thanks to the cowardly and idiotic decision of the Philippines to run from Iraq, the various groups of insurgents were encouraged to take more hostages.  Now, they have seized the third-ranking Egyptian diplomat in the Iraq.  The insurgent group,  The Lions of God Battalions  (one has to assume that sounds more impressive in Arabic), is demanding that Egypt not cooperate with US forces in the country.  Egypt, which is the recipient of billions in US aid a year, had expressed interest earlier this week in helping the interim government with counter-terrorism in some way.  Once again, for anyone who ever doubted it, this is ample proof of why you do not give in to terrorists.  Further, it makes it crucial that the Philippines be punished in public for their actions.

      I'd like to start with my own narrative from that day.  As an employee of The Man working on the Hill, I was being a busy little beaver, doing computer type things.  I was just heading out for some coffee when the first plane hit.  The initial reports were of a small plane hitting and, from the video I saw, it was hard to tell how much damage had actually been done.  So, I called my folks (who were on vaycay in Chicago) and checked on the status on my Aunt who works in lower Manhattan.  She was fine, stranded in Detroit.  By the time I got back, the second plane had hit.  It was obvious that we were under attack and we began to initiate the emergency evac procedures we had.  While this was going on, the Pentagon was struck.  I rounded up a co-worker who lived in Northern Virginia and we hiked out of the city, making are way down the Potomac, with the smoke from the Pentagon scrawling a long dark line in the sky.  While walking home, I managed to make certain my GOP Baby was on her way home, on foot (I assumed that there would be attacks on the Metro) checked in with the parents (by this time on a train back home) and assured them that the reports of car bombs at the Capitol and Foggy Bottom were erroneous.  The walk was uneventful and I spent the rest of the day watching the horror unfold on TV.  As to the report.  Chapter one begins with a recounting of the events of the day, in detail.  The only comment is that it is distressing that some of the hijackers should have been stopped or at least more closely scrutinized. One didn't have a photo ID.  Others were subjected to what the Commission deemed were inadequate scrutiny at security checkpoints.  Oh, and the heroic actions of the Flight 93 passenger are amazing.  I don't think any American can read that section and not feel pride in the actions of his or her countrymen. The chapter continues with an examination of the FAA and NORAD c3 systems.  It is amazing that there were only 14 fighters on alert that day to defend all of North America.  Another "benefit" of the peace dividend. The system for communication between civilian and military agencies was inadequate and stupid mistakes were made (like one FAA regional center trying to contact a defunct NORAD alert site).  It took almost half-an-hour after the first signs of trouble for the military to be even notified.  The military was only informed about the plane that would crash into the Pentagon minutes before the event.  One thing that is clear is the NORAD never had a chance to stop any of the planes.   In the discussion of the decision making process in the Federal Government that day, it becomes clear that communications were spotty, due to the surprise of the attack.  One distressing thing: after the President authorized Air Force interceptors to shoot down hostile aircraft, the NEADS (North East Air defense Sector) commander failed to pass this order on to aircraft under his control.  Meanwhile, other aircraft launched by a commander not under NORAD control had weapons free authorization, essentially free-fire orders.  However, by the time they were over DC, Flight 93 would already have crashed into the city and the Commission, give the lack of orders to those aircraft over the city, is not sanguine about the chances of 93 being intercepted. Chapter 2 is a history of the development of terrorism and Al Qaeda in the 90s.  First, it is clear that we should have taken action against Al Qaeda in the 90s  based only on what we knew then .  This chapter outlines the various statements, plots and attacks carried out against the United States by Bin Laden.  It also makes it clear that there were contacts and negotiations between Bin Laden and Iraq, but that there was no evidence that these ever resulted in operational cooperation. The Commission also draws connections between Bin Laden and the ISI, Pakistan's formerly pro-Taliban intelligence service.  Finally, it makes it crystal clear that there will be no negotiations or accommodations with the threat from radical Islamic groups like Al Qaeda; they will only stop when we are all dead or Muslim.  More later....

       urlLink Michelle Malkin  has more followup on the story from last week about a flight Detroit to LA in which a large group of Arab men behaved in an odd and frightening fashion ( urlLink go here for my comments ).  Apparently, the men  were all members of a Syrian band and all may have been here on expired visas.  It is possible that they were here on expired visas, but not have overstayed their welcome legally (for more on the visa laws, check out the  urlLink State Department US Visa regulations page ).  Still, it makes an already disturbing story a little more so. The real problem is that bits and pieces are coming out and as far as I can tell there has been no official confirmation or denial from the Feds.  Shouldn't Homeland Security be all over this, allaying our fears?

      At least as far as the US House of Reps is concerned.  Here's the text of the resolution passed this morning calling the butchery there genocide and calling for action, either through the UN or on our own.   Declaring genocide in Darfur, Sudan.   Whereas Article 1 of the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide states that `the contracting parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish';   Whereas Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide declares that `in the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) killing members of the group; (b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; and (e) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group';   Whereas Article 3 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide affirms that the `following acts shall be punishable: (a) genocide; (b) conspiracy to commit genocide; (c) direct and public incitement to commit genocide; (d) attempt to committed genocide; and (e) complicit in genocide';   Whereas in Darfur, Sudan, an estimated 30,000 innocent civilians have been brutally murdered, more than 130,000 people have been forced from their homes and have fled to neighboring Chad, and more than 1,000,000 people have been internally displaced; and   Whereas in March 2004 the United Nations Resident Humanitarian Coordinator stated: `[T]he war in Darfur started off in a small way last year but it has progressively gotten worse. A predominant feature of this is that the brunt is being borne by civilians. This includes vulnerable women and children . . . The violence in Darfur appears to be particularly directed at a specific group based on their ethnic identity and appears to be systemized.': Now, therefore, be it    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That Congress--  (1) declares that the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide;  (2) reminds the international community, including the United States Government, of their international legal obligations, as affirmed in the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;  (3) urges the Bush Administration to call the atrocities being committed in Darfur, Sudan by its rightful name: `genocide';  (4) calls on the Bush Administration to lead an international effort to prevent genocide in Darfur, Sudan;  (5) urges the Bush Administration to seriously consider multilateral or even unilateral intervention to prevent genocide should the United Nations Security Council fail to act;  (6) demands that the Bush Administration impose targeted sanctions, including visa bans and the freezing of assets of the National Congress and affiliated business and individuals directly responsible for the atrocities in Darfur, Sudan; and  (7) calls on USAID to establish a Darfur Resettlement, Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction Fund so that those driven off their land may return and begin to rebuild their communities.   Although it remains to be seen if anything concrete will happen - the UN is sending another fact finding team there, as if there was any doubt about what was going on - at least this is a little more pressure on the Admin and the world to act.

       urlLink The National Committee of La Raza , for those who don't know, is a group that bills itself as "the largest national constituency-based Hispanic organization" in America.  Yesterday, the President of this group, Raul Yzaguirre, made some interesting comments after the introduction of a bill before the Committee on House Administration regarding the need for a Hispanic Museum on the Mall.  This might be a good thing, if for no other reason than it may help Yzaguirre learn a bit of history, rather than the tripe he was spewing his statement.   For example, when giving a reason why America needs this particular racially based museum he states   All Americans should know that the young man selling oranges by the freeway, the woman who cleaned their hotel room this morning, the family who opened up the new restaurant in their neighborhood, and the man who could be their next United States Senator all trace their heritage to peoples and cultures whose scientific, mathematical, and artistic contributions still leave todays scientists and mathematicians in awe. For example, the Mayans, the ancestors to todays Central Americans, invented the concept of zero, without which we would not have any of the technology, such as computers, that makes life in the 21st century possible.   Of all the examples he could give, this is the one of the worst.  While it is true that the Mayans did have the concept of zero, it influenced no one.  Poor Mr. Yzaguirre seems to think that when the Europeans arrived in the Americas, they took zero from the Mayans.  Of course, Mayan civilization had been dead for at least 500 years and the Europeans actually imported the concept of zero from the East (from India through the Islamic world).  So, no, the Mayans were not responsible for technological civilization.  See, in the new museum, we could have a display that would explain things like that to people like Yzaguirre.   But, he is not content to join the von Daniken school of history.  He also wants to protect the self-esteem of "the children."    It is damaging to the aspirations of Latino schoolchildren who come to Washington each and every year and see and learn about other communities and other cultures, but never see anything that is reflective of themselves or their families.    Oh, so everything on the Mall is for me (since I'm a Mick-Kraut and, therefore, about as white as you can get).  Cool!   It's going to be real healthy for the "aspirations" of Latino children to be told "all this other stuff, other people did...you get one building."  If more exposure to "Hispanic" culture is the concern (and, by-the-by, I might be wrong, but the Native Americans, like the Mayans, are not Hispanics, so there wouldn't be any attempt to connect "Hispanic" culture to pre-contact Native Cultures, right? Don't bet on it.) then wouldn't it make more sense to integrate that into the existing Smithsonian system?   Instead of pursuing racialism...ah, who are we kidding, this is a group that refers to itself as "The Race" (La Raza), they're probably just waiting until they can buy their brown shirts in bulk...instead of pursuing racism, instead of trying to create a sense of separatness and division, shouldn't we be trying to integrate all citizens into a whole?  E Pluribus Unum, anyone?  We have not always lived up to our ideals, but groups like La Raza want to see the American project (eventually moving past distinctions of race and culture of origin) fail.  They want to see their own power expand.  And they want to see their "constituents" made as frustrated and envious as possible in order to achieve this.

      Democrats will undoubtedly look at a  urlLink new poll  from the Washington Post, showing support leaning heavily towards Kerry (a 60/30 split, with other 10 going Nader or undecided).  Views on issues generally favor the Dems (Bush only polls over 50% on his handling of the War on Terror), saying the Administration's policies on all issues are failing.   Of some long-term interest, and some good news for the GOP, are the number of Latino Dems who become Republicans (some 34% as opposed to 11% going the other way) and that more independents or Dems are defecting to Bush for the election, since only 18% of those polled identified themselves as Republicans.  So, while Dems start from a big advantage, inroads can and have been made. So, is this a problem for the President?  Well, he won with only 35% of the Latino vote in 2000, so it looks like he'll get about the same this year.  While it must be a bit disheartening - particularly since the GOP has undertaken some serious outreach towards the Hispanic community and because the B-C campaign was hoping to get at least 40% of the Latino vote - it might just mean a tighter election than Bush would have liked. What's the solution for the GOP?  Good question.  Dems will always be more willing to pander than Republicans (although this Administration has tried to outdo them, to little effect).  Appealing to religious and/or cultural values is one avenue to continue to explore.  And some of the problems this year are due things that are unique (the recession, the War in Iraq).  In fact, one positive (from the GOP point-of-view) way to look at the results is that, even with only moderate support for the Administration, with the economic hits the Hispanic community took during the recession and with the growing unpopularity of the Iraq War, it is actually a good sign that general support for the Administration and the GOP has not fallen.  While this may come across as wishful thinking, note that 21% of those who say they are voting for Kerry could change their votes for someone else - or, in my read, differing circumstances.

      Apparently, the answer is 'yes.'  According to the  urlLink National Review , Dean, back in 1983, while I was just entering high school, Dean was a legistator in Vermont, voting to allow an uncle to marry his niece (something Vermont law banned).  The law passed Vermont's House, but never made it to the floor of the Senate.   Okay, maybe there were special circumstances.  Maybe Howard was feeling unwell that day.  Maybe he had burst a blood vessel during some morning primal screaming.  Who knows.  But, I do have to say...Ewwww! Democrats really are strange.  I mean, I'm about as much of a personal liberties guy as you can get, but I do draw the line at uncles and nieces (or nephews for that matter) getting hitched.  Call me old fashioned but that just seems, well, wrong. Oh, and did I mention...Ewww!   So, Dean started to stake out the mutant Left (I doubt even many people I would consider mainstream Leftist would support this) early.  I bet all of those Deaniacs or Deanians or Deanites or whatever they called themselves are thanking whatever gods they worship for his Iowa meltdown.  Can't you just picture the Bush campaign ads that would be running today if Dean had gotten the nod?

      That is what the seven new hostages in Iraq should be saying.  A group calling itself Holders of the Black Banner has snagged three Indians, three Kenyans and one Egyptian, all truck drivers in Iraq, demanding that their home countries withdraw all support and all nationals from Iraq or else the hostages will be killed.   So, the surrender of the Philippines is having an immediate effect; providing the enemies of peace with hope.  More on this can be found at the  urlLink CBC Website .

      The  urlLink International Energy Agency  is projecting that the world's demand for oil will increase by 1.8 million barrels per day in 2005, a 28 percent slower pace than the increase of 2.5 million barrels per day projected for 2004, mainly because of slowing economic growth.  Great, the way to avoid an eventual energy crisis...economic stagnation and global poverty!  Okay, maybe not.  While it is good to hear that oil consumption will  increase  by a lower amount, that still does not change the fact that we (and by we, I mean the world) must shift away from fossil fuels to renewables or to expendables that are more abundant (like hydrogen) or more efficient (like nuke plants).

      The London Arabic-language daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat interviewed Iraqi Defense Minister Hazem Al-Sha'lan yesterday and he had some interesting things to say.  When asked if the Coalition shared intel with the Iraqis about terrorist cells operating in the country he responded "Never. We have received absolutely no information from any foreign party, or from the multinational force. We get our information, as I have stated, from our [own intelligence] apparatus, and from Iraqis with a sense of honor."  While true to some degree (the Iraqis are probably able to leverage indigenous resources that we never were able to) it is highly unlikely that they never receive intel from us or our allies.  It is a sign of just how unpopular we are in Iraq that a senior official in a government we created has to distance himself so much from the Coalition.  The really interesting part of the interview had to do with his assessment of who is penetrating the Iraqi borders are stirring up trouble.  He claimed that Iranian intelligence agents were in Iraq and that they were helping to bring insurgents in and funding them.  Further, he had this to say about measures that might be taken against Iran   [W]e confronted them with the facts and the evidence, but they have not taken any measures to stop their support of the terrorists and their operations on Iraqi soil. When we reached a dead end, we started to issue statements and we said, and I reiterate it here, that we have the capability to move [the response] to assaults on Iraqi dignity and rights into those countries. We have the capability to move the assault into their countries.   As far as who comprises the resistance, when asked   Do the [Iraqi] Ba'thists play a significant part in the terrorist operations?   His response was   Absolutely not. They started contacting us and cooperating with us particularly in the area erroneously called 'the Sunni triangle.' We have neither a Sunni nor a Shiite triangle.   Of course, this is for domestic consumption.  The Iraqi government wants to portray the country as unified behind them.  He was, on the whole, pretty dismissive of the Coalition and, while undoubtedly right about Iran and its interference in Iraq, the last thing the region needs is the less-than-firm Iraqi government making belligerent noises towards Iran.  Since our own policies are so muddled, however, it is uncertain that we'll be able to rein them in.

      Okay, lot's of ink and electrons have been spilled (do you really spill electrons?) about the de la Cruz crisis in Iraq.  Here's what the Philippine government has to say today about his release:    The hostage crisis involving overseas Filipino worker Angelo de la Cruz in Iraq is over.   An ecstatic President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo announced this to the media this afternoon while thanking the Lord Almighty that the crisis that shook the whole nation and tested the Filipino spirit has come to an end.  "I am happy to announce to the nation that our long national vigil involving Angelo dela Cruz is over," intoned the President as she confirmed the release of the Filipino OFW.  In a scene reminiscent of her reaction in the aftermath of the failed Oakwood mutiny, an elated President raised both her fists in triumph after talking to Dela Cruz following his release from the hands of his abductors in Iraq.  With the release, Malacanang officially ends the news blackout implemented to secure his safety and security.   The President said the government "has a deep national interest in the well-being" of over one million overseas Filipino workers in the Middle East and over eight million worldwide,   "I made a decision to bring our troops home a few days early in order to spare the life of Angelo. I do not regret that decision," she said.   She said every life is important. She noted that Angelo was spared, and "we rejoice." "We are all rewarded for it, particularly his loving family and friends. But our people must also know that that will not always be the case. Innocents will come into harms way, and circumstances may not allow such a successful outcome," she added.   The President said that the Filipino people and nation must remain true to its values and convictions here at home "while remaining committed to other friends and allies abroad."   "We must rejoice at the good news, but our happiness must be tempered by the awareness that we live in dangerous times, and that we must work to create a more peaceful world," she said.   In the press briefing, the President said that when Angelo arrives home, she would bring him to Our Lady of Rosales in Pangasinan, where she prayed for the safety of the Filipino hostage.   The President said the Filipino drivers health is good, his spirits high and, "he sends his best wishes to every Filipino for their thoughts and prayers."  In their conversation, Angelo assured the President that he is in good condition but the President advised him to undergo medical check-up in a hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE) where he will be brought from Baghdad before proceeding to Manila.  The President also talked to Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rafael Seguis who was with Angelo at the time of his release.  Seguis informed the President that the UAE government has extended all assistance in helping bring home Angelo to Manila.   For the original  urlLink go here     So, Arroyo thinks that by "bring[ing] our troops home a few days early" she remains "committed to other friends and allies abroad."  Which friends and allies?  Not us, apparently.  Also, which "values and convictions" are served by appeasing terrorists?  And don't the Filipinos realize that by giving in to the people who were going to murder de la Cruz they are not "work[ing] to create a more peaceful world" but rather make it more dangerous? I would gather not. And what kind of triumph is this for the Philippines, as the government would like to portray it?  Long times allies slighted, the new government in Iraq probably angered, the terrorists in the Philippines at least a little encouraged that this government can be bullied.  What's the up side, other than for Mr. de la Cruz and his family?  Maybe some domestic gain, but Arroyo has other issues to face, so the bounce from this will probably be short-term.  And, finally, this attempt to spin what at best was a poorly thought out decision into a positive victory will only make the break with the US and the Coalition that much the worse. Appeasing terrorists seems to be a policy you'd want to get past as quickly as you could with as little fanfare as possible.  But, hey, I'm just a geek for The Man.  What do I know?

      The French consulate in New York seems to think so.  An  urlLink article in the Washington Times  reports on a sign that has gone up on the front door of the consulate warning that:   Visas for France are not a right. Persons applying for visas are requested to show due respect for Consular personnel. Failure to do so will result in the denial of the application and denied entry into any of the EU countries.   Of course, no EU country, as far as I know, can deny a visa for other countries in the EU, only their own.  So, one first has to wonder about the caliber of the people that France is sending over here.  Second, why would you put up such a sign in a country that you depending on for trade on tourism (they sold us $30B and had 2.4m visitors from the US in 2003)?  Are they trying to worsen relations? Do they look for the snottiest, least diplomatic people they can find and dump them in NYC? Of course, President Chirac has said that the PM of Israel is no longer welcome in his country - at least until he makes up for comments about anti-Semitism in France made earlier this week - so, perhaps the consulate officers are just taking their cue from the top.

      Hashem Aghajari has been handed a five-year jail term following his re-trial.  He was sentenced to death in 2002 for criticizing the ruling mullahs, calling for reform, religious renewal and for saying that Muslims are not "monkeys" who "blindly follow" the clerics.  The revised sentence came after the original one was overturned by the Iranian Supreme Court, at the urgings of Ayatollah Khamenei, the leader of Iran, in order to defuse mass student demonstrations.

      The Philippines has completed its  urlLink retreat from Iraq .  We should keep this in mind the next that country is in trouble and needs our help.  Neither blood nor treasure should be expended for people who are not willing to stand by us. Of course, that is easier said than done.  Our interests are global; the Philippines only have internal and regional interests.  So, we will have to continue to expend money and lives to help the Philippines, while they capitulate to our foes.

      Sylvester Brown Jr. is a columnist with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  In an article entitled  urlLink Kudos to Bush for not playing nice with NAACP  Brown has a number of thoughtful things to say about the President's decision not to attend the NAACP conference.  Brown is no fan of Bush, saying "Lying about the war and allowing rich cronies to profit from its aftermath is reason enough to boot him back to private life."    But, as he points out, Bush had absolutely no reason to attend the meeting, given the avowed anti-Bush, anti-Republican stance of the NAACP.  While Brown cites Julian Bond's infamous attacks on the GOP as appealing "to the dark underside of American culture," of wanting to see the "American flag and the Confederate swastika flying side by side" and saying that Bush practices "racial division" one can also go back to the 2000 election, in which the NAACP accused Bush of creating an atmosphere in Texas that led to the murder of James Bird.    Brown goes to cite Bush's statement about why he is not attending ("You've heard the rhetoric and the names they've called me. I would describe my relationship with the current leadership as basically nonexistent.") and refer to it as:   [A] refreshing, nonpolitical response. Basically, the president said, "Hey, they don't like me. I don't like them. Why should I kiss up to an organization that opposes my party and my politics?"   That would be a legitimate question. Another question is why the NAACP leaders even expected Bush to attend their conference given the way they've treated him.     Exactly.  Brown then comments on Kerry's appearance writing:     Under his leadership, Kerry promised, the door would always be open for dialogue with black leaders and Democrats would respect and respond to the needs and issues of black voters.   What needs? What issues? Kerry made minor promises based on his assessment of black needs. He committed to nothing substantial because NAACP leaders demanded nothing of substance.     Exactly, again.  Prominent members of the black community (like Julian Bond and Kweisi Mfume) have over the years warned the Democrats not to take African-American support for granted.  But why not?  These "leaders" throw their support behind Dems reflexively.  Polls have shown that on many issues (cultural issues, issues of education, even broad economic issues) the mass of African-American voters is in synch with the basics of the GOP.  Simply put, blacks are more conservative than not.  If their "leaders" realized this, and used it to win GOP support for their causes, they would stand a better chance of success than they currently do, tied to a party that believes that all it need do is throw a few crumbs to the likes of the NAACP.    The Republican message of self-help, self-empowerment, traditional values, and personal choice tempered by self-control should be a winner.  It is only because of a leadership that is mired in the past and the message of dependence and victimhood that they spread, that it does not.  Until the black leadership is more willing to actually listen to the Republican Party and its message, why should the President waste his time?  (I found this article linked from  urlLink Midwest Conservative Journal )

      The GW National Security Archive has released a new document collection, detailing SIOP-62, one of America's&nbsp;earliest nuclear warfighting doctrines.&nbsp; These documents give an amazing insight into what American leaders of 40 years ago were thinking as they contemplated a war in which thousands of nuclear weapons&nbsp;would have been used against targets across the Communist Bloc.&nbsp; Some of the little tidbits are both interesting and sobering, like the assessment that three 80 kiloton devices would be used against a target city of the size of Nagasaki under the SIOP, a city that was leveled by a single 22 kiloton bomb at&nbsp;the of World War Two.&nbsp; Or the&nbsp;decision to assign 5 devices to&nbsp;each counterforce target, even as part of a retailiatory strike (this kind of overkill makes sense in a first strike, but employing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of devices against empty silos raised concerns even then.)&nbsp;  These days, as we contemplate a terrorist attack in which a few hundred - or in the case of 9/11 a few thousand - are killed, it is useful to remember what we faced only a few years ago; not random acts of murder, but a war which would have&nbsp;jeopardized the survival of mankind.&nbsp; The collection can be found at  urlLink http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB130/index.htm

      Michelle Malkin is reporting on what may have been  urlLink a dry run  for hijacking or bombing aboard a Northwest flight from Detroit to LA a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; The story was originally posted at  urlLink Women'sWallStreet.com  and details&nbsp;a harrowing experience the author had while flying to LA on&nbsp;June 29.&nbsp; Although some  urlLink commentors  have&nbsp;called into question the veracity of the story - which is fairly long, but basically recounts how&nbsp;between 6 and 14 Middle Eastern males on her flight were behaving in a manner she found suspicious and disturbing and how her fears that something was&nbsp;amiss were confirmed by one member of the flight crew and by the presence of Federal&nbsp;law enforcement upon landing - Malkin has spoken to both the author and a number of people in other media outlets who are familiar with the story&nbsp;and are pursuing it.  While it could still turn out to be innocent - perhaps an overactive imagination on the part of the article's author and other onboard the plane or even a hoax - it seems suspicious.&nbsp; With warnings out of a major attack taking place soon and with the known history of Al Qaeda staging dry runs of attacks, can we afford to just let this story die?&nbsp; Shouldn't someone be asking Tom Ridge what the heck is going on?&nbsp; And shouldn't we be looking at more robust methods of boosting security?&nbsp; Like not letting over a dozen males with Syrian passports fly on the same plane?&nbsp; Or not have rules that necessitate the expenditure of time and resources on people who do not fit threat profiles.&nbsp; While an 80 year old woman from Iowa might be an Al Qaeda operative, it is pretty unlikely.

      UN General Secretary Kofi Annan has valiented decided not to investigate charges of sexual harassment leveled against U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Ruud Lubbers, saying there was no evidence.&nbsp; Kofi wrote the following to the 6,000 employees of the UNHCR:    While I find that the complaint against Mr. Lubbers cannot be sustained, I have written to him conveying in the strongest terms my concerns about the incident which gave rise to the event and about subsequent events during the investigation, some of which may have been construed as likely to influence the course of the investigation.    Huh?&nbsp; If there isn't evidence of wrong doing, why admonish him?&nbsp; It's not like he was going to be put on trial by the UN.&nbsp; At worst, he would lose his job (and one would assume that you would want the head of UNHCR to be above reproach.&nbsp; Okay, it is the UN, so, maybe you wouldn't).&nbsp; So, if there is enough concern to tell all of his underlings that he wasn't behaving approipriately, why not proceed with more tangible action against him?&nbsp;  The UNHCR has suffered from various scandals over the years, including charges of  urlLink sexually exploiting children  in West Africa in 2002 &nbsp;and urlLink the trading of sex for food &nbsp;in UN refugee camps in the DRC just last month.&nbsp; One would think that the office of the Secretary General would not want a man in charge who has admitted making female subordinants feel "very uncomfortable" after&nbsp;making&nbsp; "friendly gesture[s]".  UN workers have been violating human rights for years and&nbsp;have not been held accountable.&nbsp; I guess it shouldn't be surprising that Annan&nbsp;finds nothing&nbsp;amiss when one of the senior members of the organization he runs is groping staffers.&nbsp;

      Okay, the Philippine government is&nbsp;cutting and running, but guess who's showing up for duty in Iraq?&nbsp; The Tongan Royal Marines.&nbsp; A group of&nbsp;  urlLink 45 Tongan Marines  is being sent to support operations by 1MarDiv.&nbsp; Good for them.&nbsp; While Tonga isn't exactly a "heavy hitter" in the world of global affairs (the country is only 4 times the size of DC, with a bit over 100,000 inhabitants) anyone who wants to pitch in is welcome.

      The following excerpts are from US Air Force press release.  The author - Capt. Sharon S. Thompson of the  48th Medical Operations Squadron  - is a nurse stationed in RAF Lakenheath and was deployed to Iraq.  The full article can be found  urlLink here .  However, there are a few parts that need to be read by everyone:   One night we received casualties from an ambush on a U.S. Army convoy. A rocket-propelled grenade struck a fuel truck in the midst of the convoy.   We were told the heroic story of our patient; how he did not jump from the burning vehicle to safety. Rather, he drove it into the desert away from the rest of the convoy for fear the vehicle would explode and cause further casualties. He sustained severe burns in the process and was hanging precariously onto life as we worked diligently to treat his injuries.   Another young man in his early 20s was brought in at the same time. He had sustained a gunshot wound through the abdomen. He received immediate surgery and was also in critical condition. But my feelings about these two patients were not the same. One I saw as a hero and the other as the enemy.   The second patient had been the one to launch the RPG at the convoy. He had been shot trying to flee.  Suddenly, I was faced with emotional barriers to my ability to care for this patient; barriers like anger, prejudice and fear. There was immediate anger as I looked at the severe burns and suffering he had caused.  My anger intensified as I looked into the faces of our Soldier’s wife and children in a picture as I inventoried his belongings. We waited anxiously for the Critical Care Air Transport team to arrive and take our hero to Germany to be delivered into the hands of specialists for treatment.  ...  We watched him, warily wondering what he might be thinking or planning. How could we overcome these emotional barriers? Why should we even try to truly “care” for him rather than just provide him the basic medical service he needed?   These answers go beyond just nursing, but rather are important lessons for all of us in uniform.  Doing the right thing is not contingent on others’ behaviors. Sometimes it is a long and lonely road. Seeing the shrapnel holes in our ambulances was enough evidence that our enemies weren’t following the Geneva Convention articles. But we are only accountable for our own actions. We hold ourselves to the highest standards  ...  Freedom isn’t free, it comes from great sacrifice. Thousands of our forefathers have given their lives for the freedoms we enjoy today. With these freedoms comes great responsibility. We continually honor those who have paid freedom’s price when we extend those freedoms to others who are under the crushing fist of oppression.  Embrace the core values -- integrity first, even when you think no one is looking; service before self, even when you find the assigned task surrounded by barriers. Most importantly, excellence in all we do. Do not give a half-hearted effort or mediocre performance to any task. When we fail to overcome these barriers or obey these laws, we start to unravel the very threads of democracy that weave our country together and make it strong.   Recent news reports and photos of alleged prisoner abuse have rocked our nation and the world. Our honor has been questioned.   Great work and sacrificial service is being overlooked as people’s focus has been drawn to these items like a few dirty spots on a clean white shirt. Suddenly we are being compared to the very terrorists we have vowed to defeat. Each of us must find the strength within ourselves to overcome these barriers of anger, prejudice and fear. Then we must reach out to our brothers in arms and help them as well. We are all accountable as a group.   ...  My husband and my son are both active duty, both having served in Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. I learned to care for my enemy patient the way I would want a nurse to care for my husband or son if the worst happened and they were found in the hands of the enemy. I would want that nurse to care for my family with respect and dignity.   How could I ask anything less of myself?     For all those who view America's soldiers as thugs and America as the threat to peace...for all those who think Abu Ghraib is the new face of the United States...for all those who are so blind that they equate America with the barbarians we are fighting...really read these excerpts, then the whole article and then reflect on what the enemies of civilization are doing in Darfur, Gaza, Fallujah, Waziristan and on hundreds of other battlefields across the globe.  We save the lives of injured terrorists; they murder helpless men, women and children.  We try to bring peace and order.  They have nothing to offer but violence and chaos.  We wish to spread prosperity and a better life for all.  They can only deliver misery.   In short, while life is generally made up of many shades of grey, some things are black and white.  This is one of them.

      The RNC has published  urlLink an overview  of John Edwards' career, particularly his views while in the Senate.  While undoubtedly skewed to show him in the worst possible light, it is a refreshing change from the media's fawning attitude towards him and his "youth," "energy," and "sexiness."  My favorite quote is from Kerry:   “‘I think the American people want an experienced hand at the helm of state,’ said Kerry, who has spent 19 years in the Senate compared with Edwards’ five. ‘This is not the time for on-the-job training in the White House on national security issues.’” (Mark Z. Barabak, “Diverse States May Reshape The Democratic Race Today,” Los Angeles Times, 2/3/04)   I guess John K. has decided that having someone who can actually smile and look convincing while doing it trumps his earlier concerns.

      The government of the Philippines has decided to capitulate to terrorist demands that they withdraw the handful of troops they have in Iraq immediately, rather than wait until the scheduled withdrawal date in August, in order to save the life of a Philippine national. Philippine Deputy Foreign Minister Rafael Sequis had this to say on  urlLink Al Jazeera  - "We are responding to your request and are to withdraw our humanitarian contingent in Iraq as soon as possible." Our government has expressed public disapproval - Richard Boucher made the following statement yesterday:    I would express once again the fact of our disappointment in that statement.  We think withdrawal sends the wrong signal, and that it is important for people  to stand up to terrorism, not allow them to change our behavior.  We certainly  have every sympathy for Mr. de la Cruz.  Unfortunately, we have no new  information on his status, on his situation right now.  But we continue to hold  that he needs to be released immediately and that these terrorists who have  captured him need to be found and punished.   Although we can be sympathetic to Mr. de la Cruz and his family, you have to wonder just how Philippine President Gloria Arroyo has managed to stick her head up her ass as far as this.  Wouldn't the best response to a terrorist attempt at national blackmail be one of strength?  Instead of running for the hills, the Philippine government should be announcing the extension of their tour of duty, the reinforcement of the forces there and their use in combat operations (if the Iraqi government requests such a role for them).  Make it clear that for every hostage taken, say, 500 more soldiers will be sent. The only way to demonstrate the futility of the terrorist tactics is to not give in to them.  The only way to make terrorists modify their behavior is to hit them harder then they hit you.  No, this response would not cause all the insurgents to just give up.  And yes, it would probably result in the death of the hostage.  But it also would have the likely effect of causing terrorist groups to use this particular tactic against the Philippines. US nationals have been killed by rebels in the Philippines; perhaps we should cut and run, rather than deploying US forces to aid in counter-insurgency work (both as trainers and fighters) and cut off aid, rather than spending $400m in the last few years, much of it for COINS operations. From now on, the government of the Philippines has  on their hands some of the blood of every foreign national seized as a hostage and killed by terrorists.  By capitulating to terrorists, the Philippine government has reinforced the notion that these barbaric tactics work.  Although it is on our best interests to surpress the Islamic terrorists and insurgents in the Philippines, we should never forget how our "ally" abandoned us and the people of Iraq.

      Okay, not yet.  But, the Post is carrying  urlLink this story  about the attorney general of Mexico who has had chip implanted in his arm that allows him to be tracked and which also broadcasts a signal that allows access to a high-security government facility.  While I think this is pretty neat, in discussions this morning with my GOP Baby (who spent a couple of glorious years in Mexico City while her parents were flunkies of The Man), a number of problems were raised.     Identity theft - If the chip is broadcasting personal information, couldn't someone with a receiver pick this signal up and spoof it?   Lack of Privacy - One of the uses mentioned would be to keep medical information about the implantee in  a format easily accessible by others (one presumes, medical professionals).  However, what guarantees that only appropriate people are using this information?  While I assume the info would be encrypted in some way, that is no guarantee of security.   Technology failure - What happens if the  readers  fail?  While there can be a manual backup (in this case, a traditional lock and key door that would be used if the automated, chip-dependent system failed) wouldn't this provide an obvious work around for those who wished to bypass the more secure system entirely?   And, of course, Arm Theft.    Still, while these are all concerns (except maybe that last one) it is a neat and useful technology.  Now, if they could only perfect one of those bionic eye like Major Steve Austin had (yep, as a child of the 70s I loved the  Six Million Dollar Man )...

      Supporters in the Senate of the Marriage Amendment (which states "`Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman.'.") were unable to muster the 60 votes needed to end debate and move to actual consideration of the Amendment.    Personally, I think the idea of amending the Constitution for something like this is asinine.  How about letting the states decide what to do, as they are?  How about addressing issues that directly threaten our existence as a nation (terrorism, Islamic-Fascist ideologies, uncontrolled immigration, environmental problems, etc.)?    Further, I have no problem with homosexual unions being recognized by the state.  But, at the same time, shouldn't our elected representatives have to do their job and vote on legislation?  This is an important issue to many of my fellow citizens and I assume they want to know what their Senators would do when the vote means something.  So, how about we stop screwing around with this procedural nonsense and bring the measure to the floor, for a vote?

      While I sit here waiting for some files to copy from one of The Man's computers to another, I thought I'd take a moment to point everyone in the direction of some interesting reading.    First, of course, is the Senate Intel Committee's report.  The main page is  urlLink here .  From this page you can chose the 30 conclusion or the 500 plus page report.  Both are PDF files.   After polishing that off, head to the UNAIDS site to read their  urlLink 2004 report  on the global epidemic.  Or, get the  urlLink Executive Summary .   Click  urlLink here  for the International Court of Justice's ruling on the Israeli West Bank Security Barrier.    That should keep you all busy for a little while.

      At least, he wants us to believe that Senator Tom Daschle (D SD) hugged him, something Daschle denies.  The story, from the Washington Post, follows:   Daschle denies hugging Michael Moore." We just can't resist passing along that headline from last week's Rapid City Journal in South Dakota. (A shame; we would have loved to see a picture.) The hubbub started after a Time magazine cover story said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle met the controversial filmmaker at "Fahrenheit 9/11's" Washington premiere. Moore's quote: "He gave me a hug and said he felt bad and that we were all gonna fight [Bush] from now on. I thanked him for being a good sport." Nuh-uh, says Daschle. "I know we senators all tend to look alike. But I arrived late, and I had to leave early for Senate votes. I didn't meet Mr. Moore," he told South Dakota reporters in a conference call. Moore's reps said he stands by his comment.    Although I'm not a big Dashcle fan, I do tend to believe him on this one.  I mean, given Moore's girth, could any human actually be physically capable of giving him a hug?

      Last week, Jay Rockefeller (D WV), accused Douglas Feith, the number three man at the Pentagon, of wrongdoing, essentially running an intel operation out of his office (he is undersecretary of Defense for Policy).  As the Senator said,"We've done a little bit of work on the Number-three guy in the Defense Department, Douglas Feith, part of his alleged efforts to run intelligence past the intelligence community altogether ... and was he running private intelligence failure, which is not lawful." The Pentagon, unlike the White House which seems to have decided not to directly challenge Rockefeller on this and other accusations made after the Senate Intel Committee's 9/11 report was released, has decided to take him on about this.  According to the  urlLink Washington Times , the Pentagon is demanding that if the Senator "[has] any evidence supporting the serious charge you floated during your press conference, you provide it to the department. If there is not evidence, then a retraction and apology would be appropriate."   About time someone stands up to the Democrats.  During the press conference, Rockefeller essentially said that, in spite of what the report said (a report he supported) the White House did pressure the intel community to change their conclusions (even if it was only, in the Senator's words, the "total ambiance of this cascade of ominous statements, which continued really up to the present, about what was going to happen or the relationship between Al Qaida and Iraq, Mohammed Atta and the rest of it." So, I guess we can assume that the Senator doesn't want the White House to say anything to the American people because of the "ambiance" that might be created.). He also claimed that   "There is simply no question that mistakes leading up to the war in Iraq rank among the most devastating losses and intelligence failures in the history of the nation. The fact is that the administration, at all levels -- and to some extent us -- used bad information to bolster its case for war. And we in Congress would not have authorized that war -- we would not have authorized that war with 75 votes if we knew what we know now.   Leading up to September 11, our government didn't connect the dots. In Iraq, we are even more culpable because the dots themselves never existed. Tragically, the intelligence failures set forth in this report will affect our national security for generations to come. Our credibility is diminished. Our standing in the world has never been lower. We have fostered a deep hatred of Americans in the Muslim world, and that will grow. As a direct consequence, our nation is more vulnerable today than ever before."     While it is impossible to argue that their were not mistakes made, both before 9/11 and before the War in Iraq, his claims that America is "more vulnerable today than ever before" is insane.  more vulnerable than when the Soviets had 20,000 nukes pointed at us?  More vulnerable than when the Axis was overrunning much of the world?  Move vulnerable than when Soviet nukes were in Cuba and one mistake could have led to a nuclear exchange?  Or, the crises we are only just learning about, like the 1983 Able Archer incident, when the Communists almost started World War 3 by mistake?  Or, how about before 9/11, when, after a decade of terror attacks overseas, people like Rockefeller did nothing that would have stopped the assaults on our country? And, he essentially blames Muslim hatred of America on this administration.  I must have dreamed of decades of anti-American and anti-Western attacks by Muslims across the globe. A memo leaked last year from Rockefeller's office made it clear that the Democratic strategy is to try and blame the Bush Administration for everything wrong with the US intelligence community.  That the actual findings of the report he voted for didn't matter because "when it becomes clear we have exhausted the opportunity to usefully collaborate with the majority...[w]e can pull the trigger on an independent investigation of the administration's use of intelligence at any time, but we can only do so once. The best time to do so will probably be next year [2004]."  So, the report, the recommendations for reform, the chance to build an intelligence community suited for the challenges of the 21st century, all this will be for naught, because Democrats want to score points against Bush.   As in years past, when Democrats undercut defense, gutted the intel agencies, worked against anti-Communists around the globe and lent aid and comfort to our ideological foes in the USSR, they now find themselves playing a similar role, focusing on partisan attacks at home, while ignoring the danger abroad.   I'm not saying that people like Rockefeller are traitors or that they support terrorism against the US; obviously, they are not and do not.  What I am saying is that they are so focused on a short-term political victory, that their ability to think in a long-term, global fashion is distorted.  Before the Senator thinks of blaming terrorism on the administration again, maybe he should think about who is carrying out that terrorism, who has been carrying it out for decades and how he can help his country defeat those forces of barbarism that threaten us all.

      The US Army, giving further indication of where the new strategic "weight" is going to be in Europe, is announcing the  urlLink first joint exercises in Bulgaria.   The operation - Bulwark 04 - will involve 900 U.S. soldiers from the Illinois National Guard and about 200 Bulgarian troops.  With the steadily increasing hostility from our allies in Western Europe, don't be surprised to see more and more operations like this one, culminating in the removal of US forces from Germany and their redeployment in Eastern and Southern Europe.  This will put them in nations friendlier to the United States, ones that have demonstrated a willingness to assist us in Iraq (Bulgaria has about 500 soldiers in country) and who remember what it was like to live under a dictatorial regime.  If Germany and France wish to have an antagonistic relationship, that is unfortunate; but more for them than for us.  Europe is facing demographic, ethnic and economic problems that would be easier to handle with active American help.  European interests oveseas rely on the order and security (such as it is) that America provides.  Europe has been able to maintain low levels of defense spending because the US has shoulder much of the military burden of the West.   The governments and people of those European states that seem to becoming hostile to the US, should think about the long-term costs of that hostility and whether or not they wish to pay them.

      The  urlLink Student Movement Coordination Committee for Democracy in Iran  is carrying the following story:   Millions of Iranians boycotted, today, government sponsored rallies against the war in Iraq and the fighting in Najaf. Most Iranians ignored repeated government requests, or demands from the regime's leaders and the Office of Islamic Propagation by staying home, or taking short trips using Friday to enjoy rather than sharing the concerns of the shaky theocracy.  The Islamic regime was only able to coerce limited numbers into the center Tehran streets and some main Iranian cities.  A few thousand and some smaller groups of professional demonstrators composed mainly of Bassij and foreign Islamists were all that the Mullahs could motivate to support their demands.  Last week the regime quietly let pass its' fiasco of not being able to successfully promote an earlier "popular" demonstration against U.S. led Coalition members that was also ignored by most Iranians.  Most Iranians are talking about how the Coalition forces and, especially US troops are crushing the Al-Mahdi and Badr Brigade troops, in Iraq; and, how they're eliminating some Iranian obstacles sought by the people reaching for its'  freedom.  A vast majority of them are wishing, publicly, to see Moghtada Al-Sadr and his Mullahs' sponsored zealots be totally eliminated in Iraq, so that Iran and the rest of the Middle East can see better days.    Assuming this is correct it is very good news.  It should not be interpreted as masses of pro-American Iranians; rather, I think it is more accurately viewed as Iranians who have lost all faith in their government and want to change.  They have experienced first had what an isolationist government of religious fanatics can do.  It is fairly obvious that many Iranians have decided this is not what they want for their country.  For us, that means the possibility of a true "people's movement" for change in Iran, one that would not have the taint of being an American supported minority.  We should continue to make it clear that a more reasonable, less hostile government in Tehran will find an America willing to welcome that ancient land back into the family of nations.

      I'm a supporter of gay marriages.  I wouldn't call myself a passionate supporter, since it doesn't effect me, except indirectly and, mostly, positively; I just see little reason for the states not to allow it.  However, I think the California Supreme Court was quite right in their ruling this week and the mayor of San Francisco not only wrong, but also demonstrating that he is unfit to hold office.  Why, you may ask?  The ruling held that the mayor had overstepped his authority and ignored state law by granting marriage licenses.  The mayor, Gavin Newsom, directly contravened state law and admitted doing so.  Mayor Newsom argued that, in his opinion, the law is unconstitutional and thus, can be ignored.  He therefore shows a lack of understanding of how the legal and political systems in the US work.    Elected officials can't just ignore state law because they don't like it.  Otherwise, we would have chaos.  Newsom, one assumes, is intelligent enough to realize this.  He must also have had a good idea that this ruling would be the outcome of his action.  And, thus, one is forced to conclude that he violated the law for political grandstanding and nothing else.  If a public official doesn't like a law, he has a number of options to try to change that law or to protest it.  The one act we should not tolerate is violating it; in doing so he violates the sacred trust that all public officials have with the polity they represent.  Newsom, by his actions, is no longer fit to hold office.

      As most people know, the Administration has been examining a redeployment of forces from their current bases in Germany and South Korea (and, in fact, have already begun to redeploy from South Korea).  It looks like details will be provided on Monday during a major speech at the annual VFW Conference.  Somewhere between 70K and 100K will be sent from bases in Germany, Japan and South Korea to Iraq, the States or into the new nations of NATO (Poland will probably be a major new deployment).  This redeployment will put our forces closer to the main field of battle these days (the Middle East and Central Asia) and will also be used to rebuild US strategic reserves.  It will also put them in countries friendlier to the United States and more amenable to allowing US training (forces in Germany have faced increasing restriction on how and where they can train). It will give us more influence over the states of Eastern Europe at a time when our main traditional ally in Central Europe (Germany) is becoming less cooperative.  Finally, it will allow us to close a large number of NATO bases in Germany that serve absolutely no purpose these days, except to enrich the German economy.   So, it is an all-around win for the US.

      Here are a few things going on today.      Ceasefire talks in Najaf, which opened yesterday, have already collapsed.  Good.  This is our opportunity to destroy one of the made nodes of Sadr's support and, possibly, capture of kill Sadr himself.  To have repeated the events of this Spring (when a successful offensive we were waging in Falluja was halted by a so-called ceasefire) would have only prolonged the problem that Sadr and the Mahdi Army represent.  Other reports are indicating that Iraqi forces are, again, performing poorly or not at all.   A  urlLink massacre is being reported  in Burundi.  Apparently, refugees fleeing the never-ending war in the DRC were staying in a  UN  refugee camp were massacred by a group from the Hutu Forces for National Liberation.  Once again, the UN has shown that it can't even protect people in the camps it has set up for that very purpose.  And this is the group that people on the Left want to give a veto over our foreign policy?   The McGreevey story has gone from the personally (for him and his family) painful to the publicly problematic for his remaining in office until November 15.  Golan Cipel is alleging that he was sexually harassed by McGreevey.  His lawyer also made it clear that there was "hush money" involved; it was being offered by the McGreevey Administration for his silence.   In this case, Republicans in New Jersey are right to ask for McGreevey's immediate resignation.  The best case scenario is that McGreevey is going to be trying to keep his name clean and will be unable to devote his energies to governing the state.  In the worst case scenario, he forced a subordinate into a sexual relationship, gave him a job a he was unqualified for and then helped him find work with political allies (suggesting an early attempt at payment for services rendered and for silence) and then tried to pay him to keep his mouth shut.  Either way, this has now gone beyond what are essentially private matters made public.  The NY Times has a good  urlLink article  about the whole mess. McGreevey wants to be seen as a stand-up guy who has had to repress his true self for his whole life and, consequently, made decision that were not in the best interests of him or his family.  Fine.  He should continue to display this concern for doing the right thing and step down now.    Okay, more will follow (bet you can't wait).

      In Nagpur, Maharahra State, India a group of women and children broke into a district court and knifed a rape suspect to death.  From the  urlLink BeeB :   Initial reports said about 14 women and several children forced their way into the courtroom and knifed the accused, Appu Yadav, to death. [...] Yadav was facing 24 counts of molestation and rape.   While I deplore lawlessness and vigilante justice, it is hard not to admire a group of women who are sick of taking abuse and degradation and get a little payback.

      It looks like Governor McGreevey had deeper reasons than just finding himself and feeling guilty for having an affair.  It looks like he was about to be blackmailed, by the guy he was sleeping with.  And, his bed buddy was a former government employee.  Further, this man Golan Cipel was New Jersey's homeland security advisor (I didn't even know state's had homeland security advisors) and his qualifications for the job amounted to his being an Israeli poet.  Maybe the governor liked his Longfellow (okay, that was both bad and obvious)?  Further, Cipel is tied in with at least one of the fundraisers currently under investigation for illegalities. What the governor admitted to yesterday was both embarrassing and morally suspect; however; what could be coming up might at the very least have been - and still be -  vulnerable to manipulation. Meanwhile, NJ Republicans are now calling for his immediate resignation.  If he had just decided to leave for personal reasons associated with his decision to pursue his gayness and the problems this, and his behavior, caused in his personal life, I would have said that they (the NJ GOP) were out of line.  Neither his sexuality nor his behavior towards his family matter, as far as his suitability to govern or his timing in leaving office. However, if these new allegations prove to be true (and they are only being put forward by "a senior McGreevey political advisor" (according to the  urlLink Post ) then it directly impacts on his ability to perform his job and he should continue to explore his new found maturity and step down now. If, on the other hand, this proves to be untrue, then the NJ GOP should just pipe down.

      McGreevey, after spending about 5 minutes talking in New Age generalities finally said he's resigning because he's gay and was having an affair.  Doh!  Guess wife number two is feeling pretty bad.  I can just imagine that conversation.  "Why couldn't you have a normal mid-life crisis and sleep with a 20 year blonde and buy a sports car?"   He said he'd resign on 15Nov04, allowing the President of the Senate to serve until 2006, rather than have a special election in 2005.  The worst part about his speech was that it took him 5 minutes to say "I like it in the rear and so, I'm outta here."  On and on about looking into his soul and finding his true path and always feeling he was apart and blah, blah, blah.  Just get over yourself.  Now we're going to be subjected to weeks on end of bleatings about how unfair it is for him to have had to have "lived a lie" all these years and how harsh society is, etc.  I can understand why he would want to take control of the situation and get everything out in the open and I can see why the whole affair thing would make him want to leave office (and how many out there think the fact that he decided to screw around on his wife will be slowly dropped to focus on how sad it is that his gayness made him resign).  I just thought it was fairly pathetic for him to turn this into a heroic struggle for his identity.  There is nothing noble about cheating on your wife and screwing up your family.

      At least, that's the story that CNN is carrying live.  John McGreevey, the Democratic governor, has been roughly handled - although not directly implicated - by investigations into widespread wrong-doing by his fundraisers.  Having only taken office in 2002, he saw his approval ratings plummet as the corruption investigations grew.  If he resigns, Richard Codey (D), President of the NJ Senate, will take over as acting governor.

      The US Marine Corps, assclown.    At any rate, that's my version of the assault just conducted on Muqtada al-Sadr's home in Najaf.  I assume that it actually involved considerable amounts of shooting and piles of dead jihadis.  With the our offensive progressing, Sadr militia forces will soon be reduced to those holed up in the Imam Ali Shrine.  Then we - or our Iraqi allies - just need to dig them out.  This will be a significant victory for us, particularly if we kill or capture Sadr (the media is reporting that he was not at home and is probably in the shrine).  We made a serious tactical mistake in accepting the spring ceasefire.  However, this time, it appears the Marines are going to be able to finish the job and cripple - if not destroy - Sadr's forces.

      Scientist in DC have addressed an age-old problem both here and abroad; lazy monkeys.  Yes, its true, your average monkey only works hard enough to ensure his survival.  But now, that can all change.  This from the  urlLink BeeB :   Monkeys are rather like people in their approach to work - at least, those who live in a laboratory and learn to press levers for rewards of food and water.   They concentrate on their task only when the moment of delivery approaches.   Researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health near Washington DC, led by Dr Barry Richmond, have now developed a genetic treatment which changes their work ethic markedly.   "Normal monkeys and people procrastinate - tend not to work very well when they have a lot of time to get the job done, and work better when the reward is nearer in time," Dr Richmond says.   "The monkeys under the influence of the treatment don't procrastinate."   The treatment consists of blocking an important brain chemical - dopamine.   After about 10 weeks it had worn off, and the monkeys were back to their usual unmotivated selves.   Dr Richmond believes treatments based on this concept could one day benefit people with conditions like depression, where motivation has largely disappeared from their lives.   But for the rest of us, the day when such treatments fall into the hands of our bosses may be one we would prefer to put off.    How long until the day when dopamine supressants are in the water cooler?  Or, how long until we are replaced by a race of uber-chimps?  Soon, we may all be able to say,"Take your stinking paws of off me, you damned, dirty ape!"

      At a speech today in Ohio, the VP is taking Kerry to task for calling a "more sensitive" war against terrorism.  Kerry's full statement at the Unity Conference was:   "I believe I can fight a more effective, more thoughtful, more strategic, more proactive, more sensitive war on terror that reaches out to other nations and brings them to our side and lives up to American values in history."   The Vice-President's response:   "America has been in too many wars for any of our wishes, but not a one of them was won by being sensitive.  A sensitive war will not destroy the evil men who killed 3,000 Americans. ... The men who beheaded Daniel Pearl and Paul Johnson will not be impressed by our sensitivity...President Lincoln and General Grant didn't wage sensitive wars. Nor did President Roosevelt or Generals Eisenhower and MacArthur."   While Kerry's statement is certainly more nuanced than Cheney makes it out to be, I would be interested in hearing what exactly Kerry meant by a "more sensitive war on terror."  Sensitive to whom?

      NASA has committed itself to saving Hubble. The plan, as of now, is to use a Canadian robot to carry out the necessary repairs.  You can read more at the  urlLink Guardian (UK) .  This is great news.  Hubble is one of NASA success stories and a significant tool for expanding human understanding of the universe.  To just have let it die would have been a blow to science.  Of course, we'll have to see how funding goes (NASA will need an estimated $1.6b).  But, there is public and Congressional support for this mission.  Hopefully that will translate into the necessary funds.

      Okay, I've beaten up on Mr. Keyes (I said my piece with  urlLink Don't Do It Alan , only it has moved from the realm of the hypothetical to that of reality) and the misbegotten idea of him running in Illinois.  Both  urlLink Jonah Goldberg  and  urlLink Mike Murphy  have a bit more on why Keyes' decision is a horrible one. In particular, Goldberg has this to say about the state of the American electoral system.   Except for the pesky fact that the Keyes candidacy is the latest example of a disturbing trend in which both parties are overturning the norms of democracy, with help from the media. Just in the last few years we've seen a dead man (dubiously) elected out of sympathy in Missouri, so that his widow could get a Senate seat as consolation. In New Jersey, Democrats were able to yank Bob Torricelli off the ballot after the deadline, knowing he would lose. In California, Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected governor because the voters wanted a do-over. In Texas, Republicans violate the longstanding tradition of redistricting only once a decade. And, of course, in 2000 Hillary Clinton won her vanity campaign in New York as a carpetbagger. And, while I think there's a lot of liberal myth-making about the Florida recount, there's no denying the event undermined many Americans' faith in the system.  Now, just as with the Keyes candidacy, each of these irregularities may be justified by no shortage of good arguments. But so what? That just demonstrates the political and cultural pressures driving efforts to rewrite the written and unwritten rules of our system.  The trends at work are complex and numerous. The cult of celebrity allows famous but unqualified candidates to drop into politics in ways that, say, scholars or economists cannot. Loopy campaign-finance rules encourage the super-rich to buy their offices, and weakened political parties are only too happy to serve as closing agents for the sale. Worse, consumer culture has infected civic culture. The push to make voting so convenient you can do it with a remote control exemplifies a growing tendency among voters to regard their "choices" as more important than their obligations. Indeed, for some reason, lots of people think it's imperative that criminals vote. Put your ear to the ground and you'll hear the bulldozer coming for the Electoral College.   I find it hard to disagree with his assessment. I would add that many of our elected officials - starting with the President - have demonstrated a shocking lack of understanding of what allows a system like ours to exist.  Every time that Bush makes the arguement that voting in Afghanistan and Iraq would mean a functional democracy, he undermines what democracy really means.  democracy is a set of shared values.  One manifestation of those shared values is the concept of citizen participation in the governing process, whether directly or through representatives.  But it is not the only that makes democracy work.  As we get closer to equating democracy with just occassional votes, we come closer to the day that those votes mean nothing.

      Well, not yet.  But he is the President's nominee and a good one at that.  A long-term servant of the people (Army intel, CIA,  urlLink Congress , chairman of the  urlLink Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ) he'll bring a lot of experience and political savee to the job (assuming he is confirmed).  Plus, he has already called Kerry's national security views "unrealistic and dangerously naive," demonstrating insightful judgement.  Here's hoping that we have a speedy and non-partisan confirmation hearing.

      Here are some interesting items from the last few days:    The UN is confident that it will stop the flare-up in polio in Africa stemming from the decision of Kano state in Nigeria to halt vaccinations.  The program - which was allowed to restart last month - has already immunized 58 of the children in that state as of the end of July.   Wow.  The Hubble team has sighted a galaxy 50mly away that is much like our own.  The spiral galaxy - dubbed NGC 3949 - is a vast disk of stars.  For more (including a great image) go  urlLink here .  It is unfortunate that the Hubble, an instrument that has provided amazing amounts of data, is being left to deteriorate.  Rather than expending resources on the Space Station, the first shuttle mission should be to rendezvous with and fix the Hubble.   Allen Keyes announced that he would run for the Senate against Barak Obama in Illinois. I think this is a bad idea for Mr. Keyes and a sad comment on the state of affairs for the Illinois GOP that they can't find anyone in state who can run.  For more go to  urlLink Fox News .

      Apparently, the State Department has requested that the OSCE send monitors to make certain the presidential elections are fair (are we to assume that Secretary of State Powell thinks those in 2000 were unfair?).  As the story on  urlLink CNN  makes clear, this is not the first time OSCE monitors have been in the US.  However, given that many Democrats think that the 2000 election was fraudulent (one would have to assume that, if they had any integrity that they would also have though that a Gore win in 2000 would have been fraudulent due to that campaign's initial attempt to have the courts circumvent the state legislature...oh wait, I forgot for a moment that I was talking about Leftists...my bad) this can only lead to problems.  The United States has managed to successfully hold elections for over 200 years.  No elections are perfect; fraud and error occur in many of them.  The losing party, particularly in a close race, is going to naturally feel like they were wronged.  But, in today's climate, when you have assclowns in Congress, like Eddie Bernice Johnson who headed up the push earlier this summer to get the UN involved in the elections, because she thought a coup had been staged (which if one had been, wouldn't she and other enemies of the state - that must be how a self-important, martyr wannabe sees herself - have been 'liquidated' immediately?  Gosh, the GOP can't even get their coup d'etats right...) having an international team here is almost an admission of guilt.  And, if the Administration thought they might score some points, think again.  As the aforementioned Congresswoman is quoted "I am pleased that Secretary Powell is as committed as I am to a fair and democratic process."  This will be the Democratic line on OSCE observers: that either it is all because of their party or that a few quasi-Republicans in the Administration made it happen.   Assuming that the Administration even knew about this - one sometimes wonders how tightly the White House really controls things - it sets a bad precedent, but, more importantly, seems an admission of guilt, an opportunity for those hostile to the Administration and/or America to attack our system and a betrayal of the Founders and the system they conceived.  If we have so little faith in our electoral system that we need Germans and Frenchmen to monitor it, maybe the republican experiment is well and truly dead.

      That's the only way to explain his statements this week about whether or not he would have gone to war with Iraq and about the President taking a whole 7 minutes from the time he heard of the attacks on 9/11 to the time when he stood up and left the Florida classroom he had visiting.   Regarding the former, Kerry (at the Unity Conference last week) said, "[y]ou bet we might have," adding that the result would not have cost as much in American casualties or taxpayers' money. I'm sorry but what the heck is he on?  Might have?  John Kerry once again demonstrates that he is a gutless worm and that he has all the worst traits of the stereotypical politician.  Not only can he still not take a stand on Iraq, but he claims magical powers (how else can he know that, if he had decided to go to war it would have been less costly).  Everyone likes to Monday morning quarterback, but this is ridiculous.  John Kerry is not fit to walk the streets, let alone sit in the White House.  Oh, an it just gets better. Regarding the latter (what he would have done on 9/11) Kerry, still at the Unity Conference, took his lines from Michael Moore when he said "Had I been reading to children and had my top aide whispered into my ear, 'America was under attack,' I would have told those kids very politely and nicely that, the president of the United States had something he needed to attend to."  Hmm...then why did he say on July 8th during a chat with Larry King (the transcript is  urlLink here  and I would not dream of dignifying what King does as an interview) when asked where he was on that horrible day "I was in the Capitol. We'd just had a meeting -- we'd just come into a leadership meeting in Tom Daschle's office, looking out at the Capitol. And as I came in, Barbara Boxer and Harry Reid were standing there, and we watched the second plane come in to the building. And we shortly thereafter sat down at the table and then we just realized nobody could think, and then boom, right behind us, we saw the cloud of explosion at the Pentagon."  So, he sat around from the time he saw the second plane impact (he says he saw this live, so that was 0903) and that he was still sitting around when "boom" (at 9:37).  So he sat around for at least half an hour doing nothing.  Apparently, if he had been President, he would have rushed right out and then not thought of anything for 30 plus minutes.  Oh, and I don't know how he saw anything or heard the impact, given that I was closer to the Pentagon and neither saw nor heard a thing.  Of course, unlike Kerry, I was in the midst of actually doing something other than sitting around waiting for someone to give me instructions, so maybe I was distracted. The real issue here, of course, is what Kerry's statements show us about the man. In the case of his statement about Iraq, it shows someone who is almost pathologically incapable of standing for something.  I had earlier joked about him being a post-modern politician, one who thinks that all points-of-view are equally true and, therefore, holds them all.  Now, I'm not joking.  This guy doesn't even know what the truth is.  All he does is say whatever is necessary at the moment.  This holds true even more with his statements on 9/11.  To even bring up the President's reactions in the first few minutes is pointless.  It is the worst kind of political mudslinging. But to go on and state that you would have leapt into action, when, by your open statements, you admit you sat around with your thumb up your ass until someone told you to run away, is even worse.  Kerry continues to make it clear why he cannot be trusted to hold the office of President.  Policies aside, he just is not a leader, but rather, a power-hungry shell of a man.  Let us hope that enough of the electorate realizes this and keeps him out of office. Note: All of Kerry's quotes from the Unit Conference are from  urlLink this article  at the Boston Globe.

      Well, the numbers for July are out and they are less-than-spectacular.  Only 32k jobs were added and unemployment went down 1/10 of a point.  This number is far less than was expected and is the fourth month of declining new job numbers.  In reaction, at least in part, NASDAQ, the Dow and the S&P all closed down (44.74 points, 147.70 points, and 16.73 points respectively).  How much is due to the job numbers and how much due to high oil prices and continuing terrorism worries is hard to say, although the lackluster employment numbers are obviously a big part.  So, why aren't employers hiring in the numbers that experts think they should be?  Probably because of the aforementioned energy and terror concerns, plus continued fall-out from the collapse of the tech boom of the late-90s.  And, the gloomy pronouncements coming from the Democrats this year can't help.  Undoubtedly, some employers are also holding off to see who wins the election in November.  Given the ongoing attempts of the Kerry campaign to turn Americans against "big business" firms may be holding off hiring until they now whether or not the rhetoric will have a chance to become policy. All that said, we have still had a year of steady job growth and hourly wages were up in July.  The main thing, as I have said all along, is trends.  One month of figures - good or bad - is unimportant.  6 to 12 months of figures matters.  So, we'll have to see over the course of the next few months if this was just a mid-summer trough or the beginning of a period of soft or no job growth.

      Here are a few things that are happening this Saturday morning:    In Zimbabwe, Justice Sandra Mungwra of the High Court has acquitted 6 members of the  urlLink Movement for Democratic Change , who had been on trial for their alledged role in the 2001 murder of an ally of Robert Mugabe's ZANU(PF).  This is an uncommon bright spot in what has been a steady stream of dark news from Zimbabwe.  Even while Mugabe and his cronies continue to run Zimbabwe into the ground, it is people like Justice Mungwra who provide some hope for the future.  For more, go to the  urlLink Washington Post .   The US has entered into and agreement with Denmark and Greenland to upgrade radar equipment at Thule AFB.  This upgrade will allow Thule to be used a part of America's ABM defense network.   Pakistan and China just wrapped up a joint counter-terrorism exercise, dubbed Friendship 2004.  For a more, go to  urlLink Xinhua .  The exercise demonstrate how both countries have an interest in quelling not only rebellious elements in their own countries, but also in stopping the flow of radicals from one country to the other and in cooperating in efforts to halt the movement of radical Muslims from the 'Stans into Pakistan and China.  Finally, it never hurts the standing of both the governments in Islamabad and Beijing to rattle the Indians a bit.   British forces are pulling out of Goose Bay, Canada.  Long used as an RAF training facility (and, at one point during the '70s, home to 7,000 USAF personnel) Goose Bay is another Cold War relic (although founded in WW2 to support trans-Atlantic ops, the base came into its own during the Cold War) that tight budgets and changing missions has rendered obsolete.  Some NATO training (notably German and Italian) will continue and the RAF has said they may still train there, using local contractors rather than RAF personnel for support.   Under the "what the heck are they thinking" category comes this story from the  urlLink CBC .  Druggies and their "advocates want a a "safe inhalation room" for people who smoke crack cocaine.  Vancouver already has a "safe injection site" which "serves" 4,700 injection drug users.  As heroin addict Dean Wilson puts it, "I think we should give the same courtesy to people who smoke rock as we did with the safe injection site."  Crack addict Rob Morgan adds, "[i]t's just really high strung standing in this alley, because you're exposed not only to the cops, but to every form of violence." Umm, isn't it illegal to use drugs in Canada?  Shouldn't these people be arrested when they enter their "safe injection room?"  I am for drug legalization; however, I think that this kind of situation - where the state makes an act illegal and then facilitates the commission of that illegal act - is the worst thing to do.  It undermines the whole concept of law.  If an act is illegal, then the state should not provide an environment where those illegal acts can be performed.  Also, it would seem that this kind of undermining of the law would increase the number of people willing to use drugs and decrease the likelihood of people stopping.  Canada has made a bad decision in opening the safe shooting gallery.  Let's hope they don't compound things by opening up another quasi-legal drug-den.

      In the past two days, there has been heavy fighting in Iraq, as members of the Sadr militia resumed full-scale attacks on Coalition and Iraqi government forces.  The US kill ratio: 100 to 1.  Yep, they've lost an estimated 300 men (probably many more).  We've had three fatalities (the Iraqi government has lost additional personnel).  Well, as long as Sadr and company are going to oblige us and come out into the open, we might as well take advantage of the situation and do what we should have done in April; kill Sadr and wipe out his followers.  And, with this kind of kill rate, it shouldn't take too long to accomplish this. Oh, and is it distasteful to revel in the deaths of our enemies?  Hmm...naw.  They're the enemy not just of the United States, but also the enemy of the mass of Iraqi people who want a chance to rebuild their war ravaged nation, not spend the next decade caught in the cross-fire between the West and the West's adversaries.

      The mayor of Hiroshima has taken the Administration to task for ramping up work on "micro-nukes," low-yield devices that could be used to neutralize high-value targets (like hardened WMD sites).  First, why does being mayor of Hiroshima make one an expert on American defense policy or our strategic posture.  Second, although the  urlLink CBC  does not mention it, I hope the mayor also took the time to condemn the war of aggression that Japan launched that led to the nuking of Hiroshima, the mass atrocities that Japan committed during that WW2 (during the Rape of Nanking, for example, 300,000 Chinese civilians were butchered by Japanese troops, far more than were killed in the two a-bombings), condemned the ongoing trend in Japan to downplay their role in WW2 and emphasize the a-bombings in a context free manner and, finally, suggested other means of destroying the kinds of targets that micro-nukes would be used against that would be equally effective.  But, I kind of doubt that he did any of these.

      The Chicago Tribune is  urlLink reporting  that Alan Keyes is going to accept the GOP's request to run against Democratic flavor-of-the-month Barack Obama for the Senate.  For those who do not know, Mr. Keyes is a former US rep to the UN and has run unsuccessfully for the Senate (from Maryland) and the Presidency.  He is, in my opinion, far right, a devout Christian and one of the best speakers in the political world.  I think that he would make a far better Senator than the far-Left Obama.  That said, however, he was highly critical (and rightly so) of Senator Clinton when she was just carpetbagger Clinton, shopping for a seat she could run for.   The GOP needs to pick someone to run (Jack Ryan was going to run against Obama, before his "personal issues" became known), but Keyes has no ties to Illinois that I know of and the GOP needs to do better than to just pick a name out of a hat.  Is there no one in the Illinois GOP that can run?  If so, that is sad.  Of course, the GOP leadership probably knows that Keyes has zero chance and just want to run a sacrificial lamb who can bring out Obama's Leftist tendencies. Apparently, the Republican state organization was seriously divided between moderate and conservative wings while they looked for a replacement for Ryan.  Well, at this point the Dems will almost certainly pick up this seat in November, no matter who runs.  It's just too bad to see someone who has always seemed to have a high-degree of personal integrity to do something like this (assuming the report is correct).

Chad is trying to secure a loan from the IMF to help pay for the costs of the estimated 100k refugees from the Darfur region (Chad's GDP is about $11b).  Hopefully, the IMF will provide whatever funds are needed.  Meanwhile, France has 1200 troops in Chad who are, among other things, helping secure the border and providing humanitarian assistance.  Good for them.   The whole region is in serious trouble (and has been for some time).  It is unfortunate that it took this particular crisis to move the human rights disaster that is the Sudan to the forefront of global consciousness.

      Senator McCain has condemned the ad by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, saying "it reopens all the old wounds of the Vietnam War, which I spent the last 35 years trying to heal...I deplore this kind of politics...I think the ad is dishonest and dishonorable. As it is, none of these individuals served on the boat (Kerry) commanded. Many of his crew have testified to his courage under fire. I think John Kerry served honorably in Vietnam. I think George Bush served honorably in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War."  The Senator also called on the White House to follow suit and attack the group and the ads.  Admiral Roy Hoffmann, head of the group, said they respected McCain's "right to express his opinion and we hope he extends to us the same respect and courtesy, particularly since we served with John Kerry, we knew him well and Sen. McCain did not."  Okay, first, I stand by my statements that, a) Kerry served his country, under fire, in 'Indian Country,' b) however, by making that service the centerpiece of his campaign neither he nor men like McCain should expect a free-ride particularly when c) Kerry has been critical of Bush's service in the National Guard.  In McCain's defense, he calls both the service of Kerry and the President honorable.  But why should the White House condemn the  opinion  of one group of men?  Does Kerry personally condemn every negative statement made about the President?  No; and in fact he contributes to them.  In this case, the group doing this has the background to make these charges and is not a part of the Bush campaign (although Bush and company are obviously going to be pleased with their activities). McCain is, of course, entitled to his opinion; but he should recognize that Kerry is the one who has made service in Vietnam so important in this election, not Bush.

      By the campaign, that is.  Who or what am I talking about, you might ask?  Washington Post writer David Maraniss, that's who.  In this morning's paper, Maraniss has a front page story,  urlLink Kerry Detours to Visit Town Skipped by Bush , that has little purpose, other than to serve as a booster piece for Kerry.  The story is that Bush, while zipping through Wisconsin in May, drove through the town of Cuba City (population: 2174) without stopping.  Kerry's campaign got wind of this and stopped in the town yesterday to shake hands and kiss babies.   Even though the Bush campaign had not set up a stop there, the townspeople heard the President was coming through and were disappointed that he didn't stop. Maraniss characterizes this as Bush "sucker[ing]" the people of the town.  I wonder, has the Post run stories about how Kerry has "suckered" every population center he has driven through without stopping?   The picture of Kerry presented is that of a man who cares deeply about the "little man," while Bush and company "rumbl[ed] down Main Street at 40 miles an hour" disappointing "A thousand schoolchildren" (so, half the population is made up of schoolchildren?  Hmm...). If the story was a general analysis of how both campaigns are, or are not, engaging in low-level "retail" politics, I'd have no problem with the story.  But, it fits so perfectly with the Kerry campaign's message of "we like little guys, Bush hates you," that I have trouble thinking of this as a valid campaign analysis.  Instead, it is a blatantly pro-Kerry story that the Post should be ashamed of running. In my humble opinion, as always.

      A new book,  Unfit for Command : Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry , calls into question many of John Kerry's assertions of bravery and honorable conduct in Vietnam.  The book has had the input of a number of his former shipmates and commanding officers, who have formed  urlLink Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , and, if  urlLink this new ad  is any indication, there are a lot of combat vets who are angry with Kerry.  The vets charge that he fabricated or exaggerated his acts of heroism and dishonored the memories of all Vietnam vets with his post-war accusations of mass war crimes.   In the coming months, this line of attack could be very effective, since so much of Kerry's campaign is based on the four months he spent in Vietnam.  He rarely misses an opportunity to reference his tour, even when it has little if anything to do with whatever issue is at hand.  If either the Bush campaign or groups like Swift Boat vets (who would be much more effective, since they have a veneer of being non-partisan and are made up of men who actually served in Vietnam) focus on Kerry's service and call into doubt what he did both in Vietnam and afterwards, it could seriously damage one of the props supporting his campaign.

      The Sudanese continue to show us how low people can sink.  Here's how the Beeb describes pro-genocide marches in Khartoum:   Tens of thousands of people have marched through the Sudanese capital Khartoum in protest against any foreign intervention in war-ravaged Darfur.  The government-backed protesters said they were ready to die in a jihad if any foreign troops entered the country.    Well, it's good to see that "tens of thousands" of Muslims would take up arms to stop foreign troops from halting the massacre of hundreds of thousands of...Muslims.  I thought Islam was a religion of peace.  Shouldn't the peace-loving Muslims of Sudan support anything that would save their co-religionists?  Of course, religion here is wrapped in sectarian and tribal struggles and feelings of nationalism, so it is not quite that simple.  However, this should serve as a reminder that many people around the world must be forced to behave.  We cannot sit back and assume that gentler forms of persuasion will work.  Either that, or we stop kidding ourselves about being a force for human rights.    In related, but much better news,    Meanwhile, an  urlLink African Union  (AU) spokesman said the organisation was prepared to strengthen the size of the force it plans to deploy to Darfur.   "The AU plans to increase troop strength of its protection force for Darfur from 300 to 2,000, with Nigeria and Rwanda offering to send 1,000 troops each," Adam Thiam told the Reuters news agency.    More troops will be needed, but the offer is welcome. It is good to see the neighbors looking out for their own.

      Some of you may wonder why I refer to our Nation's fair capital as Kinshasa on the Potomac.  Well, today's  urlLink Washington Post  has a story that demonstrates why.    On Monday, a conductor left her train sitting in a station, door to the conductor compartment wide open, no replacement in sight.  Here's the Post's account;    A Metro train operator abandoned her train in a station during the evening rush hour Monday, hopping aboard a train going in the opposite direction and leaving behind hundreds of bewildered homebound commuters, according to passengers and transit officials.   The six-car Red Line train, headed for Shady Grove, pulled into the Van Ness-UDC Station at 7:16 p.m. and sat idling for 12 minutes with the door to the conductor's compartment yawning open, according to the accounts  Although a substitute operator was found ultimately and the train sent on its way, the incident, which occurred on an evening of heightened security concerns, was something that "should never happen," a Metro spokeswoman said last night.   She said Metro "made a mistake" when the train operator was allowed to leave the train. Procedure does not permit operators to leave trains idling, and the matter is under investigation, spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein said.   Farbstein declined to identify the operator or any of the other Metro employees involved. None has been suspended, she said.   [...]  The operator left the train, crossed the platform and caught Train 202, which was headed in the opposite direction, to Glenmont, Farbstein said.   "The door to the conductor's compartment was wide open, and the conductor was nowhere to be seen," one passenger wrote in an e-mail to The Washington Post. "Minutes passed, and no one had any idea what was going on."   The passenger said the station manager was informed but offered no explanation.   Farbstein said station managers are not authorized to enter the cab or make announcements on the train's public address system.    So, the bonehead in charge of the train wanders off, even though no one had arrived to take over.  She leaves the door to her compartment open.  And the station manager can't enter the train operators compartment?  He can't let the passengers know to sit tight?  Hey, did he even lock the frickin' door?  Why have these people not been fired?  At least the conductor should be bounced, immediately.  Metro employees are "efficient" enough to arrest people for chewing a candybar in the station (go  urlLink here  for that story) but they can't get it through their thick skulls that you don't just saunter away from a loaded train?

      According to Denzel, he's an ex-slave.  In an interview with Katie Couric he had the following to say when asked if he had seen F9/11   "You know, I haven't seen Fahrenheit 9/11, because I live in America. I grew up here. I'm an ex-slave. I'm a result of what this country can do. So it's nothing knew to me. I'm not surprised at all. It's just business as usual.  What I want to talk about is, what are we doing right now, today, for these young kids that are coming home?    So, how old is Denzel?  To have been a slave in this country, he would have to be at least 139 years old.  Well, he looks good for a man of his age.  Given that many people around the globe are still held in bondage (not all formally slaves, of course.  But the position of many Third World workers, women and members of minority groups or 'inferior' castes, etc is similar) for someone like Washington - one of the richest men in Hollywood - to claim kinship with the oppressed masses of humanity is, well, obscene. Oh, and Mr. Washington, I'm not certain how you define "young kids" but that generally does not encompass people in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s.  We need to stop infantilizing the military.  The  men  and  women  who are serving this country need as much support as we can give them.  They do not need some rich man talking down to them, pretending they are helpless children. You can read the rest of the interview with Washington, Meryl Streep and Johnathan Demme (if you really have some time to kill) at  urlLink MSNBC .

      That's the big headline for both the  urlLink Times  and  urlLink Post .  Of course, when you read the articles, what is apparent is  not  that the intel we had was three years old, but that the info pulled off of Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan's laptop (see  urlLink Never Save Your Terror Plans on a Laptop ) was three years old and was quite new to the US intel community.  Coupled with a number of other public incidents (the warning last month of more chatter in the pre-election months, the arrests in Texas and Pakistan of other Al Qaeda members, the long-standing and well-known interest on the part Al Qaeda in striking at the US/Western economy) and, one might assume, other info that has not been made public or been leaked and it seems that the raising of the alert level was warranted.  Of course, people like Howard Dean will probably see something sinister or underhanded on the part of the Administration.  Dean, of course had the following to say on Sunday on Wolf Blitzer's show:   "I am concerned that every time something happens that's not good for President Bush he plays this trump card, which is terrorism. His whole campaign is based on the notion that "I can keep you safe, therefore at times of difficulty for America stick with me," and then out comes Tom Ridge.   It's just impossible to know how much of this is real and how much of this is politics, and I suspect there's some of both in it.   BLITZER: Well, when you say that, that's a very serious allegation, that the federal government, Tom Ridge, the president of the United States, may be playing politics with the whole issue of fear and terror threat levels. And I want you to explain specifically, so there's no confusion, what you mean by that.   DEAN: What I mean by that is the president himself has played politics with it. The president is basing his political campaign for re-election on the notion that he ought to be re-elected because terrorism is a danger, and his case to the American people is, "I'm the only person who can get us through this." So of course this is politics."   Sigh.  Given that this was before today's headlines, imagine what people like Dean will say now.

      This morning the Mercury Messenger lifted off, beginning a trip that in 7 years will end with the 1 ton spaceship in orbit around one of the most hellish environments in the solar system.  This is another example of how America continues to push back the boundaries of human knowledge.  The folks at NASA have earned a pat on the back for this one.

      Just a little bit more on bounces.  CNN is trying to explain why the Kerry campaign either received a slight bounce from DemCon04 or actually lost ground, saying, among other things, that it is because of partial coverage from the majors, that not enough time has passed, that most people are already decided, etc.  All this may be true.  But, if Kerry had snagged, say, 10 points on Bush, would CNN and the other Leftist elements of the media be trying to explain why this really didn't mean anything and that the President was in a much stronger position than the numbers appeared to indicate?  I wouldn't bet on it.  Good news for Bush/Cheney is downplayed.  Good news for Kerry/Edwards is emphasized.

      Kerry is anxious to get the Russians involved in Iraq.  He has made it clear in numerous speeches that he wants them to send help to Iraq.  Maybe he should tell them to stop selling MiGs to the Sudanese.  Yep, while the UN, the US and Europe condemn the genocidal tactics of the Sudanese government, the Russian government continues to sell them weapons, including MiGs that the Sudanese have been using to bomb villages full of civilians.  Why hasn't Kerry addressed this, rather than saying that he wants Russia involved in Iraq and that he wants to ensure that Russia - along with other nations - receives contracts to help rebuild Iraq? Is that the Kerry Doctrine?  To turn a blind eye to genocide, just so long as the perpetrators help Kerry look good?   I raise this point for a reason. Kerry and Edwards have been mindlessly repeating the need to bring France, Germany, Russia, and China into Iraq.  They seem, however, to have skipped the part where they analyze why those nations are not involved in our efforts in that country or why we would want them there.  Once again, Kerry simplifies a complex situation and a complex set of interests and goals to his mantra of "Bush bad, me good, getting these nations on board good, no matter what the cost to us."  Is Kerry capable of complex thought?  If so, why would he want to the Russians in Iraq for any reason?  How is that in our long-term best interest.  And, would the Iraqi government want this (given the ties between the Russians and Hussein)?  I would like to hear him explain his rationale.

      It looks like the source of the intel that led to yesterday's increase in the threat level is Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan, a 25-year-old computer engineer who helped to operate a secret Al Qaeda communications system where information was transferred via coded messages either via email or through codes on Websites(for the full story see the  urlLink New York Times ).  He was picked up in Pakistan on July 13 and, according to the article, had a treasure trove on intel on him.  If he really was a communications coordinator for Al Qaeda, then we might hope to see even more arrests/neutralizations in the near future.  This is good news for our side.  it also shows how sophisticated our enemies our and how they continue to turn the fruits of our genius against us.

       urlLink Gallup  (among others) are reporting that Kerry received no convention related bounce.  Here are the important numbers:   Among likely voters Kerry actually lost ground to Bush.  On July 19-21 he was leading 49 -47.  In the post-convention poll (July 30 - 31) Kerry was behind, 47 - 50.  Among all registered voters both he and Bush picked up from the July 19 -21 poll, Kerry going from 49 to 50, Bush from 45 to 47.   Of course, these numbers all within the poll's margin of error.  And it gets worse for Kerry once you factor in Nader.  Here's what Gallup had to say, both on the history of post-convention bounces and the Nader factor.   An analysis of convention bounces since 1950 shows that on average, among registered voters, the Democratic candidate received approximately a seven-point increase in support following the convention. The current poll shows only a one-point increase among registered voters. In addition, following previous Democratic conventions, the Republican candidate also lost an average of about five points, making the net effect essentially a 12-point swing in the lead. The current poll shows only a 1-point swing in the lead among registered voters, but for the Republican, not the Democrat.  In the current poll, if independent candidate Ralph Nader is included in the vote tally, Bush leads Kerry by four points among likely voters (50% to 46%), with Nader receiving 2%. Among registered voters, it's a dead heat at 47% each for Bush and Kerry, with Nader at 3%. Among both groups the percentage of voters favoring Nader and the number of undecideds is lower now than before the convention, suggesting one impact of the convention -- at least in the short term -- was to focus voters more directly on the two major party candidates.   This is still very close, but it is also very good news for Bush.  Of even more interest (at least to me) is that from March to July the number of "committed" Bush voters has gone up (from 38 to 45), while the number of Committed Kerry voters has gone down (from 45 to 42). So, is this curtains for Kerry?  Of course not; but this does show that the "hate Bush and Republicans" line is not swaying large numbers of undecided voters.  It also shows that the President could be poised to make an historic win.  Now, he needs to articulate his vision for the next four years and pound on the obvious problems with the Kerry platform.  The polls show that the election is the President's to win or lose.

      Homeland Security has increased the threat level in DC, NYC and Northern NJ, saying new data shows specific threats to financial centers.  For more info see  urlLink Fox News .   Concern is focused on truck bomb attacks against the World Bank, IMF, Wall Street and the Prudential Building.  And so, once again, our homeland becomes the frontline for the War on Terror. It looks like the apprehension of Farida Goolam Mohamed Ahmed in Texas (a South African woman on terrorist watch lists and en route New York) and/or the apprehension of Al Qaeda member Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani in Pakistan have paid off.  My own guess:  both of them were captured around the same time and both may have either given up information or had intel on them.  Ghailani would have been able to provide our people with info on an overall plan (he was involved in planning the Kenya/Tanzania embassy bombings in '98) while Ahmed may have been part of a cell being mobilized to carry out attacks.  While the two may not be connected, either with each other or today's alert, the timing seems a bit coincidental. First, a congrats to our security people and to Pakistan for nabbing these two.  Second, I'm glad that Homeland Security saw fit to give us a specific location and target types.  Third, let's hope when we are finished draining these two of every bit of useful intel they have, we spare the expense of a trial and just shoot them like the curs they are.
