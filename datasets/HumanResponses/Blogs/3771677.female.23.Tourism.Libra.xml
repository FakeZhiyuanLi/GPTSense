        The Beer Diary's  First Entry:  July 31st, 2004 - Old Folks Birthday Party      I drank one Corona Extra® after which I proceeded to hit a really nice 10 year old in the neck with a frisbee. After I finished my first beer I was tired from all the activity and I laid down in the soft supple green grass. After a small nap I awoke and said "I'm board". I had Charlie hold up a hoola hoop and I dove through it repeatedly. That's it.

        Blogger Time!    It's been a few days and I have a few beers to report.  This blogger thing is funny.  I was reading Michael Moore's Blog a minute ago.  It looks like he spends about as much time as me blogging.  {I concede I actually know I've spent more time but then I don't have a hugely successful documentary in Theaters right now}  I'm looking for my next project though.  I've got a few ideas.  Doobie Hauser - Kid Doctor in Medicinal Marijuana.  So the point of this Blog is to keep up with myself, my drinking and my friends.  It's funny to see small parts of my life I've written about.  If I do this long enough I imagine I'll start to repeat myself.  Beer Diary |  I've had 3 or 4 since I last counted.  I'm not drinking much as I near my 30th Birthday.  I'm too tired all the time.  But it's oh so good.  Latley I really like Mass Transit.  It's got such a bold yet refreshing taste!  I'm a fan.  Made salsa again.  Had no beer.  This batch turned out really good.  I went to a wedding today.  It was up in the mountains outside the city of Colorado Springs.  It was beautiful - The groom was overflowing with emotion.  The bride beautiful.  This is the second wedding I've been to lately where the groom gets misty.  Are men changing?  I too was filled with excitement and emotion as I watched the ceremony and listened to what the bride and groom had to say.  I'm glad to have been there.

      The road to the Olympics is already extremely difficult. I'm no Olympian but I know this, to train for an event like gymnastics you have to go through grueling practices, avoid any kind of injury, keep your body in perfect shape, that means no twinkies, and also continue on with life's responsibilities. Another thing to take into account is that before the Olympic committee made a ruling that allowed professional athletes to take place in the event, you had to be an amateur in order to partake in the Olympics.  To be an amateur athlete means that you're not a professional, hence you don't make a lot of money. Considering the high cost of making it to the Olympics, it seems against the odds that any amateur relying soley on their income has ever made it.  One of the 2004 USA Olympic Gymnastics team member, Mohini Bhardwaj, has been trying to live out her Olympic dream for many years. Like most gymnasts, Mohini started her journey towards the Olympics at a very young age. She eventually got accepted into UCLA where she continued to practice gymnastics while trying for the Olympic team. She didn't make the team during the trials for 2000 Summer Olympics but vowed to do whatever it took to make the 2004 team. Lucky for her Pam Anderson's heart is as big as her chest. Bhardwaj's friends and family were selling raffle tickets to make enough money to send her to the Olympic trials. One of her friend's mother offered a raffle ticket to her neighbor who just happened to be baywatch beauty, actress, model, animal rights activist, and new novelist Pamela Anderson. Pam being a former gymnast herself, yes that's right guys, Pam was a gymanst, took an immediate interest and decided to go down to the gym to see Bhardwaj is person. She liked her and in that same first visit, wrote her out a check for $25,000 so she could go to the June Olympic trials. Mohini made the Olympic team and as of Tuesday, August 12, is an Olympic silver winner.
