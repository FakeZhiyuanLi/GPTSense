      I could blab about a lot of things on this early morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I will.&nbsp;   Yes, how about starting with my surroundings - Mexico.&nbsp; This past weekend, I&nbsp;embarked on a little&nbsp;trip to a town called Puebla. In Puebla, I met-up with a friend of a friend, his name was Tony.&nbsp; I have been around many interesting characters in my life.&nbsp; Tony was recently added to the list.&nbsp; Simply put: what a talker.&nbsp; This&nbsp;fella has a silver tongue, smarts, and&nbsp;a clever whit.&nbsp; All of these&nbsp;mix and bubble to expell an absolute potent capacity to network.&nbsp; In a mere&nbsp;26 hours of being in the same proximity of this man, I witnessed him razzle and dazzle a professional&nbsp;mexican baseball coach (during a game, ontop of the dugout),&nbsp;shoot-the-bull with countless&nbsp;taxi drivers,&nbsp;&nbsp;and verbally wrestle with&nbsp;several night club managers.&nbsp; Did I mention he did all of&nbsp;this in Spanish?&nbsp; Smooth cat.&nbsp; Oh, the actual town of Pueble was super sweet.&nbsp; Acceptionally different from that which goes on here in the D.F. (Mexico City).&nbsp;   Yesterday, I went on a little field study/hunt.&nbsp; "Study/hunt" because&nbsp;that is what it was.&nbsp; Ocho (8) peeps hopped in a van that seats 7 and drove into a surprisingly lush, rural town, south of the D.F.&nbsp; The study - a parasite called Taenia Solium.&nbsp; The hunt - infected piggies.&nbsp; What a freaking blast.&nbsp; (I would use one of these " ! " but I think they are gay).&nbsp; Have you ever attempted to rope and wrastle with a pig?&nbsp; Well, try to imagine painting your favorite album cover while flying mid-air on the left wing of a small aircraft, because its way different than that.&nbsp; Almost as fun as taking a&nbsp;sit-down bath.&nbsp;  There is something that I was reminded of this past week when I went to a musem.&nbsp; I try, and sometimes I even fool myself into believing that I understand the concept of art.&nbsp; Painting art, not art in the context of music or theatre - those appear to serve a purpose.&nbsp; Paintings on the other hand, especially abstract ones, just perplex me.&nbsp; I mean, yeah, I get curious and stare at them and think " just what the hell was this moron thinking?"&nbsp; Two minutes or less later, I realize in fact, that I have become the moron and that I am wasting valuable brain nutrients that could be utlized in formulating thoughts to rationalize why I walked into a Contemporary Art Exhibt.&nbsp; And for those who have not been into one in the past decade or so, contemporary art has become synonomus with porn.&nbsp; All of the specimens&nbsp;say: "Look, I have an angry face and a piercing in a place that every other super hooker has....but look who paid $10 to verify that he is and idiot for questioning his prudence."&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I think as I walk out...I could have gotten a churro.  &nbsp; You know what rarely makes sense to me?&nbsp; Sleep.  Except for now.&nbsp; Be good.

      Hola, that means "Hello," sometimes even "Hi."&nbsp; I bet you think you would be real creative to answer your next phone call with this Spanish greeting.&nbsp; However, if it happened to be a Mexican native on the other end of the line, your attempt would be met with stout puzzlement.&nbsp; Reason being, Mexicans use the word "bueno" to answer their telephone calls, not "Hola" - you moron.  &nbsp;  By the way, I am living in Mexico City or Distrito Federal this summer.&nbsp; This is how I know the above information, you idiota.&nbsp; Translate that yourself.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In regards to living in Mexico, I wanted to dispell a few common misconceptions about living in Mexico City.&nbsp; I actually returned to Texas for a week at the start of July.&nbsp; Upon my arrival, more than one person mentioned that I did not look any darker.&nbsp; This is the first misconception and here is my response: 1) Mexico City is in the mountains&nbsp;&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; The summer is the rainy season here&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; &nbsp;All of the tanning places here are booked until November&nbsp;4)&nbsp; There is no&nbsp;transfer across human GI epithelial&nbsp;tissue&nbsp;and incorporation&nbsp;of the skin pigment, melanin, into the skin of&nbsp;persons who eat Mexicans....this concept however does occur in the avian species frequently referred to as the Pink Flamingo after it consumes special aquatic life, otherwise this&nbsp;bird would be white.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, there is also another related situation&nbsp;with one of the big cats - the panther or&nbsp;puma or mountain lion&nbsp;- they eat criminals and solve mysteries, which is how they landed their own cartoon series and two movie deals, both of which were freaking hilarious by the way.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Another frequent misconception that I have encountered with USAians in regard to Mexico City is that this town does not have electricity or paved roads and is a grand collection of adobe huts.&nbsp; My response:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; Mexico City is currently home to over 24 MILLION people, which ranks it #1 in population for cities on the planet Earth.......urbanization as it is known in USA, was accomplished some years ago.&nbsp; Out of those 24 million I previously mentioned, there were like 9 smart ones who figured out how to call the Bush (Sr) administriation in the early 90's and get in on that North American Free Trade Alliance thing.&nbsp; *No disrespect to the other 23, 999, 991 Mexicans that did not contribute to that phone call, I didn't mean to imply that you all are not smart, you neaderthals *&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; Turns out, here in Mexico there is somewhat of a labor force avaliable, so yeah, they have paved roads.&nbsp; They suck, but they are hard.&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; Adobe is not really the material of choice here in Mexico City for housing, its more like string and tarp, adobe has cement-like compounds in it that makes it durabaster and more sturdy.&nbsp; &nbsp;  That will have to do for the misconceptions of Mexico City for now, I am tired of rambling on about them.&nbsp; Come visit.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can take the public transportation here, its better than your favorite ride at your favorite theme park.&nbsp; You hozer.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Props to:&nbsp;  Lacey, Adam  - he actually invented the concept of a props list to which I have not yet credited him for, cheers.&nbsp;  Danby, Michael  - for being the author of "Woman in Black."&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Confession:&nbsp; I actually did not&nbsp;come up with the super clever name "Brett on&nbsp;the Net."&nbsp; That whim of ingenuity came from mi amigo,  Guillermo Prieto .&nbsp; Who also knows me as&nbsp;"Beto Oeste" which is my Spanish alias...I did come up with that though.&nbsp; Translate&nbsp;that and you will be&nbsp;reassurred that my&nbsp;creative naming prowess is still first rate.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ok, here in Mexico City the time is now 2:25 am, that would make it 2:25 am Texas time.&nbsp; So you can understand the reason I am feeling a bit more ready for the bed and beauties than you are.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Be swell  &nbsp;

      Yes, I was so intensely upset with a number of humans that I decided to create my own blog. Simply to complain. It would take entirely too much out of me to detail the day, so here is the jiffy:  &nbsp; I have 4 freinds this summer, 3/4 go to bed at 8:30pm.  &nbsp; Tres (3) let downs today, all involving females. How do you say "Does this suprise anyone" in Spanish?  &nbsp; Do you know how to respond to modern media (email, IM, telephone)? Wow, hi. We should be friends.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Props to:  Danby, Michael  - for being the genius he is.  Prieto, Guillermo  - for taking me on a fantastico tour of downtown MC and to the sweetest eatery/cantina.  Swoops, Bill  - why not?  Lacey, Adam  - for his applauding of Jamie Story on her recent accomplishment.  Rogers, Nathaniel  - cause I know he will actually read this and because he is cuddly.  &nbsp; &nbsp; Cuddly is a nice way to end this.
