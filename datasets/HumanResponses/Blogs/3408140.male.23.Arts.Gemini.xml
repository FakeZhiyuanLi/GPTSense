       Hi  It's that time of year again where we congregate and celebrate in order to make me look incredibly popular. I will be 23 soon, once again making some of the more mature among you ill with utter contempt for me and my frankly impossible (and ever decreasing) optimism and vivacity (you know me - cynicism and lethargy just aren't in my vocabulary. At all. In fact, what are they doing in that sentence?)  On  Saturday 5th June  I will be found outside Via Fossa, West India Quay from about 3pm. It would be lovely to see you there as I haven't seen some of you for quite a while and I had such a great time last year! You can leave a reply to let me know if you want, or just turn up, or don't reply and don't turn up I won't mind - it's a long way for some of you to travel, particularly Chris Fry, one of Barnet's roundest actors. But if you can come it would be nice.  Matthew

       For a week in June, shortly after my birthday to which you are all invited, I will be taking part in a workshop designed to introduce opera to young children (and to me at the same time, hopefully) it's in Essex somewhere - a nice break from temp(yaaawn)ing.

       Group of us doing showcase for new writers - several scenes of the first 20 Mins of a play at the Arcola theatre on 11 July.   without any exacerbation of the truth I can tell you that it will be the best piece of theatre you have ever seen in your lives, ever. You will be overwhelmed by the amount of sheer natural talent in the room, from writers, directors and actors. I bet even the ushers will be amazing. If we have any, that is. Otherwise we'll do it ourselves and still be f**king great. I'm not lying.   so that's the PR done for now. see you there.   urlLink

       Thanks to everyone who turned up to my birthday, it was a ding-dong-do of an evening! Fun was had, nice food and I even managed to steal a bottle of ketchup (for reasons unknown - well, I suppose you can never have too much tommy sauce?) Nice pressies, will not only will I have fun learning the tin whistle, but also fun driving everyone mad with tinny whining noise.

       Haircut wasn't quite as planned, was a bit disappointed, but it's not terrible. I do look a bit like a girl though, as pointed out by a kind work colleague..

       On Saturday, after seven months of sloth, I shall have my hair cut. The curls curbed. The mop cropped. If all goes to plan I will be the beau of the ball for my party on saurday. If it goes wrong there is no time for damage control and I'll go to my party looking like a dog.   woof.

       Things seem to be beginning to&nbsp;self destruct around me today: lots of work piled on, people trying to take advantage of me being quite easygoing when it comes to my job (and succeeding)&nbsp; and my relationship takes a slight beating. Oh dear.

       Overslept this morning due to complete laziness. Nobody in work was really bothered, except a manager who found it amusing to play the voicemail I left him to the entire office, which was embarrassing. Aprt from that, I could have overslept the entire day without any consequences. It's sort of&nbsp;nice not to be appreciated like this.

       Just had a meeting with the area manager. Turns out he trained as an actor. Now he has given up on pretending to be someone else for a living and has&nbsp;a wife,&nbsp;two kids and a steady, well paid job. Is there a lesson to be learned here? Of course, I was in bed with a model in Barcelona on Friday, so maybe I'll take my lesson from that....

       For some reason, all afternoon I have been quietly humming the theme tune to 'Gentle Ben'.  Perhaps my wild side attempting to break free? Or too much telly.

       Just&nbsp; got back from Barcelona filming commercial for drinks company. Possibly the most bizarre and brilliant experience of the year. Spanish women are amazing (speaking generally of course, but I think I fell for about 6 of them in 3 days). Work wise I humiliated myself in front of 100s of people for money. I have no shame.  About time too, haven't had a proper job since I graduated.&nbsp;After&nbsp;2 1/2 years I was wondering what the hell I was doing wrong - apparently not making a big enough fool of myself was the problem.

       Yesterdays' showcase went very well - was very worried about my second piece as we had only rehearsed it twice and I messed it up earlier. But both were fine, the theatre was full and I really enjoyed the show. It was relaxed and the audience were very polite. Thanks to anyone reading this who turned up! The writers I met were really great, don't think they usually use so many professional actors to show their work so it was nice for us all to have a chat. They invited me to a read through of more of their work. Unpaid, but a good way of keeping busy. Seems like a long time ago already as I'm filing and ansewring phones as I type!  urlLink http://www.wastingmylifetemping.co.uk/anditsslowlykillingme.html

       Continuing in the poetry vein I am trying to remember a poem I made a few years ago using only seven words. The words can be jubled up a bit and shortened but that's it. I will post it up soon, or a version of it which I can only barely remeber!! In the meantime here is an anonymous poem I know. In fact it is the only one I know, poetry is not my forte, although I do think it's cool.     Ode To Daffodils       Fair Daffodils, We weep to see you haste away so soon, As yet the early rising sun Has not attained his noon  Stay, stay until the hasting day Has run but to the evensong, And, having prayed together, We will go with you along  We have short time to stay As you, we have as short a spring, As quick a growth to meet decay As you, or anything  We die as your hours do And fade away, like to the summers rain Or as the tears of mornings' dew Ne'er to be seen again

       Was thinking about poetry earlier and how good it is for people to write stuff like that. Remembered my very first poem:     One day I went to the park

       Have just spent most of today creating a 'legitimate' blog, a very sensible, clean cut, tidy looking blogpage. What a pollava. But it works. A friend of mine advertised his new website the other day and I suddenly felt like a bit of a simpleton. So now let battle commence... a ratings war. If this one's anything to go by then I will lose. Nobody seems interested! Ah well.

       Spent the weekend walking through two Royal Parks, Hyde and Greenwich. Never been to Greenwich park before, its great. Reminded me a little of home with the hills and great view from the observatory. Someone flicked a cigarette butt onto my arm up there but even that didn't really bother me. Too much. Saw the deer (very similar to cows really, except they're faster - cute but dull). Also saw  Lost In Translation  for the first time - what a beautiful film. I love it when nothing really happens except stuff that happens every day, that's why I like  About Schmidt  too. There's something really interesting about nothing in particular; I think only really interesting actors can do it successfully. Are you following? Anyway I like the film and my previous post has been nullified!!
