      bastos mo talaga karin!!! o ayan inunahan ko na kayo! itatago ko na lang sa pangalang jeck, paul, kenneth at jeff ang mga tinuran kong itlog. [straight tagalog to pramis].    : Sino ang pinaka-bugok sa kanila? – silang lahat! Lalo na pag magkakasama sila!!! 	[para mas masaya I-hahalintulad ko ang grado ng kanilang pagka-gagu :D pagkakasunod-sunod ng pangalan] 	JECK:  si jeck ang pinaka-una kong nakilalang gago sa kanila.  Sa totoo lang, mapang-asar lang naman talaga siya noon pa tungkol sa balingkinitan kong katawan.  Mahilig din yan mang-bara.  Naalala ko nung isang gabi pagkatapos maghapunan sa thesis house nila, halos paiyakin nila ko sa debate tungkol sa sari-saring bagay. :D  Pero si jeck ang pinakamaalalahanin sa knila.  Parati siya nagse-send ng kataga at kasabihan sa SMS tungkol sa pagkakaibigan – minsan bakya! He he he  	JEFF:	si jeff ang pinaka-mature sa kanilang lahat, sa madaling salita- pinakamatanda! Oooppsss :D  si jeff ang “first kiss ko” ha ha ha ha [jok onli!!!]  hinde no!!!!  ibig sabihin ko, sa kanilang apat siya lang nakikipag-beso-beso sa kin!  Malisyoso kc ung tatlo e! [kawawa na ko pagtapos nito]… okey lang masaya naman di ba?  Pero si jeff talaga pinaka-malambing sa kanila, naalala ko kelan lang nung…. wala pala ko naalala   mapanloko din to!  Di ko malilimutan nung isang beses sa tambayan ng TFA, kararating palang niya galing sa trabaho yata bigla ba naman ako tinawag, “Karin, mag-BJ tayo sa baba!”  andami nakadinig pati mga AF…. “buko juice” pala! 	KEN:	Ken, di ko talaga sinasadya nung dinner pagkatapos ng delibs ni Dang na sabihan ka “Ken, ung boyfriend ni Barbie”… o tama na!  Tahimik lang yan, pero matinik! Parang mga-tilapia niya sa bulacan!!! Simple lang humirit, di halata pero tagos sa buto, mabibilaukan ka talaga kagaya nung papunta kami sa GB3, muntik na matusok lalamunan ko nung straw :D  Instant friend ko yan, parang lucky me!  Lasingera kasi ako dati, e siya ung pinakamanginginom sa kanilang apat.  May drinking ritual yan every night :D  he he he  	PAUL:	  si pol!!!! Officemate ko yan!!! Wala ko masabi natatakot ako sa’yo eh!!! Ha ha ha… alam naman ng lahat kung gaano ninyo ko inaasar ni jeck nun sa UP… pero hanggang opisina, mas lumala ka pa.  Kasalanan ko daw kung bakit magulo sa opisina pag andun ako, e siya naman tong nagpapasimula :D tsaka kahit naman wala ako, ako pa rin topic pang-aasar mo!  walang pinipiling lugar yan, kahit na maghabulan kami sa mall makapang-asar lang!  Pero sa totoo lang, seryoso yan si pol, lalo na sa trabaho!  Mas madalas niya pa ko mapagalitan kesa sa boss naming… he he he pero natutuwa naman ako sa pagsita niya sa mga mali ko.  Oks lang yon boss!!!  O ayan! Matatapos na pahinga ko!!! Kelangan ko na rin to tapusin….  Konklusyon:  silang apat ay pawang mga BUGOK, pero may masarap naman na bugok na itlog e, sa Bay, Laguna espesyalti nila ung bibingkang bugok na itlog :D  mabantot nga lang he he he

You ought to know by now Love is the look in my eye Lovin' the way you smile when I say "I wish you would stay" You bring out all the youth in me I laugh and cry out all the truth in me Out o' love You should know by now Haven't you felt by now Just what it's like to be loved; Knowin' that certain touch when you're sure Time won't give you more You bring out all the best in me; I wanna hold you till you feel the need Somehow; You should know by now.  If I could just find the words; I wouldn't be left so lonely; I'm your one, my only Then I'd show you how.  Every move as smooth as silk, Say you will; say you will.  Hasn't it crossed your mind Haven't you known all the time Honestly tell me now Has it shown? How much love is grown; The way I tremble at the sight of you I want to learn to love you through and through This I'll beg You should know by now, Hmmm-mmmm  By now You should know by now, oh Don't you think you should know by now?

      alam ko na na alam na niya at alam na niya na alam ko na na alam niya.  labo ba? basta alam niyo na yun!  for those who understand it, thanks for your silence all these years... i'v tried hiding it all these years, i didn't know that i'm hiding nothing.  labo ulit?  it's kinda funny to know this.  but i don't regret nor despise anything that had happened to me lately.  i feel liberated!  sobra! also, i learned a lot of things; about myself, my friendships and how to deal.  i thought this is really corny at 24! but now, i believe, you just have to kick off the truest emotion inside you then forget all about it.  you'll never know bigger things are set to come in your way.  i did just that and i think it's working.  thanks to you! :D

      Alvin Toffler in his book The Third Wave said that one feature of the second wave of human and technology development is the concept of synchronization.  People and technology moving in synch, time and space moving together, side by side.  I had the oppurtunity to watch the Manila Philharmonic Orchestra at the Shangri-La last Saturday, June 27, 2004.  A fine example of synchronicity.  The venue was at the fountain area of the Shang.  Other performers included the Acaffelas, Bayang Barios and Noel Cabangon.    The MPO started their set with the Theme From Mission Impossible, with the flutist starting off the whole performance.  Very impressive, fast and grand sounds.  I was very impressed with the drummer.  I haven't seen such drumming before, the drum set was well utilized.  The orchestra played on with staples such as The Flight of the Bumblebee, songs from the Sound of Music, The Pink Panther, Broadway, James Bond and OPM songs.  No Theme From Star Wars though.  That would have been a visual and musical treat.    I was keenly interested in the playing of the percussionists, which included the big drums, xylophone, congas and even the small triangle and tamburine.  Everything was at its own place and time.  I can distinctly see and hear where and when every percussion instrument was used.    The string instruments was also interesting to look and hear.  They jived and moved around along with the music.  Their rendition of the Flight of the Bumblebee was spectacular, especially when they did finger plucking on their instruments.   I had a hard time distinguishing which instruments were used at the horn section though.  There were clarinets, trumpets, and other instruments I don't know about.  I watched the whole event at the fourth floor of the atrium, so I was watching from above.  The wonders of human achievement.  Very inspiring and moving.  Wish I can be a part of it all.

      Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's hard-earned pay.  You and me, sunday driving, not arriving, on our way, back home.  We're on our way home, we're going home.  Two of us, sending postcards, writing letters on my wall.  You and me burning matches. lifting latches, on our way back home.  We're on our way home, we're going home.  You and I, have memories, longer than the road that stretches out ahead.    Two of us, wearing raincoats, standing so long in the sun.  You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere, on our way back home.  We're goin' home...   I'm goin' home...

      Who is the greatest master plumber?    For me, he can jump, twist, twirl and fly.  He opened many oppurtunities for me.  He thought me the craft, the speed and the attitude.  He is Super Mario.  The greatest master plumber.  Able to jump tall buildings with a single bound.  (insert theme song here.)

      The firm will be dissolved in a week's time.  It has been two years since the founding of the firm.  Now people will have to go their own separate ways.    I am talking about the Apartment at Matatag St., otherwise known as the Firm.  Or the UAP Matatag Chapter.  No I won't write about anything cozy about the place, or the people in it.  I wanna write about change.  Change of lifestyle, change of work, change of atmosphere.  In short, people are moving on.  We are beyond undergraduate school.  We are beyond cutesy lifestyles.  We are now grown up, we need to start our lives.  In my stay in the university, I have been to many places, met many people, tried different things.  I met an accident once.  I had numerous quarrels.  I pestered five ladies.  I went to the depths (the lagoon pipeline) and to the heights (the top of the Gonzales Hall).  I saw the clash of brotherhoods (frat violence), and helped oust a corrupt president.  And I have been inside the hallowed halls of the University for almost ten years already.  But now we are all going our separate ways.  For the better I guess.  Because our lives do not end with Architecture.  We need to reach out, to try new things, meet new people.  I guess we'll just have to accept that fact.  Hail to the Architects, may we all Build.   The devil asked the two wanderers "Are you angels?" "Nay, we are but MEN."    -- The Tribute, Tenacious D

      An Architect's take on the famous Beatles song   Woke up, fell out of bed, Drag a comb across my head, ...Looking up, I noticed I was late, Found my coat and grabbed my hat, Made the bus in seconds flat, Found my way upstairs and had a cup, And when I woke I know I'm in a dream...   Another work week.  Another five days of design, drafting and specifying.  Not to mention the beaurocracy and the mind bending ordeals of talking to clients  (we call them end users)  and contractors (I call them makukulit).  Let's start at the beginning.  (pull out location map)  I live at an apartment near the university where I work, along with five other Architects.  We all have our own jobs, ambitions, angst and goals in life.  But that's for another entry.  Lets talk about the day in the life of the Architect.  That would be me.    (see interior elevations and floor plan)   The Apartment is a typical two storey unit, with two bedrooms upstairs and a common area below.  What makes it special is that it is a place where we share common interests in Architecture, Design and Construction.  You can find several books, software, floorplans, magazines, tools, porn (oops), and gadgets related to the practice.  Plus you get to see our non-arki lives with the various musical, sports, arts and recreational thingies lying around.  The latest craze for me would be the Super Mario Bros. 3 found in the computer, playable thanks to the recently borrowed joystick, and John Grisham's novel  A Time to Kill .   I read the news today oh boy, About a lucky man who made the grade, And though the news was rather sad, Well I just have to laugh...    (pull out work schedule)  The campus office is no different from other Architectural firms.  There are computers, drafting areas, large tables, a plotter, several brochures and materials samples.  At the front is located the boss's office and the Admin office (the headquarters).  One large room is designated for the technical staff, while another smaller room is where the plotter and our place is.   (see details)  My workstation consists of three tables in a u-shape configuration.  I have an a-3 printer beside me.  The plotter is connected to my pc, so whenever somebody plots their plans, I take a coffee break, because the pc goes into slow mode.  I used to have two ladies sitting at opposite workstations beside me.  I used to call them Nap's Angels, though you won't hear me saying that to them.  I have boxes, materials samples and brochures.  Plus I have tons of work to do.   (see work schedule again)  A look into my work schedule: Mornings: 1.  Blog, surf and check e-mail. 2.  Check work schedule, appointments and update work journal for end of the month activity report. 3.  Drafting and design for small projects, quickie submissions and small details. 4.  Eat taho at 10:00am (protein is good for you) 5.  Work again, call end users, work again. 6.  Submit correspondence, have it checked first with bossings, and let yourself be immersed in the beaurocracy. 7.  Cool off. 8.  Eat lunch (econo-meals ala dorm food, lunch outs every Friday)  Afternoon: 1.  Site visits: first would be the admin building, scary project because we talk to vice presidents and vice chancellors; next would be the chemistry laboratories project, scary too because things might explode inside. 2.  Walk-walk-walk.  The university is big, but not that big.  Wish I had one of those scooters--the muscle powered kind, skateboard with handle bars.  That would be cool.  Architect on wheels. 3.  Go back to the office.  Draft again, design, specify, schedule, talk to boss, process pictures, talk to engineers. 4.  Eat merienda (dorm food again) 5.  Refer to number 3 again.  Ah, Architecture.  So many things to do, so little time.  But at least I get to do many things.  Hopefully I'm not that late in life       (see gantt chart and s-curve),  or else I'll have to pay for liquidated damages.  Evening: 1.  Graduate school. 2.  Go home, eat, listen to music, Super Mario again. 3.  Review for the plumbing exam, read John Grisham, surf, sleep.  I'm not a religious person, but I do hope the Great Architect has some plans for me.  He sure would try to throw some thunder bolts along my way.  It's okay, but please Sir, don't specify too many bolts for delivery.   I'd love to turn you on....

      I have many odd mannerisms.  Here are some of them. 1.  When I sometimes watch tv or talk to people, I only shift my two eyes and not my head, thus the resultant looking through the corner of your eyes.  Some people are bothered by this, thinking that I don't pay attention to them, well in fact I do see them.  Don't fret people, there are four of us in my family that has this mannerism.  Weird huh? 2.  I sometimes read in bed with my two feet propped up vertically against the wall.  I feel comfortable reading this way. 3.  I stare into space.  I guess its just me going into sleep mode.  Be afraid if I go into safe mode or hang up.  It's like I'm in the middle of a conversation when a random though distracts me.  Happens all the time. Must get thoughts out.  That't the obvious parts of me.  Wait till you see my thoughts.  It's quite nasty in there.

      I told people I am not that enthusiastic in starting a blog.  Why start now?  here are some reasons:  1.  I am currently at the crossroads.  New friends, new house, new job, back to school. 2.  I need to brush up on my writing skills due to school. 3.  Maybe I do need to open up.    Well let's see where all this leads.  See you around.

      Sometimes I catch myself going in circles when talking to people, at work and at school.  People usually respond after I explain by saying, "So in short..." or "Bottomline is...".  Must be the sigurista in me.  We all know that Contract documents and correspondence should be all complete, but not conversations.  If I can compress three sentences into one, so much the better.  Got tired of this phd student going around in circles during a discussion about our proposal for the survey.  He's a professor of architecture at another school.  He speaks reaaal slooooowwww... so I rescued my groupmate by sharing my cents worth of Architecture and the need for surveying.  I began by introducing "...two keywords that should be remembered, reconciliation and maximization." Data, as in user needs should first be reconciled, then the resources, or the space can later be maximized.  This goes the same for Architecture, planning or any other fields that dwell on the pooling of resources and the identification of user needs.    So maybe I'll just introduce a topic by using keywords first.  That way I can stay away from going in circles.  I wonder if "reconciliation and maximization" has already been put in books...hmmmm....

      Here's an update from our high school batch: 1.  Many are married. 2.  Many are outside of the country. 3.  Some are into the medical fields, some in information technology, some sell encyclopedias, some do multi-level marketing, and some married early.  Looking back, how do I compare myself to them?  I don't have to.  I'm happy with what I have and what I do.

      I get amazed when people are surprised that I work for the government.  Maybe it's because of people's impressions that we government employees are not that overworked, or we just spend time surfing or doing other things aside from work.  One person even made me promise not to waste the taxpayers money.  Ok, noted.  But are we really under or overworked here in our share of the beaurocracy?  The answer, we're doing just fine.  Our office has around 30 projects per team, so that makes it 90 projects all at the same time.  The key here is that we queue the projects in order for us to manage finishing each and every site investigation, project scoping, design, drafting, estimating and supervision.  It's not enough to just finish a requirement, but to finish it with all points noted and consulted with other people.  That's what makes the process slower, but makes it surer.  So don't worry dear taxpayers.  ********  I had a massive headache last night, and up till now I still feel it.  It feels like my one hundred and thirty degrees visual cone has been reduced to ten degrees, because I can't focus.  Working for 8 hours straight for work and 4 hours for academics really drained my powers.  I was supposed to go straight to a watering hole with some of the former Firm but I decided to do a win-win situation assessment.  It turned out that I cannot make it to the said gathering so I opted to just sleep sufficiently, if not soundly. Prioritization muna, next time na ang saya.  The question now is do I continue with this 12hour for two days endeavor for the next 3-4 years, or just enjoy what I already have?  I guess the answer is not yet that obvious.  ***********  So I have only two nights free for the whole week, since I have to sleep early even for Saturday because that day is my physical improvement cum recreation day.  The rest is spent on reading and research.  The problem is I have many things unaccounted for in my schedule: night outs, dates, window shopping sprees.  I just laugh to myself whenever an acquaintance always begin his question with "kailan".  As in, "Kailan tayo blah-blah-blah...".   You go ahead, I'll follow later.  But he never does.  ***********  So am I overworked?

      "Make no little plans, they do not have magic to stir mens blood."  Daniel Burnham sure knows his stuff.  I delivered a voluntary report last night for the PLAN 201 class on the works of Daniel Burnham and the City Beautiful Movement.  I spent a week researching on the net and inside the library for the guy.  By Saturday, I managed to finish the research and do the outline and bulk of the report by Sunday.  I finished the visuals by Sunday night, a few hours before meme time.  Due to the low techness of the SURP, I managed to make do with acetates, but upon projecting the slides, the pictures are too dull and the font small (mental note: buy laptop).  I planned to go around the Manila Area to photo-doc the entire Burnham planned city, but I didn't have the resources and the time to go (note: car).  Another problem was that my printer makes a lot of noise so I have to be quick and discreet going about my printing, so minimal errors are all that is acceptable (note: laser printer).  By the time I started the report, I apologetically made a joke that I haven't made a report in class for over three years, but I meant it as an ice breaker.  So I went through the report, in time-line form.  I started speaking extemporaneously, but after a while I realized that I have an outline and notes.  But it was hard to go back to reading, so I just went ahead, skipping and going back to some points I need to emphasize.  My hand writing and my sketches sucked. But at least I got the message through.   I guess I'm not yet cut out to be a teacher or instructor, but I did manage to impart knowledge and show the non-Architects a thing or two about Architecture and its role in Planning.  Maybe by the time I go into thesis (pray) I will be able to have a more Ekistically structured report.  Until then, I'll just have to live by Daniel Burnham's words, and although it's farfetched that I get to purchase each and every item I mentioned above, at least I get to plan big.

      Tennis is not what I hoped it to be.  It's physically challenging, you have to run and hit the ball at the same time.  It's not enough to just hit the ball, but you have to hit it real hard and you must achieve the correct form at the same time.  It cannot be related to badminton, mainly due to the physical effort you have to exert in order to deliver the ball to the other side.  That's why people tend to grow muscles at one arm and leave the other behind.  Well at least I get to exercise with all the running, mainly due to catching the ball and picking up all the scattered balls all around after a round.  I get to enjoy playing even if its not that good, and get to sweat at the same time.  The coach is all accomodating, even if we can't deliver the balls right.  She provides us good insight into how to do proper deliveries and form, as well as explains the physics behind the game.  I really like to run after the ball end to end, especially when she throws the ball really high.  Reminds me of physics.

      Manny, Jeck and I went to the video launching of the new Radioactive Sago single  Astro  at the 70s Bistro last night.  Due to some alcohol intake I failed to wake up early for work.  But it was worth it.  The video was directed by my former art studies blockmate R.A. Rivera (yes...strangebrew).  R.A. now sports a mohawk and wears those nerdy looking glasses.  We also met up with Ramon Bautista, R.A.'s partner in crime, who, after 10 years still has a crush on one of our arki batchmates.  We talked about old times, old friends, and the still unrealized dream of making the film  Elevator Man and His Sidekick, Bellboy.     Talk about nostalgia.  Well, that was not the end of it.  After stepping out of the Bistro, I was surprised to be greeted by an old Narra Dorm acquaintance.  He was the lead singer of a u.p. band that made it big.  It was funny because they asked me a few years back to sign up as their bassist.  But I declined.  I want to be an architect.  Now they're famous.  Ah, what could have been...

      The fab four has influenced me in a number of ways: 1.  I learned to play musical instruments because of listening too much to their music.  The Beatles is one group who really knows how to deliver a very good sonic experience, in terms of musicality and song writing; 2.  The philosophy of their songs gets to me to the point of relating my experiences to their lyrics. 3.  They give me soul food.   Mabuhay ang Beatles.

      I have come full circle.  Well that is as far as living within Quezon City and studying is concerned.  After living outside of the University for 4 years, I am finally back, after finding a place near my place of work. It's advantageous in terms of proximity to work and school, as well as having a place I can finally call my own (well, that is I still pay rent and share it with one other person).    And another thing is, I think I'm getting over my jadedness inside the University.  I remember one movie wherein the actor comments "you know what your problem is? (in terms of living within New York CIty)  You're all jaded!  What you need is to reach out..." (somebody help me please, I forgot the actor and the movie.  Oh well).  Living inside the University for over ten years has erased the sense of place for me.  At one time I no longer felt proud of living inside the campus, of having the excitement of discovering new places and new things.  The Ikot route and the hills have no meaning for me.  Especially during the latter part of my stay in the College, wherein I practically live inside the building.  The buildings are all the same, the people are the same, and the food is the same.  But having the honor and priveledge of being appointed as Architect inside the University, I am having a second look as to what the University can offer me, both visually and physically.  I now see the buildings more in terms of its history, it's value to the end users, and the sense of community within the various units.  As my engineer-companion in terms of ocular inspections and girl watching (haha!) is concerned, it is not the pay that keeps the people at the oca going.  It's the sense of community.  And I am now part of that community.  Now, travelling along the various routes of the campus, I am now seeing it in a new way, and eventually I also feel a little bit of nostalgia.  I am reminded of events and incidents during my stay as an undergraduate, especially when I go back to the places I have visited a decade ago.  I feel as though I am a freshman again, having the same difficulties of travelling and finding a place to eat.    Now let's just see how far the story will go.

      It  seems that the shitft from construction to design has left me struggling to find technical answers to seemingly simple questions.  Just like any other skill once you stop practicing your brain sorts of slows down.  ___________  Been working on a small resthouse recently, and I'm now at the technical phase of the project.  I can't seem to visualize the proper components for the house, as to what material to use.  I think I'm beginning to realize that I have mastered concrete construction over timber and steel construction, so I can't maximize the potential of the latter two materials when dealing with structural conceptualization for the design.  Concrete structures are generally easier to construct, based on experience, as well as comprehension.  Just read the Structural Code and you'll see what I mean.  Maybe it's due to the fact that it's much easier to visualize concrete and steel reinforcements working together, as compared to steel, wherein you have a wide range of items to choose from, from pipes to tubes, channels to purlins, plates to flanges.  Well I don't want to fall into the trap of blaming the educational system, but it seems that concrete has always been emphasized over steel and timber construction.  I should read up on structural books, so that I can get inspiration for explorations on the use of other materials other than concrete.  Guess I'll start with the Dytoc books.  ________________  It's not enough that Architects rely on the Structural engineer.  Guess that's what another architect imparted on my formative years (which I guess I still am in).  His paranoia for structural design failures succeeded in limiting my imagination when it comes to determining spans and dimensions of structural components.  The worst example of this paranoia came when I was assigned to partly supervise the lifting of steel columns for the footbridge project at the MRT station.  The activity for the day involved the lifting of huge 20 meter steel columns into place.  After successfully lifting one column we were sure that the second column can be lifted.  But after the column was lifted from a horizontal position to a diagonal position the cables of the crane gave way and the column, which was around 5 meters from the truck came crashing down to the ground.  Although the supposed danger came from implementation rather than design, the risk is still there.  Architecture is not just drawing afte all.  It involves logistical nightmares like this.  You should have seen how the large bridge girders flew from the ground to it's final position at the top of the columns.  THAT was scary.  ______________  On another side of construction and design, I recently went to the mountains of Antipolo along with a landscape architect friend for a potential client.  The house under construction is notable for the various wood species used for the trimmings, counters, cladding and surface treatment.  Pine, birch, narra...I forgot the rest.  No tanguile or yakal for this project.  I was honest with the client that I don't know the materials he used, since these are rare materials.  I was eager to learn there and then, to see how these wood species look, feel, smell and taste.  Yes, some architects know wood by their taste, by licking the wood itself.  Hmmm yummy...well I guess I'll just ask for samples from him later.  It goes to show that I have a lot to learn again.  ______________  So much for my yearning to enter a corporate archi firm were I get to learn high end finishes and techno-savvy equipment.  I guess I have to learn first more from the basics.  Where's a mentor when you need one?

       CROSS COUNTRY, CROSS BORDERS part 1   Nope, I did not go on a cross country tour of the Strong Republic, we just went on a weekend get-away to the southern portions of Luzon.  Thanks to the graciousness of the Great Punx, members of the former Firm went to the highlands of Tagaytay for an overnight celebration of his having passed the board exam.  We then proceeded on a last-minute decision to go swimming in Batangas.  The result was a strong comparison of what it was to live inside the metro and in the far reaches of the mainland.  The adventure took place in the highways of Metro Manila to the stretches of Southern Luzon.  ____________  Due to obligations to my high school batch, I went ahead and attended a meeting for our highschool reunion in our home city of Parañaque.  I was to meet the group at the Jollibee branch near the Sucat Toll Exit.  I preferred to meet them at the ubiquitous insect franchise since it is very easy to spot from the tollway, and very quick to access from the expressway.  But alas, the “expressway” has its limits, as our transport made a wrong turn to the “service” road, resulting in the appreciation of south Luzon traffic.  It took the group 3 hours to meet up with me at Alabang, the new meeting place, since they did not dare go on using the service road to Sucat.  All familiarity of the beloved South Luzon Expressway faded, and I was filled with wonder as to why there was such a  build up in the SLEX.  It was almost 10 years when I suffered the same fate at the same traffic artery, with the absence of the then built Skyway.  But then it took me 5 hours of traffic hell.  ______________  Moving on, after I met up with the now weary group, I hopped on to the back of the pick up with Jeck and Robert apparently enjoying the wind (pollution) of Metro Manila.  But upon exiting Alabang and entering Laguna, the pollution lightened up and we all knew that we were going to enjoy a few minutes of fresh wind on our faces.  And it did take us only minutes!  We were in Tagaytay in less than one hour.   The group then went on a dinner treat of bulalo and rice at a roadside eatery.  Large bowls of bulalo was served, and we had our fill of hot soup and tasty beef.  The only bother we encountered was the large cat begging for a bite of our meal.  And I do mean large.  They don’t breed cats like those in Manila.  It must be the fresh air.  Then came the espasol girls, selling the group espasol minus the e, with their goods labeled “spasol”.  With nothing else to do but relax, I guess our observation skills must be in full force.  Jeck tried his bola skills to get rid of the girls, but the girls must have been trained better in the art of counter-bola:   Jeck: Ay sorry hindi puede yan sa akin kasi me allergic ako jan e….”    Girl: E ser mas gagaling nga kayo pag kumain kayo nito e…    Jeck: E bawal din sa relihiyon ko yan e…”    Girl: E ser wala naman pong kinalaman ang relihiyon nyo sa pagkain nito e…”   This is not verbatim, but I guess it was hilarious enough for us to remember it later.  _______________  The only leg of the trip left was the travel to the Punx’ residence in Tagaytay.  After a short drive along the cliffs of Tagaytay we finally found the complex.  After entering the compound’s gate, I called the Punx and he asked us to turn left down to the lower parts of the cliff. The problem was there was no left, only a right to a dark roadway.  With all of us noisily climbing down the back of the pickup and having entered the WRONG compound, we all expected shotguns pointed at us.  Good thing we haven’t pitched camp first before calling, or else we might have been accused of trespassing.  ________________  At last we have arrived at the Focolare compound with no bullet holes or axe cuts.  It has been almost three years since I first entered the compound, and with some degree of familiarity to the place and the Punx’ family, we happily entered the house.  We met the Punx’ other friends and colleagues at the Focolare movement.  And what a group indeed!  There were a variety of nationalities present in the event, with Malaysians, Germans, Spanish, Portuguese present.   After a few minutes of drinking beer and eating barbecue, we proceeded to give a toast for the Punx, with pure lambanog being the drink!  The group then proceeded with short impromptu performances from each nationality with the aid of the guitar.  Robert was up first, and due to the lack of knowledge of any kundiman, we ended up singing Pare Ko by the Eraserheads.  The guitar was eventually passed on to me, and with no other guitar piece memorized, I ended up playing a few Beatles songs.  The highlight of the performance was the Spanish (or was it Portuguese?) singing a Spanish song along with some Spanish style guitar playing.  The Malaysian also tried to play a few songs, with his demeanor reminding me of the F4 people.  ___________________  The group then pitched camp along the side of the house, and since I don’t plan to get drunk or stay up late since I have to study tomorrow for an exam for my masters, I decided to sneak in the tent and sleep early.  Good thing I didn’t join in the lambanog consumption session, I heard Mr. Malaysian got very drunk and ended up puking later on.  Ah, cross borders, cross nationalities…there’s more…      WE NEED SWIMMING SHORTS…. Cross Country Cross Borders part 2   After a few photo ops at the mountains of Tagaytay, we then proceeded to the beaches of Batangas for some last minute swimming.  We decided to but some cheapo swimming shorts at the market in Tagaytay, and we easily got three shorts for a hundred pesos.  All that was left was to eat lunch and then it’s the beach for us!  I suggested we eat at the Mushroom Burger joint, since I haven’t tried the burgers yet.  It was good, for a fungus.  After leaving the joint, we had a little stopover at the side of the road, since one of us forgot her packed fungus spaghetti at the Mushroom Burger.  It was later on to be called the Spaghetti Incident and became a small joke for us at the back of the pickup, whenever we try to remember things we forgot to do before leaving for Batangas. _________________  And so it was the beach for all of us!  We ended up in Jigs’ Auntie’s resort, which has a very nice view, and very nice waves.  There were the mountains near the shoreline, and large waves splashing along the waters.  Since it was the middle of July, there was nobody but us at the beach.  We hooked up with a bunch of local boys swimming at the beach, which we suspect tried to hit on our comrade who we would later call Elementary Levels.  After swimming we decided to go to the less frequented places in the beach.  We tried to walk along the shallow areas of the beach full of sea urchins and small sharp stones, without footwear!  Reminiscent of the bogs where Frodo and Gollum walked minus the ghosts, we successfully walked around the area, and back to the swimmable areas.  It was were we found out that our precious cheapo shorts were all ripped open, exposing more sensitive areas of skin. At least we got pictures wearing the shorts before and after ripping.  So much for supporting the local industry.  __________________  The rest of the trip was spent taking pictures of ourselves windswept at the back of the pickup, trying to capture a nice sunset and taking pictures of the countryside.  But all things must come to an end, as we returned to the urban jungles of Manila.   Now we’re back in our polluted-concrete covered havens.  Hope the next out of town gimmick happens soon.  It was fun escaping from it all.  I heard Bulacan is up next.  Ilocos anyone?  Baguio?  Boracay?
