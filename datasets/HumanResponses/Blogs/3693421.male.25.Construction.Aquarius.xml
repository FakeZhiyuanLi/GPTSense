      I cut myself while shaving last night, like 5 minutes before we had to leave for meeting, and I just could not get it to stop bleeding.  So I am sitting there in the Kingdom Hall parking lot feeling like an idiot trying to get my face to stop leaking so I can go inside.  I finally end up just driving home and putting a bandage on myself, which looks pretty stupid but oh well.  When I finally get back to the bookstudy I am like 15 minutes late and I go in, it had been raining so the parking lot was all wet and my shoes got water somwhere in the soles and would not stop squeaking.  I squeak my way in and find a seat when I realize that the brother reading is also working the mike (we use a mic at bookstudy because people who can't leave their homes call in and listen).  I feel so bad for not being there so I take over the mikes.  So there I am, working the mikes, squeaking from person to person with a stupid looking bandaid right on my face.  Oh well.  I plan on going to see Spider-Man 2 with Chris, Kristina, John and some friends tonight, I will let you all know what I thought tommorow.  It looks great, and I have high hopes.

      Progress on my site has been happening at a fast and furious pace, and I am nearing completion of the initial layout and have already added lots of content.    I am about to start work on a secret web project for a friend, and I am very excited about it.  I will share more if I ever can, but it is a big challenge for me, and I will learn immensely from it.    The rain has been an almost constant downpour for the last two weeks.  Work has been at a standstill at the building site (also known as the swamp of despair), although hopes are high that things will dry off enough for the concrete to be poured this weekend.  If it's not, then the spanish congregation could find themselves doing the concrete work all alone the following weekend since we have our District Convention that weekend.  I am looking forward to the convention, it will be our first time to have it in Bryan/College Station, and hanging out in a new city is always cool.

      I have so many projects in the works.  I am working on a granite web site for work, working on the official company web site, working on building snowkrash.com, trying to read Neuromancer, learning from a new Macromedia Dreamweaver MX book I got (the program rocks and I want to master it), all that, and I am still trying to find time to go out and do stuff.    With all the web site work I am doing I am really missing a broadband connection.  It drives me crazy that I have moved 3 times in the last 3 or 4 years and nowhere I ever move has any broadband options.  It seems everyone I know here in Conroe has broadband except my neighborhood.  Well, since we are looking to move once again to somewhere else in Conroe, my new #1 requirement is a FREAKING broadband connection!  I need to just get a laptop already and start spending more time at Panera Bread with their free WiFi.  That of course, would have a very bad effect on both the pocket book and the waist line (and neither of those can take any more hits.)

      Work was pretty slow today, which is pretty nice.  One of the guys got a new cell phone today, the Nextel i730, and now I am jealous.  Its really a cool phone, with voice dialing and Java apps, GPS, the whole bundle.  I am thinking about doing something to upgrade as well.  I will look at options when we go to the mall tommorow.

      It took me a while, but I finally found a really good free Message board site.  www.activeboard.com is the best I have found, it works really nicely.  Check it out if you want an easy to set up, configure and implement message board system for your website.

      Our new Kingdom Hall continues to procees of being built, and oh what a slow process it is.  There has been so much rain lately that the whole site is basicly a giant mudpit, yet work continues.  Next weekend we are supposed to start pouring the slab for the foundation.  John and I spent the night at the site once again last night doing securtity, and slept about the same as usual, in other words, very little.  We really don't mind though, because we at least know we are helping out.  I will be posting pictures soon.

      Just started using Gmail, and I am loving it.  I have avoided leaving Pop email for Web based for a long time, and for personal use, I think I am finally making the switch.  All of my jason@snowkrash.com is now going into my Gmail account.  Boy do I love the search feature!  You guys just wait, its great.  If I get any invites I will spread the love.

      My friend Richard from Louisiana came down this weekend and stayed with us.  We had a blast.  Mainly we played COH and jammed to all the cool MP3's I have been downloading from AllofMp3.com, a nifty little russian music site that sellls mp3's for only 1 cent a MB.  You heard right, 1 freaking cent!  You really should check it out.

      Things are going really well with the site now, expect to be up and have real content during this next week.  Also, trying to get a Gmail account from some nice person out there  in Internet land via www.gmailswap.com, a really cool and creative idea.  Can you help a fellow geek out?

      Way too much of my time is now spent playing City of Heroes, a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing game).  In it, you can create your own comic book super hero to adventure with.  I know, super geeky, but crazy fun.  Look for me on the Infinity server as Snowkrash or Healatron.  Man I need to get a life....  Oh well.

      It is so amazingly frustrating to be stuck without a broadband option.  I wish I never even tasted to sweet goodness that is a cable modem, if I hadn't I wouldn't hate Dial up so very much.  With a passion.  Seriously.

      I am getting really frustrated with Nvu as my web software, I am downloading the trial version of Dreamweaver MX now to see how that works for builfing my site.  I have past experience with Frontpage and kind of liked that, so we will see how this works.  If its no good I will probably end up just going back to Frontpage, as much as I want to avoid using it.

      Guess we will see how well this here works, looks interesting to say the least.  I am kind of curious how it will fit into the rest of my website, as to whether I can mess around with the design scheme or some just incorporate it into a frame.  We will see I guess.  Jason

      Just want to let everyone know I have not disappeared.  Work has been crazy busy lately and my computer at home is still down.  It will be fixed very soon and I will be back to updating the site.  I have loads of pictures to add to the site.  It has actually been pretty boring over here lately though, the kingdom hall build site continues to progress.  We just poured half the parking lot, John and I are still working security 2 times a week.  We are worried that we will be losing the security camper soon tho, which may mean we will be stuck sleeping in the car, which is not something we are looking forward too.  I will talk to you all again very soon, let's just hope Monitor Depot treats me right....

      I haven't really had time to blog lately, my monitor on my computer at home went out and thats where I usually work on the web site.  I should be replacing it very soon though, so the updates will start up again soon.  We have been having Dietra and Josh, 2 of the kids from our congregation staying with us over the last 2 weeks while there mom is visiting a friend.  It has really been great fun!  Dietra is 16 so she has been helping out around the office alot and Josh is 10, and he is just the most interesting and creative kid you will ever meet.  He is an artist and draws really awesome for his age.  We are all going to the mall tonight to get comics, so that should be fun as usual.  I will be back here regualrly soon!

      Wow.  What a weekend.  This last Friday, Saturday, and Sunday we spent at the 2004 District Convention, "Walk With God".  The family and I traveled back and forth between Conroe and Bryan (a bit over an hours drive).  We are traveled with another family in the truck, Diana and her two kids, Deitre and Josh.  Boy did we have a great time!  It was so nice traveling with good friends like that, it really added alot to the whole experience.  The talks were all great, several really stood out as very touching and very important for the times.  Josh, who just turned 10, got baptized.  The baptism talk was very touching and the speaker was really talking to the baptism candidates directly the whole time.  I worked with the attendants helping to direct the baptism and guide the people where they needed to go.  After helping direct our new brothers and sisters back to the dressing room to get changed I was put as one of the brothers holding a rope that was used as kind of a barrier to help give them a path to follow.  Well Josh comes out and he is just so adorable, he is tiny and thin and all smiles as he gets baptized.  I am there among ten other brothers on the rope and they are all talking about how cute this little brother is, and I was just beaming with pride because he is like my own little brother.  The local newspaper was there and the next day on the front page of the local section was a big full color picture of one of our new brothers coming up out of the water after being baptized.  There were 2 new releases, one on Friday and one on Saturday.  I will post scans of both the covers with a spoiler warning, so dont look if you dont want to be spoiled.  Saturday after the session we wanted to go out to eat to celebrate Josh's baptism, so we went to a Chineese restraunt.  While we were there Diana decided to try using our first new release, since it is specially made for those who speak other languages.  Our waitress was Chineese, and although she spoke some english it was obvious she was more comfortable speaking Chineese.  So we got the new release and used it, and set up a return visit for the next afternoon to come back and bring her a Require brochure and a Bible in her own language.  We were all so excited about this so Sunday at lunch we told the experience to the brothers in Administration, and they asked Diana to write up the experience for them.  She did, and we were all thrilled when during the last talk of the convention they read her experience to everyone!   That afternoon we went back to the restraunt and met up with the waitress and Diana gave her the Bible and brochure, she was touched and appreciative.  There were several brothers from Bethel at the convention who gave wonderful talks, and we even had a brother from the Governing body who gave several talks during the three days!  At one point there was a talk about the light getting brighter and brighter and the changes that we as an organization have made over the years as we have come to a greater understanding of things.  The highlight of this talk was two brothers they interviewed who have been in the truth for over 65 years each!  These brothers experiences were so very heartfelt and touching, after each brother finished the clapping went on and on, everyone around was close to tears.  The brother giving the talk said that our heartfelt applause had used up all the time (it went on for what seemed like several minutes for each brother).  Look for pictures from the convention and scans of the new releases covers here on the site over the next few days.  In closing I will just say this has been one of the best conventions I have ever atteneded (although I am sure I will say the same next year).  Traveling with friends the way we did, even though it was cramped (we had 8 all together) it was so wonderful to share the experience the way we did.  Every day on the drive home we would sing kingdom songs the whole way and the time passed like nothing.  If you have not yet been to your convention you are in for quite a treat.  Pay attention, take notes, and enjoy.

      Well, it's been a few days since I was able to blog. I had a verrry busy weekend.  Friday night I went out with some friends,  hit the bookstore and comic shop.  I bought a book on Monet, the guy has some talent I tell ya. Saturday the family worked out on the construction site, I slept in in preperation for working security that night, and then worked all day Sunday at the site. I took some more pictures as well, those are going to be posted soon.  We got the foundation laid, finally.  Things are really coming along.  Monday we only worked half a day and then we went to Houston and did some shopping, stopped off for Chinese food on the way home.  I was thrilled with the selection of Sushi, one of my favorite foods of all time.  They even had Oyster on the half shell, something I haven't had since Louisiana.  Monday night John and I worked securtity again, then Tuesday was a very busy day at work making up for the extended weekend.  Tuesday night we ended up having to spend another night on security because someone didn't show up.  It's now Wednesday evening and I am gearing up for the District Convention this weekend.  Yeah, its been a busy couple a' days.  I wouldn't want it any other way.

      I went and saw Spider-Man 2 last night.  Wow.  Let me add a second, Wow.  One of the best sequels to a summer action flick I have ever seen.  I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of plot and character progression, besides the breathtaking action and jaw dropping special effects.  The underlying theme of the movie was definitely the relationship between Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Tobey Maguire).  The acting in these scenes was heartfelt and touching, a nice change to an action summer movie.    There is a scene towards the middle of the movie which is one of the most exciting action sequences ever seen as Spider-Man battle Doc Ock on a raised rail train and then must stop the out of control train as it speeds towards certain doom.  Classic comic action that could have easily come off as cheesy, but it didn’t.  After you finally catch your breath from that you are touched by the sentiments of those he saved, again, it should have been corny, but somehow, it just wasn't.  The final thing I really appreciated was the attention to detail paid to the character personalities.  The writers, Miller & Gough (creators of Smallville), obviously know the characters of Peter Parker and Mary Jane and they stay true to their comic book counterparts, a rarity in comic book movies where the characters are often written to fit whatever the movie execs "think" they should be.  Mary Jane is not just some damsel in distress always needing a rescue, and Peter Parker is not just some superhero whose only reason for being is saving lives.  All in all, well done.  4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.  And on another note, after the movie everyone pretty much just went home since we had gone to the nighttime showing.  For some reason after watching a movie like that I just can't stand to go back home and do nothing, I had to just do something.  Unfortunately, there just aren't enough options around here.  I drove around for a while at around 11:30, not wanting to go to bed, and not wanting to just walk around Wal-Mart.  Well, I walked around Wal-Mart.  I know, I know, try and hold back your excitement; I can barely contain myself as I type it.  Did you know there are DVD players as cheap as $38 dollars now?  Yeah, me neither.  I need more options.
