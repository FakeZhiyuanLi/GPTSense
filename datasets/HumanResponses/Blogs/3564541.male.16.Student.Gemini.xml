      My "band" got in its first fight tonight. mostly because caleb and i are mostly in it for fun, and the good times right. and for some reason dan steve and josh, all decided to be dicks, so we got in a little fight!! i felt kinda excited actually, but overall it was sucky, then we went and gave Mackenzie her annuall rose from a gas station, thats become a tradition. she is really pretty now, and caleb likes her a lot, so thats fun. we went to the beach to play some songs, and it started raining, and it sucked. so we went to my grandma and grandpas garage, and then we got in our fight. i really cant wait to see spiderman 2. i think that the new morrissey cd is his best solo stuff. and it excites me thoroughly. i cant believe i didnt go to coachella. and for lallapolooza that idea kinda fell threw. stupid people not buying tickets. i am going to see morrissey this summer though, im determined. i really like belle and sebastian. i really cant stop listening to them. and the beta band and the moment, which is wierd cause in high fidelity they listen to both of those bands in the record store... but i must say my top 5 bands right now are:  1. bright eyes 2. pavement 3. modest mouse 4. radiohead 5. belle and sebastian   top 5 tv shows:  1. my so called life 2. degrassi 3. freeks and geeks 4. family guy 5. beavis and butthead  top 5 movies i want to see:  1. napolean dynomyte 2. spiderman 2 3. Fahrenheit 9/11 4. Anchorman 5. the villiage  haha that was fun.   bad santa is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen period. its good enough to buy. which is pretty serious with me these days. secret window was a huge disspointment, johnny depp rocked in it, but that goes without saying, the ending was terrible and it runied the entire movie, horrible film, with a horrible horrible ending. john turturro was awesome as well, but again that goes without saying.    continued....   top 5 albums of all time:  1. bright eyes- lifted or the story is in the soil keep your ear to the ground 2. Nirvana-nevermind 3. pavement-slanted and enchanted 4. fugazi-13 songs 5. brand new-deja entendu   i really dont think that would be the same tommorow. but im confident that lifted... is the best album ever recorded.    well im done for now. be cool stay in school.

      The Pistons beat the Lakers, and that made me really happy, they did it the day before my birthday, and now im 16, as of june 16th, it was my golden birthday, and i got a lot of cool stuff. but i wont get my license for about a month, but i could really care less. i saw dodgeball, and it was a huge dissapointment, vince vaughn who effing rocks, was retarted in it, i dont blame him though. the only thing that saved it was the cameos, and ben stiller. zoolander is on right now and that is such a better movie, its ridiculous. JFK is a really great movie as well. club dread was kinda a disspointment, but it was still funny. super troopers is better. i really miss my better half. its getting pretty sad. i met these really cool girls last night, and 3 of the 4 were sisters, and they were up here from detroit cause they have a house up here, and they were really cool, great taste in music and movies, and whatnot. summer is really kinda boring. i got  a really cool promise ring shirt, and an even cooler thursday shirt. i think that i had a crush on one of those girls last night, which really hasnt happened to me in a long time. but makes me happy nonetheless.   im currently listening to a lot of, rilo kiley, at the drive in, the cure, the beta band, belle and sebastian, yo la tengo, the velvet underground, the promise ring, pavement, nada surf, sonic youth, my bloody valentine, morrissey, modest mouse, and built to spill. if you came over i would bet lots of money one of those bands would be playing.

      I watched the movie Basic last night, and i actually liked it, i mean i think the end was a little much, but it was still cool, lots of twists and turns, that are pretty nuts. and john travolta was really good in it. so was samuel l jackson, but hes always good. i also watched natural born killers, which i used to hate, but now i think its ok, i really dont like violence, so its hard to like it. but the acting is so good, and its so different, and unique i suppose i like it. i really cant believe the pistons lost game 2, they have to win tonight. whoever wins tonight will win the series. you heard it here first.   I'm going bowling tonight, and ive only been bowling like twice in the past 5 years. but i did really good last time, so it should be fun. im buying a synthesizer, and i am gonna get tickets for lallapolooza.

      well, i finally made a blog, because livejournal was just not a good time anymore. and im not to proud of it right now, but that should change with time. its 5:35 a.m. and im not too tired, but i still wish i wasnt awake, and could sleep. the pistons beat the lakers, haha stupid shaq and kobe. and payton and malone for that matter. i have to go get my football pads at the high school at around 9:00. yeah football is already starting, and it sucks. i need to get a job. im reading the book "the curious incident of the dog in the night time." by mark haddon, and its actually really good, im suprised.

      so gus macker was over the weekend which is a basketball tournement, and it was a lot smaller than most years, but it was still fun.&nbsp; the pistons championship trophy was there and i touched it, that was really awesome.&nbsp; sunday i didnt go though, because i went to visit dan at band camp. it was guest day there and neither of his parents were going so i went with steve-o and josh.&nbsp; it was about a 2 and a half hour drive to kalamazoo, where western michign university is.&nbsp; but we made great time. it only took us like an hour on the way back. see dans camp is really just like going to college for 2 weeks, being a music major, you stay in a dorm, and take all the classes you would take, its really cool actually.&nbsp; so we went there and went out to eat at bilbos, which is where my parents ate all the time when they were in college, and its a lord of the rings themed pizza place, they had awesome pizza. and then we just hung out in the dorms with all of his friends, and he showed us around the campus, it was fun.&nbsp; and so i fixed my cd burner today, and i can burn cd's again. which makes me happy, because i really need to get some music off of my computer.&nbsp; i burned a rilo kiley, and a rainer maria cd today.&nbsp; i have been listening to a lot of joy division, i really like them a whole lot. that and the jesus and mary chain, the smiths, the cure,&nbsp; sigur ros, and radiohead.&nbsp; ted leo sounds just like elvis costello, and i think that is awesome. he is just different enough for it to be alright.&nbsp; i want to see napolean dynomite and the villiage pretty bad, i think im gonna go see i, robot tommorow night cause a bunch of people are, so hmmm whatever.&nbsp; i was dreading football, now im semi looking forward to it.&nbsp; its starts on monday.&nbsp; its finally getting hot out.   michael ian black is the funniest man alive.  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      so i watched mystic river with my mom tonight and it was really good. i really liked it. i have my doubts about clint eastwood as a director though. the acting was amazing, and so was just about everything else about the movie, nevermind clint eastwood is a great director. i really dont think it was the best movie of the year though. sean penn was the best in it, but tim robbins was really good in it too. so was that effing guy that played smalls in the sandlot! he was awesome. i havent seen him in anything besides the sandlot but he is a good actor.  i like the book the prince of tides, when i read it at the beginning of the school year i hated it, but i do like it i decided. i bought it at a used book sale, cause it was only 50 cents and i like it. i really do like ole tom wingo. i almost own every kurt vonnegut book now. he migh be my favorite author of all time. jd salinger still is my favorite i suppose, but vonnegut is making a good run at being my favorite. i also bought on the road by jack kerouac, and i have only read a little but i like it so far.  i have been giving the whole election thing a lot of thought, and although i stay out of most political arguments, because i dont really know to much about politics, i really do think that bush is a moron and i hate him. he has never done anything that i like ever. and i dont like any politicians really. kerry may not be the answer but he is definatley better then bush, and will be the answer for now. i cant handle another 4 years of bush. kerry is the man at the moment. its just all the smartest people i know support kerry and are completely against bush. so i have no reason to doubt that bush is a complete moron.  i saw anchorman and the terminal too. anchorman was really funny, exaclty what i expected. but the terminal was great, one of my favorite feel good movies i have ever seen, tom hanks is amazing. i love it. i watched party monster last night, and frankly it was horrible. maculay culkin was terrible in it. and i kinda liked seth green but it was just a horrid horrid movie. it could have been really good and interesting but it was the exact oppisite. i watched it with dan, my companion on opinons. and he thought the same. we agree on about 90% of things, and almost all books, movies, and music. he left for band camp the morning for 2 weeks. incidentally i will miss him very much. football starts in 2 weeks, so i have to start preparing for that. i also have to try to think as little about it as possible, and do as much as i can before it starts. the first month or so is just hell.  i have been listening to at the drive in and fugazi a lot lately. i have also been listening to a lot of desparacidos. as well as the smiths and my bloody valentine. shoegazers? i dont really understand the whole shoegazers thing, ill have to look into it. damn good music anyways. some of the best ive heard in a while. also the cure, joy divison, and interpol have been listend to quite a bit by me. great summer music. weezer and pavement are still the best summer music. jasmine says so.    ****i wrote this post once, and i somehow lost it so i had to quickly rewrite it off the top of my head, its ok i suppose****

      the 4th of july is the biggest holiday for my family and myself. we have our friends from new york come up and stay every year, and others, from all over the place, even people we dont want to come, and dont invite, but we dont care, atleast i dont. anyhow we have been doing this for my whole life im pretty sure, and lots of people come to ludington anyways, because its right on the beach, and we have a big parade, and fireworks. and my house is right on the road of the parade, and by the beach, where the fireworks are, so what im saying is there are always tons of people at my house on the 4th of july. and we always have a big jam at jim schafers house, and bands play there, and there is tons of people, and i have been going to that since i was like 8 even though the main purpose is for everyone to get drunk. and we usually have a softball game, that everyone plays in and that is really fun, but we didnt this year, and we dont every year, cause it doesnt always work out. that is always fun to. but anyways, most of my freinds had to work atlest part of the day on the 4th, and a lot of them never came to my house, and for the 2nd year in a row i didnt have a very good 4th. last year was just insane and i would rather not talk about it. this year it rained on and off the whole day, and it wasnt nice when it wasnt raining, and it was so foggy during the fireworks you could hardly see them. and i wish everyone didnt think they were to cool for everything, it pisses me off. to cool for the parade, or fireworks, or the 4th of july in general, or anything. the 4th just makes it more apparent that people think they are to cool for things. the only reason im really writing all of this is because i didnt get to see one person on the 4th, and i really really wanted to. so. everyone left, from new york i mean. and the 5th of july sucks, cause everyone leaves and i just sit around all day every year, all by myself. i for the most part never left my room today, i watched the movie singles, and watched baseball. and i was so terribly bored all day, and i still am. ony wednesday i went to michigan adventures, and got a tan and mostly stayed in the waterpark all day, but my freinds made me go on all the roller coasters, which i hardly ever do, and it wasnt too fun, the roller coasters i mean. dan said he was gonna come over today and he never did, and he never called either, which sucks. and i hate the 5th of july.  spiderman 2 was awesome. great great movie, best movie i have seen in a long time. it didnt let me down at all. great performences all around specially by alfred molina. it definatley made me want them to make a 3rd, and i hate sequals.   we played our first gig as a band, it was ok im not really in the band. atleast i wasnt then. i need to get good at guitar. or something.   i think thats it for now, how soon is now by the smiths really is a great song, and it kinda sucks cause its pretty much there only famous song, but it is good nonetheless. i hate the 5th of july.
