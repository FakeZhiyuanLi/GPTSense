      Well I've decided that Monday will be the big day at work where I'll put my two weeks notice in.  I'm so over working in the computer industry.  Never again will I have a job where I sit in front of a computer screen and work in a cubicle all day. I'm taking the next three months off from working entirely and will start looking for a job sometime in September.

      So,  urlLink Demi Moore  seems to be the media darling of late, and why not? She's 40 and hot (and dating whatishisname from that 70's show. Not lady green's type exactly but hey, go for it girl...). Everyone seems to think that injections of some sort are involved, but lady green disagrees. But Demi's current look is quite different from her GI Jane days, no doubt. Push ups anyone?

      The custom in Germany, when raising one's glass in a toast, is to look the person in the eye while clinking glasses. If you do not, apparently you will have to suffer seven years of bad sex (lady green learned this from some German lesbians that she had too many drinks with last night....). This, of course, is unacceptable. So, keep that gaze steady, kids!

      There was a time when lady green was quite envious of celebrities. And why not, when they've got the bling-bling-n-shit? But we all get old, even the filthyfuckingrich Madonna.

      Today was my last full day of work. I came home and cranked up the AC as its hotter than hell here. Turned on the TV put a favorite movie in the VCR and settled in to take a break. Not five minutes into the movie a fuse blows. Every outlet in my apartment it tied to a single 15 amp fuse. AC kicked on and poof! I rummage around and find a penny fuse that fits and all is well. Except that now my VCR is having an epileptic seizure and no longer responding to command. I fucked with it for like 10 minutes before I got out the screwdriver. and of course they don't come apart easily and I was getting really pissed because the fucking thing had eaten one of my favorite animes (not available on DVD by the way). so what the screwdriver wouldn't remove the pliers and hammer did and I think I salvaged all but a few seconds of my movie. The VCR however did not survive. (Times when I wish I had a digital camera). I put all the parts back in it and screwed the case back on. looks fine from the outside! I ended up rigging up the TV just so I can watch cable on it and then the fucking remote isn't working for it. The worst thing is that I still have to go out and buy a new VCR. WTF!

      Indeed there is a cure a broken heart. Some people reach for  urlLink music.   Some people go for  urlLink self-love . And yet some others head straight for  urlLink baseball.  Personally, Lady Green likes all of these things. A good  urlLink stiff martini  never hurts either.

      Frog Jobs for everyone! "Sometimes, while out in the exercise area, you might catch a frog. We'd take these back to our cells and have frog parties. We'd work out an order and take turns to insert the frog down there [in the vagina that is]. The frog starts to panic and jumps around everywhere. It feels really good," Momoko says. "You've got to be careful, though, because sometimes you can squeeze to hard and that suffocates the frog. There used to be really big fights among the girls when that happened."

      New to this town (Boston) and been here a little over a week. In getting around I have already come across three (3!) huge splats of  urlLink vomit.   What the hell is up with that? And this is no lightweight spray we're talkin about, we're talkin three course meals. Gee, is it something about bean town that makes people want to yak?

      Art schmart. If you have the chance, get your art-lovin' arse to the  urlLink Met  to see the Manet-Velasquez show (closes 29June). Some of the best paintings you will ever see. Manet comes out looking like a pansy-ass, but what can you expect from a 19th c frenchie. Sacre bleu!

      The highlight of my trip to Boston was definitely 'Lesbian Quizzo'. I walked into this bar in Sommerville called 'The Thirsty Scholar' on Sunday night that looked like a sports bar, however it didn't take long to realize that beside the bartender and few guys hanging out in the corner the entire place was filled with lesbians! Girls hugging each other, kissing, groping, arm wrestling, showing off tatoos, and all while playing  urlLink Quizzo . And yeah, there were a few scary dyke lesbians but for the most part they were freaky and hot! Come on  urlLink Suicide Girls !  50 drunk-man-hating lesbos can be intimidating but oddly enticing.  still, even under pressure I made the male race proud in Quizzo.

      Well since nothing interesting happened today aside from the fact that I had Hazelnut coffee and honey nut cheerios for breakfast I thought I'd start the week off by finding a decent link.  Check out  urlLink FAQ's for Fatties!  The question titled "what can be done about discomfort in hot sticky weather" and the associated answer of "wear lycra" has me undecided as to whether this site is for real or just satire. you be the judge you ham-fisted pork pocket!

      technical note: The Blogger.com backend is all coded in CSS which is new to me. Up until today the front-end was in HTML using tables and inline frames, not exactly the most scalable solution. So today I learned some basic CSS and recoded the entire site. I am pretty satisfied with the results, mainly that you shouldn't notice any changes in the layout and the inline frame is gone.  There are still a few minor layout tweaks that need to be addressed and the code is not yet 100% CSS compliant but I'm working on it. drop me a line if you notice anything funky.

      Met this great girl at a party tonight. she was incredibly smart, very pretty, into Art, about my age and lives nearby. we really seemed to have a lot of common interests.  of course, she has a boyfriend.  I even diliberately stayed sober so as not to make an ass of myself. oh well perhaps things won't work out with the boyfriend, lets consult 'magic 8 ball.' Magic 8 ball says 'signs point to yes' Guess there is hope for Bobo yet, 'outlook not good' Damn, stupid magic 8 ball ^_^

      Bobo went and saw  urlLink Cowboy Bebop: The Movie  tonight at  urlLink The Charles .  There were only about ten people in the theatre and Bobo was the only one by himself. Then this pretty girl came in by herself at sat next to Bobo.  Bobo really liked the movie, great story and classic Bebop dialogue. But the movie reminded Bobo a lot of his ex-girlfriend and the things they used to share. One scene in particular where Ein, the welsh corgie, walks around with a jack-o-lantern on his head while radical Edward dances and sings in the middle. By the end of the movie Bobo was sad and when the pretty girl tried to catch his attention he ignored her. And he went home and felt sorry for himself; sorry for what he had lost and he knew that he was a fool.

      Its official, I quit! In two weeks I will be unemployed and well on my way to starting my new career as 'struggling artist.' and I couldn't be happier.  They would have offered me quite a pay raise to stay but my resolve remained steadfast and I refused.  I only hope that I made the right decision.  in three months after I sell my computer on ebay and the site goes dark you'll know how it worked out.

      Todays fortune cookie: 'You will soon receive an unusual gift,' in bed:) he he.  I'm gonna save my christmas dollars and buy myself some boobies! In other news I was unable to quit today as my boss worked from home.  I was tempted to tell him via email, very tempted, but I thought now is not the time to burn bridges. My co-workers disagreed, they felt a flash animation of my head yelling "i quit" over and over to be quite acceptable. yea (as in the biblical 'yea'), morale is at an all time low.  Oh yeah, I told all of them. they were surprised but the crazy thing was that two of them were about to quit as well.  considering that there are only four people in my department my absence alone will be felt. at any rate I'm not turning back from my destiny.  I set up a meeting tues. am with the big man.  soon my dreams of becoming a $tarfucks barista will come true.  All your espresso are belong to us.

      And if the weekend couldn't get any worse with the shitty weather and all Shumi didn't win the Monte Carlo F1.  what a pisser. He's won there 5 times and always on an odd year so he should have won. Plus a sixth monte win would have tied him with Senna.  I don't really care for montoya but he did drive a flawless race. Ferarri's race was already lost as soon as he qualified.  Shame on you Jean Todt, for shame.

      had a late night in the darkroom printing last night so I woke up a bit tired this morning. Pulled a shot of espresso and then turned on the frothing wand. only instead of frothing my milk, i started to froth my espresso. made quite a mess, it did, espresso doesn't froth it just splatters hot burning caffeine all over your arms and face. finally recovered and got the milk in there and found it to be sour. so i sucked down two shots and chased it with some grapefruit juice. not a great start today.

      rented  Akira Kurosawa's Dreams  tonight since I was home, alone, and not feeling particularly productive. I was really impressed until the sixth? short story, the one about Van Gogh. 1) Martin Scorcese is a director, not an actor.  2) Vincent Van Gogh is never again to be portrayed by Martin Scorcese, ever.  3) The japanese do not understand modern art. sorry but its true. the scenes of some goofy aspiring japanese painter running through a 'blue screen' of Van Gogh's paintings chasing Vincent Van Gogh as portrayed by Martin Scorcese while speaking a mix of Japanese, Scorcese's shitty english, and French (WTF thought Van Gogh was a dutchman myself) all equally bad, very very bad.

      so i wake up in the middle of the night yesterday and saw this greenish glowing light in my bedroom. my first thought is that here comes the alien anal probe or something. then the light goes out and reappears a few seconds later on the other side of the room. a few seconds later it goes out again and reappears at the foot of the bed. now I'm usually pretty out of it when I first wake up and plus I was already halfway in the tank so the old cognitive neurons just weren't firing too well. I slapped my night stand light and start looking around for the aliens. damn thing lights up again on the wall and that's when I see it. It being a fucking lighting bug. well you can bet his greenish glowing ass is now permanently smeared all over one of my walls. The way I figure it is that he snuck in through window AC unit. other bugs have tried before but they just get ejected into my room as little bug bits after they run into the ACs fan. not sure how this one made it but it looks like it was a one way journey.

      Beer #1   Winner My life is meaningless; when drinking beer in the setting of a taste becomes an enjoyable practice, end it all...soon;  This beer is rather enjoyable however; sugary aroma; sweet taste with a slightly bitter after-taste, though not overwhelmingly either (sweet/bitter)  Beer #2 Bobo's ass smell begins to join beer aroma as he has just decided to pass gas for the fourth time during this short taste test;  Deep into my second beer I am curious as to why I got out of bed this morning?  Opting rather to lay pondering existence like most pseudo intellectuals (I think that is what they do)  Beer tastes of back-wash from the homeless man I was forced to avoid on my way to the house; bland and disgusting  Beer #3 Aroma is of Vomit; but on the bright side..most of my friends have abandoned me; thinking me for un-intelligent, true - very true;  decided to abandon my opinions in hopes of withering away into nothingness.  Beer is unusually sweet with a sickening bitter after taste (I likened it to strychnine) which lasts up to and well into the next gulp, which makes stomach feel not-so-good;  may see this one again later in the evening  -  in my own throat as I pass out gasping for breathe  Beer #4 Aroma reminds one of why cheap beer is best left for closet case homosexual Jocks who enjoy vomiting on each other before a find evening of arousing varsity level ass fuck'n - not so good; not even worthy of some existential rant, albeit depressing Junior-College existentialism;  Ahhh Sartre would be proud - whoops, back to reality;  Beer is Horrid, reminds me of a story:     'What the fuck Dad, why not?' Josh, with a huff of air, horse breath 'Watch that language before I watch it for ya' Dad, close set eyes, Jack breath, or Jim 'Failure' Punch to the gut, Josh down hard Back up with swift movement Swallowed teeth, blood pool under foot Dad wallowing in son's mess Proud Jack breath' or was it Jim.

      Last night we did a little "Cheap beer blind taste test" i figure now that I unemployed I'll need to find a less expensive beer to enjoy. so here are the results which were quite surprising I might add:   Beer #1 --  No hop aroma, sweet and full-bodied, mild aftertaste, nice pin point carbonation, not immediately ready to vomit. verdict...tastes like another   Beer #2 --  less hoppy than #1. No flavor whatsoever, didn't even taste like water. designed primarily for use in beer bongs and for shotgunning.   Beer #3 --  First impressions were that it smelled like something that I had definitely vommited up before. It had nice head retention but a lot of off flavors, kinda left a metal spoon taste in your mouth. seem like it would be best suited for beer pong games at college parties. perhaps that's why it smelled familiar?   Beer #4 --  worst smell ever! horrible bouquet. tasted a lot like beer #2. something funky going on in the flavor department but it did have a smooth finish and no off flavors. not too bad.  my rankings and post taste test labels revealed: 1st place beer #1  --  Pabst Blue Ribbon  second place beer #4 --  Carling Black Label  third place beer #2  --  Strohs Original  fourth place goes to beer #3 --  Shaeffer    Tester's comments:  subjects were cooperative and belching was complimentary. researcher indulged in snobby uppity import beer during test. Beer #4 procduced the best belch of the evening.

      There is no solid definition for street cred, at least when you try to explain it to someone from another country.  But lady green is compiling a list of questions that can help you determine what your street cred might be. Stay tuned.

      So i'm trying to print out some proofs for the flyers to advertise my upcoming show.  first the color ink cartridge dies. I run down to office depot and get a new one. $45!!!! for a fucking ink cartridge. but wait it gets better. got home got the color going and then not one page into the print job the black conks out. so its back to office depot. this time $40 for the black cartridge. I swear I didn't even pay more than $120 for the printer. what a fucking ripoff.  I figured while I was out I would pick up some film that I had dropped off last week. I was cleaning my room and found an undeveloped roll from who knows when. well I wish I hadn't wasted the $8.99 to develop it. They were vacation pictures from my beach trip with my now ex-girlfriend last September. just what I felt like looking at. Have a good time at the beach? fuck you!#@$

      Just got back from Sleaside, err I mean Sea Side New Jersey where I was up visiting a friend. Walking down the board walk I spotted a prime example of an Australopithecus and then a Cro-Magnon man complete with gold chains and diamond earings. and some of the trashiest Jersey girls you can imagine to boot! And for the love of god America not all of you were meant to bare skin on the beach. There is a lot of hard living goin' on in jersey and NY and looks like the worst of it ends up in Sleaside.    On the plus side my friend who is from Germany brought me back a bottle of Berentzen Plum, mmmm, plummy. Play the Apfelkorn  urlLink game . Click on the thing that looks like an Apfelkorn bottle with arms and legs and says "Party-Date"

      Bobo has good news and bad news. over the weekend Bobo got accepted to an MFA program at a local college. bad news is that Bobo can't register for classes without having a 'mandatory immunization form' filled out.  why bad news stupid reader ask? cause, bobo has no health insurance, hence no doctor to fill out form. plus bobo has no medical records and doesn't know which doctor even has them (thinking pediatrition, who bobo found is no longer in phone book so is assuming he retired). and stupid student health services are on stupid summer hours so Bobo can't call them but the form is due to them before bobo can register for classes. not making much sense right? This has given bobo a wicked fucking migraine.   in other news bobo needs to move to washington, DC for school now. so if anyone has room in DC for a bobo, please fucking email. Bobo has many traits that make him a valuable roommate. bobo drools on furniture(just like steam cleaning), eats food off the floor (keeps place clean), does not bathe (keeps cost of utilities down), makes funny/rude noises (keeps unwanted girlfriends away), only eats fried food from fast food place (will never eat your food) and likes to sleep in the closet (doesn't even take up a whole room). "Bobo, every house should have one"

      i've been feeling kinda on edge all day. lots of anxiety, shaky hands, not sure what the deal was. just felt a bit off. case of nerves i guess you could say. not even sure what would cause it. I currently don't really have any stress in my life; no job, no girlfriend, no responsibilities (except rent and food and I have that covered for the next few months), i'm being productive as an artist, i'm even sewing a shirt for myself.  I figure now that I have so much free time I should learn to sew, but that is a whole new story and I'll fill you in later. today I learned more about nap, selvage, and basting. i have all these great fashion ideas and i figure that i should start making some shit myself . anyway, back to the nerves thing. not sure what was going on but I went over to a friends house to fix his fiance's computer which she had royally fucked up (through no fault of her own, just a bit of internet naivety). had a glass of port and the nerves diminished, followed by three beers and I felt, well, normal. not the best sign. came home and figured I have a shot (ok, well two) of Black Haus(i give up i can't find a decent fucking link for it, its a blackberry schnapps and pretty strong too) and hopefully be able to fall asleep tonight. did I mention i haven't been sleeping either. like i said, very odd. anyway, down the hatch and off to bed.

      got back from Toronto this afternoon. highlight of the trip was experiencing  urlLink BubbleTea . the plane was even smaller than i expected. it didn't even taxi to the runway. just sorta did a U-turn from the gate and then took off. the propellars were kinda neat though. they spun around and the plane moved forward, fascinating. oh, and the sex store with live models in the windows was cool too.

      rode my  urlLink fixed gear bike  to school for the first time today. quite an adventure. it's about a 4 mile ride and almost all downhill which ended up being scary as shit. riding a bike that can't coast and has only a front brake through rush hour traffic down massachusetts ave. is not the best idea. I was on the brake the whole time and could barely keep my legs going fast enough. the real shitty part was the climb home tonight. it would have been ok with clipless pedals but with regular pedals, jeans, and a pair of campers I could barely push over the 42X16 gear. think i need to find a flatter and less crowded route or at least a freewheel!

      No doubt, kiwi girl, lady green could stand to get laid as well. And sadly for her she lives in the  backwater  of Worcester, MA, where the primary fashion accessory for guys seems to be a visor. Jesus, don't they realize how fucking ridiculous they look?

      Went to my first concert in America last night at the 9.30 club...wasn't my kind of music (read into that country rock)..was standing there for 4 hours drinking my beer just wishing it would hurry up and be over already.   Didn't help that I was hungover and just wanted to crawl into bed (preferably with someone).  Still didn't see any cute American guys...but give it time I guess.  PS - Americans at concerts are so polite....and nobody seemed to be dancing???  This I do not understand.

      Went to the national zoo today with Kiwigirl. here is what I learned: The animals are not at all active on Sunday's at 2PM. most of the exhibits were completely empty or closed anyway. about the only funny thing that happened (asside from Monkey's throwing feces) was a gorilla that was peeing on its hand and then licking it off. and I thought only people liked the  urlLink golden shower !

      watched quite possibly the worst foreign film ever last night. chinese movie called 'the river' about a boy who swims in toxic waste and gets a disease, a gay dad who frequents gay spas, and a prostitute mom who drives around with a porn film director to distribute videos. sounded good, right? well there were like three lines in the whole thing. and the plot never developed nor could i even discern one. though it did make for mystery science theatre 3000 stuff.  urlLink mushi mushi , mushi mush, mushi mushi, mushi mush, mushi mushi, mushi mush.

      I'm starting to lose my excitement about all the cute girls at school. it seems that every nice looking girl in the art department, grad or undergrad, is either married or has a boyfriend. what kind of shit is that?  hopefully this weekend will work out since there is no hurricane, we have power, and the weather is supposed to be good. i've been in DC since sept 1st and have only been out once. just way to fuckin' busy settling in to the new life. wish me luck!

      saw my first presidential motorcade today. walking down penn. ave to class and the sirens start. guys blocking the road with motorcycles and then limos and SUVs come racing down the wrong side of the street. well you can guess that I did what any cold blooded american would do. I grabbed my stick form a nearby tree and started shaking it yelling 'W is America's Savior' as they passed.  Stickman is alive and well and can now be found at the corner of 20th and Eye (right opposite Baja Fresh).

      I was looking over my map of DC with one of my roommates, a DC native from birth, today trying to get a better idea of where things are in the city. I remarked that I never knew that DC had such a large aboretum and aquatic gardens. on the map it appears to take up quite a lot of space. my roommate replies, no DC doesn't have anything like that, but sure enough I showed it to him on the map. his reply, 'oh I see why I had never heard of it, its in the Ghetto. you don't want to go near there, ever, not even in the day.' this coming from the same guy that says southeast actually isn't so bad (during the day anyway). guess its just the national zoo for me.

      Thank the lord! Bobo is back on the air. Stupid bobo moved to Washington DC (tenleytown metro) and new house had no interenet, phone, or cable until three minutes ago.  Two Jamaicans came and hooked it up (plus gave bobo HBO and Showtime cause bobo make the Jamaicans laugh).  oh sweet, sweet internet pornagraphy how I have missed thee. Bobo tried to check email at new stupid school library but too many restrictions on computers to make bobo website update.   Bobo like DC. many fatties to point and laugh at. like the fatties on the metro escalators, "stand right, walk left" they say but the fattie to big to 'stand right'. so fat block whole escalator then everybody have to stand behing lone fattie. 'oh the humanity' they cried.   and Bobo like new school. nice to be graduate student, nice to see pretty girls all over campus, make bobo happy.  so Bobo has many new exciting stories to tell about new life in nation capitol, but that will have to wait for later. luv to my fatties!

      DC mass transit suck ass. something was wrong on the metro tonight (as evidenced by the massive mob with umbrellas standing at the top of the foggy bottom stop) so decided to ride the bus home. now of course you've heard my other rant about the motion sickness but this ones about the timetables. its bad enough that this bus i need only runs four times per day in each direction. what's worse is that the thing has never been on time. it can be as much as 10 minutes early or late. so what should be a 20 minute bus ride ends up with me waiting for the bus for almost 30 minutes just in case its early. plus the fucking drivers don't make change which means tonight's trip cost $2 instead of $1.20. beats standing in the pouring down rain and wind with the jackoffs waiting for whatever was going on with the metro though. don't even get me started on how the so-called  urlLink SmarTrip  card only works on the metro and not the buses.   More than a smart card. It's pure genius.  you're fucking kidding me, right?  Bobo smash stupid metro service.

      had a kick ass day today. got up late, ate cinnamon rolls and drank a latte. headed on down to the  urlLink Hirshhorn  museum to see a talk by  urlLink Ann Hamilton . then sat on the mall and read a book for the afternoon. but then lunch came. I was running late so I thought I'd head over to the student center as a last resort for a fast lunch. everything is super expensive. got all excited for some Taco Bell but of course they fuck you at Taco Bell 'express'. no chalupas, no grilled stuffed burrito, no quesadilla; just taco, taco, taco, burrito, burrito. And I swear that the employees there are all mentally retarded. my burrito looked like it had been folded between to ass cheeks and assembled with nubs not hands. stupid fuckass taco bell.

      decided that I would ride the bus today instead of the metro. waited 40 minutes for a bus that never came. finally got on a different bus only to find out that the bus I needed only runs for two hours a day during rush hour. quite a pisser as the bus I did get on still meant that I had a 15 minute walk to campus after I got off. put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. guess, subway is the only way for me. yeah for unusable mass transit!

      oh, i forgot to mention. the Tibetan girl did call, repeatedly. but as I cannot remember exactly what she looked like and her english was even harder to understand over the phone i felt that meeting up might prove a tad difficult. plus, on the phone she told me that she spoke Japanese so now i'm really confused and am not even sure she was from tibet in the first place. my roommates seem to think she was quite cute but they were as drunk as i. better safe than sorry.

      Our refrigerator has been in a steady state of decline since Thursday. as it has been warming up we've been slowly throwing things out, again (had to empty it after the hurricane too). Stupid fridgerator, get off me! we are supposed to get a new one today so my roommate went out and got a little thing of milk last night since we figured it could last for one day. good news for Bobo, it means cappuchino for the first time since Thursday. Bobo has not been very cordial since Thursday. But soon, lattes, cappuchinos, and chai tea lattes will flow again, and all will be right in the world, and it was good. until then death to all that look at or speak to bobo!

Yet that’s all I can see When mine are closed And hers are burning mine  Like cherished nights full Of crows Or snow falling thick on  My grave  Closed eyes again, naked And trembling Alive and struggling Like ancient ambitions of religion  Over tonight’s storied past With so many troubled futures Of tomorrows ugly face And millions of laughing eyes

      I finally broke down and went bowling with the other grad students tonight. they go every wed. and I've been taking a lot of crap from the director of the painting and photo programs (two people you don't want on your bad side) for blowing it off. anyway, I haven't bowled in over 10 years and figured that I would suck really bad. man, let me tell you, its all relative and Bobo can bowl like a mo' fo'. scored a 121 and that was the third highest score. watching these people bowl was like looking at a car wreck. best six bucks i spent all week. next week bobo's going roller skating "backwards skate... now couples skate". just kidding about that you fuckwads.

      For Ginsberg   I’ve I’ve seen 9 thousand mutants grabbing for mind opening, body numbing elixirs; all for the quick fix.  Yet, what is it all for? Some quest, where holy Scripture presides over instant Heaven. Where; 10,000 bloodied suicide notes line the streets yet only one bloody opening exists.  Or resist dare I, or you, or we?  Go find Holiness in unanswered empty paged verse.  Go find God, 	the Lord, my Grace; in hot heated arguments of Law and Order.  After all, we; closed eyes and blank smile; dove into the abyss, elixir coated tongues and all - we ever knew -  fell like Heaven on this blank page.

      I am fucked..but unfortunately not literally fucked.  Was out with Bobo tonite..he is secretly quite proud of himself..but frankly the girl couldn't speak fucking english. Was pretty funny to watch though.  Gutted about going to bed alone...very very gutted...can't say I tried to go home with anyone..but the place we went to was hardly pick up material...unless you wanted a Tibetainise girl who couldn't speak english or a hiphop gangster out of south east.

      went to a bar tonight after another bar. the second one was quite dark. but, managed to meet a girl named Koi or Kai or something like that. she was from Tibet and my friend megan introduced us. she spoke almost no english and I speak no tibetainise so it worked out pretty well. one of her friends ended up asking me for my number for her because she was really shy, but I am not expecting either her or any of her friends to call me. however, I did get  urlLink PBR  on draft:)

      you want to know something that pisses me off? of course you do...the DC metro has some pretty long escalators. now you get on these things and hold onto the handrail only to find that the handrail and the escalator move at different speeds. WTF! though it is pretty funny to watch the dullards slowly stretch out as they ride up and down not consciously realizing what is really happening. oh those dullards.

Well thats what I want anyway...as I don't see that happening..think I will just buy a vibrator.

      Sounds like you guys picked the wrong city. Sex seems to be alive and well here in bal'mor hon! In the last two months, I overheard the following: 1. Getting out of car to go to brewers art, I believed I heard the distinct sounds of female extacy. Moving quickly from parked park to street, I found upon I was indeed correct. Loud female gasps were then punctuated with the percussion of ass slapping. Slap, "Oh Fuck Me", Slap, "Oh Fuck Me", etc. After several moments (minutes) of aural voyeurism, proceeded to Brewer's Art, got drunk! 2. One sunday morning returning home from brunch. Passing my neighbor Bob's house, I heard female gigling interupted by  Bob's voice, "Mommy want a spanking?" Slap! More extacy! Got drunk! 3. Finally, walking passed canton yuppie and drunk girlfriend. Heard girlfriend utter, "I want cock in my mouth!" Stupid yuppie could only seem to smoke his cigar and look cool. Maybe he wanted cock in his mouth. Me, I was already drunk!

      11/25/03  Last night I smoked A joint and listened to  Ayler.  My mind wandered From thoughts of freedom To you Your face, wrapped in gauze Like a mummy for The world to steal  Or Wait and see, the Forgotten texts that exist  On your breath; Sour as mashed grapes left In the sun for ages, bottled And drank by the paper mill  Workers on Oella.  You lie on your back, Hands folded like paper mâche. Mannequins or doves filled with Left over lemon meringue, either Way I left something behind, lent My thoughts to over a decade ago.  Then Stories once told by O’Hara  Kept me awake for hours, Now thoughts of you drown out my Existence in a neon stream of Marijuana smoke, and tear Drops.

      so i've been fooling around with this girl for a few weeks now who is a housemate of a friend of mine. She has a long distance boyfriend and they have an 'open' relationship. for me this means that I get to do all of the fun stuff without any of the commitment. anyway, we're playing around the other night and I ran into a little (ok a lot) of trouble trying to get her bra off. this thing was the  urlLink iron chastity belt  of bras. I've never experienced so much trouble with an undergarment. She actually says 'you've done this before, right?' (i'm hoping she was only kidding) Now, clearly i have, on many occasions, but this thing just wouldn't budge. i don't know, maybe its because i'm left-handed. at any rate she took it off for me and we got down to business. so my question is, why do these certain evil bras exist and what is to be done about them? i for one am now keeping a pair of scissors near the bed for emergency tittie extraction!!!

      It appears the looneys were out in force yesterday. Looney #1 was pissing on the Sylvan Learning center. "Hey mom I passed my test!" That in itself was not so weird. But he wasn't wearing shoes. This seems to be a new fashion trend amoung the indigent in B'more. I like it and might give it a try. How much is a pack of tube socks? Looney #2 was just standing in the middle of the street pulling up his pants in the cross walk. Kind'a of a run of the mill looney but I figured I should take the long way around.

      the dog has been barking incessantly for nearly 30 minutes now and the owner, who is home, apparently thinks its fucking hilarious because she has yet to SHUT THAT FUCKING DOG UP! Now if I am not mistaken the waiting period for a handgun in DC is something like 3 days. this means that with any luck, by Sunday the dog will have become yet another victim of handgun violence in the district. for shame.

      Bobo has slowly been turning vegitarian.

It made from people!!! today for breakfast Bobo made a sausage, egg, and cheese (with no egg) and used  urlLink Soylent Sausage . in the context of the breakfast sandwich it tastes fine and even has sausage like texture. plus, It made from people!!! even better, most of the veggie delights have 'brewers yeast' as one of the ingredients. why bobo not know but funny.

How many directors decide to tell a fictional story by actually filming the real thing. He actually moved the ship over the mountain to make the movie. most of the actors aren't even acting, they were real people doing the real thing. the whole movie is just a documentary of the film making process.

'that's odd' bobo thought but then came barreling down the stairs one big dog and two little ones. now we are three they say. very much like  urlLink cerebus . good thing bobo move out in two more weeks.

      ah, yes, the lure of the tattoo. lady green trusts that bobo will stay away from such nonsense as having a .44 Glock tattooed on his stomach, or for that matter, the word "sinner" in Gothic script across his back. And although they may be enticing, she also advises against Japanese/Chinese characters (they are a bit overdone these days, particularly by  urlLink celebrities ). But placement is just as important as image. The Flemish Lion is cool, but one wonders, where would bobo get it?  All this talk has lady green considering her next tattoo...:)

      bobo has a chance to get a great deal on a tattoo. so now to figure out what to get. bobo has had this man-machine  urlLink ghost in the shell  idea for awhile now. after doing some google searching bobo found out that this genre of tattooing is called  urlLink bio-mechanical . now after looking at this site bobo now think his idea very stupid. they all look way to graphic and illustrative and not as hard edged as bobo would like. perhaps that simply isn't possible with a tattoo. the only one that looked even sort of interesting is  urlLink this  one. so now bobo is thinking of nixing this idea and going for something a little more basic. black, solid shapes, no shading, no intricate designs. or maybe something like the  urlLink Flemish Lion  email or post thoughts...

      :A.poem-  12/21/03   She; Shut in her hermitage With crinkled mouth grins,  And , Coal black eyes, cold, Cold, for nights return,  Turns, Or rather makes, men  Into ghosts, into sprits that   Haunt, Like forests filled for Future deaths, graveyards even.  And  Her leaves turn like witches Mass, or a Sufi orgy of prayer.  Blank, Promises, glances, answers And hope all into those ghosts,  Like Morals.  Forever. Haunting The one they left alone.

      Bobo has been having a bad fucking week and you all are going to pay for it.  1) Bobo's camera equipment was stolen out of the photography lab at school. $3000 worth of Nikon gear walked off from a lab only accessible by students and faculty. any undergraduate found with said Nikon next semester will be beaten.  2) Amazon.com notified Bobo today that half the gifts he had ordered 'for x-mas delivery' are now suddenly on backorder. how things go from being 'usually ships in 24 hours' to 'fuck you later shitmonkey' is beyond me.  3) Bobo got a parking ticket today for having non-DC tags and being in DC. does that make any fucking sense@!$# "Citation for Determination of Proper License Registration" guess its the end you the year and DC needs some fucking revenue. my car was on a street that has no parking restrictions  4) I ordered new photo abulmns and they finally came this week but light impressions sent the wrong fucking slipcases. so i can't put them together in time for x-mas family bullshit ceremonies  5) the girl that i have a crush on and have finally started to hang out with left for australia yesterday and won't be back until the spring semester.  6) the other girl that I like quite a bit has been giving me the cold sholder.  7) other personal  tragedies ocurred which will not be discussed (even here), because I know that  she  is reading this.  8) i ran out of milk two days ago and that means i haven't had a fucking wake-up double latte in two days and that means i hate everything (more that usual).  9) my fucking cell phone is stuck in 'analog mode' and making calls is now extremely expensive. verizon customer service says "sorry we can't help you over the phone" AAARRRRGGGGGGHHH!!!  10) I've now run out of  urlLink apfelkorn

      ah, forgot to mention earlier. went to  urlLink Tysons corner  today (which is a mega mall in northern virginia). i took some medicine before I left to make sure I behaved myself. I hadn't even realized that it is only about 15 minutes from my new house. which actually doesn't matter since i'm unemployed and living off of student loans.  there is a reason that cyanide was invented and it should be pumped through that building post-haste. even tried to fight a guy at  urlLink panera bread  but he didn't bite. this middle-aged fuckhead bumps into my girl while we are waiting in line. she apologizes and this jerk off acts like it is her fault or something. so I spout out, 'Aren't you an asshole' i know the guy heard me but he just shuffled on out of the place. i wanted to kick is fuckin teeth in. AGGRO +20   though i did hear about some new guerilla political terrorism in which this group is putting 'will kill for gas' bumper stickers on SUV's in parking garages. now that makes bobo happy in his special place.

      funny fucking thing of the day: go into my lab to finish some printing. go to leave lab and the door handle won't turn. its unlocked, in fact its the designed so that you can't lock yourself in but that is exactly what happened. so I jiggle it for a few minutes and only succeed in removing the handle from the door (probably part of the reason why i couldn't get out in the first place). at this point i'm getting a little anxious. steel fire door with four cement walls and a sink. the whole thing is like 6' x 6' and i'm quickly running out of coffee. so i'm thinking, shit, should I actually start yelling for help or something? My only hope was that I thought my boss was still in his office. now even though my cell phone doesn't work in the lab I have a phone that I can make inter-campus calls on. so i call him and fortunately he answers and comes to my rescue. With all the recent things fucking up my life this one certainly is the icing on the cake. the worst thing is that I told a few people and they didn't seem to believe me!

      turns out bobo has an underground fan base that has been keeping quiet. he has been discreetly approached by those who are on the side of that which is good and righteous, uh no wait, that's not my side. any who they support the Bobo and our wonderful blog. As a great friend once said, "Let the ruling classes tremble at the fat-tard revolution. The Bobo's have nothing to lose but their pants. They have a world to win." How true my friend, how true.  finally got my new camera ordered today to replace the one that was stolen. have not received anything from my insurance but can't wait any longer. just put the whole thing all $4550 and change on the old credit card. be here soon camera.  Also ordered a $20  urlLink Holga  as a backup.

      yes,  lady green  the shit certainly has hit the perverbial fan. so for all of you new readers out there and for you old ones who don't have all of the pieces I give you the ontology of Bobo and Bobo Smash Blog!  Bobo was a guy that  Bobo ,  Winston , and  complete_and_utter_moron  used to work with. this particular Bobo was a real jackass. now, when he would do stupid shit the three of us would pick up tools, dance around the workshop, smash things, and chant 'Bobo smash, bobo smash, bobo smash.' as you can imagine this infuriated bobo to no end.  so, this bobo is based on that bobo, follow? right then, as far as how this bobo came to be this bobo, as opposed to the other bobo, here are a list of sites that bobo has been influenced by (somewhat in order). and believe me, if you're offended by my site you sure as hell won't like any of these:) And for the most part Bobo likes the affiliates of these sites as well.   urlLink Portal of Evil ,  urlLink Fat Chicks in Party Hats  (be sure to read the hate mail),  urlLink Peter Pan Fashion Pages , urlLink Ninja Burger ,  urlLink FARK ,  urlLink The Onion ,  urlLink Something Awful ,  urlLink Wil Wheaton Blog (yeah, wesley crushser from Star Trek TNG) ,  urlLink Things I hate , and the now defunct  Tard Blog  (sorry no link but it used to be blog written by special ed teachers about their retarded students).  that's just a sampling of what old Bobo has found on the internet and believe me you should see the shit even I won't put a link too.

      lady green felt compelled to comment on bobo's post from last Friday. Indeed it can very important who reads the ole blog. Case in point for this girl: guitar boy. She's convinced that's the reason he broke up with her. Perhaps he was afraid that he would read about our sex life (as it were) on the internet. Who knows, maybe he's reading this right now. Too late! And once the blog gets read there is no going back (remember, it is a diary of sorts and diaries are bound to be read by the wrong people). If those girls don't appreciate humor and a little bit of the absurd, than what good are they? (well, you're right, they are probably good for a  couple  of things...).   :)

      have had such a terrible fucking week (no internet means that I didn't post most of what happened but take my word for it) that i thought i would treat myself tonight to a three year old bottle of peche. so good. if my week hadn't been bad enough i went to get a new battery for my car today (it broke down last weekend) and on my way home from the battery place the power steering pump exploded. fluid all over everything and car no steer now. managed to get it back in front of the house and i think it will sit there until the spring thaw.

      have you ever heard the old adage 'don't shit where you eat'? well, bobo has but didn't pay very much attention to it. you see bobo gave out the address of his main site to a few of the 'girls' at school. they actually took the time to look at the site and tell all of the other girls, and of course they found the blog. no big deal, right? afterall, all of my friends like Bobo, my old college friends too, my ex, the late shift crew at Checker's in SE, and all of you other randoms out there in the WWW. Hundreds of you now tune in every day to see what is happening in the exciting and ever-changing world of Bobo and Friends. so, i thought they would find it as equally pleasing as the rest of you. well, they pretty much ignored me all week and I couldn't figure out why. turns out not only did they hate it, but they were all actually quite offended by it. they now think that bobo is an ass (which, in my own defense is only partially correct) and won't talk to him. and given the nature of some recent posts it has made things a tad awkward between bobo and one girl in particular (who bobo has come to realize is not interested, at all). it also appears they took the personals ad way too seriously. alas loyal fans, what can be done to fix this situation? Bobo has a feeling that it is going to be a long semester...as Christian Slater would say, 'So be it'!

"jam me, jack me, push me, pull me, talk hard" bobo love samantha mathis, though i think this was her first and only big movie. new house kicks ass, it came with a 12 pack of leffe and some pizza. also got to have a sparks, which was quite refreshing after a long day of moving. it is snowing now but the only thing bobo has to do in the am is make and subsequently eat, pancakes. new photos of the house to follow soon.

      what's the best way to start the morning off right? warm up the espresso machine, start to pull a shot, and BLAM!, the portafilter literally separated from the machine spraying the kitchen and my face with very, very hot coffee. "I'm very badly burned" a shocked Bobo was quoted as saying. perhaps suing McDonalds would be the best course of action. so with the machine out of commission (for what appears permanently), Bobo soaked up the coffee mess with a sponge and squeezed it into his mug with some steamed milk. Ahhhh.....espresso mit wall fungus....now its off to CVS for burn cream.

I flirt with everybody...in fact I have probably even flirted with Bobo....scary thought.   Felt jet lagged as hell today...work was hell...oh well. Could be almost time for bed.  Alone.

Lifeless lines of verse flow like the stanzas of a soldiers life, in a foxhole; 	on the eve of his desertion. All familiar 	yet too far gone to be exact.  How much will does it take to forget sorrows  and  forget loneliness for the minute, unabashedly 	squalid detail that it is? Will bourbon do; make it a double?  I still know not of what it takes to be great 	(or at least elusive, for chris-sakes.) But patterns of me are written, just for , perhaps, you.

      Bobo found out tonight that there are a lot of hot single girls in DC as evidenced by the personals ad thing. but, perhaps responding to perpective dates while boozed up is not the best of ideas. though, many have said that bobo more fun drunk than sober, guess we will find out. NO FATTIES!   now playing:   urlLink Interpol

      Well the  urlLink Bobo Personals Ad  is back and more indigent, oh wait, i think i mean indignant...yes, i mean indignant than ever. so what is the best way to write such an outstanding personal ad guaranteed to garner the attention of all the ladies? well, first you slip on the fucking icy street today and fuck up your back. then, you spend all day in front of the computer working on your  urlLink website  since you can now barely move. and, finally to dull the pain you drink copious quantities of alcohol and get SASSY.

'Drink me' Apfelkorn say. 'Ok' bobo say. 'mmmmm....appely' bobo say. 'you stupid bobo' apfelkorn say.

      1/6/04 or  I am America   As apple pie as: "1984" or Salinger when 13 and Dieing to escape the cold grip Of the suburbs.  Or was that the warm  Embrace? Sometimes forgotten over Long trips to the supermarket  And vacations from the beat to Banana Republic.  I know now That I am America. I am the great fear  Of all rebellion and the Icy breath of wrinkled grandparents  Named "pop-pop" with wrinkled  Eyes and lost hair, murmuring  "Spend wisely," as they hand you  Their last buck.  I am America. Skateboards and graffiti markers Were once my textbooks and art,  Now all I have is Derrida and Sol LeWitt. I am America, and at 12 was an Anarchist, And am sorry (I should have been a  Socialist after all….there really ought to  Be some structure) I am America.  As My millions go on, dead, dying, Rich, killing, soiled, forgotten, I am America because all I do is  Complain.

I just rolled on by in the ole' Honda Accord and decided I would have better luck elsewhere. The rotweiler definitely had the upper hand when I passed.

      4-21-04 or       cantaloupe       Like those that try and conceptualize the idea   of life  not  the meaning like some reading books on language and related biblical texts referring to  the vast public infrastructure that led to the ultimate demise of…you  We all pitter and quail under the fluorescent lights of mothers asking “what can we do to help? how can it all go away and still not be gone” Screaming back in tongues of the biblical: “Leave me alone, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone…” repeated ad-infinite until the words begin to bend and  mold, mildewed resin becomes decoration  for the ages.  Lessons learned. Diseases  complicated; unknown utterances finally  solved…the puzzle is somehow related to   Adam, and the garden with god’s own tarnished voice harrowing over our lives like plague.

The site now gets a shitload of traffic but I don't see these comments? Does stupid Bobo intimidate stupider readers? must be so...

      as if i don't take enough shit from the 'girls' at school I get it at home now too. today was the first night that i've been home from the lab before 9pm in almost two weeks and the first thing i get from the two girls i live with is "hey communist china." This apparently is my new nickname since i'm never around. yeah, makes plenty of sense. so i actually hang out with them for a bit and not 30 minutes later both of them are in their respective rooms, chatting away on their cellphones with their boyfriends. Well folks,  communist china  watched RAMBO with the  ginmonster  and is now going to bed.

      Just now got home from a long day at the lab doing film tests and such. went out with a few of the 'girls' after the lab closed. special thanks to 'J' and his  urlLink zip car . Dude, you are a trooper!!! the 'girls' would be in serious trouble without you.  found a bar that had cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon on special, which was nice since I was wearing the t-shirt. yeah, that makes you feel like a tool. The 'girls' enjoyed some tequila, but I have learned from past experiences that tequila, in no way, shape, or form is ever a good idea. The ride home was a bit dicey and I ended up walking the last 1/2 mile or so to allow 'J' to get to the downtown with his passengers (who kept wanting to exit the vehicle at any opportunity).

      Well...one of my New Years resolutions was to take up dancing again.....as I never ever stick to such resolutions (i.e. I have been a smoker for 6 years and my NY resolution for the last six years has been to give up smoking....)...I decided this is one I would stick to.   BIG MISTAKE.   Last night..me and one of my roomates decided to do a beginners ballet class.  Now....its been 11 years since I did ballet .....but that class last night...... beginners' ballet my ass....OH MY GOD it was hard.   I am NEVER GOING BACK.     Still no second date in sight with metro man.....hmmmm....its been a week.  Must be a bad sign.

      There have been few times in his life where Bobo has believed in the existence of god. Today was one of those days. Last night the  GinMonster  went out and got shit-housed, so much so that he stayed home from work. So by pure chance he was home today when UPS came to deliver my  urlLink camera , which turned out to truly be an act of divine intervention since UPS wouldn't deliver it without a signature (they left a note to that affect yesterday). So Bobo is very happy now and will remain so until the credit card bill comes in a few weeks. Now to do some ISO and Zone VIII tests!!!

      allright fuckwads. I'm not feeling well but I can't sleep either. so in response to popular demand I have instituted  COMMENTS . I've even made them retroactive. now, I don't particularly like how they show up in a pop-up window but its a free service. If people actually use them I might shell out the $50 to set up PHP scripting on the server and get some real comment action going. totally up to you out there in the WWW. so post away my little friends.

      When is it too soon to sleep with him? well, three dates or $150 is the standard womanizing answer. however, since you are new to this american dating thing I'll be more honest. I would give it three weeks or a month if you really like him or sleep with him on the second date if you don't.  But, that's just my opinion and I'm the one who can't find a girl that likes him in a city where its three girls for every one guy. I'm also about the pickiest  sonofabitch  you'll ever meet so that certainly doesn't help.

      For those of you who think your favorite moron is a loser, think again. I was in safeway shopping for toilet paper and Preperation H, when they announced their daily cake give away. Seems they give away a cake to whoever is standing on the blue number placed in each isle when that number is announced. I hear the voice call out "13". After some quick calculations, I realize, I am in fact in isle 14 and 13 is right around the corner. I have never moved so fast. Unfortunately no one was standing on that number (I am always looking for a scrap!) and I was able to dive for it just as the employee looked up. "We have a winner!" Victory never tasted so sweet! Let them eat cake. They don't have any cake? Well I do, so "fuck off"

The whole skeleton is worth $4000. so for those of you who think that your life is worthless, fear not. when its over your bones alone cost a few grand. even more with a full set of teeth. and just think what those kidneys are going for! organ and bone harvesting seems to be a profitable business. did I mention most of the human bones come from China?

      Had my first mid-term today in almost four years. Had me quite stressed but ended up being ok. It is certainly odd to have to take tests again. started riding my new  urlLink bike  to school this week. takes 20 minutes each way by bike but 45-60 minutes by metro. Plus the bike ride is free and gives me exercise. and, nothing wakes you up in the morning like being hit in the shoulder by some asshat's minivan's mirror. but such is life when riding in heavy city traffic. i even wore my helmet. (now see here is where I would want to link to a picture of a retard wearing a helmet so what I did was google 'helmets for retards' but only found links to a  urlLink kid's  weblog who has some serious issues with the ole' penis and  urlLink poopreport.com  which does not require a synopsis.  ok it took awhile but I found  urlLink it . and yes, it appears that I am now going to hell (yeah, like i wasn't before or something).

      The last two days have been beautiful and warm, and you know what that means on a college campus. That's right kids, long legs and short skirts. did I mention how good it is to be a grad. student? now a word here about short skirts, long legs, and boots. It seems that big boots have taken campus by storm. First it was the  urlLink UGG  boots which truly live up to their namesake. now this spring it is the  urlLink Moon Boots . girls, a small word of advice from the ever fashion concious Bobo. Big Boots are not attractive! Short skirts, YES. revealing top, YES. big Boots, NO. that is all.

I have this normal coffee maker in my lab but it is a real pain in the ass to make a single cup of coffee with it. even at best i have to brew half a pot and end up dumping most of it out. I was at Target, pronounced TAR-jay, on saturday and they had these cool single serve coffee makers that use these  urlLink PODS . seems pretty cool and the cost of the pods is way cheaper then startbucks but does it make decent coffee. send your comments now!

      Seeing  urlLink Neubauten  last night at urlLink  9:30  was pretty incredible. it was like a  urlLink suicide girls  convention. highlight was a bald girl in corset with a back tattoo. nice:) of course the group said that they would never again play in america after this tour. "it is too expensive to travel to the US and the crowds are getting smaller." it seems the goth scene has only worsened since it began. tons of 'blacked out posers' screaming random german words. Neubauten's response, "we played that song in 1980, you're a little late now." great music, great performance, stupid DC trash. this ain't your momma's industrial music.

      our fancy, 300 channel cable provided only a single movie that I had not seen but had actually heard of:  urlLink From Dusk till Dawn . Are you fucking kidding me? the first half had nothing to do with the second and it only got worse from the beginning. Is this why we pay starpower $94 per month. fucking shite. at least we get HBO 'after dark' soft porn specials 'on demand' for free.  urlLink Hookers and Taxi Cab confessions  are certainly household favs.

      ahhh, what an evening... urlLink WRC  New Zealand and hombrew Belgain Dubbel. Its been pretty quiet this week. semester winding down, no sign of summer employment in sight. my main goal for the summer is to become an alcoholic and qualify for some type of public assistance. section 8 housing, foodstamps, free crack rock, i don't care, I just want something back from those years of paying taxes into a system that offers nothing in return.   oh, on the upswing (not sure if that's even a saying or not) I received my 8mm movie filmstock today and will begin career as cinematographer tomorrow. i have 50ft of super 8mm film which should last for about 3 minutes. Excitement and wonder abound.   and just like the daily show i will leave you with a moment of 'jet pack'  urlLink ZEN . Smell ya'll nerds later.

      Went and saw  urlLink The Sounds  tonight at  urlLink 9:30  club. Bobo out late on a Monday? well it beats work. So, they're swedish...already off to a bad start. The only good things to come out of sweden are: swedish fish, WRC sweden, IKEA, ok so there are a few things after all. oh and meatballs, can't forget swedish meatballs with the special swedish meatball sauce. The Sounds are four skinny white guys with mullets fronted by a Daryl Hannah from BladeRunner look alike blonde who took Cindy Lauper, Blondie, and madonna mannerisms combined with vintage dress, cigarette, and stockings and you end up with 'played out.' I know that's kind of mean, but hey this crew could have all just walked out of  urlLink Urban Outfitters . The music was great, 80's synth riffs, nice drums, candy coated melodies,  I Love the 80's , but they really need to stop trying so hard. But maybe that's what you do in sweden.

      riding this fixed gear bike is going to blow out my knees. I've ridden it to school every day for the past 6 weeks, light or dark, rain or shine. its a nice easy downhill in the morning so I'm spinning like crazy for 4.5 miles. then a wicked climb no matter which way I try to come home combined with locking the wheel up on occasion to avoid the random pedestrian. today i tried a new way home but the climb was so steep in parts that I nearly had to get off and walk. now my knees are killing me, but at least i'm getting some quality exercise. riding almost an hour a day which is more then i have been doing in the past year.

      haven't had much to post about recently. just been doing a lot of work. have started a new installation project that will have video, sound, and smells. That's right,  urlLink smell . now the link goes to the main catalog but I am using their novelty odors including: methane, tar, and coal gas. I've also asked them about making a 'burning tire' smell which they were quite excited about. I'll keep you posted.   was up in New York all day yesterday. saw some great art in chelsea but was sorely disappointed by the  urlLink whitney biennial . absolute waste of $9.50. also, it took 7 hours to get back home on the bus due to some Ass-hat who wrecked and shut down 95 south. Eating dinner at a shit as Roy Rogers in a rest stop at midnight with a severe motion sickness induced migraine is not how you make bobo happy. next time, i'm driving myself and spending the night.   smell you later...get a job - Brak

      Well kiwigirl has not posted in a long time - so figured it was about time to enlighten you all with my dating stories......  Hmmm well I finally slept with my first American boy (i think i mentioned this previously).  Well I got rid of him (he was FAR too American)...started dating another American boy (but this one has lived in Europe for a number of years - alot more promising right???).  We went on our first date, i got really really drunk and started making out with him in one of my favourite bars in Dupont - NOT a good idea.  Anyway in my extreme drunkness (like 8 vodkas) i decided to take him home - so I took him home.  Did not shag - but woke up thinking life was good.  Second date - what a disaster - I didn't find him funny, cute or interesting - what was I thinking?  Why did i take him home the first night?  My late New Years resolution is never never to get drunk on a first date.  And thats my story....  I think I need a nice kiwi boy - or perhaps even an Aussie boy....actually I think I just need to move to South Africa to be with my ex who I clearly still love.  :)   PS - what kind of country does not give you time off over Easter off?  I mean...seriously...how rude.....

      Well, to the complete disappointment of all you women out there, your favorite moron got hitched. I know it will be difficult for you all to be denied my wit, charm, class and good looks. Not to mention the smell of my ass(well on second thought that is still available to all.) Went to Berlin for my honeymoon, nothing like a little romance on a warm beach, pina coladas, sand. I picked the wrong fucking place, nowhere in the tourist brochure did they mention highs in the 30's and snow. Those bermuda shorts and Hawaiian shirts don't provide much warmth.  Berlin is my kind of city. Trash, bombed out buildings(still) riddled with bullet holes, mullets and lots of crazies. Makes B,more look like the suburbs. The full report with pictures will follow soon.

      went and saw Jon Aquaviva spin at  urlLink Five  last night. talk about a waste of $10. absolutely terrible. old music, bad music. the dj before hime was spinning will smith, and selected 80's tunes, "are you down with OPP?", no, I'm not, now shut the hell up.

      The cicada situation has reached, unbearable. there are nearly 20 per square foot in the backyard. tonight's BBQ has been canceled. If there was ever a time to duct tape your windows and cower in your closet this is it. and the fucking noise, just on and on and on. hopefully this is the climax to their life cycle.

I just got the flash last week and the bracket this afternoon so today was the first time i got it all together. I was plugging it all up tonight and POP the flash goes off right in my eyes. This thing is wicked strong and i was literally blind for about 30 seconds. Its been an hour and i still can't see quite right plus my eyes actually ache. i think i might have caused some permanent damage.

      for those of you that have been paying attention Bobosmash is fast approaching its one year aniversary. my entire life for the past year can be summed up by a single URL. what's fucked up is that this blog is like an online diary, yet just like a real one no one apparently looks at it. post some fucking comments your tards. I check the server stats, this site gets almost 100 unique hits per week. idiots.

      initial testing with the vintage Mr. Coffee has not gone well. safety was not a key issue for the designers of the 1970's machine and it gets extremely hot, in places that it should not. first pot of coffee resulted in a severely burned thumb. however, it makes nice hot coffee. the same cannot be said for the lukewarm shit that is passed of as coffee by $tarfucks and Au Bon Pain. today's coffee was a bit weak, but maybe the machine was simply calibrated for the stronger blends of coffee that were available in the 70's. conspiracy theory, i think so. everything was bigger and badder in the 70's. big bell bottoms, big hair, big muscle cars, and strong ass coffee. tomorrow I'll brew the beans double strength in my effort to reclaim Mr. Coffee Manifest Destiny. stay tuned for the continuation of this exciting saga.

      scored a  urlLink vintage MR. Coffee  machine today. seems to work fine and makes tasty vintage faux-wood-panel flavored coffee. even endorsed by Joe DiMaggio, what more could you ask for? and did you notice the original packaging? EBay rocks!  spent friday night at the  urlLink Black Cat  in DC. "GIRL FRIDAY presents Bhangra and Hip-Hop with special guest DJ REKHA." Bhangra is like techno with Indian Punjabi riffs and some funky lyrics that i don't understand. fun to dance to though. talk about an odd crowd, girl friday has it's fair share of lesbians and then DJ Rekha attracts a large indian group. Tranny Boy meets Sikh, FFL.

      had a bottle thrown at me while riding home from work today. Fortunately, DC traffic is quite heavy and i was able to catch the guy and administer a swift kick to his car door. a cop saw me do it and didn't bat an eye, guess he figured the guy must have had it coming.  then trie to see Fahrenheit 9/11. bought tickets, went into the theatre, and...the fire alarms go off. most people were just standing around like it was no big deal. I on the other hand watch the news and am a bit more wary about these type of things. out the door i went, i'll go back for a refund tomorrow!

I was quite excited about their new exhibition on August Sander and Aaron Siskind and was able to go to the member's preview tonight. it was very well curated and well worth seeing.  now, in other, more incredible news, i stumbled across a bar that has Leffe, Blonde and Brown, on draft!!!  urlLink Bistrot du Coin .

      off-roading in the Honda was not a good idea. the car broke down, power steering hose burst earlier in the week. managed to get that fixed and some other things repaired as well but there is still quite a rattle from something underneath of the car. I have a feeling that the catalytic converter is trying to separate itself.

I realized it the next day and went back to look for it. I found it three shelves over with a few pages torn out and my schedule missing. what kind of fuck would do that?

Swimming is fun
