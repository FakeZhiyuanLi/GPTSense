       "You gotta let your guard down."    "There's something about you... that i just want."       It's amazing how guys can make you feel so good, and then again soo bad.  I think about what I've gone through w/ guys, the abusement, the hurt feelings EVERYTHING!!!   It's really hard to see the good in any guy after so much shit happens.  And that's when things go wrong.  I went to the club tonight w/ carm, ry, and marissa.  I also met 2 awesome guys.  I dissed the one, I feel really bad, and i didnt mean to i was just kidding.  But he took it serious and left.  I ended up chasing him to the parking lot and we talked then i called him and we talked some more.  And he's really awesome.  I feel bad because I have my guard up 24/7. It's sooo hard for me to trust guys, then when i find decent ones I act like a moron and diss them. Whats a girl to do.  It's hard.  So i met Nate.  He was cool, i dissed him and i dunno why.  I acted like I was drunk.  I guess i was just frontin so if he dissed me i wouldnt feel stupid.  Those quotes up there ^ thats what he said to me.  I also met Paul.  Joe's friend.  He's cool, I havent talked to him as much.  He wants to chill tom. i dunno if that gonna work because He wants me to meet him in green tree and i forsure cant drive.  lol.  So i dunno... They're both really cute, and they both drive, which is fucking AWESOME.  But i dunno what i should do.      So anywayz we go to club zoo, and we meet marissa and joe and paul there.  It was ass... we sat in the parking lot for like 2 hours.  Then Nate and his crew came and we talked and finally decided we would make our own party up in there.  So we figure there will be at least 30-40 people there.  NO... there was 4 ppl in there.  4 FUCKING PEOPLE.  So we go in a stand around for a while.  so then me carm and marissa start dancing and the whole Nate thing happens.  Then we went out side and messed around w/ everyone.  I was talking to Nate and Paul off and on.. Then carm, ry, marissa, and me went to funfest... left 2 mins later, and went to eat n park.  That was fun the food was gross.  So then some lame asses start harassing marissa so we fuck w/ them for 45 mins.  So the night was just great... But Nate called me and we talked for a while... he's really sweet.  But he lives sooo far away!! omg... so does paul.. They both live like 30-45 mins away... It sux ass... grrr.. go figure... so me and carm... have decided not to drink tonight.. this will be our first sober night together!!! it's kinda lame... lol ok well we're out.. i'm dying here!! NIGHT

      "&nbsp;  I'm just not the girl for you... You need&nbsp;a girl who's happy&nbsp;and perky all the time.&nbsp; Maybe a girl who's had&nbsp;part of her brain removed, and she thinks she's a&nbsp;bunny.&nbsp; Then you could go off and be bunnies together.  &nbsp;"  Wow it's amazing how ignorant a person can be.&nbsp; I mean you give all you got and yet they still dont appreciate it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes I'm talking about him again.&nbsp; I hate him... I tried to be cool, but a person can only listen to these things for so long before they kill someone.&nbsp; Ya well carm and ry came over my house on Monday.&nbsp; My mom wouldnt let me go out so we just chilled outside.&nbsp; So for some reason, i think it's better if I hear what the dickwad says about me for myself.&nbsp; It's not that i dont believe carm, I do, I kno she wouldnt lie to me.&nbsp; I just have to hear it for myself to let it sink in.&nbsp; So we 3-way him, and i mute my phone so he cant hear me.&nbsp; wow was not ready for that one.&nbsp; No one has ever said such bad things about me.&nbsp; It really hurt.&nbsp; Some one who you gave your self up to is now calling you a psycho bitch.&nbsp; It hits ya hard.&nbsp; So I'm listening.&nbsp; And i realize I'm a fucking moron.&nbsp; Yup i said it.&nbsp; Everyone was right... I'm stupid.&nbsp; I mean i think the reason this happened is because we were jagged about it.&nbsp; Oh becca you want him.&nbsp; Oh dickwad you want her.&nbsp; You guys should JUST bone.&nbsp; I love the just in that.&nbsp; Like its giving someone a high five or something.&nbsp; JUST do it.&nbsp; Ya fuck off nike... no one wants to just do anything!&nbsp; So after ppl nag for so long it'll happened.&nbsp; But thats not what hurts. It hurts that he doesnt care at all...&nbsp; carm was talking to him and was like well why did u do it but not talk to her afterward.&nbsp; and he said... well she has a nice body, and you wanna talk to her but when you go talk to her your just like shut up!...&nbsp; I'm an annoying lil 5 year old, followed by a psycho bitch... OH and the best part... I'm conceited... YUP me... conceited... I'm soo hott, everyone wants me... blahbalhabh... .you kno what.... suck my right one.&nbsp; I'm not conceited... I'm NOT insecure w/ my body... I'm not in love w/ you.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll let you kno that im not waiting for you, that i could be w/ someone else, I'm insecure w/ you and what you'll say about my body, and I dont have feeling for you.&nbsp; It hurts to see him care sooo much about my best friend,&nbsp; and not care if i dropped off the face of the earth.&nbsp; but whatev.&nbsp; I've learned what guys want, what they see, what they need.&nbsp; and i hope they are deprived of all of it.&nbsp; But not all guys are bad.&nbsp; There are a select few who i like, and trust.&nbsp;&nbsp; An that night i ended up calling an ex. just to see if they're all the same... I realized soon that this was one of the guys i liked.&nbsp;&nbsp; One that i could trust, and no matter how much of an asshole he acts, that i could go to him w/ a problem.&nbsp; This was the only thing that got me out of my mood that night.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then last night&nbsp;matt calls me&nbsp;to go for icecream and im like surre not like i have&nbsp;anything else in my life.&nbsp; So we leave and pj calls... so we stop up pj's.&nbsp; and they're doing cars... boys and their cars i&nbsp;dont understand it.&nbsp; Anywayz... we get carm and we get icecream and i call my mom to&nbsp;let her kno i may not be home on time... and she starts&nbsp;flipping out on me!... so i get home... SIX (6) FUCKING MINUTES LATE.... 6 minutes... and she grounds me.... wtf.&nbsp; She acts like im so trouble kid who does drug and&nbsp;has six kids..... she is so highed up off a power trip its unreal.... she thinks just&nbsp;because&nbsp;she has slight rule over me that she&nbsp;can take over my life....arrggg... she&nbsp;wouldnt even let me explain...&nbsp; she makes me soo mad... i dunno how long im grounded or anything... I'm suppose to go to the club tonight w/ carm,&nbsp;ry and joe... if she doesnt let me go then,,, i'll just kill myself....&nbsp;ITS ALL MATT'S FAULT...&nbsp;BOYS AND CARS.... BOYS ARE BAD, BOYS=DEATH...&nbsp;yup my conclusion on life!&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok .... AHHHHEHHHHH  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so then this morning i wake up cuz i gotta go to work.&nbsp; and usual my dad rides me and we were just talking about this the other morning....&nbsp; i get up and go in his room and hes sleeping, its like 9 and he's sleeping and no one tells me this.&nbsp; So i had to take a bus to work, i had no idea waht time it was coming or anything, so im rushing around like a mental person and the dog if barking at fake food, and ahhh it was a mess... but i get to work and it got a lil better... the ppl i work w/ are real cool, and we just goof off all day.&nbsp;&nbsp; PLUS IT WAS PAYDAY!!! YAYAY!&nbsp; 200some... i was syked!... im going shopping.&nbsp; but thats enough ranting for the day... PEACE.

He just wouldnt have it.&nbsp; I understand i kinda spazzed out, but sorry oops i was drunk again... things come out.&nbsp; But I've given up... I dont care.&nbsp; I'm better off w/out u... as a friend.&nbsp; And thats all I ever wanted from him... Just to be cool, as friends.&nbsp; Not to hook up and be used.&nbsp; Thats what he wanted.&nbsp;   I'm tired of apalogizing for his mistakes....   FUCK HIM.&nbsp; i dont care about him... have a nice life... and if your still gonna talk shit about me... at least grow some balls and say it to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People are just stupid.&nbsp; You should kno if your gonna talk shit about me to my best friend, I'm gonna find out... Your not worth the secret...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; Now that that's said and done. I think I'm ok... I'm gonna go... I'm starving...

       "*she said i had a small penis and made fun of me for it....that's sexual harrassment! fire her* "  Laura Popinski    I've come to the conclusion that work sucks more than boys!! Yeah... ITS FUCKING GREAT.... I've been working wayyyy to much.  I just wanna kill myself.  I'm scheduled for 4 hrs and endup staying 6.  I'm just way too helpful.  I 'm just gonna not do anything and hopefully get sent home early.  The money isnt even worth it, because I'm too tired to spend it.  OH well... Soccer starts tom.  fun fun fun.   10-12 in the morning 6-8 in the evening and work in between.  YES YES YES!!!   Laura works at panera now... thats fun...    Grrrr.  So i was making sandwiches on line today and I cut my finger.  Owww.  Ya it was bleeding and everything.  Then matt put a bandaid on it and made me wear a finger condom.  yes a finger condom have you ever heard of such a thing.  Well i guess u smaller guys have but still...  I get into these rages where I just get really mad at whoever is by me.  You dont ever have to kno me and I'll get really pissed at you.  Its kinda bad cuz then i just flip out.  oh well.   Talk to Nate, told him I met the man of my dreams,  just to tick him off.  He got all offensive.  Like ok well just call me now and then and tell me about the man of your dreams.  haha its funny.  Maybe he'll finally realize that he's no where near perfer, or being the man of any ones dreams.  HaHa sucks for him.   so last night I went to a fair w/ carm, erin, marisha, and mar.  That was great.  First paul calls me and tells me hes going and I'm like oh great, we can meet up, so we're talking and we're like Im at the front but i dont see you.  So after about 20 mins of this he's like... OH we're at different fairs.  Nice job.  i was like oh wow.. thats just great.  so there was this fish game and u had to a ball in the bowl and u won a fish.  so we all tried and spent like $15 as a group on winning a fish.  Finally I got a ball in the bowl and won a fish... it was hysterical.. we starting jumping and yelling when we won.  We named him Nemo.  Sadly nemo died this morning... he was only yeh big.. Oh well I'll get a new one.. lol.. Ok well Im out.. Im really tired.. ill write whenever I get a chance to breathe again! lol

       " This pop makes you skinny " the retarded guy at walmart.   It's been a few days since I wrote. Let me tell you... lots have happened. I'm not talking to fucking Nate anymore. Man of my dreams my ass. That is the biggest asshole I've almost ever met. I called him one night and he was at 'his party' and I was like 'OH thanks for inviting me'. and I was joking and he got all serious and was like, well how r u gonna get out here. Is your mom gonna drive you out here and pick you up... did u expect me to pick u up. Then I just hung up cuz i wasnt gonna be made fun and sit there and take it. So his friend calls me back and is like we have plenty of beer if your mom's gonna drive you out u can come. Like no asshole I was just kidding.... and after about 15 mins. of argueing i just said fuck it... then i brought up the fact that he called me a psycho bitch and told carm all i did was complain. when i asked about this he got all frustrated. and he was like babe i was just kidding I wouldnt call u if i thought u were a psycho bitch. So we argued and I was like oh whatever im going, and he was like tonight is not a good night to talk.. I'll just call you tom. .. Guess what... he never fucking called... fucking pussy!!! Ya so now I'm calling him... WOW..... Carms talking this could be potentianlly bad... ( I'm a lil tipsy so im having a hard time spelling)... this is going great... anyway!!!  Ya so now that I'm done talking to him, I guess we're straight.  i dunno whatever.  I went on a 'date' w/ paul wed. It was good i guess. We went to a movie and saw harold and kumar go to white castle.   it was funny.  He's a nice guy... and cute... i dunno were this is going but it could go somewhere.... ok i forgot what I was typing ill just ttyl... peace!

       " I'm so depressed I could eat a whole cow "  ~ Rosie O'Donnell 'A league of their own'     Hahah I love it! lol, i was watchin that movie the other day, and she said that and i started to die... lmao... Ya today is just blah... It's been a bad effing week.  I had off yesterday, so i wanted to go to sandcastle w/ M-Dizzle.  Well Nate was suppose to go too, so that just made me extra excited.  So we get their, and set our stuff down.. 5 mins later it starts to pour!!! We didnt even get to take our clothes off... I was so pissed, I spent $10 bucks to sent my bag on a chair and get rained on, thanks alot.  So we went to see a movie, and we saw 'The village', it as extremely lame.  It was good watching it, but afterwards it was like that was a bad movie.  The theme or plot was bad, I was very upset.  So then my parents pick us up aftewards, and I tell my dad what happened w/ sandcastle and he starts flipping out on me.  Why didnt you go till 3, its your fault, blah blah blah.  whatever.  I was like DAD!! ITS NOT MY FAULT IT FUCKING RAINED.  and it's not my fault we didnt get there till 3.  It's not like your lazy ass would drive me or anything.  And he keeps on going, oh well its your fault.  whatever fuck you!  anywayz he paid for it, he gave me a 20, i was gonna give it back but i said fuck it, u just lost 10 bucks not me.  So then last night Nate calls me, and says he's gonna take a shower and call me back.. and he was like dont go to sleep.. so i was like ok... ya well he never called back i was just a lil upset...       Today i had to work at 10.  Usually my dad drives me cuz he's up and whatever else not.  No not now.. He found a bus pass so now I have to get up an hour early and catch a bus while his fat ass sits at the table and eats.  AHHH he makes me so mad.. Works sucked as usual.  I sprayed myself w/ the hose so i was all wet and it just gets worse.  But i did make a $3 tip... then it starts to pour when i get off..  fuck it I'm not catching a bus in the rain so i call my pap.  And i tell my dad this, and he starts again that it's my fault shit.  Why did u call pap, blah blah... It's my fault that it fucking rained great!!! He said something else, and I was just like shut up, I dont want to hear it, It's not my fault i dont control the fucking universe.  Notice the more upset I get the more i use fuck... Yay!!!         Yup thats my life... hows yours.  I mean it's not bad, I just get aggrivated w/ it sometimes... Cant wait till I'm 18, I'm OUT!.. kinda like right now .. peace   P.S.  I seen Piccola today.. havent seen him since 8th grade... it was cool I guess.. i love seeing old friends.  :)
