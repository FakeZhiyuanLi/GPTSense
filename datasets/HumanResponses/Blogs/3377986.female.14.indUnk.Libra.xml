      i dont know where liz is. and security came into forensics and took sarah bye bye. and that punk didnt tell me where he was taking her. im hoping that what im thinking happened, didnt happen. it prolly didnt. for all i know, liz is somewhere making out with her man while sarah is on her way to hawaii cause she won some prize thing from the office...  no more bad thoughts...  well i didnt walk to liz to class being as i cant find her. but i know she is here because UB said she is here, and UB doesnt lie. *damn loudspeaker, just reminded us that we dont get to go to lunch next, have to go to 5th!* anyways, we walked to the office to look for my lizzie and sarah but they werent there...and UB refused to kick the deans door down so i could c if they were in there. *hes an odd one i tell u. jk!!!* so ya, then we started walking to 3rd and then we got to my 3rd period class. then we stood there and talked for a while, long enough to b a little extra late to class. then stupid security yelled at us to go to class. so we did. then mr. hernandez gave me the " ur always late and its starting to piss me off" look. he obviously doesnt understand that i have a good reason for this, *c, previous post* so i went to my seat and started doing this. cool, huh?  later that day...  so ya. turns out what i thought was going to happen did happen. lets just hope that everything is going to b ok. i really think things will b ok.   way later that day...  i went to my little cousins dance thingy. it was really nice. but it made me realize how much talent i lack. oh well. anyways- it was at the fox theater. basically the whole town of delano was jammed in there. my cousins dance studio is in delano but they hold their performances here all the time. well, now to my point... there is hot guys in delano!!! i swear it was like hot guy town. and i got to sit next to one...but that punk had a girlfriend. i got to listen to them exchange spit for the whole thing. oh well. he was still hot. so ya. thats basically where i spent my evening. then my auntie needed to go to walmart. *target is better* then we went to sonic. now im home. yup. thats basically it...

      Ugh... I have to pee and stupid Mr. Hernandez wont let me go because its become a 'problem'. w/e. problem my butt. He says i come in late everyday anyways so i should go to the restroom then. im not late because of the restroom. im late because i halfway walk liz to class and then me and UB take our sweet time getting to class. so obviously that gives me no time to pee, i explained this to mr. hernandez but he doesnt seem to understand. hes gay  anyways- how goes it? im supposed to be 'exploring' kern learn or whatever but my computer for some reason doesnt want to let me on. so ya. Todays like the last full day of school. meh. kinda happy about it. i need time away from school. i need a break. *not that watching my baby fabian and julisa is a break but i enjoy it more than school* i know its going to b a busy summer but im kind of looking forward to it. if i keep myself busy i won have time to think. unless i think while i am busy...oh no...meh, w/e... g2g. bye!

      Hey everyone *again with the 'everyone'*. lets try again.  Hey everyone that comes here. my weeked was ok. here it goes:  Friday- Liz came home with me because she always comes home with me on early out days. I met Mike, he seems nice. hes funny too. we got home and i made macaroni and cheese for me and liz. then she left because her mother came and they were going to Mervyns. Then i went to the hall where Ivonne was having her quinceanera. We helped her decorate and then we rehearsed a little. it was fun. everyone is really cool. the guys were all really cool until i founf out some stuff i didnt want to know. but oh well. they r still pretty cool. sometimes. then my dad picked me up and we took Carlos and Diana home. then i went to go pick up my hideous dress... i swear it was that ugly. i dont know what Ivonne was thinking when she chose it. we were supposed to get a pretty different one but that didnt happen. we did get a discount though. *the lady herself prolly realized how ugly they were and felt sry us...* i also bought my shoes. theyre pretty. then i went home and got online for a while. then i went to bed.  Saturday-  i got up and cleaned house a little. then i went to get my hair done. then i came home and made myself pretty *tee hee, me pretty...* then i went to Ivonnes houese. then we left for the church in a limo. that was fun. we did the church thingy and i had the bread thingy. then we took pictures and went back in the limo. then the boys took the ice where the apple cider was and put it down our shirts. it was not fun. i was mad and my dress was wet. then the driver took us to the 7 Eleven to buy a camera. then we went back to hall to hang out and wait for the party to start. so we waited and waited. finally it started. then it was starting to get fun. then my parents got there and i gave them food. they stayed a couple of hours and then left. then some guy asked me to dance and i said sure *i still dont know what his name was*. then we went outside for a little bit. came back in. then another guy asked me to dance. i recognized him from somewhere so i saqid ok. so we danced for a while and i wanted to get away already. so i told him i was thirsty. turns out he was thirsty too. so he came with me. so we had something to drink and then he asked for my number. first of all my father would die if any guy called me, let alone a 17 year old guy. second of all, he was starting to bug and i really didnt want to give it to him. he was nice though so i gave him lizzie's cell phone number. i also lied to him and told him a had a boyfriend so he would back up a little. i said bye to him and i went to sit down. *he kept looking at me and i was weirded out* then Yvonne's boyfriend *different chick* got there and he was nice enough to pretend to be my boyfriend. tee hee. so him and i danced and it was fun. so ya. that was that. then i went home. i was tired. any my feet were killing me. i got home close to midnite.  Sunday- sunday i was home. for a while. then i went to my grandmas. nothing special. then i went home. then i got online. i talked to ub. it was fun. *come to think of it, its always fun when i talk to ub...*  Oh, Jose *thats the dudes name. the one that asked for my number* called me on sunday. but i wasnt with liz when he called. i was supposed to call him back but i forgot. oh well. ill call eventually...

      Hello. I'm in keyboaring and it is still gay just in case u were wodering. im really bored. i guess i could tell u about my weekend even though it is already wednesday *did i spell that right?*. well here it goes:  Friday- I went to San Diego and if u know me and and read my xanga u should already know about that. if not, here is a quick recap: hot marines, hot frat boys, nice graduation, way too much fun...  Saturday: Saturday was really fun. well not the morning. during the morning i just cleaned house and watched the kids while my mom got ready for some party thing that her and my dad went to. they left at around 7 PM. and edgar, me, julisa, and fabian *siblings* were left alone. i put fabian to sleep and then i decided i was bored and called my mom to ask if it was ok if liz spent the nite. she said it was fine. so i called liz and told her to drag her butt over. so she did. and thank god she brought food with her and saved us. so she got there and we ate and then we somehow ended up in the bath tub *with clothes on*. then my brother was on the phone and me and liz were just laying there in the tub talking. then my brother comes over and turns on the shower! liz ran out but i was soaked...it was gay...then i took a shower and then liz took a shower. then edgar and liz decided that they wanted to play yathzee so they made me play too. well that lasted almost five munites until we got bored....    Sunday:...so then we went into the living room and just hung out until like 1 o'clock in the morning when my parents got home. my dad had a few beers so he was trying to b funny *trying being the cue word*. anyways- edgar and liz decided to pull an all-nighter. no, it wasnt fun. first they tried to make me stay up with them. and if u know me, u know that i need sleep. its like my drug... so i went to sleep thinking "meh, theyll get bored soon and go to sleep" i was wrong. they were awake the whole freaking nite. and then just for 'kicks' they wake me up at 5 AM... "vanessa!!! look! the sun is coming up!" and i was like  "joy..." argh. i was mad. so i went back to sleep and they stayed awake. i think edgar went to sleep like at 7 AM and liz stayed awake. i woke again at 10. then we all got up. then lizzie's dad called and said he was i town so he took liz out for breakfast. so liz left. then my parents went somewhere and they took the kids *thank the lord* so i was home alone with edgar. i guess him and carl had plans to go to the movies and me and liz were going to tag along but turns out they didnt go. so ya. but then liz wanted to go after her meeting *shes a Jehova Witness* so we decided to go then. ub *ubaldo* came with us. it was fun. we met him at the arcade and we watched him play ddr. *hes good* i saw lots of ppl there: ivonne ibarra, mandy and claire from compton and titus! titus is funny. then we bought tickets and ub asked for a job application but they didnt have any at the moment or something like that. so then we went to the movie.  then we were pissed cause we missed the freakin previews!!! *whos fault is that? huh, ub?!! punk...* we watched mean girls! it was hilarious! i really liked it. after the movie we went back to the arcade and liz and i 'attempted' to play ddr. she was pretty good. im a different story...then ub played and he kept stepping on my toes... *punk* so liz and i left him there cause we had to go home. we said bye bye but i dont think he was listening... *punk* so ya. thats basically it. sry so long but i am really bored... i so dont need keyboarding...  PS: i won my debate and now i have to go against frank on friday...maybe i'll magically get sick...

      Hello! this is my very first blogger thingy. i was so extremely bored in keyboarding and i guess xanga is restricted and i cant work on that. so i started looking through google and i came across this. it took me a while to figure out what it was. tee hee. but then i remembered that carl had one. then i decided i wanted one because this is definitely much more entertaining than sending pointless emails to myself for a grade. come on, no offense, but if you have come to a point in your life when you are in high school and you cant send an email then you have problems. i am definitely not going to sit here and 'learn' how to create an email account and then email myself. so anyways- how is life? mine is ok but sometimes oh so very confusing. things sometimes dont make much sense *not that they ever did to begin with but u get what im saying right?* anymore. ugh. but oh well. ill live. i always do. *knock on wood* well i just remembered that i have to debate at lunch and that bugs me. y should i have to waste my valuable lunch time debating? isnt that what class time is for? grrr... gago is really gay now. i dont know what his problem is. today i came into class and everyone is talking about his upcoming vasectomy. dont ask me. i walked in late. so ya. i guess hes been really stressed lately but that is still no excuse to b a punk. well im gonna go. im prolly really boring anyways. but its not like i made u come here, so whos fault is it?... yes, i know i am pathetic. but u also have to understand how extremely bored i am. well  guess i will talk to u all later.

On Wednesday i went to a movie with my uncle, edgar, and liz. it was fun. we all decided we wanted to ride the GET bus. so we did. it took about an hour to get us all the way to Edwards, but only seemed like 10 minutes. it was really fun. we took pics. if u wanna c them ask lizzie. *Worldofmoz89* So liz and i were sitting there on the bus and decided we wanted to sing. so we did. we wanted to sing that one song, my girl, by the temptations, but we didnt remember how it began. so we asked this random man that sat next to edgar. and he knew it! *ive got sunshine, on a cloudy day* woo hoo! then we were excited. then we sang the whole song out loud. im sure ppl were annoyed...poor them. oh well. so ya. that was fun...  well im gonna go now. i need a nap...

      Hey guys. I just realized that like school is out, meaning i dont have keyboarding anymore and i could totally go back to my Xanga and stuff but i kinda got attached to this journal thingy. so i decided to keep it.   On another note...  my parents made me go to church today. my family doesnt really go to church unless were like really broke or they think i have a boyfriend. I know were not like swimming in money but i know we have enough. and i definitely do not have a boyfriend. of course, my parents arent too bright so they prolly think i do. someone should let them know its like impossible for me to have a boyfriend even if they were ok with it. anyways- that was weird.   My summers been ok. nothing too fun. ok, not really fun at all. no offense to my mom and dear brother but i want them to go to work already. i guess theyre both working with my dad but not for like another week. with them gone, it would just b me, fabian, and julie. true, i would have to watch them like 24/7 but that would b nothing new. my point is: i want them to leave already! all they do is yell at eachother 24/7 and edgar is always fighting with julisa and never wants to hold fabian. so ya. they need to go. *plus i get money for babysitting* well im going to go. my parents went to the hospital to visit some work friend that had surgery or something and guess what? i have to watch the kids. i should just call them mine. well laters.  PS. i had STARBUCKS yesterday. yummy...
