						   And I'm feeling bad about it. Alot of things have happened recently, but writing up an entry about it hasn't exactly made its way on the top of my list.  Anyway, I'm using my new computer as we speak. ^^ The only problem with it is the CD-RW drive, which for some reason chooses not to work. I'm gonna have to take it out and get a good look at it, but for now I've just installed a CD-ROM.  Bah...my brain's too scrambled right now. I'll try back tomorrow and give a more thorough update.

						   Ever get the feeling that your computer is aware of what goes on around it? O.o I swear, my Laptop knows I am going to replace it on Friday with a PC Desktop, because the damn thing rolled over and died on me on Saturday. I mean...for no reason. The hard drive erased, and for a couple of hours I couldn't even reinstall the OS.   Like it just said..."*#&*$# You!" *dies*  Anyway, after exhausting my extensive powers over the technological, I finally managed to get it up and running again. But, Sorry Mac G3... I love you, but I'm still replacing you. :P  My brother's graduation was today. I even managed to go through the entire day without arguing with my mother. Go me.  But now I'm tired. This post is probably garbage, but hell.

						   Well, this is why I always have trouble waking up in the morning; it's 4:15am and I feel like I can't go back to sleep. I don't know whether it's because I have alot on my mind or what, but it's blowing me that I can't go back to bed and I have work in the morning.  Bad brain, bad! Roll over, play dead... or something.  Grr... who the hell makes infomercials? One I'm watching now is for some sort of  cream that gives the buyer an instant tan. No harmful sun rays, all for the low low price of---- wait. Hah, I don't need some crazy tanning cream. I have a perpetual one year round, thank you very much. :P  No, but seriously...things like that always make me think about the remarkably low self esteem in the world(as if I'm one to talk!). Who cares if you don't have a dark tan? Who cares if you don't lose 99 pounds in one hour(for 99 "easy" payments of 29.99)? I'm awake, but you all need to be awake too. Wake up and realize that some of the worrying you do about yourselves are collectively stupid.  /minirant.  Woo, I feel better. And only 4:25 to boot. Maybe I can get back to sleep...

						   It's amazing what coffee can do to a girl. About ten minutes after finishing that post, I finally decided to roll myself out of bed and go bean-hunting. Just so happened that I had a packet of Maxwell Instacoffee hiding in my dresser drawer... so, one cup of java later, I'm feeling some semblance of my humanity.  Last week, I finally became tired of using this G3 Laptop(alas, Wallstreet you served me well), and started searching for a decent PC Desktop to use. It's kinda blasphemy in this house, to use a PC... since we're all Mac-heads. But... it kinda blows to not be able to do alot of things online just because I'm using a Mac.  So, I was looking for computer online... ran across this neat site called Craigslist.org. That place kicks serious ass, people. It's basically one big classified listing. Everything from jobs to personals to Free crap are listed. Anyway, their DC listing was crawling with great deals on comps(as well as other stuff). In fact, that was where I ultimately found my PC.  I went to check it out last Sunday... not bad, a HP Pavilion 8690c, I think. Keep in mind, I'm a techie, so I did actually sit down and take a good look at its innards. There was some superficial rusting on the outside(God only knows how that happened), but otherwise in peak condition. Not bad for a 2000 model. Furthermore, not bad for 264 bucks. So what's the catch? It doesn't come with a monitor. Or a mouse...which kind of sucks.  Now, I keep around random PC parts in my room... so after coffee, I started digging. Found two computer mice... now all I need is a monitor.  Maybe craigslist has one for free...or cheap...

						   Have you ever woken up, but seriously didn't want to wake up, so you try and go back to sleep but wake up like five minutes later? >.  Oh well. It's 10:27, and I feel ultra groggy. I probably wouldn't have made it to my computer in the first place if it wasn't positioned right next to me. Go laziness, go!  Bah. Having a brain fart, so I'll just leave off here. Probably pick up later.  Coffeeeee.....

						   Well, I'll start off by being honest. This is my first ever weblog... no small feat for a girl claiming to be the nerdiest of the computer nerds. I've never really thought that I would have the patience to sit down every day(or every other day for that matter) and type out my life. But then I realized... I probably need this. Maybe if it's written down, I'll finally be able to understand the vortex of words and ideas that are defined as my thoughts. Maybe I won't be quite so much the atypical angst-driven seventeen year old, and more the constantly thinking mature individual.  Or maybe I just don't have a life. *koffs*  In either case... we'll see how this goes. Who knows, it might be successful.  Onwards to more pressing stuff. Today they held the Reagan funeral procession(which consequently curtailed my movement - the crowds here in DC were really nasty). I've never had love for the man, personally. Even though he had a good personality, you could never accuse the man of being competent in dealing with some aspects of his job. Still, you have to respect anyone brave(or in Bush Jr's case, foolish) enough to sit in the "coveted" oval office for four or more years.  I have to give my respect to Reagan's wife, though. She held herself up very nicely, despite being paraded across the country(along with her husband's casket). There's a quiet nobility about her in the footage. It's admirable. Everyone may be saluting your husband, but I salute you.  Thus sayeth  The Refined Lady
