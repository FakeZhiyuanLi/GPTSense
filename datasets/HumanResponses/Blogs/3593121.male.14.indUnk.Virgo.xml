      The Legend of Ron Burgundy has been seen.&nbsp; Will Farrell has acted, cameos have occurred. In the end, it all came together.  &nbsp;  Roy (hah, fix)&nbsp;and me went to see Anchorman. Ron and me laughed.  &nbsp;  The movie was more a somewhat entertaining story then a fullout comedy. It was still a very good movie and if I had one, my hat would be off to the actors. Will Farrell's movie career has started off with a bang and it continues to move full speed ahead.  &nbsp;  JorKen's ranking:&nbsp;3 out of 5  &nbsp;  A very nice movie, a little over-hyped, but still very much worth seeing.

      This new template, if I can see correctly, if purple.  And Jorken, if you dislike it, just tell me.  Color blindness-- very embarassing.  .... I think this will be better when school starts. :D

      I'll agree with you there.  It was only alright. Worse than the first time. Hee.  We're being uber-latenighters.

      Today (yesterday?) I saw Spiderman 2. Worth the 8 bucks? Nope.  Few good things can be said about this movie. The effects were better then expected, and the plot managed to make sense. The surprising thing about this movie, was the fact that it was still better then the first.    JorKens ranking: 2 out of 5  Lacked in many areas, but still managed to entertain.

      Roy came to me with the idea for a multiblog. Ideas like that come around once every few months or so. Naturally, I jumped in. Soon it will be a great time for my lack of writing skill to truly shine! score!    This is going to be interesting.

      Yay! My ambition came true. Props to  urlLink JorKen , the other member of this blog as of now.  Anyway, this is our multi-member blog, like it or not. Even though there won't be many people reading it to have that strong of an opinion, anyway.  Nonetheless, here we go.  I originally thought this would be a blog to like record school life, but we can change that to 'school life and such'.  So I'll post again when the such part is developed.   This blog is oddly giving me great joy. :D   Cheers.

      See, I'd give Fahrenheit 9/11 more of a 4.75-sort-of ranking.  And this is to prove that Jorken has not taken over our group blog, as he so thinks he has.  Heh. I plan to write more when school begins.  Yea.  Haha.... Bush is being ridiculed again... on Conan. Props to Kerry.  Besides his wife.  Although you've gotta love the ketchup.

      Yes, continuing on our movie binge, me and Roy saw Fahrenheit 9/11.  Was the movie an attack at Bush? Yes. Was it good? Yes.  &nbsp;  You may be thinking, hey, don't documentaries suck? No,no they don't.  Some call Michael Moore an oddball, sure, it works. I still liked the movie.  &nbsp;  The movie talked about 9/11, the Bush family's connections, and the war. There really isn't much else to say about it. It was a comedy, a drama, and a horror all at the same time. Im not just complimenting this movie because I wanted Gore to win, I think its a great flick.  &nbsp;  There was a line in the movie, Bush says to Michael Moore "Hah, get some real work(job)"  Moral of the story? Don't fuck with a movie director. Hah.   JorKen's ranking:&nbsp;3.5 out of 5   3 points because of the movies greatness.  .5 because they made fun of Fox&nbsp;Broadcasting &nbsp;

       JorKen.... has been grounded :(     &nbsp;   Yes, it is as depressing as it sounds..... I am not going to be online for a while. Maybe, just MAYBE I will get on stealthily for a few minutes at a time.     &nbsp;   Fear not, is it just the computer, JorKen shall be around as usual, hopefully.   &nbsp;  Just to inform you all,  All Quiet on the Western Front , sucks. No,&nbsp;it single handedly ruined my afternoon, it was that bad.  &nbsp;

       I broke the ice, if you will.  There was quite a prolonged silence.... (hem hem-- Jorken. hee.  only kidding.)  Right now, I'm watching 'Hell Freezes Over' on tape, and it's awesome.  Although until recently, Henley hasn't really done anything except play maracas, and pull a few Garfunkels by just sitting on a bench and singing.   Kind of bland.  But they're doing 'Life in the Fast Lane' right now, so he's playing drums.  Don't fret.  And then there's this one unidentifed guy playing all the cool guitar solos, that I, nor my dad for that matter, can put a name to.  But other than that, it's very cool.   Timothy B. Schmitt with his whacked out  urlLink girly-man hair  (shout-out to Ahhnold.), and his old-school clothing.  And for those of you who are immune to superb California-country-70s-rock, this is the Eagles.    Once again, this blog will be much more exciting when school starts, I presume.  Seeing as that was my original intention for this with JorKen-- a school-oriented blog.  Anyway, cheers to your health.   And Jorken rocks.  :D

       Hi.      If you don't mind, Jorken, I switched our template.  And even though everything looks so pale, variety is good for everything.  So as far as I know, it's sticking.      Um, well. Not really much going on with me.  I went to see Norah Jones at the Opry on Thursday, which was awesome.  And I'm 2/3rds done with Dune, one of the most tedious books ever written.  And school begins in a week.  I can't believe that we have to go back to school again.  I was just getting into my summer groove.  Kind of.  And because I have nothing else to say, really, I'll just quote the song stuck in my head right now.     'Whoa, whoa, what I want to know, where does the time go?'-- 'Uncle John's Band' by Grateful Dead.  How fitting.    As I've said previously, this blog'll blossom into a masculine-flower-of-wittyness-and-interest-by-way-of-our-blog-posts when school starts, and we'll actually have more things to write about. Yea. Adios.  Is this font orange?
