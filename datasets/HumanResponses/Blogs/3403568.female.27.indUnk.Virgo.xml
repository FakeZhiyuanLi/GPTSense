      I made it back to Curves on Wednesday.  It was my first day back after getting over the stomach flu.  I worked out pretty hard, and made it around the circuit the first two times ok...but that third time I really started dragging, and had to slow it down a bit. That's ok though, I'm just glad I was able to go and work out again.  But, then over the next few days my sinus infection kept getting worse, and I had to go to the doc for some antibiotics.  So, I didn't make it back to Curves on Friday.  Then it was closed yesterday, and will be closed tomorrow, for Memorial Day. :-(    It will work out though...Tuesday is the first day of a new month, and can be a new start for me also!  Hopefully I can make it through the month without any health problems (my niece's are still sick though, so that may be hard).  I have marked on my calender the days I want to try and make it to Curves to workout, and I have some star stickers (that my niece helped me pick out), to put on each day that I actually make it.  Ok...kind of cheesy...but at this point I'll take any extra motivation I can get. :)    I've almost finished unpacking.  I want to work on keeping better track of my finances, and of what I'm eating.  I got a small notepad to keep in my purse, and I'm determined to write down everything I eat, and everything I spend this month.  I know it's not going to be easy...as I've tried this before, and never seem to stick to it...but I'm going to try it again.  I'm also going to make myself post it on here at the end of each week...just as extra accountability.  So...if any of you don't begin seeing my weekly totals....someone e-mail me and ask where they are! *LOL*  Ok...for this first week of June....here are my plans.... Sunday 30th -  clean house, get ready for the week, finish unpacking Monday 31st -  take my nieces and nephew out to see Shrek II, spend time with family Tuesday 1st -  Curves workout after work  Wednesday 2nd - go to mom's/sister's to help set up for garage sale Thursday 3rd - Curves workout after work - go to help with garage sale Friday 4th - Roller Hockey after work - or go to help with garage sale Saturday 5th - Curves workout in the morning - then go to help with garage sale

      Ok, tomorrow is a new day, and I think I'm ready to get back to it (slowly).  I'm going to go to Curves after work tomorrow.  I will take it easy, and do as much as I can.  I've been drinking a LOT of water, and my muscles aren't as sore/achy as they were.  My stomach is much better now.  My head/sinus is still bothering me, but it's getting better.    I've also been working on some other aspects of my life (besides my health/fitness).  In my quest to try and be more social and meet new people....I've checked into going to a Church that isn't too far...and they have a YAG (Young Adults Group - ages 18 to 35), that meet and have social outings, etc.  I think I'm going to try and go to the service on Sunday, and then try and make the next YAG meeting too.  I've also sent an e-mail to a Rollerblade Club nearby.  I wanted to find out if they offer lessons (I've already got the skates and safety equipemnt - bought it two years ago...just don't use it).  So...we'll see how it all works out.    My niece, Morgan, is doing a little better today.  She is still running fever off and on.  My mom did manage to get her to eat a few bites at lunch today though. It's the first food she's ate in the past couple of days.  She's still drinking a lot of liquids, and her stomach seems to be doing a little better. I'm sure the antibiotics for the bronchitis aren't helping her stomach any though. Hopefully she's getting to the end of this awful viral mess.  My mother seems to be doing better too.    Something to look forward to.... Next month I'm going on a trip with my mother, and her four sisters (my aunts), my grandmother, my sister, and a couple of my cousins.  It's going to be a girls trip to the coast (Galveston).  We're going to fly from here to Houston...where we'll meet one of my aunts, and then we'll all drive down to the coast. One of my aunts was diagnosed last year with MS (multiple sclerosis), and isn't able to make a really long car trip; and my grandmother isn't in the greatest of health...so that's why we're flying most of the way. About 10 years ago we began taking a "girl's trip" once or twice a year.  But, with my aunts health steadily getting worse, and my grandmother getting older...this may be one of the last trips we're able to all go on together.  It's going to be fun though. We're trying to plan some activities, and then leave some time open too...to give everyone time to move at their own pace and enjoy everything.  We're just going for a long weekend...but it should be a good time.   Ok...I really have to get my butt in bed.  That's one thing I definately need to work on...is my insomnia. :-)

      I got my annual evaluation at work today.  It was fine, they all had good things to say.  It just got me to thinking though....about where I am in life....where I thought I would be....and where I want to be.  None of them seem to match.    Don't get me wrong...my job is pretty good, and I make decent money (for this area, and for not having completed my degree).  I'm just not happy with what I'm doing.  It's just a job....just something I originally took to help pay the bills while I finished school etc.  Of course, then life got in the way....and it's turned into a four-year detour.  Being completely honest though....I'm not sure where it is I'd like to go...or what I'd like to be doing.  I keep thinking about finishing school and getting my teaching certification.  I just don't know that I have the energy for it.  I would be interested in kindergarten/first grades, or in teaching science.  *LOL* I guess that's a big jump there.  I've also thought about just finishing my business degree, and then going from there (I'd only have about a year and a half left).  But...there is the issue of time (how to go to school, study, work full time, etc), and money.    Realistically I need to pay off my debt first, and then try to come up with the money for school.  However, that means waiting another 2 or 3 years.  Also, with as tight as money is now....it might even be longer than that...and I'm not making up any ground as I go...just slowly slipping farther back.  I really hate the idea of having to take out a student loan again (my other one is paid off now)...but I'm not seeing any other way I could financially afford to finish school...and get in a position where I could earn a better living, and actually begin doing something I cared about and enjoyed.   *sigh*....anyway....just thinking about things......

      It's Monday...and actually it hasn't been that bad. :-)  I made it through work, without passing out and ending up in the floor again.    My stomach is doing fine today.  My head and ears aren't there yet....still stuffy, and achy....pretty much just a dull sinus pressure type headache all day long.  And whatever this virus is...it's making my joints and muscles really sore and achy.  My legs are so sore...about like when you really over-do-it at the gym or something...and then my wrists (which I have problems with tendenitis in occasionally) are very tender and weak.  So, I decided not to go to Curves today.  I'll have to see how I'm doing tomorrow after work.  I really want to get back to it....but I don't want to push things too fast.    My youngest niece, Morgan (she's almost 4 yrs old), came down with this stomach flu/virus too.  Then she also got bronchitis on top of it.  My sister spent most of the night in the emergency room with her (until 3AM this morning).  When I called to check on her a little while ago, they said she is doing a little better, and her fever is staying down better with the meds.  I hate it when the little ones get sick. :(   Fortunately, her sister Sydney (who's almost 6 yrs old), hasn't gotten it yet, and is doing great.  But, my poor mom, who helped me this past week when I passed out at work etc, seems to be coming down with it now.  So far she says it hasn't hit full force, but it's creeping up on her (a little fever, queasy stomach, etc). *sigh*  We're all doing everything we can to break the cycle (washing hands, using antibacterials, etc). Hopefully this mess will be gone soon.

      *sigh* Well, I didn't make it through work yesterday.  I did ok until lunch.  I ate, and then shortly afterwards got sick, and ended up passing out again.  Mom came and took me home, and I slept for several hours.  Then she took me back to her house, where I spent the night.    I've been doing better today.  My stomach has been a little quesy at times, but not too bad.  My head (sinus/allergies) is still getting me though.  I ended up not going to my cousin's wedding.  I decided she didn't need someone there who might end up passing out and making a scene at her wedding.  I hope it went ok...she has been sick with this stomach flu too, and had to go to the emergency room the night before her wedding.  This stomach flu is awful.   Anyway....hopefully I'm about at the end of it.  I can't afford to miss anymore days at work.  I also want to get back to going to CURVES and working out.  I have to finish unpacking my apartment too.    Ok...well...life goes on.  It's time for bed now though.....

      It's been a long, rough week.  I came down with an awful viral stomach flu that has been going around.  I've also been covering two offices at work (while someone else is out on leave for a month), so I guess I pushed myself too far.  Yesterday I passed out at work.  They said I got up (to go to the printer), and just fell out in the floor.  My right side is sore and bruised from where I fell.  It scared everyone in the office to death.  They called 911 and the paramedics came.  My blood pressure was a bit high, I had a 103.4 temperature, and they said I was very dehydrated.  Uuuggghhh.  So, (since I wouldn't let them take me to the emergency room), they called my mother and sister, and they came and took me home.  I slept all day yesterday.    I am stubborn though.  I actually went back to work today.  I still didn't feel well, but I didn't seem to be running a temp anymore, and my stomach had settled down some.  I made it through the day, even worked 30 minutes overtime, but was so completely exhausted when I got home.  I crashed on the couch the minute I walked in the door, and slept for three hours (that's why I'm still up at 10:30PM tonight..).  I am going to try and make it through the day tomorrow too.  Since we are already short one person at work, I really hate to be out.  Besides, I can't afford the lost hours/pay.  But, on the bright side...the lady who is out will be back on Monday, and then things should slow down a bit, and not be so crazy.    I also have my cousin's wedding to go to on Saturday.  I feel guilty, because I so want to just stay home and rest and not go...but I know that's not right.  Anyway, it's not until 7PM Saturday, so I could sleep in late.    I think I'm going to try and go workout at Curves on Saturday morning.  I think I'll just take it nice and slow....since it will be my first day back after being sick.  Then hopefully I can get things back on track on Monday.   Here's looking forward to a new week!

      Okay, tomorrow begins a new week.  My goal is to go to Curves on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  I want to also do some walking on the days inbetween.  I need to make sure I take my lunch to work each day.  I need to keep my glass of ice water on my desk at all times.  No sodas!!!    With my sinus/allergies bothering me, it makes it harder, because I don't feel great, and I get stressed more easily.    I need to find a way to meet new people around here.  I know lonelyness feeds into my boredom, depression, stress and overeating.  I'm just not sure how to go about meeing anyone.  Maybe just getting out and walking, I'll be able to meet some of the people here.  Maybe I can also check around at the YMCA, and other places for volunterr opportunities.  If I start going back to the church I used to go to, maybe I can get involved in some activities there.  I just don't know about making that drive each week.    I've had this sharp pain/cramp in my left thigh tonight.  I don't know if it's just sore from exercising or what.

      I went to workout at Curves again today.  It seemed to go faster.  I need to figure out other moves to do on the recovery stations.    I still haven't gotten all my unpacking done (Note: I moved into a new apartment at the first of May).  I just can't get motivated to work on it.  My head (sinus/allergies) are bothering me tonight.  I think it was because I went into a shop today that had two resident cats.  Apparently my allergy to cats hasn't went away.  :(

      Today after work, I went to Curves for my second workout.  There were more people there today.  I did a good workout.  I also bought the "Members Guide", which outlines the Curves diet plan.  It says to wait until you've been working out at Curves for a month, before you decide whether or not to diet also.    I also started my period today.  I almost didn't go workout, but I'm glad I did.  I always feel more awake after working out. However, my face got bright red, and my legs were itching today.  I'm not sure what that's about.  I'm drinking more water and less sodas.  I'm eating more veggies, and cutting down on the sweets.

      ( Note: Before I began this blog, I was keeping a written journal...so I'm going to copy some of my entries from there to here...)  Today is Mother's Day.  I went out to eat with mom, grandma, and pa.  I also cooked grilled chicken, broccoli, and veggies (zucchini, squash, tomatoes, mushrooms, carrots, sweet potatoes), so I would have healthy foods for the week.    Tomorrow is going to be hard. I am going to try and cut out all sodas.  I figured that I usually drink about 4 a day at work.  So 4 a day X 5 days a week X 4 weeks = $40 a month in sodas, plus all the empty calories, sugar, etc.  Uuuggghhh!  That is enough money to cover my membership at CURVES!!!

      Wow...it's a new month! I'm ready!    I actually kept track of everything I spent today, and of everything I ate! I also went to Curves after work and had a good workout! :-) So far I am on track with the goals (for the week) I posted on Sunday.    I had so much fun yesterday with my nieces and nephew (and mom, sister, and sister's fiance).  We all took the kids to see 'Shrek 2' (it was great!), and then we went to Chuck E. Cheese.  We had a birthday cake for the kids, and Chuck E. came over and sang and danced with them.  It was fun.    Then today, I made sure I had my notepad in my purse, and I kept up with everything. Okay...okay...I know it's only one day...but hey...I still did it! *lol*  Anyway....my eating today wasn't great (okay, it was pretty bad)...but I am cutting down on the sodas, and I'm not as bad on the sweets.  It's a start. :-)   Log for Tuesday, June 1st:   - 7:00AM Ate a "Swanson's Great Starts: Sausage, Egg, & Cheese Croissant" for breakfast, and drank a big glass of water  - 7:20AM Spent $15.01 on gas ($1.89 a gallon...ouch!)  - 9:41AM Really stressed out at work, lack of sleep is getting to me, sinus headache...gave in and spent 70cents to get a package of Donut Sticks out of the vending machine...at them with a glass of water   - 11:10AM Need a break from the phones and computer...so I took 15 minutes and went and ate 1/2 of the sandwich I brought for lunch (turkey breast, mayo, dill pickle, on multi-grain-whole-wheat bread), drank another glass of water, and then when I got back to my desk I ate two of the little midgee tootsie rolls  - 1:15PM Lunch break...ate the other 1/2 of my sandwich, drank a Diet Dr. Pepper (my only soda all day!!! I usually have 4-5)...spent 50cents for the soda  - 3:30PM Left work, and went to Curves to workout  - 5:15PM At home, ate 2 small slices of a Totinos Supreme Pizza and drank a glass of water   Geez....I really have to work on my eating.  I need to start bringing some fruit or veggies for snacks...maybe it will help me stay away from the vending machine when I get stressed or tired.
