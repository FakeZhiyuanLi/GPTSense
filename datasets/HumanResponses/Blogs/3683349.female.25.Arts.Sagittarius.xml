      It's raining.  Again.  Shocking, I know...  At least I don't have to go out in it.  Well, not yet anyway.  Church was oh so exciting this morning.  I wish we didn't have to do two services.  I liked at RPC when I only had to sing one service.  I didn't make as much, but... Talked to mom and dad today.  I think I'm ready to go see them.  I am always apprehensive about flying, and that is a quite a long flight, but it will be good to see them and get out of the country.  I think this will help set some things back on track for me.  I need it desperately.

      OK, I seriously need to win the lottery.  And here's why... I went to the movies tonight.  I paid $9.50 for my ticket.  That's nine dollars and fifty cents of my hard earned money to buy myself two hours of entertainment (if that).  That works out to roughly eight cents per minute.  So here's my plan for my lotto winnings.  I'm going to build a movie theater where 1. the staff of the theater is actually empowered enough to make patrons be quiet, 2. that won't be a problem anyway, because all the patrons will be at least 23, and 3. if said patrons cannot seem to shut their big, fat mouths, for every minute he or she disrupts the movie experience, he or she will pay every other person in the theater 8 cents.  If you are going to fuck up my experience, you better be ready to pay for it.  Because you know what, hoochy little teeny-bopper?  Your "boyfriend" doesn't want to make out with you because he's trying to watch the freaking movie!!!!!  And rude black chick sitting seven seats away, you do not get "credit" for simply repeating the funny line from the movie.  Everyone in the theater got the joke the first time they heard it.  We don't need your stupid ass to translate it for us.  Mind you, none of this will happen in my theater.  On second thought, my theater is going to be for members only, like a country club.  You have to apply for membership and pay a monthly fee.  Maybe people just need to learn how to act in public.

      Here goes with the whole online journal thing.  Again.  I'm not going to make it all fancy or anything.  I'm just going to try to write.  Regularly.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I don't quite get it. I am smarter, fitter, and bolder than my potbellied brother ever could hope to be, yet he gets all the fame, fortune, and glory, not to mention Peach's heart. If only I was the first player in Super Mario Bros... things could have been different. Maybe I can make a comeback, now that I finally have my own game.. but probably not. After all, I'm just Luigi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I wish I was one of those people who could just make all these really profound statements on their blogs.  I wish I knew enouch about computers to have a really cool website.  I wish I was more photogenic.  I wish I kept my apartment cleaner.  I wish I didn't have so much credit card debt.  I wish I was thinner.

      Glad to be here.  Long flight.  Newsflash: People who don't "get" flying shouldn't be allowed on the same flights as the rest of us.  1) It is rude to let your child scream and not do anything to try to quiet him.  No one wants to hear your kid for 9 hours.  2) They have those size things in the airport for a reason.  If your bag doesn't fit in that, it's not going to fit in the bin, much less 3 of them!  Just suck it up and check it.  3) If the airlines are going to have a rule about carry-ons, they need to enforce it.  One means one, not your purse, your bag, your laptop, your kid's bags, your kid's stroller, and your kid's car seat.  4) It's a bad sign when you are waiting to get on a plane, and there are 7 stollers piled by the door in the jetway.  And finally 5) Note to travel agent: NEVER SEAT ME IN BETWEEN INDIAN MOM AND HER FOUR KIDS!

      In Germany visiting the 'rents.  Having a good time.  AWESOME weather.  But still having something of an existential crisis.  Mom and Dad both have spoken to me about grad school.  I WANT a masters... but when Dad was talking to me, I started crying (I don't even know where that came from...)  I CANNOT go back to being a poor college student.  Ever.  Those days are long gone.  Not that I'm super rich now or anything, but I can pay my bills and I have a car that I like, a place of my own... I'm fairly sure I want a masters in music, but not sure enough to pursue it right now.  Plus, no one I work with has their masters, and they all have successful programs.  And what if I don't want another music degree.  What do I do then????  This is too much to think about.  My dad said, "You have to have goals, or life will just pass you by."  And I understand his thinking in that other opportunities come out of having a higher degree.  But right now, I don't want to think about the future.  It looks too bleak.  I'm still alone, and will be forever.  I can't think about the future without thinking about that.
