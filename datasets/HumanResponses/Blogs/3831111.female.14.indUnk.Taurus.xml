      i might have to go to the hospital and get the evil stupid injection on my arm....its not nice....:( i know its gonna break like three of my arms and the pain wont leave till i eat off all the arms...no, im not making sence.   yea and ive done pretty much nothing during the two weeks in japan, although i was going to have the best summer holiday ever, its the most boring summer holiday ive ever spent. its hot, it stinks. its hot, it sucks. its hot, it boers me. so its not nice.  i think im forgeting my english and its also not gooooood cuz i have to go back to school at the end of august and im supposed to be able to speak english like mad and get good grades on the work i do in english....oh well, ill say to my mom that i want to move to ESL so i can be with those stupid freaks from japan who think they are good at english and i actually can kill both of them...oops. the topic has kinda changed and i cant be bothered to look back and think what i was talking about.

      now im different! i mean, im not one of those "xanga" people...i dont dislike xanga, but i just dont like it...im not sure why, but probably cos all my friends have a blog from xanga. and i think its kind of weird... sorry if you are using xanga, dude  well well well, i hope cc (my gooody friend) is doing a good job. Kelpie (another nicccce friend) is leaving soon and there is gonna be a good bye party for her, which is supposed to be a big surprise...but cc already told me that things went wrong from the start...well, good luck guys! im here in japan, and im nothing to do with the party...lol (well i am, cos i was part of the planning, but i cant go anyways)  aww i miss my cat...hes so cute, so cute, and so cute. i can eat him. i mean i cant but i want...no, i dont want to, but if i try i can. sorry i dont make sence. but thats how awfully cute he is...  noow i have to spend my money....for kelpie :) since i cant come to the party, im gonna buy lots of nice things, may be lots of CHEAP things so i can buy even more, and give them to her when im back in europe. but the problem is that im not really allowed to go out alone...and my bike doesnt come off the stupid chain...so its not really possible to go in town and spend the nice money...  -------------i think its enough. so. okay. bye bye
