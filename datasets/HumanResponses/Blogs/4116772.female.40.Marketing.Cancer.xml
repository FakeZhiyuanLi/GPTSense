       Okay people, I think I am a little PMS so here it goes.  It is Friday afternoon, I have been working on paperwork all day.  I went over my minutes on my cell phone, which I have a plan that gives me 3500 anytime minutes and $5 for starting my free minutes at 7:00p.m.  I WENT OVER.  What the hell is that all about.  It is this ridiculous sales program I am doing right now.  The moral to this story is find a company land line.  Sprint is my plan, I worked 3 people over, even a nice dude with a stutter that challenged my patience and finally I got my over minutes reduced in cost and my plan upped another thousand minutes for only $10 more.  I am a mental case.  The fact that I use over 3500 minutes a month blows my mind.  That is over 2 hours a day on the phone.  Now I am in sales and I don't have a land line, but this is ridiculous.  I am learning to leave my cell at home, which is unheard of these days.  I rode 150 miles on my rode bike this weekend for charity (MS 150) and I had my phone with me (incase I got lost from my friend).  I got a job interview call while riding.  They just shouldn't be able to find me at all times.      LESSON FOR TODAY:  Try hard not to talk on the phone in the car as much as possible. And leave the phone at home sometimes when you go out with friends.  You actually can relax a bit when the phone stays home.

      I am sitting in my apartment, my home office, and I have an ear piece in my ear and am listening to a "sales" motivational "coach".  I am having an out of body experience because this stuff is sooooooooooooooo not me.  This guy can not stop talking about his kids, about himself, and how Rockstar he is at sales.  Blah blah blah......  "I want you to realize you have to keep focused on measuring results" "I found that I was more concerned with getting it done other than the quality"  What is this shit rocket science.  I understand sales is a purely self-motivated activity, it requires discipline, regiment and consistancy.  This is not for me.  I can't believe I am listening to this stuff right now...I feel like Tony Robbins is barking in my ear....same type of gig.  "you should be learning some things about what makes your "recipe" for sales work for you"  Challenge what you do. Change the way you do things.  It is the same lifes lessons for everything.

       I am completely and utterly unsure as to what I am doing here, but that is okay.  That is pretty much status quoe for most things.  I read a little bit about blogging and I thought....man, I love to talk, communicate, voice my opinion.  Why not.      Okay, so what do we do.  I am going to talk a little bit about myself and see what happens.  Well, as the title indicates I am 40.  I just turned 40.  No big deal really, I feel 30 and I believe I look somewhere in between.  I am single, have an unfulfilling job and looking for the meaning of life.  Nothing too out of the ordinary going on around here.  What I find cosmically interesting is that this mid-life "crisis" thing is an actual real thing.  I really don't feel it is a crisis, but an awaking of the mind to questioning what we are doing with our lives.  The uncertainty of it all could feel like a crisis and by all means sometimes it does for me, but it is sort of a freak out how all these questions and urgencies came smacking me in the head this year.  The stuff I read indicates that it is completely "normal" especially with women.  Apparrantly we really come into ourselves at 40.  Yeah for me.      So what is "normal".  Who the hell knows.
