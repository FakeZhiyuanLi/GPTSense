         Yesterday was one of the worst in recent memory just because it was the first day back from spring break. The break definatly awoke in me the desire for summer vacation... a lot. I woke up at 7:15 (Ick) and went to school. Getting back into the funk of things was all that really went on. We watched a new movie in Gerl called "Foyle's War" and I had an HP meeting 3rd and 4th period which was perhaps the most boring thing this side of the Atlantic Ocean, including people watching golf on TV. 5th period Math reminded me how much I hate that class and why I probably won't do it next year because all of my credits are taken care of. After school I played basketball by myself until around 4 and then I walked home. Nothing special went on at home either. I talked to people on messenger, joined another fantasy baseball league, and went to sleep without writing my blog because I was too tired. I did however look at other people's blogs and have come to the conclusion that this blog sucks ass compared to some others. I just got a free trail of xanga premium so I am going to do my best to trick out this site as much as possible.

                       I awoke for church and... you guessed it, went to church. Not much new happening there. I got home around one and checked email and wrote my blog for yesterday because of reasons last night. I worked out a perplexing trade in my fantasy baseball league. Besides that nothing really happened. I fell asleep at halftime during the Xavier Duke game and woke up just in time to see Duke win, the bastards. I didn't go to open gym because I was too tired and decided to watch TV instead. I watched Dream Job on  urlLink ESPN  and let it be known that Mike Hall is crap! Zach should have won, it was obvious! And if not Zach, then Aaron. Mike was barely better than Maggie Haskins, who I suspect as an alien bent on world domination. Sportscenter was to be her first step to brainwashing the American public. Caleb admits to falling for her spell. I have also come to the conclusion that  urlLink Michelle Wie  is hot, and she is undoubtably Aaron Koch's Asian goddess. That is all.

         I woke up around 9 and ate some breakfast that Lance made. Jason and I played some Soul Caliber 2 and tried to rip each other off in baseball trades, with no success. Lance left around 11 to do something at his mom's house and it suddenly dawned upon me that Soul Caliber 2 was due today at noon and Lance was not around to take me to Blockbuster. Luckily, Jason can drive, so we took the game back and while I was there I bought Halo for only $29.99! I had vowed that if I repeated my winning ways at poker night on Monday that I would buy Halo and I did... so I did.      Anyway, we got home and then Jason decided to take off for his house. Then I did some yard work with Lance, such as cutting down trees and packing up the lumber. Sortly after Lee called and we decided to hang out at my house. After Lance and I dropped off some gas at his mom's house, we picked him up.      Now, I know this may be quite embaressing, but Lee brought over some Magic cards he owned from eons ago and we proceded to play quite a few games. I pretty muched owned him, with the exception of of like 3 games because I couldn't get any mana.      Anyways, after that we played the co-op missions on Halo until around 11:30, beating two missions on Heroic in the process. Then my mom came home and Lee called his mom to get a ride home.      After Lee left, my mom went totally crazy on me because Lee was here too long and I wasn't spending any time with Lance, who she said had to sit in his bedroom all day because Lee was here. First of all, when he is not working, that's all Lance does anyway! He sits in the room on the bed watching TV. In fact, as I write this at 1:30 on Sunday I am going to get up and wager that that is what he is doing right now, this very second. Yep, I just went in there and that is what he is doing. Anyway, I argued that point and some others to my mom and I guess me making sense or proving her wrong is not allowed so she got all pissed about that. Then Lance came out of the bedroom (!!!) and heard what we were talking about and decided to get all rough and tough and "give me a talking to" in which I was ironically not allowed to talk. He said "Tyler gets this, and Tyler gets that.... blah blah blah blah... and Tyler doesn't care whose toes he steps on when he does things." Now, I wasn't allowed to talk, but keep in mind that every single time Lee or Jason has come over, or if I've wanted to go somewhere, I've asked permission and every time he has said yes. If he ever had a problem with it he could have said no, so I don't see how I am being selfish if I am asking permission, and while I know I have had lots to do with friends recently, it's spring break, it's the only time I'm going to be able to do that sort of thing until summer.      Anyways, I was sent to bed without being able to talk at around midnight so I didn't have access to the computer to write my blog, which is why I am writing it Sunday after church. Being midnight, and being spring break, I was none what so ever tired, and even if I was, I was in a bad mood so I wouldn't be able to sleep. I instead proceded to clean my room to the fullest it has ever been. I actually pulled out all the crap in my closet, including the ancient toy box with really old toys, and bagged up stuffed animals for Goodwill, vacuumed the floor, and put everything back in a nice new order. The room I got from pulling out the toy box I used to house some Beanie Babies from under my bed which we can't just give away, and some of my shoes, which I really have too many of. I then had lots of new room under my bed but didn't have anything to put under there so I just organized it a bit and left it how it was. This all took me quite some time, and I wasn't completely finished, but I was tired, had church to wake up for church at 9:15, and I had more or less forgotten about my bad mood so I went to sleep at about 2:30.

         I woke up around noon (yay) and ate some breakfast and got on the computer to check the usual email and fantasy sports. Nothing really new. Jason made a really stupid trade with Lee... I think Jason is trying to lose... He must be. Afterwards I talked to Caleb and eventually went to his house after I got in trouble with my mom because I didn't move this pile of dirt/tree bark. I started to move it yesterday but didn't finish because it started to rain. It was raining today so I didn't feel like doing work outside and aparently that wasn't cool with my mom. If she wants me to do something why doesn't she tell me? Make too much sense? Anyway, I moved the darned thing in the rain and then drove myself to Caleb's in my super Cutlass. We went to Sentry and bought some food for chili dogs and rented Undercover Brother. Funny movie. Andy stopped by for a while to watch the movie and eat a few of the hotdogs. It was also yet another reminder that I am useless because I can't play guitar. Afterwards Caleb and I played some epic battles of NBA Live 2004 in which I completely dominated, thanks to some fishy computer playing... which didn't effect me in 4 games. Trust me, don't bring it into Scott Pollard or Raef Lefrentz's house. It's not gonna happen. Following that we watched some TV and looked at some  urlLink Hotornot.com  where Caleb posted himself. And some  urlLink stupidvideos.com . Farting Preacher rules all. And now I have to go to sleep.

             I woke up at Caleb's house at about noon to him demanding that I play another round of NBA Live 2004, as I trounced him multiple times the night before. Unfortunatly, I must admit that in our first matchup he (New Jersey Nets) beat me (Portland Trailblazers) mostly because Damon Freakin Stoudamire couldn't make even the most wide open of threes and Derek Anderson couldn't even bring it across half court with Jason Kidd hacking him the whole way. So I think I lost by about 15. Then we played again and I (Seattle Supersonics) beat up on mainly with Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis, even though he was the Sacramento Kings. Then he demanded another rematch and this time I was the Atlanta Hawks and he was the Miami Heat. Jason Terry kicked his ass. That's all I have to say about that. more than 50 points, and he got Miami's two point guards (Dwane Wade and Rafer Alston) to foul out. Wade in the second quarter.      After that we played some addictinggames.com and then I went home for a few hours before I went to an open gym. It wasn't very much fun because I was on JT's team the whole time and he decided he wanted to play point guard and never pass it to anyone. Wilson got kicked out of the gym for saying something I didn't hear that was offensive. I did get to see Kyle Hamlin play and rip up Jason. I'm just glad it wasn't me. I held Braxton to only a few points. The few times he scored was because I was playing help side on someone else and he was wide open or on a fast break.      Caleb buckled his knee from a high Braxton pass. He was wide open and tried to jump stop while in the air or something and... well, he died. He died. It was like something from Real TV. At the time it looked kind of funny because he got rejected by the backboard and then the ball hit him on the head and rolled out of bounds as he collapsed. So we took a timeout to heal him up and he left early. He's fine now though. Note to self: Kyle Hamlin is really good. Avoid guarding him because I will look stupid if he ever makes a shot, no matter how crazy or godly it may seem. Plus "shutting him down" will require the utmost of energy and I don't like to get tired during open gym.      After open gym Jason came over and we played some Soul Caliber and we got on the computer and watched the Farting Preacher on Stupidvideos.com. Then I did this infernal weblog and I will probably go to sleep sometime soon.

         My day unfortunatly started in the wee hours of the morning (9 AM, come on, it's spring break) in which my supreme ultra-human strength was needed to pick up some heavy dressers across town for my mom's bedroom. Luckily, I was rewarded with three Sausage McMuffins With Eggs at McDonalds. I never knew Bonnie Everill worked there until this morning. I also came across my friend/enemy Wilson Baker. We had a good chat about basketball and such and then he left me and my step dad Lance to our breakfast. You know, it's quite unfair that Wilson is driving an almost new Dodge Ram truck and I am stuck with a 1986 Cutlass Supreme. But alas, such is life. I have a car and that's what matters.      Once we got the dressers home I got comfy in the living room chair and played an hour or so of Soul Caliber 2. I beat it yesterday but now I have to do all these extra missions. I also watched some of our new channels on TV. We just got Dish Network so that's way awesome.      My chores for the day included taking out the garbage three times, cleaning my room (sort of), and moving a roting pile of word ten feet to the left.      I did some fantasy baseball business... mostly just in a post war with some guy from Philidelphia who said he was going to mail me antrax because he didn't like a trade a made with Jason. Unfair, he said it was. What a baby. Caleb responded by calling him an idiot and locking up his team. Rightfully so. My baseball lineup is actually quite the spectacle. I'm quite proud.       After that the rest of my night was basically me being bored, which caused me to play a castle defending game on www.addictinggames.com and starting up this blog. Then I talked to my good friends Erin Labasan and Lee Deaton before heading off to sleep.

          I rule at poker... that's all there is to it.                 Get this: I just had my worst week in months at my recent poker game I host (see previous posts), and I still raked in more cash than anyone else on the table. This time we were without Jason Haun but Lee's brother Brian gave us his company and my wallet money. He is definatly what we in the biz call an elephant, which on one who calls on almost every occasion despite the great odds that they have any hand whatsoever. Lee also cashed in this week... sorta... a lot for him anyway. He made three bucks overall. Very nice work. Glenn lost about eight bucks and Braxton (the cheating bastard) lost about three. It should have been like thirteen though. Brian lost it all and left after an hour or too. I won somewhere around ten, which ended my three straight week streak of twenty five dollar winnings, but I'll take it. It looked to be like another record setting week at first but I lost steam by the end... I was playing a little on tilt, I'm gonna have to work on it.                  Another amazing fact... I got my first real job ever! I started on Saturday at Fuddy Duddy Fudge in Depoe Bay. Braxton hooked me up with the job. It's not that tough, and the perks are great. Free candy whenever I want it... you can't beat that. The number one thing that sucks is making waffle cones... you have no idea how much that sucks. You HAVE to burn yourself, otherwise you don't make them right. Of course, I can't make them anyway... so all I end up doing is burn myself... and that hurts after you do it about twenty times. But basically the job is pretty cool. I've figured out much of the daily process in the shop, all I need to do is master things like coffee making and hot fudge stuff and I'm set.                     Well, that's pretty much it with me. I'm in school right now and slacking off... like always.

          The most exciting thing about today was that my fifth grade girlfriend Samantha (Sam) Aggen came up from California during her spring break to visit we poor Lincoln City folk.     Sam and I had a rather strange relationship all those years ago... I suppose it was just one of those fifth grades things. Regardless, she has been the only girlfriend I've ever had in my entire gosh darn life so it was pretty cool to see her again, albeit for the short time that it was. Hopefully we can go see a movie or something before she has to go back home, which I believe is Saturday or something. I really was happy to see her, but I had to play it cool like an idiot and act like it was no big deal. I'm really quite stupid when it comes to girls, I admit it. I had my reasons of course but none of them are good enough.     Of course, beside seeing Sam, school was as annoying as always. We had a sub in Spanish. After I got home I had to pick up all this tree crap Lance cut down from my old tree house and chuck it over the bank. He needs to stop doing so much yard work. Nobody besides him and MAYBE Mom care about it all. MAYBE Mom. And naturally I have to do any of the work involved in it, Alicia... let's just forget about her.     The new TV we just got for Christmas blew up today and of course it was blamed on me playing Xbox on it. Aparently Xbox isn't good for the dumb TV, even though the stupid thing has the plugins for it, and was thus designed for the Xbox. So anyways, we tried to fix that thing with no success and I have to remember to call the waranty place tomorrow and ask questions. Because of lack of TV and the fact that Alicia was on the internet, I decided to watch Spy Games on the DVD-Rom in my laptop in my room. That's a good movie. I give it 8.5 out of ten. No kidding.        Well, now I'm here typing this thing and I've decided I need to sleep. Au revior.

          I am so damn lazy!            You have no idea how lazy I am! I was so excited to see that I got the Xanga Premium free trial thing and then I don't do anything with it. I don't really have an excuse either. I mean, of course I've been busy and stuff, but if I really wanted to do this thing I would have.         Not much to report on since my last entry. School is still school, unfortunatly. I need a three day weekend or something, bad. I have temporarily recieved a laptop to do some of my HP class work, and I enjoy it a lot. It's so useful to be able to sit against the wall in my room with no wires and type out a report before going to sleep. You have no idea. I've also been in the poker market recently.         I don't know if I've said anything about poker on this site before but I am indeed quite the card fiend. I started hosting a poker night for some friends and I starting a few months ago and it is quite a hit, with me anyway. We even have our regulars and visitors established. The regular attendants are me, Lee Deaton, Jason Haun, Braxton Jackson, and his dad Glenn. We have also had the pleasure of playing with my basketball coach Mike Wagner, Mitchel Spofford, Keenan Clarey, Cody Shiffman, Caleb Linton, my step dad Lance, and Lee's mom Debbie. Anyways, the first few weeks or so I did acceptable to God awful. I broke even 75% of the time and lost it all (ten dollars) one week. After those weeks though I have been on an absolute tear. You see, I did a little reading about poker on the internet, mostly in the areas of the psychological aspects of game and how to figure odds and such while playing. I havn't truly grasped the concept of odds as of yet, but the pschological thing I believe I have down. Evidence of this could certainly be in my three straight weeks of about $25 dollar winnings. I won our first ever tournament held a few weeks ago, $25 dollars there, I won the week after that, $25 dollars there, and last night I won $25 dollars with only three opponents, thanks mainly to Debbie repeatedly buying back in. I was simply on fire. I picked out bluffs, I made a few of my own, folded at the right times, everything. In fact, I believe I only got hit for a big number of chips once or twice the whole night. I started out a little slow, but then I won a few pots in a row and the rest is history.         Anyways... that's prety much it with me. In a few hours I'm going to go to the high school for some open gym. I havn't played basketball in a week or so because of my stupid ankle so I am quite looking foward to it.

                The Longest Email / Blog Entry In The History Of The Universe        I apologize for not updating in so long. If any of you actually know me, you would know that I am one lazy bastard. Anywho, not much has happened recently besides school and the usual basketball practice run by myself for only myself. I have however gotten into quite the shit storm in my HP SIC class. The student running it, Trent Bigelow, is frankly trying to sabotage my perfect 4.0 GPA and I am too damn smart to let that happen. I emailed the longest email in the history of the world to two of my teachers that can make a difference in this matter. I am quite confident I should get what I want. The following is the longest email in the history of the universe, and I don't blame all who die of old age before reaching the end.   Mrs. Fowler and Mr. Gerl,     This is Tyler Popham and I am very concerned with  my grade in the HP SIC class that I have sixth period. First of all, there  shouldn't be a problem at all, but I believe personal issues between Trent and  myself are influencing whatever decision he is making on my grade, which I have  reason to believe could be anything but an A, which would be absolutely wrong.  Keep in mind too that he should not be the person that decides my grade. That's  illegal in fact. The decision should be made entirely by Mr. Gerl.       Favoritism runs rampant in that class, and Trent has turned into a big time  dictator. I believe the reason this whole thing unfortunately has to happen is  because I let it be known that I didn't like the direction the class was going  and had decided not to be in it next year. Caleb and Jake have both made the  same decisions. I just feel that they (Trent, Meaghan, and James) treat people  differently according to what they think of them. I have overheard countless  management meetings where all they do is whine about peoples’ work and how they  should punish them. This immediately caught my attention because as I said  before, it is illegal for one student to determine things like punishment or  grades for another student. I've learned that Trent uses other female students  to talk to the other female students in the class about assignments and such  because he felt it wasn't proper for him to do it himself. Someone who thinks he  has the power to determine someone's grade can't even talk to a student because  she is female? That's not right. Furthermore, I have also overheard that them  (HP SIC management) speaking of assigning two people the same individual  assignment at the same time. One of these people they had a work issue with. At  this point, they hope one person does the assignment so they can bust the other  person. This is a huge waste of time and effort by everyone involved, and all of  it is being done just to make someone feel stupid. They have a hard time  communicating with the students they lead. If they have problems with someone I  rarely see it being brought to that person, but instead talked about without  their knowledge. How are students supposed to fix something if they don't know  there is a problem? All of the talking behind the back and manipulation of  people is sickening in that class. Then there are times when Trent has  overstepped even a teacher's boundaries and flat out yelled at other students  for various things. A few days ago right before my comm. class in Mr. Gerl's  room, Trent came into the room and took my issued HP laptop and backpack, citing  only that we had some major problems. This was all quite loud and in front of my  fellow students. It was quite embarrassing, but I gave him what he needed  without a fuss. I couldn't even care less about losing them. I barely ever used  the laptop, and I have quite a few other backpacks I could have, and have been  using since then. That same day, which I recall as being Monday the 24th, I was  staying after school in the lab and another student that is not in the HP SIC  program (who I know as a Will Something) walked in to look at the computers.  Trent asked him to leave, which is just fine because people who aren’t in the  program aren’t normally allowed in the room. After Will was gone, Trent  proceeded to call him an idiot and yelled at Todd, his own brother, for making  the room seem like a place idiots like Will can be in. Being a friend of Will's  and slightly offended, I asked him not to call Will an idiot, and not knowing  about the restricted access for the lab, challenged Trent's authority on whether  or not he was even allowed to kick people out of a room. I guess this hit a  nerve with him. Nobody likes being seen of as wrong, and I would assume it is no  different for Trent, but he went out of line by yelling at me (witnesses include  Meaghan, Dani, and Lee) and lectured me about not talking about things I don't  know about and very loudly informed me of the restricted access policy. I myself  was shocked at this sudden outburst. After Trent was gone Dani said she couldn't  believe Trent did that to me. Another incident like this happened just today  before all of the HP people came in for the meeting. Lee Deaton showed up late  for whatever reason and Trent seriously blew up on him for not showing up  earlier and not having some work done. He yelled at him, right in front of  everyone in the lab, which happened to be just about everyone in the entire  program, minus of course any instructor. My point is that I have never been in a  class where showing up late, or turning something in late or incomplete has  gotten me yelled at, and it's ridiculous that that sort of thing should be  allowed. TRENT IS NOT A TEACHER, HE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO ACT LIKE ONE. Also,  to this day, Trent has never talked to me about why he took away that stuff from  me in comm. He obviously had/has a problem with me, but doesn't let me know  about it.       With this background information in mind, there are things  you should know about my work for that class. When I entered the class in the  semester, I was given various simple projects. I did all of them and did all of  them well, which in credit to the management, they actually let me know that my  work was appreciated. On good terms at this point, they assigned me bigger  projects, which I was to do all by myself. Such assignments included researching  the current HP ad campaign and coming up with attributes for the perfect CD  burning program. Both of which I was supposed to present in the meetings at  school but didn't get around to it due to time issues. I was however reassured  that my work was excellent and I recall Trent himself at one time calling me his  "shining star" in the class in recognition of my work. Apparently, I was at one  point slated for management next year. I found everything fine and dandy with  this until I started to become aware of all of the problems I spoke of in the  above paragraphs. After enough of this, I eventually lost interest in the class  as far as wanting to be in it next year. I let Meaghan know this recently so as  to not hurt the program by making gaps in it when they need everything up and  running next year. I figured it was a courtesy they deserved. However, since  it's been known that I don't share the common interest, in my opinion, the  management has had it out for me. Caleb will attest for the same thing, as once  it was known he wasn't going to part of the class next year he lost whatever  management status he once had. They try to be very secret about dropping a  person's position in the class, but people like me, Jake and Caleb notice. Not  that academic achievement is exactly relevant here, but notice that all three of  the number one ranked sophomores in the school have decided that the HP SIC is  heading in a direction they don't want to go in, and have bailed.        There are only two assignments, both recent, which I can possibly perceive as  being of poor quality since I have joined up this semester. My Pain Point  assignment (100 things I hate, slightly depressing subject for a teenager, I  think) was turned in a day late because I was currently cluttered with some  other pressing work and I was under the impression it would be OK. Unfortunately  for me, which I admit to, I only had time to come up with 25 out of 100 things I  hated. I was kind of in a tough situation but it was all I could do at the time.  Meaghan and Trent talked to me about it (to my surprise) and gave me the  opportunity to finish it up, which I did, and I am grateful they showed a little  mercy on that one. The other assignment has a long story behind it. It was a  press release assignment, in which I was to come up with a press release like  statement for Lightscribe, which was targeted for a determined market, which had  been decided on as "trend setting thirty year olds." I did this assignment, and  I turned it in on time. A problem with it, which I admit to, I'm not trying to  be shady in any way or form, was that it just plain wasn't very good. I myself  had a hard time coming up with anything to say about Lightscribe that hadn't  already been said. My press release was fairly short but at the time it was the  best I could do. I'm not going to make an excuse, I worked hard on it, but it  wasn't very good and I recognize that. Management and I talked about it again  and they had me redo it, much to my dismay. Like I said, it was not an easy  assignment for me. I did redo it, added a few quotes here and there and made it  longer. It was the best I could do for such an assignment. It might not have  been great but it was all I had. This is where everything gets shady, and I  believe the whole trouble started. My press release project was done, and I had  it on my agenda to send it to Meaghan. She gave me a viral marketing assignment,  which I went to work on that period. Unfortunately, the new assignment took up  all of the class period and all of my attention. I made the human error of  forgetting to send it to Meaghan because of the new work. It's my fault, I  admit. I realized my mistake as soon as I got home for the weekend. The trouble  was that the assignment was on my issued laptop and I had no way to send it to  Meaghan because I could not create an Internet connection at my house because I  did not have the right passwords for the administrative accounts. I tried to  come up with other ways of sending it to her. I asked Lee, which I'm sure he  will attest for, but bottom line was that I was stuck until I got to school on  Monday.        Unfortunately, Monday was when all of the trouble started. It  was the morning when Trent embarrassed me in class and took my stuff away, and  the afternoon when he yelled at me about not knowing what I was talking about.  This was my breaking point. I had been exposed to all of the things I didn't  like about the class, knew Caleb and Jake weren't going to be part of it next  year, but until then, still planned on being in it myself. Afterwards, I  informed Meaghan of my decision. I told her that I would do whatever was needed  of me to finish out the year and I didn't want any hard feelings. She was  understanding with my decision. I have no problem with Meaghan. I like Meaghan  quite a bit in fact. She is understanding and I admire how hard she works for  the program. Problems began when suddenly it seemed I would not get the 'A,'  which I completely believe I deserve. I believe due to Trent's and my own  conflict, he is looking for an excuse to give me something besides an 'A', and  that if I was still slated for management, as I once was, an 'A' would be the  obvious grade. It has become apparent to me that the press release assignment  was my final in the class. I found this out after I turned it in the second  time. It may be just me, but I would imagine that me, a student, not knowing I  was taking a final, shows poor communication on behalf of the program. It is  also not fair that one assignment makes up my final grade. Everyone has  assignments that are tough for him or her. Most people don't get A's on every  single assignment of the year, which is why there are multiple assignments being  considered in the process of determining a student’s final grade. My question is  why are my previous assignments, which HP SIC management told me were definitely  all worth A's, not being accounted for? However bad my press release could have  been, the fact is that I worked hard on it and I shouldn't be getting anything  less than an 'B' considering my effort. With that one single 'B' and all my  other assignments, I don't see how I can get anything but an 'A'. I also want  you to know that there is no real grading system (that at least I know of, and  I'm sure almost nobody else knows of) installed in the class. If there was, this  problem should never have occurred.       Well, this email is pretty darn  long, but I hope you take all of it in account, as I see it all being relevant.  All I want is the grade I deserve, and if I don't get it, I will do whatever I  can to get it. I will talk to Mr. Phelps, the district office, or whoever I need  to, but I know I deserve an 'A' and I won't allow another student to give me  anything else.        I hope we can set up a meeting and talk over all of  this, because it is very important to me.                                                                                 -Tyler Popham       *** Since this entry was archived, I am happy to say that I got an A in that class and still hold a 4.0 GPA. Go me! (Posted August 6th 2004)

      Fellow readers, if the follow seems rash and inappropriate, then it probably is. I just need to write this while I am still caught up in the heat of the moment. It is however, 100% the truth.  My mom, in her dumbness and wish to seem powerful all of a sudden, has decided it appropriate to wake up me, a 4.0 student, someone who works from noon to seven at a tedious tourist appealing job, and all around nice kid, at exactly 9:30 AM... In the summer! Why this travestry you ask? So I can mow the fucking lawn. Err... lawns. "Front and back!" my mom screamed at me. She is picking on me all the time, I swear it. Just because she got married to Lance and has some back up now. Before, if she was doing something really stupid for no reason (happened a lot), I could usually talk her out of it by enticing her with logic. Not anymore. Now she is on a power trip and has me and Alicia doing things just for the hell out it. No joke. The lawn... lawns, didn't even need mowed. The only reason I put up with it is because my basketball camp, which is rather expensive, is tomorrow, and Mom and Lance are stubborn enough to ban me from going, even if it will mean they are out of $380.  The worst part of this story is that when I was getting some gas to fill the stupid mower up with, I fell in a fucking hole and mildly twisted my ankle. It isn't swollen or anything, and I think being careful on it will keep me in action, but the point is that it hurt like hell, and has the potential to limit my playing ability at camp. Oh, did I mention that my goal for an entire year has been to make the All-Star team at this camp?  Anyways, I have to go to work soon, and then I will be off to camp for a week, where hopefully I will be fine. In the meantime, I won't be able to post until atleast Friday night. Hopefully by then my poker chips will have arrived. Tournament planned for Monday. Get on the horn Deaton.

      Does anybody have any original thoughts anymore? I only ask because I realized today that I actually don't - along with the rest of the world. My guess is that over 90% of what people say have already been said by someone else and whoever heard it is just trying to pass it off as his/her original idea. It kind of reminds me of a scene from the movie Good Will Hunting...(as a result, this post is no longer original and I'll stop writing now.)

           Folks, there is tragedy a foot. My good friend Lee Deaton has recently sworn off poker and I am incidentally banned from playing poker with him or his family for the time being. The reason? I am just too damn good.      After winning somewhere around the fifth tournament in a row, and putting my total low stakes poker winnings at approx. $272, Lee called it quits ("I've had enough of this poker bullshit), and his mom must also be tired of losing. This is a severe crisis for me. I was in a severly good mood after last night's poker extravaganza, in which I knocked out every player in the tournament, got quads for the first time ever (they were jacks, and I folded what would have become quad deuces pre-flop) and won a cool $20. The problem with this is that it becomes non-fun for the other players. Vicki, Brian's girlfriend was the first out after she had a full house and went all-in against my quads. She took it sportingly and was our dealer for the rest of the tournament. I knocked Lee out an hour or so later when I forced him all in against my straight and he only held top pair. This pissed the bejesus out of him. He left in a storm, swearing off poker for good, claiming he is a good poker player but the most unluckily person in the world. Brian went probably two hours later when I didn't think I had a straight and he had top pair with an ace kicker. I owned almost all the chips at this point and Debbie was dismissed in about ten minutes when she was forced to call all in due to a blind and I hooked up with a pair of sixes to win it.       It was a little sad to hear about Lee's defection, but I think he will be back. His mom, Debbie, I also think will come to her senses. Besides, I just spent $80 on EBay to buy a set of new clay poker chips in an alluminum case. That simply can't be wasted. Oh yeah, and while I was on EBay, I found this:   You best get bidding Lee...

      Well, here goes my second attempt at a blog. Hopefully this time I pick up some readers (Deaton, I'm talking to you) and find the time to keep it up. Regardless, Blogspot is much much better than that damn Xanga site.  I guess my first entry should be about what I did today. In later posts I will share my views on various political situations, and attempt to give you faithful readers a little insight into the chaos that is my life.  Today I woke up around 9:15, took a shower, and went to work. For future reference, I work at the illustrious Fuddy Duddy Fudge. I am literally a kid in a candy store. Anyways, at work I was performing my normal work duties when my basketball coach, Pat Shoemer, called and asked if I could get off early for a shoot around with a few of the other players. I got some big time flack from my bosses, but I had permission to go. I went to the shoot around shot horribly. It happens I guess. Afterwards, I spent a few hours with Pat talking about basketball over dinner at Kylo's, and we looked into some competetive ping-pong with our friend Butch, but it feel through and I came home. I got bored, so I made up this blog.  That's about it for now. I will keep you all posted on the basektball situation and the rest of the nuinces that are my life.

      Well readers, err... Lee and Jason... it's been a little longer than a month since my first blog entry on Blogspot.com and my blog is a complete and utter failure. I have attracted no new readers, have failed to get into any sort of blog ring, and typed probably around five or so hours to no avail. Still, I will continue to waste my time with this blog, simply because it gives me some sort of satisfaction, and because I still cling to a hope that I will get a comment from someone I don't know. Progress is enticing. This blog can only improve, and will do so with each and every post I make. In the mean time, let's look back on the wonderful posts of the past in which I have made.  Ah, the first post. Pure gold. English at its best.  The second and third posts of this blog were made to express the commedic side of my personality. I love humor. Genius posts, no?  Ah, the poker crisis post. How I remember those tragic times. Scared for my life I was. Actually, I am in quite another poker crisis that may be worse than that one, but I will save the story for my next post.  The original post was actually not original. I stole it from another blog while I was browsing. Damn I'm clever. (Bwahahaha!)  The last few posts I've made have concerned the recent happenings of my life, and the way this blog is evolving, most posts will be something of that kind of nature. I find that I simply lack the time to make other types of entries.  Oh dear, I've had some good times with this blog. Staying up late typing while enraged with my parents is extremely soothing. Hopefully I can attract some readers and some feedback for some encouragment to keep typing. My current goal for this blog is to reach 100 posts, but I know I can't get there without more readers. Lee, we must get into a blog ring. Oh yes, and Lee, I commend you on finally making an entry. Make it more of a habbit. Bitch.

      Poker is bad to me, and I don't deserve it. I've studied up, I play right, I make the right reads. It doesn't pay off. Well, not recently anyway. I have a short term memory though. If I'm on a bad run I can forget about anything that happened, even if it was a few days ago. Tonight's poker night was probably the hardest on me of any recent night. The kind of poker we play now used to psych me out a little, because of the stakes involved. A dollar bet used to send shivers down my spine. Back then I played way too tight against big bets (Dollar to me? Fuck, I'm out with top pair and good kicker...) and way too loose with my starting hands (Face card... Interesting...). I liked the game though, and I did my homework. I've gone to the library and gotten myself some fine poker literature and even an awesome film on tells, the latter of which has yet to help me. I am actually up about $280 over the entire six months or so since poker night has been established. But for the last week or two I haven't had anything what so ever. I was on a three tourny skid, and then two days ago I broke it with a small hold'em victory against Lee, Bryin, and Lance. That same night it seemed some of my luck returned when I kicked Lee's ass at blackjack. We were only playing for two dollars, but he knew a point system for counting cards and all, so I was quite sure I was dead money. After he had me by a few bucks in chips though, he had a monumental run of bad cards to go up against my dealer hands. A bad run of cards that can only be bested by something I am going to talk about later in this post. He had twelve against an up face card with a high count more than anyone in a half hour period has ever had. Ever. After that, or maybe before, I don't remember, but sometime that night, we played "go fish" for fun. I don't think anybody could have done worse than Lee than round either. I think I had like 23 pairs to his three. That's a horrendous beating. I mean, even if you don't know how to play you can get lucky and draw a pair or two every once in a while. Well, Lee just died that game. That's pretty much all there is to it. He made up for it though. Following our card activities, we played some late night Soul Caliber 2 on my nifty XBox, and Lee proceeded to kick my ass something like eleven times to my three wins at most. It was pretty intense actually. Neither one of us got blown out in any of the rounds. I think once he got me with like three guys still alive, but I also had him in the same situation a few times, and he tragically came back to beat me by one. He had me ten to zero before I won the first time, which did using random characters and somehow beating him even though I got some of the guys I play worst with. The next night I drove over to Lee's house and we played again. This time the tables were turned. I had him at like three games to zero and he decided to quit Soul Caliber 2 for MVP Baseball 2004, another awesome title owned by your's truly. I pride myself on an excellent XBox and Nintendo 64 game collection, despite my somewhat limited funds. Lee is an extremely bad sport I've discovered. I mean, I know that nobody likes to lose, but this kid is a fucking psycho when it comes to it. The main thing that bothers me about his bad attitude when losing though, is that he never admits defeat. There is always something that went wrong, which will be the reason he lost. In poker, when somebody draws out a hand to beat him, something he lets happen to many times (he has been getting better at betting his hand and betting to protect his hand, but actually many times somebody, me or Bryin 99% of the time, makes an expensive bad call and gets lucky on the river, something which isn't Lee's fault) you will never hear the end of it. Calm the fuck down Lee. Seriously, it bugs the shit out me, and your mom, and your brother, and fucking everybody else who plays. You never lose  your  money anyway. Give it a break, nobody wants to hear you bitch. I think your problem is that you are used to only playing games you win at, such as the Battlefield series, or pretty much any other computer game you play a lot. Screw that though, somebody better be atleast one of the top thousand players in the world if they devote hour upon hour, day after day after day playing it like you do. I get really fucking good at video games I play a lot. I bet if I played any game you play as much as you I would be better than you at it. Ask Jason how good I am some certain video games sometime. Like Super Smash Brothers, or Mario Cart 64, or Halo (you know about Halo, or you should anyway, I kicked your ass last night). I own most people at anything I devote a lot of my time too. Basketball too. Basketball frustrates the hell out me sometimes though, because many many times I know I am better than someone, or know that I have worked harder on my game than they have, and that I am an all around better basketball player than they are, but they still are better than me because they are bigger than me or something like that. I don't care what anybody says, but I think I am better than the current Val-Co League Player of the Year, J.T. Gilmore, but he is way to fucking huge for anybody to stop, and that is the only reason he is any good at all. His post up moves are really good, and is jumper is a very nice addition to his game also, I'll give him those atleast. But how hard is it when you're that huge anyway to go coast to coast without having to worry about getting stripped or somebody moving in to take a charge from you? I would wager a lot of my money to say that I have spent so many more hours in the gym than him, despite the fact that I have only been playing basketball since middle school. But he is still better on the court than me. Like I said, I think I'm better, and know what to do better, I just can't compete with something like size. Wow I got off the subject. I was talking about Lee being a bad sport I think, well, I pretty mucked summed that one up. Back to poker, which was supposed to be my only topic in the first place. I just get side tracked and my fingers just fly on the keyboard... They have a mind of their own sometimes... It also helps that I don't want to go to sleep and there is nothing on TV this late. Poker though. Goodness. Tonight: horrible. I went out of my way for this one. I took an hour off my practice tonight (and got another fucking guilt trip from Pat. I told him I was going shopping. I lied because he makes me feel bad for having a life. It pisses me off so much. He is getting all over Jason too, and that's not cool. Jason is busy, that's all there is to it. Pat is a horrible motivator, considering the fact that we are playing summer league basketball and everything we are doing is technically "optional," unless of course you want to start. You're fucked if you don't show up and want to start.) so I could eat and get set up for poker. It was supposed to be a bigger night than it actually was. Braxton, Glenn, and Cushman wussed out on us. Anyways, I was completely ready for a winning session. I had Subway and everything! We started up around 8:30 and it was immediately looking good for me. I knocked out a few people and had myself quite the chip, and I did a good job of keeping it too. I was catching cards like you wouldn't believe for the first few trips around the table. I had a pocket pair, an ace, or a couple of face cards every single hand in that first stint there. They all hit on the board too, or if they didn't were never bested by anybody else. I was up to nearly fifty dollars from ten, and in chip lead by a lot. Quite formidable. But with the best run of cards can come the worst run. THE worst run. Worse than Lee's run a few nights ago. This is the run I talked about at the beginning of the post. Wow, I typed that a long time ago. Probably atleast an hour ago. This is one long ass post. Anyways, it was a bad run. No face cards, unless it was like J-2 offsuit or something, no aces, no pocket pairs, no suited connectors. Just a whole shit load of 3-8's or 2-9's. I would get suited cards every once in a while, a lot actually but I figured if I ever got myself a flush draw I would miss it or if I actually got a flush, somebody else would get one and have a better card than my nine or something. As it is, almost no hand I folded pre-flop would have accounted for anything at all. I was playing really smart poker in fact. I was protective of my lead, and didn't do anything stupid at all. I rarely do. I am never in the hand on the river with money in the pot when I don't have anything. I'm crafty like that. Patient. Anyway, everybody was losing, and I was up a whole shit load, and people wanted to buy back in. I may have been vain in thinking "whatever, I am just going to win it all anyway, with my massive chip lead and all," but I'm good at poker, and it looked to be my week, so I'm allowed thoughts like that. I don't care about the money that much anyway. I just like playing. On the same night I don't like losing, probably just as much as Lee, I just don't freak out when I do lose like him though. This week was a little bit different though. First place, due to all the re-buys and such, was going to get something like seventy dollars. That's something I want to get, so I was playing some damn good poker all night long in hopes of getting it. Anyways, the good run came, followed by the bad run, and one horrible thing happened. Mitchell was dealing and he accidently flipped Bryin's first card over. It was a nine, I remember. It just got caught on the wind or something, but more likely Mitchell was being a jackass and was just dealing way too fast because he thinks he's cool or something. Anyway, a re-deal was called for. Standard procedure. Except for the fact that Mitchell kept dealing the cards, just to see what would have happened. Wouldn't you know it? Pocket aces for me! And then an ace for Lee and Mitchell. They had face card kickers too if I remember right. All good hands. Flop came something that I don't remember, same with the turn and the river. Whatever the hand was, everybody had something pretty darn good, the blinds were high, I was in big blind for two dollars, and my aces would have been good. That pot probably would have been good for fifteen dollars or so. A pot I desperately needed to get myself out of the losing mode and a pot I needed just for the money. That pissed me off a lot. I think on the re-deal I got raped with something like a 7-3 offsuit and then a shit flop. Bye bye two dollars! Anyway, despite the bad run, and the high blinds, I'm a good player, and I was able to keep myself above thirty dollars that whole time. I was in a solid second. Lee was at about twenty, Mitchell was at ten constantly because he kept losing and buying back in, and Bryin had past me with his reckless and lucky play and had my by like two bucks. I had played everything right. Then came what I can only refer to now as "the hand." I get pocket fives. A very nice hand to see after all the shit I'd seen for the past few hours. I am in big blind though, up against only Bryin, who is reckless as hell and I didn't want to have to think about an all-in if Bryin re-raised me with something like K-3, something he would definitely do, even though he is in chip lead. He is reckless as hell, and the thing is too that he would get the cards to win too. Lucky bastard. Anyway, it was only a pair of fives, and the flop and I hadn't been on good terms in a while, so I checked the big blind to see where I was at. Flop comes A-A-2. I can tell Bryin doesn't have an ace. That much I'm sure of. I can usually put people on cards, and I can usually figure out where I am in the hand by when and where people put their bets in. I bet something like two dollars. Bryin moans, a good sign because he never puts on a show when he is ahead in the hand, and calls anyway, just to see cards. Reckless as hell. The turn comes ace. I have an off the board full house. Cha ching. I have to make a big bet to protect my hand here. I bet ten dollars. Bryin calls slowly. He is weary, I can tell. He thinks I have the quad aces or better than whatever he has. I personally put him on two unpaired over cards waiting for something to come up. He called anyway and the river was a four. I was in excellent shape at this point. I had an off the board full house, my opponent was already fucked big time with lots of money in the pot he couldn't just let go, and no high cards came up for him to pair on that could have beaten my fives. All-in. It was the one time I said it all night. Bryin thought about it for a few minutes, and called me. "Do you have a pocket pair?" I asked. "Because that's the only way I'm going to lose." He flipped over pocket sixes. Everybody erupted. Fuck, fuck, fuck! Sixes beat fives.... That is absolute garbage. He couldn't have had sixes... He played them un-Bryin like. I didn't understand. He doesn't have moves, he gets lucky. This was a very bad lucky too. I say "all-in" once when I look so very golden and it bites me in the ass. It was the bad beat from hell. If I was in a casino, I would have gotten consolation money for that shit. Horrible. Once again the best player in the room goes down. I was a little shaken, which is understandable. Anybody who is any good at poker has to be upset with something like that, especially considering how well I had played on the night. Poker took a brief intermission while Bryin gave me a ride home. I got my entrance fee back atleast. I had to remind everybody that I was the only player still in the tourny who hadn't bought back in and technically should have already won everything. It was good enough for ten dollars atleast. I probably could have gotten five or ten more for my trouble and for the bad beat, but I wasn't trying to cheat anybody, I was just pissed about the hand and people felt sorry for me. As well they should be. No hard feelings on Bryin. That was a bad hand and there was nothing I could do about it, I just am really disgusted on how it turned out. I knocked Bryin out earlier in the night too. Fuck buying back in. I'm not playing that way anymore, it's too cheap. Bryin actually got a little revenge on that hand too though, because earlier in the night during my bad run of cards he went on all-in in front of me and I had pocket fives (again). I was thinking about calling and Lee showed me his folded hand. 4-5. Made my decision easy. Fold. Lee couldn't have known I was on something like pocket fives, and he influenced the hand a lot, but he meant well. As it is though, Bryin was way way pissed. We flipped the rest of the cards to see what would have happened and he would have won that hand. I probably wouldn't have called his all-in anyway, but it could have cost Bryin fifteen dollars. He was understandably upset. Lee got bitched out for that big time. Vegas would have shot him, so it could have been much worse I guess. Back on topic, Bryin gave me a ride home and I've been on the computer this whole time typing what could be the longest blog entry ever. It's taken me about two hours of non-stop typing for all of this. I've done a little chatting but that's it. Lee got home and informed me that Mitchell eventually ended up winning. I have a huge problem with that. He bought back in three times and ends up winning it all. Very very gay. I guess Bryin pissed his money away after he resumed play. I swear, he never plays badly when I am against him. Lee got third on a bad beat too I guess, but I don't care what anybody says, nothing is going to be worse than "the hand" for a long long time. Oh well, I think I have run out of things to type. Finally. If I don't get some comments after typing this novel...

      Sometimes I wish I was one of the typical Lincoln City pot heads. I often wonder if I would atleast have more fun if I were. As it is, I am basically the story book goody two shoes white kid, who is too shy to get a girlfriend, has to be home for dinner, and likes video games too much. I just want a new image. Its always been one of my dreams to go to a new school where nobody knows me and start over how I want to. I also have a whole shit load of family problems. It's kind of a reflexive property sort of thing though. Reflexive property is something like 1=1. The family problem is the problem. None of them are big things, atleast to me. To Mom and Lance though, oh my God, you would have thought I killed someone. For instance, dishes that are left out accidently (and rarely by me) get me near grounded or at the very least yelled at. Sleeping in during the summer (God forbid!) always gets me prevented from going to play poker or hanging out at a friends house. Because I'm wasting the day or something. Well in case you don't know, I'm a 4.0 student and I work 5 days a week in the summer, along with having an insane basketball coach who makes us have three hour practices every single day, which I go to as soon as I get off from work and stay until about 8:30. I need sleep quite badly. I also get in trouble a lot for my "attitude," because I have gotten the thought in my mind that I am smarter than Mom and Lance, and just because the parent figure says something doesn't mean it's right. It's little things (don't let them know I am calling them little) that get me nailed. Like dishes, or back talking (I'm a teenager and I'm smarter than my parents, it's almost no fair) or getting home at 12:09 when I said 12:00. Those kind of things go on my honor as a man, or so says Lance. Fuck honor OK? I don't care anymore. I got yelled at for accidnetly connecting to the internet while Lance was on the phone tonight. He had to make a big scene about me not caring about anyone but myself and couldn't just go back to talking to whoever he was talking to. On top of that he told me I have to pay for a new mouse because the old one got broke when Bobby made me spill milk on it. It is like the first time I have ever spilled near the computer and now we can't have food when we are using it. He only uses the stupid computer for a stupid flash golf, and it's a huge deal when he can't play now because the mouse is messed up. I need to stop buying XBOX games and save up for a new computer, this piece of crap is driving me crazy. Sometimes I wish I was one of the Lincoln City pot heads. I would probably have more fun than I do now, what with getting nailed for stupid shit. Maybe if I was into drugs, or alcohol, or sex, or violence, my parents would just realize that they were lucky to have a good kid like me and take it easy every now and then when I make a mistake. I havn't gotten where I am today with their help. They buy me things but they don't exactly support me if you know what I mean. I'm dying in this family. I'm suffocating...

      First off, I apologize for the long time in between posts. Unfortunatly, I am quite busy this summer and/or just too tired to write anything when I do have the time. Updating on my most recent post, I went to basketball camp and finally made that God forsaken All-Star team, despite the ankle situation. I was drafted fairly late to the UCLA Bruins on the first day but by the end of the week it was clear I was one of the top players at camp. The Bruins had three all-stars on the roster, including me and two Wilsonville players, both of whom were at camp last year. I actually think it's quite strange what camp did to my game this year. Pre-camp, I was mostly a driving/off the dribble player. While that was still effective, for some reason I was just feeling it from downtown all week, and I shot an extremely high percentage from three, and I suspect made the most threes in the five on five games, despite was Jason says. Jason made the all-star team also, and it was extremely fun playing agaisnt the Big-Ten all-stars and the coaches. In the coach game, I had 13 points and a few assists. I had three three pointers and a drive in extremely tall traffic, I was quite happy with my performance. My only conclusion is that it had to be the headband I was wearing. I think the funnest part of camp had to be on the last day when my team and Jason's team met in the Pac-10 championship. Jason and I guarded each other, so there was extra pride on the line. Jason apparently "shut me down," despite the fact that I had ten points. I shut him down too. He had zero. Anyway, despite the fact that we had a large lead on them in the begining, the idiots that are on my team like fouling a lot, and camp has some weird rules on fouls, such as its an automatic point and they get the ball back. We probably fouled them for somewhere near ten points, enough for Jason's team to end up beating us by one in the final minute. There was a last second shot drawn up for me but our all-star center couldn't even inbound me the ball. Oh well.  That's about it for camp. I came home and worked the next few days. It is officially summer at Fuddy Duddy Fudge, and it was quite busy almost all of the time. I've played poker a few times since I've been home also. I won the first tournament we played but I've lost the last two times, ending my winning streak. While I don't expect myself to come in first EVERY time I play, it still disappoints me to lose. It's OK though, because when I did lose I was employing a few stradegies and moves so I think by the next time we play I should have them down and back in my winning ways.  The most important thing of all happened yesterday though. At approxametely 11:30 AM, Thursday July 8th, 2004, I Tyler Popham, GOT MY LICENSE!!! It is so nice not to need a ride all the time. I can just drive myself to poker games, or XBOX fests at Lee's house, without having to aggravate parents for rides and such. I can also get myself to work, which is very important because despite the fact that they were nagging me for months to get a job, my parents would get pissed every time I needed a ride. Hipocrites, I say.  Well, that about sums up the last week or two for me. It's been highly exciting and I'm thinking up some more posts, so I'll have updates whenver I find the time to write them.

            With Farduan's comment in my entry lovingly titled "What the Hell," my blog has officially got the first comment from a non-regular reader (non-regular being anybody but Jason and Lee) ever. I suspect it is because Lee finally took my advice and put up on advertisement for our blogs on a message board on GameFaqs.com. Very exciting. Hopefully whatever readers we pick up will stick with us. It gives me reason to keep writing anyway. Also, if you have come across this blog because of the advertismen, please leave a comment letting me know about it. It's nice to see results once in a while. Thanks.

      Check out the new entries I put in before my first entry on Blogspot.com. They are from my previous blog on the inferior Xanga.com, but I don't want to lose what I have written so I decided to stash them away where I will be able to get to them easier. Not to mention the fact that I will forget how to get to that website before too much longer. Anways, they are oldies but goodies. Each entry from Xanga will be titled Archived from Xanga, in case of any confusion.

      Every now and then, I like to look at random people's blogs, just to see if they have any interesting ideas or entertaining material. Every once in while I find a blog or entry that is so bad, I have to share it with my faithful readers... err... Lee. I believe I am actually less intelligent after having read the following:   "I found there is mold in the bathroom. When I got to the apartment, there was no mold. I think that a lot of rains in these days caused mold. The wall between tiles got moldy.  I turned my back to the window so as not to wake up by sunshine in the morning. Then I noticed something was on the mirror door of our closet. I was wondering what is there. It was a door knob."   *Shudder*

      I was gone a week up in Spokane, Washington for two basketball tournaments. The first tournament was actually held about fifteen minutes out of Spokane in the town of Medical Lake. It took about eight hours of non-stop car riding to get there. I slept most of the way up, so it didn't seem  that  long, but it was definatly no hop to Price 'N Pride. When we would stop at rest areas or fast food places, Pat would get extremely pissed because stupid Edi, Zach, Shane, and Danny would go off and smoke ciggaretts. It is only summer league, and we were hundreds of miles away from home, so Pat can't exactly kick them off the team or anything. Instead, Pat gave us an hour long lecture about responsibility and taking advantage of oppurtunities. We probably spanned more than one hundred miles before he was finished talking. Very boring. When we finally got to Medical Lake, and stepped out of the car, we all nearly died. It was hot. Way hot. Like 115 degrees hot, not to mention that we had been in the car forever and our legs were dead. We were staying in a Best Western at the edge of town. Pat, Butch, Che, and I were sharing a room. In the room next to us were Edi, Zach, Shane and Danny, and down the hall were Andy, Justin, Sean, and Ron, except for Ron bought his own room after we got there. Anyways, I think we competed in the Medical Lake tournament for three days. We got dead last. At one point, we were playing like the second best team in the tournament. That was very encouraging because we were lacking JT, who was going to meet us in Spokane via train after the Medical Lake tourny. He was busy or something. Anyway, we were doing good in the tourny and then everything fell apart. We lost to Hockinson, a team that isn't that good but has a lot of potential. Pat used to be an assistant at Hockinson before he got the head coaching job at Taft. Incidentally we hang out with lots of the Hockinson guys and games between us are always really fun. The last time we played them was at the Hockinson tourny in Hockinson a week or two ago. We won that. Anyways, after we lost to Hockinson, we lost to a lot of other teams too. Some teams good, some teams bad. A really good team was Medical Lake. They had this one black guy that was like 6'4, had cornrows, and was aparently being recruited to a Divison I school. He missed a dunk on us. Just the fact that he was in the position to dunk on us shows how good the team was. They slaugtered us big time. Andy sprained his ankle in that game and so we didn't have a ball handler for the rest of the game and after that we were just fucked. They would get a rebound and just chuck it down court to a cherry picker every time. We also lost to Moscow by a lot. We are sworn never to speak about that game either. We were just cold as ice and they couldn't miss anything at all. They were a very mechanical and fundamental team, where as we are a lot of skill and finess. When we got in the tourny we lost a really close game to Lake Washington. It was way physical. I am seeing right away that I am going to become a lot tougher player through playing with my team. Bodies flying everywhere. Punches are thrown, Andy got pegged in the balls by some other guy, there was a lot of technicals, and after the game Andy and the kid that pegged him almost got into a fight, and it got broke up and some lady said something to Andy and he called her a bitch. Incidentally it was the other team's coach's wife and he wouldn't let Pat apologize to him after all the scuffles. Pat didn't really care though, he is so laid back about stuff like that. After that crazy ass game, we lost to the shittiest team in the world. They were so shitty I don't even remember their name. We got eighth place out of eight teams. We got a really nice trophey but Pat broke it because he was pissed about doing so bad. I kept the bottom. It looks kind of nice, I might glue so gold guy on top or something. I'm crazy like that. The highlight of the tourny was that we got a cool shirt. Umm... yeah, it was that bad. I played like shit too. Well, what I have to come to deal with now is that I don't have to score as much as I did on JV for our team to be doing well. I was like, the only guy on JV, and I was getting like twenty points per game, but in varsity I am surrounded by a lot of other capable players for once, and I am not the go to guy. I got around five points per game, but they were all good shots and in the flow of the offense. That's all that can't really be asked of me at this point, because JT, Andy, and Sean are running the show. Me and Justin are the designated post feeders and three point specialists. Kind of a cool job I think. Anyways, we went up to Gonzaga, reunited with JT, and commenced to mow down the other teams. The only games we lost were really close and we left it all on the floor. I was our team representative for the three point contest but I only got four in a minute. Horrific. Chris Turre from Newport won the whole thing. I'll have to watch out for him this season. After all of our games at night we all watched the Gonzaga players scrimmage. They are so unbelievably good. Blake Stepp, an NBA rookie and Gonzaga alumni, was scrimmaging too. He was hitting threes at will until he stepped back to NBA range. I could tell what he was working on. Turiaf was there too, only he didn't play at night because he had a foot injury. It was minor but he is the super star of the team so they don't want to risk anything. I planned on getting his autograph but never did. I said "what's up" to him by the elevator though. He was on his bike and he said "what's up" back. I felt so cool. One team that is freaking awesome is White Swan. They are out of Seattle and they are an all Native American team off of a reservation. They press all game and are all like little Allen Iversons out there. Crazy handles and quick little bastards that shoot the lights out. We almost beat them the first time we played them. It was an awesome game. I've never felt better after a loss because we learned so much from playing them and we got a lot better. We played them again the next day but they beat us again by a larger margin. At that point, fatigue had set in big time. We had been up in Washington for about a week, playing three games a day, everyday, and we were all injured and tired as hell. We went into the tournament and lost in the second round to the Decator Gators. It was all good though because we were all tired and wanted to go home. We packed up and were gone in an hour. Another eight hours back home. This time I didn't sleep so it seemed much much longer. We had been driving forever, and we were finally in Salem. Home stretch, or so it seemed. At a red light, the CD player died and all our lights went out. When Butch went for the gas the car died. Right in the middle of the road in Salem. We all got out really quick and started pushing the car through the fast moving traffic to a gas station where we got a jump. The car started up again and we were on our way but we only got about one hundred yards before it died again. This time we pushed it to a car repair place. We discovered that the alternator was dead and we were fucked because there was no way to get one that late at night. We ended up calling Justin's parents to come pick us up from Lincoln City. While we were waiting, the car guy showed us his car collection. In this back, private room, he had an tricked out '79 Mustang for racing, a Subaru racing car, and a 2000 Dodge Viper. Very impressive stuff. After the car guy left and we were on the sidewalk waiting, Butch and I played the African Black Magic game and impressed everybody. That game is so cool. When Justin's parents finally got there, we set off for home. about ten miles out of Salem, cop cars zoomed past us and a mile down the road we got stopped in a traffic jam because there was a huge accident. While we were sitting there waiting, four firetrucks and a lot more cop cars went by us to the scene. We would never get home it seemed. We turned around and went back to Salem and got home through the longer McMinville route. I got home at one o'clock in the morning and went straight to bed. Since then, I have been resting and working. I got a new CD from Lee today and did some sand sprints late tonight. That's about it... oh wait, I joined some more fantasy football leagues. That's about it... seriously.
