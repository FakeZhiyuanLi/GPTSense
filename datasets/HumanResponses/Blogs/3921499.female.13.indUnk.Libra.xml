       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Today i finally saw rhonda after like 2 months.. but she had to babysit till 6pm. so we sat there with this 5 year old who was really cute but pushy. she had a really big attitude problem and it was kinda annoying. So we played barbies and "talked" all day. then her HOTT father came to pick her up. So we went swimming. but rhonda's moms friends were over and they were freaking us out cuz they kept looking at us. so then rhonda looked at them and caught them being bad (cough cough) i hope u get it cuz i dont wanna say it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hgkj*P    oT*jsfhs&nbsp;&nbsp; so yeah.&nbsp; so we got out and went to go get some ice cream. it was good. we went back to rhondas house and i had to leave so&nbsp;we both&nbsp;left. then&nbsp;we got home and we went online and for some reason she wanted to talk to alex but i told her no. and then i let her read the thing alex sed about" how no one cared about jenny krystine and sam because they were in their own little world"..&nbsp;so i had to tell her the story.&nbsp; about 10 minutes later rhonda saw a pic of me and krystine and she was like" hey i wanna hang out wth krystine one day" and i sed "o well her b day is comming up" and&nbsp;rhonda sed "oh how come she didnt invite me?" and i sed i dont kno. so i called her and asked if rhonda can go to the mall&nbsp;with us on her b day and a whole bunch of stuff happened.&nbsp;i got a fone all from krystine saying" hey im mad at you, bye"&nbsp; so i was like .. ok?&nbsp; and then sam told me that krystine dont want me to go to the party. so i started crying saying its not fair how krystine is always mad at me for something stupid(and a lot more things) so my mother came in and was&nbsp; like WHATS A MATTER? and she got all mad and i got all mad so she grabbed the fone hung it up and i took my remote threw it on the floor, it bloke in like 80 pieces.. so my mom took the remaining and threw it in my eye.. so i kicked her(literally) out of my room.. and yeah. i did bad things.&nbsp; -----im done now! :)&nbsp;      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xjennyo

        &nbsp;I havent written in like 3 days so im gonna tell you about all those days. I only remember friday and saturday .. so on friday, me and krystine were all excited cuz we were gonna go to the movies. AND krystine would get some action..lol. ne way, we were trying to get a hold of gabe for like 2 hours.. so then we finally got a hold of his brother ryan.. and he told us that gabe was either at pats or the movies.. so were like "ok now we cant go see spiderman2 with gabe" (since he already seen it that same day) so then we tried calling again later that day and his mom answered and was like "hes at the movies" (again) so this time me and krystine were freaking out cuz we thought he had went to the one showtime we were gonna go to(cuz that was the plan) the showtime had started at 7:00 . and now it was 7:15, so we got a ride to marcus and&nbsp; ran to the theater that we were supposed to go to.. but it was all dark so we couldnt see. so then a security guy came up to us and was like "lettme see your tickets" so i gave him my ticket and i felt like saying BOOYA! but obviously i didnt. so we checked the other 2 theaters but he want there. so we bought the tickets but never went to go see the movie.. so we were calling gabe on the payfone( like 80 times) but no one answered and we didnt have pats #. so we decided to call krystines dad and her dad was liek "GABE CALLED" AND WE WERE SOOO PISSED.&nbsp; ---- so on saturday we went to pats house to have lunch for some reason. (his mom invited us)&nbsp; his house is sooo crappy.. i wanted to leave so bad.. but krystine wanted to make out with gabe so i was like, ok ill stay. (in my head) nuthing really happened but i was afraid to eat the pizza cuz it looked weird but i did anyway.&nbsp; so we all walked to krystines house and krystien and gabe finally made out and it was cute but then she bit his lip or something and it kinda looked like they were tripping over eachothers feet or something.. lol. so they left and we went to see mean girls for like the 3rd time. we only stayed for the beginning and middle.. then we got bored so we left. so then i stayed the nite over there and we were making little home vidoes of us on her digital camera.. it was fun cuz i went all crazy and then we got her kicking me in the " u kno what" and i was the one filming so it was really cool. BUT THEN WE ACCIDENTALLY DELETED IT! so that suked.so yeah i had fun.!!!

       Today i spent the nite at sams house. when i go there, we went on habbo.. we probably stayed on habbo for like 5 hours.. (i know... soooo much fun!) then we ate dinner, and i think went back on habbo again. But the worst part was when me and sam met this guy on habbo.. and hes like " wanna see my webcam?" and were&nbsp;like&nbsp;"Sure!" and so we tried to get it but it didnt work so he ended up giving us a picture of him... HE&nbsp;WAS SOOOO UGLY. it was soo GROSS!&nbsp;it was so hard to look at him.. and/or&nbsp; even speak to him! so me and sam lied to him about actually seeing the pic. we told him that it was a blank screen w/ a box on it (with no picture)&nbsp; i dont think he believed it but w.e.&nbsp;but in the middle of all this krystine imed sam.. and this was&nbsp;when we were trying to get the picture.. so me and sam were all excited and stuff...&nbsp;but anyways.. krystine imed sam and sam was like "SHUT UP, WE CANT TALK&nbsp;RIGHT NOW." or something like that.. and krystine got pissed at us.. and we tried saying sorry but it didnt work.. but now were cool. but later that night me and sam were watching tv.. (mtv's wanna come in) and also adult swim.. i didnt really like it much cuz i wanted to watch the real worlds shit they havent shown... but didnt go&nbsp;so well. then me and sam went downstairs in anna's room and&nbsp;were smacking the ball back and forth at eachother! it was soo much fun! i dont kno why though. probably cuz we almost pissed our pants.. ;) but&nbsp;yeah.. i am combinding yesterday and today together sice i forgot to write on the 14th.. but today (the&nbsp;15th)&nbsp; &nbsp; me sam and krystine hung out and went to her grandmas house then went to my g mas house to get picked up.. we rode in the back of the truck and yeah it was fun.. tomorrow i hope sam goes to the movie with me krystine and gabe.. but gabe always has to be an asshole to sam! but did i forget to mention how much i LOVE KRYSTINE AND SAM.. well now i did. on the way to krystines g mas we saw mike! i dont think he saw us though. but i could tell he was going to garys. :(&nbsp; hhmph&nbsp;&nbsp; i miss being someones girlfriend.. o well&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; l8ter

        Today was the worst day ever! i woke up at 11 and stepped on my pen. it sounds stupid but it hurt really bad. i was also looking forward to do something today.. but turns out i had to go to my grandmas all day... but it gets better cuz i made a cake! the only reason i make cake at my grandmas is becuz i like the mix.. not the actual cake..lol. but anyway.. then i was talking to my friend (ex friend actually) i felt so stupid cuz i thought she was someone else.. so i was blabbing on about stuff that she didnt kno i was talking about, and then finally she sed this smart ass comment saying "what the hell are you talking about." so i felt so frichen dumb after that... cuz my WHOLE LIFE she has been trying to be better then me and it gets on my nerves.... so then after that i was talking to krystine and gabe. gabe was making everything difficult by him getting all confused so we all got confused.. but DUDE, ya cant nto get confused with gabe! but thats all i havta say.
