       Baby Bird: "Mother I'm scared, come with me I don't want to fly on my own." Mother Bird:  "You must make this journey on your own."    The Baby Bird was horribly frightened, however, she spread her wings and approached the edge of the branch that her and her mother were sitting on.  Placing all thought and fear out of mind, the Baby Bird jumped of the branch.  At first she fell, tumbling downward, until she spread her wings and soured.  No longer was fear present and excitement grew.          Well the trip to Oregon was nothing like I had dreamn't it to be.  Rather, everything ran smoothly.  Finding my way around all the airports was not nearly as horrible as I thought it was going to be.  In fact, before I set out on my journey I was fractal's hyperventalate.         First Class was amazing and the seats were very comfortable.  The funny thing is neither time I sat in my assumed seat.  I gave up my seat both time so a couple could sit together. The food was also surprisingly descent.       When I arrived finally at my destination in Oregon and saw Amber I was thrilled!  The first night we went to a concert with her cousin and it was amazing, especially at only 8 dollars.  The main act was falling up, who was a group of very cute guys and rock music.  I immediately fell in love with them and wanted there CD. Eddies, dismays, and other bands also performed and they were all very good.  All in all it was a great night even though with time change I was up 21 hours straight.       Today were toured into the Sisters, which are tree snow capped mountains.  The town was adorable and the shops were so much better then anything we have in Mass.  We also went to several other place including a reindeer farm.  Damn are their antler big, how they lift their head is beyond me.       Tomorrow is Daria's birthday and we will have to see what tomorrow brings.

       I believe I've attempted to keep a journal a countless number of times, but have always found myself unsuccessful in doing so.&nbsp; I have always found it quite a challenge to transfer my emotions and thoughts into a language that in understandable to the outside world.&nbsp; As I dance trough live, I grow older and find a need to express myself in words,&nbsp;not necessarily for others to understand me, but to help me understand myself.&nbsp; So for this reason I have chosen to create this online journal and I hope I am able to maintain it.

          Fear is an emotion widely understood my millions all over the world.           &nbsp;     Fear is difficult to control and often surprises those unexpected.           &nbsp;     Fear both&nbsp;associates&nbsp;with good and evil, because it both protects and limits along one's path in life.       For the past week my dreams have been haunted by my upcoming flight to Oregon.&nbsp; This will be the first time in a long while that I have spread my wings and flown and it is the first time I will experience it&nbsp;solo.&nbsp; A baby bird is both excited to see the world and frightened to be on its own when it first leaves its nest and tries to fly.&nbsp; This is how I feel, because I want to land in Oregon so I may see my dear friend Amber, but at the same time I am scared of the journey that I must face inorder to get there.&nbsp; As hard as I try I can not seem to prevent my wild imagination from creating pestimistic outcomes of my journey.&nbsp; Fear and I are jousting, and fear is winning.&nbsp;Yet, I find myself strong enough to remain on my horse and keep on fighting no matter how many times fear pounds my soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only hope my nerves remain calm tomorrow.  (Think)   Everything will be fine. &nbsp; That is all I can do in this battle against fear.&nbsp; Fear will not win!
