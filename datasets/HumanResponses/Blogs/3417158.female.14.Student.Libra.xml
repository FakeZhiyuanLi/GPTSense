      yay! im excited! i got my shoes for continuation!! lol...these r the type of things that excite me, sad i know. just thought id say that...  i hate AAHS, everyone at AAHS thinks my generation is a group of sluts, i know that the fricken second i walk thru those doors, those f***ed up sophmore girls r gonna judge me, along w/ everyone else cuz theyve seen us at EMS the year b4 and theyve got their pet-peeves about us. i hate the fact that the school is on the base and that its so old and worn out and it looks like a prison w/ the florescent lights in the hallways. i walk in and i instantly feel uncomfortable, theres just something about it. ive got my enemies at EMS, and unfortunately they happen to be tight w/ the sophmores and juniors...i just see no point in going to air academy! i know my life's gonna suck cuz i was a huge retard during 6th, 7th, and half of 8th grade and that reputation is gonna follow me to high school...unless...i goto rampart! so, thats where i might go.   my summer is gonna be devoted to hanging out w/ ppl who r my friends at school, but i never end up hanging out w/ outside of school cuz of homework and shit, especially ppl in my neighborhood cuz i feel like an outsider around here cuz i dont even chill w/ my own neighbors outside of school!

      i just got back from my dance company pix...that was stressful. ok, so im in the car and we're goin to target cuz i needed shoes for continuation and some black boy-shorts and my mom gets a call on her cell phone. all the sudden i hear, "WHAT!!? KAYLEE, I AM PULLING YOU OUT OF DANCE COMPANY!!" turns out it was my brother who just got a call from my studio and they said i missed the company picture. so, my mom hits the gas to goto the studio to bitch out my instructor cuz she didnt know that the dance company had pix earlier than the rest of the studio. so, we pull up in front and i we run in and everyone's in costume posing for a picture and kathryn (my teacher) shoves my costume in my face and yells "HOLD IT!! KAYLEE'S HERE!!" so, i run to the bathroom and change, leaving all my clothes in the middle of the floor, run over to the group, and someone puts a white hat on me and my hair was up in a bun cuz i didnt know our hair was supposed to be down, so i look like i have no hair and i look totally out of breath, but yes, im in the company picture...lol  our summer show is in 2 weeks and we're not done choreographing half of our recital pieces! they're trying to throw together 2 more routines at the last minute and it's not gonna work. i can't memorize choreography that fast so im gonna look like a fricken retard...lol! we're supposed to have these hot red-and-fishnet costumes for one of our dances, but either they havent come in yet, or they didnt order them. ill be pissed if they didnt order them cuz, first of all, we payed for them, and second of all, it was my favorite one!! lol...they look like something people would wear in the movie  Chicago ...its hot, lol   we performed 'a midsummer night's dream' on thursday night and turned out way better than expected...major props to martin, josh, and tanner who really made it hilarious!

      im lost in a world of confusion...i don't know who i am anymore...part of me thinks i should goto air academy, the other part thinks i should start over and goto rampart. i don't know wut to do, im sick of my repuatation, im sick of guys ive known since elementry school telling everyone else that im a complete loser, im sick of having my best friends get involving with drinking, drugs, and alcohol and pressure me to do it with them...theres nobody who can relate to me who just wants to go out, date guys, and be happy...no...all my friends are running away from their past, not realizing what the future has to offer! WE'RE ONLY 14! WE HAVE OUR WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF US! you  cannot  tell me that you've already 'experienced' everything and that you're already ready to stop the whole dating/relationships thing at age 14, you make me laugh! our world of guys and exploring our feelings is just beginning! it frustrates me that some people want to grow up too fast, so they get involved with all that at a young age, make some bad choices, then call it quits when high school is just beginning. none of my friends will grow up with me, because they claim they already have...thats bullshit! one of my friends is trying to keep me from making the mistakes she made, when i  know  im smarter than her...my love life is just beginning, when hers has already ended because of her bad choices...i absolutely love her and support her and sympathize with her, but i can't relate. i just want someone who is in my position to relate to me...who's life is just beginning...plz
