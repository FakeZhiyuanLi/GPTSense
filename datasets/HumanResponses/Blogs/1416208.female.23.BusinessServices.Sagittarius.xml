      To mah first true love… Michael vu  I love being with you and discovering new things about you I love learning what makes you laugh And finding the places where you’re most ticklish I love hearing stories about when you were little And listening as you talk about your hopes and dreams I love the sound of your voice when you pick up the phone And the way it sounds when you whisper mah name I love holding your hand And curling up next to each other I love the way I feel when I’m with you  Mah heart belongs to u, Your soul mate …

      LOVE OR INFATUATION? infatuation is instant desire. it is one set of glands calling to one another. love is friendship that has caught fire. it takes roots and grows - one day at a time. infatuation is marked by a feeling of insecurity. you are excited and eager but not genuinely happy. there are nagging doubts, unanswered questions, little bits and pieces about your beloved that you would ust as soon not examine too closely. it might spoil the dream. love is quiet understanding and the mature acceptance of imperfection. it is real. it gives you strength and grows beyond you - to bolster your beloved. you are warmed by his presence, even when hes away. but near or far, you know he is yours and you can wait.  infatuation says, "we must get married right away. i cant risk losing him." love says, "be patient, dont panic, plan your future with confidence." infatuation has an element of sexual excitement. if your honest, you will admit it is difficult to be in one another's company unless you are sure it will end in intimacy.  love is the maturation of friendship. you must be friends before you can be lovers. infatuation lacks confidence. when he's away, you wonder if he's cheating. sometimes you check.  love means trust. you are calm, secure and unthreatened. he feels this trust, and it makes him even more trustworthly. infatuation might lead you to do things you'll regret later, but love never will. love has an upper. it makes you look up. it makes you think up. it makes you a better person than you were before. -chicken soup for the romantic soul

       things have changed so dramatically since last summer. i had mah surgery  , met mah first true love  , met new and loyal friends  , been really productive and handling mah school shit  , parents being so lenient on me    . its almost been a year since all this has happened and im so happy it did. things are about to change this summer too   =) all this would have never happened if i never met you baby! im so glad and very thankful all this happened. ive got to thank mah aunt from yorba linda too. shes helped me as well. if she didnt convince mah parents to let me house sit for her, things wouldnt have an outcome like this.

      wow so many funny ass shit happened today....well more than usual.... ok so me n mah baby r driving around running errands after i get off work and we head back to mah place to pick up some stuff....usually we park in the back and go thru the back door, but this time since we were picking up stuff n making it quik we parked on the street n went thru the front...as we were leaving mike puts on his sandals n heads towards the back door n waits for me while im waiting for him at the front door....there was total silence for a while until i ask "baby where r u? r u at the back door?!? HAHAHA" so we're walking to the car laughing hella hard....oh man...mah stomach hurted the whole drive to his place....lol...then later on that day we were about to head out the house again when mike asks me "hey babe have u seen my keys?" i reply, "nope...you drove earlier" and i check his tall black cubby where he ALWAYS puts his keys n wallet after coming home and it was there....funny ass mike tries to play it off by saying "y u hiding it from me for?" hahaha....wow...to be continued....who knows wat will happen next......tee hee

       wow...now that i think of it....maybe i dont need ne  more friends out hea...mayb i need mah dog LiLi. she can always keep me company at any time of day or night. no doubt. hehe. but it all depends if mah parents will let me bring her up. i have attempted to try once last month, but i got rejected. =( i talked to them last night and told them i really miss her and want her up here and that me n mah roomies r thinking and planning on "buying" a dog.  and mah dad sez that he'll think about letting me bring her up. i guess he's just afraid that she might bite mah roomies or stangers, cuz she did bite the mailman and mah tightest homie, di, that always came over to mah place in la but never did to mah baby who only came several times. crzy huh? i guess she just knew not to do shit to him cuz hes wit me. hehe. well i guess its time to end this blog....until next time

      things have turned around in mah life. school has been pretty good and work is a great experience. overall i still miss la. why? i guess its because i dont have much friends out here. so i cant really hang out with any one while mah baby is hanging out with his. i guess i just need to find new friends. hopefully they're not the backstabbing, shit-talking, power-trippin type. been thru too much to go thru that shit again. i guess we all go thru that in life. go thru friends and get hurt and learn from it. but maybe its just me. maybe i was just taken advantage of. maybe i dont need n e more friends. maybe i only need who i have now. id rather have a couple hella tight friends than hella wat-ever friends that wont b there for u. i dunno. maybe i need at least one or two koo friends in mah area that i can kik it wit at any time when im bored. hehe. maybe i dont. who knows.....i guess i just miss mah familee and homies in la..thats all...hehe....

        To mah mommy.... I can look back  and see that you really always wanted the best for me and how hard you worked to get it. The values you've held on to  are reflected in the care and concern you've always had for me.... and even though we may not agree on everything, you've taught me to think things through, to care, and to do what's right.  On Mother's Day I want to say a very special "thank you" and tell you that  I feel so proud-- and lucky-- to be your daughter. I love mah mommy....

      Havent really written for a whlie, thats prolly because Ive been writing in my personal journal.hehe. A lot has been happening recently. Where should I begin? well I will be moving to Sunnyvale with Sai and Pattey. Excited about the new place, but not the move. hehe. Im very glad that Im moving out of the place Im in now cuz I cant stand the Indian smell and the parking. The new place is very secure and safe. It doesnt have a fitness center but still has a pool which is still kool. The new place requires 7 different keys, thats how safe and secure it is.hehe. very roomy. Hopefully you all can come and visit. to be continued......
