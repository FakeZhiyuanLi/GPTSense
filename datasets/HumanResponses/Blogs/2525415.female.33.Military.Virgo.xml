      I would prefer if I could log on to this thing and write little happy bits all the time. But then it probably wouldn't be very interesting, all cookies and ice cream and no poop-on-a-stick.  The Giant Voice System consists of a series of towers covered top to bottom with speakers...it looks like a barnacled pier support beam rising from the desert floor. Every so often, it comes on and sounds just like the Voice Of God straight from the heavens, or at least just like that part in the  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  when the aliens announce they're about to destroy the Earth and all that is sacred. Last night, the Voice Of God disturbed our quiet New Year's Eve, in which we lazed about in the overheated tent while it snowed outside. We were watching Will & Grace, which I don't watch at home. But neither do I read Glamour. I do both here. Go ahead, judge me.  At any rate, Giant Voice informed us there would be a rocket attack in about four hours. I guess Johnny Taliban was kind enough to give us the exact time, and when I went into the office and sorted through the reporting, even told us what kind of rockets he'd fire, and how many. Better safe than stupid, though, so we all bundled into all our gear and huddled in the bunkers at right around midnight. Happy goddamn New Year's.  It was  cold . I'd planned to just curl up and sleep in there, but nothing doing. It was about 15F with a stiff wind. Chief (that's what we call Warrant Officers) wandered in, and we remembered we hadn't brought the phone in there, as we'd planned...then we heard it ringing in the office. He'd forgotten to switch out the cords. It was the Battalion Executive Officer, Major O, and Chief told him to call back once he'd swapped out the cords--that makes it ring in his tent. He lives with the Chaplain and Major C, the Australian. We heard it ring in his tent, and I stood outside as Chief opened the door...and there was Major C, sitting up in bed with his black knitty cap shoved high up on his head like a gangsta, demanding, " Christ, do you realize what bloody time it is??"  I stepped away from the door and laughed all the way back to the bunker, then told SGT Barnes about it, and we giggled for a good ten minutes.   I can think of other ways I'd rather spend New Year's Eve...ANYWHERE, doing just about ANYTHING else. I'll never forget it, though. And oh, by the way, after all that fuss those bastards fired not one damn rocket. So now they're telling us it could happen tonight!! Screw it, I'm staying in bed...every tiny sound, I'd jerk awake and listen for the scream of the rocket or the explosions...didn't help that our guys fired 105mm illumination rounds all night. Makes quite a racket, that Howitzer, and we're right at Ground Zero for it all, right on the edge of the airfield, about 1000m from the Howitzer position.  So this morning, sleep-deprived and with a splitting headache, I gave the platoon leaders/platoon sergeants at our mineclearing unit a briefing on the current situation, at the request of their First Sergeant. It went well, they were interested and asked great questions. Then I came back to the office, saw that only two people were there, and went back to bed. Lovely, lovely four hours I stayed asleep, punctuated by the drama of the unit we live with, their conflicts and rants. I didn't mind. You live with people, people make noise, there's no use getting your panties screwed up over it.

      Wednesday's Command and Staff briefings constitute the meat and potatoes of my job as an intelligence officer. That's when the battalion staff and the company commanders report to the battalion conference room for formal updates from all the staff sections. My job is to be the unit's subject matter expert on the enemy--their techniques, tactics, and procedures, their significant activities, any trends that have developed, their weapons, and then what it all means/what could come next.  I love it.  I spend my days sifting through the classified reports, and I pull out what I think our unit needs to know, analyze it all, and present it in a user-friendly fashion. I like to really get down into the weeds, pull down maps, get pictures of weapons and the bad dudes who have them, etc.   I brief an abbreviated version every day to the Battalion Commander and the staff, then the big show on Wednesdays. I think my briefing is the only one everyone perks up and listens to--I get a fair number of questions and no one looks at their watch. Today I got down into the forces and factors behind the two attempts to assassinate President Musharref of Pakistan (which would mean trouble for our efforts here, believe me) and the "suicide bombing" near Kabul International Airport. I don't necessarily think it was supposed to be a suicide bombing, but that's just my opinion. Both events are in opensource media, so NO, none of this is classified.  Go somewhere else for your info, Osama, you punk-ass rat bastard!   The rest of the week I feel as though I'm the officer everyone sees taking up space in the office, on the computer all day--it looks like I'm not doing anything much, while all these Engineer officers run around tending to the business of clearing minefields. I feel vindicated on Wednesdays--I really have become an expert on Al-Qaida, the Taliban, and Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin (called the HIG), which is the Other White Meat. They're the terrorist organization no one hears about. It's a group of (mostly) Afghans who are loyal to Hekkmatyer Gulbuddin, the former Prime Minister of Afghanistan. They like to shoot rockets at folks, but I don't think they've carried out anything substantial as of yet. A-Q is easy to identify, they're the foreigners speaking Arabic. The other two groups, though, look and speak just like anyone else in Afghanistan. Makes it difficult to chase them around--and loyalties here often follow either tribal lines or any money trail involved.  I resolve to try to be less of a bitch to officers and NCO's I think are weak. I know I'm judgemental, and I don't apologize for having high standards for the soldiers who, ostensibly anyway, lead other soldiers. But I don't have to vocalize said judgements. There's the only New Year's resolution I care to make--I don't smoke, I only care about my weight when my clothing gets snug or I feel sluggish running, and I think I'll keep the rest of my vices. Because, when you sit down and think about it,  folks who profess they have no vices, generally have no virtues either.

      Rumor Intelligence has it that they have the guy who shot rockets at us a couple of weeks ago. However, experience tells me that it's just as likely the local warlord snatched up some unfortunate muldoon, marched his ass to the front gate, shoved him in and hollered, "Here he is, here's your guy!! And he's gonna lie about it and say it wasn't him!!" The thing is, the local Don is losing between $5000-$10,000 US dollars a week, with the bazaar shut down. That is a FORTUNE here. Hell, it's a fortune  anywhere . The average wage for an Afghan man who isn't processing/selling opium is about a dollar a day. So does that create an environment for corruption, where the warlord would send up some random character, solve the rocket mystery, and get his cash cow back on track? Ya THINK?  I looked at my electric bill online last night, and almost fainted outright... $297!!  And that's with the hot water heater, fridge, and stove turned off! The only thing I can think, is that I left the heat cranked on--it was pretty cold the night I left. So I sent my friend and kitty/house watcher a note, asking her to please turn down the heat for me...the kitties, they got fur. They can live with it a little chilly...that's more than my worst bill last year, even when it was -30F and I was cooking every day.  Did I leave a window open???   On Christmas Eve, we all played this great trivia game, organized and emceed by the lovely Aussie Major...after a great deal of shit-talking from the Lieutenants of Team Haji, my team opened fire and whupped ass. The questions were very unusual--evidently Major C does this in Sydney at bars--like: "What does a spirometer measure?" Spiro=respiration...so that would be lung capacity, score five points for America's Team. The one that clinched it was, "What was the first video played on MTV?" And my Ohio National Guard Captain teammate didn't even hesitate--" Video Killed the Radio Star by the Buggles!!"  Unreal. We get to play again New Year's Day.  This weekend, Qatar. I'm hearing now that people can go down there and sell their beer tickets for $50 each to the jughead Marines. I'm also hearing that the tickets are good for only beer, no wine or margaritas...given that I don't care for beer, it's only natural that I'll profit hugely by selling the tickets. No beer in the world is worth fifty bucks. But then, I'm not a Marine.

      We heard there was a soldier from our battalion killed in a car wreck at Fort Drum, but they didn't tell us who it was. They mentioned it was a young female who was slated to deploy here and hadn't been in the unit for long. The only person I can think of who fits that description is a really sweet, young PFC I always liked. I hope it wasn't her--she always had a smile on her face, and always gave it everything she had in everything she did. I wouldn't want that to happen to anyone, especially not during the holidays like this, but I especially hope it wasn't the PFC I know.  That charming Australian Major likes to print out news stories and editorials from his homeland for me--today it was a commentary on why Australia could be Al-Qaida's next target. It's a possibility...that bombing in Bali killed 88 Australians, and the A-Q affiliated group responsible had to know that would happen.

      I work with an Australian Major who is so charming, he makes me smile just walking into my office. I think I'll ask him, very casually, if the women in Australia are blind or crazy.  Because how is it that some lucky woman has not snatched him up???   Part of the problem for female soldiers in the Army is the existance of women like one of my roommates, who utterly reinforces many of the negative stereotypes...she's whiny, she runs to the doctor every time she sneezes, she's lazy and does everything she can to get out of work and physical training.  It's disgusting. She also hordes all the crap she's gotten in care packages, when the rest of us open them and hand things out immediately. She sat on her bunk a few nights ago chowing down on a huge bin of chocolate chip cookies, talking about some  "Mmm, these are yummy!"  without offering up a single one. She must outweigh me by at least 25 pounds, and I'm not exactly Calista Flockhart.   Her kind are exactly the reason the rest of us have to prove ourselves all over again everywhere we go and why we have to be twice as hardcore as our male counterparts to be seen as equally competent. She faked a "passing out" in the bathroom the other day--I mean, it was PURE drama and PURE bullshit--and demanded we rush her to the hospital...sure enough, no fever, no evident symptoms. The doctor was puzzled by it (I think he suspected it was a performance) but gave her two days off work anyway. This was the FIFTH type incident in two months. To me, it's obvious she wants to get sent home, which shifts the burden of work onto her fellow soldiers. Thank God she's not in my unit, my patience would have run dry long ago. And she's about to make Captain, which is proof positive that the Army will promote ANYONE in the officer corps who hasn't done something drastic, like a DUI or something overtly illegal. Maybe I should stay in, evidently I could put myself on autopilot for the next ten years and get at least as far as Major. But I could never look my fellow soldiers in the eye behaving like that--no one respects her. I was warned about her before she got here, so it shouldn't be any kind of surprise...but I never cease to be amazed at the level of her ineffectiveness as a "leader."  The good news is, I love the rest of my tentmates. Next week they are moving out into a much nicer building, and I'll miss them terribly. Even with all the extra crap piled up in our tent, the noise, all of it, I still love having these ladies around and our tent has been my sanctuary since they came here two months ago.   They are Ohio National Guard, and initially I was put off by the difference in attitudes--and it is just a matter of different perspective, they have careers outside the military while we live this stuff 24/7/365. I got over it, thinking I was better than they are. They're great people and for the most part, great soldiers. So what if they don't do PT six days a week? I care about that stuff less and less...I choose to work out that often because I don't want to get fat and I'd sooner die than fall out of unit run formations when I get back to Fort Drum. They don't have those problems. Well, the unit run part anyway. The point is, there is alot more to a person and to a soldier than the superficial crap like PT and a perfect uniform. I've known so many soldiers with great attitudes who have impeccable performances in their actual jobs, who couldn't maintain a 9-minute-mile to save their lives. And I've known PT studs who were surly, lazy, and worthless on the job. Give me ten of the slowpokes with the great attitudes and send the others to the Infantry.  My own personal soapbox. Sorry.

      This is gonna be a long one...might wanna print this out and settle into an easy chair.  We managed to have a great Christmas around here. I slept late (8 am, late for me) and awoke to a little wrapped gift by my head, and four more outside my little hooch door. Most unexpected. So unexpected, in fact, that I didn't have anything to give anyone...I'd already given little things to most people. So I felt like a jerk all day...it was all little stuff, Dove chocolate, wool mittens from the bazaar (which is still closed), etc. I plan to shop for everyone when SGT Barnes and I go to Qatar next week for four days of day spa trips, jetskiing, and general Lounging Around. I cannot wait. And despite my little irritation earlier about vocal volume, the fact is I adore SGT Barnes. She's great fun and I can't think of anyone I'd rather take the trip with.  The rest of the morning and well into the afternoon, we sat around the hooch (that's our living space, for you civilians out there), cut up cheese and summer sausage for a little hors d'voers (spelling butchered, I know) plate, strong coffee, and six episodes of Sex and the City. We all stayed in civilian clothes, which is strictly verboten, but it felt almost normal wearing my purple fleece hoodie, Army PT shorts, and Old Navy flipflops for a few hours.   And on the subject of civilian clothes, I cannot understand the Army's position over here--we cannot wear them, EVER. Not even on days off. It just does not add up--how exactly is the mission compromised by soldiers in civilian clothes while off duty? This is but one example of the infantry mentality that has driven me to decide I'll leave the Army in 2005 when my obligation is up. The philosophy of making things harder than they have to be strikes me as asinine, given that the Army involves quite enough sacrifice and discomfort. Even the Marines wear civilian clothes off duty, and last I checked, they are also "in a combat zone."   OK, there's my rant for the day. It's actually been a good morning--I awoke about an hour before I'd planned to, so rather than lie there, I got up and went to the gym. They fixed all the treadmills, finally, so I'm a happy soldier in headphones, smoking the crap out of myself on uphill mode. I love running with headphones--it's like a soundtrack for racing against the Kenyans in my little fantasy world. So I was finished really early, ran back to the Engineer compound, and was very dismayed to see the power was out in the shower connex. Damn. So here I sit at my desk with dirty hair...sometimes I wish I had darker hair for this reason, that my hair color dimes me out for not showering. At least I don't stink, after the babywipe/powder/deodorant/change of clothing. I felt like my diapers had been changed.  Laundry--that's how I spent the rest of the pre-dawn. We have a service that will wash your clothes for you, and I sent mine. ONCE. Never again. All the clothes were crammed into the bag willy-nilly, EXCEPT MY UNDERWEAR. My nice little frilly Victoria's Secret panties sat atop the pile, folded and pressed with a reverence normally reserved for religious articles or the baking of fine pastries. The local nationals doing the laundry have surely not seen many pairs of Victoria's Secret panties...if it makes their day to find them in a bag, more power to 'em. But not mine, jack.  The other option is to wash them yourself IN THE GHETTO. It's a trailer of ancient machines, with about an inch of frozen mud on the floor, unheated, with only ice-cold water. But here's the ghetto part--Brown and Root was so lazy installing these things (thank you Dick Cheney!), you have to bring a pair of pliers, get the hose from one end of the building, wrench the spigot on because they didn't even think to give us a handle, and fill the machines. Then return 15 minutes later to refill it for the rinse while you jump up and down to stay warm. It is absolutely comical. This morning, I didn't want to waken the ladies by running in and out all morning, so I grabbed a hot, strong cup of quality joe (Thank you, Rachel!!!) and a trashy fashion mag with Brittney Spears on the cover (that's my level of desperation, I'm NOT a fan), bundled up in the stylin' black fleece jacket they let us wear with PT's here, and sat on a washer, content. Must've been the post-run endorphins reacting to the coffee, but I felt just fine.  And then my day was made again looking at the list of personnel coming over here in late January--among them, my intel Sergeant from my office at Drum. He will be my replacement, I can only assume. There is not enough work for me to do over here alone, and I often end up playing a kicked-up Solitaire game by about lunchtime. I cannot imagine they'll keep us both here. So I could end up going to Mardi Gras after all. I don't care that it's snowing like hell and subzero at Drum, I just want to curl up under my fluffy down comforter, in my fluffy bed, with my fluffy kitties, indoor plumbing, reliably hot showers, a real washing machine, and food cooked by me or the lovely lady down at the Sackets Harbor Brewing Company. It could be only five weeks away.  I will never forget this Christmas. Later in the day (it was yesterday, we're ahead about half a day here), we all ate together at the chow hall, and Sergeant First Class Murphy (he was my NCOIC in the 2-shop at Drum) roared in dressed as Santa, seated on a 4-wheeler decked out with lights and red plywood sides and a Squad Automatic Weapon (that's a machinegun) mounted to the top. It was outstanding. And I feel very close to the Ladies of the Tent, it was right companionable yesterday.  Told you it would be long.

      Ok, it's Christmas Eve, and I have a Most Uncheerful Rant:  I have become so sick of this testosterone-soaked, hostile environment in my office, I actually had to pull the Staff Sergeant (whom we call Angry Boy) outside, lock him up at attention, and let him know in no uncertain terms that I had tolerated all the disrespect I intend to, that I've tried to be patient and keep the peace, and that I've never had to have this conversation before so the problem must be HIS. I've been dodging little snide personal attacks and contemptuous dismissals of my reactions to his verbal diarrhea, constant little attempts to subordinate me and make me look stupid...I'm done with it. I gave him fair warning, if he pulls this shit again, he'll find himself locked up at attention while I unload on him with both barrels, and I don't care who witnesses it. He was incredulous, and stammered some bullshit about how he'd been "just kidding," etc. And Bullshit is exactly what I said to that excuse. I can be a real bitch when I'm this pissed off, and he was on the receiving end of a much-deserved ass-chewing.  The final straw came last night when he remarked that he intends to leave the Army because he doesn't like the people who join it. I expressed that 1) HE had joined, and 2) it will not differ much in any workplace, really. And having spent many years in the civilian workforce, I believe that wholeheartedly...the same personality types are in evidence everywhere, not just the Army. It's a pretty accurate cross-section of America. He sneered, "Where did YOU work, McDonald's?" This from a guy with barely a highschool education, and no adult experience outside the military. And here I sit with two Bachelor's and a good start on a Master's.  That was IT. Ironically enough, McDonald's is exactly where HE'LL work, with no college and military experience limited to clearing mines...sorry, is that a skill most American businesses seek? He joined the Army at age 18, and he's supposed to tell me he knows what's out there in the civilian workforce??? It's the snide dismissals paired with an utterly naive worldview that I can't tolerate. The female Sergeant I work with (the ONLY other female in my workplace, and she's not in this office) is convinced it's a gender-based issue, and I think she's right. I've never heard him talk to a male officer this way. And he treats the female Sergeant the same way. The other slice of this that pisses me off, is the Captain we work with doesn't see it, and I think he has a pretty pronounced female problem himself. These guys are combat engineers, not accustomed to working with females, and it's becoming clear that they never should. "Hostile environment" does not even begin to address what I feel like I deal with in here every day.  I'm ready to go to the Military Intelligence battalion...MI soldiers are much more used to working with/taking orders from females, and it shows. I've never seen this dynamic in an MI unit, and I know it's because MI has four times as many female soldiers, NCO's, and officers. And I want to emphasize, NONE of this is coming from above--the field grade leadership in my battalion is outstanding. It always comes from below or from either side (other company-grade officers), and that tells me it's a matter of dealing with women in authority.   My response? "FUCKING DEAL WITH IT." The gloves are off, boys, and I will ruin your whole day if I need to. Angry Boy has not opened his mouth, not one insufferable little squeak, since it happened...I'm guessing it was exactly what I needed to do, but I HATE being put in that position. I HATE conflict in the office. He left me no choice.

      We had a rare rainy/snowy night. Every time I've lived in the desert (which is the majority of my time in the Army), I've sorely missed rain. Sounds crazy, but when you have the same weather all day, every day, some variety helps. Most people hate Fort Drum for its weather, but I like it for that very reason. Can't say I'm a big fan of subzero temperatures, but there is something to be said for four, distinctly different seasons.  I went to the gym this morning, and the Sergeant Major of the Army was there. I had lunch with him when I was a Sergeant in Korea. A young female soldier came in with a ponytail hanging way down her back, and he politely corrected her, "Hey soldier, you need to fix your hair." She replied, "But I'm in PT's!" Holy crap. Never talk back to a Sergeant Major,  ESPECIALLY IF HE'S THE SERGEANT MAJOR OF THE WHOLE DAMN ARMY!!  She obviously didn't know who he was. And yes, he chewed that ass. He also got her Sergeant Major's name...and by the time that ball of poop rolls all the way downhill, it'll be roughly the size of Manhattan. For you civilians out there, we cannot wear ponytails--hair has to be secured to the head, i.e., in a bun. And it's no different in PT gear, and I don't know who fooled that child into thinking that was okay. We had a good laugh about it in the tent.  The mountains surrounding our location are called the Hindu Kush, which is Persian for "killer." The ones within our view get up to about 17,000 feet, and farther northwest, toward China and Pakistan, they reach 24,000+. K2 is just across the border...this is rugged stuff, this terrain. This particular morning, they sport a fresh layer of snow, just gorgeous. So we'll get a white Christmas, just not all the way down here at our measley 5000 feet.

       "You are Phlegmatic. You have a peace-loving nature, and make a good listener and a faithful friend. You do have a tendency to be selfish and stubborn in your worst moments, and your worrying can lean towards paranoia. Phlegmatics should consider careers as accountants, diplomats, engineers, and administrators. You are a somewhat reluctant leader, but your practicality and steady nerve under pressure makes you a natural choice for leadership roles."   These are the results for a little quizzie I took online...I love those things, they can be way off the mark but more often, they're right on the money. The best ones are on www.thespark.com. Take the Lazy Test. Very entertaining.   My only previous association with being phlegmatic has heretofore involved the buckets of nastiness I cough up every night after running 6.5 miles around the base perimeter...it's a dustcloud the whole way. Gorgeous, with the snowcapped mountains in the pink-purple sunset, but at the end of it even my eyelashes are coated with dust.   But regarding the dust, it's compounded with thick black smoke from the Haji's (local nationals, probably NOT a politically correct term) burning nasty trash out there. It's extra uncomfortable running past this scene, because women in Afghanistan do not run, and they most certainly do not wear shorts. So all work comes to a screeching halt whenever a woman in shorts runs past...even when they (as in, I) have unbelievably white legs. That probably adds to the freakishness of it for them. I'm wondering when we'll start to hear about Operation Enduring Freedom Syndrome, characterized by degraded lung capacity, copious volumes of phlegm, and a marked reluctance to run outside in shorts.   About three weeks ago, I wrote an email to Green Mountain Coffee in Vermont...I've been drinking it since 1991-92, when I spent two summers in Maine teaching art and they had it in all the best restaurants and cafes. So I asked them to send us a bunch of free shit, because it doesn't hurt to ask, right? Well, yesterday a huge box showed up with SIXTEEN POUNDS of free coffee, packaged in those nice little one-pot pouches. No more messhall slop-joe for the office! I'm putting together a thank-you note signed by all of us, with a picture of us all grinning with coffee mugs in hand. Cheesy, yes it is, but it's the least we can do. That's a couple hundred bucks worth of java.  Every so often, people do things in support of deployed soldiers that just blow my mind...the Red Cross office is overflowing with packages sent by individuals and corporations full of every conceivable item for soldiers. Too bad the crumbly old guy running that office somehow thinks it's his own personal stash, and refuses to allow us back into the TRAILER full of packages to choose what we want. Somehow I don't think that was quite the intent.  Every night in my tent, we all get together and watch at least one episode of Sex and the City...we started with the first season and we're all the way up to Season Four. We make all kinds of noise, hollering at the set, critiquing the fashion, laughing...I'm sure it drives everyone around us nuts. It's especially fun if we can get a male in there to watch along--it's shocking stuff for most of them, especially surrounded by six raucous women. We bought the DVD's at the bazaar, which is still on hold until they can find out who shot the rockets. Rat bastards.

      You know, it's a bit of a burden to have two blogs running at once. Perhaps I should just stick with the private one.  The Engineer Compound hosted a big Christmas party yesterday--a fiercely contested volleyball match dominated by the Koreans and the Polish. The Americans, despite much Talking of the Shit, got dusted off DIRECTLY by those little Koreans. And that was after the Koreans had performed this rather girly group dance set to techno music by their Marines in Tae-Kwon-Do outfits. It reminded me of "Vogue." Our guys snickered all the way through it, so it made me happy to watch the Koreans just effortlessly beat the crap out of them. The Polish looked like an Olympic team. Two of my tentmates called the tallest one "Hotty Body," and watched from the sidelines closest to whatever position he played. They rotated with him.   I slept for close to twelve hours last night. It's Sunday here, and our only day off. Yesterday I built this funny-looking little tent over my bed in an attempt to block out the lights that don't get turned off until late in the night. I get up very early to go to the gym, and these ladies don't bother with that for the most part. Incompatible sleep habits call for drastic measures...i.e., my little tent. Michelle (a Major and quickly becoming a close friend) remarked that it looked like something her kids would make out of the dining room table. She's right. I don't care. I slept like a baby last night, despite all the aircraft. You can hit the runway with a rock from our back door, so it gets a bit noisy at night, depending on what operations are being launched at any given time throughout the operating area.  We all lazed around all morning. It felt great. My friend Rachel at home in New York sent me this lovely coffee, and then I ordered some more online. I donated two pounds to the office and to the tent, and kept the rest for myself for use with my little French press pot. It almost felt like a normal Sunday morning--strong coffee, a good book (I'm reading the Best American Short Stories of the Twentieth Century, edited by John Updike), and my tentmate family. And we get another lazy morning on Thursday for Christmas.  Things really aren't so bad here.

      You know, it's only been a couple of hours since my last post, but I'm already finding myself observing situations and composing posts covertly in real time.  One challenge of our crowded living conditions is that it adversely effects my noontime nap. I have five roommates--two other officers and three NCO's. There is nothing finer during the midday than stepping into the dark tent, curling up, and setting my watch timer for thirty minutes of sweet catnap. Unfortunately, my roomies aren't on this sheet of music. SGT Barnes is the loudest of them all, and I can always hear her coming from 50 meters outside the tent. That's generally the sound of Catnap Over.   The tent door is made of wood, and when we got here I rigged a cord weighted by a large waterbottle strung to the outside that keeps the door closed. It also causes it to slam if not closed manually. The head of my bunk is about 18 inches from the door, and each slam jolts the bunk and has roughly the same effect as a pair of cymbals crashing together. And I lie there, consciously forcing patience on myself, suppressing the urge to shout, "For Chrissakes, don't slam the goddamn door!!" Because of course it's the middle of the day. But it happens every time someone gets up for a portapotty run in the middle of the night as well. I'm a light sleeper--kiss of death and one of the many reasons I choose to live alone when I have that control. I will say, however, that when we were attacked with 107mm rockets the other night, I was the first one up and into that bunker...I was wide awake before the first one impacted.  I debated the inclusion of the rocket attack in any communications with family until I read it on CNN.com. In my assessment, I'm about as likely to get hit by a rocket as by a bolt of lightning. We live on a large compound with a vigorous Quick Reaction Force. The rockets used by the Anti-Coalition Militants tend to be old, barely operable, and wildly inaccurrate. We haven't been rocketed since July. What I'm trying to say is, don't worry when you see this type report in opensource media, especially since my light-sleeperness gets me into a protected bunker in under a minute, literally. It means I freeze out there because I generally don't take the time to bundle up, but I won't be the dumbass killed in the tent reaching for warmer socks!

      Well, this one is similar to the other one, only I can be a little more specific on events and people and the daily dramas that make life interesting over here. I would not be happy if certain things ended up on the news as a by-name quote. I'd definitely have some explaining to do. Again, the language could get colorful from time to time. Also, I won't have to give so much background information, since ya'll know me and at least a little bit about what I do.  Robin Williams visited our compound yesterday. He was hilarious, but more importantly, he was warm, genuinely glad to be here and took his time signing autographs and posing for pictures with the troops. It put alot of smiles on faces around here and I respect anyone who would take time from their holiday season to spend several days on a plane to come over here and visit with us. He also went to one of the firebases, where they actually have rocket attacks several times a week.   Geraldo went to the same firebase, but only so he could broadcast live from "the most evil place in Afghanistan." He got a bird's eye view of just how evil Shkin can be when one of the vehicles in his convoy hit an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), flipped off the road, and seriously injured two soldiers. He broadcast a few minutes afterward on Fox News (which, by the way, I think is the most absurdly-biased media outlet in the country and I keep wondering when Rush Limbaugh will appear as a regular commentator). He looked a bit rattled, his hair was ruffled and in the background our infantry guys fired large weapons at a ridgeline to the south of the road.   NO, I am NOT in that kind of danger here, don't worry when you see this stuff on the news. But to be fair to Geraldo, he is overtly pro-soldier when so much of what you see about the military portrays us as uneducated barbarians.  Many thanks to everyone who sent packages--my desk looks like the counter at 7-11. My buddy Tracey from Philadelphia sent this huge assortment of Tasty Kakes and now everyone's walking around the office imitating that fluffy little Southpark kid demanding snacky cakes and cheesy poofs. We have three total Christmas trees in the office--a tiny one on my desk I got for 2 bucks at the PX, a 1 1/2 foot tall one with white lights, and a 3-foot tall one with colored lights and glass ball ornaments. One of the recent packages included little candy canes, and I've hung them everywhere...on all the Christmas trees, all over our tent, even on lock hasps in the doors.

      It was a bone-chilling morning, down into the teens. Temperature inside my hooch: 42ºF. I have learned, therefore, to make some adjustments:  1)  I go to bed at around 1500Z, or about 7:30pm. That's when the temp dips below 60º inside and my hands start to go numb. Initially, I'll wrap up in the sleeping bag and read by flashlight for a bit. Then it just gets too uncomfortable for my hands, and I'll snuggle down into the bag, pull on my gloves and fleece sleeping cap, and daydream about home until I fall asleep. And I sleep like a baby in that cold.  2)  Since I go to bed earlier than most small children, I get up at midnight zulu time, which is 4:30am local. I spend at least an hour hurting myself in the gym in order to atone for my wickedness during the Christmas season, and run back to the hooch, where I'll be able to see my breath for several more hours.  3)  Changing clothes and getting out of the warm bag are the two times the cold becomes an issue. Changing clothes becomes bearable with the help of my super-high-powered hair dryer. I warm up the clothes, jump into them, then stick the hair dryer down my shirt until I'm toasty. Then the fleece gloves get fluffed up with hot air, and I'm good to go. I'm sure if there was a hidden camera in the tent, this would all be very amusing to a (warm) outside observer.  Bite me .  As for the trouble of getting out of the warm bag, I haven't quite figured that one out yet. I just jump into my warm jacket and sprint out the door to the toasty bathroom, then run to the gym. If anyone has any suggestions as to how to make it more pleasant going from warm snuggly sleeping bag into 40º tent, please notify me. "Just don't get up" isn't an option.

      Mefloquine. It's the anti-malarial medication we're forced to take here. Only I didn't take it initially, because I remember well how I reacted to that crap the last time. If you read the patient insert, it even states that no one's really sure WHAT it does to folks, psychologically.  It was down in South America, in a dangerous, high-stress area, and our mission was aerial reconnaissance. WE weren't in danger, theoretically, because we were on a  heavily -guarded airbase belonging to the host nation. I, however, was under virtually no stress--my job was maintaining our secure satellite system, and as long as it worked, I had very little to do besides read the wonderful and fat Faulkner short story collection I'd brought, and play with the weird, sand-colored rabbit that liked to hang out with us. It belonged to the Colombian General's daughter and would sit on your lap, docile as a kitten, until such time as it would, for no evident reason, decide to bite a chunk from your thigh.  A sidebar about the rabbit: we also adopted an adorable little Sharpei puppy called Bubba. My favorite place to be was in the lovely little lounge area, on the pretty little tropical-looking couch, with the bunny on one side and Bubba on the other, book in hand. Bubba, Still a Dog despite his youth and diminutive size, never took his eyes off that plump, physically imposing rabbit. Tell me he wasn't thinking,  "Just you wait until I'm bigger, you fat morsel, you hogger of lapspace, you Whore of Babylon."   Another sidebar regarding the animal population in this land: the iguanas. Forget what you know about them, forget that you've seen them fat and somnolent on the back of your college buddy's couch. In the wild, they are as big as your full leg, not counting the tail, and will Directly Kick Your Ass if provoked.   Each day we went to the local guy we called affectionately, "Pan Man." Pan being Spanish for "bread," of course. Usually, a small crowd of us, mostly the pilots not out on mission, would pile into the minivan and strike out for Pan Man. He had lovely, fresh cheese-filled bread, little filled rolls made with the meat of the small coconuts growing right outside his back door. I gained 8 pounds down there.  One day, we piled in and headed for Pan Man. It was a perfectly sunny, hot morning. One pilot was one of these Rambo-type older men, who's done and seen it all and whose stories I love to hear. Plus, he was identifiably Southern, which further endeared him to me. He was mid-story, full-tilt, when he suddenly interrupted himself to exclaim, "Holy SHIT! Look at that iguana! Stop the car, I need a picture!"   So we dismounted. The iguana was indeed a poster-child for Bad Ass Reptile. He/she looked damn near prehistoric, and seemed utterly unintimidated as we crept up for pictures. Just then, a couple of young, Colombian soldiers laid down their bikes and walked up, speaking rapid-fire Spanish and staring at me. I was in uniform, and they NEVER see women in uniform. Everywhere I went with the red hair and the uniform, it attracted a great deal of attention. Formations of marching troops would stumble on each other, drivers turn their heads all the way back, narrowly missing trees, ditches, and people. And I did NOT relinquish a runway-modeling career to join the Army.  These boys, they were in full-machismo mode, ready to show off their comfort level with the native wildlife. One broke a stick off the tree this majestic iguana lounged under. It didn't move, but followed all the motion with its strange, bi-directional Iguana Eyes. The young soldier, smiling at me, prodded the iguana. It hissed. We began to comment, "Look at this crazy sumbitch, he's fixin to get tangled up...ok, just keep on, big guy. That lizard will straight hook you up."  He prodded it again. It hissed louder, and turned toward the stick. The other soldier danced around it like a soccer player, laughing and cutting his eyes at me.  He prodded it a third time. It didn't move for a few seconds. Then it suddenly exploded. It leapt right up on the dancing soldier, directly commenced to Kicking His Ass. It looked and sounded like a leopard fight. The other madly pulled at it, trying to get it off his buddy. So it turned on him instead, just POUNCED on him, hissing madly and ripping with those big teeth and claws. It decided it had proved its point, and ran off toward the jungle at a high rate of speed,  on its hind legs , which went elliptical with speed.  The whole scene looked like something out of a cartoon, or maybe When Animals Attack. The Mefloquine helped here, I feel sure.  We were in tears, on the ground with laughing. The pilots mostly speak Spanish, and managed to half-crawl out to the poor boys, still weak with laughing. They looked like hell--clothes torn, cut up. But okay, if a little sheepish.  So it should have been a lengthy vacation. It was beautiful down there, monsoon season--lush and green, mangoes falling from the trees (or being cut down by muscular, brown-skinned men who hadn't seen many redheads in their time), the coffee and food were cheap and delicious, we lived in air-conditioned trailers with TV/VCR's, refrigerators, etc.  In the meantime, I buzzed around trying to hide my rising panic. I had horrendous, Technicolor, virtual reality dreams that kept me up all night, terrified. I just  knew  that all my counterparts hated me and wished me dead. Convinced I'd been ostracized and banished from the other Sergeants, including my roommate Jen (who, as it turned out, truly was stabbing me in the back and earned herself a permanent seat on my I Wouldn't Let You Lick the Sweat from My Armpits If You Were Dying of Thirst list), and my only ally down there was First Sergeant B, who has since become a very good friend. Following one incident in which I'd had to forcibly restrain myself from a verbal and possibly physical assault on another Sergeant (a guy I still think is a total bitch), I went to the Chaplain.   I explained to this good man that I was losing my mind and should either go home or find some kind of medication to temper my loss of sanity before I really screwed up. His first question, "Are you taking Mefloquine?"  Me: "Yes, sir."  Chaplain: "You know, it has psychological side effects in some people, especially women." No, I didn't know. A flash of lightning. A thunderbolt.   Why don't they TELL you this shit, so you can calm yourself down?? I was  immensely   relieved. I wasn't losing my already loose grip on reality. From then on, I could laugh about it, recognize that onslaught of barely-controlled panic, hold my tongue and count to ten: "One-Mefloquine, Two-Mefloquine..."  So now I'm forced to take this crap again. That could explain the cookie-scandal. I'd forgotten how crazy this shit makes me: manic-depressive, defensive, paranoid, generally disagreeable.   I've worked at becoming a supportive friend, especially to other females, and the way I accomplished this was to gauge how I felt after venting to someone--was I  angrier?  Feel silly? Or was it a satisfying interaction, after which I was already starting to laugh about it? So now when someone vents to  me,  I know what they want: for you to act indignant, to get riled up  with  her/him, that's all anyone needs to do.   And I can be REALLY good at it! When Major K, my female former tent-mate, vented to me about her crusty old boss who seems to stalk her, is evidently obsessed, I responded,  indignantly , "How the hell does he think he's even in your LEAGUE? Has he seen a mirror since he's been here? I mean, PUH-LEEEZE!!" Her face immediately softened. It was exactly what she needed to hear, and I knew it.  My friend Luci just got blown off by her spoiled brat of a niece, whom Luci has more or less put through college and whom she'd asked to clean her rental property in New Orleans, a tiny act in the face of the thousands of dollars Luci's given this little girl. My response, "Jesus Christ, has the world gone INSANE? If she's living in your rental, I'd call the cops and have her put out on her ASS! I wish someone would've given ME a college education in exchange for cleaning a house!" Again, exactly what she needed to hear.  SGT B, however, the woman I live with, has clearly not had many female friends. If I came home riled up at having seen someone stomp a kitten to death, her response would sound like, "Well, you know, everyone's under stress and a long way from home, and you know National Guard, they don't roll like us...blah blah blah." She'll take the  other person's side  against you, after which you'll find yourself pissed at HER in addition to the original transgression that pissed you off in the first place.  So now I just go to Major K. She has learned the same lessons I have. When I was raging pissed about the cookies, she raged right along with me, spoke of the Rules of Etiquette and Basic Decency that had been violated, and we analyzed the many faults of The Butthole.  So, at the end of this novella-length post, comes the moral of the story: Just Be On Your Friend's Side, Always. Even if she's completely irrational and half-crazed from Mefloquine. She'll eventually laugh about it and get over it on her own, but when she's riled up,  just get riled up with her .   It's so simple. How come so few people GET it??

      Last night, snuggled down deep into the many layers of techical gear I now require to stay warm through the night, I dreamed I went home for mid-tour leave. Only it wasn't my home now, it was my former home in New Orleans...only much better. Many palatial rooms, tall ceilings, wood floors, but the furniture was the lovely collection I have now rather than the ugly-covered-with-pretty-cloth cheap shit I had then.   It was raining, all the more like New Orleans. I looked out the window to see a crew of Gina Bobrowski sculptures, discarded in the gloom. I plotted a midnight foray out there to steal them. The cats didn't know me at all, seemed very annoyed when I tried to pick up first Esther, then Oscar, the whores. Rachel was there, planning a building-wide party for all the occupants: myself, her, Major C the Aussie, and some other Australian that Maj C disliked so strongly, he got pissed off at the very mention of the guy's name. And Rachel, she had turned the fridge on, then left it open. Food rotted openly and I noted that every single appliance in the kitchen hummed right along...thus, the $300 electric bill mystery solved. The house was a wreck, and I lounged on my plush, pillowtop bed thinking I had two weeks to clean it up, then I had to come back to Afghanistan. But for that moment, it was quiet, it was raining, I was in my own bed, and it was directly time for a nap.  I dreamed of napping. How does that work? Do you fall deeper into sleep when your dream self drifts off?

      Here are some prevailing Afghan superstitions and I swear I'm not making these up:  o  Cover your bald head or else it may start raining. o  Don't click the scissors, it will bring about a fight. o  Don't look at the new moon in the face of a child, he will fall down. o  I bit my tongue, someone must be backbiting me. o  If water from a bowl spills out with a sound, a guest will come. o  If you arrive somewhere at a time when others are just starting their meals, it means that your mother-in-law likes you very much. o  If you shake a bunch of keys, it may bring about a fight. o  If you sit in the doorway, your father will be in debt.  I suppose that sharp sounds (scissors, keys) enrage some Afghan men to the point of physical violence. I also suppose it's no mystery why the Soviets were able to scare the shit out of them with red lights--they thought that if they hit them, they'd immediately vaporize to a pile of ashes, like in a Bugs Bunny cartoon when someone gets hit by lightning. Given it hardly ever rains, I'm thinking most Afghan men sport a full head of hair under those Mullah caps.

      Dick Cheney's Brown and Root, in their infinite wisdom and unflagging dedication to making life a little easier on soldiers, unplugged half the power to our tent heating system. It was 41F in there all night long, and it only went down to 30. In the next few days, it's supposed to get back down into the mid-teens.   Here's what I wore to bed: fleece hat, gloves, two layers of polypro (the Army's layering system, like a fleece 1/2 zip sweat top) top and bottom, two pairs of socks, in a double-layer sleeping bag. I called today because I thought it had to be broken, because I wouldn't make my  cats  sleep in 41 degrees. And they have fur. Nope, it was intentional, they refuse to give us the power back, and now we're stuck sleeping like Sta-Puffed Marshmallow ladies. It makes it intensely difficult to get out of the bed at 4:30 am for physical training, especially since no one is looking, no one would know if I just rolled back over and snuggled down a bit deeper into the layers of sleeping bag.  The part of this that makes it outrageous is that our National Guard counterparts who just got here had little buildings, called B-Huts, built--nice solid walls, a real roof, and TWO heat units in each. They only have to run them part time, and their abodes stay solidly in the 70's through the night. They tuck in to bed wearing shorts and bare feet, and arise refreshed and warmed in the morning. We live right next door, in  el barrio , with ice on the water bottles inside the tent.   Do you see why a career move might be in order as soon as I'm eligible? Try getting up in the night, bladder bursting, only to put on more layers and run about 500 yards to the stinky latrine, often in the rain or snow, run back to the frigid tent, and spend the next ten minutes rewarming your bed. I'm solidly tired of the reindeer games. I'm all for serving my country, and I know that a combat zone has inherent discomforts, but when you CAN make things better but choose NOT to,  that's  when I have a problem with it. The Army is all about making things harder than they have to be.  Thanks, Dick Cheney. I bet the Brown and Root guys sleep nice and cozy in their little buildings. No uninsulated, draft-plagued, unheated tents for them!

      And it is. One Cold Day in Hell.  Cold because it's, well,  cold .  Hell because one of our mineclearing Sappers stepped on a landmine. We haven't heard about his condition--they wear extensive body armor, but nothing can protect legs from a direct mine strike. That soldier is probably alive, but from the waist down, in serious trouble.  What a world for the Colonel to come back to later tonight..."Hey, sir, welcome back, a soldier stepped on a mine." What an even worse world for his family back in New York.  And we have all been around each other too damn much. Everyone's snapping at each other, we grate each others' nerves, just pure annoyance. SGT B just came in here--and granted, things are a little tense, a little hectic following the minestrike--and got all excited at ME about some reporting procedure mixup that is NOWHERE near my lane, I wouldn't know a  thing  about it. So I told her to back off, stop wasting her time over here in front of my desk hollering, get out there and fucking  fix it yourself . My tolerance for disrespect is right at about zero, and she walks that line on a daily basis. Love her to death, most of the time, but when she raises her voice, I'm done listening and will likely raise my own in response.  More drama:  Captain D visited my office earlier--we both work on force protection issues, so end up communicating quite a bit. He kept "Kim this," and "Kim that." I didn't ask. He offered. "That's my wife, by the way." ??  I'm guessing word must've reached him that I had a naughty dream in which he figured prominently. I've dreamed naughty about Santa Claus, buddy, it means nothing...tell your wife--Kim, that is--that she has nothing to worry about from the weird redheaded Intel lady.  I just heard that the soldier will lose most of one leg. It could easily have been much worse.  I also just heard that The Butthole might be attracted to me! HUH??? I am the only female officer in the entire area, but unless he's completely inept with women, I don't believe it for a second. I think I would've picked up on something, especially since my impression has been that he can barely  tolerate  me.  And I still think I'd put the Australian between two slices of bread and call it Love Sammich. He's the only one around here I haven't seen act like a jackass, myself included. I lost my temper over  cookies , for chrissake.  So much for that New Year's resolution about not letting the Dumb Shit get to me. Cookies. Can't get much dumber than that. I feel silly about it now.

He told me about UAV, and I WANT IT. Given that it's a new platoon, I think my leadership and technical experience could be big assets. What do you think? If there's anything I can do to press my case, please let me know.  We're just suffering over here with sunny, 60 degree days. I went to Qatar and suffered likewise there through the arduous, 80 degree long-weekend I spent there. We met up with a retired CSM who lives in Doha and has established relationships with all kinds of merchants there...pearls, perfume oils, etc. I bought a gorgeous rug from Turkmenistan. I just have to figure out how to keep the kitties from using it as a lovely, horizontal scratching post.

However, they received a UAV W.O. the other day, and the plan for a building on the airfield is progressing.    I will send a note to MAJ W***.  The real way to get a job is for LTC W*** to mention to LTC B**, or less visibility have MAJ P** or MAJ M**** mention it to MAJ W**  that you are doing a great job and would be the greatest UAV platoon leader in the Army.

He was also pushing GSR, which I didn't know females could even lead. I'm not sure I'd love spending my life in the field, but if that's what they give me, I'll tout the virtues of portolets and subzero temps all day long. I'll see what I can find out regarding UAV from this end, and maybe hit up MAJ Price and/or MAJ Milhorn to put in a word just in case.  Thank you for the guidance--  LT Boyden  -----Original Message----- From: B***, Kristen LT  Sent: Tuesday, January 13, 2004 10:14 PM To: P***, M** J MAJ G3; M***, J* L 41st ENG Subject: FW: New Request  Gentlemen--  This is the email trail between MAJ G*** at G2 and myself--bottom line is, I hear they're standing up an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle platoon, date unclear, and I would love to be its first Platoon Leader. Regardless, I'll be with the 41st until late spring/early summer, so please don't think I'm trying to bail! I just figure now is the time to lobby for the platoon I'd most like to lead when the time comes.   I know MAJ G*** from out in Sackets Harbor, if it sounds a little familiar. His initial recommendation was that I take Collection and Jamming, given that I used to repair those systems as a 33W and know them like the back of my hand. I'm a little conflicted on that idea. While I know that kind of familiarity would make me an effective PL, on the other hand it seems doing something I have no experience with at all might hand me a steeper learning curve.   I'll take whatever they give me and run like a scalded dog with it, regardless.  If either of you has contact with MAJ W***, I would really appreciate it if you'd put in a word for me. Please let me know if you have any guidance from your end.  V/R--  LT B***   How many degrees of separation? It's a Kevin Bacon gig.  This is how things get done in the Army. You see a position you want, you lobby for it. I have a feeling the UAV is too far down the road for me to get ahold of, but it certainly doesn't hurt to express an interest. I'd like to know what I'll be doing in four months, in any case.

      Someone sent me a package of New York sharp cheddar cheese. I thought it a bit odd at the time, a pack of regular cheese in with all the baked goods and snackies. I contemplated the average temperature of the inside of a canvas mailbag, and couldn't help but wonder:  Could a quarter-pound of New York cheese make it all the way to Afghanistan without becoming an e. coli culture ?   My refrigerator is my windowsill. I keep bottles of water and a bottle of salsa out there, and the wooden window closes tight over it. It's even screened on the outside, so no one can steal my loot. Just now, I took out the cheese, absently thinking I'd risk it and have a nibble.  It's been so long since we've seen real cheese around here, I'd forgotten how amazing it tastes. The chow hall's version of cheese, as with all else, is some super-preservative-laden, tasteless "processed cheese food," I'm sure the actual lable would read. And right now I have a piece of the real deal in my mouth. I just ate almost the whole package. Each bite I slice off with my Gerber knife, my brain cries out, "Stop! You can't eat the whole block! You're going to be HUGE when you get home!"   But I can't help it. I can't stop.  Must go to the gym. NOW.   Lapses into food coma.

      Yep, I'm listening to some quality Marvin Gaye and browsing the sites of other Ladies Who Blog. Private G is on Extra Duty (a form of punitive pergatory) for sleeping on guard duty, and is (astonishingly) singing along with Let's Get It On as he sweeps out the office. He knows the words and everything, and he cannot be older than twenty. I'm watching this young soldier out of the corner of my eye--he's very courteous and respectful, very good-looking...of course, WAY too young for me, this is a strictly anthropological study. But I bet he  knocks those little ladies down , good-looking, good-natured young man who can sing Marvin Gaye.  The other Private on Punishment Sweepout Detail is Private GS, a painfully acne-scarred but highly intelligent kid, one you just know they picked on cruelly throughout schooling. I don't know what it is about me that makes complete strangers tell me their deepest, darkest secrets and solicit advice.   Private GS just found it suitable to disclose that he has miserable, cystic acne on his back. In these situations, I have become adept at NOT appearing appalled or revolted. I dispensed the sage advice that he ask a doctor about Accutane, which I took at great personal expense when I was about 22. He won't go to the doctor for it, because the Sapper dynamic is that you "suck it up," never see a doctor unless you're on your deathbed. I imagine it would be an uncomforable conversation with the hardassed Platoon Sergeant, that you're going to the doc for zits. Poor kid. I told him to hell with what these jive turkies think, take care of it.   Private G, for whom life has been a Sunday cakewalk with the ladies fawning at his feet, glances sideways at him every so often. Doesn't seem to sneer at him in doing so, maybe he's just wondering what life must be like for the Not So Beautiful People.  My favorite blogs so far (I'm very picky):  http://shauny.org/pussycat/ http://belledejour-uk.blogspot.com  For some reason, I cannot get the hyperlink feature to work. You'll have to copy/paste, I'm afraid.  The first one, the best I can tell, is a young Australian living in Scotland, great storytelling style. Belle, on the other hand is a high-end London callgirl, and a  talented  writer. Yep, it gets a bit, um,  unsavory , but she's funny as hell and it's a glimpse into a life that is about as far from my own as you can get on the Planet Earth. I read it every day.  The Ladies seem to rule the Blog. Perhaps it's because we often begin keeping journals (please, if you want to live to see the light of another morning, don't call it a  "diary " unless you're referencing something from Charles Bukowski) as preteens.   "Journalling." The matrons of Weight Watchers tout it at every meeting. I read article after article about keeping a "food journal," how it's the key to weight loss because you think about all the crap you gulp down the gullet. They may be onto something.  I'll concoct an entry on my forays into the world of Weight Watchers some other time. It's a great program, it works, but I'm just a human like everyone else and I Love to Eat.  Judging by other folks' blogs, I am very low-tech indeed. They put fancy photos and fonts and cool headings, etc. I'm rather Mary Jane by contrast. But then, I don't really have the time to teach myself HTML. Belle's site is a bit better-looking--and better-written--than mine, but Shauny's looks fabulous. I would like that feature where people can leave comments. It's probably something you have to pay for, and I've already invested so much time in this here blog, I don't care to switch 'em out.  I listened to a commentary by Andre Codrescu on NPR yesterday about blogs--he opined in his inimitable Hungarian, drama-laced deadpan that they are the final frontier for the egomaniac. He could be right. Personally, I don't care if Not One Soul reads this thing. I plan to print it out when I get home and have it as my travel log.   Despite my little fits of anger mismanagement and daily annoyances, I'm fortunate to have a life interesting enough to write about. Things could be worse. I could, for instance, be bored. And boring to boot.   Suddenly, The Butthole and all of Afghanistan don't look so bad.

      I went back and deleted yesterday's post--not out of fear of retribution or discovery, but because it just wasn't very interesting. I vented mightily for several days in a row. Here's the condensed version.   What it more or less boils down to, is that some folks just didn't get hometrained as children and subsequently have poor manners. Case in point: a certain officer I don't like anyway raided my package of lovely homebaked treats (baked and sent to me by a sweet old lady back home), ate several vacuum-packed pouches of said Scooby-snacks, didn't leave me a single piece to at least  sample , then  threw the trash all over my desk .   If you don't get it, I can't explain it to you.   There's no accounting for such bad behavior. And that's just one such incident in a long line of tiny dismissals and little spoons full of poop. This is the same guy who sees no problem with buddyfucking anyone to his left, right, or south, because, "That's the principle of selfless service, you have to put up with bullshit."  Bitch, please . He would gladly and without shame or hesitation kick you to the curb and step on your broken, bloody back if it would earn him one coolpoint with anyone in the rank of Major or above. Makes my stomach turn.   Listening to this drivel for ten hours a day has completely sapped my motivation and solidified my determination to get the hell out of this testosterone-soaked bullshit. FBI, here I come. Sure, more testosterone, but it's the Infantry mentality in the Army I can't abide. There are no positions in the FBI that are denied to women, so it's bound to be less of a boys' club.  On the brighter side, Qatar was lovely. I spent more money than was wise or reasonable, but when will I ever have that opportunity again? I bought a perfectly gorgeous rug, made in Terkmenistan. Just incidentally, the oldest rug remnant in known existance is from Terkmenistan...I can cook up a great story about how my rug is from the same tribe, no, the same  family  as that original remnant. In fact, (insert Terkmenistanish-sounding name here) is a  direct descendant  of the inventor of woven rugs. The technique has been passed down through each generation for these thousand years.  This discussion sparked a pointless debate in my office. S asked the question, "Was the first rug  invented  or  discovered ?" In my mind, the clear answer is "invented," as "discovered" implies the thing existed in that same state and was stumbled upon by a human. "Invented" requires action/intervention, and an idea to spawn the thing. Think about it: the wheel--invented. Tools--invented. The planet Mars: discovered, no one built it. The duckbilled platypus--discovered, although bears a close resemblance to what your mother said would happen if you bought separates instead of complete outfits.  S argued for "discovered," because he said the first rug would've been a skin someone threw on the floor. Well, it's still invented, because someone had to skin the unfortunate animal and then think about the fact that the skin might feel mighty nice on bare feet.  We have entirely too much time on our hands.   The Butthole, he is heretofore dubbed, is leaving for several days on a mission he thinks is super-squirrel, but I know is what's called a "boondoggle," meaning pointless. Lucky for me, though, the LT who will assume his responsibilities while he is gone is one of my favorite people here. Not in a Love Sammich way, in a Completely Guileless, Funny, Fun to Hang Around Like a Really Cool Little Brother way. The difference in the office environment is like prison vs. birthday party with cake and ice cream. HE never would've eaten all my food without asking.

      "You have very strong body, ma'am."  This from the Filipina message lady, as she pounded me into submission. It's true, I have a very strong, muscular body, moderately padded with a little layer of fluff. But she was fluffier, so I didn't mind being bared like that.  What I've noticed about the super-cheap messages you get in non-Western countries: they tend to be canned, production-line affairs, you need not be shy whatever your body type because they've seen it all, and they pound the crap out of you like a butcher tenderizing meat. Still felt great. So did the manicure, pedicure, and facial I got along with it, for a whopping forty-eight bucks. It would be twice that AT LEAST in the States...but then again, you'd get very tailored, personal service from someone who has trained extensively on the musculoskeletal system and won't climb up on the table and dig an elbow into your spine until you want to scream.  The facial, I think I'll skip next time...my skin is so sensitive, the whirring scrub machine has me all swollen and red now. And the nice lady rubbed every product straight into my clean hair. For those of you who don't know me, I have baby-fine, stick-straight hair, very long and very sensitive to products, like my skin. Anything rubbed into it post-shower gives me the mid-90's grunge look--in other words, I look oily and unshowered. And now off we go to Chili's for lunch. But in all honesty, I feel so relaxed, so much more like myself in civilian clothes and 85-degree temperatures, I don't really care that my face looks like a strawberry Moonpie and my hair looks like I don't care to wash it.  So there .

      Only three sentences could ruin my mood right now:  Right now: "Your flight's been cancelled."   In Qatar: "We ran out of space, here's your shelter half and a blankie, ma'am."  On returning: "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but your two kitties were buried by the snowplow in Sackets Harbor this morning."  Barring those three nightmare scenarios, nothing can take the smile off my face. This morning, I came in to discover that  once again , the Captain who works next to me crashed my SIPR computer, thereby shitcanning the Officer Evaluation Report Support Form I'd slaved over all day yesterday, because he's too lazy to walk four extra steps to the SIPR computer on the other desk. Which, by the way, we  put there   for People Other Than the Intelligence Officer to use. Translation: No one's really supposed to fuck around on my computer for exactly this reason.   BUT, I didn't even get mad. I asked him if the other computer was broken and left it at that. At least I printed the damn OER Support Form before he trashed it. And I type fairly quickly, so it's not the end of the world. Terribly inconsiderate and disrespectful on his part, as is often the case with this guy, but it is  not  personal or intentional and I know that. He's a man, they often don't mean anything by it.  New Year's Resolution #2, just behind I Resolve to Be Nicer to Weak Pansies and Lazy Ne'er-do-well's, is Don't Get Worked Up Over Dumb Shit. This one takes a conscious effort on my part. I don't think there is much in this world that is trivial, and I'll need to start making that distinction as a habit.  The gym this morning...I went at about 3 am, so it was blessedly empty. Nearly. A handful of Infantry types lifted weights, which provides those of us on the treadmills some much-appreciated eye candy. One in particular today had me cranking up the speed--bald and bulgy, looked to be about my age, one of those rare men who looks unbelievably sexy with the head shaved. He knew it, though, evidenced by slightly raised eyebrows, that little muscle-man strut with the arms carried out to the sides slightly more than is natural. Hence, Not My Type, not by a long shot. I overheard one of these overly confident bulgers make the comment during Officer Candidate School that he could have any woman he wanted. I laughed out loud.  I love watching the Alpha Male dynamic from my little perch on the treadmill, right next to the wall with all the posted admonishing signs:   Fitness is the Essence of Survival. Get tough or die. Pain is weakness leaving the body.   I guess we're supposed to look up mid-workout, feel chastised by the signs, and up the intensity.  I'm off to be a girl for four days. The plane leaves in exactly 3.5 hours. I likely won't post until next Wednesday, when I'm sure I'll be full of stories of big fish (caught and eaten), manicured hands and feet, and far too much rich food.  That's why they call it R&R, jack .

      Busy day. I bought a cheapie digital camera to take to Qatar...no way I'm going deep-sea fishing without a camera. Felt guilty for buying it for about 2.5 minutes--I already have one at home, much higher quality, but I didn't bring it because I'd need my computer to bring with it, and both things were too expensive. I figured I shouldn't bring anything here I could stand to lose or have filled with sand and dirt. I think it was a wise call. This one will serve my purposes here just fine.  America's Team  lost   Trivia Night! We relenquished our heavyweight title!! Major C had some wild questions, I don't know where he gets this stuff...but we had to contend one of the music snippet answers. He credited "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" to the Steve Miller Band...uh, that was Charlie Daniels, don't argue with a Southern lady about country music!   Truth be told, I don't know jimmywop about country music, but I know that song because when it came out in the fifth grade, we all rocked hard to it. If it ain't Patsy Cline or Johnny Cash, though, I probably don't know it. Wait, are Emmylou Harris and Lucinda Williams considered country?   And today Major C is sick, bedridden even. Sick men make me want to take care of them...maybe the redheaded Intel lady should bring the poor boy some chicken soup. But I don't have any chicken soup...wonder if chocolate has the same effect?  I did get confirmation today that I'm headed home in early February. My big concern now, is that I'm dreadfully out of shape...I train, but not to the level I do at home. Just not as motivated here. I'm not too concerned, though, I'll get it back in short order at home. I don't think I'm so bad off I'll fall out of the battalion's 9-minute-mile runs, but it will NOT be comfortable. I've got my work cut out for me, and a little time to get a head start on it here.  BUT NOT UNTIL NEXT WEDNESDAY! Qatar tomorrow! When I get back, I'll only have about three weeks left until I'm back in the Land of the Living.

      What the hell is this? This site keeps posting everything I write twice, even after I go back and delete one of the copies. Many apologies, know that I am aware of the issue but unable to adjust fire.  I just had an intense craving to wear my own goddamn clothes for awhile...oh, wait, I get to go to Qatar in two days. And shopping is part of the deal. I get to be a girl for four whole days. I think I'm growing tired of the Army life, finally. I still spend perhaps too much of my time on the job perusing the FBI's Special Agent Processing handbook. I have visions of myself as Agent Scully, only a bit more of a kick-the-door-in-and-throw-your-ass-to-the-floor gal rather than a chasing-aliens gal. Could be great therapy.

      It's literally 0º outside and I'm in my office dreading the hell out of going out there for formation in exactly twenty minutes. These Sappers, I should have known they'd want me standing tall for PT right off the plane.  I walked into my lovely pad at about 3 am two days ago to find the place turned upside down, but not disastrous. The kitties broke some things and there was hair everywhere. They'd pulled two rolls of toilet paper into the bathtub, shredded them, and somehow even dumped soap on the whole shitpile, a monument to their displeasure. I expected all this. I was only able to sleep about three hours, and the first thing I did was call a cleaning lady.   Her name's Marie, she's a strapping little country lady, and why I never thought of this before is beyond me. By 5pm, the place was returned to its tranquil, tidy former self. Marie even gave me the first hour free as a thank-you for deploying. It's cheaper than a message to have a cleaning lady and much better at reducing stress--I'm buying my free time, having her come over every Thursday. I spent yesterday nesting--buying plants and some new furniture, watching the last eight episodes of Sex and the City, and just generally lazing around my much-missed house reconnecting with friends and the two felines who regarded me with open suspicion when I opened the door on Wednesday.  All the drama when I left Afghanistan--not as bad as I'd catastrophized, as usual. The Colonel wasn't pissed, just wanted to know how CJ4 had gotten involved. I apologized, he understood, we shook hands, and I left. I also apologized to Sergeant Major, who said I hadn't done anything wrong and didn't owe anyone an apology...best to err on the side of caution at any rate.  I get two weeks of leave starting a week from Monday--I'm planning a big Montreal trip, some skiing, and general laziness. Delicious.

      I went to the Joint Operations Center, the big JOC, last Saturday night to support SGT B while she got a coin from the Commanding General. I ran into Major B, whom I'd known when he was CPT B and I was a Sergeant. We'd been deployed down to Colombia and he was one of the officers pushing me toward OCS. He remembers me perfectly, down to what I studied in school, and has been a great contact, great support.  He asked me how the deployment has gone for me. I was upset at my two supervisors (excluding the Colonel, absolutely, he's been a great mentor) for the slap in the face they dealt me that day...I won't get into it, but it was pretty astonishing, that they were this vengeful. The Colonel stopped them dead in their tracks, but the point was made. I won't get into it.   At any rate, I vented to Major B about how these two officers utterly failed in their supervisory role. And they did fail, beginning with Day One and only getting worse throughout the deployment, up to their failed attempt to blatantly stab me in the back. Major B, he doesn't like those guys anyhow, and got right pissed off as I told them about how it'd been since I got here. He got so pissed, he told the Sergeant Major he works with...who also has a Big Problem with these guys.   So imagine my surprise when the two of them came roaring up in an SUV yesterday, the CSM demanding to see our CSM...hollering and visibly pissed. About little old me.  Oh, shit. I fully intended to just redeploy, put it behind me, chalk it up to poor leadership skills among many officers in the Engineer branch. I certainly did not intend to Make It An Issue. I tried to stop that Sergeant Major, telling him I didn't want to make this trouble.  (Insert angry Southerner Sergeant Major voice here) "Goddamn it, Lieutenant, I know you don't want to make an issue of it. Which is why  I DO  want to make the issue. This is complete bullshit and I don't care if it's none of my business, I hear you're a hard-charger and I won't see you treated like that. Especially not by  those assholes ."  Oh, my. No one has said anything about it. I suspect it was kept between the Sergeant Majors, and that our Sergeant Major agreed wholeheartedly, but didn't want to get involved with officer business.   Well, I feel badly that Battalion business went outside school. I certainly did not intend anything to be DONE about it, I was just upset and Major B said all the right things to cool me off and give me the right perspective. I think that many men feel that things must be FIXED when a woman is upset about something. In reality, the venting fixes things to a certain extent already. Not that I'm entirely sorry it blew up. Maybe someone long-overdue for an asschewing got just that.   It's good to know there are people who are willing to go to bat for me, even though they aren't in my unit. I was surprised these guys felt the need to look out for me like that--I had just met that Sergeant Major, had the instant comfort-level I have with most overtly Southern soldiers, especially if they're loud and brash like I am. Major B gave me his contact information, with the instructions: "Let me know what happens."  I will pull our Sergeant Major aside as we're travelling tonight, explain how it all went down, apologize for getting him involved. I owe him that.  We leave Afghanistan in exactly twelve hours, headed to Germany. All the drama of the past two days has only made me more eager to fly out of here, leave this tainted experience behind. My two "supervisors" spoiled the whole experience for me--I will forever remember this deployment in the context of the Big Backstabbing, and what it taught me: trust your instincts (mine told me those two were snakes), don't assume it's your fault when your supervisor's a jackass, and there ARE officers out there who care enough to go out of their way to take care of you.

      I just deleted an entry before I'd even posted it. I'm getting better at this. It was a lugubrious tirade about The Butthole, who has been doing/saying things behind my back that can only be called sophomoric and unprofessional.   He's been dismissive of me and my contributions since I arrived, only speaks to me when he has to, has NO idea what I've done because he never TALKS to me...what kind of "supervisor" does this all add up to? Answer: a piss-poor one. And I've fought with the female tendency to think it's something I'VE done... it isn't . Not in this case.  I say shitty things behind his back, here in my weblog...NOT to supervisors, NOT to anyone in the work environment, NOT to anyone who knows him. I know better than that. He, evidently, does not.  How do I know it isn't me? Well, I had my Officer Evaluation Report and counseling with the Colonel. All  very  positive, and he is not a man to pull any punches. I point-blank asked him if there's anything I should work on, and he said, "No, nothing jumps out at me...you're easily one of the best Lieutenants in the Battalion."  BOO-yah!  The shoes: I was told this morning that we could leave tomorrow, so I went directly to my hooch and started packing...I was pissed off at The Butthole anyway, it was a good idea to exit the office before I unloaded on him with both barrels (verbally, of course, don't contact the General and have my rifle taken away!).  I decided several days ago to toss both pairs of running shoes I brought--I've pounded the crap out of them, they're filthy, and I have two brand-new pairs waiting for me at home. I ordered them online and had them delivered so they'd be waiting for me.  We have three Haji's here on a work detail for the Battalion. I brought them a large bag of food and the two pairs of shoes. They completely ignored the food and went straight for the shoes, arguing loudly over who gets them. One guy, he sat down on the ground right there, removed his falling-apart pair, put mine on, and walked his old ones right over to the dumpster, grinning and laughing all the while. The other one with holes in his shoes, he got the other pair. They both wear them now.  One of them, the first one to take a pair by force, now stands on the porch just outside the window, grinning at me, dancing around in his new shoes, saying,  "My friend! You my friend!"   I can't believe they fit these guys--I have small feet, even for a girl.

      I slept in this morning, sandbagged PT, showered, and retrieved my rifle from the pile of laundry I'd leaned it against. On my way to the office, some guy stopped walking in the other direction, openly staring at me. "What the hell's  his  problem?" I sat at my desk and took the weapon off my shoulder...and there, dangling from the end of the rifle, were a dirty t-shirt and a pair of blue panties from my laundry stack. Christ.  We had a SSI-FWS ceremony--Shoulder Sleeve Insignia, Former Wartime Service. It means we now wear the "combat patch," or the 10th Mountain crossed-swords, on our right shoulders as well as on the left. It's a priviledge restricted to those who've served in an active combat zone, and you are entitled to wear it the rest of your military career. Those of us leaving next week also received our service awards...Army Commendation Medal in my case, my fifth one. But it's special--my first combat award.   I didn't sleep well last night at all--another noisy night on the airfield. I am counting the hours until I leave this place.

      Now I understand why SGT B got so worked up over the Korean MRE's...they are  amazing . I have pledged not to touch chowhall food until I leave in favor of these space-age, pre-packaged meals. Open the thick ziplock baggie, pull out all the little packets--toasted sesame oil, peanut oil, that red spicy powder they put on everything in Korea, and generic M&M's. Pour boiling water in, add all the seasonings (minus the M&M's of course), reseal the bag, wait ten minutes...better than anything else here. Rice, vegetables, some kind of tofu pellets, and the little slices of very fishy dried fish I have to pick out before adding the water.  Nasty!   In Korea, I constantly picked things out of my food. I went to a Korean restaurant in Uijongbu with Jerry, my summertime fling. It was July, and brutally hot. Korea smells dreadful in the summertime--a symphony of human waste, rotting fish, industrial flotsam, decaying rodents, whatever.  We sat at the table, each speaking just enough Korean to get there. There was a wok-thing in the center. A smiling older gentleman brought out the raw food, dumped it into the wok, stirred it up, and walked away. I tore my eyes off Jerry long enough to check out the ingredients.  "Um, what's this?" I nudged a plump, brown...how to describe these things? It was the pupa of a silkworm, highly prized in Korean food. I don't eat bugs. Ever. And these looked directly like something off Fear Factor.  "Oh, it's those silkworms," Jerry noted, amused at my squeamishness. He ate one right then and there. I heard it crunch and squirt as he chewed it.  I proceeded to pick them all out, sequestering them to the edge of the wok. I siezed the opportunity to show off my chopstick dexterity, plucking them nimbly from the mix and over to their new mass grave. I selected a large cabbage leaf and ceremoniously covered them up.  "I'm putting them to bed. I can't eat looking at those sumbitches." I patted their new blanket with feigned, exaggerated reverence. Jerry laughed. He'd eaten dog once and a small, live octopus while I watched in horror in the market. He let the legs kick and squirm outside his mouth while I swore total celibacy until he brushed his teeth, twice.  It was pure machismo. This was Jerry. He'd been a door-gunner before reclassing to MI. Think  Apocalpse Now.   Presently, the kind-faced Korean waiter returned with a large, slotted spoon. He stirred up our meal with big, grand gestures. The worms, they went right back in the mix. That damn Jerry, he gleefully stared at me, grinning widely across the wok as I smiled tightly at the waiter, trying to be polite. As soon as he left, I picked them back out and put them in a napkin, threatening to wipe the floor with them if Jerry was tempted to eat them.  These MRE's, minus the nasty fishy fish, are incredibly tasty. I'm eating one a day--half for lunch, half for dinner. Somehow SGT B, with all her shouting and mistreatment of our Korean partners, scored a case of them. Koreans are very kind and generous people, for the most part. Some of the younger ones like to toss Molitov cocktails at us and violently protest outside our bases in Korea, but they are almost without exception college students. Must be a right of passage.

      You know you're bored when you spend several hours meticulously cutting the Australian Major out of a photo in which he holds our battalion colors (that's our flag), and pasting the image on the Moon, at the Washington Monument, in the French Revolution. We've printed these out and distributed them widely. And they're on email. It's great fun.  I've been tasked with taking photos of each soldier holding the colors with a bucolic mountain backdrop. This will then be framed with some hua little caption, "Operation Enduring Freedom, 2003-2004," something like this. A great idea. But the weather, it is NOT cooperating. You can't even SEE the bucolic mountain backdrop. And I leave in a week. This tasking came from the Battalion Commander, and what kind of a jackass can't execute this mission? If I can't get these damn pictures taken, I am a miserable failure as an officer.   So out of frustration, I took a gorgeous landscape I shot last week, crisp view with fresh snow, and pasted the unfortunate Australian Major's likeness, hoping to create a believable portrait despite this shitty weather. It looked like something out of a 1960's sci-fi flick--downright comical. Which is how the cut-and-paste-to-moonscape-with-Buzz-Aldren frenzy began. MAN I need to figure out how to post pictures to this site.  Hell, it killed a couple of hours.

      The Division ran aerial gunneries all night long. Loud explosions, large-caliber machine gun fire, birds taking off and landing...several concerned citizens knocked on my door and asked if they should go to the bunker. The thing about rockets and cannon fire, there's no way to distinguish between ours and theirs. I completely understand why these guys would think perhaps we were under attack.  The bed shook all night, and not in a good way. The planes, they were so close that at one point, I halfway awoke to the sound of a just-airborn jet, and through the earplugs it sounded exactly like I was actually ON the plane. You know, that low humming just as you've lifted off, the flight attendants are just beginning to move about, and you lean your head against the window, anticipating a long nap.  So I dreamed I was on the flight home, initially. The dream then shifted to my front porch--I stood in front of my door, about to reach for the handle when I noticed a fat electrical cable snaking up to the knob. I knew in the way that you know things in dreams that the FBI was pissed off about something I'd said or done and they were trying to kill me.   "Ha!" I thought. "You can't get an ex-33 this way!" I cut the fat cable, sparks flew, and I walked into the house unharmed.   Except that there were four cups of hot coffee on the kitchen counter. I started to write them a note:    Gentlemen-- Whatever I'm doing that's pissing you off, I'll stop. Just tell me what it is.  Yours,  Kristen   I heard bumping and shifting around in the kitchen pantry. "Hey, I'm just writing you guys a note! Come on out and let's discuss this!" Somehow, I wasn't afraid.  They rolled out of the closet. Amends were made. We shook hands and they finished their coffee, complimenting me on its quality.

      This is my favorite time of the whole day--after the daily Ops meeting, everyone goes to chow. But since I eat a big bowl of oatmeal in the hooch every morning, I stay here and enjoy the relative quiet. It's the only time I can count on reading emails and making blog entries in private.  Yesterday the Compound held a farewell barbeque for the Koreans. I spent a year in Korea, and so did SGT B, my roommate. I opted for a Korean MRE, complete with kimchee and hot sauce...I do miss that food. SGT B sat down next to me and a Korean Captain. He did not speak any English. I nodded to him and said, "Anyung-ha sayo," the standard greeting. SGT B asked him if he had any extra MRE's. He laughed nervously and nodded, clearly not understanding a word.  Here's where it got annoying. SGT B started yelling, as if he just hadn't heard her, and assumed the badly-executed accent of a Korean who doesn't speak English, as if he'd better understand it that way, leaving out most of the verbs. "YOU HAVE MRE? YOU GIVE ME MRE?" Eyes wide, shouting, nodding.  Holy shit it was annoying. It was probably downright insulting to him. The poor guy, he just stared at his plate, nodding and pretending to understand. She just got louder and more incoherent.  I reached over and touched his elbow, asked him quietly, "Do you speak any English?" He shook his head. At which time I said, "Stop yelling at him. He doesn't speak English!" She thought it was funny. I, however, did not.  It would not be the only annoying conversation I'd have inside of an hour. A Lieutenant Colonel I've never liked from our higher headquarters stood behind me making very unsportsmanlike remarks about our trivia team. You know, the one with five players, three of whom were new privates, to their team of ten with six field grade officers? Stan and I were the only ones answering questions. We knew we'd get creamed.  I gave him the Evil Eye over my shoulder, continued eating. He then stated, loudly, "Yeah, we National Guard used to worry that we couldn't cut it on deployment with you Active Duty, but now we just laugh because you couldn't hack it in the REAL world."  I was FURIOUS!! Rank be damned!! I spun around and sputtered, "Sure, sir, because God knows the ability to gather and retain useless information is THE best indicator of success! Shit, be sure you put that on your resume'!"   So, according to this jackass, we're only Active Duty because we're too stupid to be civilians! I have not one doubt in my mind that I could walk into a civilian job and just  kick ass , because this is HARDER than the "REAL" world.   And secondly, how is that even relevant? I'm not in  your  world, buddy, you're in MINE. What you do as a civilian, your so-called "REAL" job, means  nothing  over here! I couldn't care less if you're a civil engineer, you're still overweight in your uniform, you can't run a half-mile, and you had to spend two days MDMPing  guard duty , for chrissakes.  What I found so offensive about that exchange, is that I don't drive that wedge between Active Duty and Guard/Reserves. I never comment on the differences, I don't treat them any differently than I do my own soldiers. I treat them according to individual merits, or lack thereof. The only times I've ever heard nasty remarks, they've come from Guard/Reserves, not Active Duty. Sounds like  they're  the ones with the complex, not us.  Get over it, folks. Last I checked, we're on the same side.

      I went back and deleted yesterday's post--it was All About Politics. And really, politics just are not very  interesting , you know? I have concluded that people believe what they believe despite any amount of evidence, so why create hard feelings arguing about it? You won't change my mind, I won't change yours, so what exactly is the point? I bite my tongue in the office all the time--I'm one of the Army's only Democrats, and  I'm not sorry !   I have very solid reasons for feeling the way I do about the issues, but I usually just say, "We'll just have to agree to disagree," and leave it at that. I used to get all impassioned, pound my fist, defend my position to the end--but to WHAT end? When the time comes, I quietly vote the way I vote, and that's all the action I need to take, ever. Leave the pissing matches to the pundits.  We had mad Valentine's Day Trivia Night...our team was called My Dad Can Beat Up Your Dad, but no one's dad got beaten up last night. We also only had five players, and the winning team had eleven...more people, more right answers, because  someone's bound to know something!    I am happy to report that I can name every single country in Central America, without delay: Belize, Honduras, Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Grenada, Nicaragua. The capital of Guyana is Georgetown. Lewis Carroll wrote Through the Looking Glass. Geography, literature, history, art, I am the Woman. Modern music? I'm a miserable failure. I don't know Everclear from ass.  I couldn't answer many movie questions, either...I don't watch most movies that come out, because most of them look so stupid that I can't see wasting the two hours I'll never get back. I think I got the one about Ocean's Eleven since I'll watch anything with that much man-candy.   I did just watch Seabiscuit in my hooch--very uplifting, nice little movie. I'm okay losing two hours on that one. Besides, between now and when I get on the plane to the U.S. in two weeks, every single one of these hours is completely expendable. Here, have one.

      Changed the title of the blog to reflect the fact that soon, it will NOT be the "Aghanistan Private Blog." I won't be in Afghanistan, and I don't think it's particularly private, so I release it.  Fly and be free!!

      Two of our guys were on patrol with the infantry unit they're attached to, and wandered slightly off the road near Ghazni...and hit a landmine. Not just any landmine, an Anti-Tank, which is about like hitting a medium-sized bomb. One dead from the infantry, four wounded, including a Private and a Specialist from our battalion. They're okay, just shaken and bruised up--they wore the right protective gear and even had Kevlar blankets in the vehicle.  The Private sat in Battalion Headquarters this morning. I walked in and said, "Hey, Junior, how are you feeling? Are you okay?"  He shook his head and looked at me. "Ma'am, I feel like I called Mike Tyson a sissy."   He'll be okay.

      I'm seized with a perverse compulsion to shout these words in Command and Staff at a dead run on the way out the door, just to hear the chairs clatter to the floor, tables overturn, curses and death threats. It's a raw nerve around here.  See, we had this battalion commander before the current benign dynasty, he was one of those people you wish you outranked so you could tell him to  Just Shut Up for Chrissakes . "Climb to Glory" is the Division Commander's motto--he's a 2-star General. "On Point" was a speech by the Army Chief of Staff, the highest ranking uniformed member of the U.S. Army. This last guy, a Lieutenant Colonel, he appropriated both pieces and insisted the Staff brand this new, plagerized motto on every memorandum, every Powerpoint slide, every office sign in the battalion. He would publicly humiliate anyone who failed to include both it and his nickname (probably self-appointed), "Rock," on any correspondence internal or external to the battalion. When our current commander took control, he eliminated it immediately and received a standing ovation on doing so.   It became a big joke...someone welded the offending motto to our last S-3's parking space marker, and much merriment ensued.  Our unfortunate Signal Officer, he didn't know about The Rock. He designed our webpage to read "On Point for the Climb to Glory" across the top. The head of our benign dynasty, he was appalled. While the discussion took place here in the headquarters, Chief slipped out, went next door, and told the Sigo to change it,  quick!  Moments later, I hit refresh on the webpage, and it read only "Climb to Glory." Whew!  The things we get worked up about in here. Earlier, there was a heated discussion on the subject of wooden bullets, were they truth or fiction? Personally, I couldn't care less. But Stan, the one with whom I debated at length about whether rugs as such were invented vs. discovered, insisted the wooden bullets were a myth. It was swiftly pointed out that Stan had just yesterday argued for the existence of Sasquatch in the mountains around our airbase, but he can't swallow the concept of a wooden bullet? I then suggested that Stan and Chief go get into the Scooby Doo van and go sniff out ole Bigfoot up there on the slopes. Take some snowskis and play James Bond with Johnny Taliban. That got a big laugh.   Stan and Chief are both flying home with us. I want us all to sit together, and those two need to be right up by the pilot. We won't stop for anything if the guy in charge has to listen to Stan's craziness...HIGH entertainment value.   If you didn't know Stan, you'd think he was about four asshairs away from the looney bin.  The other main discussion of the day centered around lunch, and  Maybe they'll have the little pizzas!  We love the little pizzas, we don't understand why they only serve them once a month or so. We plead with them, please bring us little pizzas! It falls on deaf ears. Another dish we wish to see more of is spaghetti. Simple, humble spaghetti, one of the easiest entrees on the planet to prepare. No one can screw up spaghetti! Boys, just open up a can of mater sauce, boil some water, you're there!!   DAMMIT!! I have twice gone back and deleted that post that's on here twice, and it keeps popping back up!  What do I have to do??

      I just received confirmation that I will lead 10th Mountain Division's first ever UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) platoon. Which is exactly what I wanted...reference an earlier post when I was pulling every string I had available to get this platoon. Remember last year in the news when a little spy plane in Yemen launched a Hellfire missile into a truckload of terrorists, effectively rendering them dead as dogshit? That was a Predator UAV. I think we're getting Hunter, a slightly smaller version, but same idea...little remote-controlled drone flying around with a high-powered camera, spying on bad guys. Great shit. They're building the facilities out at the airfield now...so I get a new office, the soldiers have started showing up one by one, and the UAV's themselves will follow eventually.  Rachel sent me a box of Mardi Gras goodies. The S-2 section is now decked out in purple, green, and gold.

      Call me a whiner. I don't buy that ideal of "You're in a combat zone! It's supposed to suck!" bullshit leadership philosophy. I think that's just laziness, a lack of will for fixing what can be fixed. In any situation, if you CAN make something better without compromising mission effectiveness, why wouldn't you? Our heat, or lack thereof, in the tent--I knew it could be fixed, so I called KBR again last night.  These two old guys showed up. I told them the short version of the history of our damn heat. They shook their heads and said it was that damn "Phase Two Power" issue. So, rather than get pissed, jump up and down, and make an Issue of it, I just asked, very sweetly, "But you  could  fix it, right? I won't tell."   Old Guy scratched his head and said, "We haven't been given authorized to change the power over...but I guess I could hook you up. I won't tell if you won't." Five minutes later, we had nice, warm air flowing from the vent. I got the guy's name--Vern, if you can believe it--and promised I'd send home-baked brownies and cookies when I get home in two weeks.   That is a promise I will keep. And I make a  mean  batch of brownies, jack.

      Hmm. Amazing. The Belly's already shrinking, with a satisfying swiftness. I'm back to my pre-Afghanistan weight, and at this rate will reach pre-Drum weight before I get home. NICE.  In the absence of direct supervision via a visible PT formation, these guys will use any little event as justification to roll over and pull the fartsack up higher, skip PT altogether. Today the lights were off in the showers, so they didn't do PT, rationalizing that they wouldn't want to stink all day. Fair enough, I suppose, but it wouldn't kill them to do some push-up/sit-up improvement. I work out on my own, absurdly early, so I didn't even know they'd sandbagged it until I got back to the hooch, flipped the lights on, and was met with loud protest. I showered in the dark.  I have one soldier here, an E5 who made it through Special Forces Selection...so I don't worry about his fitness. One joe, whom I'll call Junior, is slated for PLDC (Primary Leadership Development Course, school to become a Sergeant for you civvies out there) when we get back, and I'm concerned for him despite the fact that he's not my soldier. See, I'm female and not incredibly fast--respectable, I don't fall out of formations EVER, but not winning any weekend footraces--and I smoke the guy. And I must admit that it rankles the shit out me when I pass him and he's making that whining,  "This is too FAST"  sound. You know the one, the little whine on exhale....Huuuuh, huuuuh, huuuuh. Bitch, please. He reasons that it's because he's "old." At thirty-two, he's a year younger than I am. Should I be additionally insulted by the Grandma implication?  No, not really. I like Junior just fine, even though I call him Eyore in my mind. I just don't get it when a tall, skinny guy like that can't keep a ten-minute mile. He'll figure it out. PLDC is a total cakewalk--physically, mentally, all of it. Even Junior can handle it. And the rest of them, if they sandbag PT every day, the best thing I can do is keep my mouth shut, let the NCO chain handle it, and keep smoking myself daily, thereby Leading By Example.

      That last posting has a comment by someone named SG...I'm racking my brain trying to figure out who this person is, and how he/she heard about my weblog.  Not that I mind , of course, I just didn't think it was interesting enough for a stranger to enjoy.  So SG asks if I have any tips for someone deploying to Afghanistan for a six-month stint. So here goes:  1)  If you don't already love to read, learn to love it. Bring books, Amazon delivers here (books, but not much else, for some reason ) have your buddies send current magazines (I'm a religious Runner's World and New Yorker fan--the PX carries Runner's World, but I'm probably the Only Soldier in the U.S. Army to read The New Yorker. And  I'm not sorry! ). I used to think I was also the Army's only Democrat, but I work with two others. My take on my politics: I've been a soldier for five years, and female for thirty-three...George Dub-ya has deployed the CRAP out of us and completely decimated reproductive rights, so I ask: What has he done for  me  lately? Or, EVER? Ok, I digress...I do that a lot, in case you've not noticed.  2)  Become very adept at biting your tongue. Pick your battles wisely, they WILL be remembered on redeployment. And yes, this coming from the poor slob who got hugely pissed over cookies...in my own defense, I didn't lose my temper, I don't think anyone (besides Major K, my vent buddy) even  knew  I was hugely pissed over cookies.  3)  You know that black bearsuit thing, the wonderful fleece jacket they issue you but tell you not to wear?  Bring it . Unless something changes, it's authorized for wear with PT's, and roundabout October it gets mighty chilly around here.  4)  Websites that will greatly improve your quality of life, if you're into Nice Things:   www.drugstore.com www.netgrocer.com www.roadrunnersports.com  They all deliver over here. It's amazing what a big bottle of expensive Philosophie Pumpkin Pie-scented shower gel will do for your spirits. I procured it just before Thanksgiving and annoyed the crap out of the other ladies in the shower by standing there with a handful of it, eyes closed, smiling, and sniffing happily. It smells  just like   its namesake.   Netgrocer, great for food compatible with microwave and hot pot. You will get so sick of that damn chow hall, you won't even want to put yourself through the trouble of walking 500 yards to it.   You'll wear out your running shoes on the rocks, so Roadrunner is a great source--they have everything. Oh, and Victoria's Secret. A girl's gotta have pretty underthings, even in a combat zone.  5)  Buy nice, soft earplugs if you're coming to Bagram. The airfield stays maddeningly busy all night, every night, with every flavor of aircraft taking off and landing constantly, and I could hit them with a rock from my back door. The yellow foam ones and God forbid, those horrid rubber things the Army gives you? Not good enough. Look at the decibel ratings on the packages at the drugstore. The kind I found are light green, very comfortable, and block out 33 decibels of sound. Doesn't stop the bunk from rattling violently as the Chinooks hover  right over your head , but they definitely help.  6)  If you have a personal computer with games and a DVD player, bring it. The bazaar (if it ever comes back) sports a huge collection of pirated DVD's, muy cheapo. I even found the first season of  Six Feet Under  for ten bucks.  Can't think of anything else. I think the boredom is the toughest part, and that depends on your job. OH, bring a lamp! Clamp on, whatever. They don't sell them at the PX and you WILL want one! Shit, one more thing--if they don't issue you the WileyX goggle-glasses things, you'll want those, too. If you come here in May, that's the beginning of the Winds of 120 Days. No shit. Think mad, gale-force sandstorms every day for months on end, lovingly accompanied by 110+ degree heat. This is summer in Afghanistan. You'll think you landed on Mars.  Get outside the wire every chance you get. Think the Bible meets Apocalypse Now...camels and donkeys, mud huts, burqas against a backdrop of bombed out tanks and wrecked Russian MIG's. Unreal. It doesn't look anything like any other place on Earth, I'm convinced.

      Happily, I'm leaving before March 8, even. We could be wheels-up anywhere from February 26-March 3, and that March 3 one is the  latest  we're outta here.  This is what's bound to happen when you get lucky enough to travel with the Sergeant Major. See, it's like a club, much more powerful than those wierdo Free Masons, you can only be a member if you are a Sergeant Major in the U.S. Army, and it means that when you want something, folks hand it over to you with a smile. Thus, I have no worries whatsoever about leaving here. I know in my heart it'll happen when scheduled, or even earlier.  The truck starts right up, I'm told. Darling Rachel went and got the gargantuan stack of my mail. As for the house and the gorgeous new furniture, the curtains, etc, all at the mercy of two very young and very bored felines, I can only hope it'll be okay. The curtains will be easy enough to replace, but the furniture? Oh, my.  The other mess I was worried about, my office in the rear, I'm not so sure about. I emailed my new Assistant S-2, a brand-new Lieutenant, asking questions about two clearances. This was three days ago, and it's something we cannot do here. We have to rely on the rear detachment for this type thing. I haven't heard a word back, which  directly  pisses me off. I wouldn't go home until I'd answered any questions from the deployed folks when I was in the rear. It sounds like this guy is utterly  on his ass . I sent a very direct email explaining the rear-forward relationship. Well, another bad first impression, both ways this time.   I don't much care if he thinks I'm a bitch. He should do his damn job! He only has about an hour's worth of work back there every day, so the very idea that he didn't fix what I'd asked him to is just outrageous.

      I was much amused in Germany to realize that I could prop my magazine on my big belly while lying on the bed. It has gotten entirely too big. Most days, I don't think about it and it doesn't bother me--after all, I'm still running well and my clothes fit. For the most part anyway. But at Le Meridien in Munich, I took the only bath I've had since October, and there was  no denying it.  Girl got a big fluffy belly. Its days are numbered.  However, I was much encouraged in the gym in Landstuhl--I got on the treadmill at sea level and started running at 6.0, or a pedestrian 10:00 pace. This is how sluggish I am here at 6000 feet--I would be embarassed to run that pace at home, and here my heart rate at Bagram hits 180 bpm almost immediately.   10:00 pace...okay, I'm not breathing hard. 9:00...huh, I'm still not breathing hard. I'll stick here for ten minutes, see if it catches up to me. Ummm, no, still not feeling it. 8:30...OK, the first indications of exertion. 8:00--now we're talking. Or not talking, because now I'm actually having to work at it. So I stuck at an 8:00 pace for over 45 minutes and felt fabulous at the end of it.  Holy SHIT. That altitude training is no joke! I can't normally maintain 8-minute-miles for more than two or three miles, and that's  really  pushing it, I'm trying hard not to fall out or throw up or both. I was so worried I'd show up at Drum unable to hang in the 9:00, 5-6 mile formation runs, and it's a load off my mind to know it won't be an issue.  Now, if only The Belly were an altitude-induced illusion...

      Something I left out of my rant about that Mouthy Bitch I'd made the mistake of travelling with: in my desire to seem like a nice person, I failed to mention that I dumped her in the middle of Munich. Cut the slingload on that dead weight and walked away, after handing her the train ticket and the map. I just could not waste another precious moment of my one day in Munich listening to all that blah blah blah. Sometimes, you just have to be selfish.  The takeaway from the entire ordeal: Trust Thine Instincts. And mine were shouting at me on first meeting her,  Get Away! Run Far Away!  I've been so conditioned to think that being judgemental is a glaring fault...I see that it can also be an asset, and that I should listen to it always, and act on it when appropriate.  I was just informed that all the crap I'd left in my desk back at Drum--the usual girly assortment of nail polish, lotion, my personal paperwork, etc--was all strewn all over the top of the desk. So someone went in there and cleaned out MY desk, and I'm guessing it was the E7 who came in right after I left. I will be out for someone's  ass  when I get back, believe me. The very idea that someone felt it was their place to clean out my desk, when there was never any question I'd be back and in that same position, and then to just throw everything on the desktop...that is just beyond belief. It was my NCO, he'll get a bad first impression of me, because I'll jump all up and down on him for that shit.  OK, Angry Girl has left the building. I am admittedly very territorial, and I do NOT like my shit being screwed up, EVER. Not in my house, not in my office, not on a train, not on a plane, Sam I Am Green Eggs and Ham.

      Two pieces of happy news on my return...I'm redeploying on March 8, and the heat in my tent works (at least nominally).  What shall I DO until March 8? In my sudden absence, my NCO took over my duties completely, and now I'm left surfing the net all day instead of just after lunch. There's only so much I can do, webwise, before it gets just brutally dull. I think I'll start sneaking out for catnaps and hooch-cleaning/packing.  So the tent--it may just be that's it's been relatively warm. I don't care what dynamic plays out there, I was just very very happy to walk into the warm tent last night.  We have two new lieutenants here--I just met them this morning. One's a prior-enlisted OCS guy, which like Southerners, instantly endears him to me. The other's a First Lieutenant and they both seem easy to get along with. Even still, I'm bored to death already.  And I'm a bit apprehensive about returning home--will my truck start? How destroyed is my home with two lonely kitties in residence for four months? Will they let me take the assload of leave I need? How hosed up is my mail situation?

      Remember that Hee-Haw song?  It's 5:25 am, I'm in civilian clothes, and the guy at the desk just told me he didn't find me on the manifest for the bus going to Frankfurt and on to Afghanistan. I can only figure that the nice men at the liason office hosed it up. Thing is, now I'm all packed, and I didn't sleep last night BECAUSE:   Both my roommates snore like wooly mammoths . I mean, it was just unbelievable. Normally, I wear earplugs to drown them out--wouldn't even have worked last night--but I didn't want to miss my alarm this time. It's not that I'm eager to get back to that hellhole, but now I'm packed up, ready, and sleep-deprived enough to guarantee an unconscious busride or planeride, if that's to happen today.   And that stomach nastiness I got on arrival in Afghanistan is back, with a fierceness. I can't eat, it's too hot in here, everything pisses me off, and I'm forcing myself to be polite. And I  am  being polite, really.  Back to the cold tent. Back to SGT B turning the damn light on in the middle of the night for no evident reason. Back to the same food every day. Back to the 250-meter sprint to the toilets. Back to the ubiquitous darkness (Bagram is almost completely unlit at night, black as the bitch's brew). Back, worst of all, to the abiding boredom. This was a lovely distraction, even when you throw in that self-absorbed wench.  And wouldn't it just be a damn shame if I got stuck in Frankfurt?

      By a sudden and bizarre twist of fate, I ended up in Germany this week. I'm at a strange little Army base in Kaiserslautern, a charming little city near the French border. I've been here since last Wednesday night, after eleven hours on a C-17. I was violently ill the entire flight and utterly drained of energy when I got here.  Not now, though.  I awoke early Saturday morning, having completed my suicidal-soldier escort duties, and decided to take the train to Munich. I booked a five-star hotel in the middle of the city via internet, packed a huge rucksack (planning to run, had to bring running shoes, etc.), and was on my way out the door when one roommate stirred. Kris, whom I instinctively didn't care for on first meeting her. It's that air of superiority, it's written all over her face. She wears a Superior Little Smirk. I figured, maybe it's just a defense, she's probably okay.   "Where are you going?"  Me: "Munich."  "Want some company?"  Actually, NO, I didn't. But wishing to be polite, I said, "Uh, sure!" That was my first mistake.  That Air of Superiority, the Superior Little Smirk I was so quick to chalk up to my own judgemental nature? I was  right on the money , jack. I knew I'd screwed this up for myself the minute we set off--later than I'd intended, so I was already a bit peeved. As we walked toward the front gate, it was game on.  Let the insufferable boasting begin!    I'll address it by theme. First, it was I'm the Best Leader of Soldiers in the Army, and All Soldiers Bow Down to My Very Presence. Then, it was The Active Army is Far Inferior to the Weekend Warriors, and oh by the way, we're only Active Duty because we couldn't get  real  jobs. Then, it was I'm Taking a Huge Paycut to Go to Iraq, Where We Suffer So Much More Than Anyone Else. Embedded in this one was the question, "Oh, are we  still in  Afghanistan? I didn't realize that." (Insert insufferable little sniff here.)   Then, just when I'd reached the point of wishing her dead and had given up arguing all her bullshit and had resigned myself to the utter misery of her company, and had for hours been avoiding all eye contact and only answered with, "Mmm, mm-hmm, yyyeeaahh," she launched on We Are Bitter Towards the Active Army Because We Had To Live In Barracks For Six Weeks. She had the nerve to argue that all the junior-enlisted Active Army should be moved into the open-bay, shithole barracks alotted the Guard/Reserve Mobilization facilities (because they are TEMPORARY, for Chrissakes), on a permanent basis because it's just not right for a lieutenant to live with privates for those six weeks.   I basically called her an idiot. Which she is.   And for all her hardcore talk, PITIFULLY out of shape. I walked as quickly as was comfortable, hoping to either lose her or make her shut up, and she was smoked, couldn't keep up. I almost succeeded in losing her, but then felt bad because I had the train tickets.  I tuned her out completely and enjoyed the lovely Munich anyway. I'll write more when there is time, as someone hovers behind me waiting to use this station.

      There is a brand-new lieutenant taking over my current position in about a month...and given the decidedly unfruitful housing market in the area right now, she's also taking my apartment as I move into the House I Own. She hasn't even seen the apartment yet...but I can absolutely understand where she's coming from. She's seen only crappy apartments, just like I saw during my househunt. Folks in this area just aren't very aesthetically oriented. They're beauty-challenged. Not the locals as people, cosmetically (although no one in the Army looks to the locals for lovin', it's decidedly slim pickins)...the homes. The apartments. They're just awful. There's still a great deal of panelling and dark carpet out there.  Except mine. I'll actually miss it, my pretty little apartment in my pretty little harbor town. I'm sure the joys of ripping up nasty carpet and painting over pink grossness will get me past missing the old place in short order.  I submitted an initial application to the FBI. I want to see that it's a solid possibility before I go submitting any paperwork to separate from the Army. I don't think I'll make the move unless it's for the FBI--the last thing I want is to find myself out on the civilian job market, even with my skills and marketability. Uncertainty, I don't need, AT ALL...been there, done that, never going back.  We have an NBC range today...entailing the following: ride out to a sealed building, spend about three hours putting on a chemical mask over and over again, then go inside the building, breathe in some riot gas until you're covered in snot and drool and vomiting all over the floor, put the mask back on, exit. Sound like a monstrous pain in the ass? It is. Then tomorrow we have a grenade range...get a bunch of fake grenades, sprint around on a course throwing them into bunkers and over little walls while someone shouts at you to get the lead out, repeat four or five times until any motivation you might have had is long gone and you're exhausted beyond redemption. And in my case, so sore the next day that Physical Training is excruciating.  At least for now I'm spared the ultimate in pointless, painful training, the Bayonet Range. I've never even  heard  of anyone affixing a bayonet to their rifle in modern times. We prefer to SHOOT the rifles, not use them as great big knives. The unit went through a Bayonet Range last year, and the entire time I tried to appear like a motivated leader while thinking,  Jesus, this is the stupidest shit I've ever seen . And true to the Army doctrine I like to call Make Everything as Miserable as Possible, you're forced to lowcrawl through a pit of slushy, slimy bilge that smells like dead fish, bayonet/rifle in hand. And you're supposed to holler, "Kill Kill Kill What makes the grass grow green...GUTS GUTS GUTS." I'm not kidding. And at the end of it all, you've ruined a uniform and will spend the next two weeks scrubbing your kevlar helmet and flak jacket of the filth you've ground into it with your full body weight.  I think I've just grown irrevocably uninterested in all this crap. I'm sure machine guns and grenades are exciting for a 20-year-old guy, but I only participate because I have to. The fact is, I hate this shit, the "soldier skills." I haven't touched a grenade since basic training and have a very difficult time imagining a scenario in which I would deploy one...if your intelligence officer is throwing grenades, you have lost the fort and you're all gonna die. I know, I know, we're all soldiers first and individually skilled in our jobs second...but I can't help having completely lost interest.   I am, however, still very interested in the intelligence work. Which contributes to my gut feeling that it's time to think about leaving the Army in search of greener pastures. The direction the Army's moving is toward more and more of the kind of training I so detest.

      Okay, I'm having to resubmit this entry--had to delete it entirely after it published twice. So now it's a bit out of sequence, but here goes...  I walked into Sears last night after work because the tires I'd just had put on seemed to wobble. The effect was strong enough I could hear loose change rattling in the cupholder. There was no one behind the counter, so I stepped five feet to the right in order to check out a nice barbecue grill (which I bought), over a hundred bucks off on sale. I chatted with the salesman and noticed an older woman come in and stand at the counter. The salesman noticed, too. He got on the store phone to the mechanics.  "Flora, there's a lady out here in military uniform, she was actually here first."   But that lady who walked in behind me, she was not having it. She proceeded to assault the poor counter person with her conviction that her new tire had a broken belt. Another mechanic had told her so. The counterlady took her keys and left us all standing there...another man had come in behind her. He had a kind look to him. Pushy Woman looked at the American flag on my uniform, sewn (with much trouble on my part--I had to keep ripping it off and recentering it) just underneath my combat patch.  "Why is your flag backwards?" It is backwards, the stars and stripes live on the right side as you're looking at it. But the way she asked it, she clearly thought I'd just sewn it on wrong. When did I tatoo the red letters spelling IDIOT on my forehead?  Me: "You know, I don't know, but I'm sure there's a reason."  She rolled her eyes, "After 23 years in the Air Force, I can tell you there's not always a reason. It's probably a mistake." !!! Here's where I stopped trying to be polite.  "I can tell you that IN THE ARMY, when it comes to uniforms or customs and courtesies or  The Flag , there is ALWAYS a reason. WE actually have three hundred years of history that come through in various ways." My tone was downright nasty. Meanwhile, an Infantry Captain walked in.  She sniffed. "They're probably made in China and once they ordered them, they couldn't make it right."  Me: "Do you really think the Army is that STUPID?" I looked to the others for support. The Captain raised his eyebrows as if to ask what the trouble was. I gestured toward her. "This lady thinks we all put the flags on backwards BY MISTAKE. As if 300,000 soldiers are all complete imbeciles."  Infantry Captain: "Actually, it's 'backwards' because as you're charging forward into battle, that's how it would look on the flagpole. The stripes are always forward...you'll never see it from behind, because we never retreat. It's NOT an accident."  Me: "Thank you! I just hadn't heard the reason yet. But I knew there was one."  Pushy Bitch: "Well, in the Air Force, they just put things on the uniform without much reason."  Me: "Well, the Air Force doesn't have three hundred years of tradition dictating these things."   The counterlady came back and we all stood there in line rolling our eyes at each other as she spent the next ten minutes arguing about the broken belt--the Sears folks advocated it was some other defect, not a broken belt. This was after they had already agreed to replace the tire, so the whole conversation was completely pointless and I couldn't help but think she was stalling to make us suffer after she'd already been proved wrong once that day. She was unbearably pushy and the poor lady behind the counter was as patient as she could be. The store manager finally had to be called. He asked what the problem was, heard the bitch's argument, and asked again what the problem was, since they'd already agreed to replace the tire.  She finally left the store and I noted the time they'd told her to come back and get the vehicle, made a mental note not to be around at that time. I shook my head as I got to the counter.   "And you were actually here first," the counterlady said.   Me: "What a  bitch!"  Everyone laughed.

      I have tried everything to get blogger to delete that double post...I even deleted the whole thing, both entries. It still shows up. Maybe it's time I figured out the Dreamweaver html program I have, suck it up, and create my own website. That way I could post photos as well.  I keep dreaming about the new house, about opening a door and finding a whole new room or set of rooms. Last night it was a big, gorgeous bedroom with many windows and a walk-in closet so large someone had pulled a desk in there. The real bedrooms in my real house are rather small, like the kitchen...but I'd rather have small rooms I can paint and floor and, well,  own , than big rooms I've rented. There will be time later on to have a bigger house. And I am only one person and a couple of rowdy cats, this house is more space than I've ever had.  It was a busy week and I'm so sore from physical training, I feel like I aged fifty years in two days. We played basketball--which I hate, by the way, but had to play as vigorously as possible so as not to let down the other two members of my team--and yesterday we had a company formation run that was pure torture. And I suppose there's a first time for everything--I couldn't keep up. However, the company commander (a guy I think is just a  weenie ) took off at the beginning. The first mile was in less than seven minutes. The standard is to be able to run four miles at a nine-minute-mile pace, or four miles in :36. My fastest two-mile time for the Army Physical Fitness Test is right at fifteen minutes, or two 7:30 miles. I cannot maintain a seven-minute-mile pace even for one mile. AND I still finished the four miles in under 36 minutes.   It  pissed me off . I guess this asshole thinks he has something to prove, that a company formation run is an opportunity for him to stroke his ego. I've never fallen out of a formation run in my life. And you know, later in the day I spoke at length with a woman I met who is an FBI agent in Kentucky...this Army ego bullshit will only get worse for me as I get older and my run times start to decline. It's not that I cannot meet the standard--I score the maximum on my PT test every time I take it--but it ruins my whole day to fall out of a run, even though logic tells me there is nothing I can do when some asshole takes off at that pace.  The FBI has roughly the same physical standards the Army has--you must be under a certain body fat percentage and pass a physical fitness test every six months. The big difference (and it is BIG) is that in the FBI, you are expected to maintain your fitness on your own, there isn't this group training crap that I hate so much in the Army. They even allow you time during the work week to work out. In other words, they treat you like an adult by trusting you to take care of your own business. That aspect alone could sell me on switching over.  The very idea of waking up in the morning, getting out of bed, and running from my home, showering there, and getting to work--it's VERY appealing. And military veterans get all kinds of perks and preferences--higher pay, more vacation time, more autonomy in choosing assignments, etc. I've been tossing this idea around for a couple of years now--I have 18 months left on my obligation. I have to drop the paperwork one year out, and it puts a cloud over one's head to do so. Supervisors don't treat you as well, everyone regards you with a certain degree of condescension, they treat you like a bit of a traitor. But you know, I'd emerge from that year even more convinced that I'm doing the right thing.

      There's a stoplight just past Wal-Mart on the way to Sackets Harbor on Route 3 where the four-lane becomes a two-lane about two hundred meters past. It's also just after the left everyone makes to Lowe's. I usually stick to the right-hand lane, the one that ends, because there's usually one in every crowd wanting to make the Lowe's left, and if you get stuck behind them, forget about the next light or two, you're Stuck like Chuck.  Today I spent over $200 at Victoria's Secret (sounds excessive, but they make The Only bra I can wear, period) and on the way back, got caught in the right hand lane at the light. I'd have to merge over. The car to my left was a little Neon, or the Dixie Cup of automobiles. They drive like a sewing machine, I rented one once. Behind the wheel a typical North Country character hunched--morbidly obese, long stringy hair, general look of disgruntlement on her face.  Mind you, I'm not usually one of those jerks who floors it on the green light. I drive a four-door pickup truck, a far cry from a Camaro or some other hey-look-at-me sports car. I'm perfectly content to merge in behind someone else at that light. Today, however, was different.   At the exact nanosecond the light changed, Miss Neon stomped the gas. Her tires squealed a bit.  Oh, hell no,  I thought, and gunned my big V6. I glanced across at her--she actually  leaned forward over the steering wheel,  as if this would be a photofinish, and perhaps her glasses would get her across the wire first.   Fortunately, my big bertha has a fierce third gear, got me safely into the left lane, ahead of Miss Neon...who then slowed to about twenty in a forty-five and made a left into a driveway about three minutes later. ??? I don't get it.  Anthropologists have their work cut out for them. Once, at that same light, some jerk cut me off so sharply I had to hit the brakes HARD. He then slowed to about fifteen where there was no way to pass him, blowing his horn and flipping me off all the while. And I wasn't even the one merging, the light was green, I was just driving along, minding my own business. He had those absurd silver silhouettes of naked, seated women with big hair and bigger boobs affixed to each mudflap, you know the ones. He was one of  those.  I didn't tailgate him, I know for a fact that those stupid Playboy girls go hand-in-hand with a large-caliber rifle in the backseat. Or a readily-brandished lug wrench.  I've learned that in most situations behind the wheel, if you just RELAX, quit viewing every driving transgression against you as a personal snub, be courteous enough to let people get in front of you, etc--you get there in the same amount of time and in a much better mood than if you'd tailgated, swore, showed people your middle finger, and cut them off.  But I still couldn't resist once I saw that lady hunched over the wheel. She had to get left behind, and that's all I've got to say about that.

      I waited until the mid-afternoon to venture to Wal-Mart. Big mistake.  Always go at about 7 am , before the throngs of screaming, scampering toddlers and pushy, toothless women leading surly, scruffy little husbands descend upon the place like the American Army in a sandscaped country. I was a P.O.W. for over an hour.   Mind you, this dynamic, the general populace of the Watertown area missing teeth and looking for all intents and purposes like products of an all-too-shallow gene pool, explains the interiors of those houses I looked at last week. Why did it come as a surprise that bad taste translates rather seamlessly from oversized, hot pink sweatsuit (complete with holes in places that make one wonder exactly how they got there-- delete! delete! Damn, I can't lose the image!! ) at Wally World to brown and orange shag carpet in the home?  Lord, folks, I KNOW you're watching television--surely you noticed the absence of hot pink sweatsuits and brown shag carpet? What, are you watching The Brady Bunch by day and Flashdance all night?  And I have to make the point that I spend more money at the grocery store than I would if I ate out every single meal. Why do I spend over $100 a week on groceries? Because it costs more to eat healthy food. Fresh blueberries cost more than a supersized combo meal. I don't even want to TALK about how many packages of low-calorie raisin English muffins (LORD, they're yummy) I go through in a given week. Not to mention the luscious, 3-point Chocolate Chocolate Chip muffins I have to have you know,  every day . Nuke it  for thirty seconds, it tastes just like a freshly baked brownie. For about two bucks each.  Soft, gooey, fragrant chocolate cakey muffin for 3 little points--hell, I earned 5 points running this morning...again, in the snow, in a punishing wind. Only this time, when I got to my turnaround point out on the shore of Lake Ontario, I had it made--the wind that had made me feel like I was in that Talking Heads video, Road to Nowhere, suddenly felt like a helping hand, like it was all downhill without the knee-crushing impact.  It's okay that I spend a small fortune on foods like out-of-season fruit and things that taste amazing but won't make me fat. Again, commitment. And the alternative is a hot pink sweatsuit and brown shag carpet.

      Update on my dad: he's been moved to a "Psychiatric Care Facility" in a nearby town where we also have family. He's still completely delusional, not to mention a little beaten up after his commando low crawl across the street. I'm told his house is an absolute disaster, the kind of place you walk into and know that there is something dreadfully wrong with the occupant. I worry about how all this will be paid for--I know I cannot contribute much if anything, and my brother is homeless. With any luck, though, Jon will come home to Oxford and move in with Dad, look after him. I hope that arrangement works out--he clearly can't live on his own, and since Jon's homeless and all...living with a raging lunatic beats sleeping in the car.  I just watched  Breakfast at Tiffany's  for the first time in years...20/20 hindsight, I was  appalled  at the Mickey Rooney character. So unapologetically racist! I know, the movie's a classic, it was a different time, and I understand...still, it was almost unbearably annoying. I'm not judging Blake Edwards or Audrey Hepburn or Mickey Rooney--I can be annoyed and sympathic at the same time.  Then I spent about an hour cleaning the house top to bottom, all except this office room, which is a disaster beyond help until I move out. I plan to go through all this crap this week, throw out masses of clothing, paper, etc. Even at my worst, this room is really NOT that bad.  A little cluttered, but you can tell the clutter is recent clutter, not the buildup of one losing touch or the ability to care.

      Last week I read on the area running club's website that there was a 5 Mile Shamrock Run to take place this morning. It was mid-afternoon as I read about it, cozy warm in the home, and it all sounded like a fine idea. I have to get back into middle distance at  some  point, right?  So last night I went to the Brewpub only briefly, and sat there with my little glass of water, went to bed early. I accidentally awoke at 4:00 this morning (it happens from time to time), made coffee and oatmeal, then took a little nap prior to the 10 am start time. I saw that it was 6º outside, but was not discouraged. I layered up, drove downtown, and followed the other runners to the starting line.  It was a pretty sparse crowd--given the increasing rate of snowfall and the bone-chilling wind, it wasn't surprising. I chatted with an old teammate of mine from the Fort Drum Army 10-Miler team. It's amazing to me now that I could run 10 miles only six months ago.  I knew the first mile would be a bit difficult, with the cold and wind and snow. But actually, the first mile passed fairly pleasantly--I hit the mile marker in 9:00, which is pedestrian for me when I'm in better shape, but the way I'm rolling right now, I have to be patient, take what I can get.  Then we took a hard left turn, into the blistering wind, and straight up a steep hill. It would be the first of many. Despite our location in the middle of the formidable Hindu Kush Mountains in Afghanistan, Bagram Air Field is flat as a pancake. Nary a hill to be found.  I comforted myself by thinking that the return trip of the out-and-back course would be all downhill. And the wind would be at our backs. I even felt a burst of energy and motivation just before the turn-around point, surged ahead, and passed one runner after another...I'd set my sights on the next struggling figure, and accelerate until I'd reeled them in. I felt great. For about a half-mile.  Then came the turn-around point, when you get to see just how far back in the pack you are as you face everyone behind you. At first I saw literally no one outside the few I'd passed in my moment of strength. There was a car behind one lady... the trail vehicle?  I wondered. A deflating thought, that I was this close to the trail vehicle, otherwise known as the vulture, the buzzard, waiting to pick off those of us who succumbed to the strong temptation to lie down on the pavement.  Someone hit the toggle switch, on both the wind and hills. So much for a downhill, backwinded cruise home. That stretch where I'd felt strong enough to surge ahead? It was downhill, now a fat uphill that snaked as far as the eye could see. The urge to lie down on the pavement became a compulsion. I began to wonder what the hell I'd been thinking to leave my warm bed--I could be at the Tin Pan eating pancakes with my buddy right then, rather than chugging up a long hill. In the snow. In the wind. What was I  thinking?   I passed the ambulance coming the opposite way, the real trail vehicle. Just in front of it loped an old man, all decked out in ski goggles and bright red tights, just grinning away, happy to be there, even if it was just in front of the vulture. I remembered the half-marathon I ran in Korea, when I was the one just in front of the ambulance--I could hear it patiently breathing behind me, wondered what the guys inside were saying (probably pointing out my big ass, I figured). And right now it was all I could do not to lie down in front of the ambulance,  take me ! But that old guy, he shouted good morning at me as he waddled past.  Then reason kicked in...I know what I was thinking, why I do this shit to myself--I've made a commitment to fitness, one I hedged on while in Afghanistan by not working out as hard or as often as I knew I should.  At least I'm out here gutting it out , I thought,  at least I've still got the drive to do this. At least I'm not walking.    And there were plenty of people behind me--younger, thinner, many of them male. Behind me. I finished in an unimpressive :47 and some change. My lungs feel as though I spent the morning in the gas chamber. My right knee, recently diagnosed with osteoarthritis, crunches and creaks and causes great pain going down the stairs. I'll be sore tomorrow--I haven't run that far since early January. But I'm glad as hell I ran that race instead of stuffing my face with pancakes this morning!  Besides, pancakes don't fit well into the Weight Watchers program, another commitment I've made. Too expensive, points-wise. As The Penguin (John Bingham, another back-of-the-packer who writes for Runner's World) points out:  The miracle is not that I finished, it's that I had the courage to start .  Waddle on, friends.

      I must admit, Dell is doing better than I thought with this damn laptop I bought...they're sending me a whole new one in two days, and I don't even have to pay to ship the busted one back. The real maddening thing about this new one is, the t and y buttons keep sticking, so I have to go back and retype each letter four, five, six times. Drives me insane. Maybe the new one won't lock up and act all stupid.  Dad was admitted to inpatient psychiatric care earlier today--while he sounded confused and a bit out there yesterday, today he's completely incoherent. I called and he went on and on about Peter, Paul, and Mary...yeah, the musicians. ??? The doctor thought it could be precipitated by some mad DT's, but thinks it's much deeper than that. I can say he's always been paranoid to the point of unreasonable for about a year--he threatened to sue the police department after his public drunk arrest, because he was "framed." Nevermind his blood alcohol was four times the legal driving limit. My uncle is the Police Chief, and according to Dad, was carrying out a long-standing personal vendetta.   So this has been brewing for awhile now. How this extended inpatient psychiatric care will be PAID for, I haven't a clue.   I've had enough drama for today. I think I'll go to the Brewpub and have a beer.  One  beer. I'm following the Weight Watchers plan to the letter, and in three days am already down three pounds. Water weight, I know, but I'll take it. At least the numbers are now moving the  other  way. Besides, I'm running in a 5-mile race tomorrow. I must be a glutton for punishment, because it'll be about 18º out there, not exactly ideal.   This morning, however, was lovely--we had a blizzard that dropped about seven inches of snow, and it raged until about noon with 35MPH winds. I awoke at about 6:30 am, just about the time I'd be getting ready to walk outside for PT if I weren't on leave. I opened the windowshade so I could watch the snowstorm from under my flannel sheets and down comforter, let both kitties curl up on the bed, and went back to sleep for about four hours. Delicious.

      My dad has straight lllloooost it.  A bit of background: he's been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. My mother, being a classy lady from a really good Mississippi family, was all that stood between him and total loss of control. She died in the spring of 2002. And the hits, they just keep comin'.  Last summer, he got falling-down drunk on the Square (in Oxford, Mississippi, where everyone knows your business) and was picked up by the cops stumbling around like a frat boy. He's seventy years old. The police report indicated that he'd  pissed himself  and was looking for his car. Good thing he didn't find it, I'm thinking.  There have been any number of minor instances since then. Today I walk in to find an email from my aunt--subject line "Jack," which automatically lets me know he's slipped again.  Here's what happened, from the varying points of view:   HIS PERSPECTIVE: He came home last night and there were eight people in the house. Three were old women and sat on his bed. He began issuing threats, "You've got five minutes to get outta here!" He loaded a pistol and went running around outside the house, fell into a hole, and damn near broke his leg. Then he saw one of the guys out in the woodline and "I fired a round about eight inches over the sumbitch's head, and they all went running around everywhere. So I took a couple more shots and made a break for Ben Massey's house across the road...I had to crawl past some of them, they were standing there when I tried to run past."   ME:  "Did you call the Sheriff?"  HIM:  "They cut the phone lines. I need to talk to Steve about fingerprinting the place...but you know, the weird thing is, they never  said  anything. Not one word."  Do you have the image yet? Old guy running around the woods in Mississippi firing a pistol all over the place, then crawling across the street to the neighbor's? It's a wonder he didn't get shot himself!  EVERYONE ELSE'S PERSPECTIVE: Dad hallucinated wildly and ran across the road to the neighbor's house with a loaded pistol. The neighbor, of course, directly called the Sheriff, who said that when he got there, Dad was hollering at the wall, asking it who it was and why it was in his house. No one knows where the little dog is. He's in the hospital and is still convinced there were "eight weird people in the house."  Here's another odd twist--the Sheriff found no alcohol in the house (believe me,  that's  unusual), didn't smell alcohol on him...again, unusual. Dad told me he hadn't eaten in three days because "his legs haven't been working."   Has he had a small stroke? My uncle, a retired doctor, doubts it's DT's--he says no one would voluntarily dry out like that, to the extend they had the DT's. So he's either: 1) schizophrenic, 2) on drugs, or 3) maybe has Sleep Deprivation Psychosis? What else induces hallucinations so real you load a pistol and fire it off into the woods at silent, house-dwelling strangers?  The maddening thing is, the hospital or doctors cannot tell me anything--he still lists my mom as next of kin, and until it's documented otherwise, they're bound by law to keep the information private. So my uncle, the doctor, is on his way there to "visit," i.e., covertly examine him.  It's a good thing I'm here and not in Afghanistan...I can see the Red Cross message hitting my Commander's desk: "LT B needs to come home now because her dad's chickens hath flown the proverbial coop." And then everyone would look at me crosseyed, wondering when I'd follow suit.

      I think, despite all my anti-viral and firewall protections, I've somehow gotten and spread a virus. I keep getting messages with subject lines like, "Security @ Drugstore.com--You Sent a Message With a Prohibited Attachment." So this thing must've gotten into my history or email addresses (although I don't think I've ever emailed Drugstore.com) and sent itself to all my contacts. I never open attachments unless it's from someone I know. If it reached your computer, I'm terribly sorry--I have the latest and greatest protection, but I suppose nothing's foolproof.  Oscar, my goddamn black cat, somehow is able to sense the exact moment when I drop off to sleep. And yowls in his ugly, warbling voice precisely at that moment, often accompanied by (quite literally) knocking at my bedroom door.  Bastard!  I had to get up rather early by the standards of being on vacation and all, since I have a home inspection this morning...I had to pry my eyelids open. I bet I slept three hours.   Believe me, when I move into the new house, I am locking both of these little shits downstairs. I keep a squirtbottle next to the bed, and will roll over and squirt at him under the crack in the door. But then I'm already awake, and it's always been hell for me to get back to sleep.   I think I'll pick him up and toss him around every time I see him sleeping today. It may not teach him a lesson (I know for a fact he's stupid as hell, else he would not risk his very life waking Mama up), but maybe it'll wear him out enough, he won't have a choice but to sleep all night tonight. The little fucker.  Do you see why I don't have kids?

      I got up this morning, turned on my shiny new laptop, and watched in dismay as it locked right up. That's why I wanted a new one, because the old one was sluggish...and it took over half an hour to get the new one up and running properly this morning. So I boxed it up and it's sitting on my kitchen table, awaiting Dell's piss-poor customer service to give me an "authorization number" so I can send it back and get refunded. Minus a 15% "restocking fee," of course. Complete bullshit. Well, I can eat the $200 or I can keep this boat anchor and eat the $1300. Gotta cut my losses. Mama needs a washer/dryer anyway.  I finally bit the bullet last night and attended my first (in two years) Weight Watchers meeting. I gained enough weight on deployment that my knees are getting beaten up running, and I just feel sluggish with the extra pounds. I don't  look  bad, at least that's what I'm told...but losing a few pounds would be like running around with a medicine ball for months and months, then dropping it. It would feel so much better. The cosmetic benefits are fringe--I just loved the feeling, several years ago, of being much lighter. There were days when running felt so amazing, like I was skimming the ground. I want that back.  Right now I run outside and think, "Damn it, I wonder if people can see my belly jiggling with this jacket on. Shit, my knee hurts. This sucks. I should stop. I can't believe how slow I am. Damn, this sucks." And soon it'll be warm and there'll be no jacket, no hiding the fluff.  I joined Weight Watchers in El Paso several years ago, lost about 20 pounds, then deployed to Colombia and gained most of it back.  Damn it.  My first meeting there, a very large older lady scoffed at me as I sat next to her, "What are  you  doing here? I wish I was your size." But  I  don't wish to be my size. I've been much smaller and felt much better that way.  So Watertown actually has a fairly large chapter. I was the smallest member there, which I admittedly felt a little smug about until these formidable matrons began filing up front to collect awards for the weight they'd lost. One hit her 50 pound mark. Several reached 10% body weight lost. There were a handful of lifers there, folks who had reached their goal weights and maintained them for years. Holy  crap , these ladies are onto something. And they're able to do this with big families to cook for.  I, on the other hand, have no excuse. I cook my own meals, usually just for myself but occasionally for friends who would appreciate something lighter. I can't imagine making a big ole pot of mac and cheese for a child, serving him/her their little portion...then what, put the rest in the fridge?  Right . I'd trough that shit right down until the whole pot was gone and I'd just consumed about a billion calories. I don't do well with certain foods.  So off I go, off IT goes. The timing's perfect--with the big move approaching (damn, still almost six weeks away), I'll be too busy to sit at the trough like a little piggy. And I suspect I'll earn copious Activity Points moving, painting, reflooring, unpacking, cleaning...I may as well shut off the cable until next August.

      Before I was inspired to buy a house, I was inspired to buy a new laptop--mine is maddeningly slow at even the simplest tasks. What can you do, it's two years old, and therefore already far, far down the processing food chain. And I most certainly would not have bought this sumbitch if I'd planned to buy a house when I ordered it a whole week ago. This amount of money could've been a new washer and dryer, dishwasher, AND the pantry. Foolish. And I paid for it outright, no credit card or financing or any other bullshit.  So, you're saying, just return it! The perfectly logical solution.  But I can't. This thing is twenty times faster--the old one would freeze up if all you wanted to do was view another open window. Just infuriating. My one complaint, though, is that this one completely lacks the little keyboard jack.  Are you kidding me??  I had a full-sized, normal keyboard hooked up to the old one, I could type away happily. And this is the one time in my life I've been able to have long fingernails without the threat of their getting ripped off during some Army bullshit.  I guess they make keyboards with USB connections out there somewhere. I'm just surprised by this--why would you omit such a simple connective jack? It does solve the upstairs vs. downstairs conflict raging in my mind for my internet connection--downstairs means tucking it neatly beside the couch when I'm not using it, but it sits in my pleasant den. That means no external keyboard. Upstairs would mean a full desk, the keyboard, etc. I just don't like the look of a desk taking up a corner of the den or dining room.  Problem solved. That's right, one more indication that this house thing was meant to be. I can't even sleep at night, plotting and planning and going over color schemes in my mind...right now I've settled on a gorgeous dark amber for the kitchen (right now it's hunter green with lighter green sponge splotches, the last lady's faux-something treatment). A buttery beige for the den, with the baseboards going from that horrid industrial gray to maybe chocolate brown. The same gorgeous, dusty purple for the bedroom that I have in mine now--I'm still in love with it. The bathroom? I'm not sure yet--it's so small, I'm afraid a strong color would overwhelm it. I'm thinking the same look as the den.  The seller's name is Sherry and she's a cop. Or state trooper, or something. She had a police scanner going ninety-to-nothing in the den and uniforms hanging in the closet. I didn't linger long enough to see what kind. I think it's unusual that the house is going from one single lady to another, both of us uniformed and all. I like that.  Alright, I'm going into the other room to chop off these damn nails...that's just not  worth  it.

      I neglected to address the other homes I looked at yesterday...one was gorgeous but $20,000 higher than the one I went with, and the other three were positively  nasty . We're talking '70's brown shag carpet, bright orange kitchen cabinetry, dingy little cramped rooms, and two reeked of cat piss. It depressed me just to walk into these places. One place had a "half-bath" downstairs that was basically a toilet in a small coat closet. The other just looked utterly neglected throughout the entire interior. And the funny thing is, they both looked fabulous from the outside.  Sounds like some people I've known.

      My bid was accepted last night--I offered the list price with the seller agreeing to pay closing costs and scrape/paint the exterior trim before closing. So in reality, I'm paying about 5G's under the list price.  And last night I dreamed I was moving in and there were all these people around, working on the house or just hanging around, I'm not clear. Every time I walked into the kitchen, it was substantially bigger, much to my growing delight. It's on my brain because it is smaller than I'd like...but you can't get everything you want in my price range, at least not in this wonderful neighborhood. The other glitch in the kitchen: it's carpeted.  Why would anyone carpet the kitchen?    All these flaws, they don't scare me--it just means when I rip out kitchen carpet and pink bathrooms, I'll get to redo them MY way. I'm already thinking laminate/wood floor in the kitchen, and eventually in the den and dining room. This place will look fabulous when I'm done with it.   Those rugs I scored in Afghanistan and Qatar, the framed advertisement posters from the '20's and '30's , the beautifully framed black and white photographs...I buy things when I see them and have faith I'll find a place for them at some point. Self-fulfilling prophecy.   I found an old CD I haven't listened to in years, Lord knows why...it's a Billie Holiday collection, those wonderful songs she did before the heroin took hold. Big band-era. It was given to me by the one frat boy I've ever dealt with, named Stephen. We dated briefly in 1991, having met in a poetry-writing class (imagine that!) taught by a sage named Anne. I still see her when I visit my family.   Stephen, he couldn't write a poem to save his life. I suspect he was there to meet women. I was an English major, did well enough in the class. I still have them, the poems--two of them were published in a Southern journal that year. The great thing about creative tendencies, they stay with you lifelong, you never lose it.  Part of my excitement about the new home is that the basement will accomodate my kiln, and I can start sculpting again. When I joined the Army back in 1998 in order to get rid of my unmanageable student loan debt, I had a studio in New Orleans and had been selling and showing art regularly. I had just signed with one of the more respectable galleries in the Warehouse District and then had to back out--the way my Army contract went down, I had two weeks to ship to Basic Training.  It was the worst two weeks of my life. I felt like a traitor, like I was going to Debtor's Prison, giving up the house and studio I loved, the job I didn't, and even had to give away the cats. It was a barely-subdued panic, thinking perhaps I was making the worst kind of irrevocable mistake.  And here it is, almost six years later, and it was actually the best decision I've ever made. I have a job I love (most days), I make enough money to buy a house, and the sculpture: it's still there. I just have to nudge it back awake.

      It's tough to look at houses and imagine what I can make it look like, because the fact of the matter is  most people have horrible taste.   Saw two houses today--the one close to the park, I'm heavily leaning toward. It needs some work--cosmetic, mostly. But I already plan to rip the entire bathroom out and put all new fixtures, vanity, tub, etc. I shall not sleep until all PINK is out of the house.   PINK. Why would anyone decorate with it? Horrid, silly-looking, little-girl PINK. One of the 3 bedrooms is absolutely glowing from within, goddamn bright pink.   I don't like the carpet, but I can fix that, too. What's going on with the 80's style valences, frilly shit, the Kountry Kitchen look? Folks, it's  gross . Someone out there is thinking, "What's wrong with frilly shit and Kountry Kitchen?  My  kitchen has little duckies and chickens and shiny ruffled taffeta valences, and  I  have taste!"   More power to you. It's just not MY taste.   The big plusses of that Indiana Avenue abode: fabulous front porch. It's a Cape Cod house, very cute. Fabulous deck. Big basement that means I can go get all my sculpture equipment from Dad's house and start cranking again.   The kitchen could be great, even if it's a bit small--needs a new dishwasher and I'd have to build something for a pantry. There is space enough for all this. There's this weird, built-in chest of drawers thing in one hallway and two glass-front bookcases built into the den partition thing--all lovely period touches. It was built in 1910. The average utilities run about half what I pay now.   It's right across the street from Thompson Park in a gorgeous, historic neighborhood. There's a perfect place for a garden. Plenty of closets. An attic. Connections for a washer and dryer in the basement.  I'm looking at four others tomorrow, but I think I'm going for this one. I hope the weather's better by then--it's raining  sideways  out there.

      Gentle readers, yours truly may be about to fulfill a longtime dream--home ownership. I go back tomorrow for my second walkthrough of two likely candidates. It's astonishing what $60,000 will buy in this area--both 3 BDR, all the amenities. One was built in 1840, one in 1910, both beautifully renovated/maintained.   This is the wise move. Fort Drum will expand in the next several years, property will only appreciate. My mortgage would be several hundred dollars per month LESS than my current rent. I qualified for over twice as much mortgage money as I plan to spend, thanks to the lovely VA benefit we soldiers get. And now's the time...my lease is up, and if I wait another year the market will be tight as hell with the base expansion well underway.  Holy crap. I can't believe I can do this--I didn't realize my credit was so good, that it would even be a possibility. Mostly, I didn't know there were great houses out there so cheap! They're both in Watertown, which would mean I'd have to leave my beloved harbor village...but my work commute would also get cut in half. The pros, they far outweigh the cons.  I need house buying advice! Any of you out there who've bought your share of homes, help me out! The one I'm leaning toward lists for $64,000...how much should I offer tomorrow when I go see it again? 60,000? I don't want to get outbid, but I don't want to be a sucker, either! Any sage wisdom about this process would be MUCH appreciated!

      "Reverse SRC" is the painful process all redeploying soldiers must go through...it involves much standing in lines, shots (Anthrax! Ouch!), paperwork...the usual Army drill. We all stood in a particularly long line at the end of it all. At a desk in front of a computer sat a National Guard woman, a Specialist, and it looked from my vantage point at the end/middle/front of this queue that another female soldier kept walking up and bullshitting with her, at which time she'd stop what she was doing and devote her full attention to Soldier B. It was maddening. I joked about it with some Infantry guys around me.  These guys, they were  hilarious . On one piece of the paperwork, it asked for "Specialty," or your military job title. He'd written "Strangulation." He showed it to me.   "Although," he said, "I did kill a guy with an E-Tool." The E-Tool is a tiny little shovel we carry around.   I said, "I make a mean cornbread," pretending to write on my own Specialty line. He laughed.  He was rather attractive, a Captain and not wearing a ring. But silly me, I didn't introduce myself...another missed opportunity.

      I have three days this week to wade through before I sign out on leave. We have a four-day weekend, I'm staying home for the internet guy on Wednesday, and I get promoted on Thursday. I am ashamed to admit, I didn't even finish unpacking last weekend...I worked for several hours at a time, got sick of it, and ended up sinking my fat ass onto the couch to read magazines and watch the Food Network. I love that Esther is so fat--she looks great with the rolls of fat around her neck and works better than a blanket keeping me warm.  I did take the time to purchase and fully assemble both a lingerie cabinet for the bedroom and a baker's rack for the kitchen--both very attractive and inexpensive due to the fact that these muldoons spent about a million bucks figuring out how best to package the 8,000 parts of the furniture, and about five bucks putting the directions together. In both cases, instructions were maddeningly unclear. I ended up ditching them and going by the photo of the finished piece, playing puzzle pieces...easy with the baker's rack, a bit more hit-and-miss with the lingerie cabinet. I was almost finished with it at one point when I realized I had the back/front reversed and had to take it apart and start all over. That electric screwdriver is the best twenty bucks I ever spent. I think I would've smashed the whole thing into a million pieces in a fit of rage had I been turning all those little screws manually. This afternoon, the huge wooden bookcase I needed badly--the cheapies I've been using list badly to one side and will surely collapse and kill a kitty any day now.  That run Friday, the one in 0º? It was pure hell. My lungs were on fire with that cold and I spent the rest of the day wheezing and hacking. They felt  damaged . I'm thinking it may take awhile to reacclimate to this cold...and to think I'd been lulled into thinking the altitude training would take care of me. It went better this morning--it was in the upper twenties, a virtual heat wave, and while I still felt like I was dragging ass, it was managable. I'll get it back in short order, I always do.

      All signs point toward deployment, very soon, and for a very long time. As in, keep your last deployment baggage packed. If it weren't for the fact that my platoon is peopled with highly competent and likable soldiers, I'd be highly upset. I still cannot divulge details because I was told about it in confidence and cannot even tell my soldiers yet. I'll send out a mass email when the information is solid.  Folks, don't send care packages filled with things that will make me fat, PLEASE! Send Prozac. Lots of Prozac, I'll need to share it. And no, I'm not kidding. I'll let everyone know which magazines would make me happy...I was lacking in that department on the last trip.  And please vote Kerry--perhaps he'll appoint folks who can develop a concrete exit strategy from Iraq. There's no way in hell he could damage the Army the way Bush has, or send us to another combat theater before the one(s) that are active get resolved. I'm not aware of any wars that his daddy needs fought for him.   I, for one, will be sure to procure an absentee ballot on my way out the door so I can do my little part to end the current reign of disaster.

      I could be headed out the door again MUCH sooner than I'd anticipated, and for a much longer time. That's all I can say about it. Any and all details are still foggy and will likely change. But I do know that my year of stabilization? The one the Army was "required" to afford me and anyone else who'd deployed? Ha. I don't trust ANY Army policies that could keep us in our own beds for any length of time anymore. They have broken every single promise they ever made us in that regard, and this is no different.  First day on the job: I like the soldiers, I like the leadership, and I hear very good things about the Commander and First Sergeant who will take the company soon. We ran 3 miles as a company this morning, and it was easy enough for me that I jumped out and called cadence. The commander specifically requested me as a Platoon Leader/Executive Officer because there is no female leadership in the company and he thought my maturity and professionalism would serve all the soldiers, but especially the females, well. I am very comfortable in that role. That's the good news.  The bad news: the company spent a year in Iraq, and were among the first in, long before the initial assault. The stories the soldiers told me were unlike anything I've ever heard--the logistics were so bad, they were down to one bottle of water a day in that heat, they deployed with only a rucksack and so couldn't wash or change clothes for  months . My former downstairs neighbor, he left a ground surveillance squad in hostile territory with no way to get back to safety, with darkness falling, enemy insurgents closing in, their position compromised. So the SGT in charge, he pulled over an Iraqi civilian at gunpoint and made the man drive them to camp. What else could you do, sit there and wait for someone to kidnap and/or kill you?  What it all adds up to: the soldiers are highly competent, but they are  beyond  burned out. They just got back from that year in hell last month. And just wait until they get this latest dose of shit on a spoon; we cannot discuss it yet, like I said, I can't go into it. But suffice it to say, when the commander told me, my jaw literally dropped and I was utterly speechless for a few seconds. And not in a good way.  Damn it. I thought I could relax, settle in, BREATHE for awhile. Thanks, George. 'Preciate it, Donald. You'd better give us a HUMONGOUS pay raise, you desk jockey sumbitches.

      I awoke at four a.m., after the quietest night of sleep in recent memory. I can lock the cats downstairs and sleep in silent bliss in that nice, dark room. I am utterly in love with this house and accepting housewarming gifts already...there was a hanging light thing, used but quite nice, on the porch this morning. No note.

      I'm sitting in my new den surrounded by boxes and rubbish, exhausted and sore but very happy that my internet already works. And what a ride these last two days have been.  I retrieved the keys at about 8:30 yesterday morning, drove straight here, and ripped all the carpet out of the den and dining room. I'll get to the upstairs eventually, right now I want the entire downstairs to look stellar. It was pure hell ripping out the carpets--filthy, backbreaking work, and I ignored the sage advice of the Do-It-Yourself Network by leaving it all in one piece rather than ripping it up into nice four-foot pieces. Just seemed like a waste of time to rip it up...that is, until that mammoth chunk of carpet got stuck in the door. I kicked, I pulled, I even slammed my full bodyweight into it. I was sweating profusely and I only had about an hour before I was supposed to go meet my new commander. I don't know what aspect of Providence finally smiled down on me, but it gave and I crashed through the door on top of the whole mess. It's all out on the porch, awaiting the trash hauler to come get it on Tuesday.  The floors...I was hoping for perfection shadowed by the ugly carpeting...and I got something between unsalvagable and perfectly presentable. Once I sand it down and refinish it, it'll look amazing. True to the shortcutting nature of whatever fool last made a weak attempt at restoration, the floor was sanded and finished in a ring around the large area carpet Sally Shittytaste had before Sally Shittiertaste covered it with the grey carpeting.  The next project: address the human filth caked all over the bathroom and kitchen. I sprayed Pinesol in the fridge and let it soften the layer of ancient orange juice on the bottom shelf. The crispers and what shelves could be removed soaked in soapy water on the back porch. I then had to use a putty knife to  scrape  the funk from the rest of the surfaces. Cat hair, people. In the fridge.  And the bathroom made my skin crawl. This was NOT the funk that accumulated in the span of a month or two. This was an absolute  coating , an unspeakable spooge so thick and vile, I completely wore out two scrubby sponges just on the floor. I used an entire spray bottle of mildew remover in the bathtub alone.   Where I come from, we call people who live like that Po' White Trash. No hometrainin'. The next door neighbors even offered to help her clean it, and she flatly stated that she didn't plan to clean at all. Fine, I'll just knock about a hundred bucks off the price of the washer/dryer. We never agreed on a price and she can't take it back now.  So then, I dragged myself back out to Sackets Harbor to sleep, woke up very early, drove into town, and finished pulling staples out of the floor so my help wouldn't tear themselves up. All those people who told me they'd help out? Three showed, even with the keg of beer delivered by the Brewpub. God bless 'em, my three heroes. I don't know what I would've done. We completely filled that massive 26' truck. Unloading is so much more fun, and the Mattress Taco made my whole day.  See, my staircase is not very tall, as in the distance from the stairs to the ceiling at one point...the queen-sized mattress made it through fairly easily. I knew, though, when the guys had to bend it over and smush it through, we could be in trouble with the box spring.  It just flat-out did not fit. We needed about five more inches. I called a local mattress store and asked about buying a split box spring, and the jackass who answered the phone explained in a voice I don't even use with children that they aren't really box springs anymore, you rarely see springs in them, blah blah blah and  who gives a shit , buddy?   Then, he went on to explain that I would have to buy  two  split support mattresses, just one wouldn't be big enough.  Are you kidding me ? Do I  sound  like a complete idiot? No, really, you moron, I thought I'd just buy one tiny little support (not box spring, mind you, very rarely do you actually see springs in them) and just let the rest of the mattress flop over it. Holy SHIT where do they find these people?  So screw that, I just spent a thousand bucks on this mattress set not even one year ago. But I figured, if I'm going to have to trash the original, one-piece BOX SPRING, we might as well try to McGuyver something. We discussed taking a hammer to the part of the ceiling that was in the way. Nah, it wouldn't buy us enough space. By this time, several more people had shown up and the keg had been tapped. We discussed pulling it up the roof and into a window...no windows big enough.  So here's what we did...borrowed a Skil saw, sawed through only two boards, removed the center support bar, and folded that bitch in half like a taco. It actually worked. I took pictures. We were all in hysterics and someone suggested it looked like a cheap horror film, getting swallowed by a mattress taco.  Then the pizza came and the party started. Phil and Dave assembled my new barbeque grill and just for shits and giggles, we put some pizza on it. It was damn good. The patio furniture fits just right, Jon's iron mosquito sculpture guards the whole arrangement. Plans for the house were discussed. It was agreed that the floors wouldn't be a big deal...easy for them to say, they don't have to do it by themselves! Everyone left at around 7 pm, I took a very nice bath in my very clean bathroom, and now I'm sitting here drinking a beer. I'm fixing to go put my linens on and go to sleep.   I am one happy girl.

      I get the keys tomorrow to the new house. I met my new neighbors, and I got lucky once again in that department. Great older couple, been there 25 years. And they have redone their house much the same way I'd do mine if I had the money--knocked out the wall between the kitchen and dining room, gorgeous pine floors, new cabinetry and countertops. I doubt I'll be able to do all that anytime soon.  I've already been swapped from one company to another within my new battalion...I thought I'd be with A Co, who's still deployed, but now it's B Co and they aren't sure what platoon I'll have. They are leaning toward Human Intelligence, which is what I've wanted all along and what I had in A Co. AND, B Co will deploy sooner than A Co. I could find myself right back in Asscrackistan by the end of the year. In which case, I'd have to give away the kitties--I can't put them (or myself, for that matter) through all that again, locking them in the house with little human contact. I do like the company commander I'll work for, though--I'm told he's the type leader who takes his role as supervisor/mentor very seriously, puts much thought, time, and effort into developing junior officers. Sounds like what any LT would want.  I have a 6 mile ruckmarch tomorrow, my last PT with the Engineers. I've superglued extra-large bandaids to my heels, hoping to ward off the usual bloodying these things hand me. Damn it, I'll be all shitty-footed for the move...I'm not kidding, I use superglue on the bandaids in hopes of keeping them on there. Pain in my ass.

      Today was the first real springlike day--63º, gloriously sunny, etc. Now, if we could just get some damn leaves on the trees, maybe some flowers, perhaps it could help get me out of this first-rate funk. It only strikes at night, the funk...certainly a byproduct of all the stress around Dad, the impending move, the job change next week. Let's see...Dad with dementia, first-time homebuying and the move to go with it, taking over a Tactical HUMINT Platoon (spies, they're spies, that's all I know about it) in a new unit where I don't know anyone...stress? What stress?  I think the best therapy will come by way of home improvement projects...I bought six gallons of paint today. I lovely soft amber for the den, a slightly darker of the same in high gloss for the kitchen, a cream color, also high-gloss, for the cabinets, my favorite dusty purple for the bedroom, light sage for the dining room, and an oil-based chocolate brown for the trim in the bathroom that is currently bile pink. The lighter amber will go on the walls. It will be perfectly lovely. Now, if I could just get off my ass and knock out the packing...  Last night the Commanding General returned with all the Battalion Commanders on board...arrival time, midnight. So being that I'm still on the staff, I had to be there. Pried my eyes open at 11:00, back into uniform, drove in cradling a large go-cup of strong coffee. Pull into the parking lot and notice a number of sleepy-looking folks getting back into their cars.   "Hey, soldier, did the flight get delayed?" I asked some youngun walking toward me.  "Uh, yes ma'am, it looks like it'll be 3:30." He has, in the meantime, locked himself at attention.  "Relax, I'm just a lieutenant," I told him. I don't insist on all the bullshit. You can tell if someone respects you or not, regardless of their attention to formalities. I find that putting subordinates at ease this way is an effective way to establish rapport...and rapport with young, lower-enlisted soldiers means they will tell you everything that is going on and you'll have your finger on the pulse of your organization.  So here it was, midnight, and I've got 3 1/2 hours until this damn ceremony even kicks off. It was too cold to sleep in the car. I opted to drive all the way home, 30 minutes each way...the entire time, thinking how wonderful it would be to live so much closer.  I repeated this statement all day long, when I'd gone home early in order to sleep, and the downstairs neighbor's goddamn dog barked all day long. I swear, if I'd had a loaded weapon, I'da shot that sumbitch through the floor. I was wiped out, and plus I HATE other people's noise. I like the downstairs neighbor, but I don't like his music, which is loud enough it makes my drink shake on the table.  Home ownership. It's a quiet neighborhood. The neighbors don't have kids or dogs. If the music is loud, I doubt I'll hear it. Ahhh.

      It has been brought to my attention that some saboteur bitch named herself Miss Kristen and made quite a name for herself and her blog back, oh, five years ago. So now I'm evidently plagerizing.  So help me think of a new title for the blog...the Bath Party? "Do You Think She's Gay Why Else Isn't She Married Yet and What's Up With Wearing Boy Clothes All Day Long Anyway?" Actually, I kind of like that last one. And no, by the way, in case anyone was wondering, I'm not gay. I would've been WAY out of the closet LONG ago if I were.   But I certainly don't have a problem with folks who are--I've even known a growing cast of characters in the Army who are. How do I know?  They tell me , for some reason, and not because they think I might be a Sister, and not because I asked or assumed. They all just TELL me, and usually at the most unexpected times...S told me while we brushed our teeth in Afghanistan. C told me offhand while we shot pool. R told me because he was about to tell the Commander and get out of the Army. The other C had me come into her room in Colombia, showed me pictures of her and her girlfriend, and said, "Um, I'm gay." And these are some of my favorite people in the Army. My usual response? "Oh, okay."  Maybe they just know I'll be okay with it and find it helpful to spill the beans to someone. It cannot be easy, gay in the Army, in this culture where I feel mildly persecuted as a Democrat.

      Someone in Iraq sent me a photo of some soldiers dangling two appallingly large and fierce-looking spiders. One appears to gnaw on a chunklet of the other's ass, latched on securely enough that he's just dangling from him. They look to be Bad. Mamma. Jammas. The debate now intensifies among everyone I forwarded it to, are they truth or fiction, is the photo doctored or not?   We hear all kinds of urban myths about the camel spider from our buddies as they redeploy...I know better than to believe they can run 25 MPH, jump six feet high, suck the blood from an animal four times its size...but you know what? If there's a 10% truth there, that is all I need, jack. We joked about them in the office, about the absurdity of some of the myths. One could chase your Humvee and flip it over with the characteristics assigned to them by the locals in Iraq.  In Korea, I always gauged my reaction to all the enlarged and threatening insects and arthropods by the way the Koreans reacted to them. Once during PT, someone picked up a rock and a H U G E red centipede/millipede I don't care which came boiling out from under it. One basic law of nature--if something that crawls on the ground is bright red, steer clear. It doesn't need to camoflage itself, friends and neighbors, and has survived as a species for these many milennia. And probably not due to its winning personality and sunny disposition. And besides, the Koreans solemnly scattered, directly. I'm sure among Koreans and some of the joes returning from Korea, those centi/millipedes run 40MPH, leap 7 feet into the air and onto your neck, and each little leg contains a poisonous syringe.   Again, a 10% truth is all I need. If it's bigger than my hand in any direction, I want no part of it.

      This morning, six staff officers (myself included) stretched and chatted prior to our run. I mentioned I was having a bugout party next Saturday, with beer and pizza as the incentive for folks helping me move.   "Yeah," Stan said, "The seventeen-year cicada comes out this year. They said it'd be really bad in some places, cicadas everywhere. Cool idea to have a party."  Silence.  What the hell's he talking about??  Reference earlier post from Afghanistan, my conversation with him about the Scooby Doo Mystery Van and Bigfoot up on the Hindu Kush slopes and were rugs invented or discovered? That's Stan. You gotta love 'im.  "Are you thinking of the 17-year locust?" I asked, thinking we'd somehow changed the subject away from my party and would now discuss large, musical insects.  "Same thing, really." Stan changed legs on the thigh stretch, wiped his nose on his sleeve. Suddenly, I got it.  "BUGOUT PARTY...NO, silly! Bugout as in bugging out of my apartment!" I kept recalling this conversation as we ran, giggled all morning.

      Last Wednesday, the officers in the Battalion ran the Black River Trail...5 miles, and I love it. For one thing, it's too narrow to run all together, so it's at your own pace. Secondly, Josee joined us this time, and she's about where I am with running--in need of some work. We struggled to finish in about :50, when I was able to run it in :45 before deploying to the sand box. And thirdly, it's gorgeous, paralleling the river the full length.  Drove to the office and noticed there was a message on my cell phone...these days, any time I see a 662 area code pop up, my first thought is that Dad's done something again. I wasn't mistaken.  He was released from the inpatient psychiatric care necessary after his commando low crawl episode, directly got into his car, went downtown, got drunk, then subsequently picked up for DUI.  The same day . Word on the street is that it took over four miles of being tailed by the squad car in full lights and siren to pull him over. There is speculation that it was intentional, that he wanted to go back to the hospital rather than home alone.   Initially, I was furious. I went to my supervisor to ask if I could take some more leave and get down there, and to my horror, started crying in his office. I am NOT one of those ladies who uses tears as leverage. In my business, bearing is everything and there is nothing worse than losing control. He was, of course, understanding (not to mention uncomfortable), and once I'd showered and ranted to Josee for about twenty minutes, I was fine. I'd even laughed while we were running earlier that I'd do damn near anything to get out of the battalion run on Friday...and I got my wish. I know, not funny, but it made me feel better to laugh about it.  So I loaded up the truck and drove south. It snowed all the way through Pennsylvania and most of Ohio. Then suddenly I rousted out of that autopilot distance-driving trance and noticed that somewhere in Kentucky, I'd crossed the seasonal line into full-blown spring. Wisteria, crepe myrtle, dogwoods, azaleas, all fully decked out. There were even leaves on the trees, even if they were that pale chartreuse of new growth, not the deeper green of full-sized, fleshed-out foliage. I shed my jacket somewhere in central Tennessee.   I also understand that my latent Southern accent reappears with a fierceness when I'm talking to other Southerners, especially if I need them on my side. The nurses at Dad's hospital, the guys who fixed my flat tire (for free, mind you!), old friends...it amused me to hear it from myself. If I'd brought someone I know up here with me, they would've thought I got hit with the Bubba stick at the Mason-Dixon line.   At some point in my late adolescence, I mistakenly judged the Southern accent sounded ignorant, and worked--successfully--at eliminating my own. How stupid. The only people to whom a well-spoken Southerner sounds ignorant, are themselves ignorant and snobbish, and fuck 'em anyway.  Dad is much changed. His speech is slurred, his hair uncombed, and he hadn't shaved...and he has always been a sharp dresser, even around the house. He asked me if I'd made Sergeant yet. "Yes," I told him. "Four years ago." Just the facts, ma'am, I didn't get pissed or sound surprised. We told him we were selling the house, it was his suggestion to sell the car, and we're working a spot for him at the Veteran's Home in Oxford. He was an Active Duty Marine for only eight months...long enough to qualify, evidently.  I visited the Veteran's Home and got the tour from the warm and professional staff nurse. It's a nice enough place, but the vast proponderance of (the first word that came to mind was "inmates") of the patients there were completely incoherent, drooling, babbling...I left the facility in a first-class funk. I kept thinking Dad doesn't belong there, but in reality, he does. The Easter decorations and crafts classroom only made me feel worse, as if I were sentencing him to relive his grade-school years. I don't see where there is another option.  He seemed relieved about the whole thing, as if he'd been overwhelmed by coping alone in that house in the woods. His mail hadn't been opened in months, there were about twenty loads of laundry all over the floor, he hadn't been eating, his finances in a sorry state. The gorgeous antique dining room table and matching sideboard languished in the open carport, where they'd been since early fall, judging by the leaves piled up around the legs and the fine yellow pollen coating it all. The hours I spent in the house were filled with phone calls from sharply demanding creditors, each of whom asking for a copy of my Power of Attorney. Exactly WHO would benefit from my sending it to them? Not Dad, and not me. So go get stuffed, ya'll.  It was  deeply  depressing. It was worse than when I'd gone home for Mom's funeral. The finality of it all was not to be dismissed. It would've been much worse if not for the good fortune of it all happening in Oxford, Mississippi. The thing about small towns is, when the shit hits the fan, everyone galvanizes, there is help everywhere you turn--from the guys who fixed my tire for free, to the honorable lawyer who's been handling all the mess, to the family who took the little dog and has tirelessly handled the daily details, to more old friends I ran into who scooped me up in great, sincere bear hugs. One old friend wants to buy the house. Another has vowed to drive the dilapidated old van up to New York with the rest of the stuff I can't bear to sell--in exchange, he'll get to keep the old van. I don't expect to ever again see the house where my parents lived for twenty years. Or if I do see it, Amos and his wife will be very happy there.  I rented a trailer, gathered up the dining room suite and a few things that had been on top of the mass of junk piled everywhere, loaded it up, and drove it home. I'm back in New York, and my accent's gone again. I miss it a little. And it's winter here, no dogwoods, no azaleas, and I don't think wisteria even survives here. And I can't be angry with him--in a sense, he did bring it on himself by drinking himself damn near to death--the diagnosis is alcohol-induced dementia, which is essentially brain damage, irreversable, and is enough like Alzheimer's that they are more or less interchangable.   But how could I hold onto anger when he is losing everything and will be locked away until he dies? My brother might be able to hold a grudge against even all this, but I can't. And I'm glad I can't.

      Okay, okay, I know I've been curiously absent. I was in Mississippi dealing with my dad's rapidly declining mental state...I'll write a monster post later, or maybe tomorrow morning. I've been driving for almost three days with a trailer behind the truck. More to follow...

      Somehow, I neglected to mention the phone call I got a couple of weeks ago, just after I'd begun to see what a jackass my commander is. It was from the FBI. I filled out an online background form, and the recruiter in Albany called to arrange for me to take the Special Agent's Exam. Which is June 23, at least a week after we leave.  So as soon as we get back, I'll finish that process. She said they'd already done a preliminary background check based on the internet thing, and that my military and intelligence experience make me more or less a shoo-in.  I'm already making plans for dropping my paperwork. It's best to do it from over there, when there will be too many distractions for anyone to take much notice. If I drop the separation paperwork now, it will earn me a great deal of animosity.   But you know, after last week, I don't know that I  care . What are you gonna do to me, stamp my mealcard No Dessert? Send me to Iraq?   Maybe this deployment is exactly what needed to happen, give me the impetus to finally get out and go FBI before it's too late. In fact, if I waited another year, it  would  be too late, they have an age restriction. I often find it irritating to hear chirpy little people say that everything happens for a reason, but perhaps in this case it's true. I'll save enough money to cover whatever move I'd have to make and I know I'll be so burned out, I'll be motivated to stay the course, get to and through the Academy...and after Officer Candidate School, how tough could it be?

      Despite my determination to make myself miserably fat and thereby guaranteeing even more discomfort in the heat of the desert, I've gained a whole half-pound. I'm running at least four miles every day, that could contribute to my failure to pack 'em on.  I'm not really TRYING to get fatter, I'm just eating anything I want--grilled cheeseburgers, homemade ice cream (today I'm making coffee-Kahlua-almond), brownies and cupcakes from scratch, more of that lovely steak. Now I know why that steak tastes so amazing--it's 17 bucks a pound. And I don't care--I bought three more yesterday. And more hamburger meat. Looks like for some reason, I can get away with it.  And it truly does have that pre-execution feel to it. I honestly feel as though I'm about to go spend a year in prison. Actually, if conditions in prison were as I understand we'll face over there, the ACLU wouldn't tolerate it. Desert heat without climate control, no beds, sleep deprivation, infrequent showers, 17-hour workdays, close intimacy with sand fleas and camel spiders? Serial killers aren't subjected to these conditions! If it were a dog in a pen, I'd personally kick the owner's ass!   So, yes, it feels as though I'll go to prison... in rural Mexico .

      I've adopted a pre-execution last meal approach to every bite I put into my mouth... I won't get to eat (Krispy Kremes, homemade vanilla ice cream, insert other impossibly unhealthy, gloriously tasty foods here) for a long time, I'd better enjoy it now.   Consider, gentle readers, the 1 1/2-inch thick filet mignon I bought last weekend and have been too busy to grill up. It was still fresh, so I coated it with a light coat of olive oil and pressed into it a dry rub of every appealling savory seasoning in my cupboard. I heated the grill as blistering as it could get and hit it for a couple of minutes each side, intending to sear it, create a seasoned crust, while preserving a cool, blood-red, tender inside.  Ambrosia of the gods. The fat and olive oil crusted perfectly with the seasonings, the whole thing remained astonishingly tender. Intially, I tucked into it like a starved hostage. But then I cut smaller and smaller bits, slowed down, savored the crisp-tender, almost silky texture of the fine meat, the slight smokiness. I even ate the bits of pure fat, which were the most flavorful of all and retained the finest crusting. Seasoned juice puddled in the plate with each cut. It's too cool to eat outside, but I wouldn't have wanted any distractions for this one. I was happy to be alone, at my antique dining room table, in this sun-filled room, not holding up one end of a conversation. I had full focus on this thing.  I've never had such fine steak--no upscale New Orleans restaurant could rival it. The local brewpub doesn't even come close, and I love their filet mignon.   My favorite side dish when grilling is  cibollitas , or plain old green onions minus the white part, sprayed with Pam, dusted with Kosher salt, grilled just long enough for hints of brownness to show, then liberally drowned in lime juice. When I lived in New Orleans, I would drive all the way across town to have them at a Mexican restaurant we loved. And now I eat them at home several times a week.  At this rate, I won't even fit into my uniform for the initial liftoff...but judging by the 20-40 pound weight loss I've seen out of folks landing there in that impossible heat, I'm not terribly concerned.   And honestly, during these last few days of time off I'll have for the next 365 days, I just don't give one baby rat's ass.

      My commander's considerable brow (that's singular, he only has one) furrowed deeply and he appeared to retain only a thin thread of control. He adopted the tone and mannerisms of one speaking harshly with an exceedingly naughty and stubborn toddler.  "I don't have time to explain the MDMP process to you right now."  Mind you, the MDMP process had nothing to do with my question. I'd just been thrown to the dogs, brought into a mission with which I'd had NO prior knowledge, handed a stack of disorganized and tattered charts, and told I'd brief the Brigade Commander in two hours on an Intelligence Collection Plan that had not yet been created. I asked my commander, whom I'm beginning to view as a REAL buzzkill, for some clarification of what he expected out of the briefing, and got this "you're too stupid for me to deal with" jist in return. Not to mention a rather condescending lecture about Why We Have Named Areas of Interest...a concept I grasped VERY well back in Officer Basic Course. In fact, I grasped it so well they made me the Brigade Intelligence Officer for the exercise.  Folks, I'm not an idiot. And nothing will piss me off faster than being treated as one, especially when the higher-ranking jackass doling out this treatment seems to make a Herculean effort NOT to listen to my side of the exchange.  This conversation ended up lasting an excruciating hour, with me barely controlling MY temper. I felt my face go red. I mentally scrounged for a way to gracefully end this painful conversation, maintain my bearing enough to keep me out of trouble. People I know kept walking by and shooting me sympathetic glances. One tried to rescue me, only to be told to  keep walking .   Can I do this for a full year? Control my temper with this monumental jackass?  Knowing that when we get there, it will be over 120F, we'll be sleep-deprived, thousands of miles from home, filthy, and sick of each other?   I found myself with a gut-wrenching, physical reaction every time he entered the operations tent. He loudly expresses disbelief at how badly things are going (when everything's fine) well within earshot of all the soldiers, he vocalizes his distrust of the NCO's, he considers himself such a genius that nothing anyone else could say that could equal HIS way of doing business. In short, he's an asshole, and crushes the morale of everyone in the blast radius.  And I'm about to go to war with this shitbird. He's my rater (which I care about less and less), he already pushed me over the abyss by placing me inside the Operations tent as a Watch Officer (basically, that bored officer you see sitting in the corner, checking her Watch and wishing she'd never become an Officer), which pulls me away from my fantastic platoon.   If I'm already developing a visceral hatred for this man, what lies ahead? Will I find myself with a court martial for disrespect after I snap and tell him what a jackass he is?   Lord help me. I'm fixing to spend a year biting my tongue and trying to gracefully end one-way conversations. The good news is, I took that stack of bullshit and ran with it, produced a coherent collection plan, coolly briefed it to the Brigade Commander, and learned just how loyal my soldiers are to me. I must be doing something right.

      It's 1:00 am on a Sunday morning, and I've been here since 7 am. On Saturday. We awaited the arrival of the sixteen Guard and Reserve soldiers who will deploy with my platoon. The weather's been dreadful. Flights were delayed, cancelled, baggage was misplaced, it's been storming all day and last night, too. The latest storm to roll through rages outside now, and the last vanful of arrivals now unpack their excessive baggage and repacking it according to the Brigade's packing list. We're all ass-whupped exhausted, hungry, wet, irritable.  So we're rebuilding this team from the ground up. These soldiers just finished training, they have no operational experience at all, and the soldiers we expected to take get to stay here and get a bit of stabilization time. Some of the new ones are Guard, some Reserves, from all four corners of the United States, and very cognizant of the Active Component's perception of Guard and Reserves. They all plan to sew on our Division's patch right away. Many are cops in real life, and most speak at least one other language. They're all friendly and seem eager to integrate.   My first impression of the females, however, is that they could get ahold of some attitude down the line--they showed up here in tight-fitting, low-cut outfits wearing a great deal of makeup. There are three, and this is true of them all. Two visibly sidelined themselves as bags were being uploaded, and two are noticibly overweight.  More to follow, I'm sure...

      Some military jargon:  lickey chewey:  n . A treat or snack, usually sent to soldiers where none are available.  Make sure the Chinook hovers over the firebase long enough to kick out that bag of lickey chewies to Sergeant R's squad.   soup sandwich:  n. or adj . Evidence of incompetence or laziness.  LT S's convoy ended up in a minefield because he can't read a map--man, that's soup sandwich.   shit the bed/went tits up:  v . Ceased to function. We got four miles outside the gate when the humvee shit the bed. It went tits up outside Kabul.  cut the sling load:  v . To dispose of people who are weight without benefit, as if from a load-bearing Chinook helicopter.  Sergeant F is too lazy to take with us, we need to cut the sling load and leave him here.   take a knee, drink water:  v . Action taken in order to recover from some arduous event.  Sergeant R stepped on a landmine while we were on patrol, so I told him to take a knee, drink water, and drive on.

      "LT, SSG R, come on into the classroom."  This from the C.O. (Commander), as soon as we walked in the door this morning. My heart sank. I even joked, "He's fixin to tell us something we don't want to hear."  Sure enough. We got sucked into the deployment. We leave in three weeks. AND we're now a permanent part of D Co, which is unfortunate. Unfortunate because I really liked B Co's command structure, the soldiers, all of it. I've heard nothing but horror stories about D Co's commander. And the jury's still out on Shayla, the Executive Officer--while I'm glad there's another female officer going, I get a competitive vibe from her.   It should be said, I NEVER trust women who don't like other women. They seem to be missing the "cool" gene. But I had a long conversation with Shayla, I think she's generally okay. One thing is certain: by the end of this year living and working together in close quarters, I will either really love her or really hate her. Here's to hoping it's the former.  Anyone out there who could foster a couple of adorable, well-behaved, sweet cats, email me at kristenb1970@hotmail.com. They are my biggest concern right now. Get them taken care of, I can handle everything else.

      I just went to lunch with Vic, the other Lieutenant in the company (he's the Executive Officer and he's great) and my Platoon Sergeant, Staff Sergeant R. SSG R is a calm, humorous, competent professional. I already trust them both completely.  We went to a new Mexican restaurant off post called Antojito's. The only other Mexican restaurant in the entire area is out in Sackets, and it's not very good. Antojito's features tamales that are enough like the ones I loved in El Paso that I can only conclude that there is a genuine Mexican back there. Tamales tend to be made by women, and I used to buy them by the dozen from a convenience store...I'd walk in, ask for a dozen chicken-green chile tamales, and she'd stop working on her stack of the same to plop them into the steamer.   They were amazing. One of the only things I liked about El Paso was the food. But even that didn't compensate for that oppressively barren landscape.  So, today there were tamales...and damn good ones! And for dessert, cheesecake wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried, with an apricot/honey sauce on top.   Immediately afterward, all three of us had a briefing from Range Control--in order to run a range (where we shoot our rifles and qualify on them), you have to have this class. It's about an hour long, in a dark, cool room with comfy chairs that recline just enough...  We were  knocked the hell out . All three of us. I'd look over at SSG R (who's a muscular, bald, black man) just as his head would tip and wake him abruptly. Then I'd struggle. Vic was just flat-out asleep at one point. It was torture and I don't think I retained any information at all, except that if you leave food in your vehicle at the range, the bears might break your window and trash your car. I felt sorry for the briefer but I could not force myself to stay awake. I looked around the room and  everyone  struggled with it. Heads tipped, mouths dropped open, eyelids fluttered. That guy could've told us the Seven Horses of the Apocalypse had just pulled up outside, there'd be no reaction.  Note to self: never schedule briefings, as the giver or the taker, just after lunch. And avoid tamales and fried cheesecake if the timing can't be helped.

      It may have been. A false alarm, that is. We're now told that another company will drive that train, but here's my concern: the soldiers in my platoon are interrogaters...yes, the folks those butthole MP's declare told them to "prep" the prisoners...and it's a tiny, understrength MOS. Which means that while my  company  isn't going, my  platoon  very well could. Which is much worse than if the whole company had gone--I really like my Executive Officer and Company Commander, and I cannot say the same about the other company. Humorless, condescending, sour lot. I'd be much more upset about the prospect of a year away at this point, after getting my hopes up for staying at least until winter, and disliking the other officers involved to boot.   I don't THINK it'll happen. But then, I didn't think we'd get tagged in the first place. I cannot breathe easily until the deploying elements have actually lifted off into the clouds, and even then I could get snatched up.  You know, I love the Army when we're not deployed. I know that deploying is, technically, why we joined...but no one can maintain that kind of operartional tempo, only spending a couple of months at a time in the States. But garrison life, it's pretty great. For instance, tonight we have to report at 2 am in order to welcome home our sister company. Once that's over with, we're dismissed for the day. How lovely...my plan is to grocery shop and hit the Home Depot in the morning, beat the crowd. Then I've got all weekend for house stuff.  The kitchen is coming together nicely. That carpet was truly disgusting...I felt my stomach turn several times during the rip-out process. The floor underneath was coated with years of built-up nastiness, an unspeakable bilge of dirt and various dried liquids. It took sandpaper to get rid of it. I'm not quite finished...by Saturday night, my back and thighs were so seized up from all the crouching, I decided to just finish what was necessary to build the dish shelving and baker's rack, to hell with the rest. I'll start on the remainder tomorrow...kitchens are tough to paint. There are all sorts of spaces that are difficult to reach--between the cabinets and the ceiling, over the fridge, etc.   And I've let it all get a bit messy. That's my project tonight, clean it up before going any further. Unfinishedness is no excuse to let dirty dishes pile in the sink and clutter all over the countertops.

      I spent over an hour typing up a post about my impending departure, my first major home improvement project, and how badly those goddamn "soldiers" in Iraq who took those pictures (you know the ones) have damaged us. And this damn computer loses connectivity for no evident reason (DO NOT BUY DELL). So allow me to take on each topic again.   First, I'm attempting to create my own website, so I can post photos. And as I struggle with getting Frontpage to publish to my newly-purchased site (www.gi-jive-turkey.org), I marvel that so many jackasses manage to create websites every day. Judging by much of the content out there, these folks are a far cry from brain surgeons. Seems like I should be able to figure it out.  My reasons for outrage concerning those photos, besides the glaringly obvious moral bankruptcy of it all:  1)  Arab anger=attacks on Americans. Rocket science? I think not. 2)  Iraqis will not take kindly to apprehension, will die fighting to avoid it.  Chemlite up my ass? I'll pass.   3)  What are the chances American prisoners will now be treated humanely? Slim to none, and Slim just left.  But I didn't have any training! I asked for guidance! Military Intelligence told me to!  Horseshit, people! Does anybody really need to be  told  not to torture prisoners? Haven't we all been trained on the tenets of the Geneva Convensions? (The answer is yes, by the way, it's part of the absolute basic soldiering skills, I don't buy they'd never heard of it.) Are you THAT stupid? How many times have we been told to disobey illegal orders? And oh, by the way, my platoon of interrogaters all tell me that's bullshit, that it's SOP to direct the MP's to "prep" them. Doesn't happen.   And then to take pictures, for chrissake.   It WILL cost American lives. The damage IS permanent. I keep thinking that at some point, I'll stop being surprised by stupidity, but it hasn't happened yet. I'm freshly astonished regularly at what imbeciles lurk among us.  It's 5:15 am, and I've been up since about 3:30. I'm not sleeping well since learning I'm most likely headed to Iraq for a full year, leaving in under a month. Yes, I'm pissed off. I know dozens of officers who have never deployed, and here I get two in one year.   A full year deployed is utterly incomprehensible to me--that's a Korea tour. I just bought this house and it looks like I won't get to enjoy it, or even get all the way unpacked. I'll have to either find a surrogate home for the kitties (how likely is that?), or a new home altogether, which hurts my heart to no end. I'm terribly attached to my little guys, my perfectly-proportioned, fluffy grey Esther and the sleek, handsome little black panther, Oscar. Ouch. There is still a slight chance we won't go, but if I've learned anything about the Army, it's that the news is never good.  It was on the news last night, and annoyed the crap out of me. Our local TV station cannot seem to EVER get unit names correct...they called us 1-10th MI, when we're 110th MI. Seems like a small thing, but it's not...that dash would make us part of a regiment, which we aren't. We're direct support to the Division and the Infantry Brigades.   Then, in the true tradition of Army Public Affairs misinformation, it was stated that NO SOLDIERS WHO HAVE RECENTLY RETURNED ARE INCLUDED IN THIS DEPLOYMENT, when my entire company just got back from a year in Iraq only two months ago. Then the chirpy little anchorwoman said, "Some of these soldiers have been back less than a year!" I had to laugh. Try three months, you Whore of Babylon. It's not her fault, she's only repeating the misinformation handed her by those pogues at Public Affairs.  It will be a daily test of my character; it's in times of chaos that calmness counts the most. I have to think of how my behavior will effect my soldiers, keep that in the front of my mind at all times. Whether or not I agree with the mission or the timing is irrelevant--if my platoon goes, I go, simple as that. I should count my blessings that I have such great soldiers, especially the Warrant Officer who so clearly has my back. I'm lobbying against sending the Sergeant First Class about whom I've only heard the worst possible gossip...he's lazy as hell, he's a liability, etc. The Staff Sergeant who is currently my Platoon Sergeant is so overtly outstanding, to replace him with this bag-o-donuts would really chap my ass.  I think the weblog will be a base of sanity. I'm liable to get really, really bluesy if this thing kicks off like we think it will.

      It happened in Korea. Then it happened in Colombia. Then in Afghanistan. Now it's happening here in the Sandbox.   The case of the Exploding Ass.   I wash my hands religiously. I use gallons of hand sanitizer. I only drink bottled water. To no avail. I still spend all my free time hunched over in the portajohn...which, by the way, is essentially an oven in the midday heat. When I'm briefing the Colonel, I'm praying all the while, not here, not now.  Here's a way you can approximate how we live here, exploding ass excepted: bundle up in long sleeves, pants, etc. Then add the thickest down vest you can find (that's the body armor). Weigh yourself down with a bunch of gear, put a motorcycle helmet on your head. Now hop into your car in the middle of the day after it's been out in the direct sun. Go ahead and leave the door open, I'll allow that. Crank it up, turn the heat on high, and sit there with that blast in your face for a few hours.  But you know, for some reason I'm not miserable. Actually, I felt okay all day. I'm either acclimating or just accepting it all. Okay, so it's hot. Yep, there's blowing sand. Roger, we live in the ghetto. And yeah, I'm not crazy about the job I've been given. But at some point I think I must've mentally rolled up my sleeves and decided to quit fighting it all, just roll with it. I feel better when I force myself to be cheerful--mood follows actions.  I'll somehow make it through this thing. I wish I could be more descriptive, but Operational Security dictates discretion.

      We're in Kuwait for the next three weeks. And you know, if I lived in a place like this, I might be pissed off at the world, too. It is an absolute shithole.  The winds vary from Moderately Annoying Sandstorm to No Visibility Sandstorm, depending on the time of day and how many degrees over 100 it happens to reach. The hotter it gets, the higher the winds.  I'm told we'll live well once we get to our permanent area. I'll believe it when I see it. Right now we're crammed into a damaged tent--I wake up several times a night to a sandblast to the face, which I suppose could have theraputic exfoliating qualities...but  not when I'm trying to sleep , damn it!  And I'm trying to keep my chin up professionally--That Jackass gave me a job I am absolutely NOT interested in doing, and will not listen to the four other officers telling him that I should work with my platoon on Human Intelligence Analysis. I'm to the point where the very sight of this man makes me want to shriek. And it hasn't even been a week.  My job right now is as Collection Manager, which means I marry up intel requirements to assets. Booooo---rrrrinng! I'm trying to understand how the HUMINT Platoon Leader gets sucked into this shit. Basically, I'm a staff officer, which is exactly what I didn't want. This is, in my estimation, absolute worst case scenario for how I'll spend this godforsaken year.  But I did tell everyone who needs to know up my chain that I intend to leave the Army, got the paperwork started. One officer tried to talk me back into staying in the Army, but I stopped him in his tracks.  Buddy, you don't get it, I am DONE with this crap.    It can only get better. Right?

      The first of the technicolor, Mefloquine-tainted, virtual-reality dreams came upon me last night. Reference earlier post from Afghanistan about the psychological side-effects of Mefloquine. Shit makes me crazy. The dreams are the best part of it. The paranoia, irritability, and the way it turns your entire digestive tract inside-out...I could do without those little perks.  So at any rate, in this dream, I had returned from Iraq, left the Army, taken a job in some swank office building that also contained my apartment. And what an apartment it was--huge, with plush bathrooms for each oversized bedroom, windows everywhere. I walked around deciding which room I would call my bedroom...except that the place was  trashed.   The previous occupants were ditzy coeds. Dirty laundry, old garbage, long-spoiled food languished everywhere you stepped. I had just decided to call the landlady and raise holy hell when I came across the head of a cat on the kitchen floor. As I stood horrified, it began wiggling around, making noise. And the whole garbage can was full of rotting kitty corpses, all moving around and making a fuss.  See what I mean, psychological side effects? I dream about houses all the time, and it's almost always a case of their being large and beautiful and full of doors that open to entire wings of rooms I hadn't known about previously. And almost always in a state of disrepair, in need of an owner who would make it into something. And these dreams started a decade ago, long before I owned a house.  But dead kitty heads running around on the floor?!? Good lord!   I must admit, though, it is HIGH entertainment.

      Yesterday, I took a 5-mile run on a trail I love that parallels the Black River the whole way. I mostly gazed out at the river, not my feet, and hence came very,  very  close to one rather large, well-fed porcupine.  It stood up on its hind legs on the side of the trail, some sort of vine in its hand which it slowly ate. I braked just in time. I didn't want to jump over it, 'cause can't they, like,  shoot  quills at you?  Then I just bent down and watched it. "Hey, uh, I tell you what, you go your way and I'll just go mine, deal?" It reacted like a pampered patron at the Four Seasons seated at the table next to Anna Nicole Smith's entourage...shot me an annoyed glance over its shoulder, kept eating leisurely.  How uncouth, how untoward. Can you NOT see I'm trying to enjoy my luncheon here?   I grinned and crept past, still envisioning quills! shooting! into! my! leg! He was gone by the time I'd finished the trail and came back his direction.  Then this morning, I heard the distressed squawking of a bird growing steadily louder and closer. And Esther crashed into the dining room through the slightly-open deck door with a grey dove in her mouth, which she released into the kitchen as all hell broke loose.   It flew into the window, POW! Then into the wall, BANG! I thought the next impact would surely crush its light little skull. It hit the floor as I pushed the cat out of the way, then darted into a space I didn't even know existed...under the cabinet, there is a hole in the baseboard that leads into a small, awkward spot under the counter, where the drawers don't reach.   Shit! How the hell to get it out of there? I could hear it flapping a squawking. I tried a broom...hell no. I tried to pry up the countertop...it became clear right away that I'd have to remove the entire sink for that one to work. Finally, I just stood there and waited.  It didn't take long for it to head for the light and burst from the little hole it had squeezed through. I caught it and held it in my hands, all trembly bird energy. It didn't seem hurt and flew for the stately maple tree in my yard when I released it.  I've been a terrible procrastinator. I must go pack for this goddamn deployment. I'm putting together a series of care packages for myself, all the crap I can't fit in that giant rucksack...my fancy-schmancy Camelbak, eight books (Tom Robbins, mostly, and some Flannery O'Connor), extra superpowered sunscreen, girly shit like haircolor because I've gone so grey and I just don't need to see it.  But right now, I'm not quite done with this month's Runner's World and it's a beautiful, warm day. The front porch beckons.

      Awoke earlier than I'd intended due to the bright sunlight streaming into my room. I adore this house--any time of the day, there's sunlight everywhere. This particular morning, though, it's thirty-nine degrees. In June. I'm running the  heat , for chrissakes.  God I'm going to miss my life here. We leave Wednesday. I can't help having a bad attitude about it, because I  don't want to go . Period. I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way, but I was somewhat excited before we went to Afghanistan, it was this big adventure. But now I know the truth about deploying--it sucks. It's boring, it's acutely uncomfortable, and I was only in Afghanistan for five months. This one is for a year.   I can't even conceive of it--that's a Korea tour. And THAT felt like a decade, the year I spent in Korea--where I had a room, a bed, a shower, hot food, all the books I wanted, subway trips to Seoul. There will be none of that in Iraq.   I'm struggling to wrap my head around this thing, because this time I'm the one in charge. Right now I need to pull an Oscar-winning performance out of my ass, smile like an idiot, and GET EXCITED!  Isn't this fun, ya'll??   I think I found the absolute perfect Brownie recipe. I should've known it would be the best one, it came from Good Eats, on the Food Network.  Good Eats is hosted by this character named Alton Brown. I love this guy. He's like a Mr. Science for food. He'll demonstrate why your souffle' falls by blowing up twenty white balloons and going into the Molecular Structure of Egg Whites. But these brownies, they have four eggs and two sticks of butter--just pure fat and sugar, like a brownie should be. I just heated some up and topped it with some vanilla ice cream for breakfast.   That's what I'm talkin about!!

      "I got a call from the CG about you today."  CG=Commanding General, as in the two-star guy...and this one, he stands about six-eleven and sounds like the Voice of God from high in the stratosphere. Needless to say,  I got a call from the CG about you  is NOT a statement I'm looking to hear from the mouth of my commander, jackass or not.  "Yep, he says you're non-deployable. Do you know what that's about?"  For one moment, my heart soared. But then reason took hold...I knew it would be some mundane technicality, one that would quickly get resolved.   I was, of course, absolutely spot-on.  "Um, it must be because I just got back from Afghanistan."  "Oh, so you'll need to sign this form..." He (with much mustered nonchalance) pushed a counseling form across the desk to me, already filled out, with the title DECLINATION OF STABILIZATION PERIOD/VOLUNTARY DEPLOYMENT. Then I got it.  He (my commander) waited this long to present me with the fact that I could, in fact, decline this deployment. I felt a little sick to my stomach as I read the form... I understand that this deployment is for the period of one year or until mission completion...my participation is entirely voluntary...   See, the commander knew that if they'd presented me with this document a month ago, I may very well have refused to sign. I still could. It was never pitched to me as something I could  opt out of --instead, I got the speech that went something like this:  the Army never guaranteed any standard length of time between deployments, this is what you signed on for whether you knew it or not, we're counting on you to be the kind of leader who will stand strong for this mission ...  In other words, vastly different from what's actually going down on paper. On paper, I fully stepped forward and said, Ooo! Ooo! I WANNA GO!!  So did I sign? I hesitated, while certain thoughts went through my mind:  what do you care, you're fixing to leave the Army and join the FBI, you could stay and work on the house...   But of course I signed, and here's why: I'm a leader of soldiers, I'm in charge of forty-two  people , we're in this together. And who would suffer if I acted like a little bitch and backed out one week before we leave? Not my commander, not the CG...these soldiers and my fellow lieutenants, that's who.   See, I have to be able to look myself in the eye as I'm brushing my teeth in the morning. And the six years I've already served would be forever tainted by this one cowardly act, refusing to go to combat with my troops. And the thing is? The commander KNEW that. That's why he waited until the CG called, until my not having signed that form became  an issue  with The Boss.  But here's what I also know: I'd still get deployed in September or January, at least this way I'm getting it over with. Also, I know I was hand-selected for this position, and it's a testament to the Battalion Commander's confidence in my abilities to lead this platoon. AND, the other lieutenants in the Battalion, the ones who could/would potentially replace me...well, this platoon needs someone who's willing to be A Total Bitch (i.e, ME) and stick up for them with this commander. I don't trust them to anyone else. You know, when you want something done right, you do it yourself? Yep, that's exactly the case here.  I'm not a Patton. I'm not a Bradley, not a McArthur. But neither am I a chickenshit, and the thing is, I DO care (very much, actually) about what happens to these folks.  So this job, I'll do it myself. I couldn't stand it if one of these soldiers approached me on returning and reported how fucked up things were and that their Platoon Leader wouldn't stick up for them.  So what I need to do now is quit thinking about how I could've said no. I need to quit being pissed off about getting sent right back out the door, get my head in the game, and just move out, do what needs to be done.  OK, got it. Saluting smartly and moving out.

      No, I did not speak with The Boss about The Jackass. I've concluded that it's all around, a bad idea. I think the better course of action is to galvanize the other lieutenants--if we present a united front, he'll HAVE to see a pattern.   TK, he won't have any problem at all standing up to him. He's a big guy, confident and competent, and I think he'll jump right on board.   Shayla, on the other hand, seems much more timid...but I don't know how much is timidity and how much is pure generosity. She feels compelled to take abuse in order to deflect it from others, and I can't fault her for that. But at what point does Generosity end and Doormat begin? I don't think she's quite to the doormat extreme, but she could get there.  She is, by the way, enormously generous of spirit. I can be a perfectly stubborn, selfish bitch when provoked, but her generosity seems limitless. She and I should, perhaps, allow ourselves to be influenced by the other. Because we are, in almost every conceivable way, polar opposites. But not in a manner that causes conflict--we're both fairly easygoing overall. We get along great--I don't find her quiet acceptance of All Things Jackass particularly annoying. I'm just much more judgemental, easily provoked by people I Just Don't Like. I have a strong sense of What's Fair, and I get pissed when I feel someone isn't shouldering their slice of any burden, not doing their job to standard and expecting me, my platoon, or the fellow LT's to pick up their slack.  I like that she stays so positive, no matter what. I could learn from that.  But the big difference between myself and Shayla, she can stay calm and swallow it when he treats her like shit. Me, I feel my face turn red, I fight tears of rage, I have to go lock myself in a portajohn or other guaranteed cover/concealment, then I come back purely pissed and want to take his head off. And I can't keep my frustration hidden from the other soldiers...she can.   So I'LL be the one with the Court Martial, and SHE'LL be the one with the stomach ulcer. But I do wish she'd be a bit more assertive--he has no idea how badly he treats her. She gets it much worse than either TK or I get it, because she doesn't react. Me and TK, we're the first to holler, THAT'S SOME BUUUULLLSHIT!

      I've decided to be a grown-up about dropping separation paperwork--tomorrow I'll submit it to the Personnel Officer, ask him to make me an appointment with the Battalion Commander, and be completely honest with him: that I was already on the fence about the Army after Afghanistan, that I have a bad feeling about this deployment, that I'm not at all interested in the jobs ahead of me in the Army. Let him chew me out (which he will), give me the standard speech about how My Country needs me, I'm turning my back on My Country...none of it will change my mind.   But it does give me a perfect opportunity to tell him how fucked up things are around this deployment...how the 2-shop didn't produce the bare essential products for intelligence collection, how the lieutenants will be the ones to bear the brunt of the bad leadership, that I predict that when the dust settles, few (if any) of the soldiers in this miserable company will stay in. That's what piss-poor leadership does, embitters everyone in the blast radius, makes us all hate the leadership.  There's already talk that The Jackass could get fired over there. Yes, it happens in the Army--as a company commander, it's a career killer. But this shitbird NEEDS his career killed, he needs to NOT be in charge of soldiers, before he gets someone killed.  So I probably won't go into details with the Colonel about just how fucked up it is, since that will create even more animosity between me and That Jackass. I'll tell him enough that he gets the picture, finesse it to where he draws his own conclusions.

      The last few days have been as tumultuous as always--I was given yet a-Nother job as the S2X, which would put me in charge of all the Human Intelligence operations. Then yesterday The Jackass opined that the job would be more suitable for an Infantry Captain. ?!? Did I miss a meeting somewhere? How would an Infantry Captain be better at an Intel job than I would? OK, put me in charge of a rifle platoon, let's see how  that  goes.  On the bright side, I am working with the most charming man--warm, funny, easy on the eyes. And here I sit in men's clothing, no makeup, showers only occasionally, my hair plastered to my head with sweat.  Mmmm, yummy . I tell you, if I somehow manage to attract this man in the state I'm in, it's purely a testament to his sweet nature. Because I look like holy hell.   Makes the days a little bit brighter, though, having him around. He's with us for six&nbsp; months as a contractor. So I have one little thing to look forward to in the mornings, a little something to get me out of bed. I'll take what I can get.

      Jackass has been so unnaturally nice these last few days, I'm waiting for the catch, the proverbial Other Shoe. He said I looked tired last night and sent me home.  Huh???   I slept soundly until about ten pm local time when  BOOM!!!  Huge explosion.  BOOOM!  Even bigger one five minutes later. A bunch of us gathered outside after turning off our porch lights so the sumbitches wouldn't have anything to aim at. We could see blue flashes of light from both the east and west, the ground shook. There's no bunker, so we stood there laughing nervously.   "Was that one closer? Are they bracketing?"  someone asked. Bracketing is what folks do with artillery, use a spotter and tell the dude firing the tube to crank it left or right so they can hit the target.  So we all felt pretty sheepish this morning when we read that only the first explosion was an incoming mortar...the other ten?  Us firing back , hallalujah.  Just now all the field grade officers in the Brigade Headquarters freaked out, walked from office to office shouting and swearing and threatening to fire folks. A fist fight almost broke out between two majors.   When will these infantry types learn that it's in times of chaos that calm counts the most? And that jackassery has a way of trickling down if you don't have a strong enough leader in the&nbsp;middle&nbsp;as a stopper? They all reminded me of little barking chihuahuas, walking&nbsp;around spreading vitriol without task or purpose&nbsp;or direction.  So I escaped. It's air conditioned in here. I snuck out with&nbsp;our Warrant Officer and Shayla, the other female lieutenant. They won't miss us in the chaos.&nbsp;

      I thought I'd lose an assload of weight here...and I have lost a bit, although I don't have a scale to gauge off. But today for lunch I had Bananas Foster with vanilla ice cream. So much for "Iraqi Fat Camp." Yes, it's hot as hell and (mostly) ugly to look at around here, but  damn  the food is good. And I bet I walk eight + miles a day. &nbsp; I ran this morning for the first time since early June--felt slow but I was so glad to get back into the groove, I didn't care. Additionally, I can only do twenty push-ups pre-muscle fatigue right now, down from the 60&nbsp;I cranked out on the last PT test. Horrible. I'll get it back, the FBI Academy beckons. &nbsp; My commander roped me into running around with him all morning to make sure our equipment made it from the road to our area. It was miserable. He drove like a maniac (even my little boobs were sore with all the bumping around), and said the most appalling things I have ever heard anyone say with any seriousness.  &nbsp; He was upset with me because I took the time to eat breakfast yesterday morning. I'm not kidding. Then he expressed, "I don't understand this preoccupation with  chow . I don't live my life from one meal to the next. We have a  mission  here. I need to have the First Sergeant conduct a come-to-Jesus with all the NCO's, and I'm gonna talk to the Lieutenants...I mean, the reason nothing's getting done around here is because you all keep releasing soldiers for stupid shit like  chow .&nbsp;I can't understand this peacetime mentality..." On and on  ad infinitum . &nbsp; Do I misunderstand, or does he intend to deny soldiers food every time some little thing pops up? Mind you, we were NOT in the middle of some critical task. We were downloading equipment and setting up a tent. &nbsp; I knew better than to ask if  I  could go to  chow . I missed two meals yesterday this way. So today I took off before he could lasso me into his web of bitterness. &nbsp; And so had the most lovely Bananas Foster for  chow.

      No shit, there I was, moving north from Kuwait to Baghdad on a three-day hell convoy. I had a PFC driving, the ambient temperature with the asphalt and whatnot was about 130º, we wore full body armor, and the first thing we saw outside the gate was a dead camel stretched halfway across the road. Unbelievable stench attendant. &nbsp; You would think that the road connecting Kuwait to Baghdad, roughly the same route Saddam marched years back, would involve a nice, four-lane interstate. And parts of it were. But mostly, it&nbsp;was worse than the back roads of Mississippi. I had neither door nor seatbelt to keep my body-armored butt in the vehicle, so spent a significant amount of energy just holding on. That and pointing my rifle out the door, ready to tear somebody's ass up if they messed with us. &nbsp; The radio consumed the rest of my effort--I had no speaker, so had to hold the handmike under the kevlar helmet the whole trip. My ear was purple when we finally arrived. But we're not there yet. &nbsp; The first flat tire hit just after the dead camel. We'd been out the gate maybe twenty minutes. It took almost an hour to change it...the truck was huge and heavy and bent the jack like a paperclip. The next flat tire hit the next day. There were six in all. And then the  coup de grace . &nbsp; "Shit, is that a  wheel  in the road?" I drove at this point, the PFC almost passed out from the heat and fatigue. Sure enough, an entire wheel spun off the road, the heaviest truck we have beached to the left of the road. Thank Allah there was no fuel truck convoy from the opposite direction at that particular moment.  &nbsp; For three hours, midday heat, we stood on the side of the road. Everyone kept both hands on weapons, fully alert despite the face-melting heat--we were, after all, in Iraq by this time.  &nbsp; The third day began with the outpost where we'd "slept" getting mortared. Time to hit the road, folks, let's move. Next, I fully exploded on a Staff Sergeant from another unit who dismounted his vehicle moments before we were to depart in order to inform me, snidely, that our trailer/big satellite dish had a tail light out. He'd been openly disrespectful the whole trip, and my Flip Mode went something like this:  "No shit, Sergeant! It's been like that for four days, jackass! Get back in your goddamn vehicle and get your head out of your ass! And take whatever personal bullshit problem you have with you!"  I think there was more as he slunk back to his truck. &nbsp; We finally arrived here. I have my own room in an air-conditioned trailer. I bought a fridge. But that is where the luxury ends. We're two miles from the chow hall. A mile to work. Three miles to the higher headquarters. No vehicles. Very hot. I'm buying a bike today. &nbsp; Three days of holding urine for hours on end to my GREAT discomfort culminated in a bladder/kidney infection that hit me like a bag of bricks yesterday. It went from "Hmm, I may have to go to sick call tomorrow" to  "Holy shit is there an emergency room around here?"  in the span of an hour. Nothing like pissing volumes of blood and suffering pain that doubles you over speechless to make you move toward the doc. &nbsp; What's next? Possibly, some days of frustration and more jackassery from my commander. I'm getting better at avoiding him entirely.

      "Um, is that an HE round?"  HE, or High Explosive--an artillery round. This question from the driver, a Specialist in my platoon and one of my favorite soldiers. We drove willy-nilly through the desert, ten Humvees, thirty personnel. We were on our way to yet another range, another day spent in the face-melting heat. If we could just get there.  The Jackass went on a recon the day before, to make sure we could get out to the range. It's notoriously hard to find, this one--out in the middle of the Kuwaiti desert. He finally found it, somehow, and now led the pack. We were already late, having wasted half an hour before we left due to a mixup with guard duty and The Jackass's having added several vehicles to the convoy without telling me.  ME, the Range Officer-In-Charge. Yeah, ME, the one who organized all this crap for the last three weeks. ME, the one who needs to know about additions to the convoy so I can get the paperwork done. See why I call him The Jackass?  But surely there is a real road that leads to this range, or what passes for a road out here--generally two little mounds on either side to guide you through the loose sand. Only out here, no guidance. Only craters and spent artillery that indicated we were in an impact zone.  At first, it was funny. The Commander has us lost and wandering like the Philistines through an impact area. Ha ha, we could get hit with a mortar.   We drove through herd of camels. Passed heavily scaled lizards as big as your leg. Turned around more than once. I instructed the soldiers in my vehicle to scan for heffalumps in homage to that Winnie the Pooh where they wander in circles through the forest.  Two hours of nudging camels and dodging lizards (but thankfully, no mortars), we arrived at the range. One of the infantry units from our brigade occupied the range off to our right about 400 meters, well visible on the desolate desert floor. The heat has become even more intense these last few days. In the afternoons, stepping out of the tent into the glare makes me think of that Nazi sumbitch on Raiders of the Lost Ark who opened the Ark, and his face ran off onto his shirt, eyeballs rolling off his chin. It literally feels as if your meat is cooking.  As we assembled the big weapons we were to shoot, I bent into a Humvee to get another bottle of water. And then there was a MASSIVE explosion. I straightened up to see sand falling about 150 meters from us, between our site and the infantry guys. Someone close to me yelled,  "What the hell was that??"    "Cease fire, cease fire, cease fire!!!"  I yelled. I was the Range Safety Officer. I got onto the radio to Range Control. The consensus among our guys was that it was a mortar round, far too big for anything we or the infantry guys fired that day.  It's a point of contention. There was a mortar platoon up the hill from us who categorically denied having fired at all. And so the range went on.   But we did notice, on passing the mortar platoon a second time on our way home, that the tubes all pointed in a different direction than they had when we'd passed them earlier.  Well, yeah, it could've been bad. But it wasn't, and makes a good story.

      No, not really. Not in this sandstorm. And I don't think we'll see any fireworks. Everyone please have an extra beer for us today and I'll catch up when I get back.  I managed to creep into my tent yesterday and spent the afternoon writing and reading a summertime trash novel:  Trading Up  by Candace Bushnell of Sex and the City fame. It's exactly what I need--a frivolous tale about some rich, hip girls in New York, driving out to the Hamptons for parties on the beach.   Talk about escapism. What, am I supposed to read  Hamlet  out here?   Still, I can't let my brain go to mush, so the next novel on the trail is Flannery O'Connor's  The Violent Must Bear it Away.  Great Southern black humor, too bad she died at 32. She would've continued to whup ass.  I have never lived well with people. Right now I'm crammed into a tattered, filthy tent with thirteen other females, and I'm the oldest one by at least ten years. I cope using earplugs and a frou-frou little blue silk eye pillow that allows me to shut off my lights whenever I get away from the Headquarters at night.   Most of these ladies, they're good people, just a bit young. But two of them just annoy the  hell  out of me--it's just this constant litany of honking, braying laughter, loud enough to shatter glass. One of them plays the I'm So Cute role, using babytalk and all other manner of nerve-grating, little-girl vernacular. The other plays Poor Me, My Life's So Hard. AND they BOTH greatly exaggerated illness and injury while we were in the desert in order to get driven back here, away from all that hard stuff. And they're both Sergeants!  Nothing annoys me more than a female soldier who feeds right into all the negative stereotypes many of our male counterparts assign us: we're lazy, we're weak, we malinger and complain.  The First Sergeant made my whole day yesterday when he told me that officers live in single-person rooms. I won't have to listen to all that blah blah blah from those two.

      I just took a blessedly long, cool shower and changed into freshly laundered and pressed DCU's after five days out in the desert. I was FILTHY. Sand ground into the scalp filthy.  I've concluded that they must've filmed the Tatooine piece of the original Star Wars here. I've never seen such a vast expanse of utter nothingness. Not a bush, not a scrub tree anywhere in view. I thought El Paso was bleak...this place looks like the surface of the moon.  But I'm satisfied. I ran five ranges in four days, successfully trained the company on a myriad of combat tasks. And the best part of each day out there was the early morning "range sweep," bearing close resemblance to a Rat Patrol remake.   It was that short period of time in this moonscape that it's actually pleasurable--the sun's just up, it's still cool, and there's a pink-purple cast on everything. My range sweeps involved my riding shotgun in a Humvee with some crusty old retired-Infantry Sergeant Major, smoking and cursing, as we hauled ass through the landscape. Felt like a bobblehead doll, almost fell out a time or two, and loved every minute of it.  The purpose of the Range Sweep is to chase off the Bedoins. Hard to imagine, in this day and age, a herd of camels sheparded by an astonishingly wiry Bedoin, accompanied by a pack mule and a dog, roaming the landscape in search of scant feed for the herd. But we chased them off the range all day, keep them from getting accidentally shot.  I'm strictly limited on time, so I have to keep this abbreviated.  There was another unit out there with us on an adjacent range, and I watched them through my binoculars as they chased a herd of sheep away...they did it differently from us though. We politely asked the shepard to move on, using gun-gestures to explain they might get shot if they stayed. Usually worked just fine. These jackasses, however, barreled right into this poor man's herd. I SAW them run over a lamb.  I was PISSED.  I saw the Lieutenant, a guy I've dealt with here from time to time. I asked him, "Hey, did ya'll just  run over  that guy's flock???"  He smirked. "I think we scared one, it might've had a heart attack."  I stared at him for a moment. "No wonder they hate us, you jackass," I said, then walked away.  I can't abide arrogant American assholes. Period.

      I haven't posted lately for two reasons: I am so short on time that I never get more than four hours of sleep a night, and I didn't/don't have anything nice to say.  The last few days have been utter hell on earth. I cannot even look the commander in the eye, I hate him so much. It's been so long since I've dropped off or picked up laundry, I'm on the Third Wearing of the Socks. It's 6:30 on Sunday morning, I've been here since five,  and I won't get to leave until well after midnight tonight. And am  required  to be in by five. Seven days a week. For the next ten + months. And the late nights will not go away.  My short-term memory is gone. I couldn't remember the word for that thing you write when you come in from a mission, oh yeah, a REPORT. It literally took thirty seconds to come up with that word. This was last night. I think.  Just now I caught a glimpse of myself in the chow hall mirror as I washed my hands. I look like a drug addict--red, glassy eyes (with black circles, very glamorous), hair in disarray, pale skin.  The one bright spot in my week came two nights ago, unexpectedly, when I finished a six-hour meeting with the Men With Rank, and the sweet man I've mentioned before had gotten my dinner. Steak, a salad, and cookies, in a go-box on my desk with a little note about how he'd noticed I hadn't eaten.  It sounds like a tiny gesture, but at that moment, I was moved nearly to tears. I'll take all the wee kindnesses I can get right now, and make an effort to push some out myself. I gave my two soldiers the morning off and that's why I'm here now. Stuff like that. I can't let the vitriol filter down. I must be the shit filter. Does it make my life hell? Yes, it does. Is it the right thing to do? Yes, it is.  But I can only take so much. Two nights ago, the commander yanked me out of bed (I'd been asleep maybe an hour and it took several minutes of pounding before I woke up...normally, someone can sneeze in China and I'm wide awake) in order to chew my ass about something someone else had lost in the shuffle. He actually grabbed me by the elbow and started to walk me outside. I violently yanked my arm away, levelled my hand at him sideways, and furiously told him  Do NOT touch me. Do not EVER touch me. In ANY context. Now, what is it that you WANT?     He looked a little taken aback, but at least had the sense to ease off. Because had he reared up and pulled rank, I would have taken the gloves off and unloaded on him, both barrels. It's coming. I've already decided I don't care about my evaluation reports, he can't take my rank away (I wish he would, though, honestly), and I sense that if the shit hit the fan and everything came out, he'd be relieved of command.  Bring it on , you caustic, pompous, bitter, nihilistic piece of shit.    And to put the icing right up on the cake? My fellow lieutenant, Shayla, the one I've always had mixed feelings about but had decided to get along with at all costs? Has stabbed me in the back several times now. I can't even look at her. Any slim chance we might be friends is forever lost.  However, I must be doing something right because the Colonel, the Big Boss, publicly speaks very highly of me. As does his deputy commander, a Lieutenant Colonel. I brief them and the rest of the Brigade Staff every day, and I do it well.  I'm good at my job. I just don't  like  it much right now.

      It's 10pm, I've been here since 5:30am, with no end in sight. It's been this way for over a week. I'm so sleep-deprived, I hallucinated on the walk home last night. A piece of white toilet paper fluttering on the ground became a serpent. Albino, I suppose, but a serpent nonetheless. I jump and yelped. I'm glad no one was around.  Actually, I was even  more  glad no one was around to witness my stress-induced tantrum moments later in the shower. Having worked that insane schedule for many days in a row, I can't exactly remember when my last shower took place. I'm thinking it was three days prior. But last night, I reached my filth threshold and sacrificed a half-hour of sleep for a shower. So imagine how pissed I was when I reached for the knobs, naked, shampoo in hand, and there was  no water.      I cursed. I threw things. Slammed doors. Then went about fixing the problem...threw switches in the fuse box, turned knobs on the pump, still naked as a jaybird and not giving a tinker's damn. And finally, something went right and the pump started working.  I was still pissed, though, and muttered furiously all through the shower and kept it up stomping back to my room.  There's nothing wrong with me that a full night's sleep wouldn't fix. I'm only able to keep this blog updated because the Boss isn't around and we finally have an unclassified computer in the Dungeon.  I miss my queen-sized sleigh bed with the fine sheets and thick down comforter. I miss the ceiling fan's sweet breeze. I miss waking up to sunlight in the room and the sound of traffic outside the Park where I live. I miss my kitchen. And the front porch with the cheap chairs I bogarted from Dad's house that actually look great and are quite comfortable when you pull one up to the railing, put your feet up, and read for the late afternoon as the cats chase each other on the front lawn. I just plain miss  home .
