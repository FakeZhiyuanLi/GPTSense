           I am definitely a kind of person who truly hates a guy who has more than one girlfriend. I get sad when I learned from a friend that their boyfriends fool them! Sucks! Men are born polygamous. Why men have no satisfaction? I have always thought that no man is a ONE-WOMAN MAN! Until on July 21st of 2003, there was training that I need to attend. That day was not an ordinary day for me; I felt bad because my mother & I exchanged words on the 20th. But I wasn’t expecting that 21st of July will change my entire life. That I will gonna meet the man that I will love till the last day of my life, or I may say my eternity.       I was in my hometown then in Davao. I was connected in an I.T. company during that time. I was the last person, who came to that function room for the training, that was held in Mandaya Hotel, if I am not mistaken that was almost ten in the morning. When I entered the room with shame, I was a bit surprised when a guy introduced himself to me without hesitant. He is one of the three conductors of the training. He was very approachable. His name wasn’t clear to me then, until I sat &amp; saw their business cards on the table. The name is so unique. He was the first speaker & then there’s another two. I can say that he was the best speaker among the three of them. The training ran for about 3 hours. I was truly bored. I have no interest of listening to what the speaker is talking all about except for the first speaker. All I am thinking then was my mom, my mom &amp; my mom. Whew! I was so thankful that it was already past twelve in the afternoon. The training is over. He approached me again & asks if I have a business card? I don’t have business card at that time because I was just a week hired to that company (sayang!). I felt a lil “kilig” when he get his extra business card &amp; asks me to write my mobile number, my email address & my office address then. I also wrote what he asks. But I felt sad because he was asking for everybody’s business cards, also the girls, and felt sadder because he forgot to get my improvised business card. I thought he has no interest of getting it at all.     We had our free lunch, but I don’t really wanna eat lunch with them, I’d rather go back to our office than to have lunch with no one I could talk to. I was the only representative from my former company that’s why I don’t feel at is, unlike the other company who also attended the training, it seems they let all their people to be present (ok lang free naman lunch eh, buffet pa!). But I have no choice but to mingle with them. Its time to eat our lunch. I was not thinking anymore of my shame. All I know that I was starving. I sat beside the guy who approached me when I entered the function room (He invited me to sit beside him, but he is in denial). We had little talks, like we’ve known each other for a very long years &amp; I never expecting that I will feel at ease in that short period of time (click kami). And finally, he asks for my improvised business card again (naalala pa pala, kala ko kinalimutan na!). That was the first greatest lunch I ever had with a guy (promise!).     We get back to the function room to get our things. I thank all of his companions with a handshake. The approachable guy was not there. He is standing beside the door, didn’t even say goodbye, he just smile. I don’t know what happened to him, after a great lunch & talks together. The changes were so abrupt. I tried not to think of him anymore.      It’s two in the afternoon when I get back in the office. I was so happy when I received a message from him; I am not expecting it anyway. They are in the airport; they’ll be leaving Davao & need to go back to Manila. I felt lonely because I never met a guy like him who is very down to earth, &amp; so gentleman.     21st of July 2003, that was past ten in the evening. I was at home already & lying down in bed. I can’t still forget the conversation I had with this wonderful guy. I was totally feel like I’m flying when I received a message from him (he is missing me na daw). I know it is no stir, I felt it deep inside my heart though we’ve just met once. He is truly different among the other guys I’ve met…he is different.    He courted me; I believe that he is sincere. I didn’t let him court for a long time. I told him that I also love him, though, the relationship we have is what you call a long distance relationship. Most people, friends, & even officemates keeps telling us that our relationship will never gonna work. They keep telling us “nag-lolokohan lang kayo!” We want to prove them they are all wrong. We have a strong faith that in God’s time we will be together. We will be happy, no matter how hard life is. I kept praying to God &amp; ask his sign if this guy is the ONE I’ve been waiting for so long. And my prayers have always had an answer, and it is a Yes!      After two months. I can no longer wait to be with him. I have decided to go to manila to be with him, I’ve ask God’s sign. I don’t have any money to buy plane ticket. I’m desperate. I am dying to be with my one & only love. I want to hug him for real… I asked God if I can’t get any money or any work from manila before the month of September 2003, it means it’s not yet time for us to be together. But truly prayer is so powerful. I’ve got both. At long last, “kapaling ko na s’ya.”       Now, I can say that my fiancé is the best example that there is still guy who could stick to one (mas konti nga lang, kesa sa mga mahihilig—sa babae!). I’m so blessed that I am one of those lucky women who found a guy like him. A kind of guy women cannot afford to lose. Thanks God! Though there are so many problems that cannot be avoided. We both know that we can get through it… just always have faith in God, have trust &amp; respect with each other, have a good communication. Listen! True love will come into your life once. Be aware of it. Always ask God’s guidance. He is the only one who knows what is best for you.      ***This is for my mahal Russer. I was never inspired like this in my entire life. Thanks for your unconditional love.    ***happy reading! Hope you’ll like it. ---sche_1423 August 20, 2004 22:14 Friday

      Team USA 2004 is NOT the dream team. Yes, I repeat, they are NOT the dream team.  So why are so many people comparing them to the dream team?? I mean this bunch has more youngsters versus the previous dream teams that's why. They lack maturity and the court inteliigence than the 90's dream team had.  Reasons why they are not as doiminant as their predecessors are:   Olympics is August. They were just formed last July.   They lack the best players in th "L". Imagine a starting five of Kobe, T-Mac, Shaq, KG & TD..  Their average age is 23 yrs old. Very unlike the dream team of MJ, Magic &amp; Larry back then...  They cant hit threes...   So there you are. Even though they are not the best, I still think they can win the "G". Lets just hope they get their act together fast. Lets just see.
