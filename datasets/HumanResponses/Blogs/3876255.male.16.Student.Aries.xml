       urlLink    "And he finally found himself at the memorial.  He removed his hat, and he gazed.  He peered into the cold, black stone as if his life were dependant upon it.  He stared into the list of names, his eyes darting back and forth, searching for that one name that belonged to his only true friend.  Memories flushed back into his mind - memories that had been drowned out and tucked away for years.  He could barely control the urge to collapse and weep into the tiny cracks of the stone-covered ground.  And yet, he felt comforted.  He felt warm.  He felt happy for the first time in a very, very long time, for now he knew that he was not the only person who remembered."  This picture was taken in Washington, D.C. and edited in Photoshop 7.

      Before that, though, take a look at this  urlLink service  Google used to provide.  I had no idea.  Anyway, as for the updates, I have done a lot to this site over the past few days.  Here's the low-down:   Added new polls.   Added ability to view results of polls without voting.   Added new links.   Added easy access to Atom Feed.   Added new RSS 2.0 Feed from FeedBurner (thanks!).   Added Google search of site and web.   Added a Thanks section.   Added the Site Meter service.  There's one problem that I'm having, though, with the link to Jinx Hackwear in the Links section.  It's hard for me to make the image show up on the page.  Does anyone else have this problem?  I mean, do you see the image for Jinx in the Links section or not?  Leave a comment, if you feel like being nice to me.  If this doesn't get fixed in a day or so, I'll just replace the image with a text link.  I plan to keep on updating and stuff, just as every good little boy and girl should.  It's the proper thing to do, you know?  Keep checking back to see what wondrous and astounding things I do to this site, and, of course, to read this amazing content I type up for all to see.  You wouldn't believe how many hours I've spent working on this.  And, in addition to you benefitting from my hours of work, I have also gained quite a bit of knowledge about CSS and other parts of the web design involved with this blog.  I'm very happy about this, and you should be too.  It's a shame no one reads this.

      Yeah, so what?  It's not like you've never done it before, you big, fat, hypocritical banana.  What am I supposed to do about it, though?  I go to a school where just about 78% or more of the kids smoke, I live in a location near a paper mill, and I stay cooped up in my room all day.  Lots of bad particles enter my nasal cavities, and I have to get that stuff out one way or another.  It's just my choice to stick my finger up in there and dig it all out.  Don't get the wrong idea, though.  I'm not a public picker.  I just do it in the privacy of my own home, and other places where I (hopefully) can't be seen.  Sadly though, the life of a nose-picker can be a harsh one.  When I was in first grade, I was ignorant and I was stupid.  I didn't know about so-called "tissues."  All I knew that day was that I had something in my nose, and my fingers were small enough to fit up there.  The class was lining up to go home for the day.  I was breathing normally, until I felt the pesky little nuisance clinging to the inside of my nostril.  I didn't know that picking was wrong because I was home-schooled in Kindergarten, and I hadn't yet faced the dilemma of how to react to a booger in a room filled with twenty children.  Because of this, I just reached up and * cringe * picked my nose.  Along comes teacher.  " What are you doing, Matthew?  Get a tissue right now! " screamed Teacher.  I thought to myself, "What is this?  I'm being scolded for taking care of my bodily needs?  How passe!"  But I am generally obedient, so I reached into my backpack and retrieved my pocket-sized packet of Kleenexes.  I took one out of the pack, opened it up, placed it around the top of my finger, and stuck my finger back up my nose in an effort once again to remove the dried nasal mucus.  Apparently, Teacher was still not satisfied.  Was it my fault I couldn't properly operate a tissue?  I think not.  " Matthew, if you don't stop picking your nose, I am going to send you to the Office! " exclaimed the angry female staring harshly at me from what seemed like miles above my head.  I had no idea as to what I should do.  I was in a room packed with vicious pre-teens ready to rip me apart for any non-cool thing I did, I was being yelled at by an adult who controlled my grades, and I was being assaulted internally by a wad of mucus unwilling to cease its tickling of my nose.  I decided to just forget trying to pick my nose in favor of getting on the bus and going home.  Later that night, I consulted my mother as to the proper use of a tissue and I learned the wonderful technique of nose-blowing.  The psychiatrist bills mount ever-higher.

       urlLink    This is the last picture I'll post for a little while.  I need to go to bed.  Why am I not yet in bed?!?!  I just spent the whole day riding in the back of an old, cramped van, and my body is begging me for rest, but my stupid desire to post here is preventing me from getting any unconscious time to myself.  Anyway, about the picture, this is some building near where my hotel was in NY.  I thought it looked mighty neato and I also thought it would make a great wallpaper.  If any of you want a nice, full-quality, 1280-by-960 pixel version of this picture for your desktop, just leave a comment with your e-mail addy like I said in that other post and I'll send it direct to ya, spam not included.

       urlLink    I like this one because those buildings look so cool, towering above all of the other puny, weakling buildings.  It's as if they were ready for lunch, but someone stole their peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, so now they're totally pissed and they want some revenge.  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  That's right,  cage match .  I can hear the commercials now...  "The steel cage:  the deadliest arena known to mankind, the ultimate foe of so many up-and-coming wrestlers, and the ultimate victory palace of the conquerors.  But what will the 'Scrapers bring into this terrifying mixture of blood, guts, and sweat?  We can only imagine..."  Contact Ticketmaster for details.

       urlLink    This is an energy-wave capture (a.k.a. "photo") of the American flag sitting high atop its majestic pole.  I took this by standing at the bottom of the pole and pointing the camera straight up.  In the picture, the sky looks a tad overcast, and that was the case for much of the vacation.  It wasn't all that bad, though, because it made things a lot less hot and sweaty for me, and it didn't really rain all that much.  Oh, two things I didn't mention before:  1.) I have larger versions of all of these pictures (full-screen versions) if anyone would like them, and 2.) you can get a slightly larger version by clicking on the thumbnail right up there, but it won't be the largest available size.  If you want the largest version, leave a comment on one of the posts giving me your e-mail address and telling me which one you want.  By the way, they are free.  I'm not yet good enough to charge for my pictures.  They make nice wallpapers, though.

       urlLink    Here's one of my early attempts at political photography.  See, it's cool because the cup says, "Take Pride In America," but it's ironic because the cup is all messed up and it was just thrown into the street like that, with not much pride at all.  I think I did pretty well in my first attempt at political photography.  Political photography is a very difficult field to pursue, and there were many times during the half-second it took me to take that picture in which I thought to myself, "Why are you even doing this?  There is no future in this.  You'd better get off the street before that Escalade hits you."

      Just kidding.  urlLink    Here's a nice picture of a building we saw on our trip in Maryland.  I have no idea of what it is called or anything else about it, other than the fact that my mom liked the style of it.  I think this is a pretty cool picture, and I give it a thumbs up.  I would be proud to wear a shirt with this picture printed on it.  I would wear the shirt to the grocery store, and to a restaurant, and maybe even to a concert or two.  That's how much I enjoy looking at this picture.  If you feel the same as I do about this photograph, raise your hands a few inches into the air and proclaim your feelings!  Because, and this is the important part folks, we all have to learn to get along with each other someday, and how will we do that without shirts?

      Wow, I'm back and I'm still alive.  In case you are just now joining me on my blogging adventure, I was recently away on a trip to Washington, D.C. and New York.  Hey, what's that?  Oh, it's a big fat barrel of complaints!  Let's open it!  Well, the first thing that made my trip sort of un-fun was my body's intolerance of any physical activity.  As a lot of people know, DC and NY are places where the main mode of transportation is walking, and where I live (NC), that is not the case.  Therefore, I had quite a time venturing throughout our vacation destinations, and I am lucky that I had a little pile of tissues in my pocket at all times which I used to mop up the sweat on my forehead every four seconds.  Maybe I lost some weight.  The next thing to make my vacation not meet my (already low) expectations was my step-dad.  Heh, I've never liked him since the beginning anyway.  He is pretty much an immature high-schooler's mind inside a 56-year-old's body.  I only wish I could be as easily entertained by farts and burps as is he.  And in addition to the Make-Stupid-Immature-Jokes section of a high-schooler's mind, he also comes complete with the Bully section.  We were eating breakfast at some cruddy bagel shop in Silver Spring, MD and I got up to go to the bathroom, but while getting up, I accidentally knocked the table a little bit.  It didn't fall over or even move that much; it just sort of jumped a bit.  However, my step-dad chose to display his awe-inspiring maturity by stating the following to me:  "Boy, you'd better be glad you didn't do that, or you'd have had a lot of fight on your hands."  I don't know what you guys think, but if I were eligible for the Senior Citizen's Discount at Golden Corral, I wouldn't go around challenging teenagers to fights.  Another incident with Step-Daddy occurred when we were about to take a bus tour through Brooklyn.  One of his favorite sayings is, "Nip it in the butt," so when we had a slight difficulty locating the right bus, he decided to nip several consecutive butts by skipping everyone in line in order to find the bus driver.  He started some type of hysterical dance and was querying the driver as to whether or not the bus was the correct one, and the driver politely replied that it was indeed the right one.  Well, Father-Of-Stairs kept on dancing and started yelling at my mom, who was in the back of the line at the time waiting patiently, to come to the front with him.  The driver of the bus asked him to calm down and relax, but Step kept on telling my mom to come to the front, and this cycle continued until she finally came.  I was at the front of the line with him while all this was happening, and I, unlike him, recognized the fellow human beings standing behind us.  I turned around and apologized to them a few times, and they all said it was okay, and everything calmed down, and we had an enjoyable tour with a great tour guide.  However, for the rest of the trip, Daddy-Step ranted about how he was just about to give that guy a "five-knuckle sandwich" and whatever else he could think of that had a twenty-year-old, worn-out, unfunny joke in it.  And the thing that makes me mad is the fact that he knows he probably wasn't going to do anything, and two things would have happened if he had tried something:  1.) He would have gotten himself and all of us thrown off the tour, which was quite expensive by the way, and 2.) He would have gotten the smack-down from the bus driver, who looked a lot more physically-fit than Step-Dad.  All of this just shows what a bully he is, and I really don't like that.  There are several other things wrong with him, but I won't continue because I know that I am certainly not perfect, and I have no right to complain about him.  Also, I always end up feeling badly for him after I have gotten over my angry spurts because I know that he is old and he is just trying to hang onto his youth, however little he may have left of it.  Even though it may sound like I hate him, I don't like to actually get angry at him because I am really a nice person and I don't want him to feel like the rest of us (me, my mom, and my brother) are ganging up on him.  I am in quite a hard spot here.  I guess if he ever does anything else really terrible, I can write about it here, and that will make me feel better.  Until then, I'll leave him alone.  Golly, I'm sorry people.  There's nothing interesting in this post.  I guess it's just because I'm trying to straighten everything out that's happened over the past week.  Stay in touch, though, because I'm planning on posting some pictures from the trip.  Thanks for your time and dedication to my blog.

      Durn, that last post was terrible.  I guess it's not too interesting to read about someone else's vacation plans, is it?  I can't help it, though.  I felt as if I had to explain why I will most likely not post here from July 10 to July 17 (those are the days we'll be gone).  I only write good stuff while it's raining, and it's not raining right now, so all of my writing sucks oranges.  In an effort to prove to you that my blog is worth reading, I'll go back to the roots of the blogging world, and I'll attempt to describe to you everything that is prancing around my troubled mind as of this very moment.  I am so sick and tired of this crud.  It's as if my fan doesn't even know that I want it to blow on me.  I know that my bed is covered with suitcases, and I suppose they could be blocking the air coming from the fan, but it's just so inconsiderate of the fan to not even think about my temperature-related needs.  The only reason I carried it's sorry base home from Wal-Mart is the fact that I was hot at the time, and I needed some constant air flow.  The girl at the gas station down the road didn't seem willing to come to my room to blow on me.  She said it sounded "gross," but I just needed some air, that's all.  And now that I finally have something to blow on me whenever I want it to, it doesn't seem to be in the "mood."  You know, that's just like a fan.  I shouldn't have even expected anything good out of that thing.  I knew from the very beginning that we wouldn't be a good match.  And now I have to take a bath, because I am all hot and sweaty, and I stink.  Because nothing blew on me.  Okay, the next post will be better, becuase it will be later at night and I am a lot more emotional at night.  You can go to the toilet now, if you so desire.

      Heh, that's a funny definition for the word, "trip," is it not?  Nevertheless, it's not the one with which I'm concerned right now.  The only meaning of "trip" that is in my mind right now is, "Leisure time away from work or school; devoted to rest or pleasure."  That's right, it's trip time.  Baby.  Yeah.  My family and I are going to Washington, D.C. tomorrow.  That means I get to ride in the back of the family van all by myself and enjoy my music and enjoy my magazines and enjoy my breath mints whilst I enjoy staring out the window into nothingness.  I like time to myself, because I'm insane.  I'm going to get caught up with all of the reading I should have been doing the past two years.  I have somewhere in the area of five billion magazines that I need to read, and I'm a member of an ever-so wonderful science fiction book club, from which I have obtained many books that I have yet to read.  Reading doesn't seem like such a huge part of my life now like it once used to be.  Of course, I now have more important things to do, like talk to you and pick my nose with tire irons.  Stoop-o-rific, spin-doodalee-astic.  Trip time.  I'm gonna trip.  Dude.  And then, the next stop will be the place that we all love.  You probably have a tee shirt in your closet proclaiming your love for the location.  Yep, we are going to New York.  I've never been there, and I am looking forward to it, but I don't think the van will enjoy getting hit so many times by the cabbies.  I heard from someone once that they aren't too careful about stuff like that.  Does anyone here have any knowledge as to whether or not this is a fact?  Will I get killed by a cab driver in New York?  What if I'm allergic to apples?  Right now, my eardrums are vibrating their hairs off with the sounds of Aphrodite's Drum and Bass remix of "The Luniz - I Got Five On It."  I seem to have recently acquired a taste for the D&B style.  I just like to imagine that I'm doing the remixing in the auditorium at my school and all of the students are there cheering me on and drinking soda-pop, because when I do remixes, I sell soda-pop, and that's just what I do.  And then, when I do a really cool drum solo, I get bombarded with artifacts from the crowd.  Artifacts = bras and panties.

      Don't worry about this post; nothing intellectual or astounding here.  I'm just being sneaky and using the "Hello" program to upload a picture to the Google servers for me so that I can use it as my picture in my profile.  I don't know if that's how the makers of it intended for it to be used, but if they have a problem with it, they can shoot me with the Golden Gun from that James Bond movie.  And we all know that they aren't going to do that.  Anyway, it's past my bedtime.  It was past my bedtime six hours ago.  I think I need to go to bed, but I'm a teenager, so I find myself here yet again, listening to Usher on my music player and typing to all of my imaginary friends.  I never had a chance to type to my imaginary friends when I was little, so I need to take every opportunity I can get now that I can do so.  My foot is asleep.  I never knew it would be like this when I was younger...  when I was more innocent.  I never knew that I would someday be sitting on my grey chair in front of my computer with my left leg scrunched up underneath my whole body.  I thought I would have a great time with both of my feet, but I'm sitting here at 3:54 am with only one functional foot, and I don't know what my life has come to.  I mean, how in the world did I let this happen?  I could have moved my foot so as to keep it from falling asleep.  I could have gotten up to go to the fridge for some soda, and that would have done the trick.  But no.  I did not....

      This post refers to  urlLink this other post .  I know that I probably shouldn't respond to my own posts, and I'll try not to do it from now on, but I have to respond to such a nice comment as yours,  urlLink Rachel . As I was looking over my newly created blog a moment ago, I just happened to glance at the comment counter of each post I had made, and, *ta-da!*, I saw a comment on  urlLink this post ! I thought to myself, "Oh, the horror! Someone saw my eye, and that person must not have approved! I know it!" But then, I clicked on the comment link, and there was yours, in all its glory. My heart thrust itself from my throat, which is where it had previously been, and settled back down into my chest, because not only did I get a comment within one day of having a blog, but it was a positive comment! As my peers like to say, "woot!" Rachel, thank you. Seriously, no one has ever said anything about my eyes. I guess it may be because I wear glasses, but you, ma'am, found beauty in the ugly duckling that is me, Matthew, and I will remember that.

      My land, I am so picky.  I keep on pondering over the stupidest little things.  I'll tell you those things now, in the hopes that you wil ponder them as well, and maybe our collective pondering will force the universe into revealing some sort of an answer to me.  Here are my problems:  1. I can't decide if I should have the closing ellipsis (the four dots) at the end of the title of this blog ("And it seems like... rain....") or just have nothing ("And it seems like... rain").  I want it to seem, you know, mysterious and whatnot, but I can't decide which form of puncuation, or non-punctuation, I guess, would be best to convey this deep emotion to my readers.  2. I'm hiding behind a crude and rusty veil of lies.  Why?  Because my name is not "Matt."  I am called, in reality, Matthew.  I'm sorry that I have mislead you, dear reader, up to this point, but I have reasons for this action, and I would like to present them for your review.  You see, in this world of baggy pants and backward-facing hats, the highest goal for many is to appear "cool" and "desirable," and sometimes even "sane."  In an attempt to do this, I gathered up from my real name what were unnecessary letters in my opinion, and I tossed them aside in the hopes of updating my appearance and seeming more cool.  I am a teenager, and that's what this world has told me to do.  However, am I listening to my heart?  My heart tells me, "Matthew, why do you deny your true name?  You have never been a 'Matt,' and you never will be.  You know good and well that your parents had seven distinct letters in mind when they told the birth-certificate-writer what to put on your birth certificate."  I respond to that remark by eating five bags of potato chips in order to make my heart suffer for what it has said to me.  And yet I still do not know what to do.  Is the blood-sucking mass of tissue inside my chest cavity correct, or should I listen to what the pot-smokers and jump-rope-jumpers at my school tell me?  I'm sad now.  I don't know how I am going to get into my pajamas and go to bed tonight.  My problems weigh me down.  I smell fish.  --   Update:   I took the plunge and listened to my heart.  I basically had to, because the sneaky little critter threatened to give me a nosebleed, and I don't have any tissues handy.  So from now on, until I change my mind again, I will be known as Matthew on this blog, and on Neptune.  Thanks for the consideration.

      The Graham Norton Effect is on Comedy Central right now and they are talking about cologne.  Such awesomeness.  I wish I had some cologne so that I could start an entire conversation about it.  Oh, and I would also like some celebrities sitting here next to me with which to do the conversing.  That would be nice.  Alas, I have no cologne, nor do I have celebrities.  I just got off the phone a little while ago with one of my friends from school who I had not talked to in a while.  He was telling me how he got a job working on cars with his uncle over the summer.  I told him I am an Online Editor.  He asked what I edit.  I told him, "Bye."  He's never heard of that online newspaper.  Neither have I.  Hey, here's a  urlLink plug .  Go visit Annie and her Amazing Works of Art.  Seriously, she's good.  Stop boring me.  I'm just kidding, you know I love you :)  Who else will waste countless hours sitting here and reading the stupid stuff that I write?  Just to show you that I care about you as well, I'll post something else here within a week.  Maybe.  Back to Norton.

       urlLink    I just thought the general public would like to know how my eyeball looks.  I know that certainly is one of my requirements when I meet someone new.  And since you all can't see me in person, what better way is there than for me to post a good old picture of my sight sphere on the Internet?  That's right; there is no better way.  If you look closely, you can see the camera reflecting off the center of my ball.

      Woot, dialup is so awesome.  I'm curently downloading "Hello," the program that is supposed to let me publish photos to this blog for free.  It seems to be cool so far, but I haven't yet used it due to my slow-as-butt, over-the-phone-line-with-no-filters modem.  It's only 78% done dowloading.  As soon as it's finished, I'll be happy, because I frequently fantasize about my donwloads completing problem-free.  It's a rarity.  Expect pictures in the future.  Or not.  I will probably drop this blogging thing in a few days, because I can never seem to commit to something like this.  Maybe it will work out, though.  One can hope.

      I love being generic and doing the same thing as everyone else, so I thought I'd make a blog.  Just kidding about that.  You can't blame me for wanting to make a blog.  I mean, why not let everyone know stuff about me?  Anyway, back to the subject of this blog, "Hello."  My name's Matt, and I like breath mints.  So there's my introduction.  About my day today, I woke up late.  I didn't get up until about 1:00, which was when my stepdad called me from town to ask me a question about a computer he wants.  Sometimes it sucks to be the only one in the house who is computer-literate.  I don't care, though, because once he buys a new computer, I will hopefully get his old Compaq.  I'm going to stick it in my closet along with my other broken, messed up, ancient junk.  I save all of my family's old electronics.  But hey, who knows when I may need a, umm, broken voice coil?  After that, I took a bath (mmmm, fresh and clean...) and I was about to go to my local library when my  urlLink friend  called and said he was coming over.  While he was here, a big ol' rainstorm came up and the power flicked off a few times, but I managed to live.  We talked about what we want to be when we grow up.  I have no idea, because every single person in the world is better at everything than I am.  You yourself are probably better at bungie jumping than I am.  Why?  Because I have never been bungie jumping, and I don't plan on doing it anytime soon.  Thanks for the concern.  Conan O'Brien is on right now.  I like watching his show, because it's on television and I like watching television occasionally.  I'm going to mess with the layout of this blog now, I guess.  I need to make it look superly-duperly fantastic, just like  urlLink Lily  says.  Lily is cool.
