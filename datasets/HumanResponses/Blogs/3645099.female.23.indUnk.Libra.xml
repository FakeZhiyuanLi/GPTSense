      I know we need it, but can it just stop for 5 seconds? This off and on crap that's been going on for the past 2 1/2 weeks is officially getting on my nerves. My hair doesn't handle this very well and neither do my sinuses and allergies.   On a side note, I saw the Notebook for the second time. Yes, it just came out this weekend, but I saw a sneak preview a couple weeks ago. I've only done the same movie in one weekend once before with Mr. Deeds opening weekend. It was worth it.

      Naps are few and far between for me. In high school, I was convinced that we should have nap time like all the kindergarteners have. Not fair. Many times I have gone out to my car during my hour break at work to try and take a nap. It's too hot to do that now, but it was good while it lasted. It's not that I don't get enough sleep at night because normally I do. I think it's just that I need a 20 minute power nap to get me refreshed. I rarely get naps now. I came home from work early today because I wasn't feel well and I took a 4 1/2 hour nap! That's craziness! I have just been exhausted lated. Not sure what that is related to. It was good while it lasted though...

      1. Be of the male sex and wear jean shorts. Denim shorts were popular in the 80's, but this is one fad that will never come back. Period. What's even worse is when take tight jeans, cut them off and make them shorts. This should never be done-Ever! It's bad enough that everytime I go to a Braves game all male-jean short wearers come out of the woodwork.  2. Sit on the same side of the table/booth when out with your significant other by yourselves. This is different if you're with another couple. If you are by yourself, please sit across from your loved one. No one wants to see you turned toward the other person the whole time making googly eyes. Sit across from them and you can look at them the whole time.  3. Sit in the middle of a bench seat in a truck while you're boyfriend/husband is driving. There are those couples that can bare to have 2 feet in-between them in a truck. It's annoying.   I'm obviously not speaking for everyone here, but I'm sure a lot of you out there would agree....

      This is the first week in I don't know how long that I have absolutely nothing to do (besides work). I'm such a planner and I usually like to plan things in advance, but I also have a spontaneous streak in me. It's just been fun to lay in my bed and watch t.v., and not have any commitments.   This weekend I plan to go watch The Notebook again. The fact that I think the movie is better than the book says something about the movie. Besides the fact that Ryan Gosling is HOTTT, the movie is just so intense. It's great. If every love story was like that....man....

      I'm the dork who had music from Oliver, Oklahoma!, Annie, and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory blaring from my car with the windows down on Friday.   I saw 5 bands play this weekend. I love going to concerts. Saturday night was The Get Up Kids, Thrice, and Dashboard Confessional. Last night it was Red Letter Agent and Jump Little Children. So fun. I just bought 3 CD's on my break. Music is such an outlet for me. It makes the hour long drive to and from work so much more relaxing. I just pop in a CD and relax. I can't wait until my friends that just started new bands start playing again. That's always fun to go out and support your friends. Maybe my love of music comes from my mom making me and my brother take piano lessons when we were younger. I cannot express how thankful I am to my mom for making us do that. I can read music plus play it by ear. It's made me be able to play other instruments a lot easier. Music is such therapy for me. There's little else that I like better than coming home to an empty house and banging on the piano for an hour or two. I get lost in playing music. I also love to lay in my bed with the lights low just listening to music. I love so many types of music too (some more than others). I love classical (I will blare that too-no shame), Bluegrass (grew up on it), Rock, Hip-Hop....most everything. I'll listen to anything once.

      That being said, I went to a wedding yesterday for a guy that I work with. It was a beautiful wedding and they did a great job with everything. However, it completely drove the point home that I'm completely non-traditional when it comes to what I want for my wedding. For me, it's weird hearing all of these girls say that they've dreamed about their wedding since they were a little girl, etc. I haven't. Maybe I'm abnormal or something, but I've really truly only recently thought about this and that's just because people all around me are getting married. I've officially decided that I want to get married on the beach (I'm not talking Panama City-I'm thinking the Carribbean). I want to have whoever wants to go with us to the beach to come and have a good time. For those that can't come, we'll have a huge party afterwards when we get back. I don't want to have to deal with any stress when it comes to my wedding, I don't want to have to plan a whole bunch of stuff, and I just want to enjoy the day.   Now, once I'm done seeing the world and having fun in life, maybe a guy will come into my life. I'm honestly hoping at this point to not get married until I'm 30. There is still so much I want to do in life (case and point-the going back to school to get another degree and changing careers that I'm doing right now.) I know you can't plan this stuff, but I'm not one of those girls sitting on my butt waiting for a guy. I'm out there enjoying life and enjoying friends

      For whatever reason in my family, we haven't grown up with many traditions. Maybe part of this reason is because we usually had to go out of town to visit family for holidays, but I'm not really sure. I've already decided that when I have my own family, we're going to have so many traditions that my kids are going to hate me. Okay, not really, but I think it's essential for kids to have some traditions. I'm also going to have family vacations every year. I guess that means I have to live somewhat close to my parents when I'm older so we don't have to go out of town to visit them all of the time.

      Why is it that I always think of the most random things in the bathroom. Whether I'm going to the bathroom or taking a shower, the most random thoughts enter my mind. I sometimes think of the most random people that I haven't seen in years. Take today for instance. For some reason, 6th grade came into my head today. I was thinking about this kid, Chris Scales, whose red locker was above mine 2nd from the left end. This kid drove me crazy. He was always dropping his books on my head and he was ridiculously messy. He was one of those people that had 100 different papers sticking out of every book. Then that thought led to my remembering how we use to wrap all of our friends' lockers for their birthdays in 6th grade. I remember mine getting wrapped with yellow Where's Waldo? paper. Ahhh....those were the days.   Just FYI, if you read my previous post you saw how I get annoyed when people pull out in front of me when there is no one behind me. It happened again today in the same spot. Grrrr...  On a side note, I officially have DSL for my home computer now compliments of my brother and his roommate. It was irratating not having the internet at home for a month, but that kind of makes me sound spoiled. It's not the I'm spoiled, it's just the mear fact that I was use to having high-speed internet for the past two years since I've been on the own and then when it's taken away from me, I wasn't use to it.

      I just wanted to make a comment on every person that feels the need to pull out directly in front of me causing me to break quickly when there is NO ONE BEHIND ME. Just wait until I pass by, then pull out. It's annoying.  Enough about that. I downloaded itunes by Apple at work and I am constantly listening to XM radio through it. It's free and wonderful, what more is there in life? I'm usually listening to one of the 20 80's stations they have. They play good music and they have every type of music available to listen to with NO commercials. It's great. AND...a lot of the stations will show you at the top who the artist is and the title of the song. That's so much better than regular radio stations that rarely say either. Just thought I would pass this info along in case anyone else wanted to get in on this awesome site.

      I went to bed at 10:30 last night because I was exhausted. Maybe it's because I moved back home and it takes me right at an hour one way to go to work so I'm getting up earlier and getting home later now. I refuse to have no life now that I've moved back home. I'm a pretty social person and I like being around friends. One of the bigger cons about moving home is that I can't have people over as much as I did. However, my parents are extremely accomodating to me moving back. It's not a huge hassle and I appreciate the fact that they are supporting me going back to school. For those of you that don't know, I have officially been out of college for a year now with a marketing degree, and I have decided to go back for probably 2-2 1/2 more years for my early childhood education degree. I've realized that I have now gotten off topic somewhat but I would like to take a minute to say thanks to my parents. They have always been supportive of everything I've done and they instilled values in me that I appreciate. Especially compared to the rest of my extended family, I turned out normal. It's nice to be able to go visit family out of town and realize you're the only one without a kid (or two) and you haven't been married twice and divorced twice when you're 23 (or younger in some cases!).

      I must say that I use to make fun of all my friends that would post blogs. However, a former roommate of mine has brought it to my attention that blogging (is that a word?) is actually great therapy. It allows you to vent, rant, and rave about stuff you normally might keep inside. The point of me blogging isn't to impress anyone, make fun of anyone (okay, who are we kidding?), or hurt anyone's feelings (at least I'm going to be honest). The point is for me to a. share my feelings; 2. vent like it's going out of style; and d. let everyone out there that doesn't get to see my lovely face everyday know how I am doing. Did you catch the Home Alone 'reference' in there? I did the little thing that Buzz does to Kevin in the movie. Yes, there will be movie quotes on here from time to time because I'm a dork and I quote movies a lot. Especially Zoolander and Office Space.   In closing, I hope that by me blogging from time to time, I'm making the world a better place. In what way, I'm not really sure. Wishful thinking on my part. Maybe someone from a high-profile publishing company will read my posts one day and think 'hey...this person knows what they're talking about! They should write a book'. In that case, I could become a novelist and cross that off of my "Things to Do Before I Die" list.

      I have slowly become obsessed with the coffee shop that has opened 1/2 mile from my house. It's just a locally owned one that has creme horns to die for and great Caramel Macchiato. I'm also a believer in helping the 'little people' (I use that phrase loosely) so I try and stop there as often as I can. Normally there's a Starbucks on my way, but lately this place has been my favorite.  I've spent the better part of my day going around town looking for items to remodel our hall bathroom with. I'm really excited and I'm hoping my mom will love it. I'm doing it for her and my dad's 33rd anniversary present. It's also something that I know my mom would never take time to do for herself. I'm trying to cater it more to what she would want rather than what I would want because-well-it is their house, not mine. And since they have been nice enough to let me come back and live at home for a time, I don't want to come in here and redecorate everything like I own the place.   I'm glad the weekend is here. I need a break from work. Last week was the end of the month and our sales weren't the best since it's the summer so I had to work my butt off. It paid off though, sales came up some and now I'm enjoying the two days off. I love the weekend...

      The hour that it takes for me to drive to work is a great time for me to just think of many things in my life. Today, I was thinking about the little things in life that we take for granted. I, for one, take many things for granted. For one, yes, it may take an hour for me just to drive to work, but at least I have a vehicle that's in good condition, insurance to cover me if I get in an accident, a JOB, and money to pay for my gasoline each week. There are so many people in the world that have none of this. I've been to Ukraine before and to see how some of their conditions are is so humbling. Americans can be so ungreatful at moments and we are such a disposible country that we barely even stop to think about things. I have had the luxury of having a car since I was 16, something many people don't have. I've never had a new car, but the sheer fact that my mom gave up her car for me when I was 16 so I could drive to and from work was just amazing. She bought a 1985 Oldsmobile for herself and gave me the 'newer' car. Acts like this shouldn't be overlooked in life. Along those same lines, I've got to start being in a better mood around my mom. She does so much for me and has done so much for me in my life. I wouldn't trade her for the world. I think at times she thinks she's been the worst mother in the world. I think her and my dad raised two pretty good kids. I try and remind my mom this a lot in case she has forgotten that she's been a wonderful mother. I wouldn't trade her for another mom;. One of my best friends growing up just lost her mother 2 weeks ago. I cannot even imagine... Life is short sometimes. Why not value what we have today instead of pining after something we don't have and desire? Why be angry at something trivial when it really won't matter tomorrow?

      Me and one of my former roommates went to NYC recently for a vacation. It was so much fun. I love to travel and I got to see a part of the 'world' that I haven't had the opportunity to visit. I was thinking about our trip this morning when I was in the drive-thru line at Dunkin' Donuts for a bagel. The whole bagel thing has really only come to my attention in the past year and a half. That was when I had my first bagel. I am from the south and for breakfast we would eat the good stuff-biscuits and gravy, eggs, toast, etc. One of the things I liked about NYC was when we went to this corner bakery/breakfast store twice and got a bagel with cream cheese. We ate them on the subway (well-really in the subway station-long story). They also had bagels, pastries, hot dogs, and a various array of others edibles on carts along the sidewalk. I really did love the whole atmosphere in NYC. I definitely want to go visit up there again sometime soon. Most people say that it's a place you can visit, but not really a place to live. I think I could actually live up there. Maybe I'm saying that because I've only lived in Georgia, but I like adventure and I liked it when I was up there. Everyone looks different and is dresses different and no one cares. I loved that about New York. I also loved the fact that you can take the Metro almost anywhere and not have to drive! It's such a melting pot for the world, it was just nice to get out of Atlanta. I highly recommend going if any of you haven't been. I will have pictures up soon!

      After much debate within myself, I've decided to give the Blog thing another try. Let it first be known that I think the word Blog itself is dumb. I'm still not sure if I like the whole concept of the 'blog', but whatever. I have so many thoughts in my head during the day I need to write some of them down (or type in this case). Also, if you don't get to see my bright, shining smile (haha) everyday, you can read all about my wonderful life and everything (okay-the few choice things I decide to write about) that's going on in it. This is more for me than for anyone else.   After much thought, prayer, etc. on the matter, I have officially decided to stay in my sales position at work for a while longer. Bottom line-money talks. I also think it's wise to save money like a mad man for at least the next year. I am still going back to school in a few weeks, although I may end up with a Saturday class. I still want to go into teaching (although I have been forwarned by a bizzillion people about how they wouldn't do it all over again, but seriously, who  really  loves their job these days anyways?), but it may just take me a little longer to get this taken care of. I think it's just the wise thing to do to try and save as much money as I can and go to school part time instead of quitting my really good position at work and working part time and going to school full-time. &nbsp;  Everyone asks me how living back at home has been and they say it like someone in my family has died or something. There are some obivous cons to living back at home, but it really hasn't been that bad. I'm just eternally grateful to my parents for being so supportive of me and my decisions that I've made or am making. I still go out a lot and do lots of things, I just don't have people over quite as much as I use to when I lived on my own. Everything happens for a reason, and right now I think I'm where I'm suppose to be. I'm enjoying life, trying to work towards goals that I have, and just having fun.   Don't knock me because I moved back home-I think it was a smart decision!

      the woman who was trying to turn in on a bad angle to the speaker at the Wendy's drive-thru on my lunch. I appreciate you knowing that I went around the building like you should have done to get to the speaker. You let me in front of you while you were trying to back up and get to the speaker and I truly do appreciate the courtesy. If you hadn't done this, I would have rolled my eyes at you.

      that I get excited about. Why shouldn't we get excited about these things? Whether it's getting new glasses (which I got last week and they're awesome) or getting a huge map for my territory at work that I can write on with Vis-a-vis markers, I just enjoy the little things. I'm always getting made fun of at work about this, but hey, it doesn't bother me. I know I'm a dork. Where would I be in life if I only got excited about the 'big' things in life? Probably wearing grumpy pants all the time.   Life is too short to not enjoy everything in it. I relish in the fact that it doesn't take a lot to make me happy. I'm a pretty optomistic person and I like that about myself.   Moral of this blog: Enjoy life, it's the only one you have.

      That is just a classic movie line. I decided that I was going to watch some old movies that I've never seen this weekend (I'm sure the certain someone that let me borrow Spiderman and The Office is going to kill me-oops!). I rented Shop Around the Corner (the movie that You've Got Mail is based on) and A Streetcar Named Desire. Shop Around the corner had Jimmy Stewart in it and it was hilarious. My parents are constantly watching old black and white movies and I've never really had an appreciation of them (well, except for To Kill a Mockingbird-that movie and the book are just great). Streetcar Named Desire had one good thing going for it-Marlon Brando. It also featured Vivien Leigh from Gone With the Wind. It was okay. I wasn't too impressed. Except everytime Marlon Brando came onscreen and took his shirt off. I rented Casablanca last night. I've wanted to see that one for forever. Hopefully, it will live up to its hype.  I'm trying to expand the type of movies that I rent. We rented one last night that we couldn't even get half-way through. I will admit this: I am horrible at picking out a movie if I've never seen it. It's probably happened 5 times where I've rented a movie and it was absolutely horrible. So...moral of that story-don't let me pick out a movie unless you've seen it.

      So I have an abnormal liking for baseball. And I'm female. I've been to probably over 10 games this season and I watch Braves games on t.v. most nights. I also have one of my closest friends that is as big of a nerd about it as I am. She doesn't have cable, so when the games are on Turner South or Fox Sports South, sometimes she comes over and watches them. I know we're dorks. I've loved baseball since I was little. Since the Cubs use to only play day games at Wrigley since they didn't have lights, I would come home from school and turn on the game. I know a lot of people aren't big fans since they think baseball is a slow game. For some reason, I love it. I also like a lot of other sports too though. Growing up playing soccer and always playing games outdoors I just have a weird liking for sports. I don't get totally obsessed like a lot of guys do (well...except for baseball...and I don't think I'd actually use the word obsessed), but I still enjoy watching a lot of them. I'm weird.

      I know that several guys will snicker when they read this but I feel that I need to make this statement. GIRLS don't like it when you keep looking at our boobs when we're trying to have a conversation with you. They don't talk back. Don't look at them. If you feel the need to look at them, do it when we aren't looking or don't notice. I get so annoyed with this. Guys do this to EVERY female, regardless of how small or big a girl's boobs are. They're just boobs. Nothing special. Stop OGGLING!  Not all guys do this, I admit. If they do it, it's discretely. But there are a lot out there and if you're reading this and you do that, STOP!  I just needed to get that off my chest,....no pun intended.

      I just posted a couple pictures in case any of my friends are wondering what color my hair is this month. After pretty much 23 years of being a blonde (minus several attempts at becoming a brunette, redhead, blonde highlights only in the front on medium brown base, etc.) I decided to go short and dark brown in December. Since then....after much thought, opinions, etc....I decided to go back blonde. Slowly. So, for the most part, I'm back blonde again. I think hair color is one way that I can be creative in my life and you're only young once, so why not experiment with it? Looking back on pictures of when I first got my hair cut and dyed (I loved it at the time), I think-1. I look way too much like my mom (T.D. you were right) and 2. What was I thinking? Seriously. I'm growing my hair out by the way for all of you short hair on girls haters. Well...at least that's what my thought is at the moment. I'm always doing something to my hair. It keeps people guessing...

      Dr. Atkins just died. He was fat. Okay, not fat, but overweight many would say. Why would I want to live my life reading the label of everything I put in my mouth to see how many carbs it has? If everyone in America would just move more and eat less (healthier in most cases) then you could lose weight and stay healthy. People are so obsessed with wanting to lose weight the quick way. I don't think people really even understand the long-term effects on diets such as this. Carbs give you energy. I would die without carbs. If Americans weren't so lazy they wouldn't have to be 'counting the carbs'. I get so annoyed when people tell me I shouldn't eat something because it has X amount of carbs....or "you really shouldn't eat that. It has a bizzillion carbs". Um...first of all-I don't care. Second of all, I still don't care and never will care. Fad diets are annoying. The word diet and the whole concept is dumb. I'm female and even I get annoyed with girls when they say how much they constantly want to lose weight, they need to go on a diet, etc. If you freaking get off your lazy butt and exercise and eat less, you should be fine. And who in society said you have to be a certain size anyways?   I know this is one of my first ranting and raving posts but I'm just annoyed. If I see one more commercial for a restaurant that now has a low-carb menu I'm going to scream. They are having to conform to this because so many people are eating this way nowadays. Low carbs, smo carbs is what I say!

      There are times in my life where I would love to move somewhere new, leaving behind the place I've called home for the past 23 years. Georgia is my home and I often wonder if I could live somewhere else. I absolutely love going to visit new places. I finally crossed the Mississippi for the first time last year. I would love to go visit the west coast. Hopefully, with my job, I'll get to go visit this year since my territory is the west coast.  I think often we get comfortable in our surroundings with everything that we know and sometimes we're afraid to take a leap of faith and try something new. I often find there are a lot of things I would love to do and places I would love to go, but it's a matter of finding people to go with you. Sometimes I feel like some people I know are scared to leave the street they live on or the city they live in. Yes, I can do some of this stuff myself, but it's just more fun when you have others to go with you to enjoy the experience.

      I think someone put a big flashing neon light on my car last night while I was sleeping that says "Please pull out in front me. Thank you."

      Mondays are in fact the start of a new work week for most people. The movie Office Space definitely has characters that are in my office. A lot of us want to watch it at a company outing, but I highly doubt that will ever happen. I'm starting school again this month. This will be an exciting time for me. I'm looking forward to it. Since I've decided to stay on full-time for now at work, I will only be taking a couple classes at first. I hope all of this goes well.   I'm also in the midst of trying to work on one project at a time. My mom has the tendency to start a bunch of projects and never finish them and I'm trying not to be like that. At the moment, it's the hall bathroom that I am completely redoing. It's allowing me to be creative and I need a creative outlet right now. My next project is to make a scrapbook for my trip to NYC. I've made scrapbooks for several other people, but never myself. Since I have lots of photos, I figured this is a good time to start one. I'm not really into the whole scrapbooking thing for every little event in your life or going to scrapbooking parties like some people are, but I do want to have some great memories of my trip and I think this is a good way to have them.   Although I am somewhat tired from this weekend, I don't really feel like I have a case of the Mondays. It seems that as I am getting older, the days are passing by quicker. It's strange...

       urlLink    Carnegie Deli. It's famous...and expensive! We ate our last lunch there and we had to split a turkey sandwich. No joke-they literally put 2 pounds of turkey on this sandwich. And you eat elbow to elbow with strangers next to you. Strangely interesting.

       urlLink    The Guggenheim...Frank Lloyd Wright designed this staircase. It was the only part of the museum that you could take pictures in. I wasn't super impressed, but the exhibit they had was pretty cool. It was called "Hands". I personally liked the Met better, but they're two totally different museums...

       urlLink    A view from the top of the Empire State Building. It was actually really foggy and a slight mist was falling when we got up there. Plus the fact that we were a bizzillion feet up in the air...beautiful view of NYC...

       urlLink    The Empire State Building was just a couple blocks from our hotel. We decided to go up to the top at night...well worth it...

       urlLink    Ahhhh...Serendipity. If you've seen the movie, you'd understand why we would want to go. After a second attempt at going, my traveling buddy was a genius when she decided to put our name in (2 hour wait!) and then run down the street and eat lunch. They're frozen hot chocolate (I had peanut butter added) was to die for!

      I've been peeling 3 layers of wallpaper off our bathroom walls last night and today. I, for one, am not a wallpaper person. I think it's the generation before me that loves wallpaper. I hate it. I'd rather paint a room a solid color and then use accents to decorate. What's nice about peeling this wallpaper off the walls is that I am getting a sense of accomplishment out of it. I am by no means trying to complain about peeling wallpaper. I'm just looking forward to the end result and that's making this a lot easier. Plus the cheesy Backstreet Boys and NSYNC that I've been playing so I can just laugh the whole time too. Plus, I can turn the t.v. up as loud as I want since no one else is home so I can listen the braves game and not miss any action.   Does anyone else dislike when you pull up to a stoplight and it goes red and there is no one else around? Then you sit there and the turn light goes green but there's no one in the turning lane and your light is still red? Just wondering. I wish all stoplights were motion sensors.
