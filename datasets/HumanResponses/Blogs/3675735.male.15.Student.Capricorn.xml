      I managed to wake up even though i slept like 3 last night... So i went to school, knowing jolly well that i would be decapitated from the very first period... firstly i did not bring my school badge, next, i did not do my h/w, and, i did not bring my PE attire... Totally Screwed...crap BUT, i did not arrive to school late, did not get punished for improper attire, or yellow forms for late h/w's... Sadly, i had to serve my sentence for being late, way back in March...two hours of detention (sleeping) To summarize today, i feel good~

But when that special someone is not around, you might look around to find them. At that moment, you are in love.   Although there is someone else who always makes you laugh, your eyes and attention might go only to that special someone. Then, you are in love.   Although that special someone was supposed to have called you long back, to let you know of their safe arrival, your phone is quiet. You are desperately waiting for the call! At that moment, you are in love.  If you are much more excited for one short e-mail from that special someone than other many long e-mails, you are in love.   When you find yourself as one who cannot erase all the messages in your answering machine because of one message from thatspecial someone, you are in love.   When you get a couple of free movie tickets, you would not hesitate to think of that special someone. Then, you are in love.

      juz a yr ago... my heart was wide as the ocean, deep as the sea....*crap* many mermaids lived in it... it was calm... peaceful... grab a fish n tt's yur dinner then i became 15...*puberty most likely* the ocean started to toss n turn, gigantic waves... powerful winds... confusion all over... a search for something... .... slowly the water dried up, and there appeared a island there i put 4 seasons... juz to have the beautiful autumn... men lived in it... men like Confidence and Defiance was born... while mermaids like Patience n Order grew old.. then i come into the picture... I search for who I am... __________________________________________________ another master-piece crap...

      Thinking about this for quite some time...    HOME        There's a vast piece of land, covered with fresh green grass... It's not humid, it's not wet... 4 seasons...long autumns and short winters... Somewhere in the middle of it is a road... Along this road are houses... 20? 30? they are all 2nd storey houses... not 1 or 3 they are of the most beautiful design... yet so simple many with picket fence and some with swimming pool under the clear sky with a few patches of clouds and your standing in the middle of the road... looking past the houses... under the lamp light... looking at the city juz a few mlies any... the crystal clear high-rise walls reflecting the sunset... then you hear a bicycle ring... you turn around to see your son cycling towards you... -------------------------------------------------------- Aww crap...
