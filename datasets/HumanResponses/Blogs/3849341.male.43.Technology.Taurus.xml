      What is Faith? Well, if you ask that of an average Christian, the pat answer would be reciting the opening passage of Hebrews the eleventh chapter like a soothing mantra (Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen) for the soul. What concerns me with these pat answers is the lack of depth they reveal relying on a set definition not a living relationship. This type of faith could be akin to a lucky charm that's purpose is to make us feel warm and safe concerning our future. For many believers, their proof of faith is a hazy, almost cloudy, once made profession(Magic words similar to saying hocus pocus during a magic trick) which they wear like a lucky, charm or cling to as a get out of jail free card. This type of faith doesn't seem to have enough "Magic" even to suffice a lone believer, let alone affecting a lost world without "Faith". Another type of faith I have notice is a faith prone to flaunting its power(Magic) like a trophy. In this type of faith, YOU put in YOUR hours, strive hard enough, YOU will attain YOUR trophy, YOUR FAITH. This faith is much more powerful, but seems to be centered on SELF. This type of faith makes the believer the center and the key not only to their faith, but maybe even their own universe(calling things into existence as if they were not). Again, although this faith exudes more power, it does little to reflect accurately the Glory(The beauty of God) to a lost world who is distant from God. In addition, I'm afraid this faith will also leave the individual lacking in true depth in their faith, and spiritually bankrupt. The last type of faith I have come across is one, to use A.W. Tozer's terminology, "The gaze of Soul".. Regretfully this faith is the rarest form to find, and most difficult to obtain. Simply put, faith is our gaze, our view of God. This faith will be weak or strong depending on what diffuses, alters, or hinders ones' view of God. These hindrances, which alter ones reality of God, are plainly put, the sin in our lives. To have a faith that is real, vital, and life changing one must only "fix" ones eyes on the beautiful Son. But the costly part here in lies, as we gaze on the beautiful God, he will reveal the lenses, shades (Sins) which hinder our view of him. This is were we have a choice to grow and strengthen our gaze, or turn back and have our sight (Faith) become dull and void of life. I must confess that I have made both choices in my life, both to strengthen my gaze, and unfortunately turning from God with my gaze becoming dull. The gaze of the soul is a costly thing, best left for only the desperate who have become hollow in their soul, who have determine that faith without a clear view of God is settling for shell of the ultimate beauty which can be found in God.

      Hmmmmmmm, This is a deep can of worms to open up. What do I mean when I ask "Should determining worth Be a Subjective Task?".&nbsp; Well what is the criteria that should be used to determine the worth or value of something.&nbsp; Does the criteria change each time (subjective), or is there a set criteria (an absolute)that should be used. In the natural, common sense would say it is subjective, depending on the people involved, the item, and various other circumstances that could come into play.&nbsp; One example would be, in the middle of a drought, the value of water will increase subjectively because of supply and demand issues.&nbsp;It would seem, at least in dealing, with property that the owner will&nbsp;have the final say in determining the value of the property(Oh BTW I&nbsp;borrowed the&nbsp;owner concept from my friend&nbsp;Professor Karl Golemo) even though there maybe many variables that influence this decision, it is still the owners&nbsp;decision to make.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, can this logic be used across the board to determine the worth or value of everything to include "Human life"? It would seem no matter if you answered YES or NO the reality is&nbsp;in fact people have always use these subjective variables to place a value on Human Life. One titled given&nbsp;this subjective thinking has been called is "utilitarianism". Let me site a few examples to support&nbsp;my statement that this practice of subjectivity, placing value on human life, has existed throughout the ages. You can go back to the early Bedouin societies were females&nbsp;were looked to as a burden when they were born. In societies like these, which&nbsp;by the way still exist in third world&nbsp;countries even today, even India still practices forms of this Utiliarianism,&nbsp;it would not be uncommon for the parents to kill a female baby because they saw the child as a liability, just another mouth to feed. Whereas, a male child was looked upon as being of much greater value because&nbsp;the male child, in the future, would be able to work the fields, hunt, or physical tasks that may not be as easy for females to do.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the biblical history is correct, it was not uncommon for Kings to devalue human life for their own varied purposes. The Pharaoh in Moses time feared the Nation of Israel&nbsp; growing to big and overthrowing his reign. Thus he ordered all first born males to be killed. At the time of the birth of Jesus, The king of that region feared the birth of a supposed Messiah whom he had been told would be born soon. The King, again, ordered that all male child's two years or less to be killed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more recent, but none the less bloody, was the reign of Hitler's Third Reich in the 1930-40's. Instantly, you would think of the mass killing of the Jewish people, and you would be correct. Yet,&nbsp;Hitler started much earlier and much more subtly than how he ended up his campaign. Hitler's political party actually started by devaluing the elderly, the infirmed, and handicapped. In&nbsp;the early thirties Hitler's political party setup boards of doctors, and other officials&nbsp; who were used to help place&nbsp;value on human life that was deemed to be a burden to society. Euthanasia would be too mild of a term to place on the atrocities performed on the weak of society. It wasn't a very far jump to the wholesale slaughter of million of Jews. You see, you must remember it was for the common good of everyone that Hitler killed the weak off,&nbsp; at least that was&nbsp;his subjective criteria to justify killing innocent people.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the same subjective reasoning is use today to justify abortion.&nbsp; The burden the unwanted pregnancy will place on the parents is just to great. There is one unique argument in the subjective arguments concerning abortion. That is that the mother created the child and since the child is part of "Her Body" she has the right, as long as the child is still inside of her to terminate the life.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think my friend is right, it comes down to ownership. Who owns or who created the item or person. If there is a God, and he did create man, then he is the only one who can place a true value on a human life. At this point searching out the world religions to see what value their holy writings&nbsp;show their God Places on Human life would be the next logical step. And this is were I must plead much ignorance. I could not speak intelligently concerning most world religions. But, I would like to express my opinion of what my belief system, Christianity, says concerning&nbsp;what value God places on Human life.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my unlearned understanding of Christianity, I see a God whom&nbsp;from the very beginning placed extreme value on human life and interacting&nbsp;with his creation. In Genesis, it says God made man in his own image. Hmmmm,&nbsp;if you take that statement to be true,&nbsp;it would be difficult to use any subjective reasoning to devalue life. Even more than the fact he made us in his image, is something much more profound. God the father placed so much value on life, that when his creation had been alienated by sin and was out of fellowship with him, he determined to bring&nbsp;his creation back into fellowship through the act of his son becoming a man, just like you&nbsp;and me, and having his son&nbsp;pay the price of sin by allowing him to suffer and die a humiliating death&nbsp;on the cross that we might be able to regain the fellowship that was lost with God. To me, I can't think of anyway to place a higher value on life than to give your own life for that of&nbsp;life you had created. Who is this God that loves us enough that he would die that we might live. I want to know a God that would do that. Not a mean angry God, but a God moved with love for his creation, a God who would stop at nothing to reunite with his creation to himself.

      My very close friend, Reuben Reyes a.k. Ruedog is in Iraq with a private company as a medic. I can not think of anyone I respect more than Reuben. He is both a man of integrity, and a man after God's own heart. It is rare to find both qualities in someone today. This is something that Reuben felt led to do, and I believe God will use him over there to reflect his glory to a people in desperate need of the knowledge of God. If you read this, I would ask you to pray for Reuben that God will fulfill his purposes in his life

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we are getting close to our move to Kansas City. I'm heading up there tomorrow to turn the utilities on at our house we are leasing. My friend Eric is coming along for the ride.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been thinking quite abit about "The Family Unit". What was God's design and purpose&nbsp;for"The Family Unit". What is interesting is how you may know truth, but until it resonates inside of you it just seems like words sometimes, at least it seems that way for me. God truly wants to reflect his Glory through "The Family". In fact, I'm coming to an understanding that "The Church or The Body of Christ" is really just Families interwoven together. If The Church is dysfunctional, look at the families that comprise it. The church can only be as healthy as the Families which together comprise it. A local Church, a smaller part of the whole church, that is dysfunctional, and which is comprised of dysfunctional families is incapable of bringing healing to individuals or families in need. What&nbsp;a dysfunctional church&nbsp;does have to&nbsp;offer instead is backbiting, gossip, disunity, envy etc(Yum,Yum I have tasted some of that nasty rotten fruit)...... We, me, you, anyone, can not expect a local expression of Christ's body to be healthy and life giving when the families are unhealthy. We, "The church", maybe best served in turning inward to God and allowing him to bring the wholeness (Holiness) into our individual lives, our individual Families first before we worry about saving the world. We have so little of God's Glory in our lives and Families that the world, the lost, have no clear view of God's Glory. My friend Karl and I joking talked about this lack that we Christians have. Every time we brush up next to God, and a little bit of his glory rubs off on us, we run around Shouting for everyone to hear" Hey look I have been close to God his glory has rubbed off on me, See, my pinkie is still glowing". It's going to take more than our pinkies glowing to change our lives. We settle for so little of God's Glory in our lives and our families' lives. Start from within let his Glory, his spirit overwhelm our lives, our families lives, and the lost will ask something similar to the&nbsp;Shulamite's friends ask in The Song of Solomon " Where has your beloved gone....Where has he turn aside that we may SEEK HIM with you (SOS 6:1). Sorry for the rant, I was just going to say a couple of thoughts and this all came out. Sue me..... :)

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, as I have previously mentioned, I&nbsp;have named&nbsp;the life lessons that God allows me to experience somersaults. And what increases the difficulty is trying to balance yourself while walking uphill to the mountain of God, my analogy of drawing close to God.&nbsp; The life lessons are needed but painful, enough said.&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't like repeating myself.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life Lesson #2, Well Actually there have been hundreds, but this one is significant one in my life. The lord has taught me this one over and over. I'm just beginning to grasp the lesson's depth. You see I'm a bit dense sometimes, not near as smart and spiritual as some that may read this. #2 Life lesson centers around self-reliance. In the last few years, I have come to the understanding that this presently is one of my biggest weaknesses. The lord, through some of the somersaults, life lessons, has humble me over and over on this subject.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may&nbsp;be splitting hairs on this next thought, but hay its always fun to split a hair or two. When I mention seal-reliance, the normal picture I have is of a proud, arrogant,&nbsp;and self willed individual that thinks he can do anything if he works hard enough, thats not me. My self-reliance is of a different vain, rooted deep in my childhood. Without going into the bloody details, I would just say that I felt fortunate to make it out of adolescence alive and coherent. My brother,&nbsp; Nolan did not make it out at all. To me self-reliance was more of self-survival. I Couldn't rely on my Mom and Dad to keep me safe, or even inpart&nbsp;basic life skills. I came to the conclusion early on&nbsp;in life&nbsp;that if I was going to&nbsp;survive, I was on my own to do so. Granted You must understand, at that time, I had no earthly clue of who God was. I became&nbsp;an expert&nbsp;at survival (self-reliance).  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after I became Christian, my self-reliance was deeply ingrained into me. To show you an example of this self-reliance, I would tell you that from the age of 19 years, other than a stint in the Army, I have always worked for myself. This happen naturally, I couldn't think of putting my future in&nbsp;another person's hands.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, now you see the problem arising. It has been difficult for me to rely on God. Since the time I became a Christian(19 years old), I have always love the lord, and loved to worship him.&nbsp;loving and worshipping God&nbsp;did not immediately mean that I was able to fully rely on God. For years, I didn't even realize how big of a problem it was. As I drew closer to God, The lord would not allow my self-reliance to stand unchecked. He has humbled me over and over on this subject.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This next part is&nbsp;only my opinion so take it as such. I have slowly, and painfully come to the understanding, that God loves it when we are weak and broken, and in need of relying on him. I see it clearly in the word of God that God loves to use weak, broken vessels.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you find yourself caught up in a belief system that is telling you that God loves those who help themselves or any of the self-centered mumbo jumbo, you might do well to reevaluate were you are at and who this God you serve is. God needs nothing from us. He is complete and infinite by himself, and it is because of this that he has such vast mercy, grace, and love for us weak, broken individuals.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I'm coming to a painful but needful understanding. As I press forward to know god in a deeper manner in this journey called life, I feel as if I been heading up hill doing somersaults over and over again. The Journey uphill is my journey to know an infinite god, who is unknowable, and to do this without limit. Somersaults are the painful but needful life lessons that the lord has allowed me to experience in my walk towards him. I have had to many somersaults to list or share them all. I will say that all though usually painful, I have walked (uphill mind you) away a better person, less dysfunctional than before, and more like Christ. You see, unfortunately I didn't start this journey as a spiritual giant(more like a spiritual mouse), but as a teen who barely survived an extremely dysfunctional upbringing.      So, my last Somersault, very recent I might add, was painful but needed. I have always been one to affirm, speak words of life to friends. What I have had difficulty in doing ever is confronting a friend with correction , or setting proper boundaries with people. I have allowed the fear of loosing a friend allow me to keep my mouth shut when I should open it. In the end, it was like a self repeating prophecy over and over again. I kept my mouth shut in fear and in the end I would still either damage or loose a friendship by not speaking up. Not meaning to, I allowed some of my closest relationships to digress to a sometimes spoken truism "familiarity breeds contempt". To speak truth, when needed, set proper boundaries, along with speaking words of life will go a long way to disproving the truism " familiarity breeds contempt". To sum it up in one word, "Balance". But it is a tricky thing to balance yourself as your walking up hill doing somersaults :)

      Well, this is quite new to me. I never have blogged before. I had run across some blogs recently, and thought I would give it a try. My wife, Penni, and I are about to take the biggest risk, leap of faith etc...We have sold are successful business, cheaply I might add, in Tulsa and are moving to Kansas City. We plan on spending a couple of years in KC at The International House of Prayer. For me, this is a huge step (a bit scary)in my life. I have always been the one to worry about working and providing for my family. To walk away from the business I have built over the last eight years was not easy, but I felt it was what we should do. We leased a house in Grandview, MO (with a acre of open space in the backyard, WOW). I felt very clearly last year The Lord speak to me that he was bringing me into a new beginning, and he has. Anyway don't want to ramble to long especially on my first entry. Oh, BTW Oikos means household in greek.

      I had briefly mentioned the term "The Gaze of The Soul" which is a term I use to describe a faith in Christ which is real, alive, and vibrant. This type of faith is not easy to come by, and "is costly to keep. " The Gaze of Soul" will begin to drive you to abandon (self)ish pursuits for the mere opportunity to view "The infinitely Beautiful God" in ways you had not previously. This is were I may get side track for a bit (I apologize in advance for the ramble you are about to experience). We, the church, have gotten so far off track we have lost sight of who we should be gazing at. We have gotten into teaching the doctrines of men, self-help, or three easy steps to a better life sermons. This way of feeding the sheep is easy, anyone can do it (and I do mean anyone). Instead of imparting manna from heaven, we give the sheep our home made recipes. These home made(self made) recipes can contain various ingredients to make it smell, and taste good. Yes, it may taste good going down, but it has no nutritional value leaving us empty, shallow, hungry, and void of the life we so desperately need. Who's to blame for this mess?? Hmmmmm. Well, each of us will stand accountable before this "infinitely Beautiful God" one day. We each will have to give account of how far we missed the a mark. But, there are some that will be held to a higher account, these are the shepherds, the Pastors. Ooops, now were treading on thin ice here, going step on a few toes for sure(I told you that this was going to be a ramble). One thing, I think about quite often is how Christ interacted with the people he came in contact with. More specifically, who were the people Jesus actually showed anger towards? Now, I'm not talking about Jesus rebuking, instructing the disciples when they messed up, that was Christ showing the love of a concerned father correcting his children. I'm talking about the spiritual leaders (pharasees) of the day. Jesus openly showed his anger towards the religious leaders of the day. Why?( look past the surface there may be a lesson in here somewhere).They were Hippocrites!!! Yes that is true, they were Hippocrites, teaching one thing and doing another. But, I believe there is still a deeper reason why Christ was angry at the religious leaders of the day. Still thinking?? Well, the leaders were suppose to be teaching and pointing the way to "The Father". They had cease to point the way to "The Father", and now just gather people unto themselves. I truly believe that Christ burned with anger because the religious leaders had so blocked the people's (sheep's) view of God, that people could no longer find there way to "The Father". Jesus burned with jealously over his children that were being kept from him. My point of this whole ramble is to say, that I believe for the most part shepherds today no longer point the way to the father, and are more worried about drawing men unto themselves. Shepherds should primarily focus on the #1 and #2 of it. What is the #1 and the #2 of it? #1 is to teach continuously without reservation on "The Knowledge of Who God is". God is infinate so there should be no lack of material, but you do have to go mining for it, dig deep for it. What is #2? One point first! #2 can only be taught effectively after #1 has began to take root. You can not teach #2 first. #2 is how God truly views them, not how they view themselves, or how the world views them. #1 and the #2 are crutial to "The Gaze of Soul". If your sight is impaired, having trouble Gazing on God, then focus (Gaze) on the #1 and #2 of it, give it a try, it can't hurt, at least I hope it can't:)

      In Christianity today, with all of our mega-churches to show our stupendous growth(Tozer calls this type of growth losses spread over a wider area), we seemed to be lacking something of great importance. Our lack is not a need for anymore slick marketing, self help mumbo-jumbo, or catching the newest fad trumpeted by the latest best selling book. What is it that we lack? Let me apologize for taking a moment to build a case that in fact we are lacking. I always quote this one line from the 12 step recovery program. I consider it a truism and you can apply it concerning most topics. The truism is "the first step to getting help is admitting you have problem". That's not what the church lacks, but it is a precursor to getting the help we need. If we don't realize how utterly shallow, bankrupt, and void of life our faith has become, then we are not yet at a point were we can get help. I have found myself at this point of bankruptcy more than once, I'm sorry to admit. Maybe its just me!? Maybe I'm the anomaly, the exception to the rule, and Christianity is in its finest hour, its glory days. But I would pose one are two probing questions to test the present state of Christianity. Is our lives, internally, and spiritually, at a point were our internal lives spill out freely, overflowing to the people around us. Is there something tangibly different about us that both convicts and draws "THE LOST" at the same time without aid of our PROPS. Hmmmmmm, tell me true. I know I'm found lacking. What about you?What about the church?Maybe its just me, maybe I'm the only one lacking!? Well, onto the solution, what is it we lack? We could list many things, but they are secondary, not foundational. The solution can be known by several names. The Moravians, led by Count Zinzendorf, called it simplicity of devotion to Christ. I steal a term from Song of Solomon, used by Mike Bickle quite often. Lovesickess. We must cultivate a deep sustaining lovesickness for Christ. We settle in scraping the surface in the knowledge of who Christ truly is. There must be more than what we have been mining. In heaven, the Elders and Angels fall prostrate everytime they look a new at this infinitely beautiful God. If we begin to search the depths of Christ, will he let us come up empty? No, I don't believe he will let us stay bankrupt. But we have to give up pursuing the vain, useless things we have given our hearts to(ouch that hurts). In this process of searching the depths of Christ, God will awaken a "LOVESICKNESS" in our hearts. A warning though!! Straight from Song of Solomon 2:7 "Do not stir up nor awaken love until it pleases". Once lovesickness is awaken, you will be ruined, of no earthly good. ;)
