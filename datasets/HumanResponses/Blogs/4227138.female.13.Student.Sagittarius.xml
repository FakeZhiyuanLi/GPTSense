       School was boring as usual. Then came the fun part! It was 5:00 as we set off on the road to Corydon, Indiana. The bad thing was... we didn't eat beforehand. Jill gets hyper when she doesn't eat. The way there consisted of Jill singing, saying "Arbys Arbys Arbys Arbys...etc" (we were meeting Sarah and Melanie there to eat) and "Dodo, lobster, tucan!!" over and over and over again. That was nightmaric.    When we got there we ate, signed Nick's belated birthday card and talked about how excited we were. After eating my friends deserted me and went in the car with my mom leaving me alone with my dad. (I like driving places with my dad, I just felt... left out)   At the church we discovered that Slingshot 57 wasn't back from eating yet. So we waited, giggled and Melanie hyperventilated while giggling. Once they got there it was fun. We saw Ben first, then Paul... this was fun for Melanie. She  had  to get a picture. Two in fact. The first one he knew about, the second surprised him. We giggled everytime someone said something or someone took a picture... we were absolutely insane. Here we are before the concert and before we saw any of the guys.      At first everytime Nash walked by Sarah kept saying "There goes your future husband!" And Jill got on my nerves with stuff like that too. I'm too shy to do anything special right now. Once I get used to seeing them more often, the more open I'll be to showing my... better side. Oh well. It might be better at the next concert.    Exciting news for me. My youth minister is working on getting Slingshot 57 to play at our church! Woo-hoo! If they play at our church... I'll definitely feel way more comfortable. Now, back to the story   The concert was wonderful. So much fun. Afterwards we were surprised at how many people didn't really hang around them... It was kind of like we were stalkers because we followed them around. We got wonderful pictures. We're all going to be sharing with each other. Definitely. Melanie got "butt pictures" after the show was over and they were loading up stuff. That was so funny. We don't think they even noticed!    Silly string is a wonderful thing. We silly stringed the van and wrote on the trailer. Melanie was the first to do damage to the van. She had the black can of silly string. It came out white at first, though. (thank goodness) She got the it all over the windshield. We were all giggling like crazy and they didn't even seem to care then either! They were right behind it at the trailer!!! Then once it got near the end of them packing, Sarah silly stringed Nash with the pink silly string. "Pink is a very masculine color." As Melanie stated.    The night came to a close with them coming out for the last time to see the damage we had done and for us to say goodbye to them. (Melanie and Kari went in to get them) They all started to get in and thought they were going to leave until they finally noticed the silly string on the windshield. Neill got out to get it off. (made me feel kinda bad even though I didn't spray it on there) And as they closed the doors and we all said goodbye we waved and Melanie once again silly stringed the van...    That night had many memories even after they left.. but, I'm too lazy to put them on here. That took long enough in itself. I might feel like writing about the after events later today though.

        Here's what the title means....   Spelldown is a game that we play in spelling.. I hate it. I hate games that help me to learn. I like to learn, then play games that have nothing to do with learning.     Straighten up is the fact that that's what my class needs to do. (according to Mrs. Nelson) We talk too much in line, we're bad at lunch, we talk too much in class. Whatever. It's only the fourth day lady, get over it.    Ah the power of purple. Let's see. Our PE teacher is kinda cute, but evil. He's evil because we have to do drills on Tuesdays. Our drills consist of 36 exercises.. ooooh my. The only time it seems he may not be evil, is on Thursdays. Thursdays we play a game, such as dodgeball, soccer, football (aaah!! I'll probably get trampled..) and basketball, whatever.    Jill can't believe that we're already here in eighth grade and that we've learned so much. Actually, I can't either. It's quite amazing.    ¤~Never under estimate my Jesus~¤

       Ok.. that has nothing to do with this "post" but.. whatever. My third day of school was interesting. It was ok. Chapel was boring. I can't wait for Friday because that will be my break. I have a feeling that as I climb the ladder of high school, I'll need more "breaks" .. no wonder the high schoolers get to have more fun during school. I'm considering going to the Switchfoot concert coming up. It's free, so, that gives me reason.    My hair has blown me away today. It's so.. blech. Frizz control is what I need people. How come frizzy brown hair is so common? Why not blonde frizzy hair? Or black? ..    I have to clean.. I hate cleaning. I have to fix up my room.. ooh, torture. I guess now would be better than later because I have to wait for Sarah to get on anyways..

         Someone  ....   hasn't emailed me yet. Sarah.. you know who it is. This time.. don't send an PM.. cuz, that was.. weird.  The second day of school. I forgot my watch yet again. I'll need that tomorrow I guess. She always alerts us when we switch so that's not really confusing. I thought it would be confusing and stuff. So far, school seems ok. I'm only scared of    PE.    Since we have a male PE teacher this year..I'm scared. We've only had females. And they're nicer in PE, at least, that's what I'm assuming.      Think Pink. I don't usually like pink.. but, it's ok now..  Ever had a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach? ... So have I. That had nothing to do with.. anything on here.     Stand back people! I'll put the  FIRE   out!!!   *Wooosh*   And the   flames   stop...

       Forever.   Seriously. It won't be much fun once we get into the "full day" thing. It was somewhat fun today because we have Josh Burke, Chris Bowman, Matt P. and Nate Toby (yep.. heir to the Toby Tours, I ain't kidding..) in our class... they make everything goofy. I just might have fun this year. I think we still have the 8th grade banquet.. yay! My first form of a "dance" or "formal" I guess. I've never heard much about it, I'm just excited because our school doesnt allow dances. (except for the 11th and 12th grade banquet.. which is a prom sorta thing)    I need to go now.. mother needs the phone.. I shall update in a while, though.

        Well, that certainly describes me right now... I need    fun   .   Family is coming over.. they should be here any minute. We'll have my grandma, my Aunt Carol, Uncle Marty, Aunt Brenda, Reese and Julie over.. headache waiting to happen..     Nancy Drew.... I want the new cd. Secret of Shadow Ranch. They can't make up their minds, can they... It's out, it's shipping.. people already have it!   How Come I Can't Find It?!    Ok.. I'll calm down now. I just really want it... and I'm really confused as to whether it's out or not...   I think I need to get off here... and.. get my fingers warm. brr.

       Well, that's what it feels like I should be doing. I found out that other members of my family are sick too. But with different stuff than what I have.    Another picture!     Pretty    Paul.

      That's where I would've been going today if I wasn't sick. I feel much better now, for some reason. I slid down the steps for a while and bounced on my bed. I felt energetic for a few moments and that was weird. I decided I want to post a picture...   I was the only one out of our group of five (although only four people had cameras) who got this picture...now I have to make copies of it for everybody.
