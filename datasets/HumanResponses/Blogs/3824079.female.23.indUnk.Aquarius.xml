         Gore is one thing, but violence to women is another when it's overdone. Takashi Miike should've laid off!

         I'm looking for Vash the Stampede? Rumoured to be the Human Typhoon that can destroy a city in one night. I hear he wears a red coat and has blonde hair aka broom head. He's not really a villian, especially when he's all about LOVE & PEACE!

         This is the only one I have of his works. I love Will Rafuse's adaptation of people in the service business. I think it's the colors he use that touches me most. I feel vibrant and alive when I look at them.

         I get a feeling of nostalgia everytime I see Astroboy.  He was my hero in a plastic body with super gel hair. I think it's frightening that I don't really remember much about my childhood (nothing vivid) except my favourite tv shows.

         This is so far the prettiest lady I've found in vintage shanghai posters. I think however that she's a calendar girl rather than an ad.

It's cleaner now, but Shanghai looks the same, it sounds the same, and it smells the same."  - Ralph Hirsch, escaped from Berlin to Shanghai as a boy in 1940, had a tiny apartment for six months, then lived in one small room for six years.   i feel nostalgic...

         Interesting phenomenon. However, the Bible's use of 'hands' and 'feet' included everthing from the actual hand to wrist and feet to ankles, respectively. Catholics have  assumed  that Christ was pierced in the hands and feet but Jesus could've just as well have been pierced in the wrists and ankles.
