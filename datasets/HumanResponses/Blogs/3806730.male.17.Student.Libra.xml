      It's a rainy, windy day today... 'wanted to sleep all day.  Had three classes only, and I was dismissed early from laboratory coz the lights were out so we couldn't program in our computers.  I am feeling much, much better, by the way :)  In a few minutes, I'm off to PE practice, we have a practical exam tomorrow.  My PE this sem's ballroom dancing.. man, nahiya naman ako.  I wanted to cancel it on the day of enrollment, but it required such a tedious process (exag) so I decided I'll bear with it for the rest of the sem anyway. Sayang naman daw, binigay na sakin yung PE.  It isn't so bad after all.. since I enjoy dancing anyway.  We're doing American waltz right now, so things are still going fine.

      'had a great morning.. there really is no better way for me to spend Sunday mornings than at church for the weekly service.  The Word was about Jesus, being the light of the world.. and how his being the light means.. basically the pastor gave us 3 points - the Benefits of Light. (1) Light conquers darkness.  There really is nothing to fear because we are sure that anything and everything that comes our way is already overcome.. In the end, it'll still be light that's gonna reign over darkness.  (2)  Light gives direction.  We know where to go and how to do stuff because JC leads us and shows us how.  He enlightens us - not to force us to do something or go somewhere - but guides us lovingly as a Father and friend.  (3) Light exposes what is unseen.  This isn't supposed to be negative.. We sometimes don't see what's wrong with us until somebody has the guts to tell us, or if we learn it the hard way.. well light kind of does this.. like looking at a huge mirror with light bulbs all around it.  We wouldn't miss a pimple, scar, discolored patch of skin, blackhead, whitehead or whatever that may be. God doesn't want us to remain the same.. He wants us to reach higher heights, and be more like His Son JC.  I'm just waiting for my roommates to get back.. then we'll probably study til 11pm.  My Monday and Wednesday skeds aren't that full, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  Tuesdays and Thursdays however are serious matters.. it's such a relief I don't have class on Fridays.

       If two people love each other, but just can't seem to put things together, when would that point be.. when one would say enough is enough? NEVER.  ---THE MEXICAN      If you love someone you say it...you say it right then, out loud...or the moment just...passes you by.  ---MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING      "It's funny how we set qualifications for the right person to love while at the back of our minds we know that the person we trully love will always be an exception"  ---Ally McBeal --     I feel like the best version of myself when i'm with you... and that makes me doubt everything else.  ---KEEPING THE FAITH      I would rather have had  One breath of her hair,  One kiss from her mouth,  One touch of her hand,  Than an eternity without it...  ---CITY OF ANGELS    "Sometimes when you hold out for everything, you walk  away with nothing."  ---Ally McBeal    Fate exists but it can only take you so far, Because  once you're there, It's up to you to make it happen.  ---CAN'T HARDLY WAIT    You will see a lot of things,  But they will mean nothing to you  If you lose sight of the one you love.  ---AT FIRST SIGHT    "If two people are meant for each other, it doesnt mean that they are meant for each other NOW."  ---pacey, "DAWSON'S CREEK"    I guarantee it won't be easy. I guarantee that at one point or another one of us is going to want to leave. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine I am going to regret it for the rest of my life because I know in my heart you are the only one for me.  ---RUNAWAY BRIDE    Dear Catherine,  I'm sorry I haven't talked to you in so long. I feel I've been lost. No bearings, no compass. I kept crashing into things, a little crazy I guess. I've never been lost before. You were my true north. I could always steer for home when you were my home. Forgive me for being so angry when you left. I still think some mistake's been made and I'm waiting for God to take it back. But I'm doing better now. The work helps me. Most of all, you help me.   You came into my dream last night with that smile of yours that always held me like a lover, rocked me like a child. All I remember from the dream is a feeling of peace. I woke up with that feeling and tried to keep it alive as long as I could.   I'm writing to tell you that I'm on a journey toward that peace. And to tell you I'm sorry about so many things. I'm sorry I didn't take better care of you so that you never spent one minute being cold or scared or sick. I'm sorry I didn't try harder to find the words to tell you what I was feeling. I'm sorry I never fixed the screen door. I fixed it now. I'm sorry I ever fought with you. I'm sorry I didn't apologize more. I was too proud. I'm sorry I didn't bring you more compliments on everything you wore and every way you fixed your hair. I'm sorry I didn't hold on to you with so much strength that even God couldn't pull you away.   All my love. G.  ---MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE    "I love that you get cold when its 71 degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich. I love that you get a little crinkle in your nose when you're looking at me like i'm nuts. I love that after i spend a day with you, i can still smell your perfume on my clothes. and i love that you are the last person i want to talk to before i go to sleep at night. and it's not because i'm lonely, and it's not because it's new Year's eve. i came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."  ---WHEN HARRY MET SALLY    You cannot find true love where it does not truly exist. And you cannot hide it where it truly does.  ---KISSING A FOOL    "Me? I'm scared of everything. I'm scared of what I saw, of what I did, of who I am. And most of all, I'm scared of walking out of this room and never feeling the rest of my whole life the way I feel when I'm with you."  ---DIRTY DANCING

      I hate the way you talk to me And the way you cut your hair I hate the way you drive my car I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots And the way you read my mind I hate you so much it makes me sick It even makes me rhyme. I hate the way you're always right I hate it when you lie I hate it when you make me laugh Even worse when you make me cry I hate it that you're not around And the fact that you didn't call But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you Not even close, not even a little bit,  not even any at all. - Kat, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU   "When you kiss someone, everything around you becomes hazy... and the only thing in focus is you and this person... And you realize that this person is the only person you should be kissing for the rest of your life... And for one moment, you get, this amazing gift... And you wanna laugh and you wanna cry... Cuz you feel so lucky that you've found it and so scared that it'll go away all at the same time..."  ---NEVER BEEN KISSED    Is it possible to be just friends with someone i have these sort of non-moderate feelings for?... Or am I doomed forever to just be in love and ultimately significantly hurt?  ---Felicity    I created my very own first breakup rule: Destroy all pictures where he looks sexy and you look happy. Breakup rule No. 2: Until emotionally stabilized, enter no stores. Breakup rule No. 3: Never stop thinking about him, even for a moment. Because that's the moment he'll appear. And finally, the most important breakup rule: No matter who broke your heart or how long it takes to heal, you'll never get through it without your friends.  ---Carrie, SEX AND THE CITY    The only wrong thing would be to deny what your heart truly feels. ---THE MASK OF ZORRO    You will be doing anything  For the one you love...  Except love them again.  ---FAITHFUL    Lois: You know, if somebody had asked me three days ago who the one person in the world I admired most was, I'd have said you. But, without really knowing what that meant. Without understanding that the hardest thing about being you is all the things you can't do. All the cries for help that you can't answer, and how that quietly tears you apart. But it never stops you. And after living a little of that myself, I realized something...something I never thought was possible.   Clark: What?   Lois: I love you more. More than I ever have and more than I ever thought I could love anyone, and so, I wanna ask ... Will you marry me?  ---LOIS AND CLARK    I know it's a cornball thing, but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? I say fall head over heels. Find someone you love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your heart... Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back. Because the truth is, there is no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived... Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike.  ---MEET JOE BLACK    Man: "Will you love me for the rest of my life?"  Woman: "I will love you for the rest of mine."  ---PHENOMENON    "The only feeling of real loss is when you love someone, more than you love yourself."  ---GOOD WILL HUNTING    When you love someone, And you love them with your heart, It never disappears when you're apart. When you love someone And you've done all you can do, You set them free. And if that love was true, When you love someone It will all come back to you  ---FORGET PARIS    "Half my days i cannot bear not to touch you, the rest of the time i feel it doesn't matter if i ever see you again. It isn't the mortality, it is how much you can bear..."  ---THE ENGLISH PATIENT    Do you believe in love? I bet you don't, you're probably too sensible for that. Have you ever seen someone and you know that if only that person really know you, they'd dump the perfect model they were with and realize that you are the one they want to grow old with? Have you ever fallen in love with someone you've never talked to? Have you ever been so alone you spent the night confusing a guy in a coma?  ---WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING    "anything less than mad, passionate, extraordinary love is a waste of your time. there are too many mediocre things in life to deal with and love shouldn't be one of them."  ---A DREAM FOR AN INSOMNIAC     "how can you assume to be friends with someone when all you think about when you look at him is how much more you really want?"  ---joey, DAWSON'S CREEK    Don't you understand? That everything I do, I do for you? Anything that might be special in me...is you.  ---GREAT EXPECTATIONS    One day, you look at the person and see more than you did the day before, like a switch was flickered somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is suddenly the only person you can imagine yourself with.  ---Xfiles (series)    "There are some people who meet that somebody that they can never stop loving, no matter how hard they try. I wouldn't expect you to understand that, or even believe it, but trust me, there are some love that don't go away. And maybe that makes them crazy, but we should all be lucky to end up with that somebody who has a little of that insanity. Somebody who never lets go. Somebody who cherishes you forever."  --- Ally Mc Beal

      It's gonna be a long weekend again.. but thankfully, I have one roommate left with me, and it's just the two of us left at the dorm.  The other 22 have gone home for the weekend.  But the weekend is one welcoming thought, especially that I need to catch up on the things I missed in 5 classes yesterday.  Dinner for two, was for Richel and me, and it's practically gonna be just the two of us for the next two days.  We had dinner at this grill that played sentimental music.. and man, we couldn't help it.. looking out the window, thinking sad thoughts, and missing home and whoever it was on our minds. yeah right :)  Anyway, we ended up talking about movies that had us ooohh-ing and awhhh-ing.  Like Serendipity, Kate & Leopold, Never Been Kissed, Ten Things I Hate About You, Notting Hill, City of Angels, Sweet November.. and the like.  So forgive us ok? Couldn't help it.. we had a great time anyway, still ooohhh-ing and awhhhh-ing over the scenes we talked about.  I'm feeling a little better, though still not that okay.  I'm waiting 'till Sunday, and if all doesn't go well, I'm going back to the doctor.. I'm hopeful though, I know the next week will be great.

      I went to the doctor yesterday.. I had been having terrible stomach aches and diarrhea since Monday night.. hhh.. imagine that.  I thought it was "normal", and that I'd eventually get rid of it all, whatever it was I ate. But yesterday it just got worse..I was reeling from the pain, and it hurt real bad, especially on afternoons, though I have no idea why. And then at 4pm yesterday, I had a fever, 38.5 C.  And so I had no choice but to go to the doctor and have myself checked.  Fortunately I had my roommate with me.  The doctor said I had infectious diarrhea and showed signs of dehydration already.  He would have been pleased if I had myself admitted in the hospital, but I told him that "kaya ko pa naman".  Then my roommate and I went ahead and bought the medication I needed.  I still had the fever until this morning.  I was having those terrible stomach aches at noon again so I slept for two hours.  At 4pm, I was feeling much better.  Hopefully this'll all be gone tomorrow.  I don't have class on Fridays, but it's really unfortunate that I missed 5 classes and 1 quiz today.  Still, GRACE overflowed for me, and instead of 3 quizzes, only 1 quiz was given today so I practically missed just one. haaaay.. thank you Lord!  My temperature's back to normal, and I'm feeling okay.  Tomorrow.. things will be even better.

      I was at church earlier this evening and did I have a nice surprise.. we all had this activity (a "convergence" of some cell groups) and I was even supposed to sing Lisa Loeb's Stay. However the guitarist wasn't able to come, so I ended up singing Someday We'll Know with a friend and another guitarist. It was all so "kengkoy" (silly/funny) because we had the lyrics mixed up.. nevertheless, everyone started to sing along so it ended up okay. Then we had the Word, a 15-minute group discussion and then we just talked with each other.  And then..... as I was talking to some friends I heard everybody singing "Happy Birthday" to my back.. I looked back at all of them, at the cake and flowers they were holding, and looked around at who could they be singing at so I could sing along too.. and a friend said, "IKAW, Loms.. Happy Birthday!" And I was like.. it's NOT MY BIRTHDAY!  As it turns out, my cell mates (kasama ko sa cell group) just really wanted to surprise me.. and make it up because it was on April 1 and they didn't get to surprise me really because I was home for the summer.. and so there I was, saying thank you to everyone greeting me.. belated daw syempre.. nevertheless, I was really surprised, and it was really sweet of them. haaaaaayy...

      Okay, so this is the first time I'm posting here. It's been one lonely, lazy weekend for me, but I have a feeling it's also gonna be my first and last lazy one here in LB. In the weeks to come, I'm pretty sure the things I need to do are gonna be up to my neck. (okay, exag konte) But anyway, not doing anything is not so fun either, put up against doing a whole lot. Nakakabato na dun sa dorm, so here I am, doing something "worthwhile".    I went to church yesterday morning, and we all had lunch together after the worship service.  Then I got back to the dorm around 3pm.  I took a quick shower, and proceeded right to what I really like doing when there's nothing else left to do - reading.  My roommate (who went home to Pampanga for the weekend) left a book she's been reading for the week - Danielle Steel's Kaleidoscope. And man, my sister is right, her books are depressing.  Nevertheless, I revelled reading them when I was in high school, and now that I'm at it again, Kaleidoscope isn't that bad either.  It was so depressing reading it at first, especially that I was listening to sad songs on my player.  Eventually, the story got more interesting and exciting, and "I couldn't put the book down" as some or almost everyone would like to say when describing a book they liked. I was reading from 5pm till 1am, and come to think of it, I didn't even have dinner.  I stopped reading after I finished three-fourths of the book.  I just finished all 395 pages of it this morning.  And I was like some fool, alone in our room, crying.. the story was so touching.. and I'm glad it had a "happy ending".. I practically cried with the characters.. I could almost feel their pain and afterwards, the relief.  (whoosh, drama!)  Really, it was all so dramatic.  Good thing all my roommates were out.  After reading I took a shower again, reviewed a little Math, wrote some notes on my journal about some things I read from my Bible.  Then I started to write in my "List Notebook".. it's where I list the things I want to do, places I want to go to, food/cuisines I want to try out, and a bulleted list of how I want some events in the future to be like. It's like a compiled list of the stuff I should be able to do as long as I'm alive.  And then I got tired of it all and went to this shop right beside my dorm to do this..check my mail and wait for some people online to chat with.  I'm both anxious and excited for this week, 'cause it's gonna be more real and well, more "nakaka-pressure".  Last week was spent basically getting to know our professors, and listing down the things we needed for each class.  This week is gonna be the real start..a lot of "unexpecteds" is gonna strike me mad, and man, I wanna go home just thinking about it.  I'd rather be in high school.  But this is my life now, and there's nothing I can do 'xcept handle everything with all the grace I can muster.  bshuks!

      hey, college isn't really like drilling a hole on your temple, LJ... well sometimes, I guess. But that's just really how life is.&nbsp;Anyway, there are some great things about being in college, but I'll talk about that next time. &nbsp; I'm off to the library in a while, 'have to do an assignment in&nbsp;English 1.. very basic, but the technicalities will make you go crazy.. you have to watch every word you use, and make sure it's in the proper category.. ok ok. &nbsp; I'm just glad another week is over, and that's ANOTHER WEEK CLOSER TO GOING BACK HOME!!!&nbsp; I just have one exam next week, a CMSC major. &nbsp; All my roommates are staying for the weekend, since they have a lot of exams next week. This is gonna be a quick weekend. &nbsp;

      whew! My day is finally over.. I've been so mentally harassed today! 'had a full sked, 8am to 5:30pm with only an 11-11:30am break, and I just had a burger to eat.  And all my teachers, sinagadsagad ang oras!!  Up to the last minute, they were overloading us students with terms, definitions, formulas, and problems.. by afternoon, I was not in the mood for critical thinking anymore.  My last subject, Math 27, was 4-5:30.. and man.. derivatives and integrals were ringing in my ears.. and my teacher's  "You can't do that.. it doesn't work that way.."  "Here's the trick.. now try this.."  every now and then really ticked me off. Usually, him saying that would amuse me.. but I was just so tired!  I tried my  best to literally keep my eyes open, listen and watch him do the mathematical wonder on the board, and copy everything I needed to copy.  I was like "tama na, sir!"  And instead of letting us go thirty minutes early, he kept us in class up to the last minute.  Eventually, I got back to the dorm still alive (tsk, exag) and up for my last appointment for the day - cell meeting.  I so wanted to sleep.  At least, my roommate Sheilla went with me and we had an okay time.  One thing Ate Laida, a cell leader said, was that life is like a basketball game.. and those times with God and with his people are like time outs.. time to huddle and encourage, teach, and help each other.   LJ!!! Can I post in your xanga now?  'Haven't read the link you posted yet. hihi:)

      i just completely lost track of everything yesterday. i don't know why! well it has been such an interesting week.. with the absence of something and then the presence of something else. confusing. i don't want to make a mistake by pushing that away. maybe i already forfeited my chance. confusing. anywaaay. loma you make college sound like a power drill through the temple (i remember that from x2). now i have something really good to look forward to. just messing. um, i have to register for classes online this friday. wish me luck that people won't hog my precious, needed classes and have nothing left to sign up for. of course you can post in my xanga anytime. anytime you like. i hope everything is going a little smoother now? still the constant barrage of information? well anyway a neighbor is blaring some good music.. i'm gonna go listen. bye!

      poetry, poesía.. loms, if you like pablo neruda's poems, you're gonna like josé martí's too. in my spanish classes they've been featured a few times and compared with the english translations, i think the original spanish is much more interesting. as they say.. things are lost in translation.    Versos Sencillos  por José Martí          Yo soy un hombre sincero       de donde crece la palma,       y antes de morirme quiero       echar mis versos del alma.  	Yo vengo de todas partes,       y hacia todas partes voy:       arte soy entre las artes,       en los montes, monte soy.  	Yo sé los nombres extraños       de las yerbas y las flores,       y de mortales engaños,       y de sublimes dolores.  	Yo he visto en la noche oscura       llover sobre mi cabeza       los rayos de lumbre pura       de la divina belleza.  	Alas nacer vi en los hombros       de las mujeres hermosas:       y salir de los escombros       volando las mariposas.  	He visto vivir a un hombre       con el puñal al costado,       sin decir jamás el nombre       de aquella que lo ha matado.   that's part of it! for more, go to: http://poesia-infantil.com/cuba/marti.html#c_link  if you don't get it, then just read it. it still sounds nice even though it won't make any sense. hehe. i hope the weekend was good for you! take care!

      Finally the weekend has come, and I almost don't want it to end.. I still have tomorrow to take my time anyway.  It's me and Richelle again for the weekend.. but she has two roommates who are freshies who've stayed for the weekend too.   I have a couple of quizzes next week, but no exams.. buti na lang!!  I've recovered, somehow, from my not so good week.  Hopefully, babawi this week and it'll be a great one.  Well, great or not so good, I know things WILL be alright, and eventually I'll end up great.  Here's another one.. a poem that my roommate Sheilla took up in Lit. class last sem.. it interests me 'cause while reading it, I can almost feel the writer's misery.. so poignant..     TONIGHT I CAN WRITE    Tonight I can write the saddest lines.  Write, for example, 'The night is starry and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance.'  The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.  Tonight I can write the saddest lines. I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.  Through nights like this one I held her in my arms. I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.  She loved me, sometimes I loved her too. How could one not have loved her great still eyes.  Tonight I can write the saddest lines. To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.  To hear the immense night, still more immense without her. And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.  What does it matter that my love could not keep her. The night is starry and she is not with me.  This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance. My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.  My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer. My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.  The same night whitening the same trees. We, of that time, are no longer the same.  I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her. My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.  Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses. Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.  I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her. Love is so short, forgetting is so long.  Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.  Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer and these the last verses that I write for her.   Pablo Neruda

      It seems as if the bad start I had two days ago has a great effect on my week.. wednesday pa lang and I'm already so exhausted!!! I just had 3 subjects today, but it feels like I had 6.  I am sooooo looking forward to Friday.. better days and better weeks and better times are ahead.  So I better look to that.  Listening to Jars of Clay and Josh Groban last night, they kinda lifted my spirits..     I'm here waiting for something new to break my heart So callous laden, I can't feel a thing at all Will You catch my fall?  From lost and not found, to run and not hide My hand inside... (Your hand)  Fear is keeping time with the beating of my heart Doin' way too much thinkin' And it's tearing me apart But I, I feel You reach for me  From lost and not found, to run and not hide My hand inside... (Your hand) Losing my grip falling so far My hand inside Your hand  I hear Your voice and follow So hard to believe, and still I go.                    Jars of Clay

      i was gonna blabber in ilonggo but since this is all english, then english it is. loma, i LOVED spiderman 2. thanks for recommending it. i watched it yesterday and i loved loved loved it. i think it was the first time that i actually really felt for the character.. such pity and compassion i felt for peter parker. tobey played him well. and as my previous comment to kirsten dunst's acting, she did a good job. and the most hilarious part was the asian lady plucking her violin and singing a bad version of "spiderman." anyway it's back to spanish 1 again tonight. bla bla bla. i had four days off of summer class but i guess now i'm ok. hey don't forget to check out my xanga: http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=elejotalaws

      It wasn't such a good day for me today.. hay, basta.. not so good things happened lang.. hehe.. but at least I got my lab exercise in Statistics 1 right, and it wasn't such a dreadful 3-hour lab period.  Anyway, here's another song na lang.. originally Bob Marley's, done again by Annie Lennox, and featured in the movie Serendipity's soundtrack.  The movie was okay, and the soundtrack's good too, by the way.    I don't wanna wait in vain for your love I don't wanna wait in vain for your love. From the very first time I rest my eyes on you, girl, My heart says follow t'rough. But I know, now, that I'm way down on your line, But the waitin' feel is fine:  So don't treat me like a puppet on a string, 'Cause I know I have to do my thing. Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb; I wanna know when you're gonna come - soon.  I don't wanna wait in vain for your love I don't wanna wait in vain for your love I don't wanna wait in vain for your love,  'Cause if summer is here, I'm still waiting there; Winter is here, And I'm still waiting there.  Like I said:  It's been three years since I'm knockin' on your door, And I still can knock some more.  Ooh girl, ooh girl, is it feasible? I wanna know now, for I to knock some more. Ya see, in life I know there's lots of grief, But your love is my relief.

      haaaay.. my weekend's almost over. Nevertheless, I had a great one, even if it was as laid back as ever here in LB.  At least, I got to watch Spiderman 2 a little on time, and in the big screen. The movie was definitely not disappointing for me. We've been doing a reasonable amount of reviewing too, Joy and I.  'Better take advantage of the "sinisipag akong mag-aral" phases.  We also listened and reminisced and criticized whatever CDs we had over the weekend.. we bought the three Almost Kinda Acoustic albums (1-3) tsktsk.. pirated of course (ssshhhhhh!!!)  Here're some that we rattled about:  *  Babyface  (Greatest Hits)        .. how good Babyface is and how many songs he must have already written.. how does he do it?!  And he's left-handed in playing the guitar.  *  50 First Dates  soundtrack       Some thought it's gonna be the usual CORNY.. SAPPY collection of love songs that'd make one wanna say eck.  But it really is not the usual.. it's sort of island-ish (even the movie, which for me, was good).. i mean, when you play the tracks, you could just close your eyes and see the coconut trees, sarongs, long hair flying, native huts, full moon, and a bunch of those ethnic  butingtings .      Some didn't even wanna see the movie or listen to the CD coz it's gonna be so mushy.. corny.. well I guess they just went ahead and said what they thought without even asking what it was about or how the songs actually sound.. hhh!      But ANYWAY, though most of the songs were just versions of the originals, they were quite good.  AND! Israel "IZ" Kamakawiwo'ole's "Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World" version was just awesome.. really great song to have been played at the end of the movie.. it's kinda unfortunate though that it's not in the soundtrack.  "Forgetful Lucy" was okay anyway, but not half as good.  *  A Walk to Remember  soundtrack     ..how it sounded represented like how it was in the movie..  Don't miss: Dare You to Move, Learning to Breathe, and You .. (yeah right, it WAS so long ago!)   Okay okay, we're leaving, 'have to end this.  Watch Spiderman!

      I'm dressed all in blue  And I'm remembering you  And the dress you wore  When you broke my heart   I'm depressed upstairs  And I'm remembering where  And when, and how, and why  You have to go so far   Am I gonna be lonely for the rest of my life  Am I gonna be lonely for the rest of my life  I'm gonna be lonely for the rest of my life  Unless you come around  So come around   I'm dressed all in white  And I remember the night  You came on to me  And opened up my heart   I was hollow then  'Til you filled me in  Now I'm empty again  I should have never let it start   Am I gonna be lonely for the rest of my life  Am I gonna be lonely for the rest of my life  I'm gonna be lonely for the rest of my life  Unless you come around  So come around   No one else can fix me  Although sometimes my heart tricks me  Into thinking someone else will do  But you're the only one  You are the only one   Am I gonna be lonely for the rest of my life  Am I gonna be lonely for the rest of my life  I'm gonna be lonely for the rest of my life  Unless you come around  So come around  So come around  So come around   I'm dressed all in blue  And I'm remembering you  And the dress you wore  When you broke my heart                      Rhett Miller

      I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That's why I need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is You..

      'Just got back.. my roommate Joy and I watched Spiderman 2.  It was pretty good, and I think I like it better than the first.  Had me "on the edge of my seat".. harhar..   I guess it was more bracing and dramatic this time, even about the Peter Parker-Mary Jane ka-chuchuhan.  It still had the "wise words" like last time, like Uncle Ben telling Peter that with great power comes great responsibility.  This time, it was something like doing what's right, even if you think it's not what you want or if doing it is gonna take you away from what you want or wanna do. It was touching, the part when Peter's aunt was telling him about how there is in each of us a hero.. and how despite all of Peter's revelations to her, she still loved him,  and that she was finally able to move on after her beloved Ben's passing away.  And about what MJ did at the end of the movie, it was just so bold.. didn't expect her to do it until  the last minute.  It was a fabulous performace .. it was definitely deeper than the first one, communciating heroism.. dreams.. love.. choices.  And oh oh oh, James Franco was handsome.. kinda hunk-ish I guess.. (tsk) and he looked smart..sassy..chic in his character in the movie, though it's such a tragic thing about his complicated friendship with Peter.  But anyway, I'm glad we watched it tonight, 'had a splendid time.

      yoohoooo!!! it's already the weekend for me! 'Met two freshmen earlier, and we had dinner together, together with my other cellmates.  We all met at the Youth Jam, the weekly Midweek Service, held on Wednesdays and Thursdays. The Word was about running the Christian race - running it well and ending up being a winner.  It was all about DETERMINATION, DIRECTION, DISCIPLINE.  Determination to run and finish the race well, direction to tell you which way to go so you don't go about your life aimlessly, and discipline to get you to do things right away and excellently.  What struck me the most was what the pastor quoted, frm Helen Keller:          The greatest tragedy in life is people who have sight but no vision.    Helen said that when she was asked what could be worse than being born blind.  Can you imagine that.. It made me look at myself and really think, do I have purpose? Am I living my life in such a way that when I look back, I'll really have no regrets?  I'm working on it :)
