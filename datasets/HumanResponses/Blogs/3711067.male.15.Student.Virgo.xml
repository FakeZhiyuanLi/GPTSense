      My heart, Ever so warm and beating, Is slowly bleeding w/e is left of my love: Shown through the layers above: Seen by the eyes who gaze upon this "God's" creation; So many expect something great; In an impatient anticipation! Like a gardener waiting for his rose to bloom; Leads to a foreshadowing of self-destruction and doom; So there lies the suppressed genius of many of our generation; The devastation of a proclamation hardly ever to enforce; Frustratingly and over embellished like course; An everlasting obstacle in which we are not allowed to overcome; So there are our gifts, Unused and numb... Thank you.

      Sometimes it’s hard being right and knowing the truth, Sometimes it’s too hard, and you compromise your youth,  You live to forget what you once learned, You live to forget what you once yearned,  You Hate To admit it,  Inside You let out a cry... Just toughen up you can’t live a lie. Old friends will go, and old crushes will be faded, You’re older ideas look so jaded, A kid no longer, A Person no more, You no longer control the score, Is it fate? Is it yet you? You’ve become so lost you don’t know what to do… Time increases and so does the strain, Strain increases and so does the pain,  But pain is weakness, Weakness is wrong, So correct the mistake, Become strong.

      The sun begins to rise, The light fills my eyes, A happiness to gain, A loss of all this pain, It’s another new beginning,  It’s the start of another’s end, The white light hits the glass now, The white light begins to bend. A flash of color, A smile deep inside, A realization of love, No more reason to hide.

      Special Feeling Someone, I Miss, Each Moment without them, Lost without my own bliss, In words I express how I feel, Each moment in time, Each moment unreal, Diamonds for eyes, Mind told, Each moment without her, Emptiness, Cold.

      The snow flies peacefully to the ground, The air is tranquil, There is hardly a sound, Only the sound of your breath can be heard, Only the sound of a bird, The trees all around you, So luscious, so Green, The smell of pine, Lovely, So keen, You’re lost in your place where you can think, Your worries your depression begins to sink. There’s a place within all of us, It’s inside, When we’re alone, We can calmly hide, No worries can get us, Where no one has spied. Don’t quicken step, Slow down your stride, Rebuild your pride. Happiness builds and a smile is about to begin, Forget your worries, Forget your sin, Calm your body, Calm your whole, Calm yourself, Calm your soul.

      Stars For Eyes Deep they flicker, Torching the Night sky Each flicker faded into a seeming less sigh, Piercing bright they catch my eye, Bright… As almost an attention grabbing cry, In amazement… Lost and without a care… Blindly I stare, Gorgeous… More than any word could ever mean, Diamonds…the glow so very keen, Poetry its own way, Shining through, To brighten my day… Blindly I stare, No words to say, Sometimes faded by the droplets, But surely, they show through, Stars…and eyes…both belong to you.

      Peddle by Peddle… They hit the floor, Till the once gorgeous Rose, Is gorgeous no more. The color is gone. No more a gorgeous rose.  The thorns have hardened, This rose is dead. One after another, Each flower dies, Like human after human, Unheard cries.  But like the roses, A new one blooms each day, With color so bright… As if to say… Something spectacular, That each person can read, From each dieing rose, Comes many a seed.  And the planted shall rise, Come out full force.  Our life like the rose, Sometimes jagged and course, But the outcome is the bloom, Only to fade as the peddles pass.  Looking through a tinted glass… So our memories too faded, Like the coming of age, Minds so jaded, The end passes. Our memories will die, Each peddle, Each Rose, An unheard cry.

      My Strength Dwindles Under The Weight Of The Pain… I'm Weak Even With The Strength Against The Cane… My legs Begin To Weaken… By Walking my Muscles Strain… I’ve Given Into No Pressure But The Pressure I Gave In My Years… I Gave Into The Pressure… The concoction Of Those tears… A Mixture Of Depression.  Suppression.  Confession. I gave in because I could no longer last Each Continuous Blast … Sinking … Sinking deeper is my belonged fate … No longer being able to think straight … Giving into  Profanity… Humanity… Insanity… Low… And Embracing…

      It’s happened before,  It’s not unknown, It’s more often then not,  Only consequences are shown.  Bloody Hands,  But a clean mind, So many answers, It’s now the question you can’t find, Is it now the inverse? You die before you live, And you’re punished before you lie, You often find the answer, Even before you can think to ask why. You start with a shine and end with a glow, You clap or hiss, Before the start of the show, Sorted Confusion,
