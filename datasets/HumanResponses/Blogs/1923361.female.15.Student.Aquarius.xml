      He cares little for me, that I know. I said once that he was selfish, and he stil is. I know there is no future in pursuing a relationship with him, yet I still yearn for his love, his touch, his presence.   In conclusion, I am deprived.  It'd be nice to have a guy around again.   That guy shouldn't be him, by, well, everyone's standards. Its not like he's the only guy, or girl for that matter, who has wanted me to be their significant other. Yet I've spent the last two years, from the point of our breakup, rejecting every soul that has the misfortune to ask me out.   This is of course, not to say that I'm nice and likable and easy to fall in love with. I'd see it more likely as they think I'm the type who wouldn't say no to a relationship.  Well, I always tell myself that I wouldn't say no. Because its always nice to know that there's someone out there thinking about you, missing you and yearning for your presence in your absence. And its always nice to have a good cuddle, but thats all puppy love. And as beneficial as it may seem, it is not enough to interest me.  It would also be odd to look for committment at fifteen years of age, because I for one, must admit that committment is one of my greatest fears, and therefore also a task I find close to impossible to complete.   At fifteen, what are the chances of you finding a guy who you can foresee, in ten years time, married to?  Unfortunately, that is precisely the kind of man I want. The kind I want to have a stable relationship and settle down with.   It is not as if I've had many a flings.   Maybe I just need a brother, a really close male friend.  I'd say I have one, or two.   But its not the same is it?   Lol.  Bugger.

      My head is just spinning. &nbsp; I wish he wouldn't say the things he says. I wish we were closer. I wish things were different. &nbsp; He was the kind of the guy I would like to have married, eventually. Even if everyone else believes that he is less than exampliary for me.  &nbsp; It hurt to have to snap at him again. It hurt to hear him say that my depression saddens him 'somewhat'. &nbsp; I just want it to be over. I just want to get over him.

      I ought to know, that any man to have taste bad enough to fall in love with me, would in turn fall in love with other equally fucked up undesirable imbeciles.  I have cried enough, these past two years. And I have cried again, and I know that this will not be the last time I shed tears for him, him whom my friends deem unworthy, him whom my friends would beat up if he continues to be the cause of my misery.  But then again, my misery is no other's fault but mine.   I've let him down too many times. The fact that he still talks to me is even a miracle. I ought to be grateful. I ought to be happy for him.  But I'm human. I'm a fucking girl. And I can't.

      Well I thought it'd never end. Our on/off infatuation with each other. We were never in love were we? Just two lonesome people with lousy taste in the opposite sex and a desperate need to feel loved.   But hell, it still hurts. Sure, in the one year and six months since we've broken up, in the two years since we've known each other, there'd be other girls you liked. Hell, the first time I met you, you were going after another girl. After we broke up, there were two others. But I never felt the finality even then, somehow I'd always knew.. somehow.. you'd ask me again. But we never did work out to begin with. I doubt you ever did, with the other girls. You were never much of a ladies' man. You care too much about yourself. You still do.   You're still as self-centered as you ever were from the first day I knew you. Still as selfish and ungentlemanly and still ignorant. Still living in your own dream world. Hah.  I don't know. Its time to let go. I have to tell myself this every day. Let the fucking hell go of you.   There'd be someone else for me. Someone who deserves me. Someone who will treat me the way I deserve to be treated....  I'd always know that someone isn't you, but that never stopped me from yearning after you cause when you're fifteen, the choices come across as reasonably limited.   Especially when most of my choices are females whom I feel are not ready to even think about getting into a relationship.  And I'm not a guy. I can't keep playing the role of a guy in BOTH female and male relationships. Its stupid. I want to be treated like a girl. I want to let myself behave like one.   Whatever. Haha. That someday will come. It just isn't time for me to be me yet.
