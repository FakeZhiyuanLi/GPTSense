       Hello my friend, we meet again It's been awhile, where should we begin? Feels like forever Within my heart are memories Of perfect love that you gave to me Oh, I remember   When you are with me, I'm free I'm careless, I believe Above all the others we'll fly This brings tears to my eyes My sacrifice    Your a Fruitcake...   Ima sittin in my chair twiddling my thumbs....actually i dont think i have thumbs. Im waiting for the chicken lord to come down and bless me by taking me into his haven. He's late again.  I wonder what people would think if they saw this blog-a-licious blog. They'd probably think I was high.  I wish...  I had Mr. watsis name come to see me today, he spoke bout getting high and dying. And drinking and dying. And smoking and dying.  Looootsa dying Quite depressing, if there hadnt been dancing circus bears in my hallucinations at the time.

       How the hell did we wind up like this? Why weren’t we able? To see the signs that we missed try to turn the tables. I wish you would unclench your fists, And unpack your suitcase lately theres been to much of this but don’t think its too late  nothings wrong just as long as you know that someday I will someday some how gonna make it alright, but not right now I know you’re wondering when     *sniff* video clips so sad   You know, I've put an effort into posting as many random comments on random blogs as possible. Quite amusing, but noone seems to post to me. What is wrong with me that I can't make friends on the internet? the  INTERNET !! This is the place where 50 year old men plot to meet girls sporting the prime of the adolescence in parks, disguised as a pre pubescent boys.  Not that thats what I do......  Some people who HAVE NOT POSTED on my blog have been asking me what 'cirkus bear' represents. Well, for all my vigilant fans out there, it was originally 'dancing circus bear', as I once had a halucination of a brown bear, wearing a green and pink polka dotted party hat with a bright pink pom-pom on the end. He was dancing in an odd fashion, hopping from foot to foot to the tune that goes 'doo doo do do do do doo doo doooo doo'. Great description there.  Anyhoo, I'm to bored to write about myself anymore, I'll go write about other people in their blogs.

       Come notice me And take my hand So why are we Strangers when Our love is strong Why carry on without me?  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby    this song makes me sad.   it is a britney spears song and therfore i hate it. as i have hated her ever since i grew old enough to see that she was a skanky, self infatuated, consumer made hoe. oh well, nothings perfect.  what i DO like about it is that it a nice song... and that the fact that it is a nice song had nothing to do with britney spears, because she isn't smart enough to write her own songs or make up the lyrics.  i love music... it makes me feel uber good. my favorites change all the time and i like all sorts of styles. sometimes they sound like they are being played at the exact right moment in my life... like a coreographed movie scene......... freaky huh.  oh well, enough of my pointless ramblings..... i wish i could get a picture... for some reason blogger won't let me...  anywho, see you later singing off HUZZAH! oh and i hate britney spears.....
