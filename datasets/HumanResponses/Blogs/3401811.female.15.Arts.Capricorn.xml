Iarrra! I'm only going to be home for ... about 5 more weeks before i go away for a month and i've seen nearly none of my friends for the past 2 weeks. And it's gay. And i wanna go for a swim. Or maybe get invited somewhere. And perhaps not have to invite myself someplace. Yeah. That'd be cool. Ah well.  later peoples, i'll stop complaining maybe.   *am i in europe yet?*  (8) i laugh the hardest, who'd've known?!*

      Today i went with my mum and Tanya to get baby shower gifts!! it was pretty fun... mum got me a skirt for the trip and me and Tanya had a frappucino...mmmmmmm... We were on our way home when we suddenly felt a jolt, swerved out of control and stopped in the middle of the road. Can you just imagine the rim of our front wheel spinning by itself down the road. My goodness. Freaking scary. At first glance it just looked like the rim had fell off, but we knew by the fact that the car wouldn't drive, and that crazy bump action that that wasn't the only problem. The ball joint broke, and the wheel was ... well, not attached to the car any longer. We called my dad and CAA and they towed it a half hour later. A lot of people are nice. At least 10 asked if we needeed any help, a few were rude though, shaking their heads as if we just decided that would be a cozy place to have a picnic. Losers! So i got home at...oh quarter to 6, the time i was supposed to be at Katie's to meet for DODGEBALL! I got to her place at ... 6:05. The car shananigans didn't take too long i guess.... and my dad drove off in our van. By the time we got in Katie's van to leave, my dad was back asking, "oh, you didn't want me to drive you tot he movi...okay just making sure....*mutter* aww i love him so much it was awesome! ... heehee... soooo the movie was pretty hilarious, i'd recommend it ;);) ... if you like retarded-funny-laugh-ass-off kinda funny... and/or Ben Stiller.  soooooo how did that dance turn out Kris...? didja go? Tomorrow i get to vacuum! wooh, wooh! *go, GO, GO!!!*... haha... bit of a private joke there... ^o).... aaanyway, gonna go watch the end of the re-run game... byeeeE          <3<3<3 viva italia <3<3<3  :(

             mmm... pickle chips... So today was lazy! i didn't do too much, relaxed and found some hotels in Rome for us :) that's the only place we need to book yet! *sigh*          Last night we rented 50 first dates after dim sum! that chinese food was really good... i just had soccer a bit ago and we won 3-1!! i had to be goalie.. ugh! and i let a goal in :( but it was still good... i saved lots;) .... so today my mum was super pissed at my sis... she took the car to toronto without asking, and she lied about where she was going. Soooo... yeah! i don't want to go throught that gah i would've hated to be in her place. So i guess i'll just have to be perfect..? or a better liar. i like the thought of the former better, but, i'll need a lil' luck with that. Anyway.   <3

      Just finished supper...pork chops and left over chinese food. it was pretty grood. Today was pretty fun... i was planning on staying home and doin stuff but my mum wanted me to come with them to stratford and go to my gramma's, so i did that... we bought some luggage for our trip, then we walked around stratford.They have some awesome shops and stuff. So then we went to gramma's for a bit and came home. It was cool... lol so then it started to suck when we came home --  my sis said she isn't goin to her soccer game because she's tired from work and staying out all last night -- which my parents didnt know about. She never told them she wasn't gonna come home. Crazy angst-ridden 20 year olds. So my ma's all pissed that we planned out whole day around goin to the game --blah blah--door slamms-- blah --i run away--blah blah. Ah well. Tomorrow is gonna be awesome fun. Mom says she doesnt want me on the compy so much anymore...so i gotta sneak away soon. My new skirt makes me happy...therefore i'm wearing it tomorrow. bye!  <3<3

        You have a mysterious kiss.  Your partner never knows what you're going to come up with next; this creates great excitement and arousal never knowing what to expect.  And it's sure to end in a kiss as great as your mystery.

      heyy today was nice... we went to toronto to visit my first cousin ever Roy John Paul Blanchard.. R.J :) i had an iced capp in the car :D  the baby was feeding when we got there, but soon enough he came to see us... haha. He's four days old. I held him and he is gorgeous... and likes me the best;) my dad held him and my gramma was being funny and weird and grand-maternal, she's like "give him back to gramma" and my dad's all stubborn, well he had only held him for two minutes... anyway it was funny, my gramma almost smacked him one :s... weird. RJ is tiny... and has these long legs and fingers and toes, he held my finger. i held him for a really long time, he only cried once the whole time we were there, when he was hungry again. He has lots of hair. it made me feel so happy... innocent fragile little prince he is.                     :)  we drove my gramma home and then went to get chinese food. i was sooooo hungry it was really good. My fortune cookie said, "good things are being said about you." um. didn't seem to ring quite too true, even though i hate being sceptical about generic pieces of paper fortunes. But, good to know i guess. tomorrow i have soccer, that's all really! should be a fun game...  xo0x

      &nbsp;  Quote of the Day--    &nbsp;  (me, in disbelief) - "They, have a dud tree?!"    &nbsp;  (my dad, bein cool without knowing it as usual) - They have a dud.. Natalie they have a MOTHER of a dud tree!"  &nbsp;  today i got up and watched some tv and had a shower and got ready and went to pick up Cass and went to the mall. we looked around a bit and asked for samples, lol, and she bought 2 shirts and we went to see king arthur. It was pretty good, a lot like LOTR though. But not as good. but it was still good. and Keira Knightly was cool. then i came home and ate dinner and we talked about our trip... my dad called his cousin today and asked what they need and stuff, lol, my dad hears&nbsp;one of the kids say in the background, "Pants!" lmfao ohhh my it was the most hilarious picture. "I dunno if he actually wants pants or he was just practising his english!" my dad tells me. haha i'm getting excited. one of the boys is 12 and the other's 17. heh. i don't wanna leave once i get there. well maybe i will, but i mean the longest i'm gonna stay in one place is 10 days, i think i'm gonna miss my cousins&nbsp;when we leave... hah. No drinking age! LoL! well anyway!  &nbsp;

Tv. and computer. then i ate a sausage and mum asked if i wanted to go for a swim and i said not really then 5 minutes later i decided i changed my mind. we left and these men in a lexus stopped beside us to say there was an "accident" and that the pool was gonna be closed tonight. gah. so we walked around the block and back here and i tried calling a couple people... twice and nobody answered. wasn't really expecting them to anyway. it's hot in here. seein' a movie tomorrow. that should be fun:)  &nbsp; i'm gonna go collapse on the couch now &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   % why, when you are up must they bring you down, so low they can't even see you cry, they make you despise... i just want you to be happy%

        Today was fun :)   I got up around 9 and hung around... my grampa came over for a bit and then i had a bath and got ready. @ 1:30 Heather, Nina, Katie, Lauren and Shantelle came over. We went swimming for like 2 hours and these little boys were throwing balls at us so we threw them back! lol then we went back to my place and those kids came by my house, they were with their babysitter... a guy our age who goes to bluevale. We started eatin' and watching Chasing Liberty and they rang my doorbell and ran away. They left a note that said " The guy in the black shirt likes the girl in the red suit... come over if you're interested" HA! the guy our age liked Katie :p so we continued the movie... Katie was kinda embarassed -- and not interested! about ten minutes later they rang again... they left a note again that said "we're waiting" it was kinda creepy! i saw them looking at me from behind the tree across the street lmao Nina was very confused at how they ran away so fast after ringing! We decided to go over! the little kid lives right down the street. So we were waiting for the "guy in the black shirt" (Josh, as we later found out) to come out but he was bein' shy! We started to play basketball - it was fun stuff! he was about to come out but he got the other kid to ask if we were the same age and he went back in... wanna guess what me nina and heather did next?.................................... oh we went in! Well they left both doors RIGHT open what did they expect..? lol.. it was hilarious... Josh was kinda embarassed or something but we kept talking to him as he watched the ludicrus video and the boys stood there laughing... Heather realized that the kid's Mom got home and so we ran away... she definitely saw us. Six girls at her house while the 15 year old babysitter watched her son and two friends. We're retarded. Holy crap it was funny... we thought we were definitely gonna get him fired! but the 2 kids came by AGAIN and gave Katie Josh's number!!! which they forgot and went back and came back AGAIN to go get it. I asked him if his mom saw us and what she said and the kid said "She said she didn't want you guys in the house" ... and that's all! i was reaaally suprised actually. I hope he wasn't fired. Eek. He said he was gonna be there tomorrow and oh my gosh I told him Katie wasn't gonna be! What a tard. Oh yes when we were on our way back from the pool some guy that talks to Nina..? i dunno two guys who go to wci talked to us and asked what we were doin tonight and we said ... " we dunno, what are you doin?" and they said "goin to a party, you guys wanna come?!?" HAHA! random people asking us to go to some party of some person we don't know..? ok then..! i asked where and they said paradise, that's actually pretty close! we went for a walk and played at the playground, and picked wildflowers and frolicked in the grass.. heh heh. We also played some pool and me and Shantelle kicked ass!! wo0t! i really didn't like the movie chasing liberty :s it was kinda random and stuff... here's me "NOw why is she suddenly at Harvard!? ugh! this is bugging me!" As my friends calmly explain to me that oh she goes to school there! They introduce that in the last ten minutes of the movie, dumb thing! Mandy Moore acted pretty awfully in it..! well maybe it was just that i didn't like her character, but either way! i was very happy they came over i had a very fun time!!!!! * like to spend 8 hours with people and not get bored * ;);) you know what i'm talkin about  oxoxox long post oxoxoxox peace            <3you

      today was a very fun day!!! i got up at around 10:30 and ate some fruit and got ready... tanya drove me to Katie's around 1:30 and Shantelle got there at the same time. We went into Katie's new hot tub and mMmMmm it was so nice! A while later Heather and Sam showed up and we hopped in the pool. we played volleyball and floated on the floaty things and laid there on the deck! we noticed that Sam had a wicked awful burn on her back and it was soo red... we kinda laughed at her a little bit but it looked bad! Katie made some hotdogs and we ate some chips and cookies and then ice cream cones **pro scooper** haha i was gonna write pro spooner but i didn't :p lol it would have been painfully true... just kidding ! the food was all reallly good. we kept going back and forth between the pool and the hottub it was awesome! Emma came by while we were in the hottub but she didn't stay too long... long enough to feed us cookeies and stick her feet in the pool/ hands in the hottub and chat though :p we went for a bikeride and visited Lauren... and boys whisted at us... lol namely Sam wearing her bathing suit top heh heh hun. we biked Sam and Heather home and oh yeah Shantelle left earlier to go out for dinner. Then me and Katie went back to her house and my parents picked me up a bit later! we went to the mall for a few minutes and then the grocery store and then home :D OH yeah!! We realized that my arms... and back... and cheeks were just as badly burnt as Sam! yeah! it just took way longer to show up! Stupid stupid deceiving cloud cover! DAMNN YOUU! tomorrow i think i have to clean so i probably won't be doing too much else... oh and i have a soccer game. Some people are gonna  come over on Thursday so we have to make the plans... and i already invited a lotta peoples so if i don't invite you it's not because i don't love you it's because i can't have 10 people over!   oxox

      I think I'm broke.  My whole leg is in stupid pain from stupid soccer. And i either pulled a muscle in my side or have a hernia. Maybe i'm just paranoid about hernias, because my mum says she doesn't think i have one, because "i'm too healthy". ok. it feels really weird, who pulls a muscle in their side? me apparently! But aanyway! i'm excited for today because i'm going to watch donny brasco and go swimming :) wo0h0o!  <3

Her grandmother is so hilarious and nice she's like 4 foot 5. the shower didn't get started 'til 3, and we played some game things and ate food and we were all very full and happy. but my piece of chicken had a spine in it. it was weird. but the chicken tasted like kfc and they had cherries and salad and all sortsa crazy and good stuff, so that was good! so many hours later we left... and headed for home. when we got home i watched some tv and chatted on msn and drank some tea. i talked to Kris and she was very hyper! even for her!!! lol... so i'm going over there tomorrow. aand i'm gonna get up at 9. that means i have to go to sleep soon, so goodnight! xoxo  ***SOCCER FINAL TOMORROW!!!!!

        on monday i had a soccer game... it was alright but we didn't play very well. We tied 1-1... onn tuesday... i went to see The Notebook with cass and it was really good... aww very cute chick flick. We shopped around for a lil bit... After me and Cass went over to Iara's and we biked around for a bit... we went to see Kyle and he's crazy... haha they were making plans to see a movie on thursday. Then i got an ice cap and we went over to Kris' for a bit :) she wasn't feeling too peachy but it was nice seeing her anyway. Her pup Tucker was adorable and kept trying to eat me. Jess and Shanty came by but only for a few minutes. Theeen we left and Iara went home and me and Cassandra went to her place... we didn't do too much there and then my parents called to come pick us up, Cass came to sleep over: first time ever. We ate a barbequed chicken dinner at 10pm and then played some pool... quite a lot of pool actually. We went to bed at around 2 after talking for a long time. She woke up earrly! and we had breakfast and umm didn't do too much for a while... Tanya took us to sugar mountain while she went to the university to drop something off... then we came home and went to the pool! we swam for a really long time... i actually signed her in this time! then i went home to get ready for soccer and dad drove her home on the way.  There were 2 other people at the practice, silly girls. It was a pretty fun practice, we played a scrimmage with the other team and i scored a goal:) we won 3-1. Stupid other team. **shakes fist** don't even want to tell you about it. Brooke was on th'other team and she played for us during the scrimmage. She was good and it was nice seeing her. She has some dumb teammates though.  AAnyway. Happy birthday Canada  Yesterday i went with my family to Grand Bend. It was awesome weather, me and Tanya went swimming even though it was fricken cold. I laid in the sun for hours. Lol. I saw at least ten cute boys. And i ate ice cream. It was a good day. Todayy i did nothin'. Vacuumed and watched some movie on tv called dance 'til dawn. It was pretty good, matthew perry and what's her name were in it. Lol it's pretty old, perry was like 16, it was cute. Now my dad's at soccer and mum's at work and Tanya's at work, and i am lonely. Tomorrow we're going to toronto for my aunt's baby shower... i'm pretty excited about that :):) ummm so yeah that's about it later peoples   let's play, master and servant    *you don't feel me here...anymore*
