       "Well, what is it?" Chance asked picking Charlie up.  "Ummm, well...There is kind a shortage on rooms." Elijah said  "How much of a shortage?" Terrance asked.  "Ummm, well." Dom held a single key.  "What! There is only one room left!" Chance asked frightened.  "Yeah...The good news is it is a Suit." Elijah said  "Oh my god." Terrance mumbled under her breath.  "Well we better get up there and check out the bed situation." Chance said putting Charlie down.  They all got into the elevator, and went to there floor. They stepped out on there floor.  "Room 64." Dom said as he stood in front of the door. He opened the door, and Charlie charged in first.  "Oh my gosh." Chance said as she marveled at the beauty of the room.  "Were are the beds?" Elijah asked.  "Over here!" Terrance said.  They all walked intuit the room from were they hear her voice come from.  "Umm...theres a wee problem Ter, there are only two beds." Chacne said looking around the room.  "Well check the couch it may be a pull out." Dom said.  Chance walked into were the couch sat, she checked, and went back in the bed room.  "Of course its not a pull out!" She said throwing her arms in the air.  "Well me and Chance can share a bed." Terrance said. "I mean come on we are sisters, we us to take baths together." Chance smacked her sister on the arms. The guys just looked at them.  "That means me and Dom will have to sleep together." Elijah said.  "Yeah so...I thought you to got really close while filming?" Chance said as she sat down on the end of one of the beds.  "Yeah, but it would be weird...I mean to guys...meh." Dom said.  "Okay well I will take the couch, on account I am the shortest." Chance said.  "No, Chance we can't do that to you." Elijah said.  "I slept on the couch when I was a little girl all the time, didn't bother me one bit." She said.  "Well you can sleep, if it doesn't bother you, with me, I mean we won't be doing anything else except sleeping." Dom said.  "Yeah and then me and Elijah can-"  "Eww...Ter, stop were you are, know mental picture please." Chance said cutting her off. She then turned and looked at Dom, " Charlie would have to sleep with us too."  "Thats perfectly fine." Dom said picking Charlie up and kissing him on the head. Chance laughed.  "Alright I suppose." Chacne said.  "Otay scence that is all sorted out, what shall we do now." Terrance asked.  "Well I am going to take a shower." Chance said starting to unpack some of her stuff.  "I am going to unpack." Terrance said starting aswell. "Do wanna share this dresser guys?"  "Nah I am just going to leave my stuff in my bag" Dom said moving his bag to the corner of the room.  "Same with me." Elijah said.  "Suit yourself." Terrance said. "I guess its just you and me Chancy."  "I guess so." She said." Will you put my clothes away for me." Chance said with a smile. Terrance rolled her eyes.  "I suppose." Chance skipped into the bathroom.  The guys went in to the kitchen and the first thing they did was look for food and beer.  "There's know beer!" Elijah squealed.  "Were going to die!" Dom played along.  "Oh shut up you too!" Terrance yelled as she proceeded to though a pair of panties at them.  "Ohh panties!" Elijah said as he picked a lacy pair of underwear off the floor. Dom took them out of his hands.  "Are these yours Ter?" He called.  "Know there Chance's." She called back.  Dom shoved them into his back pocket.  "You slut." Elijah said pushing Dom. They both laughed.  Chance walked out of the steamy bathroom into the kitchen, with nothing but a towel on.  There were wolf whistles and shouting coming from Elijah and Dom whom were sitting on the couch with Charlie, watching Tom and Jerry. She just rolled her eyes. She got a Pepsi from the fridge and went back into the bed room.  Chance looked though the top drawer of the dresses from something comfy.  "I think these are yours love."

       Chance looked up at Dom.  Her eyes seemed to glow from the lack of lighting in the room.      "I think, Chance is..." Dom paused and looked at her for a moment, "I think she is the most-"      "Dommmiekens! There you are!"  Harmony came up behind Dom and wrapped her arms around his waist.  "Oh, hello, Clover."  Harmony said looking over Dom's shoulder.      "Her name is Chance."  Jamie said in defence.  Harmony just snarled at him.      "Harmony what-what are here?"  Dom asked nervously.      "I missed you pooh bear."  Harmony said, she could hear Elijah and Terrance giggling, she shot them a dirty look.  Then she just continued to twist a long piece of Dom's hair around her finger.      "Don't you think you are being a bit..you know clingy." Dom asked as nicely as he could.  Harmony was taken aback by this, she gasped and crossed her arms.  Chance rolled her eyes.      "What do you mean clingy?"      "You hanging around, following continuelesly, or in other words kinda stalking." Terrance chimmed in.      "I am doing know such thing.  I just want to be around Dom as much as-"      "I want to talk to you out side for a moment Harm."  He whispered into her ear, cutting her of also.      Awhile later Dom came in with a smile on his face and his hands in his pockets.      "What are you so happy about?" Elijah asked looking over Chance's shoulder on the computer.      "Ohh nothing...just got read of a lot of dead weight that was holding me down to this earth."  He said as he walked over to were Chance and Elijah were. "Were's Terrance and the boys, and for that the dogs."      "Terrance was trying to be superwoman and she offered to make then something to eat...but if you ask me it was just a deal for them not to pull her hair."  Chacne said, eyes glued to the computer screen.      "Well for one I think it is sweet."Elijah said.      "Your suppose to say that, she is your girlfriend..."  Chance said rolling her eyes, and finally detatching them from the computer screen.      "So what are we looking at here?"  Dom finally asked.      "Ohh it's for some concert there having in Seattle, it's for a really good cause to...all the money goes to Cancer research."  Elijah said.      "Ohh wow, we should totally go."  Dom said.      "I agree...It is for a really good cause and a lot of good bands are going to be there."  Chance said.      "Meh...I don't know...I love concerts and all but...don't you think it is a little short of notice." Elijah said unsurly.      "Billy Corgan will be there." Chance said flatly.      "Boys and girls pack your bags were going to Seattle!!!"  Elijah said jumping up from his chair.  All Chance and Dom did was laugh at Elijah attempt to dance.      "Okay I swear you just scared mine and your dog's out of the room."  Chance said laughing.  Elijah stuck his tongue out at her.  She mocked him and did the same.      "Whats going on it here?" Terrance came in with oven mits and a apron on.      "Ohh...Ter, are you going this seasons slutty house wife look?"  Chacne asked while leaning back on Dom and resting her head on his chest, not relizing what she was going.      "Ohh shut up...but really whats the dealy-o?"      "Were going to Seatlle."  Elijah said trying to calm himself down.      "All of us?"      "Yeah I guess why not?"  Elijah said looking over at Chance and Dom, Chance had gotten very comfy, and Dom looked like he was trying to put his arms around her without making her move, soon enough he did, she just looked down and laid her head back down.      "When is this thing....what is it by the way?"      "It's a concert...its for a veyr good cause, to help fight cancer, and it is in three days."  Elijah said sitting her down next to him on the couch.      "Well I guess it will be fun, I mean what else is there to do."  Terrance said pulling Jamie and Phillip close to her after the came into the room.      "So Dom," Jamie started.      "You still haven't said anything about Chance." Phillip finished.      Chance moved her head so she could look at him, obvisly really wanting to know what he was going to say.      "Well as I was saying before I think that she is-" Dom was cut off by Terrance.      "Ohh the cookies are done!"  Terrance got off and rushed to the kitchen, with Jamie, Phillip and Elijah following.  Elijah thought to give them some privacy, just what Dom wanted.      "I think you are the most beautiful woman in the world."  Dom whispered to her as her kissed her on the forehead gentaly.      "I think you are the most Beautiful guy in the world...or pretty...ugh you know what I mean."  Dom laughed and nodded his head in agreement.      Three long days had past, they were all finally on there way to Seattle.  Chance feel asleep on the flight with Charlie on her lap, she sat next to Dom who gladdly let her us his shoulder as a head rest.  Elijah and Terrance watched the movie they were showing on that flight,  Say Anything , a great film.      They soon arrived in Seattle, they all waited pacitnly for there luggage...Charlie stood on the side of the luggage machine thing and bark at every suitcase that passed, until Dom picked him up and held him.      They all smooshed into a cab and went to the hotel nearest the concert hall.  They arrived there shortly after 7 o'clock at night.  The guys went to go get there rooms, while the girls stood near the elevator.  The guys came back with a strange look on each of there face's.      "What is it guys?"  Terrance asked.

       Everyone jumped out of the pool with an grossed out look on there face, Elijah's eye were bloody red.      "Ewww...guys stop please...We have to clean that pool!" Kylha sqealed.  They then heard another moan.  Varies 'ewws' and 'yucks' can from every one.      Tiffani looked into Billy's eye, she was bitting her lip, his eyes gleamed with pleasure, Tiffani lent over and whispered in his ear.      "Maybe we should contiune this at another time and place."  Her voice was very seductive.  Billy looked at her and then pulled her in for on last passtionate kiss, there tongues met, he put his hand on her neck and pulled her in deeper.  The kiss ended.  They looked at each other and smiled.  Billy picked her up and carried her out of the pool.  He looked up and saw everyone staring at them.      "What like you guys that never done that before?" Tiffani asked.  Everyone looked at the person on there left and then there right, and then nodded there heads and some mumbled.  Tiffani laughed at her friends knowing some of the crazy stuff they have done.      "Okay now that Billy and Tiffani contaminated the pool, what can we do now?"  Elijah asked still rubbing his eyes.      "We can what a movie."  Kylah said.      "No more movies I think we have watched over 100 already with these boys."  Reese said.      "What do you suppose we do then?" Tiffani asked.      "We can go to the beach."  Joel suggested.      "Do you really want Tiffani and Billy hopping on the good foot and going the bad thing in the big blue?"  Reese asked.      "Well kids pee in there so...it can't be any worse."  Elijah said.      "Yeah what ever you say Wood."  Kylah said looking at him weird.      "Okay if we go we promise not to do anything bad."  Tiffani asid.      "Tiff, knowing you...I don't think that will be a set promise."  Reese said.  Tiffani glared at her.      "Well I suppose." Kylah said.  The girls changed into some dry bathing suits and loaded into, making a stop at every boys house to get there surf trunks, and surf boards.      "Billy your surf board is poking me!" Kylah cried.      "Hey, hey, hey, I am the only one his surf board is aloud to poke."  Tiffani said.      "Gross Tiff!"  Kylah said leaning foward, away from the board.        They got to the beach a bit later, they unloaded all of there stuff.  The boys charged to the water with there surf boards by there sides, on the other hand the girls layed there beach towels out, and then put up a umbrela, and then globbed on the sun screen, all laid back and relaxed.  The boys splashed each other as one another came back from a set.      The girls all felt the warmth of the sun on there skin and then there was a cold over come of there bodys.  They all took off there sunglasses and looked up, each one of there boys was standing above them.      "I swear Wood, you do it--" Elijah scooped Kylah up in his arms, even with her protesting he procided to drop her in the water, as all the other boys did to there girls.        "Oh its on like Donkey Kong now boys!"  Reese yelled pushing the hair out of her face.  The guys just laughed at all of then, until Tiffani tackled Billy.  Elijah and Joel looked each other with fear in there eyes, then Kylah and Reese tackled then as well.  After that it was a full on water war.  It lasted for hours, they all finally got tired.  Kylah raced Elijah out of the water to there stuff, truiphitly Kylah won, the rest slowly followed behind.  They packed up and went to the girls house.  They all dried up by standing in front of a big fan they had in the basement.      "I feel like a super model!" Kylah said going varies poses and then stuffing a cookie in her mouth.        "Yes a model, very well then..."  Tiffani said and took the remain cookie away from Kylah.      "Hey!"  Kylah said with a mouth full of cookie and some of it falling out of her mouth at the same time.      "You said you were a model, and that means you have to eat like a model."  Tiffani said eating the rest of the cookie.  Kylah pouted.      "Well girls I think he are going to head out...let you have fun with your cookie...thing...fight."Elijah said as he went over to kylah and kissed her goodbye.      "Alright." She said chewing the rest of the cookie.       Billy kissed Tiffani goodbye and said. " I will hold you to your word, about what you said in teh pool."  All Tiffani did was smile.      "Goodbye my beautiful raccoon."  Joel said as he kissed Reese.      "I am not a raccoon!" she said...she smiled and kissed him goodbye." Oh well a raccoon is a raccoon, and I still ain't one."  He smiled and left the room with all the other guys.      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      "Really?" Lilli said with tears in her eyes.      "Yes Lil, you are."  Dom said smiling at her.  Lilli pulled him into a hug, when she pulled back she looked into his stormy blue eyes and thought to her self ' Lil, you got to tell him, don't put this off, you can do it, just say it!'   She smiled at him.      "Dom as long as I have known you I have seen that you are the party in the bunch, youlive on the edge...I think...I think I need that in my life, just fi you do me one favour."  Dom's eyes lite up.      "Anything for you my dear."      "I need you, tomorrow my mum is having a fashion show thing and I want to prove to her that I am something, that I can get someone, as a girl she thought of me as nothing and we never talked and I want to show her I have changed."      "Lilli, I would be hornored to do this for you.  But If you do this favour for me."      "Yes."  She stepped closer to him.      "Let this be our first date, or something like it, giving us a chance earlier that we should...even if it is a bit fast..."  Lilli looked around her room a bit and thought,   Lilli he can all the way to New York for you, you know you love him as well and this may just help you realease a bit of your true fellings.         "Okay."  Dom smiled and kissed her on the forehead.      "Goodnight love."  He said that and shout the door.      Lilli wen to her bed and laid on her back and looked at the ceiling, she wanted to sqeal but had the fear of him hearing her.  She had fallen asleep at about 11:00 pm, she was a peaceful one when she slept, but when awoken.      At 5:25 pm...she heard foot steps in her room...she slowly turned over to see Dom kneeling by the side of her bed.      "How can you possible sleep this long?"      "I have know clue...it just comes naturaly."  Dom laughed.      "Well princess you better get up...I have know clue when this thing starts, but it is almost6 pm and I am betting you would like to have your hair dry when you go to this thing so you don't catch a cold."      Lilli groaned and slide out of the bed and feel on the floor infront of Dom and looked up at him...      "Meh."  She said.      "Come on get up."  Dom said picking her up and sitting her on the bed...      "I am going to get in the shower, we have to be the at about 7:30."  She said slummping.      "Okay I am going to get ready to...come over when you are ready to go."      A few hours later there was a knock at Doms door, he opened it and was amazed.  Lilli stepped in to his room (wearing these dress-- urlLink http://www.dresses.com/pop/pop1086l.html       "You look, amazing Lil."  He said taking her hands.      "Thanks, so do you." She said playing with his tie. "So here's the dealy-o, we have to act like when we have been together for a bit...know each other...and stuff like that, otay."      "Otay!" he said mocking her.  She laughed at the expersion on his face.      They walked out of the building and got in the limo Lilli's mum sent for her.  They got there and the stepped out of the limo and flashes went off in there faces....Lilli rushed in...she hated having her picture taken, Dom followed behind her.   Lilli stood back stage next to Dom....and then she saw her...her mum.

      My best friend is  getting married, yeah wonderful I know...She was to  find dresses for the bride's maid and herself, and that will not be easy on account that I have know fashion scence to help...(every day I have been out with her looking non-stop for a dress, and I am incharge of the bride's maids dress...meh), and my mum passed away when I was a wee girl so I grew up with a whole mess of brothers on a sheep farm in Scotland....blah I know.  The whole being elegante and shit on your wedding day is a big thing for me friend...so I have to be a good girl and go as I am told...I don't mind though, it is just hard...I have never been so close to a guy that he would even think of proposing...she is a lucky lucky girl...Very nice man he is...I wanna find someone like that one day...he reminds me of an old friend of mine, Ahh Yes, Parker, A very very fine young man he was, his father helped my father on our sheep farm...fun fun fun...And to start with my life as a wee lass...meh...I grew up on a sheep farm a little way outside of Glasgow, Scotland.  We had about 800 acres of land, and every morning my brothers and I would all wake up at 3:00 and eat breakfest...and then we would be out from 3:30 am to 6:30 pm.  After that we would get cleaned up and have awee snack and then we would have classes (home schooling.)  After that it was supper and then off to bed.  It was like that pretty much every day except Sunday's and Mondays.  Sunday we had Mase, and on Monday, that was pretty much our day off...for the kids and some of the adults...(mostly the cow hands or sheep hands if you please.)  Me father got re-married when I was 8 years old.  He married a evil woman...a very rich one though (she one the lottary in the states.)  About three years later she had had one child with my father and that was it..she divorced him and took there child with her.  Me Father never re-married after that.  Ahh and the year I turned my sweet 16, I was shipped off to the states to live with my evil rich step mum in New York City...I lost my accent and enrolled in a Catholic school.  I was forced to were little nacny girl clothes..I was rather small for me age though, still am too.  When I turned 18 I started to go to Yale for 2 years and then quit and went back to NYC and started at a Fashion School and a got a degree in Music Managent.  I left NYC after those few years when I was 24, my mother gave me some money enough to get my own house and settle down (the one nice thing she did.)  I moved to LA and I have a nice house in the Hills, I am a surfer and Skateboarder, my sister lives with me and I have one dog (Yorkie-Niki) and I plan to open my own Hair salon/ Fashion Studio, if not any of those a Record company.  My life turned out very good, I am very great full for the life I have lived...I am happy now...I always was...and If you don't mind I am going to listen to some Random 80's hits now .
