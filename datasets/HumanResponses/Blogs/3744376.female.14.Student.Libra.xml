      [Spoken] Folks, I'd like to sing a song about the American Dream. About me. About you. The way our American hearts beat down in the bottom of our chests. About the special feeling we get in the cockles of our hearts, maybe below the cockles, maybe in the sub-cockle area. Maybe in the liver. Maybe in the kidneys. Maybe even in the colon, we don't know.  I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job I'm your average white suburbanite slob I like football and porno and books about war I've got an average house with a nic hardwood floor My wife and my job, my kids and my car My feet on my table, and a cuban cigar  But sometimes that just ain't enough to keep a man like me interested (Oh no) No Way (Uh-uh) No, I've gotta go out and have fun At someone else's expense (Oh yeah) Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  I drive really slow in the ultrafast lane While people behind me are going insane  I'm an asshole (He's an asshole, what an asshole) I'm an asshole (He's an asshole, such an asshole)  I use public toilets and piss on the seat I walk around in the summertime saying, "How about this heat?"  I'm an asshole (He's an asshole, what an asshole) I'm an asshole (He's the world's biggest asshole)  Sometimes I park in handicapped spaces While handicapped people make handicapped faces  I'm an asshole (He's an asshole, what an asshole) I'm an asshole (He's a real fucking asshole)  Maybe I shouldn't be singing this song Ranting and raving and carrying on Maybe they're right when they tell me I'm wrong  Naaaah!  I'm an asshole (He's an asshole, what an asshole) I'm an asshole (He's the world's biggest asshole)  [Spoken] You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get myself a 1967 Cadillac El Dorado convertible, hot pink with whaleskin hub caps and all leather cow interior and big brown baby seal eyes for headlights, yeah! And I'm gonna drive around in that baby at 115mph getting one mile per gallon, sucking down quarter pounder cheese burgers from McDonald's in the old-fashioned non-biodegradable styrofoam containers and when I'm done sucking down those grease ball burgers, I'm gonna wipe my mouth with the American flag and then I'm gonna toss the styrofoam container right out the side and there ain't a God damned thing anybody can do about it. YOu know why? Because we got the bombs, that's why.  [Spoken] Two words. Nuclear fucking weapons, okay?! Russia, Germany, Romania - they can have all the Democracy they want. They can have a big democracy cake-walk right through the middle of Tiananmen square and it won't make a lick of difference because we've got the bombs, okay?! John Wayne's not dead - he's frozen. And as soon as we find the cure for cancer we're gonna thaw out the duke and he's gonna be pretty pissed off. You know why? Have you ever taken a cold shower? Well multiple that by 15-million times, that's how pissed off the Duke's gonna be. I'm gonna get the Duke and John Cassavetes... (Hey) and Lee Marvin (Hey) and Sam Pekinpah (Hey) And a case of Whiskey and drive down to Texas... (Hey, you know you really are an asshole) Why don't you just shut-up and sing the song pal!  I'm an asshole (He's an asshole, what an asshole) I'm an asshole (He's the world's biggest asshole)  A-S-S-H-O-L-E Everybody! A-S-S-H-O-L-E  [Barking] Arf Arf Arf Arf Arf Arf Arf Fung achng tum a fung tum a fling chum Oooh Oooh  [Spoken] I'm an asshole and proud of it!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But then we rode are bikes to the libary how cool is that.. I got the book Amoung the Imposters haha im cool.Then I played basketball outside with Ben and Blake, those kids are soo cool.Then i was going to take a shower and so i moved this mirror and i broke like a little bit off and i cut my self so then i was bleeding all over, and breaking a mirror means 7 yrs bad luck! o shit, what have i gotten myself into!lol. then i took a shower got ready for my softball games. So we went to Koch to do batting practice, then we played are games.i had NOO idea i was going to be pitching, but we have no fuckin good pitchers so he wanted me to try it, and wow i pitched the whole 9 inning game.. and we won FINALLY 21 to 16 man i was so happy. the second game went horrible i got hit w/ the ball in the ankle and its soo bruised it hurts so freakin bad. so i had to sit out but then i wanted to go in so i told him to put me in left field and i made some awesome catches there. i dived for the balls woo it was fun! and then we went to MCdonalds yummuy.. saw cammie and kallie said hi to them. there cool. n now im here icing my ankle it hurts like hell. and now we're going to watch mystic river..so i will catch ya all l8tr!

       Here are some quotes that i stole from brandi because she's the coolest    1- It's really cool when 3 strangers become best friends, But it's really sad when 3 best friends become strangers    2-    *You hug him goodbye like it's nothing, While all you want to go is hold on forever, But you let go, Smile and walk away, Then cry all the way home because you know it will never be the same, Because try as you might, You can't change fate, Sometimes you have to let them be free, And letting go... That is when love hurts the most.         3- The sky has lost it's color, The sun has turned grey, At least that's how it feels to me, Whenever you're away    4- It's not that I wanna be the only girl in your life, I just wanna be the only one that matters    5- Love is one of those crazy things, That no matter how hard you try, You just can't find the words, To tell what you're feeling inside    6- Somewhere between all of our Laughs, Long talks, Stupid little fights, And all of our jokes, I fell in love    7- People that laugh a lot cry a lot, Because it only takes one smile to hide a million tears    8- Once in your life you'll find someone who will turn your world around, And pick you up when you're feeling down, Don't worry about missing someone from your past, Cause there's a reason they didn't make it to your future    9- If you look inside a girl's heart, You'd see how much she really cries, You'll find hidden secrets, Best Friends, and Lies. But what you'll see the most, If how hard it is to stay strong, When nothing's right, and everything's wrong    10- Life doesn't hurt until you have time to yourself to think how things have changed... Who you lost along the way and just how much of it's your fault                  My heart is barely beating.             survey                  --Your Favorite on opposite sex--  Hair Color:: Brown :-) Eye Color:: Brown/Green (Their)Music Genre Preference::  punk/rock!

       And I'd give up forever to touch you Cause I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't want to go home right now  And all I can taste is this moment And all I can breathe is your life And sooner or later it's over I just don't want to miss you tonight  And I don't want the world to see me Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies Yhea you bleed just to know you're alive  And I don't want the world to see me Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am
