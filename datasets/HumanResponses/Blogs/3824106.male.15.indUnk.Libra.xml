      Yay, in...um...10 days I get to go to Denver for NLC(National Leadership Conference), but that isn't what I am excited about, I get 200 dollars for going and I am going to save as much as possible so that when I get back I can go on a shopping spree!  Plus while I am there I will get to go to Six Flags over Denver and Host a few meetings and boss people around!  Can't Wait!  P.S.- I am not much of a patriot, but happy independance day to you all!

      Okay this is my first post, so it will be more of a introduction into my life than anything else, you know that stuff no one wants to read!  Well I am 15 and I live with my diflicted family.  My mom is 37, preaty nice, some times, preaty mean others, but she is under stress so it is okay to be moody.  My step-dad(40 something) is grumpy and stupid and cant pay bills on time!  My step-brother who may be moving out soon, thinks taht he is posesed by 3 demons, he is 18, and a 10th grade high school drop out, and he is good for nothing!  I have a step-sister(14), who doesn't live with us, but comes over and causes problems all the time!  The rest of my family consists of my Grandfarther who lives across the street, and I love like my father, because he and my deceased grandmother raised me while my mom work 3rd shift and I went to school during the day.  Oh, my real dad, a dead beat in Missoury(I can't spell).  My other set of Grandparents are nice enough, but a completly closed minded.  My aunt, uncle and his whole family are horrible, because they blame and accuse me and my mom of everything!  I, for the most part, don't like my family, save for a few.  I can't wait untill I am 17 and can get emancipated!  Ok, onto my realy good friens: Tracy, 15, I tell her everthing and we usualy end up talking on the phone untill 12:00-1:00 in the morning:)!  She was also the first person I told I was.  Then there is Johnathan 16, a gay friend of mine the second person I told.   Now where I live: I live in a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom relatively small house, not fancy, but not a slum.  I live in a small...um...place, not a city, town, or comunity right on the Highway, near spartanburg and Cowpens.  Bible Belt.  You know down south Redneck capital of the world!  I don't like it here, because I  want to live in a big city, or at least a metropolitan area!  The bigest city near me is Spartanburg, and that doesn't have anything.   Classes:  This year I am taking English 11 Honors, Probability and Statistics(easy math and my last),  Physics CP(my last science), A+ Certification(computer repair), Computer Technology 1 and 2, and US History.  The past year was realy hard, because I had Algebra 2 Honors and Biology Honors with Mrs. Roggers, if you knew Mrs.Roggers you would know why, she is such a "not-so-nice-word-for-a-female-dog"!  But I passed the both, YAY!  Ok that is all I think!    P.S.- On the 14-17th of July I will be in Denver with FBLA(Future Bussiness Leaders of America)YAY!
