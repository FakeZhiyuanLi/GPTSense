        LOVE    Today is the first day of the rest of my life.  I try to tell myself that everyday as I watch her sleep.  It was not too long ago that I was nearly taken from her.  I am just glad that I got to do this again today.  I can do this forever you know --  watching her sleep.  Seeing her like this beside me has always been one of my greatest pleasures in life.  To hear her breath, to watch her while she is rides the crest and waves of her dreams, to feel her warmth beside me...  I smile knowing that I am the luckiest man in the world.  While I gaze upon her while she sleeps, I start remembering about the times we have spent together and wondering about the years to come.    Tonight was no different.  I remembered how we first met.  She was with her father then, she was about to enroll in one of the colleges here in the city.  I have known her family for four years prior to that moment, but that was the first time I saw her.  No, my heart did not jump out of its seat -- I was romantically involved with someone else during that time, so the thought of being with her escaped me.  Ours is not a story of love at first sight.  We did not have one of those moments were time stood still the first time we met.  It was quite casual, really.  We were introduced and that was the end of that.  Since that day, however, I gained a new friend.  At first, we talked about things that we both can relate to.  Over time we, as we learned to trust each other more, we opened our hearts to one another, and started to talk more about people and things that we cared for.  Our families, our dreams, our goals, and the love of our lives.  Back then, she had an unrequited affection to an old friend of hers.  We talked about him, and about how she felt for him.  I also told her about the girl I had been dating for two years -- and how she broke my heart.  We formed very strong bonds as the months went by... until something happened between us.  Something we both did not see coming.  I suddenly became jealous of guys that were frequentily visiting her.  She would also be angry if I did not text her in a middle of a date -- my date.  Things that we never expected to do.   I do not know what happened, but we fought like we were lovers, and then end our day with that eerie, unfamiliar silence.  I would then go to bed thinking what went wrong.  The following day, I tried to make ammends but somewhere along the way, we end up fighting again and then the awkward silence takes over.  It went on for weeks -- until it reached to a point where we decided it was best that we did not see each other for a while.  My time alone made me realize how important she was to me.  She later confided about feeling the same way too.  We did not see each other for a month, making deliberate attempts to avoid one another.  Both thinking that falling for a friend was wrong -- as we both have experienced before -- and that it would not lead us to any good.  She would just peek out of her window as I would pass by, while I would just take a glance or two when she goes out to buy lunch or dinner.  I do not remember how long that arrangement lasted, but I guess it had to happen before we could take the next step in our relationship.  We tried to keep up with our charade.  But, as many hopeless romantics know, love knows no bounds and nor could it be shackled and chained.  One day, we just decided to talk again.  It started with a smile and one hello.  Although, that awkward silence was still there, we knew that we had to give it a try.  Little by little, our conversations started flowing freely again.  This time, we both decided that if we were going to fall, then so be it.  Let it come.  And it did.  On September 16, 2001, I told her how I felt.  Amidst the constant calls from my mother to stir the Champorado... Amidst the loud music from our neighbors, professing that sad movies made her cry.... Amidst the chorus of children singing about a boy and a girl who fell down the hill...  the sweetest sound came from her mouth...  "I love you too."  On that day I knew -- it was the first day of the rest of my life.

       GRIEF   My head swirls as the world around me turns.  It hangs heavy, ready to fall.  I cannot hear my wife as she rushes to me -- the look of fear on her face.  I tried to smile, to calm her, but it was too late...  and then I saw the floor... and then nothing......  ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................   I hear the sound of her voice amidst a cacophony of chaos.  Asking me not to leave.  "I am not leaving," I tried to say... but I cannot even open my eyes to see or open my mouth to speak.  I hear her sobs in the darkness and the panic in her voice.... I feel her tears roll down my cheeks.......   ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................  ...................................................   I feel her warmth beside me.  I can feel she is sleeping now.  Finally resting.  I want to wake to console her, but my body won't let me.  I can only imagine what she's feeling.  How much I made her worry.  Was it all worth it?  Was the quest for a better pay for -- theoretically -- a better life worth all this?  Hearing her cry... feeling her pain... all for what... Fifteen grand?!  The respect of one thankless son of a bitch and his cohorts?!  Smelling her hair now, I knew, a better pay did not mean a better life.  I already had that, and I almost threw it away.  I caused her so much pain... so much pain.... I could not forgive myself for this travesty... I could only try to make ammends...  The tears started to sting in my eyes, and slowly I woke.  Seeing her huddled beside the bed, stirring at the sensation of my tears rolling over her hands.  She did not speak.  We both didn't have to.  Our tears were enough.  Our love was enough.  Amidst the controlled celebration and relieved sighs of family and doctors, I was home with the one that mattered most.  I almost forgot that she was.   I will never forget again...

       Dry Drowning   I laid there.  Trying to breath.  Trying take in as much air with every painful lungful.  My heart pounds louder than the drums of war at the siege of Minas Tirith.  My lungs feel like they are about to implode.  My head is heavy... it feels as if the world has fallen down on it.  My muscles burn and I feel it cry out every time I tried to move...  The world swirls around me like the void.   Is this death?  Is my time near?  My body feels cold and numb... I couldn't feel my limbs, let alone move the joints that connect them to the rest of my body.  I can still hear my heart pound... I can feel it wanting to tear itself away from the rest of my body as it races with shallow labored breathing...  I can feel my life draining away from my body... I can feel the darkness consume me...  And finally I fade... I give in... the void takes me and these thoughts are my last.....   ..................................  ............................  .............  .......  But I live.  And I finally get some sort of reprieve from the pain.  My limbs, though sore, feels warmth again...  my heart has slowed down from its frantic pace... my lungs have now regained it composure, and I can breathe again...  Lying there, I realized that I had been given a new chance at life... a profound experience that shows me how fragile I am... how precious my life is...  Suddenly I feel something throw itself at me from my right and lingered by my right ribcage...  Wife:  (purring) Fifteen rounds.... you are amazing... Care for one more?  Me: ...........  :'(

       For My Wife   I Miss You Incubus  To see you when I wake up is a gift I didn't think could be real... To know that you feel the same as I do is a three-fold utopian dream...  You do something to me That I can't explain... So would I be out of line If I said...  I miss you....  I see your picture, I smell your skin On the empty pillow next to mine... You have only been gone ten days and already I'm wasting away...  I know I'd see you again Whether far or soon... But I need you to know That I care....  And I miss you...   I love you with more of my heart, that none is left to protest

       Cold Summer Nights   Two days ago, my wife went home to her hometown for the holidays.  I couldn't go with her -- I had responsibilities at work -- responsibilities that I have foolishly brought upon myself in the quest for higher pay.  Our home feels empty now.  Every time I come home from work, there is no one there to greet me, to kiss me, to make everything that has gone wrong in my day disappear.  I cook a dinner for one -- I am not used to this -- somebody used to look over my shoulder while I'm doing this.  It just doesn't feel right eating in front of an empty chair.  I would give anything to hear her argue with me as to what shows to watch while I am sitting here in the den -- changing the channels every 5 seconds or so.  I would give anything to have her play with me tonight on our PS2.  I would give my life just so I could leave everything behind and fly to her.  The night deepens and I know I have to go to sleep.  Looking at the lonely bed that waits for me.  The same bed that holds the treasured memory of every moment of love we have made -- imprisoned in the walls and the ceilling that played mute witness to it all.  And I try to sleep --    knowing that I would not hear her breathing tonight...   knowing that I could not kiss her goodnight...   knowing that I wouldn't feel her skin next to mine...  Two days -- and already I'm wasting away...  (Phone Rings)  Me:  Hello?  Wife:  I love you hon... I miss you too...

       Of Lotions & Creams  (continued)  When she left me standing at the Detergents aisle in a nearby grocery, I knew not what to say.  Of course I was pissed off.  The woman was nuts.  So I continued with the grocery, making sure that I bought everything that was in my list of household consumables.  And then I went home.  I found her in front of the TV.  Apparently, what I did earned the  "I am not hearing you " punishment.  Me:  I brought us some food, I figured that we did not have time to make us some dinner...  Wife: ...  Me: You want some?  Wife: ...  Me: If you do... its at the table...  Wife: ...  Me: So, what's on?  Wife: ...  Me: Hmmm... that's a nice show... I hear that...  Wife: (Changes channels) ...  Me: Do you need me for anything? If you do...  Wife: (Give's me the dreaded evil eye and then turns back to the TV)  ...  Me: ... I'll be...  ...  ... Right...  The night ends with her not talking to me and I fell asleep.    THE FOLLOWING MORNING   I woke up with her weight pressed onto my back.  I turned to her and smiled.  She was still sleeping.  I always loved this time of day.  She was so peaceful, so silent... these are the moments that I have her all to myself.  Feeling her beside me, all nice and warm.  The light coming through small openings from the window above us allows the sun to play with the shadows resting on her face.  She was breathtaking.  God, I love this woman.  She opened her eyes and made a face.  Then she gave me a pout.  Me: Good morning.  Wife: I shouldn't be talking to you, you know?  Me: Then why are you? (smiling now)  Wife: (Turns away from my face) Hmph.  Me: (Embracing her now) I love you wife.  Wife: ...  Me: I do not see why you go through all the trouble for such things?  Wife: Don't you get it, I want to be beautiful for you.  Me: (Slowly turning her over to face me) You already are.  If you had only the eyes to see what I see.  Wife: You always had a way with words... don't you patronize me mister...  Me: (Kisses her on the forehead) I'm not... I mean it... you know that... But if it makes you feel better, I did buy you some lotion, its with the...  Wife: I know... (smiles)  The day went without incident, she was finally appeased and everything went back to normal.  The following day, I got up early for work.  I rushed through the motions of my bath... fearing that I would be late.  When I was done she stood outside of our bathroom -- lotion in hand.  Me: What are you doing?  Wife:  (Starts to apply the lotion on me) I'm showing you the wonders of the lotion for the body.  That way, I will no longer have to explain its importance..  Me: Hon, I'm going to be late -- and it feels greasy --  Wife: (Continues to apply lotion)...  Me: Hon... what the... not there...  (Strange warm sensation starts to engulf me...)  Me:  Mmmmmmmmmmm... Lotion.........

       Of Lotions and Creams   I don't know.  Women get exceptionally crazy when it comes to their looks.  Take my better half, for example, we were out buying our groceries one night.  She said that she wanted to buy a bottle of lotion.  No problem there, I thought.  Me: "Sure Hon, we can swing by that aisle later -- after we get all the things that we  really  need for the week."  Wife: "What are you trying to say?"  Me: "Nothing.  I just said we should buy what we need first and what we want second."  Wife: "No.   What were you trying to say?   Are you saying that my needs are not as important as yours?"  Me: "No.  I did not say that, I just --"  Wife: "Are you telling me that I am not important?"  Me: "What!?"  Wife: "Do I go complaining when you need to play with that PS2 of yours?"  Me: "Wait, wait -- Why are you upset?  And what is it with you and my PS2?"  Wife: "Is it so wrong if I make myself beautiful for you?  Is it so wrong that I want to feel good about myself?"  Me:  "Baby, you don't need to be any more beautiful than you already are.  I love you.  You couldn't be more beautiful even if you tried?"  Wife: "ARE YOU CALLING ME VAIN!?"  Me: "What!?"  Wife: "You are so insensitive!!!"  Me: "What the.. !?"  Wife: "Ugh!!"   She then walks out on me.  I stood there in the grocery looking really dumbfounded and feeling really stupid...  (to be continued)

       Questions   "Will you still love me when were old and gray? When I start questioning our come-what-mays?"  She asked me out of the blue.  I looked at her and gave her a puzzled look.  "You know... I'm not the sanest woman in the planet.  What if my behavior becomes too unbearable? What if I won't make a good mother? What if over the course of our marriage, I would become like my mother -- a hopeless nagger -- will you still love me then?"  "What if I somehow become annoying, or -- you know -- could you just say something?  Anything?"  I just smiled.  I continued to do the dishes while she stood there behind me.  "Hon, what if I become too much of a burden for you... what if... you'll grow tired of me -- of this -- of us?"  Sometimes, I ask myself the same questions.  Will she love me tomorrow? Will she still be there?  But I have never asked her my share of questions.  Until tonight.  "Niamh, if I were to ask you the same questions, how would you answer them?"  I turned to her now, as I said this, towelling the plates dry.  I looked at her tenderly, and I tried to understand where these fears were coming from.  "Baby, our marriage is not just about you surviving me or me surviving you -- it's about us. It's about how much of our individual natures are we willing to compromise.  It's about how much we care for each other.  I can't answer your questions here and now, as much as you can't truthfully answer mine.  These questions can only be answered as the days, weeks, months and years go by.  It's not going to be an easy road, but if we help each other... I'm sure we will make it... We just need to have faith in each other.  There is no point in fearing that which we do not know."  She took the last plate from my hand and placed it on the tray.   "There is one thing I do know.  I don't want to lose you..."   My heart warmed as she walked up to me and held me tight.  "Nor I... Remember our vows: I love you, and I shall love only you.  Trust that my heart will remain true, trust that I will never willfully hurt you, trust that even as the world conspire against us..."  She gently placed her fingers over my mouth,  "... I would still choose to be with you.  For you are my husband and I am your wife.  And I have known no other refuge than our love."

       Metal Slug   It was starting to rain... but our attack on the enemy base was in its final stages.  We can't give up now.  My wife was armed with a shotgun and I had an M-16 rifle in hand.  We were three grenades short of a dozen, but I think it will get the job done.  Bullets were flying everywhere, the enemy somehow knew we were coming.  Our panzer division was totally wiped out... our enemies outnumbered us a hundred to one... we were so close... we couldn't give up now...  My wife threw four grenades to clear our path.  I took point while she trailed behind me, covering my back.  Our objective was to destroy the enemy base at all cost... and we are freedom's last hope...  The body count numbered in the hundreds as we pushed on to our path...  four grenades... would that be enough?  Doesn't matter now -- there's no turning back...  I strafed a clear path for her, only to watch her get blown to bits when she stepped on a landmine...  "Nooooooooooooooo!!!" I cried, my fury now overflows....  I rushed the enemies head on...... they had hell to pay...  As the last hordes of resistance came pouring out of the gate like the floodgates of a dam, I knew death was certain... but I will not die without a fight...  And everything went blank...  "Hon, nganong imo man gipawng ang TV?"  "Ah, samok patay na ko..."  "Naa pa man ko 'Continue'.."  "Ako wala naman! Hmph, it's a stupid game anyway!  Balik ta duwa kanang naa na ka'y cheats para di na ko mamatay..."  I sat there stumped...  "Tara na mangatulog na, sige ka, dili ka kapabuto nang imong shotgun ron..."  It's hard to argue with a general.

       In Sickness and In Health...    Anger.   That's what I see in her eyes as she cleans our little home.  I see it with every move she makes.  She has never kept her emotions from me, nor would I want her to.  She glares at me everytime she hears me wheezing, struggling to hold back the things she wants to say.   I smiled.   Sitting in my little corner with a mug of medicinal green tea in hand, I can feel her muscles tighten everytime I take in every labored breath of air.  She loves me, I know that.  Although she did not say anything, I know that she is upset because I am sick, yet again.  I know she worries about me, and she is upset because she is afraid.   Fear.   I can still remember her voice that day.  I can vividly recall her plea, asking me not to leave.  I can still taste her tears, I can still hear her sobs.  She is upset because everytime I get sick, she fears that it will bring me closer to a place where she could not follow.  I got up and walked slowly behind her, and then embraced her tightly.  "Hon, have you finished your tea?"  Her voice was tense and restrained.  "You don't have to worry about me, you know... this is just a minor "glitch" that's all..."  "How many times have you fallen ill this month?  Am I the only one counting here?"  She blurted, finally.  "Ssshhh... it's okay," I held her firmly this time. "I'm fine, I promise, everything's going to be alright, you'll see.."  She was crying now, "Do you know how hard this is for me?  Seeing you weak and nearly lifeless?"  "Me? Lifeless?"  I said this while I did my best Hulk Hogan impression which ended looking like a silverback gorilla in heat...  She laughed and crashed into my arms...  "You're hopeless..."  "No, I am anything but hopeless.  I have you."   And knowing that gives me more than enough reason to live.

       REASONS   This is an e-mail I sent to my wife last year.  Just after being at the receiving end of my parents' violent reaction to our marriage.    As to why I think you are beautiful:  To love someone means to see her as God sees her   As to why I married you:  When you realize that you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.   As to why I still go back to you:  "Le coeur a ses raisons, Que la raison ne connait point." The heart has its reasons, Whereof reason knows nothing  To live is like to love - all reason is against it, and all healthy instinct for it   As to why I do not listen to what others think:  Follow your own heart, Not others.   As to why I accept your kind of love:  No one has ever loved anyone the way everyone wants to be loved   As to why I would never leave you:  For we lose not only by death, But also by leaving and being left, By changing and letting go and moving on.   As to why I miss you:  Every night I imagine touching your face, but nothing is there except empty space. My dreams are filled with visions of eternal bliss, sealed by your tender and heavenly kiss. I awake from my dreams, yearning to hold you near, searching but not finding bringing me to tears. I lie there thinking about how you showed me love, making me wonder if you were sent from heaven above. I fall asleep knowing that you are in my mind and my heart, for love is eternal and we will never be apart   As to why I say we are meant to be:   True love cannot be found where it truly does not exist, Nor can it be hidden where it truly does   As to why we sacrifice the way we do for each other:  There is no work in matters of love -- only exertions of great joy.   As to why I still love you and why I love you this much:  I love thee, I love but thee With a love that shall not die Till the sun grows cold And the stars grow old.  So dear I love thee that with thee, All deaths I could endure. Without thee, I live no life.  I have loved to the point of madness; That which is called madness, That which to me, Is the only sensible way to love   My dearest Niamh, I know that my family has caused you much pain.  I am sorry.  I never intended for any of that to happen.  But know this, they have been trying to break us apart since "we" began, and they have not succeeded.  They will never succeed.  Not now, not ever.  I belong to you, and if being excommunicated from my family is the price I pay for wanting to spend the rest of my life with you -- to grow old with you, to build a family with you -- then I will gladly pay it.  After a lifetime of hardships, you have given me love and happiness, and I will be damned before they take that away from me.  Remember only this: "I love you with more of my heart, that none is left to protest."  Our love is true.  That is all that matters

       Niamh's Songs: Everything   Niamh, as I fondly call my wife (means heaven in old Celtic languages), says that this song reminds her of me, more than anything.  She tells me that she might as well have written "Everything" herself because it captures the sense of wonderment, appreciation, and love that she feels for me and for the love I have given and continue to give -- everyday, and every minute since "we" began.    Everything Alanis     I can be an asshole of the grandest kind  I can withhold like it's going out of style  I can be the moodiest baby  And you've never met anyone  As negative as I am sometimes   I am the wisest woman you've ever met  I'm the kindest soul with whom you've connected  I have the bravest heart that you've ever seen  And you've never met anyone  As positive as I am sometimes   You see everything  You see every part  You see all my light  And you love my dark  You dig everything  Of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can't relate  And you're still here   I blame everyone else, not my own partaking  My passive aggressiveness can be devastating  I'm terrified and mistrusting  And you've never met anyone who's closed down as I am sometimes   You see everything  You see every part  You see all my light  And you love my dark  You dig everything  Of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can't relate  And you're still here   What I resist, persists, and speaks louder than I know  What I resist, you love, no matter how low or high I go   I am the funniest woman that you've ever known  I am the dullest woman that you've ever known  I am the most gorgeous woman that you've ever known  And you've never met anyone as everything as I am sometimes   You see everything  You see every part  You see all my light  And you love my dark  You dig everything  Of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can't relate   And you're still here  And you're still here  And you're still here

       Songs of Our Life: Absence of Fear    If there ever was one song that defined my relationship with my wife, it's this one.  She sang this to me as her way of saying "Yes" when I popped the big question over a year ago.  This is also the song that I sang to her after we were wed, while we were waiting for the boat to take us back to Cebu.    Absence of Fear   Jewel Kilcher    Inside my skin There is this space It twists and turns It bleeds and aches Inside my heart There's an empty room It's waiting for lightning It's waiting for you  I am wanting and I am needing you To be here Inside the absence Of fear  Muscle and sinew Velvet and stone This vessel is haunted It creaks and moans My bones call to you In a separate skin I'll make myself translucent To let you in  I am wanting and I am needing you To be here Inside the absence Of fear  There is the splendor of this Secret inside of me And it knows that you're no stranger You're my gravity My hands will adore you through all darkness And they will lay you out in moonlight And reinvent your name  I am wanting and I am needing you To be here I need you near Inside the absence Of fear

       Sanctuary   I was tired as hell.  It was another godawful day at the Creek.  Although, my friends at the office certainly help lighten the mood, but being the man I am, I just cannot stand being in the same building with those I abhor.  It sickens me to depths of my being.  I must take in the bad with the good.  I try to tell myself.  But the "bad" has certainly outweighed the "good" in the office.  Coming home is such a relief.  My wife always finds a way to take away all that pain and she never fails to make me smile.  I hear her singing in the bathroom, maybe I should sneak in... naah... it would scare her half to death... she does not know I'm in yet.  My dogs were sleeping, as they always do before dinner.  The oldest of the lot, Gore, woke up and came to greet me.  Hearing the elder dog's barking and whining, Shakti and her five puppies, (Uno, Salva, Sappy, Chippy & Dee) woke up and ran to my direction.  They were all over me... licking my face... gnawing at my slippers... it was good to be among those you can trust...  Sorrounded by wagging tails, warm tounges and wet noses, its so hard not be happy.  My wife, got out of the bathroom, still wet and draped in my towel.  I guess all the ruckus with the dogs caught her attention.  She smiled at me... and asked me how my day was...  I just made a funny face and she understood...  She went back in the bathroom and continued with her bath...  I took off my soiled clothes and followed her to the bathroom... leaving the dogs behind... She saw me come in and turned to welcome me in her arms and pulled me in the bath with her... to be greeted by the relaxing sensation of water running down my body from the make-shift shower overhead...  I closed my eyes for a moment... to enjoy the feeling of her warmth... then I opened it... only to lose myself in her gaze....  Then............  we kissed........  And everything in my world was made right.....  Finally, I'm home..........

       WTF!   It was a normal Sunday afternoon.  We were lying in bed watching Cartoon Network reruns of The Roadrunner Show.  We spend many afternoons like this... lying prone on the bed, sipping iced tea, watching DVD's or shows on TV.  However, I had a feeling that this was going to be a different day... a disturbingly different day in the life of Joe.  In the middle of watching Road Runner (fastus foodus) run circles around Wily Coyote (canis hungrius) my wife (dominatrix supremus) climbed up my back.  I (confusa husbandi) paid no mind to it -- this was not the first time she did that -- I know she enjoyed watching TV from that angle.  Then she started to kiss me.  Passionately.  I went "Whoah!"  I must have done something right to deserve this, or so I thought.   I wanted to turn on my back so that I could kiss back but she told me not to.  She asked me not to ruin it for her.  So I let her do her thing (actually, I didn't mind -- not one bit... simply put, I was enjoying whatever it was she was planning).  Then the strangest thing happened.  She started... umm... er... humping me...  At first I thought she just had trouble moving up... but as the humps became more regular and rhythmical, my skin started to crawl...  Me: "What in the name of all that is holy are you doing!?"  Wife: "Hon... sige na karon lang..."  Me: "Ngano man intawn ka..."  Wife: "Sige na... let's pretend we are in prison and you are..."  Me: "TAYM SA!!! Are you making me your bitch!!"  Now I know how a new inmate feels.   "Wag po kuya...."

      Today I would like to share the songs that brought me out of the darkness that was once my life.  As corny as it sounds, for every phase in my life, there seemed to be songs that best described how I felt and these song paint a vivid description of the emotions that were boiling under my skin.  The following songs are special.  They came at a time when I needed them most.  These songs helped my journey home to the Father, and in turn, the journey home to my true self.  You might be wondering why I am placing these songs in a blog intended for my better half.  Simply put, if I had not found my way back, I wouldn't be the man I am today and I would not have found my wife.  :)    HOME   THINKING BACK WHEN WE FIRST MET I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID YOU SAID YOU'D NEVER LEAVE ME I LET GO OF YOUR HAND BUILT MY CASTLE IN THE SAND BUT NOW I'M REACHIN' OUT AGAIN AND I'M NOT LETTING GO TILL YOU HOLD ME MOLD ME SOMETIMES I FEEL SO ALL ALONE SEE I GOTTA FIND MY WAY BACK HOME SO WHY DON'T YOU SHAPE ME MAKE ME WASH ME WHITER THAN THE SNOW I GOTTA FIND MY WAY BACK HOME  MASTER UPON MY KNEES I PRAY I JUST WANT TO BE THE CLAY PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME PLACE MY LIFE IN YOUR HANDS LORD I KNOW I'M JUST A MAN I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THIS TIME I'M NOT LETTING GO TILL YOU  ANOINT ME APPOINT ME SOMETIMES I FEEL SO ALL ALONE SEE I GOTTA FIND MY WAY BACK HOME SO WHY DON'T YOU CHASTISE ME BAPTIZE ME WASH ME WHITER THAN THE SNOW I GOTTA FIND MY WAY  'CAUSE I'M LOST AND ALONE I'VE BEEN WANDERING LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW HUMBLY I SEARCH FOR YOU AND I'M NOT GONNA REST TILL YOU  CHOOSE ME USE ME SOMETIMES I FEEL SO ALL ALONE I'M ON MY WAY BACK HOME SO WHY DON'T YOU DIRECT ME BLESS ME WASH ME WHITER THAN THE SNOW I'M ON MY WAY BACK HOME   GAYA NG DATI    DATI-RATI LAMAN NG PUSO MO AY ANG PANGALAN KO LAGI AKO SA ISIP MO DATI-RATI INAAWITAN PA, LABI AY MAY NGITI, MGA MATA'Y NAGNININGNING  NGUNIT NGAYON NAGBAGO KA  NASAAN NA ANG INIT NG PAGSINTA PANGAKO MO'Y HINDI MAGWAWAKAS  DI BA'T NOON SAMYO NG BULAKLAK AT IHIP NG HANGIN  AY KAPANSIN-PANSIN DI BA'T NOON TAKBO NG ORAS AY DI MO NAPAPANSIN LAGING NAGLALAMBING NGUNIT NGAYON NAGLAHO NA SIGLA'T TAMIS NG 'YONG PAGSINTA PAGMAMAHAL KO BA'Y KAILANGAN PA?

       The Madness of it All   "Kinsa man ning nag-text?!"  She asked me, with eyes burning through my soul.  "Unsa ba?"  I asked, confused over her sudden outburst.  "Kinsa ning nagtext nimo?!"  She was irate.  Very, irate.  In a scale of one to ten, she would have to be a 9.4 right about now.  "Let me see that..." I grabbed the phone from her.  The very phone she bought as a surprise for me -- bought with my own money, I should point out (Which reminds me, I should never leave that much money inside the house ever again, she is bound to find it, no matter how I try to hide it).  The message said:   Niinom na ka sa imong tambal? Nikaon na ka?  Ayaw pagpabaya sa imong kaugilongon, last ka niari, mura man ka ug nagluya.   I looked at the number, it was...  Then I got choked up.. the message was so loving, it was something I never expected from that person.  "Tan-awa, lipay kaayo ka! Kinsa man nang bayhana!?" Her voice was trembling now, she was really upset.  Tears started to form around her eyes.  Looking at her, I started to laugh.  She was jealous, and somehow, in some weird way, it made me feel good.  "Tawagan bi!!" She snorted as she took the phone from me.  I just stood there, waiting for perhaps one of the funnier moments in our relationship.  "Hello!  Hello?  Kinsa n..  O, o  ikaw diay ni Pa... storya ka niya?  o Pa, nangaon na mi, o,  o"  And then she pressed cancel.  She was blushing now.  It was a sight for sore eyes.  "Sorry 'ny (it's one of the gazillion ways we call each other... its short for 'Hunny')", she said.  I just held her tight... lauging to myself... and feeling good because my father checked up on me.  A very rare occurence in my life.  "Pero, ako lang ang magdala sa phone karon ug ugma, basin pa diay ug naay mo text."  Toink

       And Then There Was One   Ronald Reagan.  Never mind that I hated the guy.  Never mind that he played a big part in the prostitution of the Philippines back in the Marcos years, by being a staunch supporter of the dictator.  Never mind that I was missing a big chunk of animated shows because my wife insisted on watching his funeral somewhere overlooking the Pacific Ocean, near the Ronald Reagan National Library.  Never mind the irony of naming a building to hold the treausures of knowledge and history to someone who, at the end of his life, could not even remember his wife.  I sat there with my wife.  Watching everything unfold at a relatively sleepy pace (well, it was a funeral).  Until something my wife calls "the moment" happened.  The Marine pall bearers have finished folding the American Flag and the Captain of the USS Ronald Reagan, knelt on one knee to offer the flag to former first lady, Mrs. Nancy Reagan.  She then went to his side.  I say this as if he was alive because that was how Nancy moved.  She moved as if she saw her husband their, and yet her eyes told me that she knew he was inside the coffin.  It was a very eerie moment at first, but then I understood.  She then spoke to him.  And kissed the coffin.  Stroked its surface like it was his hand.  She did not want to leave him.  Nor did she want to be left behind.  Her children and the family doctor consoled her, as tears were gently rolling down her face.  I was choked up and tears started to form around my eyes.  My wife ran to our bed and started crying.  Crying her heart out.  I had to stay.  Though I did not want to.  But I had to.  Out of respect for this woman who spent a lifetime with the love of her life.  Today she was just a wife.  Sending her husband home.  And I understood.  This was closer to home for Juvee than it was for me.  Hearing her cry, I knew that she was not only crying for Nancy, but she was also fearing for me, for us, for her.  She knew that someday one of us will be left behind.  And we both know that it will most likely be her.  And she will have to send me home.  We rocked each other to sleep, not thinking of that moment, but knowing that it will come.

       First Time   "Kabalo ka hon? Dili man ikaw akong first."  I heard her say while we were laying in our love nest.  I was holding her in my arms, her legs wrapped around me.  I love the warmth of her breath on my chest, and the feel of her sweat on my body.  She always gets like this.  She always wants to make sure if I would still love her if she reveals something that might perhaps shock me or make me doubt of her integrity and dignity as a person.  I have heard similar questions about a million times already.  Stories that she had a baby before, that her youngest brother is in fact her son that was adopted by her parents.  I just laugh them off.  She always wants to be affirmed that I would love her no matter what.  "Hoy naminaw ka?"  She asked again.  I sighed and tried looking out of our small window.  "Hon, ngano man ka?"  She sounded troubled now.  "Wala, I just wondered if it was the full moon.  Nisuol na man sad gud ka."  She chuckled and hit me in the ribs.  The full moon is our little joke.  We almost always have our major fights either on the full moon or just before her period arrives.  She acts strangely during those times.  She keeps asking crazy questions, creating bizzare scenarios, and/or throws a tantrum.  Since it was two day after her monthly period, I knew that it was not the case.  It had to be the moon.  "Serious baya ko."  Despite this, I saw a hint of smile on her face.  "Dili lagi si Thanos ang naka-una nako."  (Slayer's Note:  Butch has his 'Berto'; Martin has his 'Walrus'; I have my 'Thanos')  I looked at her, and somehow the expression of her face -- um... er... -- "inspired" me and Thanos...  "Dili bitaw."  She gave me a puzzled look.  "Mas nakauna man akong middle finger ug ang akong dila didto."  She smiled and pinched me as she felt the growing warmth near her belly.

       CONTROL   I tried to keep the facade... hold it up as long as I can. I tried what my wife told me... to rise above and beyond myself... To be stronger than the anger that burns inside... To be more adamant than the hatred that slowly poisons my soul...  I tried...   And I failed.    I tried to smile whenever the bastard was around... I tried to mask the pain I have inside... I tried to forget how he and his cohorts nearly killed me with their arrogant, insensitivity and irresponsible management of human resource -- namely, me...  I tried... Lord knows I tried...   And I failed...   All I see is red.... All I taste is blood... His blood on my hands after I crushed his head on the concrete wall.. All I hear is their screams right after I inviscerate them and leave their entrails to hang from the rest of their bodies...  This hatred boils over to the point of no return and I cannot pretend anymore.  I cannot wear masks... I have never liked masks in the first place...  One cannot truly stand to be a man if he seeks the shelter of his masks...  I am not a hypocrite...  I am not one of them...  I will never be one of them...  I am anger and hatred personified... the very aspect of Shiva on earth...  I am rage...  I am bloodlust...  I am the apocalypse within each and every soul...  I am The Slayer...    But I am also a husband... I have someone who waits for me... I have someone who trusts in me... I have someone who loves me...  I have to rise above it all...  Not for my sake...  But for my little slice of heaven back home...   Once again I will try...    But I will smile no more............

       UTOPIA   My wife sent me this piece that she found at their library.  She says it speaks a lot about how we relate to each other, and how we have somehow managed to reach our own 'utopia', our own 'nirvana.'   Utopia  we'd gather around all in a room fasten our belts engage in dialogue  we'd all slow down rest without guilt not lie without fear disagree sans judgement  we would stay and respond and expand and include and allow and forgive and enjoy and evolve and discern and inquire and accept and admit and divulge and open and reach out and speak up  This is utopia this is my utopia This is my ideal my end in sight Utopia this is my utopia This is my nirvana My ultimate  we'd open our arms we'd all jump in we'd all coast down into safety nets  we would share and listen and support and welcome be propelled by passion not invest in outcomes we would breathe and be charmed and amused by difference be gentle and make room for every emotion  we'd provide forums we'd all speak out we'd all be heard we'd all feel seen  we'd rise post-obstacle more defined more grateful we would heal be humbled and be unstoppable we'd hold close and let go and know when to do which we'd release and disarm and stand up and feel safe   this is utopia this is my utopia  this is my ideal my end in sight utopia this is my utopia this is my nirvana my ultimate

       ORDINARY DAYS   I have not written anything in a while.  One might ask whether our married life has suddenly run out of 'highlights' (or 'lowlights', if you prefer) or whether we have succumbed to that awful sense of familiarity that robs married couples of their passions and desires.  No, that is not the case.  The passion is still there.  And the desire is still there.  Then why nothing?  Why?  It's because we have learned to enjoy 'ordinary days' together.  Have you seen a movie lately?  You know a regular movie...  You notice how the sequence of scenes are edited to tell the whole story?  Have you ever wondered what happened in between those scenes? You know, the ones that are not shown on the movie... have you ever wondered how they went about?  That's where we are right now.  For me, these are the moments that define a marriage.  Sure, the big budget production scenes in your life are the ones that catches the attention of many people.  Sure these moments have the power to make or brake a marriage.  But, its the moments that are often forgotten that makes a marriage worthwhile.  For us, its the nightly walks we take around the Fuente Oval.  Hand in hand, we share the night away as we talk about anything and everything that comes to mind.  She talks about School and life at MetroBank, or how she spent her childhood in Manila and in Leyte.  I talk about my day at work or things I have read or learned in the course of the day or the things I have learned in the course of my short existence.  And after we grow weary from walking, we can choose to sit in one of the many benches around the Fuente Oval, and continue to talk or choose to go home.  We often get criticized by friends and family, as to why we chose Fuente.  Berating us for staying where the househelps and drivers choose to date.  I just laugh it off and actually feel sorry for the person.  They have not realized a fundamental lesson in life:   Its the company that makes everything worthwhile.   For us, its never the location or the amount of money we spend.  For as long as we have each other we can endure anything.  If we do not go out to walk, we can spend time together at home.  I sometimes teach her how to cook or we can choose to spar.  We rarely watch Television, so most of our home time is spent reading books and sharing what we have read.  The point is, we don't have to do anything to enjoy each others company.  We don't have to have an 'exciting' event to truly enjoy the time we spend together.  That's where most married couples fail. Because they are in constant search for excitement in their lives.  And then they forget or lose sight of the reasons why they got married in the first place.  I have never forgotten my reasons:   I could not see myself going through life without you.  I want to spend the rest of my life -- from every waking moment and even in the slumber of dreams -- with the one who has given me much joy and contentment.  You.  I love you Juvee.   Would I trade what I have for a chance at living an exciting life?  Never.  I could never give up these ordinary days.
