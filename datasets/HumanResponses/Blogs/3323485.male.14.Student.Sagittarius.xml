      What do other people see me as? A Statistic? An automated prgramming/webmastering/making an ass of himself machine? Why not? thats really all I am. When you look through the blog listiogs, and you see Peter Ooms' Weblog, did you click on me because you liekd the name?   ive just noticed something...ive had no effect on anything. if i was never born, the only differences would be a couple of schoolbooka and this blog wouldnt be here. holy s**t now I really am depressed. im just off to do some homework. might aswell kill myself for all the dofference it would make to everyone elses life.

      In case you havent guessed, i hate year eihts. they think theyre so smart with their 'no longer the smallest guy' attitude. it just gets me pissed off. I was walking around, minding my own buisiness, and a bunch of 4+ year 8s appeared from nowhere and started pissing about with me. All I did was call one of them a 'stupid git' and it got dirty. I wont go into the details, bot there was 4+ of them, 1 of me and they were bigger, so you can guess the rest. Just before it got bad, two teachers appeared from nowhere.   I never thought I would  ever  hear myself say this, but thank god for teachers!

      Hello World Today we did the 1500m boys trials. I think i did $h17. My time, if anhybody wants it, is 7 mins 49 secs. I had another of those thoughts today. If I were to die, suddenly now, would people remember me, and if yes, what as. Would they remember me as "that little ba$+ard who gave me the finger" ot "a cool goy who f****d it up". -Well, partof me today wanted to commit suicide.   Holy s**t! Ive just realised the implications of what I just said. HJeres me, a 12-year-old, sitting here, chewing some plastic, seriously concidering  suicide !  Well, just if I do snuff it today, can you please remember one thing. Please...   For centuries, the world has been, and will continue to be rigged with people both willing and able to exploit the ignorant. Someday, nobody knows when, all the ignorant who have been scammed willl rise up and defeat theese vast bodies. The rebels will suceed and life will be a fair thing. Until...    Ignorance Is Weakness  (c)2004 Peter W. Ooms

      Dont you just  hate  it when you know you are right, and someone persistant keeps on contradicting you! I will say it now and say it clear. In the Matrix, Neo takes the RED pill to exit the matrix. I was arguing about this with Paul one day, and, along came Dominic and, because he fancies Paul, agreed with him. HE'S NEVER EVEN SEEN THE F**KING MATRIX!!!!!!!! This really makes my blood boil. If I were prime Minister, I would outlaw homosexuality, outlaw this qstupid theory everyones got. I will make my views clear...  A GOOD WINNER IS BULLS**T. AS IS A GOOD LOSER. PEOPLE WIN THINGS SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE THE P**S FROMN THE OTHER TEAM. WE WON WE WON WE WON. BAD LOSERS!

      Well Ive just finished my homework and it has taken me just under four hours. I woke up at 11:00 AM GMT and have just finished it now...at 3:19 GMT. I hate homework. Why? It reminds me of school. Also, it is a tedious wase of time on pointless busy work.  If there are any teachers reading this, DOWN WITH HOMEWORK!!! I think,on a none-uniform day, I will come to school in a t-shirt that says DOWN WITH HOMEWORK! That should get 'em!! Well, Ive got to write my PowerPoint Presentation to a CD-R so if you dont mind?...

      umm...Im hard pushed to find anything interesting to say about today. Mums still doing her stuff fow work, im still left tidying my room and all that crap.   No new E-Mail Messages. As Ever, no normal humans need/want/can be arsed to communicate with me. Cant say I blame them...im always a bore and a sadass. Nothing new or interesting. Always going on about space and computers and all that f**king s**t. I wonder...if I were to drop dead right now, would people remember me...if yes, what as... I'll think about that one and reply as soon as another insignificant thought enters my head.   Its one of 'em days, i'm afraid.

You can have up to four virtual desktops on any one machine...and best of all...ITS FREE!!!!!  For more info, see http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp .   It only works with Windows XP

Apparently: my true love has discovered she loves me yesterday at midnight and something good will hapen to me between 2.00 and 4.00 today. Well, IT DID  Though its got nothing to do with relationships  shall I tell you anyway? OK,. then    SCHOOL ENDED!!!    and its friday today! That means my first weekend blogging.  Isnt it funny that today was hilariously boring and yet I have a lot to say?  Life is Wierd.  t . h . e . . . t . r . t . h . . . i s . . . o . u . t . . . t . h . e . r . e . . . . . .

      I am just here to live out my life, and enjoy as much of it as possible. If that means influencing other peoples, then so be it. What's more, if anyone has a problem with that, they can stick it right up their ****.

        "Sometimes I wonder if I am the only sane person in the world. Then I look at my friends and realise that I must be or the world is doomed."   ( me, this morning )  Today, I will make my views clear about Britain jouning the EU:  NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!  It will cost us Â£20,000,000 a  YEAR  travelling betweel brusells and Hamberg alone! Then theres all the jobs that will be lost, and most strongly,   the  POSSIBLE  increace in crime . Notice the word possible. I am not condemming anybody, just saying that the possibility is there. With any group of any size, there will always be a few 'bad apples'.  and i bought a keyring yoday for fifty pence

      hi.   i am peter, your average 12-year-old, bored stiff, hates hwk, all that s**t. by the way, i will try not to sware here, but this is where i will let off my raw thoughts, so i may let it slip a few times. i apologise in advance for any 'slips of the toung'.  well, today is the 12th of may. 2004. done homework, etc, listening 2 music, generally p**sing about  theres some crap in the news about some bloke who got kidnapped in iraq and beheaded on a live webcam. idiot. anyone knows that with terrorism nowhere is safe, so he only goes to the source and gets killed. dont get me wrong, im not saying it was a good thing, i even feel a bit sorry for him, but i mean he was asking for trouble going to iraq at a time like this.  well, gotta go for now. bye

      Well, i've just come back from a 5-day school trip to france. Ben thought there was a ghost in our room. There was something wierd in our room-maybe a ghost but we shouldn't tamper with what we dont understand. The food was also a bit $h&#161;+ but apart from that it was OK. Gotta go because im txting this blog in. See you!

      Hi, me again  (well, its not exactly likely to be anybody else, is it?)  I know and apologise for not having posted in a while. But. Today, I feel I have to.  Well, ive been questioning my will to live oday. I mean, it could be a lot worse...but also a lot better. But, then, ive got stuff to look foreawd to...drinking...driving...girls...  Or, perhaps, make somebody  like  me for a change.  I mean, theres Paul, but he is always talking about 'world domination' schemes that never get off the ground. He thinks like a buisinessman, but this isnt neccessarily a good thing when trying to have a casual conversation :-D(joke, paul if you read this dont take it the wrong way):-D. Then theres Ben and Adam. Okay, but very very very annoying. Dominic and Jhonny really secerately hate me, they just pretend to like me because paul likes me and they want paul to like them and...you can guess the rest.  On a different subject, I got really close to having my first real girlfriend. Not a prank, a joke or a ten-second stitch-up as I have had in the past, but a real girlfriend. Well, that went down the plughole like most other things in my life which is, in the words of CM Burns (off the Simpsons) "Doing that thing again". She was acting wierd for a while...and so was I for that matter. I knew that Chalkstone was going to tell her I fancied her (just for the record, I DO but I like to keep it a secret because I am absolutely terrified of peoples reaction) so I told Paul I 'had to do domething' and just went all break and lunch...wandering...like a lost soul...thinking...getting shouted at and things thrown at me...  (apologies if I am making anybody feel depressed, but it is your life, your responsibility, no body forced you to read this and so its all your fault. Sorry, but it is.  and dont come crying to me, okay buster?)  So, thats how the day went. In summary: -one millimeter away from my first kiss -one millimeter away from my first (i think) suicidal death -one millimeter away from getting a detention -one millimeter away from my first girlfriend Its actually been quite a millimeter sorta day. 5 millimeters away from...what? a totally different day? a totally different life? a totally different death? Who knows.   I hate days like theese. 0.5 cm away from...................what? (isnt it wierd that thursdays are the ONE days in my timetable where I dont get a maths lesson and I think about millimeters more today (a thursday) then than any other day?  I wonder if I were to drop dead now, would people remembver me? If yes, what as? an idiot? a wierdo? a sadass? a pessimist?   Well, until next time,  bye...   P.S. If you think that is depressing, you should see  urlLink THIS POST !  PPS: Change of plan: I am no longer comitting suicide.

      Animal rights campaignes have it all wrong. First off, if one of their relatives gets cancer or something, they will change their their tune. Next, they fail to realise that animal testing is highly regulated and the government will stop any abusers. Lastly, just think. Only 86% of animals actually die. And, just think how many animals are saved by theese medicnes after they are releaced to the hospitals and vets. Common sense, if you ask me.
