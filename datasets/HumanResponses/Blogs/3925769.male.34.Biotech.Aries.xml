           &nbsp;  WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Spanky, a  clown with the renowned Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, has  been arrested on charges stemming from a child pornography investigation, law  enforcement officials said Tuesday.   Spanky, whose real name is Thomas Allen Riccio, 23, of Jacksonville, Florida,  made an initial state court appearance Monday in Fayetteville, North Carolina,  where he was traveling with the circus, the officials said.   He faces 10 counts of third degree sexual exploitation of a minor.   The arrest Friday was the latest in an ongoing international probe of  subscribers to a child pornography Web site that was shut down in an  international raid last July.   U.S. Customs agents leading the investigation worked with North Carolina  authorities in making the arrest, officials said.   Teachers, camp counselors and others with access to children have been high  on the priority list for customs officials.   Agents have arrested hundreds of people in recent months, after obtaining  tens of thousands of names from a credit card billing company allegedly involved  in handling payments for Internet porn sites.   The investigation, dubbed Operation Predator, linked Riccio to a company in  Belarus that provided the billing services for more than 50 child porn Web sites  worldwide, officials said.   In announcing the arrest, the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement  said that when agents searched Riccio's computer, they discovered "thousands of  images, many of which involve prepubescent children engaged in various sexual  and lewd acts."   "This man's profession as Spanky the clown brought him into contact with  hundreds of families," said agent Albert Fitchett Jr. in Wilmington, North  Carolina.   "Behind the clown nose, however, this man appears to have been supporting an  industry that trades in the exploitation of children."       http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/05/25/clown.porn.charges/

              July 20, 2004  ROGERSVILLE (AP) -- Authorities in Hawkins County say four guys made a couple of beer runs late on July 15th. Problem is, they're jail inmates.   Ridgy Dean Coleman, Jimmy Joe Stapleton, David Wayne Blizzard and David Allen Hopkins are all charged with escape and bringing intoxicants into the jail in Rogersville.       Sheriff Warren Rimer says two of the inmates got out through a fire exit, propped open the door with a Bible, then cut a hole in a fence and walked to a nearby market to buy beer.       Then, they came back.       When the beer was gone, Rimer says the other two went out for more, walking  to a different market.       They came back, too.       The sheriff says the door lock detection system malfunctioned, leading jailers to believe all doors in the cell block were locked.       Corrections officers found a lot of empty beer cans and several full ones.          Copyright 2004 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

             Thu 22 July, 2004 08:29                                    By Cynthia Littleton   LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Just when it seemed that America's political and cultural discourse couldn't get much more absurd, here comes the Tom and Jerry show.   Tom Green and Jerry Springer are developing a "week in review"-style program tentatively dubbed "Fairly Unbalanced," which would feature comedian-actor Green and talk show host Springer discussing headlines and newsmakers and generally offering their observations on political and pop culture-oriented topics.   The show's producer, Lions Gate Television, began shopping the project to cable outlets earlier this week, according to studio president Kevin Beggs.   "We've conceived this as a weekly series that reviews current events and pop culture in a populist way from the off-centre perspective of two larger-than-life, outrageous, irreverent and endearing personalities, who don't always agree," Beggs said. "It will be informative yet entertaining. Just the thought of these two guys together makes you laugh."   Despite their wilder onscreen personas, both Green and Springer are "very engaged in the issues of the day" and share a populist perspective on politics and culture, Beggs said.   Green's status as a Canadian also will add some spark to his observations on  the U.S. political landscape, Beggs said.   Springer has hosted the raucous syndicated talk show "The Jerry Springer Show" since 1991. Before that, he pursued a career in politics, serving as mayor of Cincinnati in the late 1970s, and in 1982 he made a run for the governor's office in Ohio. Next week, he's set to serve as a delegate from Ohio at the Democratic National Convention in Boston, and he'll also provide from-the-floor commentary on the gathering for WOIO-TV Cleveland.   Green first made his mark in the late 1990s as the host of MTV's "The Tom Green Show," which featured Green engaging in outrageous stunts and pranks    urlLink  Tom&amp;Jerry      This would be Interesting to say the least  .

          Florida man accused of using  gator as weapon              Sunday, July 18, 2004 Posted: 8:42 AM EDT (1242 GMT)        PORT  ORANGE, Florida (AP) -- A man hit his girlfriend with a 3-foot alligator and  threw beer bottles at her during an argument in the couple's mobile home,  authorities said.    David Havenner, 41, was ordered held without bond Saturday on misdemeanor  charges of battery and possession of an alligator.   The alligator, which Havenner had been keeping in his bathtub, was turned  over to Florida wildlife officials.   Nancy Monico, 39, told investigators that Havenner beat her with his fists,  then grabbed the alligator and swung it at her as she tried to escape, sheriff's  spokesman Gary Davidson said. She said the animal hit her at least once. She  also told authorities that Havenner threw empty beer bottles at her, Davidson  said.   Havenner's version of the story differed. He told investigators that Monico  bit his hand because she was upset that they had run out of  alcohol.        http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/South/07/18/gator.weapon.ap/index.html       &nbsp;

      BLACKSVILLE, W.Va. (AP) - Warning: smoking in the toilet can be dangerous. A portable toilet exploded Tuesday after a man who was inside it lit a cigarette.  Emergency workers said the man was not severely injured and drove himself to Clay-Battelle Community Health Center. He was later transferred to Ruby Memorial Hospital. His name and condition were not available Wednesday.  The explosion, which occurred in Blacksville, resulted from a buildup of methane gas inside the portable toilet. The methane did not "take too kindly" to the lit cigarette, said a spokeswoman for Monongalia Emergency Medical Services.  ---  urlLink  Toilet Bomb   J.hn

      So this is the first day of my blog and my introduction to this. So forgive me if it is off or messed up.  I think I might try to win this  urlLink Beard Championship    Joke for the day   The preacher's, Sunday sermon was,"Forgive Your Enemies." He  asked,  how many have forgiven their enemies?  About half held up their hands.  He then repeated his question.  Now about 80 percent held up their hands.  He then repeated his question.  All responded, except one elderly lady.  "Mrs. Jones, are you not willing to forgive your enemies?"  "I don't have any."  "Mrs. Jones, that is very unusual. How old are you?"  "Ninety-three." she replied.  "Mrs. Jones, please come down in front and tell the  congregation how a person cannot have an enemy in the world?"  The little sweetheart of a lady tottered down the aisle, and  said, "I outlived the bitches. "   J.hn

                     &nbsp;LONDON (Reuters) - British police are trying to  track down jewelry once owned by the 18th century French Queen Marie Antoinette,  which burglars snatched from a west London house.   The victim of the burglary, a 65-year-old woman living in Notting Hill, was a  descendant of the lady-in-waiting to whom the queen gave the jewels, including a  diamond-encrusted locket and matching earrings, in the turmoil of the French  Revolution.    Marie Antoinette, who gave the woman the jewels when she realized what danger  she was in, was later imprisoned and beheaded by revolutionaries, as was her  husband Louis XVl.    "The victim is devastated. She has lost her family heirlooms and feels her  home has been violated," Peter Langdon of the London police told Reuters on  Friday.    Police believe two youths snatched the jewels without realizing they had  royal connections and may have discarded them as apparently worthless.    Police did not set a value on the jewels but said their owner described them  as "priceless."       I am sorry , but I don't think this is the kind  of&nbsp;stuff you keep at home.

                       MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Four members of a  family have been arrested and charged with murder for allegedly killing and  eating a relative during a wedding reception -- and serving his flesh to  unwitting party guests, police have said.    At the July 17 wedding of his daughter, Eladio Baule got angry with his  cousin Benjie Ganay who tripped and accidentally touched the bride's bottom,  said Senior Police Inspector Perla Bacuel, at Narra town in Palawan province,  southwest of Manila.   A few hours later, Baule, his son Gerald, another cousin Junnie Buyot and a  nephew, Sabtuari Pique, allegedly confronted Ganay, then drove him to a secluded  place where they stabbed him to death, Bacuel said.   Buyot, who surrendered to police and is acting as a witness, told police they  then roasted Ganay's body using coconut leaves and kerosene, Bacuel said.   Baule senior later forced Buyot to take a bite of Ganay's flesh, which he  claims he threw up but was then forced at knifepoint to swallow, Bacuel  said.   Buyot told police that the group returned to the party and served some of  Ganay's cooked remains to guests who were still celebrating the wedding, Bacuel  said.   "It was perhaps due to their drunkenness. They probably didn't know what they  were eating," he said.   Buyot reported the incident several days later to a local village leader who  took him to police. Pique also surrendered, and Baule and his son were  arrested.   Superintendent Rey Lanada, Palawan provincial police chief, said cannibalism  would be treated as an aggravating circumstance in the crime.     http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/08/10/philippines.cannibal.ap/index.html     Hmmm where did our crazy cousin go... dam this is salty meat.

                     &nbsp;OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - An Oklahoma ice cream  man opened fire on a customer after a summer ice cream sale turned sour, police  said on Tuesday.   Police in Enid, about 75 miles north of Oklahoma City, said they arrested  Markus Miller, 29, an ice cream truck driver for Summer Song, on Sunday on two  misdemeanor charges as well as a felony charge of pointing a firearm.    If convicted, Miller could receive up to 10 years in jail on the felony  charge.    According to police, an 18-year-old woman approached Miller's ice cream truck  and the conversation degenerated into a heated argument.    Miller is suspected of taking out a pistol and firing two shots at the feet  of the woman. She was struck on the collarbone-area by either a bullet fragment  or debris from the shots, police said.    Miller was arrested in his ice cream truck a short distance from the incident  and police recovered a hand gun from the vehicle, they said.    "It is not a normal or legal thing, anywhere in the country to carry a  handgun without a permit while selling ice cream," said Sgt.

                     &nbsp; Former priest James Porter,  a convicted pedophile now awaiting trial on Minnesota state's bid to keep him  locked up indefinitely as a sexually dangerous person, got married in prison  this week.  Porter married Anne Milner, a former nun he met more than 40  years ago while he was a young seminarian. The two met again three years ago  after Milner wrote him a letter in prison.  Porter, 69, was convicted in  1993 of sexually abusing 28 children. Although he completed his prison sentence  in January, Porter has remained in custody while state prosecutors seek to have  him committed.  Last month, following a two-week hearing, a judge in  Taunton Superior Court ruled that there is enough evidence to hold a trial on  the state's request.  Milner attended every day of Porter's hearing,  sporting a sapphire and diamond engagement ring.  Porter and Milner were  married Monday in a civil ceremony before a justice of the peace at the  Massachusetts Treatment Centre for sex offenders in Bridgewater, where he is  being held.  "It was the most beautiful day of my life," she told a local  newspaper. "It was the culmination of our hopes and dreams. It's a privilege, a  blessing."  Although she said she hopes their marriage will help his case  when he goes to trial, she insisted that's not why they got married.  She  said Porter's crimes are in the past.  "From the first days of his  incarceration, James Porter has had an insatiable desire to turn his life  around," she said.      &nbsp;      http://www.cathnews.com/news/405/118.php           God I could not  even make these up if I tried..

The Malawian priest, 43, and the 26-year-old nun from neighboring Zambia  spent the night in police cells after being caught in the act Wednesday, police  said.    A court in the capital Lilongwe handed down suspended jail sentences of six  months with hard labor after the pair pleaded guilty to charges of idleness and  disorderly conduct.    "These people were caught in a sex act," Assistant Superintendent Kelvin  Maigwa told Reuters.    Officials in the Roman Catholic Church, whose priests are barred from sex or  marriage, declined to comment.    Passers by alerted police at Lilongwe International Airport after the parked  Toyota Corolla, which had tinted windows, began shaking in what police described  as "a funny manner."    that is it we are all going to hell .....

                       &nbsp;   An Austrian man cut off his toes, fried them up and ate them between two  slices of bread after getting high sniffing butane gas.   When ambulance men arrived he offered to share his meal with them, passing  over a toe and saying: "It tastes like chicken, do you want some, there's a few  still left over."   Police said the 35-year-old suddenly became very hungry after sniffing the  gas and had searched all his kitchen cupboards, but found nothing to eat.   Grabbing a kitchen knife he cut off his toes on his left foot and dropped  them in the frying pan.   The man's sister called the police when she walked into the kitchen and saw  him making the toe sandwich.   By the time ambulance men arrived there was little of the hacked-off toes  left and a spokesman said: "What there was, was too badly burned to  re-attach."   A police spokesman added: "He told the ambulance men that he had more toes  than he needed and didn't think he would notice if he got rid of a few."   He was taken to a hospital in Steyr where he is recovering from his  injuries.    http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_791522.html?menu=news.quirkies    Nice one..   J,hn
