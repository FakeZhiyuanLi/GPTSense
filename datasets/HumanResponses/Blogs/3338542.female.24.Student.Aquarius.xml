       The GOOD DAY   Yesterday morning..  I woke up to Isaiah's phone call asking me if I was going to accompany him in court.  At first I couldn't even register what he was talking about... (lol) I had only slept for a couple hours by then.  So i was going to attempt to meet him in court at 8:30am... and that means 9 am for me =)  When I got there the first thing i wanted to do was give him a big, huge hug... i know that he's been stressing over this.   It was going relatively well, he was waiting to speak to the prosecutor.  let's skip ahead.  The prosecutor and Isaiah were speaking when I came out of the court room and completely missing each other.  Isaiah was saying that his driving record was clear according to the sheet from Washington state on May 3 or something like that... but the problem was, the prosecutor was saying that the ticket was issued April 13th so on that day his license was suspended.  He and Isaiah were completely missing each other on that small fact and... ugh.. it was just a miscommunication.  Well he came out pretty unscathed and with a fine of $250.  We decided to eat and then he was going to head out to work, but that didn't happen.  We went to dave and busters~! yay .. we had so much fun.. (i killed him in the many, many basketball games..) It was amazing.. i felt like i was flying being there with him... First the connection at church and then me telling him how i felt and we just connected in a different way.. we were starting to really communicate better.....  THE PHONE CALL FROM HELL....  Then his mom called on the way back from Dave and Busters... in the conversation he went on to tell her about the ticket and the fines he paid... but somehow along the lines he told her that I help him clear out the misunderstanding between him and the prosecutor and at the mere mention of my name.. all hell broke loose.. she began to question him and grill him on why i was there and why i shouldnt be there and it was my fault he had tickets to begin with because i kept him out late or something..(completely not true.. the ticket was during the day or dusk or something..)  He tried to tell her that I had helped him out but she just made him feel guilty for it.. and the bad part was. .i could hear her saying things about me... really negative things.. It really got to me at this point...  i pray for this woman.. i have the same interest in mind as she does.. we both want Isaiah to be happy... what is her problem? I feel sooooo strained.. when i try to maintain the whole "turn the other cheek" thing.. its hard when you are trying and the other person is striking..

      okay.. maybe i am just a drama queen, but i really like it when a guy knows when to ask someone if they are okay.  I called Isaiah today and hung up before he picked up... naturally he called back, but a thought ran through my mind.. "would he even have called today at all??" (at this point it was almost 5.)  I felt like a murderer... I got my period today.. although i have so many reasons to not want this baby.. i was kinda hoping that i would be pregnant.... now that i am not. its really hard...   he should have called.. (in my girly eyes)

      Church today.. it was nice to say the least.  God works in mysterious ways... people dont just seem to say that for no reason.  Its not like I didnt know this before, but now it seems so much more clear... so why am I still stuggling sometimes?  there is so much to deal with... Isaiah and I are supposedly happy and doing this strange rendition of a relationship where he gets this chance to find his path back to himself, God, and what love really means.  But for me, I am not as happy as I would like to be.  I know that the events of Tuesday night (restraining and abandoning me stuff) isnt really at all like him, but it distrubes me to no end ... that through it all I didn't even feel an ounce of who i know is him.  Even now when we talk about it, its not like he says stuff that I really need to hear.. like "i want you to know how sorry i am for the pain that i caused".. or something.. not that i think its all his fault.. but i wish when we talked about it, that the most important part of the conversation to him isnt how the police officer did his job and more about the events and the feelings destroyed in the process that was damaging because of impluse and rage....  I guess what i want is to have to feel for a moment what it was like for me... to say something...something that acknowledges some of the pain rendered to me and not focusing on.. his pain.. because i do that for him...

       prepping for the events of today   I decided that I am going to get my necklace today, but I just don't know how it will go.  There's so many things I want to say, but I know that it won't go the way I would like it to.  (God please help me)  I want to hand him a Praise & Worship CD that I've compiled to help me get through this tough time, but I just feel like if I try to hand it to him, one of 3 things will happen.  1. He won't take it  2. "escort" will grab it from me and say I shouldn't offer it to him 3. he will take it and destroy it in front of my face  someone told me that he is just using this trivial argument to find a way for the breakup to be my fault.. because he doesnt want me to break up with him the next time and it be his fault... i can see that.. hes been hurt so bad in his life... he told me once that he tried everything to push me away... and that i never left... we'll its true i never wanted to just walk away when i knew he was upset... i wasnt trying to stay as his girlfriend.. i was trying to stay as a friend.. I'm not walking away from this by trying to get my necklace.. just trying to take away something of mine from his possession because he has everything else that is intangible... everything else that can cause so much more pain...  I don't know how he's going to take me going there to get my necklace... he threatened to put a restraining order on me the first time that we had our argument (i dont know if it would have passed as grounds for me being restrained at all according to my Harvard Law School friend...), but still I don't want to give him a chance to make me out to be a harrasser... so.. I'm taking an escort.  I feel that because he is so sensitive that he'll freak out again...   he might get mad that i brought an "escort" with me to get something.. He might get the idea that I think he's dangerous..(which i dont) He might think that I am trying to make him look bad (im not) I feel like i have to do this.. even though there might be a chance that he'll be more upset that I brought a third party into this.. i feel like if i dont bring someone on my behalf.. he'll use it against me.. I'm damned if i do and damned if i dont... trapped....  I'm sure deep down inside the real Isaiah exists.. the one that talked to me on Sunday.. the one the broke down and realized i was there to help... the one that realizes that He isnt the only one that can get hurt....  I'll be there for him whenever he needs me if i can.. (even though my friends plan to physically restrain me.)  Well.. time to pray before I go.

      I decided last night to visit the beach I went to with Isaiah  1. because i love that beach 2. because this is where i was last happy  I walked along the beach and found the ditch that we dug to start a firepit.  I didn't really have anything with me to start a fire so I just perched myself further down the beach...  i laid down in the cold sand and looked up at the stars in the sky.   I wanted to walk down to the water... but i didnt.. I was afraid it would just bring on too much emotion.. one of the things i remembered was standing there kissing Isaiah and then... a wave came up and got us wet up to our ankles.. (it was like a scene out of a movie)   I got there and stayed on the sand.. and at this point i was so overwhelmed.. i got down on my knees and prayed.  I know at this point all that i have done makes it seem like i am the worst "christian" in the world.. I guess thats what happens when you start to fall away from God... But i prayed.. for all the pain to stop...(again) for Isaiah.. and then me if it was in his ultimate plan.. Iprayed for his family (even though they hate me).. i prayed for his life (future success).. i prayed for all his friends..(that they guide him through this tough time).. and i prayed for...... (i havent thought of names yet for the baby.. if there is one, but I am pretty sure.. they say that you just know...i think i just know..)  I must have been there for hours and hours.. because when i started driving back.. i could see the sky getting lighter from the sun getting ready to rise...  it dawned on me... I love him... (almost too much for my own good)... but God would take care of me because Isaiah wasn't... right??  Isaiah.. still has my necklace.. deep down inside.. i wish that he was just keeping it because a part of him that isn't being controlled by this growing hate.. still realizes that he loves me...  Ive never been so hurt by a break-up... maybe its because i know that Isaiah would never normally break-up over something like a misunderstanding (knock vs call) like this... i dont even know the most unstable of couples who would... thats why i know this isnt like him.. (its hard to remember that sometimes..when i am at the doctor's offices alone.)... i think id better run away soon.. as soon as i start to show... (i dont think praying will help how i feel about this...)

      I asked God to help me, but help everyone I love first... especially Isaiah... this is what i got back in response.. these songs came to me..   Hungry (Falling On My Knees)   Hungry, I come to you for I know you satisfy I am empty, but I know Your love does not run dry   And so I wait for You so I wait for You                         I'm falling on my knees              Offering all of me         Jesus, You're all this heart is living for    Broken, I run to You for Your arms are open wide I am weary, but I know Your touch restores my life And so I wait for You so I wait for You      A Pure Heart   A pure heart, that’s what I long for. A heart that follows hard after Thee; A pure heart, that’s what I long for. A heart that follows hard after Thee.    VERSE: A heart that hides Your Word So that sin will not come in. A heart that’s undivided But one You rule and reign; A heart that beats compassion, That pleases You, my Lord. A sweet aroma of worship That rises to Your throne.    Be The Centre   VERSE 1: Jesus, be the centre Be my source, be my light Jesus  Jesus, be the centre Be my hope, be my song Jesus  CHORUS: Be the fire in my heart Be the wind in these sails Be the reason that I live Jesus, Jesus  VERSE 2: Jesus, be my vision Be my path, be my guide Jesus     Be the Centre (ver. 2)  VERSE 1: Jesus, be the centre Be my source, be my light Jesus  Jesus, be the centre Be my hope, be my song Jesus  CHORUS: Be the fire in my heart Be the wind in these sails Be the reason that I live Jesus, Jesus  VERSE 2: Jesus, be my vision Be my path, be my guide Jesus   Change My Heart, Oh God   Change my heart oh God, make it ever true. Change my heart oh God, may I be like You.          You are the potter,         I am the clay,         Mold me and make me,         This is what I pray.      I feel like JOB... like all this pain has a greater purpose.. but for now i hurt... and it seems endless...    Job's Song  Been broken, put through the fire, Felt the heat melt all my strength away. Felt so lonely, felt so abandoned "Where is God?" I heard my little voice say.           I need You, I need You,              Oh Lord please hold me next to You.           I need You, I need You,         Oh Lord, don't let me fall from You.  Lord I know this world isn't easy, And I know that You never promised no pain. Trials will come and trials will test me, But help me Lord, it's hard to see them as gain.  I forgot that You're right here beside me, Let me know that You're with me through the length. Though I'm weak, Lord, this is my prayer, Through my weakness, Lord please be my strength.

        So today is a new day    I've decided that I can't seem to go through with getting an emergency contraceptive pill to abort this possible baby I have.    I've also been through so many thoughts today about Isaiah...   I remembered bringing him this asian braised beef with rice (i thought he would love it)  I remembered eating out at Buddakahn.. it was so wonderful.. it was like a dreamstate...  I remembered walking through New Hope, PA.  true bliss...  I remembered the first time i let him see me with out my security blanket..(my make-up) and he still found me beautiful  I remembered the first time i saw him wear clothes that I REALLY LOVED... those cute little express jeans...  I remembered the way his arms felt..  I remembered him holding me in the rain..  I remembered the first time he heard me play the piano (el shaddai)  I remembered standing out in the freezing sub-zero cold watching him wash his car.... and the cute way his butt shakes when he's waxing..  I remembered writing "i love you" in chinese characters on his back..  I rememebered finding a piano in the casinos of Atlantic City and just watching the snow fall outside the window as we played piano together.. (i taught him a duet)  I remember gazing into his eyes and getting lost  I remember the first time i let him gaze back into mine.  I remembered what it feels like to sit in his lap and have him embrace me...  I remembered the way our bodies felt next to each other's...  I remembered the way we made love...  I remembered what it was like to be happy..there are so many good memories...   but now all i can do.. is pray.. for his life to unfold the way God wants it to.. and that he finds his way back to God.. because hes hurting.. and i know that he knows the only way to make it stop is to find him... counseling.. for the pain he feels from his past... his father...and other family memebers for hurting him when he disclosed information about their whereabouts to his father. I dont care if Isaiah hates me.. as long as it serves some kind of purpose of making him feel better... what i ultimately want for him .. is for his pain that he carries around everyday of his life to be lifted......  Some moments of the day i want to be angry with him.. but then the reality of it all sets in... this isnt him.. i cant be mad at him.. he would never do this to anyone.. ever...

      Possibly Pregnant (alone) lost my boyfriend My grades suffering Parents denying me  Trying to figure out what happened from Sunday to tuesday night seems impossible. Let's unravel the events that lead up to this...   HOW WE RESTORED OUR BALANCE....  Sunday.  I had decided that I would be in my ex-boyfriend Isaiah's life to help him through his problems.  I really care about him and do love him, and since I am the only person that he says he has been able to open up to this much, I thought I would be his "therapist." Everything was going well until Monday, I decided to go to the beach with him.  We tried to convince his roomie "Ryan" to come along and bring his friend "Ron."  No such luck, so "Isaiah" and I went alone.   MONDAY:THE BEACH, THE LOVE REKINDLED, THE MISUNDERSTANDING  The drive was amazing, the T-tops out and nothing but the pine barrens around on this long stretch of road.  The music was playing  Jessica Simpson's song "Be".. which I love because it reminds of how I felt before and still feel now about Isaiah.  It was perfect, but I had to tell him that I couldn't just be his friend.   We kind of just tried to ignore that last comment, besides, I wanted him to regard it as a moment of extreme weakness.  You see, the night before (sunday) he had understood that I was only to be his "therapist," but it was really hard for him to separate the love he had for me romantically and the love he had for me as a person.  So my comment wasn't helping this relationship stay platonic. We got to the beach, tried to start a fire, and then failed. =)  I guess we needed better kindling. We gave up and I walked to out to the water and just started at this endless moonlight-blue ocean in front of me that seemed to touch the star filled sky.  It was beautiful.  It almost felt like God set this moment up.  I felt him walk up behind and hold me and before I knew it, we were kissing. It was amazing it felt so right and so untouchable by the flaws that all humans have that ruins what is so pure in relationships, love.  I felt like I was falling in love again...only this time it was deeper than before and the bottom seemed like it didnt exist. We went home and when we got back to his apartment, we just kissed all night and then... it happened.. we slept together, and this is where I think that I might be pregnant.  I said "don't stop" and he took it as... me telling him not to think about withdrawing...which I completely wasnt saying (we tend to have huge misunderstandings like this).. And now I think I'm pregnant.  But he promised to stay with me through it all..   THE BEGINNING OF THE HORRIBLE ENDING  Tuesday.. I wanted to see him so we had dinner.  On the way (we met in the middle of our hometowns) he was on the phone with me and told me that he had much to do: car dealership to get a car part, Laundry, and something else... (i can't remember).  This all happened in the first conversation. After about 20 mins I called him back so that he wouldn't miss the cafe because he wasn't framiliar with it.  He had told me something along the lines of being "glad that he made that stop because then he would have been on the wrong road."  Well, we had dinner, during which he told me that the day before (Monday) when i was trying to convince his roommate to come along with us to the beach, he had basically insulted me to my face.  I have to admit i as furious.. (this is a messy story so i'll skip ahead).  After dinner, I had to go home.  We kissed and said our reluctant good-byes and which point I told him that I was really upset with his roommate Ryan. We'll I had been worried about my grades suffering beacuse of the complications that had risen during my relationsihp with Isaiah.  My grades were taking a HUGE toll, but it's really because I was so caught up in trying to fix "us" that I lost my priorities along the way.  So on the drive home from the cafe, my friend called and told me that the grades were posted up.  Needless to say that when I got home I immediately went to check my grades... and its sad to say that my grades fell far short of what i wanted.  Upset and hurt and already vulnerable from thinking that at any moment he would leave me alone to handle this potential pregnancy, I jumped back in my car and headed towards his place.  As i was driving, I tried calling him several times, but there was no answer, but for some reason I just kep driving towards his place hoping that I would be able to meet him there.  I thought that he was doing the things he needed to do earlier that day...so, when i got there i found that his car was parked in front of his apartment, but he was still not answering his phone.  At this point a thousand thoughts crossed my mind (maybe he went with Ryan to the car dealership, maybe he is at the laundry facility building, maybe he is in the car with Ryan and can't hear his phone (because its very rare for him to not answer the phone).  I drove by the laundry place and realized that he wasn't there.  And then I decided to go to the car dealership and catch him there.  But i figured i would just drive back to the apartment and check one last time and hope that his roomie's car was back.     THE MESSY END  "He's got to be home now~!" i thought... So i tried calling Isaiah to get him to come out because I didnt want to see Ryan because of what Isaiah had told me about Ryan saying bad things about me...I called and called again like 2 times i think... and then he walked out the front door on the phone.  OH~ hes on the phone?? he pointed for me to park .. and when i did i jumped out of the car hoping that I would be comforted by him... Instead he looked at me and said "why didnt you knock?"  at this point i was shocked and hurt even more... i was expecting open arms to cry into .. and instead i was fed this suspicious, semi-angry question that made it sound like he was implying that i was doing something wrong by being there.. at this point i just walked away.. hurt.. and wishing that someone cared.. When he didnt even want to see what was wrong.. i turned back around and confonted him..  "WHat is wrong with you~!" i screamed... (when i get hurt and mistreated.. i cant think)..  he said, "why couldnt you just answer my question? Why did you calling instead of knock?"   i didnt even know what he was getting at but i could tell what he was implying about me wasnt good at all and this made me more furious because it was easier to be angry than hurt.  "i dont know.. i didnt want to see Ryan and I didnt think you were home."  I replied. "Both our cars were here" "no they weren't" "yes they were" "i parked in his parking spot next to your car because it wasnt here when i called you the first time, how are you going to tell me that it was here?" "when you called, i came out and you were right in front of the apartment and both cars were there." at this point i realized he had no idea that i had called earlier and shown up earlier.. when i proceeded to tell him .. he didn't believe me and told me i should have knocked.. I told him that i thought he had left to do his errands.. and he just did not want to hear me. it escalated.. and then before i knew it..  he turned on me and said. "you have to go" i was in shock. was i really being kicked out of my boyfriend's apartment for not knocking??? basically it came down to him calling the cops on me because i woudnt leave as soon as he said it... he almost put a restraining order on me.. and he never wants to see me again.. i wish i knew what he was so mad about.. because all i can think of.. is me not answering his question when he wanted it answered.. and me calling instead of knocking.. or maybe its because i wasnt being rational.. in his eyes.. but for me.. i was hurt.. i really thought i was being rational.. either way.. him being so hateful.. especially when i am not allowed to call him b/c he could put a restraining order on me.. and he can call me.. and pretend that he's having sex on the phone... when i am alone dealing with this pregnancy ..and the promise that he broke when he said he would stick around... I KNOW THIS IS NOT LIKE HIM.. i know that he hurts from something so much more deeper than this.. so as much as all my friends and family want me to hate him.. i know him better than this.. something is so wrong.. and i wish i could help.. but how can i when all he wants to do is hurt me?... Isaac would never be the type to break someone's heart, especially someone he loves... and may have gotten pregnant.. hes not the type to get mad at somthing this small and freak out about it...  something is wrong.. something is hurting him so much more than I could have ever done.. this isnt like him.. I wish i could save him from it..... But what can i do but pray...
