      Okay, I have been encountering some difficulty in contacting the Rotary Club of Saint John. Y'see, at first I tried to communicate via the most obvious route available to me: I called the phone number in the phonebook. Which of course directed me to the "Boys & Girls Club." No one there could help me, but they told me to call in the morning, at around eight o'clock.  So I did. I asked for... whoever the woman of the previous evening had directed me to. I can't remember her name. In any case, she directs me to the Rotary Club of Saint John. Twitch.  And I get an answering machine. Apparently Heather Peterson is in Halifax on business. Well, that's all well and good. I leave her a message. The next day, I don't get a call. The day after that, I don't get a call.  So, I decide to call the Rotary Club again. But, having expected her to call me back, I didn't write down the number. As thus, I call up the Boys & Girls Club again. But, again, I have to call up at eight o'clock to get the number. I do so. I call the number given. Answering machine, only this time it tells me she's in Halifax on business. She'll be back on August 16. My frustration grows.  So I don't leave her another message so as to be a nuisance. She'll surely get the message when she returns. But she doesn't call on the sixteenth. Nor the seventeenth. Nor the eighteenth. On the nineteenth, I complain openly to my parents. And they have an obvious reason: she must have one of the answering machines that deletes messages after a week. So now I'm just pretty fucking mad.  It is right now the twentieth. I have once again been forwarded through the Boys & Girls Club, and I called up the Rotary Club, only to discover Heather Peterson's answering machine waiting for me once again. (Fortunately, the note on Halifax has been removed, so I'm okay.) I leave a message. Two minutes later, I leave another with my phone number. (It took great mental strain to sound kind and polite when I have developed a rather potent hatred for this elusive woman. To slip up might be tolerable.) I am now going to explore other methods of communication with Rotary. E-mail? Smoke signals? Driving up to Saint John and yelling at people a lot?  My Thai is progressing pretty well I think. I'm 1% fluent! I'm also trying to learn a lot about Thai history, politics, and culture, and I'm trying to get my wimpy Western taste buds ready for an onslaught of spice. Current training: very spicy Colombian food prepared by Suzanna. I'm handling it pretty well.  As an aside, my trip to Iceland looks relatively impossible. I won't be helped by any organization for this one, so airfare will be a hassle.

      And I have a reason! You see, punk is crazy and nonconformist, correct? Spiky hair, pink and black, crazy shit like that! But, now, think about it. Punk is now a style. Once punk was classified as a style, punk was no longer punk. You cannot be punk if you go to you a store that sells punk clothing exclusively! Punk cannot have a standardized color of pink and black! The noncorformists have conformed! So, all of you who are punk, stop! Be something else! Wear silk sheets dipped in black paint or some crazy thing! But don't be punk, because being punk is a goddamn oxymoron.  By the way, goth is a still pure style. Goths are nonconformist, sure, but that isn't really what they're all about. They're about being dark. So that's all right. If the whole world is dark, the real goths don't care. They just do what they want.  For those who mix the goth style and the punk style, stop. You annoy me. At least those who do it on purpose. They are kinda close, so similarities are bound to occur, and that's all right. But you can't be a goth with spiked jet black hair with pink tips. That isn't being dark, that's being a spectacle.

      After a hiatus of six days, it's time to update you on everything! I have several topics that I think I shall discuss, most of which you have not yet heard of.   Kyra's Birthday:  Kyra Horton, my best friend since Grade Three, had a birthday on August the eleventh. (I was reminded on August the ninth.) My other friend, Colin Watts, oblivious to the significance of the eleventh, informed Kyra that he was holding a generic party on the twelfth. It did not take long for this party to be corrupted into Kyra's birthday party.  I presented my gift on the birthday proper, by the way. I rented both volumes of Kill Bill, and because that only cost me four dollars, I gave her the spare loonie. ^ ^  In any case, the party! One of the best I've been to, I must say, regardless of the fact that it dripped of immaturity and that the pool was a miniature. The thing was immature because Kyra and Colin are decidely so, as were many of the guests. There was no beer, there was no making out in the corner, and so on and so forth. Only a few people there probably have ever been to a hardcore party, to be honest. But hell, it was a party of friends, and it was fun. ^ ^  I came to the party with Kyra, Kirsten Kukula, and Kirsten's parents. (Who else would drive the car?) As a bit of background, Kirsten is a good friend of both Kyra and Emily, though Emily and Kyra don't particularly like each other. (Something about Emily wronging Kyra in the fourth grade, I dunno. Pretty idiotic to still hold a grudge.) Kirsten is from a German background, and is  very  proud of her heritage. She is also very Christian (a real bible thumper) and has on more than one occasion tried to convert the atheist Kyra, the Wiccan Emily, or my mildly Christian-Hindu self. On all occasions she's been quite unsuccessful. All that said, while she may not approve of a lot of things, she'll let it fly, and only warn you once every three months or so. Besides, she's not perfect herself, having cut a cross into her flesh with a can opener and sneaking around behind her parents' backs to meet her boyfriend. She fits in well. ^ ^  So, we arrive at the party. Waiting outside were Jackie and Megan. I don't know much about Jackie. She's just a girl that hangs around school. Megan is a friend who I became a bit estranged from last year. I started hanging around with a different group then were at this party - Emily and Kirsten among them - so we didn't see each other as much, and this was actually a major get-together for Megan and all the other people who both lived out of town and I didn't see much at school. In any case, Jackie and Megan were playing basketball as Megan's mother, not yet out of the driveway, was talking to them. Colin's little brother was on the deck, waiting for his dad to take him golfing, I believe.  So, yeah, after a little while I go into the basement, where I was greeted with blasting music, strobe lights, plasma lamps, and various other optical feasts. The music was mostly Gob, Sum 41, Hoobastank, people like them. Pretty good, if a little generic. He had good food though. Blue Kool-Aid is better than Jean Chretien on a good day, and gummy bears top even that. And he had all dressed chips!  !!!  So, yeah, skip skip skip, the pool. Now I didn't know Colin had a pool, and if I had I am most sure I would have taken something to swim in. But I didn't know, and I didn't take anything. So I stole some of Colin's shorts, and off I went. And that was the best part of the party. For a good chunk of it, I was alone in the pool with Jackie, Kirsten, and Danielle, a good friend I've had since she played on the same baseball team as I did in Grade One. Yes, very far back. I learned one thing about Jackie that day: hyper. You could not relax in that pool, at all. Why? Because Jackie wants to kill you. ^ ^  Later, however, some people who had been inside trickled outside, prepared or no. Kyra jumped right in. (I'm wasn't getting my clothes wet! I like Colin's couches too much. They is the comfy. Plus I'm an exhibitionist.) Long story short, there are a lot of people in a very small pool, most wearing clothing and all seeing what it might be like to drown; Jackie was very demonstrative.  Skip skip skip, I am at the nearby playground, where the party has shifted to, and who do we meet? Bill! For those of you who don't know, Bill was driving to Moncton on a motorbike when he realized he wasn't going to make it by nightfall. So, he settled down for the night in the red plastic tube of Pleasant Valley Park's jungle gym. We brought him food. ^ ^ Another great accomplishment of the night was he managed to squeeze  six  people in that red plasic tube! That's a lot. Megan was just over halfway in, and I climbed on top of the knees of all the people within; Axe had to grab my hand and pull me so I could actually get in. (Axe is my given name for Joel, a person I met for the first time at the party. I didn't find out his real name until the end; he told me near the beginning, but 'Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous' was too loud for me to hear it.)  While Pleasant Valley Park is very much illuminated by street lights, almost none of this light spills over onto the adjacent field; it is veiled in shadow at, the stark contrast of the bright park and it adding to the deepness of the black. And was it ever a perfect place to see that night's meteor shower. Granted, I only saw two against the velvet, diamond-studded sky, but I had to leave before midnight, after which there was supposed to be one meteor every minute. (I must say, I was very pissed at my mother at that point, though it passed.) In any case, only four more meteors were seen that night at my house; the many street lights where I live make for a lot of light pollution.  My one qualm about the party. Emily couldn't make it. :(  However...   Emily's Birthday:  Emily was originally having her birthday party on the twenty-eighth, although she says she's going to change that. My sister and her fiancee, Jorg, (yep, I got the name, and it's pronounced like 'yoge') are coming to Sussex on that same day, and I really didn't want to pick girlfriend or sister. So, she's changing it the twenty-fifth most likely. In any case, this party will be decidely smaller. It will be only me, Emily, Kirsten, Kirsten Smith (a crazy friend of Emily's who lives out of town; I've met her only once, but spoken to her on MSN Messenger quite a bit), and Mitchell, Emily's both hilarious and obnoxious cousin.  Emily lives way out of town in Norton, which is a part of Greater Sussex. It's a farming community that is composed largely of hicks and drunks, homophobes and racists. However, Emily's family is rather unlike the majority of those assholes, both in that they wouldn't throw rocks at black people and in that they actually make some money. That's not to say Emily's family aren't assholes in their own respect though. I've met Emily's stepmom but once, and found her rather nice, though she may be deceptively so. She has definitely wronged Emily in many ways; due to way Emily presents herself, she feels she is something of a drug addict, kleptomaniac whore. Emily is in fact a virgin, and has only rarely drank small amounts of beer. And no, she doesn't steal.  In any case, with luck, the stepmom will not be a major roadblock to the party. It's unlikely she will be, as she knows all the other guests. However, I, the newcomer, could be in her mind a manwhore poised to fuck her stepdaughter. (Sure, it's on my mind, but Emily deserves better, and because I know she doesn't want sex with her previous boyfriends, I'm not imposing.) I just hope I made a good first impression; in retrospect, I believe I was silent and respectful. Probably only because she didn't say anything that was stereotyping or some such.  But the party! The negative bits aside, let's get the good stuff. ^ ^ I need to buy Emily a present of some sort, though I am not sure as to what should be chosen by myself. However, I am bringing baked goods of some sort. Cookies? Cake? Brownies? Gotta love your mother being a wonderful cook. :D I'm going to ask her soon what she wants. And guess what? Emily has a pool! I get to show off my sexy body! Oh, and swim... ^ ^   Kelly and Jorg:  Yup, I mentioned Kelly coming over on the twenty-eighth. It'll be the first time she's come over since she visited in February of 2003. That's about a year and a half ago! And, yup, she is bringing her fiancee with her. Jorg, from Germany. The only German I know is 'Ich ben ein schwein,' which Kirsten told me meant 'hello.' That was a pretty fun party, considering it really means 'I am a pig.' I can't wait to meet the guy, nor can I wait to see Kelly again.  This'll be the second time Kelly has brought someone interesting to our house. (I find anyone from different cultures very interesting, seeing as I live in a very conservative, monocultural part of Canada, in stark contrast to the beautiful ethnic mixes of Toronto, Vancouver, or Montreal.) The last time was in Grade Four, when Kelly visited for Christmas with Cindy, an exchange student from Costa Rica. I didn't fully appreciate what Costa Rica was at the time; all I knew was that they ate spicy food and spoke Spanish. If I had just known the questions to ask... ^ ^  Jorg and Kelly will be staying at our cottage at Pokeshaw for a few days, an Irish community on New Brunswick's predominantly Acadian North Shore. (The Rierdens, a very nice Irish family, own it, but allow us to use it.) Dad and Jordan are going to drive up there and retrieve them on the twenty-eighth. I lost in the coin toss, though to be honest, I was hoping to lose. I did not want to be in that car for the whole trip to Pokeshaw; it's not exactly pleasant. However, I showed interest because it would hurt my dad's feelings to not care. (Technically, we could fit five people in the car, but that would be a furnace.)   Thailand:  Thailand is my goal. I will get to Thailand, and with luck, I will be in Thailand at the start of my Grade Eleven year. (I'm starting my Grade Ten year in September.) My method of getting to Thailand: the Rotary Club Youth Exchange. To be accepted, I need good marks. Check. And I need a good attitude. Check. And, though not necessary, it wouldn't hurt to learn a little of the language. (Sawatdee khrab! Chorb ar-han phet!) So, I think I'm a shoo-in. Besides, the Rotary Club Youth Exchange is  cheap , and if I am accepted, I am gonna rely on Sussex, a town I love despite its various shortcomings, to pay the few expenses. Because they will send me there, because sending someone to Thailand is something that doesn't happen often here.  And I know I'm gonna love it in Thailand. A beautiful landscape, a rich Buddhist culture, friendly people, one of the safest countries in Asia, and not too mention the great cuisine, the great art, and the beautiful language whose intricacies I have yet to fully unravel. Even the history is dramatic! (Thailand is the only Southeast Asian nation never conquered by a European power, among other things.) It's the perfect place to live in as a teenager. ^ ^  Which is why it's my goal. I will be in Thailand. Nothing will stop me. Even if I can't go next year, I  will  go. No question.   Iceland:  Now, Thailand is my goal, but Iceland is certainly looking a bit more accessible. My father made a lot of friends around the world in his traveling years, and apparently, I have a free place to stay in Reykjavik, "if I ever want to go." Which I do. A lot. So long as it doesn't interfere with Thailand. As much as I like Iceland, it's the newcomer, and I've got fixed priorities. ^ ^  Which is why I am thinking I might be able to go to Iceland for January, February, and March. Won't interfere, I'll learn the basics of being a goodwill ambassador, I'll learn a lot about Iceland and Icelandic culture, and I might even come out with a third language under my belt. (Icelandic counts as four languages, actually, as it is mutually understandable with Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish.) :D Not to mention Iceland is one of the coolest countries in existence. No military and it opposed Great Britain. Descended almost exclusively from about four hundred Scandinavian settlers. Earthquakes are as exciting as breakfast. Overwhelmingly weird, overwhelmingly hip, and overwhelmingly blonde, that's the way I'd describe Iceland. ^ ^  And I really want to go!

      I gave her a reality check. She told me that earlier today. So, I got through to her. And I feel good. ^ ^  And I really can't think of anything more to say. I'll be back in time, brothers and sisters! :D

      Well, I did a bad thing. I checked Emily's blog, and it's all there in writing. Gavin did  not  do good.  But I stand by my opinions. Emily is perhaps an unhappy person. I am definitely a happy sort of person. (This may not be evidenced by these first entries.) But, whenever she moans about how bad a writer she is, she drags me down with her. I start saying I'm a bad writer! But I'm not! I say it out of sympathy, but then I feel like  it's true . And I don't like that feeling. I am a good writer, I know it, I write circles around the competition. (Modesty be damned.) And I also know that people that do nothing but feel sorry for themselves really piss me off. I have not had a perfect life! Do I give a damn? No! I have fun. And a lot of it.  Which is why I am confused as to why I like this rather depressed, gothic person. I like her a hell of a lot. What I don't like is her going on and on about her life sucks, and reading her blog and seeing that I am like the only important thing in it. On and on she goes!  I don't care if she did kill her dog. No regret. Never. I do not regret exploding on her yesterday, now that I am a little less panicked. Not at all.

      I just exploded on my girlfriend on MSN Messenger. The time is 10:45 PM, though this entry may be put in sometime after that. She was going on about it was her fault that her cousin's dog died or something. And it pissed me off. Why? Because she always feels  something  is her fault. Always.  So I told her to stop. And I think I was rather mean in doing so. And now I am twitching. I think its all the sugar I had not to long ago. (Massive amounts, I assure.) But I said fuck a bit more than I ought to, and I think I said one word that should have been a different word. 'Love' was 'like.' I liked her, I didn't love her. And I don't know if that's right. I really don't. I am confused. Very confused. In any case, she said she had to sleep. And she logged off.  But wasn't I saying the right thing? I don't know. I think I was, but maybe it didn't come out right. I'm an idiot for having closed that chatlog, and deleting it forever. And she's probably home crying. Why? Because I am a fucking asshole who smashed her for thinking she killed her dog while she was at her cousin's. And I hate that she would blame herself for that. She couldn't stop it. No one could. Maybe when I'm a bit less confused I might say something else. Bye.

      I think I should lay down my life as it is at the moment, for the convenience of you the reader.  Let's start with family. I am the son of John Steeves and Donna Steeves (she was Evans at the time she met my father, and before that she was a Cluett). I have four siblings: Jordan Steeves, Kelly Steeves, Megan Evans, and Daniel Evans. Myself and younger Jordan are the children of John and Donna; Kelly is the daughter of John and his exwife Barbara, and they both live in Ottawa; Daniel and Megan are the adopted children of Donna and her exhusband, who I am afraid I don't even the name of. I do know that this exhusband died of a heart attack in March, and that Megan and Daniel went to the funeral back in Newfoundland; my mother did not feel the need to go.  Megan moved to Calgary in search of work about three years ago, and the last time I saw her was when she came down for Christmas. She is funny, nice, very quick-witted, and generally an awesome big sister. At the time when she left, I was too young to appreciate how cool she was, but on Christmas, we really had fun. Her apartment is now occupied by someone else; no more Christmas trees with beer bottles for stars. She has had a few jobs back in Calgary, and I wouldn't be able to tell you which one she's on now. I miss her very much.  Kelly has, of course, always lived in Ottawa, so I've never had much contact with her. She is one of my greatest friends in the world, however, and whenever she visits, I try to make the most out of it. The last visit was of about two weeks in late February 2003. She has since become 'going to be engaged,' and at the end of August I'm going to meet her 'soon-to-be' fiancee. I am of course terrible with names, but this fellow is German, who I believe she met either studying at her college in Ottawa, or possibly on one of her trips to Latin America. (Kelly has had an extended period of time in Central America, and I believe she also visited Argentina when she was thirteen or so?) Whatever the case, Kelly spent some time recently in this fellow's village back in Germany. Her current location is Yellowknife, where she's working with a architectural company design a website. (Kelly's major in college is architecture.)  Daniel is the big tough one. As the oldest, he moved out the earliest, but he never left Sussex. He was rather aloof for a few years, and then his girlfriend got pregnant, and he lived with us for just over a year while he went to university, working on mechanics. I got to know him pretty well over that year. About a year ago, he moved in with with his girlfriend, Suzanna, his daughter, Arianna, and Suzanna's other children, Julianne and Ashley. He got a factory job in Moncton, and with his massively increased income, they bought a new house in town. (They had previously been living in the nearby backwoods of Nightville.) He spends a good portion of the day working, and he also has to commute about an hour between Sussex and Moncton; the time to spend with his new family is limited.  Jordan is the only brother who is just a brother. Not a stepsister, not an adopted stepbrother. He is also the only sibling younger than myself, and he is the only sibling I currently live in the same house with. He is currently a yellow belt in taekwondo, and has built himself a nunchaku, a three-sectioned staff, and two tonfa. He also bought a gundo sword (wooden, for training purposes), and I bought him a birthday gift: two professionally made tonfa. It put a bit of a hole in my wallet, but I'm wealthy for my age, so meh. Jordan's most notable feature is his hair, which is a monstrous, black, curly thing. Large curls. Like, you can stick a finger in the loop of the curl without disturbing any hair. I'm not exaggerating. He's rather shallow - swears a lot when his friends are over to look cool, for an example - but he's young.  In a way, I have new brothers and sisters in Arianna, Julianne, and Ashley. Because Suzanna and Daniel do a lot of work, my mom, the benevolent grandmother, takes care of Arianna during weekdays, and that means that her uncles take care of Arianna as well. We don't do quite so much, but we definitely play with her; she is absolutely adorable, no question. Julianne, being an athletic youngster (he's what, seven?) who loves cars, skateboarding, biking, etc., has steered towards Jordan a bit more, but we occasionally play a videogame or a game of badminton. Ashley, being older and more mature, is more my side. Checkers, chess, teaching me Spanish, all good. (Yes, Suzanna is an immigrant from Colombia, and is as thus fluent in Spanish; her mother, who lives in Canada and in Colombia alternately, actually has some difficulty with English. They have both taught the children a great deal of their mother tongue. I stick to English with all of Suzanna's family, because if I start speaking any of my very little Spanish, I trail off into French, which I am near fluent in.)  Speaking of Suzanna, she is awesome! She's very buoyant, very Latin. Everything is fun for her. Once, when I was babysitting Julianne and Ashley, Suzanna came home two hours later than expected, so I got home at two o'clock in the morning. "We're going to be in so much trouble!" But it was an adventure! And it was a damn fun one too; Nightville is, to be honest, Texas Chainsaw Massacre country, so when things don't go right, it gets pretty fun. When Suzanna brought me and Jordan to Julianne's birthday party (at their dad's in Saint John), we had more private jokes than you could believe possible. Suzanna rocks. Plain and simple. ^ ^  My father has three brothers: my uncles Allan, Glendon, and Ross. My mom has one sister, Barbara, who insists she be called Aunt Boo. My mother's mother is my only living grandparent. (My father's mother, much older, died last March. My papa on my mother's side died when I was very young, and I have only one memory of him. He was lying on his deathbed. I also remember the ambulance taking him away. My grandfather on my father's side died young in the 1950's.)  I recently learned that Uncle Allan has cancer, which Glendon's wife, Edna, died from a few years ago. I like Uncle Allan, and his wife Aunt Sheila. He is the closest of my uncles to me, and she the closest of my aunts, showing more interest than Ross or Glendon or their respective wives. (Glendon remarried). I very much hope this cancer proves to be one that can be treated.  My mother is awesome. She is of course a Newfoundlander, and as thus she is a master of speechcraft. Newfoundlanders entertain with words. It's in our blood. She currently has no profession beyond babysitting, but used to work as a chemist in Newfoundland and had a brief go as editor of the Kings County Record. But yes, she certainly is an entertaining person. She's buoyant as well, which may be why she and Suzanna enjoy each other's company so much. And she is, of course, a little bit ridiculous, outspoken, and eccentric. But I love her. ^ ^  And then there's Dad. He is a traveller, having been to such exotic locales as Borneo and Singapore, Thailand and Cambodia. (He was actually in Cambodia when the Americans under Nixon made their first 'incursion' there. There was some panic, and he escaped the country.) He also lived for a long time in the Yukon. His profession was for the longest time that of a journalist, but he is now a writer. He's a bit of a bore, to be honest. But he's okay.  So, that's the family. Hope you enjoy.

      I have a dilemma.  First, let me begin with my girlfriend, one Emily Lockhart. One might classify her as a goth, as she fits a lot of the stereotypes: red-streaked hair, dark makeup, black clothing, spiky wristbands, dark poetry. Being a former cutter only adds to the mix. (To those not in the know, cutters cut their flesh with razors and watch it bleed.) Granted, she is a very nice person, if a bit shallow at times - sometimes her being goth seems like a gimmick, like she goes out of her way to be one, so it's not natural.  I am going to add that Emily is ridiculously attractive, and if it were not for my incredible mental discipline, I would pounce on her in an orgasmic rage. I mean it. But I look at personality before looks, and in fact, when I used to think Emily a total bitch, it didn't even strike me that she had big breasts then, or that her hair was some of the coolest around. This goes for everyone. In any case, I cannot make love to her, though a part of me wants to. Really wants to.  I am not a goth. I am in fact a respectable young man, good grades, glasses, polite, short haircut. (Though the last is actually a recent, and unintentional, addition.) I am a writer, but whenever I've tried to do something 'gothic', I realize how incredibly idiotic the stuff is. (Spiderwebs, suicide, vampirism, spooky spooky!) So, in short, with my enthusiastic love of life and my to-the-eye conformist attitudes, one would not think this is the girl I'd be with.  In any case, I care for Emily, if you believe it. I really do. She's had a rough life. Her mother was a raging alcoholic, and Emily coped by going goth. Things are actually getting better for her as she has moved in with her father's family. As I mentioned, she used to be a cutter. She stopped. I've gotten to know her over the last year, and grown to like her, because she's funny, she's smart, and she's adorable. Recently, I asked her out. For all her faults, I love her.  But it is thrown into question as to whether she is the one. I am the type to believe in omens, and I was recently sent one. It was a fortunetelling, silly stuff, but it confirmed a suspicion I had a week earlier told myself was unfounded: that Emily will not work out.  Somehow I knew this. Emily is I think very sad, and I am happy. I almost think my happiness drives her deeper into sorrow, and this affects me, and makes me sad. But as soon as I think of something else, I am happy again. It's like a sadness of pity, an emotion of no substance. Being Emily's boyfriend makes her feel awkward almost, as I guess I'm so, well, normal - her first boyfriend was a 'vampire,' and her second a drunken hick who showered once every two weeks or so. Both mostly just tried to get in her pants. (I might want to, but I don't say anything. Besides, I morally couldn't knowing it probably won't work.) But I definitely make her feel awkward. I told her I loved her on the phone once, and she kind of freaked. I found it cute how the next day she subtly poked me to her own blog, where she talked about me having said that. Cute and sad.  So, we know it isn't going to work. But what if I drop her? She dropped the vampire freak, she dropped the fifteen-year-old alcoholic. But if I drop her, being the only normal person she's ever had a relationship with, what then? Perhaps she goes back to one of her exes, and she caves on their demands for a blowjob, the fucking perverts. In any case, how do I live with myself knowing I've broken this girl's dreams? Maybe I'm underestimating her, maybe I am being a sexist and assuming she'll fall apart without me. But I can't help it.  So that's it. Life sucks, doesn't it?
