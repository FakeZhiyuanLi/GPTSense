						   All knotted up Struggling against myself Trapped Unmoving Needing to get going But stuck in one place Tangled Want to be free But can't be released At war with myself There isn't anything left Let it all go Noone will know Get untangled Make yourself free Push forward and out And end this feeling

						   Had so little for so long Gotta get moving Life's just been on hold Gotta break out Put a dream back in my heart Getting a new start Where there was an empty well It has sprung anew Where there was no fire One burns brightly now Gotta get moving Gotta break out Finally got my hope back

						   Being ignored. The ultimate feeling of worthlessness. Not even being made fun of has the hate to it that being ignored has. How can you say you love me, yet ignore me. Like I am not even a person. The tears course down my face, but you never even look away from the TV. I guess later tonight - when you are feeling frisky - you may look my way. But until then here I sit and there you are and not a glance is exchanged. Once we thought we were the superior couple and now we are an anticouple. You are your own person and I am learning to become my own person. Now if only I would stop caring. Just let you ignore me and I learn to ignore you and it would be so much easier on me.  Being ignored. The opposite of being loved. To be made to feel you are not even worth the breath of hurting words. Yell at me. Scream at me. Cuss me out. Just look at me. Say anything to me. I feel like a child. I yell at you just so you will say something anything to me. I say its over. You say its not. You are not the one being ignored.  Being ignored. Kept out of the loop. What did they say on the phone. Nothing. What are you doing today. Nothing. Can you help me pick up the kitchen. Whatever. I've got to leave. Where are you going. I told you. They want me to come in. I am going to see them that I don't ignore. I can't stay here with you I ignore for one second longer. I cry. You walk out the door and yet you still say you love me.  Being ignored. Your words don't matter. Your life doesn't matter. Just say something, anything. Make me more important than something.  Care enough to yell at me. Care enough to hate me. Just care. Just stop ignoring me. I want to exist. I can't exist without you knowing I am alive. I will cry tonight and you won't know. I will die a little more tonight and you will not care.  Being ignored. The feeling that makes you want to die.

						   Dream a little dream Cry a little cry And it will all be better Will get better by and by. Don't let your hope go Tommorow will get better. Don't let them know You are ready to end it all. Dance a little dance Sing a little song And know that its true This world won't be long. Always keep your smile on Never let your frown in And it won't be long Until this hoplessness is gone.
