      I feel, neutered.  I used to be so mean, callous and just down right happy to inflict pain upon others. What happened? I can't anymore, even when people insult me all I can do is smile like it was funny or the like.  Why? I don't know, maybe I'm becoming more and more pious like I had always hoped I could be, but now finally being able to do it thanks to my unborn son and the anticipation I await him with.  I feel like I've lost who I am, but I'm comforted by the fact that I feel as if I have gained something much more special and much more meaningful.  Either way, I know if the situation calls for it I won't be nice... just hope that situation never comes.

      Been a few days since I've updated this.  Turns out, once again, the doctors which are helping my girlfriend and I along with our pregnancy were wrong yet again. Yes, our child is ok and growing as he should be. That was a relief.  Unfortunately, no good news comes without bad news, her father was diagnosed with colon cancer. His cancer is coupled with his diabetes, thus making it frightneningly like the things I've been through.  I've lost people in my life to both, and the thing that hurts me the most is the fact she's going to have to go through what I have in that respect. I only wish there was something I could do to prevent her from knowing such pain. She's such a good person, therefore seeing her in pain of any kind is almost unbearable.  For the first time, I seen her weep, it's something I wish to never bear witness to again. All I could do was sit there, trying to calm her down and help her focus on what needed to be done, meanwhile inside I'm screaming - wishing it was someone else causing her such pain so I would be able to end it for her, by ending them if need be.  Why is it, now of all times I'm unable to help the ones I love from being hurt.  It's almost ironic what I have become. Those of the past would gasp and look upon me astonished, wondering who I am.

      Lately it seems as if my competitive spirit has diminished completely. I feel much like a fully grown adult that has recently been neutered. Since day one, I have been extremely competitive and have kept it hidden from friends and family unconciously it seems. Recently however, I can't seem to get my head in the game so to speak, whether it be because of concerns of my girlfriend and our child or some unknown factor. Regardless, I'm losing constantly to people I should at least pose a challenge to.  The more I play, the worse I get. I know the game better then most, I know deep down inside of myself I can be one of the best, yet I still can not grow into the player I know I can be. Why is this?  Today, my girlfriend and I must go to the doctor - though this time is different then others due to the circumstances they believe our child is not growing properly as it should be. Then, Monday, we must go once again because they have concerns about the results of her sugar test. The last, only, sugar test came back with results saying her sugar was high and now we must do it again several times which means Monday will be quite a long day exceeded only by the longer wait we must endure for the results.  It seems almost as if every time something in your life starts to go well, something blindsides you. It's only when you aren't expecting something bad, that the worst comes. When you expect the worse to come, there is only happiness to be had.  Honestly, it feels like a test - a test that I must pass.

      I'm going to be a father, it's official and has been for several months now. My child is due October 28th and hopefully it will arrive healthy.  Words can not explain how I or any other expecting parent feel. There is no single word or even a myriad of words which possess the definitive meaning of what it feels like. If one was forced to describe the feelings, it would be a combination of: happiness, sadness, worrying, complete fear, and most of all hope.  Happiness, for the obvious reasons.  Sadness, for the reason that those lost will not get to see their great grandson, grandson, nephew, cousin, or the like.  Worrying, eternally it seems, wondering if I will be the father my child deserves. Wondering if I will be able to teach him the things I want and need to. Worrying if I will be able to convey to him the results of my experiences in life so he will have an upper hand in dealing with it and its common downtrodden times.  Complete fear, wondering if I am ready for fatherhood, despite the lack of a choice I now have. Fearing that he will grow up to despise me for some yet unknown reason.  Hope, hoping that I am everything he wants and deserves. Hoping that he is born healthy, which I know he will be. Hoping that I can give him everything he needs, and that he understands why I can't give him everything he wants.  I pray I can be the father for my son, that my father could never be for me.

      The title serves no purpose other then the fact that all that has happened on my LAN today is, yes you guessed it, network collisions.  I have no idea exactly how this blogging concept is supposed to work, my only guess is that it is nothing more then a public journal. Therefore, I'm going to treat it as such.  I'm currently getting prepared to begin my endeavor into what is known as 3D modelling. Ooh, aah. I've tried literally almost all methods of creating graphics digitally from the basic early form of text manipulation to the more recent high resolution interactive animations. I've always had an interest in level design, and recently I've come to have an interest in modelling thanks to  urlLink Blizzard's WarCraft 3: The Frozen Throne . Hopefully, all will go well.  I wish I could work for a company such as Blizzard designing games. Not only do they create quality games, they also have in my opinion some of the best art you will find in a game. The art direction they followed in WarCraft 3 and its expansion is quite possibly the most beautiful I've ever seen in a game.  It's quite depressing to have all these ideas that I have, considering I lack the motivation to ever carry them out, or at least try to tell others so that they may reap the benefits of my thoughts.
