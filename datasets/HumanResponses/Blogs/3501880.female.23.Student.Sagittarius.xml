       Reading:   Cases and Law Reviews for my Case Comment...Due Friday, sigh...    Listening to:   Radiohead's Ok Computer    Watching:   Uh, nothing...I have this fucking case comment to do...By Friday!!!      Dreams, Peeves, and Other Things   Lately, I have been having the strangest dreams, but my dreams last night and during my nap this afternoon have been the weirdest.  Last night, I dreamed that I was in this pool with Quentin Tarantino. We were underwater holding our breaths for some reason. Really, you should have seen how long we were able to hold our breaths. Quite Impressive. Then, I gingerly reach over to lightly brush my hand against his crotch. The gesture was so uncertain and tentative like someone going to put their hand on what they know is a hot stove. Then, in perfectly clear speech (bear in mind we are still underwater...really, the lung-capacity! Call the Guiness Book of World Records!), Quentin said, "No, go on! Grab it!" and I make the same tentative, unsure gesture. The next thing I know, we are in this sauna-type room with some other people. Quentin made some comment about how hot my boobs were, and I get extremely flustered, and have to leave the sauna. That was it....That was my dream!  I have read in several magazine interviews that Quentin is a bit of a manwhore. So, this had lead me to the question. If I had the chance to meet Quentin, would he sleep with me? I always seem to ask this question when I hear that a guy is a bit of a slut. It is like the official manwhore test: Would this guy sleep with me if the occassion arose?  This afternoon, I had a dream where I was on this cruise, and I kept having random encounters with this guy who I exchanged sexually-charged glances at everytime we passed each other. Then, I had this fairy godmother of sorts who tried to set us up, but in turn the guy ended up falling in love with the fairy godmother.   My conclusions about these dreams tell me that 1)I need to get laid and 2) My self-esteem is in the shitter, but really...did I need a dream to tell me this? It's common knowledge. Blah, I hate when dreams try to be all meaningful, and they aren't!

       Reading:  Studying for finals.   Listening to:  My dad lecture me about auto repair.   Watching:  My sanity go.   Mood:  Not very good. ____________________________________  I don't get sick very often. Sure, I get my trifling sniffles, my pesky coughs, my general miserableness that I usually label sickness. But otherwise, I am a pretty healthy person. However, I fear that I have angered the Gods of Inconvenient Sickness.  These Gods are normally docile and friendly folk, but they have a sick, twisted sense of humor. They absolutely get-off on seeing those who are busy, stressed, and pulling their hair out to fall under the curse of getting ill.   Some might say there are reasonable, medical explanations for such phenomenon. Experiencing prolonged stress and anxiety keeps the body in a state of readiness, which causes the immune system to not function at its best, and thus making the body more susceptible to disease and infection. Rubbish...  These Gods are close friends with the Gods who like to get really drunk and pee on mortals (i.e., rainstorms). They belong to the same fraternity, actually, which explains their warped sense of humor.   One of the ways I have angered them is my long history of getting out of obligations by lying about not feeling well. In high school, I would forge notes from my mother about doctor's appointments and how I could not attend school because I was sick. In college, I would not attend the majority of the semester, and then plead to the professor about all my health problems so I could make up the work and get a passing grade. In my various jobs, I would feign a stomachache just so I could spend the day at the bookstore, browsing and reading.  Now, when I need to be at my peak performance during finals as well as juggling a job and life's little errands, the Gods thought it would be real funny to throw a viral infection my way.   Oh, Gods, my lesson has been learned...

      Tomorrow, I have another therapy session. It is my last one with the nut-job therapist. Part of me really would like to cancel, but another part of me desperately hopes that THIS is the session we will hit the golden nugget of wisdom to spur the Gold Rush of Mental Health '04. But I know that this will not be the case.   I checked out the book he recommended to me last session. He described it as "a fun, enjoyable read with LOTS of useful information." This might have been true had I been fighting a problem with biting my nails too much or trying to swear less (though, I probably should fucking swear less).  The book turned out to be so trivial and condescendingly written, featuring case studies about how Ben Franklin became the wonderful American icon he was, and so I could I if I applied said principles.   Part of me just wants to tell him what a useful fuck he is, and how he has probably caused me more psychological damage rather than remedying the problems I already have. But as we all know, I will just spend the hour rambling about the exact same things I have already said in our past sessions, and he will just repeat what I said back to him. When our session ends, I will thank him for his help and leave. Then, when I see him around the office in the Fall to see my new therapist, I will smile politely, but think about how I wish his license would be revoked. The joy of Passive-Aggressive Behavior. ________________________________________  This last Friday, I met my friend, James, for dinner at our favorite "greasy spoon" diner. As we waited for a table, I noticed a young man waiting with his father. What caught my attention were the tangle of wires that protruded from his head and gathered together into a little pouch that he carried at his side.   I couldn't help staring. I just couldn't. Curiosity got the best of me, and I continually glanced out of the side of my eyes at the wires. What were they for? Could this be a new product by IGIA known as the "Portable Electro-Shock Therapy System"? Why just battle your shameful vices at home with Electro-Shock Therapy when you can do it on the go?  I tried to think of all the possible afflictions that would make such a treatment necessary, but then a strange thought occurred to me: What if this boy intentionally placed the wires on his head as a sort of social experimenat art installation? And though it probably isn't the case, this explanation seemed to make more sense than any other valid medical one. I can imagine more than a few people I know who would do such a thing in the name of art. What does this say about me and my circle of friends?

       Reading:  How to Lose Friends and Alienate People-- Toby Young   Listening to:  iTunes, bitch...   Watching:  The Seventh Seal   Mood:  An amalgamation of tired, productive, sick, and complain-y ___________________________________ Don't tell anyone, but I am in the law library working on a research project for my boss, and I really have no clue what the fuck I am doing. Top it all off, my throat hurts (but it's not strep), and my mind keeps wandering.   The good news: Talked to the financial aid lady about my aid for next year. I feared that I would probably have to borrow privately, which would require me to ask my dad to be a co-signer. I REALLY didn't want to do that at all. It is time for me to cut the apron strings, folks, which will require me to figure out how I am going to fund my way through school, without having to phone up my father and whine, "But, DDDDAAAAAAAAAADDD! I need MMMMMOOOOONNNNNNNNEEEEEYYYY!   Lo, the Gods happened to be smiling upon me today, and I found out that my financial aid package would not require me to borrow privately. Thank you very much! One step closer to taking care of shit by myself. *pat on the back*  Earlier, I had to run home to get my laptop and the charger for my cell phone, and I kinda absent-mindedly started backing out of the parking space. I checked...really, I checked behind me, but apparently there was a car speeding behind me, which I almost hit...The key and very essential point to this story is that I DID NOT HIT THIS CAR! I just almost did...  However, this bitch freaks out, slams on her brakes in the middle of the road, and gets out of her car, and starts walking over to mine. I notice that she is a law student as well, and I have talked to her a few times. Also, we have a few mutual friends. She starts screaming, "You almost hit me!!!!!" and then judging by the look on her face, she realized that she knew me as I said "Sorry". Very dramatically, she flips around and storms back to her car.   I understand she was mad. Hell, I would have been pissed off, too, and would have given the well-deserved finger. But, chill the fuck out and just keep driving. I am not sure what was accomplished by her getting out of her car to briefly yell at me when I didn't even fucking hit her car. She ended up just looking like a big-ass bitch, and my indifferent opinion toward her has been blemished. Not that my opinion should be worth preserving, but you get the point, it was just the dumbest thing I have experienced in awhile.

       Reading:  David Sedaris...Almost done!   Listening to:  Jay-Z's Hard Knock Life   Watching:  Bridget Jones's Diary   Mood:  I got skillz, yo! ______________________________________  First day of my new job yesterday. Mainly, it went well. It's different than all my previous jobs. Usually, I would spend the first two weeks at a job sitting there, watching someone else do things and then turn around and explain it to me. It would take me months to feel like I actually knew what the fuck was going on.  I don't feel quite this way at my new job. Granted, I have to be told about a lot of things and pointed in the right direction, but I realize that I got skillz. I can be given background information, maybe a few pointers in the right direction, and then I am off.   And yet, I don't trust my skillz. In previous jobs, I had someone breathing over my shoulder, letting me know if I did something right or wrong. In my new job, there really isn't a right or wrong answer. Or at the very least, my boss doesn't necessarily know what it is, and it is my job to find it. This is difficult, because part of me desperately needs the validation of, "you did it correctly" or "no, that was completely incorrect."  Overall, I like the work, and it will be useful, hands-on skills. The work itself isn't bad, it is the lawyers that accompanies it that I hate. I really don't care who is sleeping with who and all that "political" bullshit. But alas, that is why I get paid the big bucks!

      I am officially employed. I got the call this afternoon after being a bit crestfallen on Saturday when I was informed I would know about the position. Now matter, it's mine now! Ra Ha Ha Ha! I start tomorrow.  The benefits of this job: 1. It will give me legal experience 2. It pays...well! $12/hr. 3. I can stop twiddling my thumbs during my days out of boredom.  The negatives: 1. It is about an hour commute each way. 2. The guy is a bit of a goof.  Will keep you updated on how it goes...

       Reading:   In Touch and David Sedaris    Listening to:   Now That's What I Call Music 2    Watching:   Coupling, Season 2    Mood:   Euphoric  _______________________________________  Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there. I just wanted to say how much I LOVE my dad, and was thinking that I have the relationship with him now that I didn't think I could ever had. For many years, I found him downright asshole-ish, but I guess both of us have mellowed out over the years, and he makes me laugh and gives me a good kick in the ass when I need it. Thanks, Dad, and I love you!  ****  On a completely different note, and this is really something I should not be talking about in the same entry as my dad, but does anyone have tips for, um, shaving "down there"? I have been trying something new, I guess and I am not sure how exactly I can avoid the razor burn and irritation that it brings. I don't have money to wax either, so if anyone has any suggestions, please leave me a post. Gracias!

       Reading:   Self-Directed Behavior    Listening to:   the Smiths--The Queen is Dead    Watching:   Dodgeball *giggle*    Mood:   Frustrated  _______________________________________  Okay, call me crazy (no, really...call me crazy), but I thought the purpose of therapy was supposed to find constructive solutions to your issues. My therapy sessions seem to consist of me talking for an hour with my therapist just repeating back what I say to him in a slightly different way. I mean, I saw three different times today in my session, "I am not really sure what to do about X", which should prompt said therapist to say, "Well, I would suggest blah-de-blah-de-blah"...  Finally, I just finally had to say, "Can you give me some goddamn fucking solutions to my problem or are you just going to sit there like a gay fuck with your gay-ass gold necklace and make vaguely sexual motions with your fingers as you repeat back what I have said to you?" Okay, that's not what quite came out of my mouth, but I just wanted a direct fucking answer, and you know what his direct fucking answer was? "Here is a book that I recommend"...Surprisingly it was the Bible of Proper Telephone Time Management as recommended in our last session.   I hope to get a new therapist in the fall semester, cause this guy BLOWS hard!!!!!!

       Reading:   David Sedaris...God,  I am such a slow reader.    Listening to:  The glorious gurgle of my new 12-cup coffee pot.    Watching:   Coupling (the British version)...Not as funny as the Office.    Mood:   Four Hours of sleep tired.  __________________________________________  God, I am so tired. I am not sure what is going on with me, but for the last little while when I wake up, I have been getting really disoriented. Mainly, this manifests itself in  almost  using a beauty product for an unintended use. In the shower, I go to use my face exfoliator as shampoo. Several other times, I very nearly avoided using my face cleanser as toothpaste. Just know, I put a dollop of body lotion in my hand, and then in what felt like slo-mo, I brought my hands up to my hair, prepared to work the lotion through my hair. I feel like I am slowly losing my grip on reality.

      I am in love. No, not THAT kind of love. Not the kind of love that only exists in a Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan movie. It's the kind of love that America was built on: The Love of Things. Currently, I am materialistically in love with both lip gloss and coffee pots.    Lip Gloss:  Lip gloss and I have always had a flirty thing going on. I have always been in love with the idea of lip gloss, but for some reason, I could never fully commit to rigorous applications the stuff. I would buy a new lip gloss, use it a few times, and then toss it into the depths of my makeup bag. I'm not really sure what has changed. Perhaps it was the attacks on 9/11 or the war in Iraq that has forced me to put things a bit more into perspective. Thus, I find myself married to Burt's Bees Wax Lip balm. But of course I am not faithful, but rather a glorified polyandrist among lip balms. Usually, I like to apply a base coating of lip balm, and then give sloppy seconds to a nice fruity lip gloss on top. Sometimes, I prefer something with a bit of color. It just depends on my mood, and it's fickle.   Coffee Pots:  Coffee Pots and me merely have been friends for years. Strictly platonic. We would meet up at social occassions with friends, usually at Starbucks and the like. Sometimes we would hang out everyday, even multiple times a day. Other times, we wouldn't see each other for weeks, perhaps months. Gradually, things have become more serious. At the beginning of last year, I bought my own coffee pot that brewed just a single cup of coffee. It wasn't until around finals time last semester that coffee and I really became close. So close that I have upgraded to a 12-cup coffee pot. Now, that's love!

      I really should not be writing this entry, because I am so seething with anger it is guaranteed to be shitty. I got home this evening, only to find that my cat had been locked outside on the porch. No, he's not an outside cat. No, not even supposed to be on the porch WITH supervision. But, lo, the beastmaster locked the porch door with poor little Snicklefritz out there and GOES TO SLEEP! Out of spite and revenge, when her stupid, goddamn, ugly-ass cat tried to sneak into my room to eat MY cat's food, I chased it out. It tried to fake me out and duck between my legs to get to the food, but I wasn't fooled..I hate the beastmaster and her pre-cryogenic freeze Mr. Bigglesworth! H-A-T-E, Find out what means to me! Sock it to her, Sock it to her, Sock it to her!  Deep, Cleansing breath....ahhhhhhh! Okay, on to more pleasant topics: the interview. I think it went well, and I really hope I get the job for the reasons explained in my previous post. The guy kept on telling me how I was the first person he wanted to interview. Then went on to tell me how he got about 25 resumes in a day from people with extensive and impressive resumes (apparently, mine was neither extensive nor impressive, I gathered), but he really like mine, cause "It actually seems like I might want to be a lawyer" (had to suppress laughter on THAT one) and he liked me because, "I actually seem like a normal person..." I don't know. I felt good about it, but then I remembered one job that I interviewed for a few years ago and I thought I had it in the bag. I didn't get the job, but I think the guy just wanted to bag me, cause he sent me a creepy email after he told me I didn't get the job saying, "If there is ANY WAY I can help, just let me know..." Yeah, there was one thing...You could have given me the DAMN job!  So, anyway...Keep everybody posted as I should know around Saturday if I got it or not! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, I need the job!  One more quick note: Though I really don't care for basketball or most professional sports in general (with the exception of gymnastics and ice skating), I am secretly delighted that the Pistons beat LA in the NBA championship. My reason is that Karl Malone switched to the Lakers after spending his whole career with the Utah Jazz, just so he could have a chance at the Title before he retires (cause the dude is old, and practically plays with a cane!).  Well, Karl, you didn't get your ring, and now because you have deserted all your loyal fans back in Utah, you won't be getting any honorary street named after you like good, old John Stockton...Ah, the misfortunes of others.

       Reading:   The Nutritional Information on everything I eat    Listening to:   Butterfly Boucher's Flutterby    Watching:   My waistline get bigger    Mood:   Like Sally Struthers at an All-You-Can-Eat Buffet...  ______________________________________________  Oh fuck! Oh fuck! Oh fuck! I have an interview today, and an interview tomorrow (which I am hoping I get the job today, so I don't have to dodge bullets driving to Gary, IN for tomorrow's interview, but knowing my luck...   I am really excited at the possibility that I might get a job that 1) will give me some legal experience 2) give me a paycheck 3) won't require me to say, "Would you like skim or whole milk in your venti, double-shot latte?"  Bad News: I just tried on my only suit, and realized how fat I have gotten...I knew the suit had been a bit snug before, but I merely had to suck in the gut ever so slightly to zip up the pants. This time, I really could have used an extra pair of hands to get the zipper up. Let's just say that I am really glad that I don't have a cock, cause I even caught a little skin while trying to zip up the pants.   What does this mean? Diet time! I am officially cutting out McDonald's, ice cream, and other deliciously evil things out of my daily food intake. I will run consistently again. In fact, I have been running a lot more lately, but I think I pulled a muscle in my leg last week.   Since I am now Quaker (I promised that I would become Quaker if my financial aid check was ready today, and it was...so there you go, I'm a Quaker!), I promise to God to lose 20lbs if I get this job I'm interviewing today...And that the attorney has a fetish for chubby girls who have to squeeze to fit into their only interview suit.

       Reading:   A litte David Sedaris...    Listening to:   Crickets    Watching:   The second season of The Office...fucking brill    Mood:   Like one of Oprah's minnions... ___________________________________________  Today on the drive to class, I heard this song that I haven't heard in AGES. It is set to the music of "Everybody's Free" from the Romeo and Juliet soundtrack, and has some craggly old man dispensing advice about sunscreen. Well, I started to bawl when I heard it. I felt like such a pussy that cries at commercials for prescription drugs for gential warts (come ON! you do this too....There's NO CURE for herpes!), but the words just struck a nerve with me. So, here they are... ___________________________________________  The lyrics to Everybody's Free to Wear Sunscreen, by Mary Schmich: Wear sunscreen.  If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now.  Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.  Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.  Do one thing every day that scares you.  Sing.  Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.  Floss.  Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself.  Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.  Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.  Stretch.  Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't.  Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone.  Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's.  Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.  Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.  Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.  Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.  Get to know your parents. You never know when they'll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.  Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.  Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. Travel.  Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.  Respect your elders.  Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.  Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85.  Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.  But trust me on the sunscreen.

       Reading:   Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Demin by David Sedaris-- One of the few authors that make me laugh outloud.    Listening To:   iTunes Party Shuffle--Radiohead's "Paranoid Android"    Watching:   Definitely NOT  For the Love of the Game  with Kevin Costner    Mood:  Gluttonuous...I slept in until 1pm today!!!   _______________________________________________________  This last year, I have established a new standard of living for myself: I do not want to have a roommate unless we are fucking. No, this does not mean that I want to establish that kind of relationship with my roommate just so we can still live together (Ew!). Simply, if I have another roommate, it will be a live-in boyfriend arrangement.  I guess I have just come to a point in my life where the economy of having roommate does not outweigh the benefits of living alone. I feel too old to continue to have the same disagreements about doing the dishes, who took out the trash last, or when I can have guests over to the apartment. If I am to have these arguments, it better be offset by regular sex.  I have paid my respects to the Gods of Bad Roommates with the following roommates:   Chewy and Slappy:  My first apartment was at Utah State. I shared an apartment with five other girls, having only a bathroom with a shower and another with a toilet. I got along fine with most of my roommates, except for a pair of sisters that I soon dubbed "Chewie and Slappy".   Chewie got her name because she looked like, well, a wookie. A huge mane of pubic hair extended from her head, and had a propensity for leaving "Little Chewies" around various places in the apartment, namely the couch, the kitchen counter, and my least favorite place, the shower drain. One of my other roommates, Melanie, and I asked Chewie repeatedly to clean her hair out of the shower drain, and she would let out a low, mournful groan (a la Chewbacca), which we took as a sign of compliance. Yet, morning after morning, I would groggily make my way into the shower and find a "Little Chewie" greeting me in the drain. Melanie and I took a more drastic measure and made a sign that read, "Please clean your hair out of the drain!", posting it on the bathroom wall.  For greater emphasis, Melanie artistically embellished the sign by drawing little tufts of hair along the borders. Chewie either choose to ignore the sign or simply could not read, because a colony of "Little Chewies" continued to reside in the shower drain until the day I moved out.   Slappy originally proved to be more tolerable than her sister. She had been genetically blessed with a lack of fur, and actually was rather enjoyable to engage in discussions of literature, history, and philosophy. But Slappy could be moody. In fact, she had a wicked case of depression, and you never quite knew when it would make an appearance.   One day, Melanie and I decided to go over to our neighbor's apartment and make a prank call to our apartment. Slappy answered, and we conducted our prank, which cleverly consisted of us screaming "Hey! Shutup!" into the phone and hanging up. Okay, so it wasn't that clever, but I guess you had to be there. As Melanie and I sauntered back into the apartment, feeling very pleased with ourselves, Slappy (who had answered the phone) cornered me, administered a good slap on the face, and stormed off towards her room. Partly out of shock and partly not sure if she had been joking, I yelled back, "Hey, don't hit people, you hussy!". Slappy yelled something about our lack of maturity (well, she was right), and slammed her bedroom door.    I filed a complaint with our Resident Assistant, and Melanie and I wrote up a statement of the incident. As a result, Slappy got "a stern lecture" and was forced to write a letter of apology.  ******   Kathy:  When Kathy and I first moved in, we had been the only ones living in a rather large house that rented out rooms individually. Kathy had a strange look to her: she was about 5'3" and roughly 100lbs. I could not tell if she appeared to be either 35 or 12 (at the time, she was 24). Her favorite things included: Scooby Doo, Days of Our Lives, Sweet Valley High, Pepsi, chocolate cake, Lays potato chips, and large hunks of cheese. Her dislikes included: her stepmother, personal hygiene, telling the truth, and homosexuals.  Kathy was passionate about Days of Our Lives. I got the impression that she might have thought that the characters actually existed. One time, she came home about 10 minutes before the start of the show, and I was watching an episode of Maury.  Kathy: Are you watching that show? Me: yes Kathy:(looks shifty and nervous)Oh... Me:(silence) Kathy:(looks at her watch) Me:(pretending to be innocent) Is there something that you were wanting to watching? Kathy: (looks relieved) YES! (jumps up and changes channel to Days of Our Lives. She rocks back and forth to comfort her nerves.) Me: Oh, I hate Stefano! Kathy: That DAMN Stephano...Always ruining the lives of others!!!!  Another time, Kathy came home and engaged me in this conversation...  Kathy: Guess what I heard on the radio today! Me: What? Kathy: There is a SONG about SCOOBY DOO!!!! Me: Really? What did it sound like? Kathy: I don't know, it had something about Scooby Snacks! Me: Oh, you mean, LFO's "Girl on TV"? Kathy: I guess so! Me: Uh, that song isn't about Scooby Doo.. Kathy: I am pretty sure it is! Me: sure, okay...  The next semester, more people had moved into the house. The other girls became just as freaked out by Kathy as I was. One girl, Heidi, took up the habit of rummaging through Kathy's things for tangible evidence that Kathy was psychotic. During one of these snooping sessions, Heidi found that she had piles and piles of paper towels that she had rolled up and used as sanitary napkins, but never threw away.   In a way, I sort of felt bad for Kathy, as her mother died when she was a teenager. Her dad remarried and her stepmother treated her terribly. I had a theory that sometimes when people have a traumatic event in their lives, they sometimes get stuck in that time and never seem to progress emotionally and physically from that point on. That is why we have so many 50 year old women with large bangs and blue eyeshadow. I always thought this applied to Kathy. When her mother died, she became physically and emotional stunted, and that is why she loved her Scooby Doo, Sweet Valley High, Babysitter's Club, and Days of Our Lives so dearly. These things reminded her of happier times.   The last I heard of Kathy had been that she had been visiting the cemetery to try to talk to the dead. I am pretty sure she got this idea from Days of Our Lives, but the act landed her in a mental institution. Oh, Marlena would have been proud...  ******   Nora:  Nora had been one of my closest friends in college, and we ended up living together several times throughout the years. She really hadn't been that bad of a roommate, but sometimes her lack of common sense was irritating.   The most classic example was when she kept clogging the toilet. It wasn't that Nora took impressive dumps, but rather, she seemed to use about a half roll of toilet paper for even the littlest tinkle. As a result, she perpetually clogged the toilet.   The first time this happened, all of us had been caught completely offguard. We had no plunger, and no of us knew about the valve at the base of the toilet to shut off the water. Thus, the urine-filled water overflowed onto the floor and carpet in Nora's room until we procured a plunger from the neighbor boys. My favorite image burned into my memory is Nora standing in the tub trying to unclog the toilet with red, hot, tear-stained checks moaning, "Why did this happen to me?!?!?". She then asked if she could use some of my towels to soak up the carpet that had been saturated with her urine. I winced, but then brought her some of my crappiest towels.  Nora: I will make sure to wash your towels. Me: Don't worry about it, just keep them!  I would have thought that Nora might have learned from experience, but it hadn't been more than a couple weeks later when my other roommates and I stood in the kitchen chatting, and Nora came out crying, slammed her door, and said, "Why does this KEEP happening?"  Me: What keeps happening? Nora: The toilet! Roommate 1: Did you clog it? Nora: Yes Roommate 2: Did it overflow? Nora: Yes Roommate 1: Is it STILL overflowing? Nora: Yes Me: Want me to go get the plunger from the boys? Nora: NO!!! Me: Why not? Nora: Cause I don't want them to know I clogged the toilet! Me: I am going to go get the plunger... Nora: Just don't tell them it was me that clogged the toilet.  I walked over to our neighbors. My friend, Chad, answered the door. The first thing I said had been that Nora clogged the toilet. Chad replied simply, "Again?" and handed me the plunger that had been waiting by the door from the last time. Back at the apartment with plunger in hand, I surveyed the damage. This time, the overflowing toilet had chucks of fecal matter floating in urine-spiked watered. Also, because of Nora's inaction in resolving the situation, the mess had seeped out into the hallway and part of the living room.  Nora: Can I borrow some towels to clean up the mess? Me: Not a fucking chance.  I made Nora call our landlord to inform him of the problem and to clean up the mess, thinking he would have the carpet cleaned. Instead, a few days later, he shows up with a large fan to dry out the carpet. Call me crazy, but I am pretty sure that if I had rental property, I would not want to merely resolve fecal matter that had soaked into the carpet with a large fan.  ****  As a result of Chewie and Slappy, Krazy Kathy, and Nora and Her Magical Overflowing Toilet, I feel that I have gained the necessary life experience of eccentric roommates, and have come to the conclusion that the only eccentricities in the apartment should be my own or the person's whom I'm fucking.

       Reading:   Cosmo...satiating my love for beauty magazines.    Listening to:   This American Life    Watching:   Grown Men making asses out of themselves    Mood:   hermit-like   One of the few things that I unequivocally dislike is when stores have men dress up in animal costumes and pester customers. Really, I think if anyone had a desire to dress up in an animal costume, he better be a "plushie" and about to fuck someone up the ass in that costume.   But no, my stroll around Barnes and Noble today was disturbed by "Rusty", an undistinguishable animal mascot for a minor league baseball team in Gary, IN. I had to ignore him as he waved to me when I drove into the parking lot. I looked the other direction as he called out to me as I walked in the store. And I had to walk hurriedly away when he came up and violated my 3-foot personal space radius requirement while I had been browsing through books on a table.   It was like "Rusty" had sensed that I didn't want to be ANYWHERE near him, and then tried desparately to induce a smile and fit of giggles from me. I came to Barnes and Noble to look at BOOKS, not be harassed by a shitty animal mascot. "Rusty" should consider himself lucky that I didn't kick him square in his animal bits.

      Catching the tribute fever that has spread as a result of Reagan's death, I would like to pay my respects to my brother, Micah. Except he is not dead. I just haven't spoken to him in awhile, and realized today how much I missed him (yet apparently not enough to actually call him).  While making hot dogs for lunch today, I realized that my remaining hot dog buns had become stale. What makes a hot dog so good is because the dog is blanketed in some pillow-y bread. I panicked for a moment, because I didn't want to eat just plain hot dogs and almost threw the weiners in the trash (which would have been upsetting, because they were Hebrew National hot dogs, and it probably would be sacriligious to throw away things that have been blessed by rabbis, and as a result, would have angered God).  Then, I remembered a little known family recipe that my brother created called "The Taco Dog". The Taco Dog is pretty much what it sounds like: a hot dog wrapped in a tortilla shell. When my brother first suggested the idea for the Taco Dog, I had been skeptical. In fact, I've never been a great proponent for mixing different types of cuisines (Supposively that makes me a "food purist" or perhaps a "foodist"). But, lo, I kicked down my mental prejudices about keeping food "separate but equal" and began to integrate. Much to my surprise, the Taco Dog turned out to be GOOD and extrememly versatile. I experimented with different types of toppings put on the Taco Dog, and discovered that my favorite was the Asian-Inspired Taco Dog (a taco dog with hoisen sauce).  Thus, this afternoon, amidst my hot dog bun crisis, I pulled out the old Taco Dog, and even improved it by using two hot dogs in one tortilla, because it has been well-established that any sandwich is better with double the meat (the obvious exception being the Double Filet-O-Fish).  My brother has gone on to develop other sandwich sensations, but none have been met with the same popularity and critical acclaim as the Taco Dog. The Chicken Salad Cordon Bleu (a chicken salad sandwich, topped with a slice of ham and swiss cheese) was received with mixed reviews. And despite the catchy name of "the China Muffin Crunchwich" (a toasted English muffin with crunchy Chow Mein Noodles), the public never fully embraced it, and felt the sandwich "a tad dry."  Despite his recent failure, Micah shall be remembered to his successes in developing the Taco Dog, and the joy it has brought many.

        Reading:   Peter Sellers' bio...god, He was a fucking mama's boy, but I still love him     Listening to:   My mix with all the songs that remind me of when I was in Europe    Watching:   Stepford Wives...5:15pm showing    Mood:   wrothy...pissed at my professor, cause we had a make-up class today, but when I get to school, the building had no power either because of the wicked storm last night or out of respect for Reagan. After standing outside for 20 mins (having to watch the Beastmaster rock back and forth), my prof. informs us that we are conducting class in the clubhouse of a GOLF COURSE about 10 mins away. Of course, I am frightfully low on gas, so after speeding to quickly fill up and grab some MUCH NEEDED coffee, I drive around for 20 mins. trying find the place, and could not    I must be missing Utah lately, cause it has been on my mind lately. Possibly because I am still getting used to having a film of sweat because of this damned humidity. Never thought I would wish for my skin flaking off again.  If anyone is planning to move or visit Utah in the near future, be sure to check out the following survival tips.   Useful Phrases and Vocabulary    Oh My Heck : What the Fucking Hell!   Jesus Jammies : Mormon Underwear. Upon getting married or leaving for a mission, a person has their "endowments" taken out. This, in effect, means that they now have to wear the most disgusting and un-sexy pair of underwear, consisting of knee-length shorts and a t-shirt made of a filmy, synthetic fabric. Bra and underwear are worn OVER the garments. Rumor has it that garments feature a "love hole" so Mormons don't have to take them off to have sex or rather "make babies".   "You're a Special Spirit" : Usually said proclaimed by a girl who is dumping a guy and means to say that she wouldn't even with someone else's cooch.   Helpful Hints   1. If you are minority, avoid visiting Utah. People in Utah usually don't like to see anyone of a particular ethnicity other than white unless they are cleaning their houses or serving them food, and even then, they guard their purses/wallets a little more carefully.  2. Bring Extra Beer Money. The beer in Utah is watered down to 3.2% alcohol.  3. Refrain from swearing in public unless you like being scowled at by strangers.  4. Be sure to take pictures of hoardes of polygamist women. You can identify them, because they are the ones wearing long, frumpy skirts with tapered jeans underneath and hair tightly wound in buns. They like to hang out at the DMV or other bureaucratic institutions for some unknown reason.  5. Watch out for the following interaction: You: Oh, Jesus Christ! Them: Where?  6. Sundays are the best days for shopping and hitting the malls...everyone is in church.  7. Beware of the screaming children. Utah Law requires that each public establishment must have at least one misbehaving child on the premises at ALL times.  8. Go to the Mormon Temple Visitors Center to check out the oversized Jesus statute. For some reason, it reminds me of the Jesus statute in  Dogma  giving the thumbs-up!

      I have never had a particularly close relationship with my grandfathers. My family moved every few years, so we never really saw them much. My grandfather on my dad's side died last March. He was good for a few good laughs. He wore his pants up to his armpits. He used a walker and would always scrape it against the wood floor as he walked, so you could hear him coming from far away reminiscent of a horror movie soundtrack that foreshadowed impending doom. Also, he almost drowned me at my baptism when I was eight. My grandfather on my mother's side resides in Montana had occassionally drives down with my grandma to visit my parents. He likes to make comments about the damn environmentalists and how I will make a "real, good wife" some day. So, in spite of a sense of the obligation to love one's extended family, the bond is somewhat lacking.  A saavy business proposition would be a store called "Rent-A-Grandparent"...It would have the same premise as a "Rent-A-Center" in which you can rent televisions or furniture with the option of owning. A person could choose a grandparent to suit his or her own mood. Let's be honest, sometime one fancies the jovial grandpa reminiscent of Santa Claus and other times, one desires a bawdy old fart.  I already have my eyes set on my potential grandfather. He "taught" my Contracts course. I use the term "taught" loosely, because the course consisted merely of his anecdotes about how the best haircut he ever received took place under a tree in Nigeria or how he has all his suits custom-tailored in the Phillipines.  More intriguingly, I reveled in the stories that my fellow students related to me. One of my classmates happened to pull up next to our professor at a stop light, and they ended up drag-racing together. My professor, with pipe in mouth, decisively won the match-off.  Another time, my professor had been walking into class carrying approximately eight bottles of wine in his arms (Keep in mind, we have a no-alcohol policy on our campus). All of a sudden, the bottles slip out of his arms and all but one crash onto the floor. My professor stood with a disappointed look on his face and remarked, "Aw, my wine" and walked into the classroom, leaving others to clean up the large pool of glass and wine.

      I find it sad that my biggest accomplishment this week has been uploading my CD collection into itunes. I am not even sure that I shall eventually purchase an ipod sometime in the future? Though, I will sleep with someone if they buy me one! Also, I will sleep with anyone who will buy me a ticket to Europe and give me spending money this summer. Please????

       Reading:   Us Weekly! It came a day early.    Listening to:   Outkast, "Roses"    Watching:   The last night of E!'s 101 Hollywood Secrets    Mood:   intelligentsia...sorry, that isn't really a mood, but whatevs, yo!    "Life's Not Living Without Tiramisu"--Camryn Manheim  I not sure many blog entries get off to a good start by quoting Camryn Manheim, but what the hell.  Coming from a long line of guilt-ridden worriers, I am constantly thinking about how I need to improve my life. I need to eat healthier, exercise more, spend less, save more, don't drink, don't smoke (while drinking), read the newspaper and classic literature more, etc. etc. The list goes on indefinitely.   Recently, I came across a guy on the internet--okay, I had been browsing match.com--who seemed like a real health nut. I quickly crossed him off my potential dating list for this reason, because I not sure I could commit myself to a man who does not like a healthy portion of vice in their life.   Then, it like hit like Richard Simmons in an airport--I don't like living without a healthy portion of vice in my life. A few years ago, my mom imposed a low-carb diet regime on the family (before the Atkins craze), and I had been miserable. I felt cranky and bitchy and basically I would have performed circus tricks for a piece of bread. Truly, there are few things I like more in this life than gorging myself on cookies, cakes, ice cream, pizza, and hamburgers.   I really don't like maintaining a regular exercise rountine, because basically, I hate being sweaty. It is bad enough feeling obligated to shower once a day, so naturally I detest the idea of having to do it more than once. (Of course, it would be unreasonable to think that I might get up earlier than normal to exercise in order to facilitate having to shower only once during the day).  If I want to have rampant, unprotected sex with strange men in odd places, then you know what? Fuck off, because I am going to do it anyway. Also, what the hell is the big deal about using dirty needles to shoot-up? Seriously, I just think people are being germaphobes about that.

      Recently, I decided to give internet dating a try. This mishap occurred one day as I happened to be browsing the personal ads on Match.com and spotted what I thought could be my potential soulmate (two words: "bowtie" and "porn"). After long sessions of whining to my friends ("But he's ppppeeeerrrrrfect for me!"), I took a deep breath and paid the $25 subscription so I could email him. Alas, he never responded to my perfectly-crafted email that I spent hours writing (I am thinking of sending him a bill through paypal for the subscription fee). However, this is not the story of my recent failures of internet dating. Instead, I take you all the way back to 1998 in Logan, Utah to spin a tale of lust, yearning, desire, and well, stalking and lunancy, too.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I give to you... First Bass   During the Spring of my freshman year at Utah State, the school sponsored an event called, "Poetry and a Beverage". My friend, Jo, invited me to go see her brother's new band play at the event (so really, it should have been called "concert and a beverage").    The band took the stage, and my eyes drifted to the bass player. Angelic music floated down from the heavens as cherubs danced sprightly around him. Like my own bass-playing, causasian, rhythm-lacking Rickie Martin! I leaned over to Jo and asked if his name was Jesus, because I was in heaven (okay, not really).  During one of the breaks, I kept my eyes focused on Christ...I mean, Chris...his name was Chris, and noticed him speaking with a girl in the crowd. Not just talking, but I notice he had been, you know...leaning. I made a photographic image of this girl and burned it into my brain so I could kill and destroy later. As I did this, I noticed Chris writing something on her hand, and then added a mental note to torture her a little before killing her. hee.  The concert continued, as I switched back and forth between undressing Chris with my eyes and giving that bitch in the crowd the death stare. Following the concert, the gang gathered at Village Inn for a late night snack and what do you know...that fucking bitch popped up in the seat across from me. Noticeably scrawled across her hand had been a phone number and the letters C-H-R-I-S.  So naturally, I memorized it and stored it right next to my Death List Five.   The next day, I whined to my roommates about how great Chris had been ("But he's pppeeeerrrrrfect for me!")and confessed that I had memorized his number off that hussy's hand. My roommate, Melanie, at the time worked for a telephone survey company, so we concocted a plan in which she would call his number and pretend that she wanted to give him a "survey". In this "survey," she would slyly inquire what it "means" to if a guy writes his number on a girl's hand....flawless, right? Well, no, becuase it turns out that after about 5 minutes, Melanie revealed the real reason behind the phone, and then I got on the phone to speak to him. The conversation went surprisingly well. (He was a history major, like me. He was a military brat, like me. He had a cock, not like me.)In the end, we arranged to meet at his band practice the next week.  The week leading up to our "date" I spent in full-throttle obsessing. I could hardly eat. I could hardly say anything that did not pertain to either Chris or our date. To say the least, I thoroughly annoyed everyone.   Finally, the big day arrived. I arrived with Jo and her brother at band practice. Chris hadn't appeared yet, so I made myself comfortable on the couch and practiced my "effortlessly sexy" look. Five minutes later, he still had not arrived. Thirty minutes later, I thought he must have just been running really late. The night dragged on, and after two hours of band practice, it dawned on me that Chris had stood me up...at his OWN band practice. I tried to maintain a dignified demeanor, but it had been clear to everyone that I was embarassed and crestfallen.  Now, at this point, a normal person would probably chalk the date up to a loss, and move on. However, I am not a normal person. I still obsessed about Chris. Why didn't he show? He must have been really sick. Or in a car crash. Or, possibly, dead!   A month passed with no word or explanation as to what exactly did happen to Chris. One day, while lounging around at Jo's apartment, she received a phone call. She kept shooting me glances and it soon became apparent that Chris occupied the other end of the line! He had gotten Jo's number from her brother and called to apologize to me. He said that he had been really sick the night we arranged to meet (I told you so!), and just hadn't gotten around to calling me. I felt nothing, but elation! Again, we arranged to meet at his next band practice, and he PROMISED that he would actually show this time.  The day arrived. I headed over to Jo's once again to prepare for the big date, and as I brushed my teeth and talked excitedly to Jo about the impending date, I accidently swallowed toothpaste. After spending the rest of my preparation time dry-heaving over the toilet, we headed off to band practice. I still felt very nauseous from a mixture of toothpaste and nerves, but I attempt to put my best foot forward. I ended up tripping. I froze up and couldn't even speak to Chris. Feeling sick and so nervous, I could only respond in mono-syllabic words when ever Chris tried to speak to me. After failing to communicate with the dumb-mute, he merely thanked me for coming to band practice and went back to strumming on his bass, and I left.  The last I heard about Chris several years later had been that he got arrested for grand theft auto and a dishonorable discharge from the Air Force. Perhaps it had been divine intervention that I swallowed that toothpaste.

       Reading:   The Hipster's Handbook...I am only 67% hipster    Listening to:   NPR...I'm smart, goddammit! I'm smmmmmaaaaarrrrrtttt!    Watching:   E! 101 Hollywood Secrets    Mood:   amaroidal   Well, I'll be damned! There IS such thing as an artificial sphincter.   An artificial sphincter consists of three parts:  A cuff that fits around the bladder neck (or anal canal for the artificial rectal sphincter)  A pressure regulating balloon  A pump that inflates the cuff   To treat fecal incontinence, the cuff is placed around the anal canal. To use the sphincter, the person will compress (squeeze) the pump to divert fluid from the urethral (or anal) cuff to the balloon. This action will allow the sphincter to relax so that the person can urinate (or defecate). The cuff will then re-inflate on its own in 3 to 5 minutes (10 minutes for the artificial rectal sphincter.  However, it does not appear that the need for an artificial sphincter arises from excessive anal sex (sorry, James!).

       Reading:  Peter Seller's biography...It got put on hold with the writing of the case comment and the arrival of Mental Floss.    Listening to:   NPR...trying to win the heart of Mo Rocca.    Watching:   The vile, allergy-inducing tufts of cotton floating in the air.    Mood:   Like a cat napping in a patch of sunlight.   Hee. I just tried to set my radio to NPR, and I accidently put it on an Evangelist Christian station, and didn't realize it until after 10 minutes of listening to it.   Sometimes, I find that my leg positioned in such a way where it looks like I am an amputee. Other times, it seems like my extremities really aren't apart of my body. This leads me to imagine that my body is like a giant robot with a very little person sitting behind a large control panel, executing her will. Just something to think about...

      I really love this article about Paris Hilton and the making of her new movie,  House of Wax . Read for yourselves...  "It's, like, really cold and last night we were shooting at this sugar mill and it really smelled bad. And I didn't wear shoes, like, I don't know."  Continues the beleaguered Paris, "We're in the middle of nowhere and there's bugs everywhere. Everything's real. I'm actually running through a forest with bare feet -- it hurts. I've done my own stunts, like falling. I hurt my knee -- it was bleeding. But it looks good, so it's worth it."   Hilton, who returns to the small screen on June 16 for the second season of "The Simple Life," co-stars in the horror flick with hotter-than-hot up-and-comers Elisha Cuthbert ("24") and Chad Michael Murray ("One Tree Hill"), but she knows all eyes will be on her.   "I definitely think people are going to be, like, looking at me more than they would if I wasn't, like, so . . . ," she tells the Sydney Morning Herald before losing her train of thought. "I can't explain it. But I do a good job and I'm really looking forward to people seeing I'm good. It's not fair but life's not fair, so . . ." So ... what?

       Reading:   ack! SHOULD be reading for my class in 4.5 hrs which I am assigned to speak in today. Again, another day in law school where I will come across as a complete and utter dumbass!!! Not unlike the day in Torts last semester when my prof. called on me and I just hid behind my laptop as the rest of the class turned around to stare at me and laugh.    Listening to:   My iTunes Party Shuffle...Right now, Justin Timberlake--Like I Love You. If only he did...    Watching:   Daydreaming of running away to Chicago and becoming a call girl...They make GOOD money, and probably have more self-respect than lawyers.    Mood:   Argh...   I am a sucker for questionnaires that require me to subject my friends to the innerworkings of my mind! Rahahahaha! So, here we go...  *I stole this from someone else's blog*   1. Do you try to look hot when you go to the grocery store just in case someone recognizes you from your blog? No one would recognize me from my blog, cause no one reads my blog. Considering most days it is a chore to even shower, I have to say, "No, not really..."  2. Are the photos you post Photoshopped or otherwise altered?  Sigh...Unfortunately, I wished they were Photoshopped.  3. Do you like it when creeps or dorks email you?  I love with ANYONE emails me!  4. Do you lie in your blog?  No, but maybe I will start.   5. Are you passive-aggressive in your blog?  Come on, I am the Queen of Passive-aggressive...Just ask my dad!  6. Do you ever threaten to quit writing so people will tell you not to stop?  No, but rather I threaten that I will keep on writing...  7. Are you in therapy? If not, should you be? If so, is it helping?  YES!!! Just seem some of my previous entries...June 2 and 3rd, I think!    8. Do you delete mean comments? Do you fake nice ones?  No, but I have to tell my friends that they must leave a comment.  9. Have you ever rubbed one out while reading a blog? How about after?  Uh, I guess not  10. If your readers knew you in person, would they like you more or like you less?  Probably less...I complain...A LOT!   11. Do you have a job?  No...But if my dad asks, I really am trying to look for one  12. If someone offered you a decent salary to blog full-time without restrictions, would you do it?  Hell yeah!  13. Which blogger do you want to meet in real life? None, cause that would seem creepy and stalker-ish  14. Which bloggers have you made out with? mmm...making out with bloggers. I don't know anyone else in person who blogs.  15. Do you usually act like you have more money or less money than you really have?  Probably more.  16. Does your family read your blog?  I don't think so, cause I haven't told them about it  17. How old is your blog?  a week--two weeks, maybe  18. Do you get more than 1000 page views per day? Do you care? Ha!  19. Do you have another secret blog in which you write about being depressed, slutty, or a liar?  No, but I have always wanted to keep a fake journal, just to fuck with my descendents' heads!  20. Have you ever given another blogger money for his/her writing? No, I am poor!  21. Do you report the money you earn from your blog on your taxes? You can earn money from a blog?  22. Is blogging narcissistic?  Like a fox!  23. Do you feel guilty when you don't post for a long time? Yes, but I just feel guilty about everything  24. Do you like John Mayer? NO! I never want a man telling me my body is a "wonderland"...How fucking creepy.  25. Do you have enemies?  Apparently, but only because the Beastmaster spreads vicious lies about me to people.  26. Are you lonely?  I am a solipsist.  27. Why bother?  I usually don't!

       Reading:   Nothing...Avoiding my reading for class tomorrow    Listening to:   the Smiths--Strangeways, Here We Come    Watching:  Eurotrip *shrugs*    Mood:   Light-headed and sneezy...There are large tufts of cotton circulating in the air...Damn allergies   Oh, I have been having terrible escapist fantasies. I dream of quitting law school and running away to Chicago and having nothing to do with the law at all! N-O-T-H-I-N-G! But alas, my sister talked me back down to reality, and then reaffirmed my fear that my dad would probably never speak to me again! Well, of course he would speak to me again, but it would would probably only be to yell at me.  J.Lo has run off and gotten married...AGAIN! This is really something that I will never understand. At this point, how does J.Lo say her vows with a straight face? Does the minister not even require her to say "I do", but merely requires that she shrug as a sign of affirmance? It really just baffles me. I can see getting perhaps getting married again after divorce, but after my second divore and not having maintained a marriage for longer than two years, I think I would probably hold off just a little bit before I took the plunge again!   I need to go lie down. I am feeling light-headed again...boo!

       Reading:   Still working on Mental Floss    Listening to:   The guy who lives below me talking in a baby voice to his cat    Watching:   Wet Hot American Summer (with hot dogs and popsicles courtesy of the Newmans    Mood:   A bit hung-over, really   Official Statement of Apology: I just realized that every one of my entry titles ends with an exclamation point. In the hours of my wasted time, I have created a sort of personality test based on an individual's use of punctuation. By using excessive exclamation points, this indicates to me that I like to get my point across, but lack the ability to convey my ideas effectively in words. Also, it indicates that I secretly desired to be a cheerleader in high school.  Sidenote about the Guy and his cat living below me: A few weeks ago, I heard the sounds of a cat meowing wafting up into my bedroom window. Given my penchant for wanting to rescue stray animals (despite never ACTUALLY rescuing a stray animal), I look out my window and find a cat sitting in the grass. I rush downstairs, and as I open the door, it runs inside the building. Success! Then, quickly behind it is some toothless schmoe with a cigarette dangling precariously from his mouth, who says to me, "Oh, I wondered where my cat went", as he scoops the cat in his arms and scurries off. Strange...  Hurrah! President Reagan DIED! Finally, he kicked the bucket. I sort of revel in the passing of ex-presidents. It just feels like such a milestone, especially since Reagan was the first president during my lifetime. Beginning to feel old...

       Reading:   Ahhh...Latest issue of Mental Floss    Listening to:   the Smiths--Louder than Bombs    Watching:   Manhattan and Suspiria--yay! Netflix    Mood:  Overjoyed! The Case Comment is done!   With about a half-hour to spare, I finished my Case Comment for the Law Review Competition and rushed it over to school. For a moment, I was a bit disheartened by exactly how MANY people had submitted a case comment, but then I realized that I am just happy that I did it, as up until Wednesday, I wasn't completely sure if I would actually get it done.  Tonight, I have my friend Kim's Luau, and I really don't want to go, but at the same time, I am going, because a lot of my friends are leaving for Europe on Monday, so it will be the last time I see them before school starts again. The Beastmaster will be in attendance, and she just bugs the shit out of me, so I would actually rather stay at home and drink alone with a few good movies, but alas...society calls!  I am not really sure what it is lately, but people seem to keep running in front of my car! Really, they must have some sort of death wish, because it isn't like a panicked-sort of "oops, my ball just flew into the street" kind of run. It's, well, not even running at all, but rather a leisurely stroll into the street as my car keeps hurdling at 40MPH toward them.   A few weeks ago, I accidently bought a $4.50 tin of mints. By "accidently", I mean that I certainly would not have purchased them had I known beforehand that they were that expensive, but was too embarassed to ask the cashier to void the sale (because it was my only item of purchase). So, I thought that they would be extra good mints to warrant a price of $4.50, but no! They take the title of "The Poor Man's Altoid"...except you can't be poor if you want to buy them. Perhaps it is a specially-marketed mint aimed to the Nouveau Riche to make them think that they have taste because they buy expensive mints, but they can't tell that they are cheap mints, cause they don't have any "refined tastes"...hmmm, maybe that is what the "Gatsby-Approved" label on the tin means?

       Reading:   Sigh...Case Comment    Listening to:   My Yahoo Radio Station. After many hours of rating songs, I think I have finally perfected my radio station!    Watching:   Still nothing--Working frantically on Case Comment! (Due tomorrow at five...eke!)    Mood:   Productive, as the sooner I get this case comment done, the sooner I get to read the latest issue of Mental Floss that arrived in the mail today! (Oh, how the gods tease me...)   I have just recently switched therapists, as you all are probably aware that my old therapist no longer works there. Not entirely sure how I feel about this new guy. I just don't think he gets it. My last therapist never tried to push those stupid pamphelets with titles like, "Procrastination and You!" or "Feeling Anxious about Anxiety?"...They are stupid, and just contains information that I have heard a millions times before but never seems to work. New Therapist spent 10 minutes photocopying all this shit that he asked me to take home, read over, and decided which works best for me. He said, "I am throwing A LOT of new information out you, so just sort of skim and pick and choose a few ideas to try for our next meeting."  Well, here is the one suggestion that I choose, or also known as "The Sixth Commandment of Time Management":  "USE TELEPHONE PROPERLY: Prepare for each call. List call points you want to cover. Keep brief and to the point"  THANK FUCKING GOD! The key to unlocking MY LIFELONG PROBLEM of procrastination! Apparently, I can't get anything done because I am not planning out my phone calls! I must prepare a script of what I am going to say before every call. My question is what happens when people call me? Should I ask them to hold or if I can call them back, and quickly prepare a script of our telephone conversation? Why doesn't the Sixth Commandment of Time Management address this issue?

        Reading:   Ugh, Case comment stuff...     Listening to:   The sound of one hand clapping...     Watching:   Nothing, again...working on Case comment     Mood:   Bittersweet (symphony?)    I suppose that today was the last day of school for those in K-12, cause the streets were littered with wandering children! Seriously, I am from Utah (otherwise known as the child-producing capital of the Western Hemisphere!), and have never seen a sight like this. I mean, if you drive by schools in Utah, you would see hoards of children, but the children in this town were nowhere near any schools. They were just wandering in large packs along main highways. I felt like I might hear the sound of David Attenborough in my head, quietly explaining the migratory patterns of these children.   I near ran my car through a group of these children, not through any negligence of my own (I swear, I have had Torts, so I know!), but because the kids in this town have a strange habit of hanging out in the middle of the street with complete disregard for on-coming traffic. They are like cattle on some country road in Bolivia! Really, I hope the rest of the summer isn't comprised of me trying to dodge children on the streets with my car.   I just got back from my appointment with my therapist. This is the second time that we have met since my old therapist left (oh! How I miss her...). I guess I just need to build more of a rapport with him, cause he does that goddamn technique where he just stays quiet, and of course, I get uncomfortable with a silence of more than 3 seconds, so I just start rambling even more until 15 minutes later I make the conscious decision of not talking until he says something! I hate when people do that...manipulate me into taking with their silence. Boo...

Mood:   Tired from helping Monica and James move to their new apartment today. Payoff? They're going to help me move into MY new apartment in a few months!   Woo Woo! A Federal District Judge today struck down the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban as unconstitutional! Take that, you evil fetus-loving conservatives.  This lead Monica and me to discuss the legal basis behind the constitutionality of partial-birth abortions as well as gay marriage. Both of us obviously feel that both should be supported, but as far as developing a legal argument as to why these should be protected freedoms, we had a bit more difficulty reconciling. American Law is, of course, based off the Constitution and the courts use stare decisis in order rule on legal matters before it.  It goes without saying that there isn't much precedent for supporting these issues, and the constitution does necessary have a lot of evidence that would indicate that these should be fundamental rights. Hmmm...I must research this a bit more.

      I have a new friend at work. It's an ant. A solitary ant. I am endeared toward this ant, cause they usually live in colonies and hang out with other ants, but this one seems to have said, "Fuck it! I want to  live alone and write the Great American Novel".  Every day, the ant ventures out from behind some boxes to visit me. He usually scurries around my chair for a little while or sometimes he likes to sit on the top of my foot for ahwhile, until I shoo him away. He keeps me entertained and I provide the occassional companionship that he needs. I suspect it might be the perfect relationship.  ******** At the grocery store, I ran into a guy that I go to school with. I offered the requisite pleasantries, and in turn, he ended up telling me about how his wife had just walked out on him. I felt bad. He is eyes were obviously bloodshot, and he had a distinc air of dejection about him. Which brings home the fact that law school has managed to destroy all relationships that I know of, and this makes me a little bit sad.

Maybe these were all former Wham! fans or something, I don't know, but it was kinda creepy.

      I have done it! It has only taken me approximately 6 weeks, but I have FINALLY broken into the inner circle of secretaries at work!&nbsp; Okay, so there are only two of them, but up until last week, we really only have exchanged pleasantries as I have been coming and going from my corner "office". But now, they like to come back and talk to me and we use naughty words like "cunt" to describe the clients and things.   Within a short time, they have already told me how funny I am and how they are going to miss me when I go back to school next month. I love it when my ego is stroked so.

      I just wanted to apologize to everyone for the years that I insisted on lining my eyelids in black eyeliner. I always thought it looked cool and gave me a "smoky eye" look. I haven't picked up my black eyeliner in months and months and months, and just the other day, I whipped it out of old time's sake.&nbsp; God, it looked like shit! It just seemed to be way, way, WAY too much!   So....I'm sorry! I never fully realized how awful it looked. But, alas, I have realized the error of my ways!

      In browsing some different blogs lately, I have seen numerous "100 things about me" lists.&nbsp; As I go batty over making lists, here is my contribution.  100 Things about Me:  1. I am doing this list to avoid working on my Law Review Editing job. 2. I secretly am in love with Justin Timberlake, but I am even more secretly in love with Joey Fatone. 3. If I could chose only one dessert that I could have for the rest of my life, it would be ice cream, provide that I wasn’t limited to my choice of flavors. 4. I keep flipping back and forth between acting like I am 12, feeling like I am 35, and only really being 22 years old. 5. For the most part, I think Dr. Phil is right (ducks various rotten fruits being thrown at me). 6.One of my favorite activities is going to a matinee movie by myself. 7. I usually select my choice of matinee movie based on whether there is a hot actor in the movie. 8. Sometimes I wish I was a pretentious New Yorker, who came from a society family and went to Yale, where I discussed High-Falootin’ things like Proust. 9. Other times, I just I wish I was crazy even to be on Jerry Springer and have chairs thrown at me in front of a live studio audience. 10.I am in an abusive relationship with my cat. I know he loves me even though he bites and scratches me a lot. I think I bring it upon myself… 11. I really hate spending money on food. I love to eat, but I hate spending money on things that I have to throw out if they go bad before I get around to eating it or when I do eat, it is gone forever and I just have to buy more of it. 12. I wish my life were like a Sitcom and I magically had a different outfit to wear everyday. 13. I have an intense attraction to foreign men. 14. I have a secret fantasy where I fall in love with a Norwegian fisherman and spend the rest of my days in a Norwegian fishing village in the Fjords cooking stew and reading. 15. I always want to know what others say about me behind my back, but am terribly frightened of it at the same. 16. I am very, very, VERY irritated when my cat chews on the power cords to my phone, computer, etc.etc. 17. I have seen every episode of Saved by the Bell multiple times as well as the Saved by the Bell Wedding and Saved by the Bell Hawaiian Vacation movies. 18. I think Screech is now the cutest one in Saved by the Bell. 19. I am still trying to avoid my Law Review Editing job. 20. I am a realty TV junkie. Probably cause I enjoy watching others live their lives, cause I usually don’t live my own. 21. I like to spy on people I used to know, but no longer keep in contact via the internet. 22. I hate when my dad makes me give him a budget or makes me tell him what I am spending my money on. 23. I think I should probably take Xanax for my anxiety, but don’t. 24. The craziest things I have done were when I was drunk and I don’t remember them. 25. Currently, I am unable to strike up a conversation with the hot guy at school. 26. I secretly fear that he will find as much to criticize about me as I do. 27. I started this list a while ago, and am not sure whom I am talking about in #25 and #26. 28. I buy more books than I can read, hoping that I will get around to them all eventually. 29. I hate checking out books from the library 30. I always forget to return books to the library and then incur late fees 31. Plus, you aren’t reading a book from the library, but reading it with everybody else that checked it out before you. 33. And I get anxious and feel pressured to read a book within in a certain time period when I check books out from the library. 34. Then, I don’t read the book at all, forget to take it back, and get late fees for no reason. 35. But I still think libraries are a good idea.  36. They’re just not for me. 37. I have been in love with Prince William since I saw him walk behind his mother’s casket at her funeral. 38. I have been in lust with Prince Harry since he started doing drugs and hanging out with slutty girls. 39. Mo Rocca is my ideal man. 40. I have no idea is he is gay or straight. 41. I am assuming he is probably gay. 42. I have always wanted to have an affair with a professor. 43. But I could never bring myself to do it. 44. I have dyed my hair since I was 12. 45. I am currently trying to grow long hair. 46. Cause I never have had hair past my shoulders. 47. My hair never holds a perm. 48. I wish my hair were slightly thicker. 49. I am very shy when I first meet people. 50. But once I get to know someone, I get really loud and obnoxious. 51. I like the Britney Spears’ movie  Crossroads  52. I think Britney Spears’ fiancé is so ugly. 53. I love Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. 54. I have seen  She’s All That  an ungodly amount of times. 55. I have lived in these places: 56.

My brother is the most creative person I know 68. My sister is my best friend 69. My dad told me I was the most “needy” of his children 70. I am terrible at math 71. I haven’t taken a math class since eleventh grade. 72. When I have a job, I have an irrational fear that I am always about to get fired. 73. I like orange-flavored tic tacs 74. I want to get a pug and name it “Mr. Pugsley” 75. I think there should be a law that only Colin Firth may play Mr. Darcy or characters based on Mr. Darcy. 76. I thought I was actually going to marry Christian Bale when I was younger. 77. I like to make fun of Gary Busey 78. I majored in History and minored in Philosophy in college. 79.

Don’t think I could function without access to the Internet for very long. 86. I hate talking on the phone 87. I wish I had an iPod. 88. I am a certified scuba diver. 89. But I really don’t like to scuba dive 90. Because I am afraid of sharks 91. Since I saw  Jaws  at a very early age 92. Hated taking baths as a kids 93. Because I thought sharks would come out of the bathtub 94. I thought I had a good singing voice as a child 95. But in reality I am tone deaf 96. I hate giving speeches 97. I get really nervous 98. And feel like I am going to throw up 99. At about 6, I got lost at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. 100. While I was lost, I was afraid to talk to a police officer, because I thought it was just a man dressed as a cop who wanted to kidnap me.Get tired of hearing that people are scared of clowns. 101.No, they aren’t THAT creepy!

      Why does it seem like such a task for me to shower? I like being clean, and that usually wins out over not showering, but the amount of energy that it takes to get to the point of showering just seems to be mentally exhausting sometimes.&nbsp;  It really isn't so much the showering part, but all that shit you have to do AFTER the shower to: towel off, search for clean underwear,&nbsp; search for the cleanest clothing on the floor, wash face, put on lotion, dry hair, put on make-up, blah, blah, blah...It just seems like so much wasted time on a daily basis to go through.

      I give up! I am going to read the Harry Potter books. I am quite frankly tired of hearing people tell me what fabulous books they are and how they  know  I'll love them. So, you've worn me down folks...I'll give them a go, as I just purchased the first book off Ebay for $0.99.  ************** I really love to use swear words. A fucking BUNCH! Even better, I love to learn random swear words in other languages.  I knew a Lithuanian girl when I studied in Iceland. She taught me a bunch of Lithuanian and Russian curse words.&nbsp; A month later when I went to study in Holland, I found out that another girl in the program was Lithuanian. Immediately, I rushed over to her, and with the biggest grin of pride on my face, I proceeded to show off my knowledge of Lithuanian swear words.  Me: * in Lithuanian * Fuck off!  Lithuanian girl: * in English * Excuse me?  Me: * repeats in Lithuanian * FUCK. OFF.  Lithuanian girl: Oh...um...  Me: * now in English * Oh, sorry...My name is Claire. You're from Lithuania, right? I just wanted to try out some of the Lithuanian curse words I've learned.  In retrospect, I probably would have been wise to introduce myself and given that disclaimer before I started with the barrage of curse words. But sometimes, these things just don't cross my mind...

      I hate editing. I hate editing other people's stuff. Hell, I don't even really like editing my own work. Which is sort of why I hope that a "schedule conflict" will release me from the obligation of editing this law review article.  I was lured by the money at first, but after the first day of editing, and the reality of the project set in, I realized that my need to lounge around far outweighs having the green stuff waved in my face.&nbsp; After I sent in my edits for last night, my boss emailed me and said that he would like to have the whole first edit (the article is 201 pages long) done by early next week. Considering it takes me about 2.5 hrs to edit 12 pages, I don't think that is going to happen. And I don't want it to happen. A lot more of the green stuff is going to have to be waved in my face for me to put in that amount of effort. At least double what he is paying me now! I just wrote him an e-mail and informed him of how much I am willing to work, and that his deadlines conflict with my work schedule. Now, I am sitting back and crossing my fingers that he will "no longer be in need of my services".  &nbsp;

      Overall, today was a good day. Not the BEST day, but it was quite pleasant. Here are the reasons why:  1) I treated myself to a Sausage, Egg, and Cheese McGriddle and a Diet Coke for Breakfast. 2) I showed up an hour late for work and got paid for it! 3) I spent an hour before lunch chatting with a co-worker 4) Spent the whole time after&nbsp;lunch until I went home watching "I Love the 90s" and "On-Air with Ryan Seacrest" and got paid for it! 5) I get to sleep in as long as I want to tomorrow....and Sunday. 6) I got both Us Weekly and Instyle in the mail today! 7) I got my haircut, and fixed my bangs which I had cut with a pair of kitchen shears in a fit of insanity.

      The drive to work is along a rather rural two-laned highway.&nbsp; I pass by large, looming corn fields with what I am sure is teeming with creepy, blonde-haired children. What I have noticed for the past week or so are a number of large garbage sacks left along the side of the highway, spaced about two hundred feet apart from each other. It looks like there are dead bodies in carelessly stuffed inside.&nbsp; At first, I giggled at the absurdity of the idea, but now, I think there might actually BE dead bodies inside. And what a perfect disposal site. Who is really going to stop and see what the contents of these bags are? I imagine at some point the highway patrol might do something about it, but considered the large numbers of roadkill and abandoned cars along the side of the road, I don't think it would be in this fiscal year.

      So, let me just take one moment to tell everyone how fabulous I am at this precise moment. Don't blink, because it will be over in three, two, one...fuck! It passed already! &nbsp; Well, a few moments ago, I was fabulous, because I found out that I have another job proofreading a law review article for a lawyer (well, I have a three-hour trial period, so provided I don't fuck it up, the job is mine). Again, really good thing to put on my resume.  &nbsp; Then, I just checked my summer grades, and I got an "A" in Legal Process! Hot Damn!&nbsp; From what I hear though, everyone gets an "A", and the grade I am REALLY worried about is my Evidence grade, which I am hoping I don't fail simply because I don't want to have to re-take the course!  &nbsp; Also, this morning when I got to work, I had piles of work on my desk from my boss. I was quite impressed with how I drafted a promissory note in about 30 mins., including my requisite "staring into space" time.&nbsp; I felt like a pro...But don't be fooled, folks. Drafting most legal documents is, like, what my sister refers to as "MadLibs for Lawyers".&nbsp; You have a form that you usually copy key language from, tinker with it a bit,&nbsp; fill in the blanks, and voila! Customized Legal Document that you can charge lots of money for! Sometimes, I really, really DO love this profession.

      I have been so bad about waking up at a proper time for work lately. It sort of feels like the movie  Groundhog's Day , because almost the exact same thing happens every morning. &nbsp; 1. My alarm goes off at 6am.  2. I hit "snooze" until about 6:20am 3. I get up to go to the bathroom  4. Go back to bed resolving to sleep until 6:35am. 5. Magically, it is 7:30am, also known as The time I should be leaving for work! &nbsp; It's terrible, and it happens every single day, which has made me about 15-20 minutes late for work every day. No one has said anything, but still not really good for the image either. &nbsp; ****************** Yesterday, I got the new  Entertainment Weekly  in the mail, and I noticed an article featuring a list of guilty pleasures. Most of them, I could at least understand...hey, to each his own, but I do vehemently disagree with the addition of Kevin Costner and Peter Cetera to the list!&nbsp; Gross. (sidenote: am I the only person on the continent who HATES Peter Cetera?) If I didn't hate Tom Cruise so much right now, I would be more outraged. &nbsp; But alas, I shall just make a list of guilty pleasures of my own! &nbsp; 1. Saved by the Bell 2. Danny Bonaduce 3. The short-lived New Leave it to Beaver 4. Cheesy romance novels 5. Freddie Prinze Jr. 6. TLC's A Wedding Story 7. Dr. Phil 8. Dr. Phil's son, Jay McGraw 9. Sharon Osbourne's talk show 10. The Real World 11. Britney Spears 12. Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen 13. 7th Heaven 14. Days of Our Lives

      I have had this idea for quite some time. I am fairly certain that someone out there has already developed it, but until that person comes forward, I am claiming it as my own. &nbsp; For those single and/or undersexed girls or merely those looking for a little change, I introduce to you. &nbsp; THE TALKING VIBRATOR, VIBEY 3000: Pre-Programmed to Love and Pleasure You All Night Long (or until the batteries wear out). &nbsp; I know that there are vibrators on the market in which you can record your own messages, but my idea consists of pre-recorded messages designed to fit your particular sexual mood. &nbsp; There is: &nbsp;  Vibey the Romantic : Let Vibey's deep, soothing, and sensual voice make sweet, sweet love to you as you reach the heights of pleasure. &nbsp; Feeling a little kinky? Let  Vibey the Freak  talk dirty to you with your choice of 1) dirty 2) Naaaasty or 3) Downright perverted! &nbsp; This vibrator would also feature optional fetish talk customized to fulfill your&nbsp;deepest, darkest&nbsp;fetish. &nbsp; For single girls, get all the satisfaction of being with a man without the hassle and arguments. No need to wonder if the Vibey 3000 (pending a better name) really likes you, cause he tells it like it is, bitch! &nbsp; In a relationship and but wonder what it would be like with another man? Well, the Vibey 3000 allows to you simulate the feeling of a secret lover without any of the guilt and lies. &nbsp; What ever your sexual needs may be, the Vibey 3000 satisfies all of them. Just ask our distributor and satisfied customer, Ron Popeil!

      God, I don't know what it is, but I cannot seem to escape Tom Cruise today. He is on the television. He is in the magazines I read. He is in the news headlines. Go Away! &nbsp; It is all encapsulated in the Morrissey song mentioned in the above title.

      I just got the latest issue of  Interview  in the mail today, and I was sickened to see an interview with Jada Pinkett-Smith by Tom Cruise! The guy makes no sense at all! Take the following for example. Will someone tell me what this means? &nbsp; "No, I think there's a thing when you look at someone who has ethics presence, when it's like, you're going to have to deal with me as a human being. I went to a lot of different schools growing up, so I can relate to that. It's like, I am who I am" &nbsp; The only explanation I have for this is that he read something like this out of L. Ron Hubbard's "Sound Smart and Obtuse"! &nbsp; Here is another gem...again with the "went to a lot of different schools" bit! &nbsp;  Tom Cruise : Life's going to bring you problems. Was that a bit of a shock to you? &nbsp;   Jada Pinkett-Smith : Hell, yes. &nbsp;  Tom Cruise : It was a bit of a shock to me. I remember, I went to so many schools, I didn't even go to my graduation. I was just like, "I am out of here, man. I am sick of these problems." Suddenly, it struck me one day: "Okay, Life is problems." And you know what? I know of like some of these problems. And then there's a day when I went, "Okay, you mean I have a choice sometimes of what problems I want?" It's like you want to work, you want to raise your family, you want everything. And people are saying, "Well, you can't have everything." Well, I don't know about that. &nbsp; What the fuck, Tom Cruise?

      Don't tell anyone, but I skipped work today. I called in sick, and I plan on making up the day on Friday, but I just couldn't do it today. Just. Couldn't. Do. It.  &nbsp; So, in case you are wondering, that is why I am posting obsessively to my blog.&nbsp; I thought it about time for me to revisit my Likes/Dislikes List! &nbsp;  Likes : taking mental health days.&nbsp; the movies.&nbsp; subway sandwiches. V8 splash smoothies in orange creme. booze that doesn't taste like booze. drunk-dialing. reminiscing. the smell of fresh-cut grass and gasoline (individually). ice cream. "flavors of the day".&nbsp; programmable coffeemakers. living alone. chatting. staring into space. text messages. the manager at the movie theatre. boy bands. saying things like, "quite". a new pair of pants. my "i heart nerds" shirt. steve carrell in "anchormen".&nbsp; on-air with ryan seacrest. imagining ryan seacrest using the phrase "seacrest in. seacrest out. seacrest in. seacrest out." during sex. fireflies. full moons. &nbsp;  Dislikes : tom cruise. junk mail. needy cats. dirty dishes. paula abdul. going to work. being an adult. the british (as a whole, not individually).&nbsp; the view.&nbsp; not receiving my us weekly in a timely manner. the po-po. quiznos. not getting any text messages in a day. hands-free headsets for cell phones. my gag-reflex.

      There is a strange, strange phenomenon that always seems to happen to me when I go to the movies. No matter how empty the theatre might be, someone always feels the need to sit down either in the row directly&nbsp;in front of me (thus preventing me from putting my feet up) or directly behind me. &nbsp; It really is annoying, because 1) I really don't like to be around strangers that much, and that is why I am choosing to go an sit in a dark theatre for two hours, and 2) these are often the very people who have obnoxious theatre behavior (e.g., eating popcorn loudly, talking, etc). &nbsp; This happened to me yesterday when I went to go see  A Cinderella Story  (groan, but I do love Jennifer Coolidge). My friend, Kristin, and I had taken our seats somewhere in the middle of the theatre. Just as the movie was starting, a group of three young boys (YES! boys! I usually am not one to impose arbitrary gender stereotypes upon people, but dudes, you just saw a Hilary Duff movie! And they weren't old enough to be going merely because she is hot) sat immediately in the seats behind us, despite the theatre being virtually empty. &nbsp; Kristin and I exchanged a look that communicated that things were about to take a turn for the worse, and they did.&nbsp; The boy seated behind me felt it necessary to lean forward and eat his popcorn loudly in my ear.&nbsp; Popcorn-eating in general is sort of a pet peeve of mine in that the noise of people crunching on it drives me crazy, so I really didn't like that the crunching&nbsp;occurred about 6 inches from my ear. &nbsp; Then, surprise! surprise! They talked throughout the whole fucking movie! I turned around a few times (okay, a lot!), interchanging evil glances, loud sighs, and a somes "Shusshes", but nothing seemed to work. &nbsp; Finally, I just succumbed to the fact that nothing would prevent them from ruining my movie experience, and just resolved to try and block it out as much as possible, using the same technique employed when ignoring my dad as a teenager. &nbsp; In spite of something similar to this happening nearly everytime I go to the movies, I still must go. There is something still so purely wonderful about the lights going down, the previews, and completely forgetting about the outside world for 1.5-2 hrs. &nbsp; Plus, the manager at my movie theatre is HAWT. I am serious, even though I have never spoken with him, I am in love with him. One time, that one precious time, he took my ticket, and our fingers ended up touching, and I swear to God, there was electricity.

      I can't help it. I have been funneling all my usual angst into my hatred for Tom Cruise.&nbsp; I get so angry every time I see him or hear people refer to him. Why is this guy still famous? &nbsp; I get it, okay. He is somewhat attractive.&nbsp; I have to admit that my loins did a little jump when I saw him butcher an Irish accent in  Far&amp;Away . I found him a bit charming and likeable in  Jerry McQuire . And though I haven't seen it, I can accept that he might have done a decent job in  Magnolia . &nbsp; But please, I can't stand that people seem to take this man seriously as an actor. I know in your heart of hearts you don't, but it seems like everyone is giggling nervously&nbsp;and agreeing that Tom Cruise might be worthy of an Oscar, because everyone else seems to think so. It's dogma, folks!&nbsp;Cast off this antiquated notion that began sometime in the early to mid- eighties, I implore you. &nbsp; Don't be fooled by Nancy O'Dell on Access Hollywood marching with a picket sign reading, "Tom Got Robbed" after last year's Oscar nominations. Don't let Oprah sway you into thinking that he convincingly conveys an ounce of emotion or believeability.&nbsp;Tom Cruise cannot act his way out of a soaking wet paperbag. &nbsp; Yesterday, my friend, Kristin, and I went to the movies where we saw a preview for his new movie,  Collateral .&nbsp; I went off into my usual rant about why they keep making Tom Cruise run in movies: &nbsp;  Me : Oh, God! He's a terrible runner. They  always  make him run in movies! &nbsp;  Kristin : Yeah, even if he was playing a parapalegic, they would still probably make him run. &nbsp;  Me : Thank God, he didn't star in  My Left Foot ! &nbsp; &nbsp; While watching Access Hollywood this week, they had coverage of the Espy Awards, where Tom Cruise gave a tribute to Ron Tillman. Who's fucking idea was that? I could only stand to watch about&nbsp; 5 seconds of Tom Cruise trying to be serious and touching and trying to have respect for the dead.  &nbsp; In short, I wish Tom Cruise would go away again, but not to make Mission Impossible: 3 either. I just fear that if he were to ever die, he would have a bigger funeral than Reagan. &nbsp; ******** Last night, I went to a sex toy party. Sounds interesting, right? To be honest, it kind of sucked ass. I have found in my experience that there is nothing worse than being surrounded by dildos and hicks. The combinations DOES NOT work.  &nbsp; I arrived late with my friend, so I had about 20 vibrators shoved in my direction in the span of about five minutes. There is nothing cool or sexy about trying to juggle a bunch of vibrators in your hands. &nbsp; Then, after things began to die down, the conversation turned toward current events. The hicks pretended to have an educated opinion about what we SHOULD have done in Iraq, which consisted of going in there, "cleaning house", then helping ourselves to 75% of the oil reserves for "saving their fucking country."&nbsp; I just about puked in my sex toy catalog I pretended to be so engrossed in.&nbsp; I would have prefered to have that arm-sized phallus shoved up my unlubricated ass than have had to witness that conversation. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I just read an article about an animal rights organization who named Andre 3000 from Outkast and Alicia Silverstone as "The World's Sexiest Vegetarians". What disturbed me the most about this article was a quote from Andre 3000, which said, "I like to have sex with a beautiful lady, and then go and eat a big bowl of broccoli". Yes, I think I read about that technique in the Kama Sutra.   In keeping with this theme, here are a few suggestions for other "World Sexiest" titles:  1) World's Sexiest Scientologist  2) World's Sexiest Plushie  3)World's Sexiest Ventriloquist  4) World's Sexiest Butt-Rocker   Please leave a comment for all other "World's Sexiest" submissions.

      I have been out of the loop for awhile, the television loop that is. I have a laundry list of excuses, ranging from school, pesky roommates, and a bad case of ennui.   Apparently, I haven't missed much either. American Idol is over. No more Apprentice. Hell, there isn't even Friends as a last choice option.  Last night, I finally turned on the television and half-watched episodes of  For Love or Money  and  Who Wants to Marry My Dad? . I wish I hadn't.  During  For Love or Money , the only slightly interesting thing about that show is how incredibly convoluted and scripted it has become. The cast even SOUNDS like they are reading off a script. There wasn't an ounce of believability behind those "shocked" and "surprised" faces when the twist was revealed.    Marry My Dad  seemed less scripted, but it appeared to me that the cast must be on high doses of psycho-medication in order to believe they were actually feeling those emotions. How disturbing has reality television become when they put contestants into wedding dresses and have them write "marriage vows" to some man they met two days ago.  My friends, the apocalypse is near.

      Finals are over. And while I feel relief, I also feel as if I have gone through what it feels like to squeeze a 10 lb. baby out of something the size of a lemon (metaphorically, of course) for about the last week or so. As a result, I am feeling a little blue.   There is always this period after finals where I don't quite know what to do with myself. I feel a bit empty and a bit lost and a bit unsure of what to do with myself. I feel a bit like Marie Osmond after having her 20th child, I guess.  This never last more than an evening at the most, cause then I realize that I have a ton of things that I would much rather do than school and felt guilty when I did do them during the semester.   But for the moment, this brief moment, I feel the emptiness that follows when you produce something, and let it out into the world, and just hope and pray that you didn't fuck it up too badly.

      My cat is a bit of a snob when it comes to shoes. He has proceeded to chew up (yes, like a dog) three pairs of my $3 Target Flip Flops. I usually have to put them out of reach when I take them off, so that he can't chew them, but the moment I become careless and leave them on the floor, he is all over them.  Come to think of it, I can't tell if it is blind, seething rage that he has for these flip flops or a sick, perverse love for them. One of the times I caught him in the act, he had rubbed his face all over the shoes, like it was cat nip. Only not cat nip, because he doesn't like cat nip.  But after this ritualistic gesture of smearing his scent all over the shoes, he began voraciously tearing apart the soles of the shoes like it was some sort of injured gazelle he caught in the Serengeti. It was vicious. I even had to avert my eyes from the carcass for a moment before I snatched the shoe away from his grip.  He doesn't seem to get this "crazed" when it comes to my other shoes. Sometimes, he will sniff them and paw at them a bit, but they don't bring out the same raw, animalistic tendencies.   After careful study of his habits, like Diane Fossi or Jane Goodall, I have determined that he is merely prejudiced against cheap shoes, and gets off on performing ritualize shoe-icide upon them.

      Yesterday was my brother's birthday. Like a good sister would, I left him a birthday greeting on his answering machine and sent him an e-card.  This morning, he replied via email, and this was his response to how he was doing:  "Summer camp is fine and Short Circuit 2 was on TV last week, so things  are  going pretty well."   Please bear in mind that my brother just celebrated his 27th birthday. God, I love my brother!

      For some reason, I have not been able to be anywhere on time lately. This is completely against my nature, because I have been trained since birth to show up places approximately 15 minutes early.   My disposition for earliness is my mother's doing. I used to HATE that at friend's sleepovers she was ALWAYS the first mother to collect their child. Not only did I hate being ripped prematurely away from the festivities, but I also could not shake the overwhelming fear that as soon as I left, all my friends would gossip about me.  My dad always countered this by being 15 minutes or more late. A few times when I asked him to pick me up from work, he averaged about 30 minutes behind schedule. His excuse? I was cleaning the fridge, I had to wash my glasses. It didn't matter, I was still pissed that I had to spend the better part of an hour sitting on the curb outside my office building like an abandoned child, informing my co-workers as they passed by, "No, really...my ride should be here any minute."  It was always interesting when the time wars ensued between my mother and father. If we need to be somewhere, my mother would round all of us kids up and shout to my father, "It's time to go!". We would make our way down to the car, and sit there, hoping to compel my father from the house. But it never worked. Instead, he would come down, only after we had honked the horn a few times and were sufficiently pissed off, and simply say, "What were you guys doing in the car so early?"  As a result, I tended to follow my mother's example, but instead just merely tried to arrive on time, neither too early or too late. But lately, I can't seem to be anywhere on time. And strangely, there is no explanation for why I am late. My brain no longer processes the concept of being on time.  For example, here is a usual morning routine: I get up late, leaving myself only about a half hour to get ready and drive to school. After a quick shower and getting dressed, somehow my brain thinks it is a good idea to check my email with only 15 minutes before class and my hair still soaking wet. Not just a quick check, but rather carefully reading each email, including junk mail.   This just confirms that I am slowly turning into my father with each passing year.

       Reading:  Federal Rules of Evidence and a stray article from InTouch...oh, Mary-Kate Olsen, Get Well!   Listening to:  "Surfing on a Rocket"--Air   Watching:  Matthew Broderick in "The Music Man"   Mood:  Ambivalent. _____________________________________  Fireflies...It's a good thing! My childhood and tween days are filled of summer nights in the backyard capturing them in my hands and watching them glow. At more sadistic times, I would crush them and smear their green, glowing goo on whoever stood closest to me.   There are no fireflies in Utah. I haven't seen them in years. So, when I spot a flurry of green flashes in the tall grasses during the early evening, a wide smile creeps onto my face that I cannot rub away.   ******  Last night, I half-watched some television for the first time in ages as I prepared notecards for my final. I happened to catch a commecial for the new Tom Cruise movie,  Collateral . I pose this question, Why do they keep letting Tom Cruise make movies?   I realize he is pretty to look at for two hours, so I guess my real question is, Why do the Hollywood producers still let Tom Cruise operate under this delusion that he  can act? Put him in a light, uplifting piece of fluff where he gets to smile a lot, slather on the charm, blow-up things, and make your $200 million at the box office...fine.   But please, Jerry Bruckheimers, Cameron Crowes, and Joel Silvers of Hollywood, I am not fooled (at least for long) that Tom Cruise is a serious actor merely by dying his hair a different color, and straining to keep the corners of his mouth to keep from smiling in order to convey intensity. Putting him in elaborate historical costume still does not detract from the fact that his eyes are completely void of emotion. And please, learn a lession from  A Few Good Men  and  The Firm , Tom Cruise is a silly-looking runner. Seeing Tom Cruise in a full-out sprint just evokes a series of giggles and the distinct realization that he runs like a girl.   Please Hollywood, let us retire the notion that Tom Cruise is an appealing screen image before the pre-production for MI:4.

       Reading:  Take a guess...nothing fun.   Listening to:  Jay-Z's "Dirt Off Ya Shoulders"   Watching:  The rain fall outside my window   Mood:  Unproductive ______________________________________  My sister called me last night. She told me that she was getting married, but the way she told me was more in passing, like "Oh, D and I want to go to Spain...and while we are there, we want to get married." Like an afterthought, or rather like that is just something that you do while in Spain. Go see the Alhambra, the Guggenheim, and get married.  I am happy for her. I truly am. I guess I am just in shock about it. She and her boyfriend have lived together for the last three years or so, and just bought a house and a puppy this last Spring. For all intents and purposes, they already are married, so why is the piece of paper to make it official necessary?  My attitude toward marriage has always been very much against it. For historical reasons, I don't particularly want to engage in something that originated as an "exchange of property."  Sure, I would like to have a long-term relationship at some point, but marriage just seems like a hassle.   For some strange reason, I am a bit sad, cause she will be losing her last name. She won't be "one of us" any more, or at least it won't be apparent by her surname. But, as the old cliche goes, I am not losing a sister, but gaining a brother.  Congratulations to my sister and her boyfriend!  *************  On a completely un-related note, the beastmaster said to me the other day, "Maybe I should take down my bed while I am gone, so you can't have sex on it."  Next week after finals, she is leaving to go home for the rest of the summer. About this time, the guy I have started seeing will be coming to visit, and a shag-a-thon will ensue. Naturally, it had crossed my mind that I would indeed proceed to fuck at least once on her bed, and I guess the devious look on my face gave it all away without me saying anything.   "Noooooo, of course I won't have sex on your bed!" I said with fingers crossed behind my back.   I feel bad...Really, I do, because I certainly would be pissed if my roommate fucked someone on my bed. I love my bed. I don't like her. And I certainly don't want her naked-ass on my bed. As a relatively nice person who tries to treat people the way I wish to be treated, I decided that it would be wrong of me to engage in sexual activities on her bed. But in the same moment, that is EXACTLY why the idea is so hot and appealing...Maybe being nice in this situation means washing the sheets after I'm done.

      Tomorrow, I am off to Chicago for the weekend to visit with my mom and sister who are in town. I can't wait. It is sure to be a weekend full of girly stuff, like pedicures and manicures and (my favorite) shopping!  But, upon my return home, my roommate will be back in the apartment. It is officially our last week living together, which I am very excited about, but at the same time, wish I had the weekend to myself. It has been so nice having complete reign over the apartment. None of that incessant chattering about school, school, and more school.  Before she gets home, I am trying to tidy up the apartment. A few weeks ago while in a drunken rage, Monica and I pulled off an ugly "berry" wreath from the living room wall, which we both expressed disdain for and threw it on her bed. So, I had to replace the wreath and wipe a few loose berries from her bed.  I am also taking a few moments of silence with the various "American Flag" decorations that I have been forced to look at for the past year.  Sure, I have grimaced at them every time I pass by and I can't say that I will miss them in my new apartment, but in a way, we have bonded...mainly out of my intense dislike for them. But that connection, bad though it may be, is still there.  Plus, I have somewhat tolerated my roommate's ultra-needy cat, who I have dubbed "Thurman" (after the fat kid in  Bad Santa ), who jumps on my bed in the middle of the night and stares creepily at me in the dark.  Despite this, I am glad to be moving out and just wish that this next week will be over as soon as possible.

      I just called the cable company to set up internet services and cable services. They were having a special on cable where I could get 4 months of cable for $24.99 (reg. $74.99!)! Hurrah! I am going to have oodles of cable for a little while, until I cancel it once the price goes up again! I hope to god I can get some studying done! But I really don't care, CAUSE IT IS CABLE TELEVISION!

      Ennui. I have felt so uninspired lately to post on my blog lately, but alas, the cloud has lifted and here I am...penning this entry.  Well, I have put it off long enough, but with school about to start in less than two weeks and my lease expiring at the end of the month, I figured it was time to get another apartment. And an apartment is what I got.  Right now, I am giddy at the thought of having ALL that space to myself! My second to last apartment was the first apartment I had on my very own. It was a cute, little studio just a few blocks from downtown Salt Lake. I loved it, cause the bus to work stopped right in front on my apartment building and dropped me off about a block away from work. The main room was large and spacious, and the kitched had an icebox left over from who knows when.  It was small, but it was my own.  Then, I moved to law school, and thought it would be financially-prudent to have a roommate. It was nice to have someone around at first when I didn't know anyone, but then, I just yearned to have my own place again. I have come up with a new life philosophy on apartments: If I am not fucking you, I don't want to live with you.   No, that doesn't mean that I would have to start fucking my roommate just so we can keep living together (GROSS!), but I just think it is a generally good rule of thumb.  And now, I am able to live out my philosophical ponderings with an apartment of my very own. I just signed the lease today, and should be able to start moving in next week. It's a two bedroom apartment, which coincidentally happened to be cheaper than most one bedroom apartments in the area. How I am practically squealing with delight at the thought of having a guest bedroom/office at my disposal...It's almost aristocratic, really.  The only downside is that I have all this room and hardly any furniture o furnish it. What's more, I currently don't have the money to get the furnishing until my sweet ass financial aid check is put into my dirty little hands.   But overall, I am optimistic about my new living situation, and can have ALL the gentlemen callers I want without a nosy roommate there to gossip about it.

      I just had to make a slurpee run, cause I got an inexplicable craving for one about an hour ago. Now, my lips are stained bluish/purple as if I have suffered a bad cause of hypothermia. I feel like I am five years old again, where I had a permanently-stained kool-aid lips for the better part of a year. I kid you not! I have the pictures to prove it.  ***** Alas, I feel a bit sad, as it dawned on me that school will start again in a matter of two weeks. My heart will ache for these sublime days in which I put in the requisite hours at work, with a good portion of those hours spent staring into space and chatting with co-workers and taking cat-naps,  and then have the rest of the evening to spend guilt-free, without the burden of homework looming over my shoulder. It's just not FAIR! WAAAA!

      Since when is Jennifer Aniston blonde? Apparently, E! television seems to think that she always was blonde, and has listed her as one of the most ambitious blondes. Sure, her hair has gotten lighter over the years, but it takes a stretch of the imagination to call her blonde with a straight face.  And when did Jessica Simpson become one of the top three brainy blondes in Hollywood? Do I really need to comment on what is wrong with that sentence?  On another note, I have become a bit addicted to Days of Our Lives. Well, I have been on and off since for the last ten years. I have noticed that Kyle from the Real World Chicago has joined the cast as Phillip, and I have to say that I am quite impressed with his acting ability. Despite the horrible script, he does a good job delivering the lines in the most believeable way possible.  And can I tell you how much I love the Sammy/Lucas love fest! It is so nice that they completely ignore their son, Will, in order to make googly eyes at each other.

      This morning, I woke up for work on time. I didn't wake up at exactly the time I should be walking out the door, and then spend the next 10 minutes running frantically around my apartment, muttering "Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!"  But instead of getting ready at a normal pace that would allow me to leave on schedule for the first time in THREE WEEKS, I turned on my computer, checked my email, and then proceeded to lie in bed for 10 minutes thinking of every possible excuse that would allow me to not go to work.  The day before, I called in and said that I was getting my car fixed. The most plausible excuse I could think of this morning was that my cat was sick (he does have the sniffles) and needed to take him to the vet.  Feeling that this wasn't adequate, I even did a quick Google search for excuses to not go to work. I GOOGLED for excuses not to go to work! Alas, the search was fruitless, and I ended up just sucking it up and going to work.

      I love the show  Starting Over ! I love the women trying to pretend like their problems are actually serious and how they infuse the deepest meaning and symbolism into even taking a shit.  For the past week or so, they have brought the women back to host re-runs of the old episodes. They gussie up these women with pancake make-up, rendering unrecognizable. I am also fairly convinced that they give them a good does of Oxycontin to give them that euphoric perma-smile.  The whole thing has a distinct Stepford-wives feel. It is as if these women go into the house and become robots...Which would make an infinitely more interesting show if they did. And they would call the show  Starting Over...As Robots! . Ah, if only...
