      Just watched Dong1 Fang1 bu4 bai4(first shown in 1992) a.k.a Xiao4 Ao4 Jiang1 Hu2 a.k.a Swordsman II on channel 8.Its a cool movie,one of the rare wuxia stories you get a glimpse of on saturday or friday late nights e.g. dao1(sword ,in chinese)  Terminology 1)JiangHu :In the movie it refers to the pugilistic world and its affairs but generally speaking,today,the chinese use it to refer to various arenas of competition. e.g. the business world. Literally,it means River & lake.That is something I don't understand.  As you can see from the title,Swordsman 2,its the sequel to the movie,swordsman.The sequel is set around the Ming dynasty and is about a swordsman ,Lin Wu Chung and his comrades from the Wah Mountain Sect who decide to travel to Ox mountain to retire from the pugilistic world and lead a life of recluse after being betrayed by their master(their master went power crazy and was obssessed with the kuay4 hua1 bao2 dian3 which is the infamous wushu manual that has the secret of invincibility,which unfortunately is castration).But unfortunately,before they can reach their destination,they get tied up with matters of the pugilistic world (jianghu) again and 5 of the brothers get killed.LinWuchung is unable to retire from Jianghu as his enemies are afraid he would exact his vengeance upon them one day.He has then no choice but to re enter the pugilistic world and kill DongFangBuBai who he has fallen in love with after mistaking   him  for a woman.DongFangBubai is the guy who castrated himself in order to learn the kuay hua bao dian so that he can overthrow the Ming Dynasty and rule over the Han people who have oppressed the Miao minority(his race).   "The seas laugh,lashing on both shores carried in the waves,only me and now...  -Xiao Ao Jiang Hu (briefly translated into english probably means 'mocking the pugilistic world')  Reminds me of the sec IVs who are going to pass out from the unit real soon.   urlLink THe Movie Review is Here

So,the holidays are over and I ain't going to be happy ever again.Heard Roy has been studying 5-6 hours everyday and thats probably more than I have been studying for the  whole of June. Hyak hyak..............  Am sick since the day before yesterday,coughed up bloody phelgm this morning and I'm downing clorets every 1/2 an hour and sneezing cos of the mint and then causing further abrasion to my sore throat.  Damn,theres nobody online cos all of them are having training while I lie around at home.   Hey,the lion will lay down with the lamb ... and gobble it up when its hungry again!w

      Ah,the joys of personal expression!~    The Riddle   Listen to the clich√©d quickened pulse, accelerated heartbeat, hurried breathing and feel the clammy palms. Observe the hands, how they fumble within the caverns of the pockets, to sub consciously form fists or to jingle coins within. Variably but certainly, every individual of the human race has experienced these symptoms of an ailment which I dare say , all individuals of the human race has contracted before. Every second, there are hundreds if not thousands contracting this mysterious disease which if not treated with care may be  terminal .   ....should be easy

      Its 0033 hrs,I havn't finished all my revision but I'm too lazy to carry on.Unlike those Chinese PRC scholars who probably study from when they get home to 2 in the morning.They probably prick themselves with needles to stay awake,I don't ever see them drinking coffee in the canteens,I frequent the canteen in the morning sometimes.Then I drink lots of coffee,its a horrible,foul smelling dark liquid(sounds familiar?) thats why I drink it,thats the whole idea.Its just like poking yourself with sharp objects to stay awake,just another kind of pain felt by another kind of receptor.  My sis gave me 3 books just now.Holy.Good books you know?The Bourne identity,Bourne Supremacy,Bourne ultimatum.Don't ask me about price cos...no.1,a good book is worth more than that,you know it.#2)my sis got it for free,its part of her job.No,she doesn't sell books in Borders.  Passing out this week.Passing out parade.Passing out in Parade.Crikes.I've never passed out in parade before,should I try it?Are we gonna go out with a bang or are we gonna fade into oblivion(like our seniors,to an extent,its our fault,nyaaanyaaa).I won't be surprised if our passing out parade is conducted at the school front porch,after all,our juniors think we're a bunch of phoney specialists.Will we party untill dawn or will only a handful of us hang around after the parade?Will we be as one again for the last time?Will I bring my camera and take lots of pictures?I reckon I will.         you are paleturquoise  #AFEEEE         Your dominant hues are green and blue. You're smart and you know it, and want to use your power to help people and relate to others. Even though you tend to battle with yourself, you solve other people's conflicts well.

You may not be the go-to person when something really needs done, but you know never to blow things out of proportion.  Your outlook on life is bright.

      I've been so busy this week,so much work & so little time.  Well,actually I was too engrossed playing Black & White(God sim/RPG) on my PC.I'm addicted to the comp again.Anyone out there who'd volunteer to keep my mouseball for me?  Last Wednesday , got into some trouble with the DM and the physics teacher KP.It started out in quite a harmless manner.Classmates and I went out of school for lunch before our physics remedial and got back 10 minutes late cos we missed the bus and we were too lazy to walk back to school(which would take 10mins).Then we had the DM threaten to boot us out of this school which is totally shit.Now we have to see the DM every morning,reccess and lunchbreak which means I can't sleep in class during the mornings or watch the other kids play the piano(albeit out of tune is still a pleasure) during recess.  Then Friday come.... Went to watch the school concert band perform at the singapore  conference  hall,you know,pple keep mistaking it for singapore  convention  hall @ suntec.Then I met katie(neighbour) and KX,who shot me a number of dirty looks,well,actually I initiated the meeting cos I wanted a lift home from kt later. The Junior band had out of tune trumpets but the Main band was cool,QS was one of two guys who were playing the bassoon.Halfway into the concert I had this KX send me an sms that goes "U SUX!".Well,I'm not sure if she got any pleasure at the end of our non-verbal exchange cos...the last sms she sent me reads something like..."fuck you cheebye,lanjiao,xia lan,#$@%%^*&^!@#!@#@#$&*O&*(%^$%...."Heck,girls are as tough as guys nowadays,they got about as much testosterone than guys.Then in her dad's car,katie kept apologising for KX's messages which was totally ridiculous cos shes the one who gave her my number.Couple of messed up people.  Spent most of last saturday playing black & white then went out for dinner @ Zhen Fa Huo Haixian(ZhenFa live seafood) to celebrate my mothers birthday where I got stuck in a toilet  cubicle  cos the doorknob came off.  You know?Theres been lots of talk in and out and about CLASS in Singapore.You know what I think?The only real class distinction in Singapore is between the scholarly straight A types ,the neither here nor theres and your flunkers or retainers.Brains are sexy.Then money is next.  Finally,heres to the over zealous christian people I care about ,  Your mission is to propagate your faith not only to your friends and family but to bring it across 7 seas ,the fields of cathay and over africa on the wings of youth.But my mid-term aspiration is to show and prove to you,yes,only you that everything is not god's will.And to show you the  small headiness of religion  ,that the chasing of god is after all a chasing after the wind.Nothing is more important than truth,kindness and beauty.These can exist without gods.These are the only things that matter.  au revoir.

       Lets not discuss creationism,what I want to know is if there is a one supreme being, then who or what is responsible for his creation?Does God know?Does God care?Does God dare to contemplate?If he exists then what are his origins?If he has origins(which undoubtably everything has) then can he still be considered supreme?If he exists,he must exist from something .If not, can something be borned out of nothing?And what are&nbsp;the origins behind his origins,and the origins behind his origins and the origins behind his origin's origins?One layer unravels another,I could go on ad infinitum and forget what I am really trying to discover.   &nbsp;  I'm going back to my studies.

      Termination of my lead guitar course will take effect as of the 26th of july,the last Monday of this month.Then maybe,just maybe, after the O's,I will go on to step 2 of the course.   Home,hard to know what it is if you never had one Home,I can't say where it is but I know I'm going home.   You know what I see every Monday on board the NEL?Carriages half filled and no adjacent vacant seats.Go figure.Its society at its most whimsical moment.

      Had NCC day rehearsal again,irritating.Make us wake up early on a sunday leh..   [fastforward fastforward!]   On my way home,I gave dad a call,told him to pick me up at YCK mrt if he could but I didn't get the message across cos there was alot of background noise.Then suddenly my father said in chinese ,"Got indians chatting!" and after a considerable pause he said,"Keep quiet la!" Then he hung up. 0_0   So I gave mum a call and asked wheres my father,she said, with her at church.0_0 Considering the fact that only 0.000001% of indians are christians,I thought that its quite strange that there are indians around my father in the church.Anyway she passed my father the msg.   So when I got into the car at YCK,dad told me that the phone lines or something were crossed and he said he could hear 2 indians conversing during the call.0_0 I am quite sure i've not heard any indians.He then told me that everytime I call him from amoy qwee,there will be these 2 idiotic pple talking.I am positive I have not heard them.I don't think its possible that the phone lines could be crossed cos HPs don't work like your normal house tele.   -___-  Oh yes,30K credits for every GB account thats been created during and before the GB server crash!!!Add me to your buddy list if you would ,user ID : Lesfilles

      Had Chemistry lessons this morning then I went home.On the way to the bus stop I have to pass the crematorium &amp; columbarium,its Chinese.Most chinese in Singapore cremate their dead.So the grounds of the C &amp; C have got this big pagoda in the middle which is about 10 storeys tall.Then now these C &amp; C guys,whoever runs the place have built this big white gate which is easily compared to the gates of palaces in Malaysia,you know, those with Portuguese or Dutch** influences.So now,its all very strange cos under a tree in the grounds,theres a muslim grave(I've just only realised it was there).Kind of erratic.  **The arrival of Europeans in Malaysia brought a dramatic change to the country. In 1511, the Portuguese captured Melaka.[and]The Portuguese were in turn defeated in 1641 by the Dutch, who colonized Melaka [then] The British acquired Melaka from the Dutch in 1824 in exchange for Bencoolen in Sumatra.

       "Formal religions no good.It just doesnt suit the times,You've got to find the answer in yourself."  -'Behold the man',Michael Moorcock.  Went to the school library to return books.Oh, how the school librarian would cringe and shriek if she ever  reads  the books in the science fiction section.Well,not only the science fiction section,the fantasy and horror ones too.Hey,don't you know whats up with them?They've got explicit content,you know,romantic pervert kinda stuff.Of course,you wouldn't be able to tell from whatever thats written on the covers of the books.Well,its not a revelation to me and no,I don't go searching specifically for these types,its kinda like a package you know?You go searching for science fiction and you get something more.Well,lets see.......how many of us are complaining?

      The general conversation was about these 5  angmohs  who can speak fluent mandarin.And I  said  I feel very guilty cos a large number of the youth of our nation cannot read and write their MT well.I said all that in halting,broken chinese so you can imagine how much of a contradictory person I am.  Then the personal conversation is about whether I feel that housekeeping is only associated with females.Thats when I made the invigilator laugh. No regrets  though.  I'm trying to pick up HTML,Hyper Text Mark Up Language again.Cheers!!(now who signs off with that?)

      Had listening today.Was pretty cool,they tuned in to symphony 92.4fm and played Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy by Tchaikosvy before the listening compre exam.  Then we had our SYF parade,mum and dad came to watch but left after the parachutes came in.They were stuck in the jam so they couldnt get any seats when they arrived.  Then I had delifrance's(deh-lee-frons) baked rice for dinner,its very very very good,even better than Swensen's.

      It is done .I'm not going to church anymore.For one thing,i find quite a number of Christians to be hypocritical and obssessed with their religion.Totally obssessed.Brainwashed,if you like.  Depressed initiates desperate for something to believe in enter ,people who are eager to 'give god's love to everyone'(note:its god's love,not their own) reenter the   real  world.Some are so bad that they keep going on about how god is so good and how every  small thing  that happens whether good or bad is attributed to god's will.Always it is god's will,god's will,god's will.Terrorists?God has his reasons.Poverty?God has his reasons.Sickness?God has his reasons.That ,my gentle readers,is  gods will .  Christians are fond of saying how at the end of each prayer session or service 'they are changed forever',well,I think its an irony that so many of them lead doubled lives,they're so angelic in church but when they get back to their   mundane  lives,they revert back to their old crappy selves.Damn,I'll be damned if I give my life over to a journey of hypocrisy.  -strictly a free thinker

      Last Saturday was my Passing Out Parade,the parade itself wasn't much,really.  Many thanks to the juniors who were already on the parade ground when I was pondering if I should scale the walls or climb the side gate cos the primary school shut the main gate in our faces when we were about to drive into the sch compound(the fuckers!!!!).Actually I took the long way,I went one round to get in via the secondary sch,its just too scary after listening to Maria Koh.Also,thanks go out to the sec 3s and CLTs who planned the event.  We didn't have much of a rehearsal so we messed up the parade.We got dogtags for our POP,cool.I love them,they spelt my surname right.The last part was all a blur,bangs and shouts and furry blue berets in the sky.The next thing I know,I was heading mechanically towards my camera.  We went out for dinner @ Takashimaya.We wanted to dine @ Seoul Garden but it was full so we went to the LEGO shop while waiting for seats.  Derrick: haha,we are looking at Lego. ChienHan a.k.a C.H.YU:  shaddup la,if you think Lego is childish then you are immature.  In the end the last supper was taken on a flight of steps between 2 escalators,we had KFC.  Then we played LAN untill 11pm and went home.Sigh...   au revoir compagnon m' d armes!!!
