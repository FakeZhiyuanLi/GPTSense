        I'm sure I've got an extra $4000 laying around somewhere...

      My Treo 600 died&#160;&#151;&#160;again. This is the third time. I got my first one in March. I went to the PCS store and talked to the same person that waited on me the last time it happened. I asked her what the deal was with these phones. At first she tried to be diplomatic, but after I prodded her a bit, she admitted they have a fairly high failure rate.   It's too bad. I really like it and it's great when it works. The combination of a wireless phone, internet access, email and the variety of Palm apps add up to make it a very cool device. I guess as long as they're willing to cheerfully replace it when it dies, I'll stick with it. I don't travel very much, so my exposure is not too high; although it would really suck if it blew up while I was  urlLink out of town .

      Lisa and I went to see  urlLink  The Bourne Supremacy  on Friday. It felt like being on a two-hour roller coaster ride. The pace reminded me of the second Indiana Jones movie (Temple of Doom).  We both liked it. Matt Damon is pretty believable as an assasin with a conscience. In fact, all the performances were good&#160;&#151;&#160;especially Karen Allen and Julia Stiles. Why does  urlLink Brian Cox  always play bad guys? His character is a real a-hole.

      The rain made it tough to get up and moving this morning. Listened to a  urlLink story on NPR about hospice  that made me think of my  urlLink mother . Although the woman featured in the story was older, they were alike in some ways. The part where she talked about how hard it was to let others in the family handle preparation of Thanksgiving dinner really hit home. It's interesting how we are all caught up in our own lives but wind up having similar experiences without even knowing it.

      There was a rally this morning to celebrate the company's  urlLink  strong second quarter results . I didn't attend, but  urlLink just about everyone else  did. Most complained of not being able to see, but the webcast provided an excellent view of the proceedings. I think it's great that the company is doing well, but it didn't seem quite right to have such a display right on the heels of layoffs.  I just hope I wasn't conspicuous in my absence.
