      Well, kind of. I mean, what do I care if it's Friday? Just the same as any other day to me.  So yesterday we went to Home Depot and bought everything we need to clean and stain the fence. Our "plan" is to clean it today and stain it tomorrow. Well, good thing the fence isn't going anywhere because it looks like our plans will change. Delay #1 - Nicholas got into an ant hill (AGAIN) while we were finishing up the "in" side of the fence. Delay #2 - it's raining. It's supposed to rain tomorrow, too.  At least we have all the stuff now. Once we get past this cleaning stage I think it will be pretty easy. Scrubbing the fence by hand is no fun, but it sure is making a difference! I will post some before &amp; after pictures once it's all done.  My poor, ant-bitten baby is sleeping now. I guess the Benadryl knocked him out. At least that way he's not itching. :(  Two more days until Zach comes home! Yay! Registration for school is next Tuesday.  It's looking pretty gloomy outside. I hope it doesn't rain all weekend.  Whatever your weekend plans are, I hope you and your loved ones are happy, healthy, and safe. Have a good one.  -  Megan

       That means Wednesday... get your mind out of the gutter!    &nbsp;  Nicholas skipped his morning nap today, but he is more than making up for it right now. We went for a walk around the neighborhood earlier today and he fell asleep on the way home. He's been asleep ever since - and that was 3 hours ago! If he'd do this every day I wouldn't mind him only taking one nap. It's almost like having free time to myself, except I can't go anywhere.    &nbsp;  What else? I don't live a life of adventure and excitement, so if that's what you're looking for you'll have to find another blog!    &nbsp;  I want to go to a nursery and get some new plants and shrubs for our flowerbeds. The front of our house looks so... drab! Especially compared to some of the other houses in our subdivision. I've wanted to work on it for a while now, but it's just so freaking HOT outside. Today isn't too bad, though.&nbsp; Anyway, the beds really need some work. Some color, some new shrubs... I want to put a big, long bed down the side of the house, too. And some stuff in the backyard.    &nbsp;  Me and my grand plans. I have tons of 'em. Next on my list is staining the fence! That is one I really could do soon, if I'd get off my rear and DO it. I guess there's no reason why Nicholas and I can't take a ride to Home Depot when he wakes up. At least find out how much all this will cost me.    &nbsp;  That's about it for this grand Wednesday. More fun-filled entries to come.

       I tried to think of a clever title for today's post, but I'm just not up to being creative right now so you get "Tuesday".     &nbsp;   Nicholas has surprised me and slept late for the past two mornings! Yesterday he slept until 8:50 and today until 8:30. I could get used to this. Of course, Zach starts school in two weeks so all this "sleeping in" will be a moot point. That's okay, I'll enjoy it while I can.     &nbsp;   I'm going to start teaching some border classes to my CM customers (well, to anyone who is interested, really). Oh, just in case you don't know what CM is... see  urlLink http://www.creativememories.com . I've been doing some research today to get ideas for which borders to include in the class(es). I think this will be really easy and fun once I've got a plan, but it's going to take a lot of work to get it set up. I will have to decide on which borders to use (either 4 or 6), then I will have to practice making them so I can write up step-by-step instructions. I will also have to make a supplies list AND have enough of everything in stock! Ideally I would also have everything in stock so the participants could buy supplies to take home with them, but that might just have to wait. I can always order it for them. I have way too much inventory right now anyway.     &nbsp;   Joseph is working nights this week, so most of my time is spent hanging out with Nicholas. We might go wash my car when he wakes up from his nap. It sure could use it!     &nbsp;   Well, I can't think of anything interesting so say so I will end this for today.    -Megan

       Well, here it is... Monday again. I guess it doesn't really matter much to me what day of the week it is, except for knowing how much longer until Zach comes home! Nicholas slept until 8:50 this morning! That really caught me off guard. I just put him down for a nap a minute ago, but I'm not sure how it will go. We will have a weird schedule all day, I'm sure.     &nbsp;   I'm going to try to post a picture or two that I took yesterday. He was being exceptionally cute last night and I just couldn't resist. This is such a wonderful age!     &nbsp;   I still haven't played around with the features of Blogger and all its related software yet, so this is still pretty plain-Jane.     &nbsp;  Lucy, if you're reading this, hi. :) I hope you're doing well and are happy.     Hard to believe Zach will be starting 5th grade in only two weeks. Also - hard to believe how much STUFF he needs before school starts! You should see this year's supply list... I guess you just gotta love the back to school shopping season... if you're a retailer, that is.

       Now this thing is making me look stupid. It says "post successful" but then I view the blog and nothing is there. 10 minutes later, it's there. I guess I need to be more patient. :) Anyway, it looks like I finally got a couple of pictures uploaded, so maybe my streak of bad luck has ended. We'll see!     &nbsp;   Don't you love the "hose illusion" picture???

       I don't get it. I really don't. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong.     &nbsp;  I will keep trying, but so far I am having no luck with uploading pictures to this blog (as you can probably tell by the... um... lack of pictures).    &nbsp;  It's a lazy Sunday here in Memphis. Not as hot as it has been the past few days, thankfully. I wonder what I'll be doing for the rest of today.

       Well, it's Saturday. I haven't messed with this blog much since I set it up yesterday. I did try - unsuccessfully - to post pictures using Hello. If you can tell me how to do it I will certainly listen. It managed to post the caption but not the picture...   Anyway, I'm having a CM workshop tonight and I have much to do to get ready for it, so I shouldn't be sitting here posting!     Have a great weekend. ;)

      Hi there.  I've never had a blog before, and I probably don't have any real use for this one, but what the heck. My intention is to use this as a centralized place for information, updates, and pictures for my family, friends, and CM clients. Constructive criticism is welcome. I haven't looked around this website much so there are probably all kinds of features I'm not even aware of yet. Feel free to clue me in if I'm doing something the hard way.  Have a great Friday. -Megan

      Okay, Amber has put the photo galleries up on her website from the photo shoots last Monday. You can see Nicholas's gallery  urlLink here , and I  strongly  recommend that you go look! I like #55 the best, I think... of course I like others, but I really like that one. And look at the BLUE EYES in #103! I wish there were more pictures of him in that last outfit. You know, that was Zach's when he was a baby.  Okay, I need to quit writing and go work on my CM stuff now. I am teaching a border class on Monday night and I don't even know what borders I'm going to do yet. I was only expecting one person, but I found out at the last minute last night that two more people will be there. That's good, but I have a lot of work to do between now and then!  Do Good &amp; Win!  -Megan

       And so it begins. Today I sent my oldest son, Zach, off to start 5th grade. His last year at his elementary school. I had to go to the bus stop with him to talk to the driver about which stop he can use. Thankfully, that went just fine. Zach even got on the bus and left without telling me and Nicholas goodbye!      Later this morning I took Nicholas to a photo shoot. Amber Parmley, of  urlLink http://www.parmleyphotography.com/ , was doing some complimentary photo shoots for members of Mommies of the Midsouth ( urlLink http://www.mommiesofthemidsouth.com ). She does really great work and I can't wait to see the shots she got of Nicholas. We kind of turned it into a mini playgroup, since there were so many of us there all at the same time. It was nice. We didn't leave until a little after 1, then we came home and Nicholas had his lunch. He didn't sleep during his morning nap time, so I just put him down for his afternoon nap a little early. I hope this time he actually does sleep.      I should be sleeping, too. I only got 2 1/2 hours of sleep last night, thanks to the latest book from this man:  urlLink http://www.harlancoben.com . I just COULD NOT put it down! So I was up until 4:15 this morning reading the whole damn thing. I knew at the time that I would regret it today, but I just couldn't help myself. I'm actually doing better today than I expected. I'm sure I will crash early tonight.      Well, today's post sure does seem to be full of links! I wish I could embed the link in the text...maybe there's a way to do that and I just haven't figured it out yet.      What else is new? I know I haven't posted in several days so I'm sure I'm leaving something out. Well, the fence is finally finished. It does look good. We probably have some touch-ups to do, but overall it looks really good. I'm glad we did it. I guess my next big project will be Nicholas's room. We'll see.      That's all I can think of right now with my sleep-deprived brain. I hope you had a good weekend and your week is off to a good start.      Do Good &amp; Win!   - Megan

       because we've done it. Went okay, I guess. Had a little disagreement about the bus stop Zach was assigned to, but in the grand scheme of things it could have been a lot worse.       I had an old-age reality check today while I was driving. I heard "Jenny (867-5309)" by Tommy Tutone (  urlLink  http://www.tutone.com/   ). There was the line "for the price of a dime I can always turn to you..." and it got me to thinking. I actually REMEMBER when pay phones cost a dime! Which led to the thought yeah, and I remember when they went up to 25 cents, and then 35 cents... which made me wonder how much it costs to use a pay phone today... which then led to the question of do they even HAVE pay phones anymore?!? With the popularity and ease of cell phones, does Bellsouth even bother putting pay phones out anywhere? I can't remember the last time I saw one, much less used one... and then by this point in my train of thought I started feeling really old.        Lots of things make me feel old lately, though. Like realizing that my big brother/best friend in high school is the dad of a now-16-year-old daughter! I remember when he and his wife told me they were having a baby... (Hi Russ and Judy!)... time flies when you're having fun, huh? I've been out of high school for 17 years. I laugh to the point of tears at the "I Love the 80's" series on VH1 and think the "I Love the 90's" series has come out just a few years too soon.       I am definitely an 80's girl. Granted, I wouldn't be 14 again for anything, but man, those were the days.       Okay, I feel a big rambling bout of reminiscence coming on, so I will end for today. So long, be good, and be careful. Or, as my friend Elease says, "Do Good &amp; Win!"      -Megan

       Another Monday. And now it's August! Where has the summer gone?!?    But - Zach is home now. :) That's a wonderful thing. Nicholas is really happy, too. Tomorrow is registration for the new school year. That ought to be real fun.Can't wait to find out how much 5th grade is going to cost.    Well, we started staining the fence this weekend. It looks GOOD! It's going to be great when it's all finished.    And, Nicholas got his third haircut last night. He didn't let me cut the back, though... I will have to try to do that tonight.    In case you're interested, here are some news articles that (for whatever reason) are of interest to me:          Missing Utah woman, Lori Hacking, update -  urlLink http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20040802/ap_on_re_us/missing_wife_28         Scott Peterson update -  urlLink http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20040802/ap_on_re_us/laci_peterson_1         And for my British friends out there -  urlLink http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=573&amp;ncid=757&e=6&amp;u=/nm/20040802/od_nm/whale_dc          That's about it for now. So, until next time, be good and be careful.    That's how my grandma used to sign all her letters to me.         -Megan
