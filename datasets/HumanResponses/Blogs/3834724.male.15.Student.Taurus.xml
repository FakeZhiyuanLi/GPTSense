       Quite sometime since I posted here. Seriously, nothing personal to talk about ler.. Usually post in xanga, *if* you are interested, just head there okay? Anyway, what's wrong with you? This morning with your -_-' face. It's weird you know. We both never been that quiet before. lolx. Always laugh and talked like no body business whnever we both are together. Erm, so I heard you were sick, when I got my terrible flu yesterday =.=" Today during meeting, got serious bad headache. -_-", anyway, our duties are going to rotate. So no worries. Any duty problem just tell me, okay? Take care please, don't ever get sick again hor. lolx. Seriously missed you man. Where have you been? Better not call you, right? What if your dad picked up again =.=" Later you kena sasiat.. lmao! Hmm..kinda weird nowadays anyway, -_-" No talking no nothing. *sigH* HOw long is this going to continue?? Or will it be permenant? *not your sick anyway* 0.O O.o lalalala... Whatever it is, do take care of yourself. lolx.

       So, I know I'm wrong as I did not really reply what you said. First I told you I'm having sour thoart, didn't I? Second, after that, I talked to you and what did you reply? "Call you some other day." "Nothing to talk" "Nothing." "Ic." "Ok" and yada yada yada. DAMnIT!!! I'm so fucking pissed off and don't ask why. I hold my tears as I do not want to cry everyday for no fucking reason. I was glad at first you called, but you ended up ruined my night. Or should I say I ruined my own? I don't know and do not want to know what was in your mind. I asked you whther your "IC" and "OK" shows that you are no longer interested in continuing our conversation, and you bloody throw me a "yes". It hurts alot. I hung up as you wished, and you bloody call back just to tell me "bye". Are you trying to piss me more or what? If you have nothing else better to say, don't call.&nbsp; If you have nothing else better to do, call people whom you trust, not me, the one who you no longer trust. Is not like I'm telling you not to call me anymore, but that's just all your wish as because you think I'm not worth to talk with. It's like a "fine" to me, as I don't have to power to use a gun, and point at you, and begged you to call me. I enjoy talking to you, but today seems to turn upside down and don't ask me why. I just don't know. Maybe because you're stressed with your studies, and so on, and I'm stressed with prefectorial board, homeworks, families, friends, and everything.&nbsp; Maybe I did sound very sleepy when you tried to tell me something, but I did change after that. I'm just so sorry and I don't think you want to continue reading my blog. So, bah, that's it. Tatz.&nbsp; &nbsp;  *wrote something yesterday night, right after you call me to tell me "bye". Suddenly felt like something bad is going to happen once again, or should I say I think too much. Anyway, writing out everything is one of my ways   to release how&nbsp;I feel. Bah, I cant post it here, 'cause I'm blur with this system. I uploaded it in the upload site. Go see if you want. Or I *think* I'll send it to you. Bah, whatever. Tata.

        Suddenly decided to post. Today, during Addmaths,  &nbsp; it's like a total disaster, when Hemma came in and tell me we can't get the bloody  gong.  Hemma bloody promised to go to school at 215, to have a talk with Siti Hawa, for the  gong.  She did not turned up. I was in the prefect room, with all the kids around, and looked like a total idiot to sit there doing nothing. At 245, I gave up, and went to Siti Hawa alone. She was eating. Talked to her, and she told me the  gong  is not with her, after looking at my puzzled/worried face, she finally told me, to see her Monday or Tuesday to comfirm. Went back and brother told me someone called. I called Hemma and, argh, I'm sick of her. Can't she ever tell me earlier when she knew she can't turned up? Bah. Whatever. I went online at 300, and whatever. So sick of it. Soon, Tiktsin came online, and I talked to him. He got pissed, lolx. And I told him I'm sick of everything and there he goes, yada yada yadaing around. I know I shouldn't tell him, because everything will naturally goes back to Santhi. Bah. Who cares.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was seriously pissed, but who cares. Haahaa. What so ever lar.   I've been crying over small matters nowadays. Almost everyday, my tears dropped. I mean, most of the time is about prefects. I'm being dramatic, yeayea, I know I know. Bah, so? What so ever.  Anyway, I'm starting to love  Georgia.  Heehee. And wow, since when I can change font here? And add up pictures, and and, everything. lolx! Laalaalaa.&nbsp; Brother brought back one big bix of Anime, and asked me whether I like Anime or not. -_-" I was like "Depends lar" -_-" Laalaa. He might want to use the Pc later. *yawns* Need to wake up before 700 and need to reach school by 700.&nbsp; Hope Hemma doesn't come late  again,  or inform me if she can't come or any changes of plan. And pray hard Ganapathy bought all the stuffs we need for the banner tomorrow and the stick from Iggy. And I'm not very prepared, but need to be prepared to get voiced from Santhi tomorrow. Tt said he will back me up. lolx.&nbsp; He thought he is the great? No comment. *Take a deep breath* I'm prepared, to get scold. Oh well, maybe I'll still write or..cry after that. =P Hey, that's  me . Beh.  No idea how long I need to get rid of that bloody banner. Hmm.. and how many times we need to rehears. Hmm.. Because of this, I need to change my piano class to Tuesday at 600, hope I wont forget. And need to fnish up my Theory, plus practice. I did not touch my piano for, like one bloody week. I just can't make myself move. Like what my tuition teacher said, mind is suppose to control our body, but our body is controlling our mind. *slaps* Lalala. And I just found that, I can't get anything from bab6, Addmaths. I did not pay attention lately, which is kind of abnormal. And did not fnish the whole bab of homeworks. Laze is seriously dragging me around and I just can't make my body move. Bah!

       I'm so sick of it. DAmnit!! I went to meeting and Huiwen told Tt about our duty, classes, we can't take them, 'cause it is seriously out of control!! So fuckit. He changed my duty during recces, I headed back to the canteen, and I *think* I heard you are not in the toilet anymore, guess Afifi will remain. Nah, don't tell Afifi anything about it, the sick bastard will imform you guys later anyway. Just act like you don't know anything as you are not suppose to know anything from our meetings, bah, I know I'm telling you, and so?? I don't give a damn. He was like "Liwen, canteen." As for classes, everything remains. I was like 'what the fuck!' I called Hwen and she said "I don't care." and then close her mouth. I walked to her after that, asking her how do I bloody survive?? And then, Mich went shouting at Tt, telling him I've got problems. I walked to Tt and asked him how it is possible to take 4A11 with Kityee only? He bloody answered, 'I know at first is like this, later you'll get used to it.' I seriously got pissed and I sat lazily on my chair, holding my damn pen, writing down my fucking duty. Hwen came and asked me to calm down. And then, Hwen was talking to him but I don't give a damn. Stood there and wait for Hwen and then in canteen, I was so angry and Hwen asked how. I was like 'I don't give a damn, if he thinks I can, can lar.' Hwen said Tt told him we do not need to WALK in the lines. Great, so he mentioned that, so I need not go in though, and stand there like a useless stone and ended up get fucked up from Mr.Mohan. And when teacher ask, I'll just say "Tt said we do not need to go into it." I don't care. It will be a mess. I did told him, I can't. It's like, fine, he don't give a damn, and why must I give one to him?? Hwen asked me to calm down and to lepaskan geram, asked me to wait for Tt in the canteen. I go 'Why must I?? Don't give a damn. Dowan to talk.' And walked to Hemma. Deb was there though, so what? Tell Santhi lar, as if I care. Sack me, I don't care anymore. Go tell Santhi I did couple with John, sack me or whatever, I seriously don't give a damn. Being a normal student is seriously much more fun. Complain lar.. Bluek!! So well, Darren, just to warn you, he hates you alot already. He said we don't have enough guys, and Hwen went, 'Why Darren in 4th, we in last?' and God knows what he said. He said something like, dunno what let Santhi do what shyt lar. Who cares anyway. You take care, dear. But seriously remember, I'll always always be with you. You are on the top of everyone, including John, but excluding my family =P Muaks.

       Oh well, can I name my si journal? Bah, lemme think of one later. So well, did not post for, not sure how long. Hmm, since I seriously got nothing to write about, let's just re-tengok what happened lately. Banner bAnner baNner banNer bannEr and banneR!! -_-' It was a torture, but in the brightside point of view, it is fun. ^^  Anyway, I hate to admit this, but I think I seriously get jealous pretty fast, or should I say, that's me? I'm not sure, blek, lazy want to explain everything in detail. Maybe it's just me. Bah, don't care lar. Anyway, John asked me to go to his house, with his sleepy face. But I said I need to do something with the banner and he goes, okay. So I said I'll call him when I'm back, I called him at 400 and he was sleeping, as usual. So, he asked 'You want to come?' I was like 'It's 400' He said 'Yealor' then 'You let me sleep lar, I call you tonight.' -_-" Oh my, thnk you John!! lolx. No comment. Don't care lar. He don't bother to call nowadays though. Blek. Anyway, the one and only fella who is reading this, please don't go to him and goes, 'John, call her lar.' PLEASE, no!! I'm lazy to explain why, but just don't! We both, or should I say me, made a big mistake by telling Anittah, Afifi, Hemma and Yucheng about we both coupled. -_-' I mean, I don't actually give a damn, but, what about you? -.-' oh well, no comment. Yucheng acutally tells out that she thought I coupled with John, which I think she actually believes me and you are couple, don't she? Oh well, go spread spread!! -.-' Soweee.. Anyway, you started it first. -.-' Oh well, I tokok tambah it. sowee ya. Anyway, mom is going to bake durian cake =.=" but she is lack of..dont know what cream. lalalalal, and today's cinnamon i brought to school from home is so not nice, but my friend said it was great, and ended up finished my food. Lalalala. I'm going to hate tomorrow as I'm going to take over 4A11 and I did not buy the bloody useless dicipline book yet, teacher said the dateline was Wednesday, didnt she? Blek, don't care.

       Very fucked up. Tomorrow, I need to fnish up the banner thing, and yet, I still don't have enough people to help me, and there's extra classes for form 3 and form 5. Blek! No colours yet, and no idea when Iggy is going to buy the fucking clothe. John told me yes, when I asked him whether can he come on Saturday yesterday. And last minute, he fucking told me "I'm going for movie tomorrow" I really got fucked up and upset. I can't find anyone to help, I mean, I don't have enough people, WhaTever! I'm so..whatever lar.. I can't stand it anymore.. Why on earth is everything going upside down. Fucking Gana promised to show us the bloody color sample, and he forgot it. Bloody bitch santhi shows her face, telling us she wants to cost to be the lowest and the best quality, come on lar, fuck, which century are you stuck in?? I'm tired looking at your fucking bloody bitchy face, and pretend to love you so much. On the way back, John was holding my bloody key, and then I tried to tell him how upset I was, because I thought sOMEONE is helping me, but ended up, telling me he is going for bloody movies. There goes. "You promise me to help me, and now, you said you are going for a movie" "I did not promise." says him. FUCK IT! I hate listening to his sentence, every word and every sentence he said pissed me easily. I said "fine" and there he goes with his fucking apology. I'm so sick of it!! He kept apologizing and answered every bloody question with a fucking "okies" DAMnIT LAR!!! I feel like crying!! I can't stand anymore.!!! Life is fucked up as usual and it will never be simple and happy. Maybe, I should throw bloody "happy" out of my dictionary, as well as "love", and let "evil" and "anger" replace it. I can't think. Feel like dying, yes, suicide can settle everything, but leaving other people to suffer. Yes, it is selfish and I'm running away from reality. Humans are borned to be selfish!! And running away from reality is my favy, so shut the fuck up. I've got enough. Everything fucked up my life. WHATEVER.

       Bored as usual. Anyway, can't we change this blog's font? -_-" My ulcer is getting bigger and bigger, and yet, my friends dragged me to eat fried chickens. x-X X-x Went to SP at... at... 2+ and came back at 5, after spending two freaking hours eating. > s .  Anyway, have I mentioned that, I love my nick name? I think I did. Heehee. Hmm..Guess nothing else to write. Boring..  ::|[MisëräblëPrincëss]|::

       Too boring, so decided to post a journal, or do we call it blog?? Whatever. Did not bother to finish up my homeworks again. Being laze all the time is fun.. Yay!!One thing I love writing journal is, releasing all the damn anger or writing out my happy/sad feelings, since I don't have one to tell. Another reason I love journaling is, whenever I read back my post, it is fun. Sometimes, I knew what I did was wrong, sometimes, laugh at myself for doing something real stupid, and sometimes admiring my own sentence. -_-" Sounds dumb, but fun.  John did not call me for days. Oh, he did call me up this morning, asked me whether to go out or not. Er, what I mean was, did not call up to talk or something?? No idea. **yawns** I found out something *I think*, I don't put trust on John, neither do him. He dislikes telling me everything. I know, he might want some privacy, but seriously, he doesn't want to share a thing with me. Example, he went Sunway Lagoon yesterday with gm and friends,  , to bring up conversation, I asked him about it today, and he is not willing to tell me. It is very obvious that he doesn't want me to know anything. I don't know. I mean, how are we both going to survive by keeping secrets to each other?? I dislike apology without reasons, it pissed me off easily. I don't know how to explain, but... I don't know!!! Oh, well, I love merajuking, ya know. But, I dislike doing it in front of John, because whenever I *tried* to merajuk, what I get is "Sorry, my fault, my fault" I mean, I don't know, maybe he is sick of my merajuk-attitude. I hate to admit, but I enjoy merajuking to Darren more than John. **yawns** I don't know, I need to find ways to communicate with John... *better* ?? I thought a couple is like, erm, other than loving, is... understanding each other?? He sometimes really don't give a damn to everything and anything I do, and it makes me want to make him give a damn by doing something real stupid. Blek. Darren said he wants to change *again*. And I hate it. So, I admit I do not know the "real him"... But come on, he is making himself lame. -_-" I'm serious, 'cause whenever he tried to change, the difference is very big. I don't think is a need to change, as long as you are happy. Oh well, except for my laziness, although it is happy sometimes for not doing anything. **=P**  Yadayadayada... Brother and sister want the bloody pc again. After this, I'll go upstairs, pack my bag, and check my undone homework.  If  I  can , I might finish it up.  And, I love my current nick name and the corak in this blog. =P Is like, so nice   Will keep this blog update *I think* ::|[MisëräblëPrincëss]|::

       Anyway, please, there's no offence, the post below. That's just what I feel. I'm not asking you to change or so, I still love the old you, you got what I mean?? I've no idea whether you read it or not, and I'm not going to go, "Have you read it?" from msn. But do tell me, when you read about it. I still love you, as who you are. Keep on rocking. =P Don't misunderstand what I said before that, 'cause I seriously have  no  offence. =P *Actually, I spotted a slight change from you, or maybe it's me* Meh, tats.

       BoOo!! Anyway, suddenly feel like blogging. Mom told me, dad is going to scold me anytime, for hanging too long in front of this bloody box. Meh. Do you think its easy to throw this habit? Man, I'm addicted to online, what do you expect? A day to change everything. Please give me time. Now, let's see. I hate to admit this, but I'm telling the truth, yes, I did fell in love with Darren, once. Yup, once. But, come on, that's just once, and that's it. Now, John is mine, and mine + mine, is still mine. I don't care whether he cared about me or not, he is still mine. Who cares if he run around with other girls. Once we are still together, he is still mine, until we break up. I *think* I know why I fell into Darren, for that one and only time. Simply because, we are toegther, like everyday online and ect. I can be with him all the time in school, kicking each other and talking plus laughing. I can't do that with John. That's the reason. So, automatically, I'll tell him everything. Duh. Meh. And I'll *try* never to fall into him, again. So, now, I like Darren and even love him, because he is my brother and that's it. He loves Punthon and that's it. And please, I dno't angry over Punthon. You are not that great yet, for me to get angry over the girl you like. John is mine, Punthon is yours. Clear? Don't mess with my boy. From today onwards, I need to avoid from telling you things about John. Might need some time, but I will change. 'Cause I don't think it's worthed to tel you, plus I don't think you're  that  interested.   I don't mind you telling me what you want to tell about Punthon, but when I'm just not in the mood to listen to you, you'll know what I'll reply. But that  doesn't  mean I'm angry at her or jealous on you guys. As I said, again, you're not that great, for me. Please mind your words, 'cause some might be real sensitive. I've got a boy, remember. I need to give him respect. I admit I always play around with my classmates with 'i love you', no matter is a girl or a boy. But they never take it seriously, so you don't need to do so, too. Ask John if you want. I don't say 'i love you' to him always. I seldom tell him so. I only tell him when I feel like. That is why, it makes my 'i love you' a little more worthed, compared to his. He always say so, but so? That's just me. I don't need to go and tell him, "Make your confessions more meaningful." I used to do so, but second thought, it's his way, so why bother? So, same to everyone, the more 'i love you' I say, the less meaning it got. That's what I think. Do you see me telling my mom 'i love you' everytime I see her? No, I don't. This doesn't mean, I dno't love her. But during her birthday, or Mother's day, I do tell her so, even kiss her sometimes. Isn't that meaningful? Compare to telling her 'i love you' EVERYDAY, and NIGHT?! Nah. Gimme a break. That's my way, but I dno't expect anyone to follow it. Meh. And sometimes, I have to say, I'm very sensitive. I think alot, even with an 'ok' a person said. That's me, me and me. Don't ask me to change, 'cause I love being myself. I don't know. When I'm writing this blog, I'm not angry or happy. I don't have any feelings when I wrote this. This is just, something who appeared in my mind, suddenly, and something asked me to write it down, so I'll feel much better, and won't be thinking about it, when I'm on my bed. Actually, I'm weird. I dont show my feelings. Great examples, is like my boyfriend. I always pretend not to care, but this doesn't mean, I want to have a fight with them. In people's eyes, thye migght think I'm cruel, but please, that's between me and him. Leave me alone. =P Anyway, to whoever I'm going to show this blog [I'll decide myself], please don't think you know me very well, and kept telling me, "I understand." or what so ever, 'cause it pissed me off, alot. And this are hints, when I'm not-so-happy about what people said on phone. 1. I get silence after your sentence. Either its because it's boring, and I no longer want to contninue it. Or I'm speechless because of your annoying attitude or what so ever. Keep that in mind. But! Sometimes, just sometimes, I need time to 'tafsir maklumat', ya know, my brain sometimes is resting or under construction, I need time to think what you're trying to say. =P 2. Don't ever repeat something you know I won't like. Unless I started that on my own. Like waht I said just now. About the silence thingy. When I'm silence, dont go, "Oh, I know you don't like what I said, sorry." or what so ever. If you knew it, SHUT THE FUCK UP and try to cahnge another topic or use your brain how to continue that conversation, or I'll just hang the phone up, and go to sleep. Meh. Tats.

       Need lots of stress-releasing-confessions. La. Nowadays, some particular thing is driving me a little not-so-happy. I've no idea why it hunts me suddenly. I just don't know. I don't want to know anyway. Bah. Maybe I'm too sensitive. I can't take jokes? -_-" Entah lah, apa aku nak. I'm trying hard to forget that particular thing, so I could stop bugging myself. I'm so blur. Problems are coming again. I'm losing all my friends, again. Or should I say, I don't have any? Indeed, fingers could count how many real/true friends I had before. Perhaps, one hand is more than enough to know how many true friends I've had before. Plus, I guess Darren is leaving me, sooner or later. I just don't know. I do think everything has an end. It just depends on, whether the middle of that 'everything' is sweet, or a living hell. And whther it has an happy ending, or a torturing ending. Actually, I stil don't know what I want. -_-" I'm looking at other people, feeling envy, and asking myself, why they could have what they want, or perhaps, they are not desperate to have something/someone, but they got it, automatically. I just don't know. I think jealousy in me, is getting stronger and stronger. I might turn either evil, or crazy, someday. Let's see. I'm so the great in giving people advices, but I can't tell myself what to do, and I don't have anything/anyone to guide me. Let's see what else my problem is. Studies, love and yada yada. Basically, all the problems came from me, myself. Like study, I don't even bother to fnish up my homework. And I don't think I could ever move my body to my books, as exams are not here yet. I'm a last minute fella. I can't do things until its last minute, and time is a factor. And love. bah, dont ask why, I seriuosly have no idea why I'd coupled with John. Great question. Even my sister asked me so, since I've got so many problems with him. Should I say it's my problem, or his? Should I say, I'm asking too much, or he did not do his part, as a boyfriend? I don't know. Argh. I think I'm making things big, and I knew I shoudn't. But what can I do? Everything just pops into my mind when I'm alone. When I'm alone, doing nothing, what I could do is, think. Sometimes, maybe it's just me, to think too much. But sometimes, I think I'm right. It's just my problem. Meh. Who cares about me anyway? I'm sick of people who pretend to care about me. I know, having someone to care about you, no matter is real or not, is sometimes touching. But, poo, I'm selfish. I'd like someone who really care about me to care about me. I'm sensitive. I can't stand lies. If someone lied to me, and if its very seriuos, I forgive, but will never forget. The trust will never be there again, no matter how long it is. There'll still be a wall, between me and that particular person, if he/she lied. La. I don't know what I want right now. I don't seem to miss John, but if you asked me to break up with him, I think I couldn't do it. Please don't ask why. Sometimes, I'm madly in love with him, but sometimes I don't feel like looking at him. Sometimes, I missed him more than everything!! But sometimes, I just don't feel like talking to him. To be honest, sometimes, I missed Darren more than him. My sister even told me, why I coupled with John, but not Darren. Excellent question. I told my sister, simply because he is my brother, and he is younger than me. After that, I thought of it, alone. Asking myself, why I coupled with John, when I missed Darren more? Why I'm with John, when I think I don't love him, and I couldn't continue any further with him? Why I'm with him, when I know he flirts around and actually don't care about my feelings? Why I'm with him, when I know he loves bragging, and will never be my dream boyfriend? Why wHy whY and why.. WHY?? Everything comes into my mind, suddenly, and I can't give myself a good reason. Sometimes, I seriuosly miss Darren, I don't know why. I once, tried to hate him, but it doesn't work, and will never work. I missed him even more when I hate him. -_-" I hate him  Pah. Guess something like this, make me feel  a little  better. Anyway, I've been thinking about the farewell party next month. And I'm looking forward to it, -_-" don't ask why. Maybe because I'm more into prefects this year, plus it is going to be held at night, till midnight! Wow, rock it baby, rock it! Just hope we'll have loads of fun on that day. Wee... I'm just lovin' it. =P bah, 30 mins updating this blog. -_-" Is it long? and damn, my oral. Teacher is so unfair, to put the first guy [from namelist] in class, and the last girl in class go first! Unfair uNfair! unFair!! unfAir!!! unfaIr!!!! unfaiR!!!!! and UNFAIR!!!! Poo! I hope teacher give me chance to have a little excuse, which is 0.001% of chances. Meh. Tats.

Butwheniminlovewithoutyouknowingnooneknewhowifeltthough,includingyou. Thisislifeexceptitasyoudonthavethepowertochangeanything. ItoldyouIratherkeepeverythingtomyselfasIknownoonewillunderstand.

Maythesweetmemoriesbewithme. SOOO!!!InsteadofactinghappyandgetallthepainIshallmakemyselfnumbIshallmakemyfeelingsnembsoIwontgetfurtherpain."  La~~ it might take you quite sometime to read huh? lmao. Anyway, I need to stop making things big. But, this is the only way to released my feelings when I'm upset, angry, sad, happy or whatever. Teehee. So, enjoy your day, and please, take care of yourself, your health, and study smart. May God always be with you. May Luck always by your side. You can do it!! You are still the best in my heart. ^^ At last, but not least, the same old boring sentence :  "No matter what happen, I'll always be with you, as you've won a place in my heart."
