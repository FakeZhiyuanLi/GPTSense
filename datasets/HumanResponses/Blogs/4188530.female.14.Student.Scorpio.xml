        Hmm... if your wondering about the dance (whoever is reading this) It went great! I got to know more people and I had a blast, but I still don't know how to dance. I guess that be another goal... let's see goal number 834. Heh heh. Anyways today was interesting I found out I'm almost getting an A in marching band. Yay! I think I can make it. Oh great now I reminding myself of that train thing. Going on. Umm... I went to the drumline car wash that was interesting cause I stayed with them for most of the time and I got to chill with the pit people lol... Well this may sound a little down, but is it just me or do you get the feeling that everyone gets everything better. I'm pretty sure that's just me but it really kills me. Probably just whinning about it so it's not that important just that. In marching band I'm sort of alone (yeah I know sort of sad) I tried but I guess I don't know it's not natural and I don't want to force people to like me cause they have to deal with me for however long they are there for. Everyone is so nice and that could be just the way they are... You just never know and so I stay with myself alone in my caption. It sucks cause I feel more like an outsider than a fellow brass player. I mean no one has been mean, but I haven't really found someone I can go up and just talk to. They're either in woodwind or percussion... and that sucks. My section is great couldn't ask for a better one, but I get the feeling that they're better off without me. They bond together more, they bond with other freshman more, and I just watch laugh and smile. I wanted to be more unshy this year... I gotten more friends but sometimes I feel like shit. I know it's just me blattering on about  my  feeling but still. Shouldn't you at least be a little happy? That's all folks.

        Well I was cracking up on that but anyways. There's really nothing to type. Yesterday I marched in the rain that was fun. Today we got through October which is the shortest thing ever. Hmm... band was interesting and yet again I've been forgotten and now I'm going to make a flag that saids french horn and someone is going to give me a disco ball! I'll be the best damn freshman french horn player ever... Ok maybe most rememberable. Whatever. Daily rambles. Umm... Oh yeah for all the people who has been watching the Olympics two great things happened last night. One the women's swimming thing beat the world record. That was amazing although my mom and I were cracking up laughing at the line chasing after the person. Also if you saw that dude gymnasnist. Paul I think I don't know but earlier he had fallen off the mat and everyone thought it was over for him but BANG he gets the gold medal. I guess it's true never give up until the very end. This really inspired me for marching band, but I don't think I even remembered but who cares. Now I'm using what's left of my precious time to do nothing till I have to practice and do homework. At least I did most of it last night so I'm happy. Anyways nothing else happened. Other than the fact I don't want the band to switch I'm happy as it is. Well I'm a brass and I must stand up strong and... help the hobos in the tutus.

        LoL Hope my title is interesting cause today was good. Better than yesterday anyways. Morning practice was good. Tomorrow is a half day YIPEE! Today was maroon which is my favorite day. Although in band I was put on the spot by playing this melody part and I can play it, but I get so nervous. Stupid. Why can't everyone just turn around or leave the room. Oh well. Beggers can't be choosers. I think I might've put that in my blog somewhere else but I can't remember. Yeah. Things are normal, but this one thing. It's not that important anyways just caught me off guard. Hmm... I don't really feel like typing to make an point so I'm going to have some chicken. Ok today's message always look both ways before crossing the street.

        For now on my titles are going to be random comments I've picked up during the day for now. I suppose. Anyways, my day was ok. I mean it could've been better but it wasn't. First of all I'm pissed at Mr. Strock for making us do another run-through. Run-through your pots Mr. Strock! Sorry but yeah being in the brass line and all we get to be in the back and while we're trying to get in to put our instruments away the woodwinds are in the way. Well we're fixing the whole thing tomorrow so it won't be a big deal anymore really. Enough about that. Hmm... I realized I did a ton more work than I had to in English so I was like laughing at my whole stupidity. For moment I think I have the feeling of one those people that's like about to blow their shoes off. The school work is finally getting to me but it's too soon. I'm not going to let some stupid paper make me go crazy. If it's a battle that paper wants, a battle it shall get. I think I just declared war on a paper. I thought I still had some insanity left. Although right now I'm dealing with some stuff that's been acrossing my mind so I'm a little better. However there is a moral to this story... can someone get me some watermelons I swear I can't remember what a fricking watermelon tastes like. That's not it but it's better than nothing. How about this. Say No to drugs and wear people in tutus.

        The title has nothing to do with the journal but meh it's a title and if you got a problem... well... why are you reading this? Anyways today was cool I mean yeah I was tired as hell but I had band like all day and I LOVE band. Well I'm not a geek just that I know practically everyone so I can be more open I suppose. Nothing much had really happened unless you think me falling down during practice this band cause I was trying to dodge people who didn't give me enough room and yeah made a fool out of myself. I don't care I've already done that too many times already. Ok I'm watching the Olympics right now and it's awesome I saw United States and Japan back to back so I liked that. However when someone is holding the flag or someone really famous they show their name and what sport they're in for. Some are simple you know like swimming, basketball, track and field, and I think tennis. I'm like cool then there come some of the most riducous sports I ever hear of. I mean shooting and sailing??? Aren't those suppose to be hobbies? I mean come on. So if I go sailing I'm athlete. I might as well make up a sport that requires for you to run into the doors million of times. I think I might win the gold medal. Although I have to admire that they worked so hard to get where they are and now they're in a place that has been taking place for millions of years. In addition, it's a GREAT honor to be there... I'll probably won't ever be there unless I was selling hot dogs or something. Another thing I noticed. We have some interesting country names. I have typed enough so good night.

        Well nothing of importance has really happened. Other than the fact on the way back from morning practice my backpack broken and people were catching my shoes and drill book. I finally had it when my water bottle fell out so I kicked it and yelled at Shauna to pick it up. (Sorry about that by the way) Anyways waking up at 5 isn't so bad anymore now it's just trying to make it to class on time. I won't worry about that for now though it's almost the end of the week and I'm glad enough that it's here sort of... On other news I'm sick. What started as a simple sore throat turned into a nasty stuffy nose and me sniffing at every second. It's hard enough to remember everything I had to do. I have duties and I attend to finish them all. I feel like I'm giving a speech or something. Heh here's something funny my dog is walking on the computer. Here's what she typed "bbv b ncxghnjb b vv" Lovely isn't it. I'm going to do stuff I have to do instead of talking to a screen so who ever reads this. Go buy some of those really squishy pillows at Chandler Mall...

        Well guess what? Marching band started today. *Joy* Yeah no... I think I did good I mean all I did was fall backwards and my lip only just jabbed into my bracket with the hook on it too. I'm just complaining it's going to get worse anyways so why should I care? Wait nevermind I might as well sign up for some club named Panties Hose... That's besides the point. I think I have a real topic to type about today. Someone be happy for me. *Crickets chrips then leaves* Going on... I know it's not a really big topic but it just been bothering me plus it kills time oh fun. Yeah but I know not  that  many people have changed but some have and I mean by a lot. I mean yeah change is inevitable (sp?) Hopefully you catch my drift. Changes are good even though they not the changes we want. If you think about it imagine yourself from the past years... how you've changed your looks, your personality, everything! If you haven't... then get a life! No I'm just kidding. I guess it shows you don't like change but that's ok cause I'm an accepting person, I think. Ok I'll come up with something better to type about for now do something else.

        I've returned to type nothing really. My back hurts from carrying the stupid textbooks. Well at least I got a ride from my friend, Nicole which I can't thank enough for giving Grace and I a ride. A part of me is saying Alina you know you're suppose to do your homework you know what. Then I just eat another cheetos. Gosh they're good. I went shopping for the remainder of my supplies needed for school. I hopefully got everything cause my mom sort of rushed me out of the house once I got home. While we were there I was pretty damn annoyed cause I forgot my list at home. I have a feeling that typing more will not help so I think I'll be off doing my homework. I'll more to type. Maybe.          Side note: I get to wake up at 5 in the morning oh joy.

         Hello all. Not many people know that I have a online journal at another website and I started to feel like that was pointless so I'm starting a new one here. For the new school year get it? (Yeah I kinda got the website from Natalie... I hope she won't mind) Anyways school started today. OK that might've been a really stupid comment but it's true. These 4 years will determine our whole future. I hate this. I'm doing my best and that counts. YEAH RIGHT! Sorry about that. I don't really have much to say. Usually my entries are very long and pointless. So if you want to kill some time just come here and read what's going on in my simple little life.
