      August 18, 2004  It's only 3:30 pm and it has been a busy busy day.  First of all, my niece Meagan has left. She had been visiting me for the last 10 days along with her best friend Amanda. Apparently the two of them ran into some MU boys last night at the grocery store who invited them to a party. Me being the cool aunt, allowed them to attend the party with only a mild warning not to drive with anyone who was drinking and that I would pick them up if they needed me to. I also instructed them to be home by midnight since we had to be up at dawn to trek to the airport. I then waited for them at home picturing what my sister Patty would say when she found out that I let her 17 year old daughter and her 16 year old friend go out with college boys that I had never met. As luck would have it Patty called me shortly after the girls had left. When she asked for Meagan I casually mentioned that she was at a party and that I would have her return the call when she got back. After a few seconds of silence Patty said ok. It was almost a let down. The woman lives for drama. The girls returned home shortly before midnight full of stories of the cute guys and how nice their house was and how nice everyone was. I gratefully fell asleep and dozed until the alarm went off. Apparently the girls spent the next several hours talking to the guys on the phone.... I remember those days of teen romance... *sighhhhhh* The next morning I drove the two hours to the airport listening to them chatter about how they were sorry that they were going and how much they were going to miss the boys...... excuse me.. but who just funded this vacation??? They redeemed themselves at the airport by hanging on my neck and telling me that I was the BEST aunt.  Secondly I got to work to the usual drama. I had the audacity last night to send out an email questioning the effectiveness of a procedure that sent several containers of inventory to CA instead of NJ where I needed them to go. The finger pointing and flurry of emails of people covering their asses was rather amusing. Luckily since I never delete an email that I may someday need, I had documented proof of where the blame lay. Not that he ever excepts responsibility... it's always someone else's fault. He went roaring into one woman's office screeching about her incompetence and her culpability of this problem. She called me in a panic and I calmed her down and forwarded her a copy of the original email to him sent several months ago showing where he had indeed been notified. He's not used to people standing up to him.... especially women. He's such a chauvinist. Something I'm sure comes from his Indian heritage. We all talk about how he's very polite to men but talks down to women. He'd better watch it. If he ever tries to come down on me, he's in for a nasty surprise. I'm meaner than he is... and I'm usually right.  Third thing.... Several years ago when I was in the gun industry, my company sponsored two young Olympians. Josh Lakatos and Kim Rhode. They practiced at our shooting range and they were a great help to me when as part of my position I was required to join the company shooting team and compete. I'll never be great, but I became a respectable shooter because of their teaching me. That year (1996), Kim won gold and Josh won silver. At the time Kim was the youngest American to ever win a gold medal. Now she has won her 2nd. I'm proud to have known her. She's such a sincerely nice person and very down to earth.  Now I'm heading for home. The question of the evening is.. do I want to go home and collapse? Do I want to go work out and do I want to meet some friends for a movie tonight at 9pm. It's called Coffee and Cigarettes. It looks good.. but I'm soooo tired.

      August 16, 2004 ... Cont'd.  I went to my first state fair this weekend. I've been to fairs before in California. I've walked through animal pens holding my nose, eaten corndogs and cotton candy and ridden enough rides to make me sick. But there were differences between the LA county fair and the Missouri state fair. For one thing, the LA fairgrounds is much much bigger, there are more buildings, more vendors and fewer beer gardens. The guys were different too. I've never seen so many NASCAR tshirts and bad haircuts being covered by a variety of cowboy hats and ballcaps. I couldn't believe how many of them smoked. Being from California, peer pressure has made smoking a bad thing. Smokers hide their addiction at home because it's not permitted in public buildings. There is such a stigma attached to it. In Missouri however, young men and women walk around with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths ala James Dean. It's kind of sad.  They take their 4H much more serious here in Missouri. Girls had submitted their homemade prom dresses for judging. I can't remember even knowing anyone in 4H when I was in school, much less knowing anyone who had made their own formal. A couple of the dresses were well made and showed a nice sense of style. Most of them however.... My niece (Meagan) is visiting me from Calif. She just graduated from High School and therefore just had her senior prom just a few months ago. I remember the chaos of getting her ready. My phone was ringing off the hook from her, her mother (Patty) and my sister in Vegas (Susie) who foolishly had agreed to help sponsor the shopping trip. Meagan's heart was set on a slinky form fitting, back cut out, sexual billboard sign that was guaranteed to bring all the teenage boys to their knees and make their elder male brethren stare at her from the corner of their eyes. Patty, her mother was drawn to a princess style dress. Something poofy and lacy that would have been in style during her own prom years. A fight ensued and the tears, accusations and yelling intimidated all but the most stalwart of sales people. Susie resorted to calling me to referee from several states away. They ended up settling on a 3rd dress that was princess like, but was still clingy and still guaranteed to cause woody's to her male following. Several hundred dollars and a shopping spree later, poor Susie vowed to never speak to either of them again. Susie broke the deadlock by offering to pay for the dress herself, but only if she liked it. Patty is a cheapskate so she caved immediately and Meagan trusts Susie's sense of style. Of course now that Patty found an "in"... Somehow Susie also became responsible for the expensive Victoria Secret push-up strapless bra and the shoes... and Meagan's pleading also made her responsible for fresh highlights in her hair and a pedicure. Susie called Jeff her ever patient husband and told him to not open the credit card bill when it came in if he didn't want heart palpitations. I of course was no dummy. I knew something like this might happen so I graciously had previously volunteered to send $100 to help towards the cost of the dress and the pictures. Meagan is my godchild after all. I'm sure that if Patty could have thought of a way to do it, she would have hit me up for more money... But I already knew what Susie had shelled out. And I wasn't budging. And now that I've rambled on, getting completely away from my subject which was the state fair. I just couldn't imagine Meagan sewing her own dress for something as important as the prom. Actually, I can't imagine Meagan sewing period. Her future dreams include being an anchor woman on a major news show with an incredible clothing allowance and being able to shop in Manhattan. Meagan is an incredibly beautiful, tanned, toned California girl with the common sense of a flea and the averousness of Imelda Marcos. God help the college boys.

      August 16, 2004  I am now 40 years and 15 days old.  I feel like I'm at the beginning of the start of the second half of my life.  In the days leading up to my 40th birthday I had Gastric Bypass surgery, I took a trip to Vegas with my girlfriends to dance and gamble my way into my  40th year and I spent a week traveling all over southern California visiting friends and family.  I even spent one day at the beach soaking up some serenity.   I've decided to write this blog because I feel as if I've made so many  momentous decisions lately and if I don't record them for my own posterity, the awe I feel right now will fade and I'll have lost something that right now feels so important to me.  Besides the fact that I'm rather vain.  I don't expect anyone else to read this, but I'm too lazy to write in a physical journal.  I know this because I've started dozens of those over the years and I've never gone more than a couple of days before it becomes more of a chore than anything else.  Let's see how long I keep this one up.   Now about myself.  What do I want to write here about me?  I'm a 40 year old professional business woman.  I'm living in Missouri but I'm a Southern California girl born and raised.  I'm single, dating but not committed.  I'm attractive and look younger than my age and since my surgery I'm the rapidly shrinking woman!   I love to write poetry, take art classes, go to plays and concerts, old movies.  I'm a former musician who will always love music.  I love and appreciate beauty in it's many forms.  I have many many friends whom I absolutely adore and a large extended family that I'm irrevocably tied to.  I'm the eldest of 6 children and I will always be considered the peace keeper who every one runs to when conflict inevitably arise.  Even a move out of state obviously does not relieve me of that obligation.  We lost our mother in 1996 and the wound still hurts.  Our family is an obvious Matriarchy in which the men can't compete.  They are completely ruled over.  Luckily we love the men in our family and do our best to take care of them.  The poor dears.  I have 4 strong willed sisters and a brother who keeps choosing to marry bitchy women.  I think my brother somehow associates bitchy with strength.  And since he's been surrounded and controlled by strong women his entire life, he somehow feels as if that's what he needs.  Instead he gets women who take advantage of his chivalry and he always gets bewildered when his ex wives take complete advantage of him.  We'll enough about him.  This story is about me.  My Book of Days.   Until next time.....
