						   San Diego, Calif. July 4, 2004 -— Author Brian Snelson and illustrator Rodney Sellars of teen science fiction novel “Shaturanga” are conducting research for a sequel that has lead them on a hot-air balloon ride high across picturesque San Diego County.  It doesn't get any better than this! Well, at least not for Sellars and Snelson as they geared up for a research excursion aboard a colorful seven-man balloon and hung for three hours with the happy-go-lucky crew of Sun Balloons Inc. “We needed to do this for the sequel,” Snelson explained. “There are scenes in the book that involve some pretty fantastic balloon ships created by Rodney, so we just wanted to get the feel of going up in the real thing.”  Rodney Sellars will be illustrating the sequel as he did with the first book, “Shaturanga”.  “Do we get to wear parachutes?” was Sellars’ first question to pilot (Frank) before launch. “Don't worry,” Frank said, “we'll be flying in one.”  These two authors are dedicated to delivering the best possible story, and they believe that firsthand experience is key to writing a believable scene. “The view was spectacular,” Snelson said, “and some unexpected events from other passengers, like a marriage proposal, added new grist for the story that we otherwise couldn’t have imagined.”  Snelson took some pictures and video as they drifted quietly over the surreal landscape bathed in the glow of a lazy, hazy sunset.   The sequel, code named S2, due out in 2005, takes us far into the future after the Earth has succumbed to a new ice age. S2 picks up fifteen years after the closing scene of the first novel “Shaturanga”. The oceans are gone, wiped out by an ancient cataclysm of unknown origin, leaving mankind to start over from scratch. New and unusual civilizations have risen as Lars, the fifteen-year-old King of Earth, sets out on a voyage aboard a royal balloon boat to prove himself worthy of kingship. If successful, he will find his queen-to-be that lives in a fabled city on the far side of the world.  With this intriguing concept that will tackle some difficult issues, Snelson and Sellars identify with today’s teen audience, relating to issues that teens and their parents struggle with every day in modern society. Just as “Shaturanga: The Story of Onus” dealt with values such as responsibility, trust, fortitude, and moderation, S2 will examine the values of leadership, unselfishness, endurance, and of the coming of age.  Snelson draws his inspiration for the story from personal experience at a young age. He is passionate about the tough issues facing teens, and of learning how to get the most out of life in an ever increasingly hostile world.

						   With the conclusion of "Shaturanga: The story of Onus," an exciting new super hero is born. He shall serve as the Guardian Knight of the king of Shaturanga, and he is known as "The Mighty Bogotron".   It is our goal to see TMB spin off into its own comic book series. We are looking for a good publisher interested in working with us on the project and will be pitching the idea in upcoming forums like Comic-Con International.   The character is a "Biomechanoid" or cyborg, with a human head and robotic body. He is fully modular, capable of adapting custom&nbsp;appendages for special applications.&nbsp; His body armor is impervious to impact, and his weapons are as follows:   Wields the Scepter of Onus (scepter that can transform into an ax, and has other powers).  Houses a miniature black hole generator in the center of his chest plate (converts enemy to light before sucking them through in a peal of thunder).  Super strength ratio: able to lift 100 times own weight.    urlLink http://www.shaturanga.com
