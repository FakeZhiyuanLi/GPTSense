      Thats right people, one of my ahem... "Sources" I got Adobe Photoshop 7.0. I'm so happy, I've already done some stuff. My current "piece de resistance" is Influence, see it on my DA gallery  urlLink Here! &nbsp;And, I finished the database. Yay!

       Just a small update. Well I set up a re-direction thingy, except that the header is awful it says "The WebAlias Network presents: Kahvahn Online at kahvahn.up.to". I tried a dotTK but it said that I already had an account for my account, which I don't and cjb.net is introducing ads to its pages from August 1. This ".up.to" will be ok for now, unless I can get into dotTK.    &nbsp;  On another note, I've almost finished the database for the YouthWork magazines, which is good *Yay £5!*

       Some of you may actually be viewing this via my incredible (j/k) website. ( urlLink Here ). So I'd like to thank you for that, if not, WHY NOT! GO THERE NOW!     Anyway, Cyp gave me 100mb of "Phwoar" and I plan to use it for many a thing! From Freelancer to NationStates to deviantART. Today I sent every thing for my new &nbsp;website from my Angelfire webspace to the Anima stuff, so far it's working well, and with the help of Korijn, I think it will be good! I just signed up for a Tag Board, I may get a dotTK in a minute and my 50 Schizophrenic Personalities (The Senate) are deciding whether (or not) to create a forum.    In other news, I decided not to go in town with Laura, shes gettin her tongue pierced and wouldn't be able to speak, and I probably don't know any of the other girls so it would be a waste. Also, some random person just added me to his MSN   urlLink  jimmygoodein@hotmail.com  . I think that will do for now.   ¯°¤~-_Ќαħчǻhл_-~¤°¯
