      Hello, this is fifo again, bored as hell, and falling assling here. Don't be expecting daily updates, only 2 times per week maybe, i don't know. I want to see 3 movies, the spiderman one, they say its really good, and dodgeball and whitechiks, but i don't know if i'll be able to go this weekened, and darn Yvette canceled our plans once more, and i sure dont feel like going to the movies with the guys, hell no. But oh well, blah to that. For the meanwhile, i'll clean my house on friday night, and watch movies in my dad's room, and saturday, just knock myself out of boredom.  Damn it, i've been gaining alot of weight, i don't know why, but all of the sudden, i've been getting really hungry and i have stop going to the gym, but starting next week, i'll be back on track hopefully. Chemistry has become easy, naming elements and chemical equations which i am very proficient at. But then again, they get harder and harder to crack, but i like it! its fun to work with those things hehe. Just 13 more days of school left and i am gettin the hell out, thank you lord. In prospects of continueing education, i think next week i MIGHT sign up for a course at UTB, hopefully they still have that SAT class, i really need to take it. Anyhow, i am really bored out of my mind, and have nothing to say, so might as well just leave. Good bye.

      I just don't see how faith (which i believe is a good thing) can even be associated with organized religion, much less what drives it. organized religion seems to stand against everything that individual faith achieves: a better understanding of one's self, an increased objectivity because it is an individual thing, and really just a development of the human intellect. it takes work to try and understand how faith works, and the human mind tries to rationalize faith in higher power(s). it's interesting how faith is supposedly hand in hand with organized religion, when (from my observation) it seems to try and destroy the individual effort to attain faith.   my view of organized religion has continue to sour over the priest scandals, the fundamentalism that is causing so much death in the world right now. Well my friend and i discussed this a lot because she went to catholic school up through 10th grade, and has kind of a "falling out" with religion itself since coming to sja (which is, ironically, a catholic school). i just don't get it. i watch the news, and i see religious fundamentalists telling me that when they behead an innocent hostage that they're doing the work of God? bullshit. Then again, they deserve if for stepping foot in the wrong place. I am a spiritual person, but i can't understand why any rational person can possibly have a faith in a single church. don't they understand that their faith is misplaced? when the KKK said that lynchings were all part of "God's plan," that was bullshit, wasn't it? When i'm told that gays should be discriminated against through a federal marriage amendment because "God doesn't like them," i call bullshit on that one. i mean, if i had a girlfriend right now i'd be free to marry her now simply because i turned out to be heterosexual. what makes homosexuals so different that makes them somehow "inferior" to the point that they shouldn't be able to enjoy the rights that i enjoy now? answer? nothing. it seems that organized religion is only able to fuck up peoples' perceptions on what faith should truly be. i believe it should be an individual belief that one continues to debate and challenge in order to remain objective in light of anything new that comes up. i don't need a church to tell me what my faith should be. i can do that on my own,(Irronically i am Catholic)  and i think that only makes my faith stronger. wow, kind of a long entry, but it felt good to write down anyway...  I had a debate conversation with a couple of atheists (that includes sylvia) and then with a couple of christian extremeist, thus the entry.

      Hello, well i figured since my xanga was getting old, and its open to the public (all my friends) i decided to make this one secret, perhaps i write better here. But then again, i know i'll be sharing this one with someone else, all for the good fun. I still need to learn how to control this site, so i'll take off now, and explore, goodbye.

       some song lyric goodness:parody of an angel,miles above the sea,I hear the voice of reason,screaming out to me!Thrice - "The Melting Point of Wax"     Good afternoon, sorry for the delay of long inactivity in this dear bloggy of mine. I've been quite occupied lately with work since i am hired by my parents and threatened not to get paid if I show low signs of "working" mood albeit with long degrees of rest.&nbsp; So what have i been upto lately? Not much in particular, like i said, work. Oh, and verging into politics and speechles. I think i will join hugo and his political party for this program "kids vote usa"? I don't have much background on it, but we plan on making some type of pep rally at the mall (a political pep rally) and except a poplulation of 23000 teens. (right). So this friday we will be meeting up to see what's up? and yeah, that's ok. I might be going to matamoros because daddy and mommy has doctor appointments, and most likely we'll end up having a great nice dinner, yep.&nbsp;I guess this is all i have for today, not much of an update, but its something, so peace out.

       Finally, Amen, school is over.  But sadly, i think i'll miss it, i met such awesome interesting people, from different high schools, i think i even had more fun here in summer school than what i did this past regular school year at Rivera. Josh my pimp dawg (from middle school), victor the other pimp, Nicole my virgin slut, K.C my&nbsp;bitch stalker partner and Amanda the quet fun baller oh and Yvette T, the young dangerouse rebel (shows rivera spirit), we were a good group, but i dont think i'll hang around with them much, except with Nicoel who gave me her number today, but i am pretty sure we'll see eachother next summer school year, so we plan to.&nbsp; Anyhow, enough of this corny shit lol going on...  Well, today we were suppose to go bowling, but Jorge's chick stood him up, Miguel never awnsered his phone, Tania never called me, and Mariano was a broke bitch. So we postponed to NEXT week, damn it with these people, these guys suck, but oh well.. i have no other biatches to hang out with. And LINDA IS OUTOFTOWN, but she's enjoying herself, so that's great.&nbsp;And right now i was talking to Yvette, but she's a mesed up girl, emotionally speaking and just too soft? Ay I dunno.. but its wierd when you try to have fun for awhile, she gets all freaked out ot things i say.&nbsp; And speaking of emotions, guys i deserve a pat on the pack, i have 1 month that i have no love feelings for Yvette.. isnt' that great? Its wicked awesome! And i don't plan on crushing like this again, NEVER. Now its all about having fun and enjoying myself. Okay, i do have to admit that i did have a crush that lasted for 2 years in 1/2.. yeah its crazy, but that was l.ike 4 years ago, but its all for the good fun. Oh i got a new pornstar name, "FiFi Foreplay" LOL. yeah, it sounds cool, and i feel like in that mood right now for someting i just heard on the phone with someone. Aight my lovers, i must go, c-ya arounds, goodbye.   &nbsp;

Lesbian action!! Joeizza and Maria, getting it on like hardcore.. ok fien lie, but they were together by themself enjoying, so we pass by and interrupt just to say hi, and we went upstais and theres a turn going upstrais, so we hide there, and they get caught by security lol.. but then they stay there, and we're all watching and hearing them.. awesome show, but then we started laughing so we had to leave because they were coming our way.. we got 5 mins late to class and got myself a 3rd tardy lol.. but 2 more days and i am out all! thank you very much, beautiful.&nbsp; Anyways, this was the story of the day, goodbye.

      Good afternoon to every loving soul, what's up? lol.. Today i did nothing important, not much in particular happened today. I only went and ate at Blue Shell, which the food and service totaly suck, but oh well, my brother likes it, so we went and ate with brother and sister in law. After that we come here to my house, i take a 10 minute nap, and i connect, and no one interesting is online, so&nbsp;i open my bloggy thing, and start typing whatever that comes out of my ass just for you chantal, because i love you so fucking much, and i don't want you to say updateless lol.. so yeah, i hope you're having fun where ever you are, i don't recommend the island though, its hell outside. Anyways, i think i'll be in my house the whole freaken day, my parents would take off elsewhere, so i'll enjoy some direct t.v and loud music.  &nbsp; Oh yeah this dude, his name is Valentine lol, he's from that YLC thing, he called to ask where i was because i was suppose to attend some meeting at some Crystal Garcia's house (the name sounds very familiar, chanty or rox do i know her?) but i said i couldn't go, due to insufficient funds ($400) Well MY PARENTS have the money, but they're not going to pay that much for only 4 days, so they're like FUCK IT lol.. so this guy calls, and i told him the situation, and he insist in negotating this, perhaps at a cheaper price, so tomorrow theres going to be antoher meeting and maybe i'll attend it. And i tell my dad, and then he throws a tantrum aruging why BISD doesnt' pay for this shit and what not. And well, he has a point, we're paying out of our taxes over some $15000, i'm not sure.. so yeah, but sitll its only 400, and if i join i automatically get a scholarship, not bad huh? so yeah. But oh well.. Lets see what i'll await next. Alright guys i am done, thank&nbsp; you fellow loving readers for reading me, love you all. Good bye.&nbsp; Oh chantal, do i get a cookie now? hehe

      Good morning on this nice bleak sunday. Today is one of my aunt's birthday, so my dad decides to invite her out for dinner somwehere, place undecided, maybe Johny Carinos. Island sounds good, but weather is unconvincing.   Anyhow, last night I talking on the phone with Yvette around 11:30, and i don't how the hell, but my voice was audible enough for my mom to appear in my room, and ouch. I attempted lieing by saying that i was the radio and i was singing along to the tune LOL, yeah stupid i know, but she didn't buy it. So makes sure i had turned off the phone and that wasn't on no more, and she leaves. I was being wary and observant for any movement or sounds, i waited for 10 mins and i called her back for like 3 minutes, and out of the fucking blue, theres my mom, holy shit she nearly killed me. I thought i was going to die since my dad prohibited me the use of phone after 10, and threatend my priviladges. So we're all aruging, me trying to be very silent and trying to quiet my mom before she woke up my dad, lucky she didnt wake him up. So then i had to go leave the cell to my dad's room, i was like, im dead right there, so i motioned to my dad's room extremely silent, and leave the phone and managed to get the hell out without being caught. And yeah, mom goes back to bed, and i returned back to mine, praying that she wouldn't say a word today. So far, pretty good, she's being silent about it. Thank you lord. Gosh damn, the things i do for people.   Bush's in deep shit. I FiFO, would like to file a lawsuit against George War Bush, President of the United States of fucking America. For reasons of; False evidence for war with Iraq. No true links between Al-queida and Saddam Hussein. For the lives of 1000 of valorous soilders lost, and innocent civilians of Iraq. For secretly changing his payrolls files and business dealings. There's much more where that came from, but i lost the resources. And if that does not suffice, go see Fahrenheit 9/11.  FiFO vs. U.S Government. National Case.   And this is the end of my rants, i'll come back later. Have a nice day, good bye.

      Okay, today i found out that i had made friends with a bisexual girlfriend lol, i was caught by surprise, sorta. She all of the sudden just started telling me about people she knew and had relationships with. Pretty good fucked up lesbian action, 5 people dating eachother in different times lol nasty, i happen to know some of them.   Anyways, i think i will stop using the phone at night and start studying, cause im sure going to fail if i dont pick up that 65, oh well lets see what happens. Anyhow, oh rox remember Maria from IWA.. well i met up with her today lol i was with Chantal and gang and then she's there. I didnt' know who she was until chantal introduced, she didnt know who i was though.. so we just hung in there. Then everyone left except for chantal, me and Maria. Then chantal's ride is here (a porsche) so Maria grabs me by the arm and asks to go with her to drop her off, so i go wth them, and then WE just hunged around..She has a hot body, but her face screws her up, she looks like a woman of 45 hmm She's a valley's slut too, so i think i might have some fun? lol.. Oh well, lets see how that goes. Oh and I can't go out tomrrow.. Parents Aniversarry. So saturday will do. Well,g2g, bye.

      I finished "the da vinci code" yesterday evening. i actually liked it a lot. i don't read very much , and when i do, generally it's fiction that can be "linked out" (heh, such a debater geek) to the many non-fiction books i read. but this was actually one of those book where i enjoyed the story line as much as i enjoyed the historical information in it. i devoured that book in four days on top of doing chemistry h.w and not studying for a test that a failed, i spent reading that book hehe. I couldn't put it down. normally i'm only like that with really interesting philosophy or history books...heh, am i nerd? guilty as charged jk ;) i think i'll check out some of his other books. If they're even half as good as this was, then they'll be worth the time it takes to read them. you can tell i'm excited about this book. it's VERY rare for me to read a GOOD  fiction book and like it this much. the last time i remember being this way about fiction was when "The Secret History" by Donna Tartt, god she was write like a glory.   Anyhow, I might go out this weekend, bowling with the dudes perhaps. If not i got 2 choices, 1) go see F-9/11 by myself since my friends are't really upto those types of movie documentaries (don't be stupid) or 2)Call Karina like i had promised her and go out and see a cool movie. Alright, well i have a huge test tomorrow so i will go study for awhle, and then come back and enjoy some sweet bread with coffee hehe.. good for the diet ;) lol.. g2g bye.

      Today was sufficed by going to the movies and watching dodgeball. Went with Yvette and her little brother which they gave massiv loads of sugar or something) Enjoyed the movie, it was very hilarous, not the best though, but it was satifying. We wanted to see spideran, but tickets sold out, and then whitechicks was playing in inconveneant times, so yeah ended up with dodgeball. Then after that, went to find this girl cloths, and holy cow its HARD lol.. And then we played some airhockey, we got tie rounds. And after that, we went for some ice cream, and headed for the entrance to get picked up. So yeah.. today was alright. Oh, and i had asked my dad nicely, permission to let me go to the VX cause i was offered a ride, but then instead of tellimg me no like a civilized man, he had to yell it out on the phone saying some other shit in front of my aunt that's a special guest that came down to visit.. moron Anyhow, i am going to watch some tv, c-ya around.

      Recently, i've been identifying myself with someone, i can be myself, i can disclose withouth preocupations. I think this is really great, because i haven't had someone to get along splendidly well when it comes to communication devices and just plain talk. Hopefully ourfriendship continues to max, and that it won't let me back off from other people that i also need and care for.   Anyhow... Right now i'm at home, we had a/c breakdown, so i got some people fixing it. There's really not much to do here, just be here in front of this thing typing, or watching some tv, and listen to music. Tonight i think i'll be night outless, i want to go to some VX to see some people, but dad said No. Then he gave me permission to go out to the movies? WTF why not VX instead? Oh well, but then again, i have no company for the movies, so might as well stay home again bored, and take care of my grandma while parents go out partying.. morons, not fair, oh well.

       Ah What's up!? Yeah, this is fifo and I am bored. But i guess you already knew that one, eh. I wish i had some interesting highlights to update with, but i don't have much of a life here at work. My summer apprantly pretty much sucked for me, as i thought in the beginning otherwise, i was hoping some partying here and there and just messing around.. but only like 4 times i went out and 2 of those times i actually enjoyed my nights, sad right? lol.. and we're already in August.. oh well. And my weekends are pretty much boring, nothing exciting happens, but that's alright with me i guess, at least i go out and see people. Tomorrow Linda, Tania, me and Jorge might go out for dinner, that's IF Tania is able to go out so that Linda can go, or vice versa. Uh why?...that's not cool. BUT if that doesn't work, i guess this time for the reals i'll call Karina, since i'm always ignoring her, and we'll go out to the movies, yep.  And then Saturday Jorge is inviting is out again since he already invited Yvette out.. EJEM, (i thimk someting is heating up) But i don't know.. I think i like saturday nights to stay alone in my house and watch movies on direct t.v. But oh well, depends how bored i am.  Oh by the way, a short note to those avid readers, if you read or about to read on the Da Vinci Code, some of the information is incoherent, and you must buy that extra book that reveals the true facts on the hisotrical events.       Something is up with this fucked up internet of mine, it keeps disconnecting every 5 mintues, stupid crap. And my xanga is not functioning correctly, the graphics in my layout are ruined.. im just wating for SOMEONE coughroxcough to help me here lol.. its alright, i can wait. Anyways, umm i think i will end here, thank you for reading my rants ladies and gentlemen, i love you all. Good bye.

       Good, this bleak humdrum monday is nearly over, leaving me rejected and ready for the night it holds. I think i'll sleep early today, i don't plan on having late phone chats, well at least not for the week, except for the weekends.  As you have already guessed, i am incredibly bored, in a state of blahness. Nothing interesting has happend besides just work. I called a friend today, but she never awnsered her phone, so i will attempt one more time in a little while. ...I hadn't slept in in a very very long time. As each day passes, the reality of school coming up gets clearer and clearer...I don't think that I have had a busier summer, maybe that is why I have felt it go by so incredibly SLOW.. I can't wait to return back to school, i know alot of hard work will be awaiting for me, some things are going to be different, but its okay.. i want to get back in the routine - like, seeing your some "friends" that didn't have the desency to call you at all durring the summer, or the ones that i invited out, and rejected every invitation with lame excuses. Also, like maybe getting a stupid teacher, and making fun of his/ her behind her back with your best friend. (Linda, remeber with mr. castro lol i was like OH SHIT!.. ) and like hanging out after school, like making fun of people who talk about "who's goin out with who" and etc. Fun fun.Ive been noticing that I write a lot in this thing. Wow, that is how truly bored I am. I have nothing todo. Amazing, music is beautiful. I cannot stress that enough. That is I think the only good thing that the human race has contributed to this earth. Music. We can't stop the Music. Its been raining quite steadyly, i like it when it rains at times, its very relaxing and it makes you exploit your mind and travel in the wonders of imagination and ingite new things depicted in pictures and memories. I feel like writing  an interesting non fiction story of some sort, but i lack motivation.. maybe later i'll get back to the old writing tendecies. I think i've started to alienate myself from someone whom i used to love dearly, i don't know if that's a good thing or not, but i like the feeling. It helps me keep in line and not get fucked up again in the bloody romance of equivocal love. I've been noticing that i can no longer express inner emotions very well like in retrospect of early entries. I guess i need to be in school in order to do that. Anyways, i think i'll end it here. Have a nice day everyone, good bye.

       My love horoscope...    "You may find yourself irresistibly drawn to someone who seems quite opposite. Excitement comes from being with someone who makes you aware of your unique qualities that you may not show very often. Sometimes you seek greater freedom in a relationship, and you like doing things differently. Allowing each other to be yourselves and dispensing with any expectations heightens your appreciation of the magic that exists between you."    That's 87% accurate... gosh damn it.

       Ok, there's not much to post in here, but i want to keep this thing occupied i'll post what i wrote in xanga    "Bowling for last place" Yesturday was a semi alright night, pretty boring though, but it was alright cause i went out.  Jorge, Bilma, me and Yvette had setup to go bowling at 8. Earlier Mayra had called me to say what's up so i invted her along with ashley and 3 other of her chick friends. So when i get to the place, no one was there, but then Mayra and her gang comes (Mayra, Ashley Brenda -myra's sister, and 2 other unknonw characters) And then a few minutes later Yvette arrives, so we're there waiting for stupid jorge, but we got tired and decided to play one game since we all were broke bitches, well except me, but i didnt' want to dish out $30 for the rest to play, so we only played one game. I totally sucked as usual, but it was cause they didnt start the good music and turned off the lights til 11, so it sucked that way, and therefor i didn t get inspired to play well haha.  And yvette here was playing pretty good compared to the rest of us, and being her first time. And it was aroud 9:40 when we finsihed, and guess who calls? the black dumb mother head saying that he was almost there, good job.  But we couldn't stay any longer cause dam mayra had to be home by 10.  So i call my parents to pick us up, and so we're outside waiting, and then here comes jorge all fucking pimp with his awesome looking dodge lol.. i was like whoa whoa no fair! So parents come, and we leave jorge and yvette playing, i guess for another half an hour? i dunno, morons they get to play when its going to be the good hour. So i don't know how i did it, but i got all 5 of these ppls in my truck, and we took off. I think my dad was high, cause he was being like super nice, he was offering dinner and alot of other things to these people, i was like whoa, cause like he didnt want to lent me money, so i had to use my own, and then he's here offering.. moron lol oh well, that's cool. And we arrived at Mayra's place and droped the whole package. And then jorge calls to see if i can coem back, but obviously knowing my parents, they won't let me. So i jsut went straight home :( oh well.. but it was an alright night i guess.. could have been better though.. but its okay, it was fun. Anyhow, today i don't know what are we going to be upto, most likey lunch with family and that's it i guess. Well if anyting interesting happens, i'll update again, just incase you feel like getting bored. Well my lovers, i'll c-ya around, later.
