      Ralf Schumacher has a broken back, not just a concussion as a result of his 250km/h sideways shunt into the wall at Indianapolis.  How things though have changed in Formula 1 safety wise. Imagine that the last few years had been done with the safety standards in place as of 1975 odd. How many of the current F1 drivers would still be alive?  Button? His shunt at Monaco last year would have done him in. Sato... would be the human jelliefish having broken every bone in his body by now. Michael Schumacher too would be dead... he had that nasty head on that broke both his legs a few years back that could have been much worse. Alonso has had a number of impressive wipeouts.  Lets not even consider the wipout at this years Monaco race as a result of Sato's cloud of smoke - Giancarlo Fisichella ended up upside down after ploughing into the back of DC.   All things told, the F1 grid would be lacking a number of familiar faces if earlier era equipment and rules were being used.

      Yes its the blue ferrari - but not quite. The Sauber runs on the current (2004) Ferrari engine due to the 2004 "one engine per weekend" rule. They also use the Ferrari gearbox, Bridgestone tyres are a given and on the chassis front, well they *tell* us that the Sauber chassis has a 4 inch shorter wheelbase than the ferrari but you couldnt tell by looking.  So what IS the crucial difference between Sauber and Ferrari that put Sauber barely ahead of Minardi (and (gasp) Mclaren) and Ferrari clearly the leaders of the pack?  There is however one crucial difference. Ferrari are using Shell. Sauber  urlLink are not.

       urlLink More bad noise  about qualifying.  The teams principals now come out stating that they think the new system sucks, but Bernie asked for it, so when it does turn out to actually suck, we should blame Bernie.  Anyway, this begs the question, why DO we have qualifying for Formula 1 Grand Prix? It seems in the before time that starting order was determined by a lottery. Then qualifying was invented and I can think of two possible reasons.  Possible reason #1: Safety :- With very fast cars starting mixed amongst very slow cars - with probabably the most inexperienced drivers in the field - the potential for chaos early in the race (especially the first corner) is pronounced.  Possible reason #2: Spectacle. No one is going to be excited to see a McLaren overtake a Minardi (unless of course their new car turns out to be a dud). The viewing public want to see McLaren overtake a Ferrari. With a random starting grid however, the top cars could find themselves stuck near the back of the grid - stuck behind cars that they will eventually overtake given their superior speed, but nontheless because its a straight up fight for position the slow car is under no obligation to get out the way and are off the pace enough to totally ruin the fast cars chances challenging other fast cars.

      I wish that I were alive back when racing has seriously hardcore. I mean back in the day when it was glamorous to be a race driver. When there was no television coverage and advertising nonsense to intervene and be a major part of why rules are constantly changed and reviewed. It was pure then. I suppose even then though, that the winners were dictated by which teams had the most amount of money to splash out on materials, engineers and drivers. Some things never change it seems.     Perhaps then, one of the more adventurous changes that the FIA can introduce is some sort of upper limit on all teams' budgets. That should pave the way for a more competitive sport in the future in my view. It would be very interesting to see how competitive teams like Ferrari would then be against say a team like Jordan. I don't think that Ferrari would stop being a top team but I do believe that any gaps that currently exist between teams would be drastically narrowed allowing for more exciting racing. Forget handicaps and such. Rather head towards a plan that makes all teams more equal.     We all know that Michael Schumacher loves winning. Who doesn't? Something caught my attention at the last race in Germany though. The commentators at ITV were talking about the new confidence that Kimi Raikkonen had due to how much better the McLaren was now performing. They then went on to say that it has even had an effect on Michael. I was expecting them to say that he was anxious or a little tense at the new competition. Instead they said that Michael himself had a spring in his step. He was motivated due to this competition. He relished the challenge. Again this is something we've all experienced. Its that much greater a feeling to win when you really worked hard for it. When you were pushed all the way to the end.     You can see from this that absolutely everyone will be better off in F1 if there was more competition. Maybe some of the suits in the major teams will start getting nervous but I think that with a greater viewer interest in the sport, they'll get more coverage anyway and that can only be a good thing. At the moment, I think that even Ferrari and Schumacher fans are getting a bit bored. Who, apart from die hard fans, is going to watch races if they already know the outcome?     Having said all that, there is one other thing that needs to happen to make F1 more exciting. The teams competing against Ferrari need to stop sabotaging themselves. Every time it looks like we have a promising race on our hands, engines blow up, suspensions fail, wings come flying off and pit-stops and strategies go pear-shaped.     As race fans, we can't seem to win can we?

      Seeing  urlLink Kimi Raikonnen's rear wing fly off like that .. I swear I saw two puffs of smoke. I am convinced that someone in the crowd had just discretely pressed the button on some kind of remote detonator switch. The Iceman no more, Kimi was notably uncool after the event. I think I like him more now.    What this means essentially is that BAR, Williams, Renault and McLaren have again conspired to trip over themselves and each other to avoid challenging Michael Schumacher to the end. In a race where Rubens Barichello demonstrated the true potential of the Ferrari by starting low and finishing lower, Michael was there for the taking. Unlike his competitors, the stress of not being in superior hardware spurred MS to put in a stunning dive - his competition either alternately retiring due to rear wing failure, not coming into play due to a 10 grid slot penalty or trashing their chanced (and aerodynamics) by driving over bits of Raikonnens McLaren or their own bargeboards.    Whoot. Good going guys.    Button qualified 3rd (with a heavy fuel load), started in 13 (with the penalty) and finished second. If it wasn't for the (Stupid) one engine rule we would likley have had a different winner.

      At the end of 2003 things were looking up. Kimi was competative in the McLaren, or at least looking like the 2004 car would be good. Alonso was making the Renault do amazing things. Webber too looked like he had a chance to go for the 2004 championship in a Jaguar. Williams dominated and Ferrari were on their back foot with severe tyre problems.  And what happened? Ferrari went away, and did the professional racing team thing. The 2004 season begins and BAR has improved enough that Button now has a chance too. Now it seems that Kimi, Alonso, Button, Webber and Montoya should all have a chance, should all be racing with Michael.  And what happens? Some kind sick circus where every team tries its damndest to be as pathetic as possible. 9 out of 10 races so far this year Michael Schumacher has brought his car home in first place because Ferrari are the only damned team that are professional enough to give their driver a competative car. All the other drivers are languishing in cars produced by teams that seem to belive that its Amateur Year in Formula 1.  I can in no way blame, or dislike Ferrari for their domination this year. I have been a Michael Schumacher fan since he drove for Benneton and I'm not going to stop now just because his opposition is fucking incompetant.  I swear it seems theres some kind of comspiracy in F1 to diminish Ferrari and Michael Schumacher greatness by giving them such useless opposition that they can argue that, when asked if Michael is the greatest F1 driver ever, despite Michaels 7 world championships, at least the other great drivers like Senna or Fangio, at least those drivers *earned* their championships by winning against stiff opposition.  Poor Michael. How much can he value a world championship trophy when he got it because none of the other teams actually pitched up to race him?  Fuckers.

      The concept of handicapping, in the context of handicapping the fast red cars so Schumacher doesnt win the championship halfway through the year, is occasionally brought up, and then shot down as an anathema to everything Formula 1 stands for.  I think however its a perfect fit for another problem - how (at least) to get the fast red cars to occasionally start a little bit further back than the front row of the grid.  Yes - I belive that qualifying could benefit from a handicapping scheme. If Michael Schumacher... I mean whoever is the current leader in the championship standings, were to have as little as a 0.1 second disadvantage to the next driver in the standings - well the front of the grid could end up just a little turned around. And watching Michael Schumacher win races (and championships) after fighting his way from fourth or something, would do more to satisfy my fandom... there is a difference between simply driving fast and not letting anyone past, and, well, making the sort of moves Barichello impressed me so much with last year.

      "Idiotic, stupid". That's a direct quote. It came from Patrick Head. It was in reference to the last 2 disastrous race weekends that Williams experienced. He went on to say that he thought that some time in the future, Sam Michael would make a great technical director but for now he just didn't have the experience or know-how. Reading in to those statements, it would seem that Patrick Head was more than likely forced out of his position as technical director when Williams did their internal re-structuring. What is going on there? Why are teams creating so much conflict within their own organizations? Surely this is going to lead to less efficient development and therefore less success on the track.   Teams really need to take a closer look at how Ferrari does things internally. There is a great degree of harmony there which allows them to move forward. I'm not saying that they are perfect, and indeed sometimes I do get annoyed at some of their politics when it comes to their two drivers racing each other for position on track, but you can't deny that they are successful. Like with normal business entities in the world, the only way to become successful, I feel, is to stop fighting each other inside your own company and start fighting your competitors instead.

      I was watching a local F1 magazine programme on TV last night. For some odd reason, they saw it fit to show highlights of the 1997 French GP. Watching that footage was rather interesting. I remember that when I saw these cars back then, I used to think that they were great. They looked very much like the pinnacle of race cars that you expected them to be. Sure it took a bit to get used to the raised noses (I can't recall exactly which year they started doing this but it was around this time) but they still looked beautiful to me back then. However, seeing them now, in comparison to the F1 cars we have today, the 1997 cars were absolutely dog ugly!  Its amazing when you think about it. The shape and dimensions of the cars (including things like wheels and tires) are dictated these days not only by designers trying to make the most efficient cars they can but also by rules that attempt to reduce speeds, increase safety and make cars in the field more evenly matched (they've failed in everything except safety so far). These cars are made to be highly functional. They were never intended to be appealing to the eye. They look nothing like conventional road cars (which can afford to be sculpted to look good rather then be highly functional). Why then do F1 cars look so damn stunning to me? What is it about these cars (that have just one seat and look nothing like anything I'll ever be able to drive) that is so appealing? I honestly don't know.   It gets even worse when you see them in the flesh (or the metal as it would seem). You see so much more detail than you do in pictures or on TV. I had the fortune of attending the Monaco GP this year. Even though I wasn't right up against the track, I had a great view and could really see the cars well. The current Ferrari truly is remarkable. Its eye-wateringly beautiful. Its lines are superb and almost even delicate in places. I was blown away by how different and inspired all the cars in the field look when you see them for real.  The sound of the cars is another thing worth mentioning. In fact the sound alone needs an essay written about it (I'll spare you that in this post though!). Unlike on TV, in reality, each and every team's cars sound different. They all have their own character and they all sound glorious to my ears (yes, even Minardi have cool sounding engines and exhausts!). I love it. We were given ear plugs with our tickets (I believe you'd get them at any GP you attend). The sound can be especially harsh at Monaco due to the track being quite closed-in by the city (town actually) it runs through. I didn't bother with my plugs though. I could feel my ears on the point of bleeding but I still had a silly grin firmly planted on my face every time a car went by. I had goose-bumps the entire time as well.  Again, the sound of the engines and exhausts are not purposely made that way by the engineers for anyone's listening pleasure. Its all about making the most amount of (reliable) power possible. Why then does the harsh mechanical sound of these cars sound like music to my ears? A beautiful and majestic symphony only occasionally interrupted by the traction control systems throttling the engine when drivers flatten their accelerators coming out of corners. You can actually tell the great drivers apart from the PS2 generation drivers by that sound alone as the more accomplished drivers control the throttle more themselves and therefore ask less of the traction control systems. To my surprise, I found that the car that sounded the best to me was the BAR Honda (I honestly expected it to be the Ferrari). It was almost a smooth sound. I guess you'd only call that harsh shrill noise that I love so much smooth when you compare it to the other F1 cars in the field! I'd place the Jordan in second place for sound. Its just so aggresive! Ferrari is in third place on my list. It was somewhere in between smooth and aggressive.  I started this post wanting to talk about the evolution of the F1 car (which I did to a small degree) and ended up using it as a way to write a bit about my experience of being at the Monte Carlo GP (which I needed to do). I highly recommend going to a Grand Prix if its within your means (if you plan well, its no where near as expensive as you imagine, even if you live in South Africa like me!). Personally, I'd love to follow the circus all over the world and attend every single race in a year. Hopefully I'll be able to do just that some time soon.

						   So what, when it comes down to it, would you say, if you met an Alien. There you are, sitting in your lounge or your bedroom or wherever, and you realise that the slim object in the corner is not your designer uplight but in fact a slender, huge-eyed angular alien, watching you closely and impassively.  You watch it watching you watching it. The moment drags out, tension in the air, you feel your breathing quickening your heart beating harder, time stretching like overworked prestik... you can't bear it any longer, you have to say something, anything, just to shatter this unreal dream...

						   Taken from a Reuters report on IOL:  "Wshington - First there was the girl who fell off her bike fleeing a flying cicada. Then a boy trying to swat a cicada out of the air with a baseball bat instead hit his friend in the nose. The final straw came when another child hurt his hand trying to squish a cicada under a car's tires. Dr Ray Baker of Cincinnati Children's Hospital was convinced - cicadas can be a safety hazard to children."   I'm sorry, but that's so wrong. It's not the fucking cicada that are the problem. IT'S THE KIDS! People, WISE UP. Your children are IDIOTS!  I blame the parents.

						   When you write a song about Irony, and it isn't ironic?  More to the point, the Company at which I work seems to have gotten a "Conservationist of the Year" award.  I find this somewhat confusing. We are on a very large plot of land, most of which the company is not allowed to develop because its a protected conservation area.  So, basically theres all this ground we have to ignore, while we keep our wanton destruction of wildlife habitat isolated to the one corner of the property.  Which means the award is really rewarding us for, well, not destroying as much nature as we might have and no more than we were allowed to.  But wait - it doesnt stop there. The Award itself is a kind of trophy - made of wood - in fact it appears to be a 30cm high trunk of some indigenous bush - most likley one of the protected species - thats had its bark stripped off and been polished and mounted on a base.  How a piece of killed tree comes to symbolise conservation boggles my mind.

						   I ended up roaming through accounts of those kids who snap and shoot a bunch of classmates and teachers. I find it funny how the gut reaction is to blame Manson/Computer games/Movies/MTV/Barney TBPD/Brain controlling rays from Mars.  The more thoughtful (and perchance more intelligent) will consider their home life... as appears to be the case with the more deranged of the popular serial killers, most had a difficult home life. Even the infamous Columbine kids... while their home life looked peachy on the face of things, a closer examination reveals that both kids were underachievers in a home which had an older, star-performer brother. I can't imagine anything that could cause more mind-cracking pressure than that.  However... only 10 - 15% of shaping influence occurs within the home (except in certain unfortunate circumstances, of course). The finger of blame, should we be so inclined as to point it, lies directly towards their peers... the people from which they take most of their self-measuring benchmarks.  School society (as highlighted by sensationalised media) is extremely rigid. The structure is unforgiving to those who, for whatever reason, refuse to conform. A combination of the development of social skills and the pressure of scholastic pursuits combines with the emotional and hormonal turmoils of developing adulthood, and you have a relentless, low level torture ocurring day after day for years.  It's hard enough for those at the tip of the wave to handle. Now imagine you're 'different' in some way. No longer are you just trying to balance on the wave, you're actively fighting the entire massiveness of it.  Me, I'd probably snap as well. Lucky thing I just didn't care enough.

What really concerns me is most of these things are announced when their pass by is immanent. This can only mean one of two things: Option 1 is that the things are really flying out of the darkness and suprising us mere months before they miss (or altnatively hit) our poor planet.  Option 2 is that our astronomer types tracking these things DO know theyre heading our way years in advance, but don't know if the rock is going to hit us or not until its merely a couple of months out.  Neither option fills me with confidence.

						   People who profess to be atheists, and then have children strike me as the worst sort of person. And not even people who profess atheism. Too many people are religeous only insomuch as its a cultural tradition. Their reasons can only be rooted in cowardice, stupidity or utter selfishness. To create life is to kill it. Unless you have some strong religeous conviction.  Having children is, in such a situation, a worse crime than murder. Murder merely hastens the inevitable - birth on the other hand creates something that can only later be destroyed.  I have more respect for the 9:11 terrorists than I do for atheists.

      I was never really a MotoGP fan. I heard the big news about Rossi moving over to Yamaha this year and they weren't doing too well in recent times. Sounded very much like the situation where Michael Schumacher moved from his successful team to a then struggling Ferrari. It got me interested and I decided to watch the first MotoGP of the year 2 weeks back (at home here in SA). It was extremely entertaining and I'm now a fan. I can't wait to see what Rossi is capable of this weekend. Max Biaggi chased him all the way to the end in the last race. I wonder whether Rossi can show more dominance in this race or whether it is going to be another collosal battle.

      After listening to the singles that were released off the debut album by "The Darkness", I found myself in a rather nostalgic mood. Reminded of the great rock from the '60s and '70s I decided that I had to get the CD to indulge myself. I was pleasantly surprised that after you see beyond the novelty of it all, the members of the band prove to be rather talented. I'm very impressed with lead man Justin Hawkins. His searing vocals are suitably moving and while he plays rhythm guitar, his lead guitar work is very impressive, maybe even more so than the dedicated guitarist in the band, his brother Dan. Some tracks take some getting in to and I definitely have not taken a liking to the track "Friday Night". Its just got too much of a "brit-pop" feel and sound to it. The rest of the album is fantastic though. I recommend giving it a listen.

      Well. I've just finished watching all the episodes of the "Firefly" series. I think that it was great. Have no idea why it was pulled from the air. Silly. I watched the un-aired episodes as well. The problem now is that with the season never even completing on TV there was really no chance of a second series which I'm sure the scriptwriters had in mind. That leaves all us followers in the lurch. The story just hangs there with so many questions left to answer. I only hope that the upcoming movie "Serenity" will help us out in this respect. They could be making the movie for one of two reasons as far as I can see. Either they are trying to spark fresh interest from the general public or they are giving the fans what they want in terms of tying up loose ends. I suppose that either which way, fans should be happy.

      So. Here I am. Starting a blog of my own. I used to feed off a really good friend of mine who lives in the UK. She had a blog and it was the easiest way to keep in touch (e-mail can get boring). She'd post her thoughts about what was going on and more often than not these were written with me in mind (how flattering). I have a proud record of posting "comments" (replies) to every one of the entries that she ever put up from the time she started the blog. She always asked when I'd start one of my own but alas I was too lazy to ever do so!  A friend that I work with has convinced me that its really easy to actually start and run your own blog. Thanks Chris. Now I have something else to mess around while at work!   Well, if you ever read this Mel, I hope that you're proud of me for finally doing this ...

      The weather is so incredible here at the moment. I know that its going to get a bit colder which might make things a bit uncomfortable but its still going to be a lot milder than a lot of places around the world. Today it feels brilliant to be outside. Its subtly warm in the sun while at the same time there is a gentle breeze with a definite chill in it. The sky is clear and from here at work you can see out to sea. Its all just so gorgeous. To look at and to feel. Its difficult to describe. I don't know whether it's due to some sort of memories I have of a time in my life that I really enjoyed, but whatever the reason, I really love this time of year. Its also brilliant for driving. Especially if you drive a convertible!

      I'm in such a weird place right now. My creativity has dried up on all fronts. Musically, its been a real strain for me. I haven't been able to come up with new stuff (musically or lyrically) for maybe 6 months now. With music being such a major part of my life, it is really eating at me to be in this state. Its bigger than music though, which is the really distressing part. I think that the creativity has seeped out of all aspects of my life and this includes work. Its a struggle to convince myself to be here every day. This is not what I want to be doing all my life. Not in this manner anyway. So many frustrations that eventually feed back in to the rest of my life.   I'm completely directionless in all respects. I don't know what I want to do on a day to day basis. I don't know what I want to do in life in the broader sense of things. I don't know what I want from the people around me and I don't know what I want from myself. It really is a horrible state of mind. I need to get out of this cycle of madness but I just don't know how.

      I watched the movie "Van Helsing" last night. The special effects were incredible. The werewolf characters were just amazing. The movie was shallow and often predictable (and unbelievable) but I still enjoyed it thoroughly. I'm a sucker for eye candy and apart from the great effects that I've mentioned, Kate Beckinsale just rocked my world. My word she is gorgeous. I can't get over it. The whole Russian thing really suits her! Haha.   Funny thing is that Kate Beckinsale has acted in 2 movies in a row now that have dealt with Vampires and Werewolves (Underworld and now Van Helsing). The movie I'll always remember her for though is "Brokedown Palace" in which she co-acted with Claire Danes. It was the first time that I'd ever seen her and she really took my breath away.  I had a surprise when the end credits rolled. The desktop picture on my work machine is one of a young lady named Josie Maran. She's incredibly beautiful. I know that she's a model and I thought that this was all that she did. Then I see her name in the credits! She played the part of one of Dracula's brides and I didn't recognize her at all. Shame on me huh?  Even if just for the grandeur of the final scenes, I'd say that Van Helsing is worth a watch. Well. I lie. Its worth a watch for Kate Beckinsale alone.

      The problem with having friends who have gorgeous girl friends is that you invariably end up being attracted to them. All of you out there shaking your heads in disagreement and feigning shock and horror, stop it. You are all liars. Of course its happened to you. I know it and you know it. Now that we're clear about that, isn't it annoying to be so close and yet so far? I've come to the conclusion that I have far too many friends with good taste!

      Yay! I found out today that my visa has been approved. I had everything else organised for my trip to the Monaco Grand Prix but I was worried that I didn't allow enough time for my visa to get processed. Last piece of the puzzle in place now. I just need to do a small bit of shopping, pack and I'm ready to go! I can't wait. I can't contain my excitement either. This is going to be my first live GP and what a place to do it all. Monaco! We've got tickets to the place where you can see about half the track. There's also a big screen right in front of us so we don't miss the other half! Excellent. Did I mention that I can't wait? ...

      I watched the movie "Win a date with Tad Hamilton" today. This post is about all that the movie made me think of while watching it. Spoiler alert. If you haven't watched the movie and want to then don't read this post.  In all these "teen oriented" movies, there is always a lead actress who starts off in a role feeling that she is not good looking or important. As the movie progresses she does the whole ugly duckling routine - you know ... turning in to the beautiful swan and gaining more popularity than she knows what to do with. Thing is, in many of these movies, the actresses who play these roles are absolutely stunning to start with. I wish that I could meet young ladies like that. Absolutely gorgeous, down to earth and with a total lack of self-confidence. What a dream come true that would be! Perhaps I need to move to America?  No matter how sweet the movie is intended to be, there also has to be some sort of gross-out scene. Maybe more than one. Stuff like throwing up. What is the purpose of something like that? I don't find it amusing. I find it embarrassing. Maybe Americans do stuff like that all the time?  There was a scene in the movie where a seriously upper class restaurant is visited. There was a brief scan around the place by the camera picking out all the hot women. There was one girl in particular who caught my attention. She looked strikingly like a girl I know. Someone I'm extremely interested in and who has expressed some sort of interest in me. I was just reminded of how beautiful this girl is. She's off in the Far East right now and I'm really starting to miss her *sigh*  The name of the lead female character in the movie is "Rosalee". Unfortunately this brought back memories of a night that I got completely wasted and got up on a table at the [really busy] night spot that I was drinking at and started singing the song "Rosalia" by Better Than Ezra. I was head-over-heels at the time for a young lady named Rosa. Too bad I can't sing. At all. Not even a little bit.  Right. Moving on. Then there's the pathetic loser who hopes to get with the lead girl. Also extremely embarrassing. Normally, I suppose you are meant to root for him because he's the "good guy". The guy in this movie really is a pathetic loser. He defines it I think. I didn't really take to him. I'm more impressed with the guy who is supposed to be the "bad guy". He's just more real. He even seemed decent. Oh, and the "good guy" always has horrid timing and ends up confessing his love for the girl at a time that seems like he just likes her now because she's popular or wanted by someone else. Drop the "seems like" part in the previous sentence and you have real life. Its like trying to get credit from a bank. If you've never had any before you can't get any now. So I guess that you can never really get credit unless you do something to fool the system or maybe something illegal all together. I've seen it so many times where for some reason someone popular takes a fancy to someone who is not generally considered good looking or popular. Before you know it, this person becomes the next biggest thing to everyone. I suppose then that these movies are not incredibly far from the truth. How about that.  Contrary to all my "observations" above. I actually enjoyed the movie (I'm a sucker for these teen movies and I don't know why). The ending ruined it for me though. They completely did a u-turn on the "bad guy's" character and lead him to a painful death (figuratively speaking). It was not really logical so I feel bad for the guy. He got a bad movie deal there I reckon. Would be nice if they did something different and tossed the "good guy" and made the "bad guy" the hero. However, we all knew which two were going to end up together before we started watching the movie so no surprises there really. Maybe I should just be happy for them and move on or maybe I need to remind myself that it was just a movie! Hehe ...

      I managed to miss the start of the Spanish GP when it was on live this afternoon. This was thanks to waiting half an hour for my lunch to be served to me at a take-away. Thank goodness for repeats then. I hate watching after the race has started so I caught the repeat of the race from beginning to end a little while ago. Great stuff. Michael does it again. I can understand general viewers and fans of other teams being fed up of this. They may even be bored by it. Perhaps Ferrari fans too are waiting for some real competition. I see things differently.   Even with Michael out front I'm always tense and concerned about him pushing too hard and perhaps going off the track. There's also the possibility that his car might finally decide to not last an entire race. I hang on to every moment of the race and sometimes will time on so that I know that my hero is going to cross the finish line in front and nothing could possibly go wrong from that point on. I can't help it. I'm that dedicated a fan!

      Its ultimately been a disappointing weekend. I eneded up pretty much alone the whole time doing nothing. Not through lack of trying though. Things just didn't work out. Worst thing is being in this situation with the first work day of the week almost upon me. I really haven't been in the mood for work for ages. I know nobody really is but this feeling I have now is worse than usual.

      I have one sibling. A bigger brother. He has recently decided that he wants to get married. He announced this to my family not too long ago and we met the girl almost straight afterwards. Today my family went over to meet her family. Discussions about engagement and wedding plans ensued after introductions, some polite coversation and tea. It all got a bit too real for me though. I can't believe that he's getting married. Its not that he's too young or whatever. Its just that this signals a hectic change to everyone's lives here including mine. Still wrapping my mind around it all. Maybe I can pass off the way that I feel today to the fact that I had to wear shoes. Hehe. I hate wearing shoes. I guess that this is a natural progression though and it'll all become comfortable and normal given a little time. At the end of the day, the most important thing here is that my brother is happy. And he is ...

      Today I was introduced to the joys of the Mozilla Firebird web-browser by the same friend who got me blogging. What a wealth of information he is! It has all these plugin issues which is why I didn't really use it before but it is so much better than Internet Explorer. It prevents pop-ups which is fantastic and also allows you to open multiple browsing "tabs" within the same browser window. This is great because you can now keep all the surfing that you are doing on one particular subject in one window which makes it so easy to keep track of, not to mention that your task bar is kept neat and tidy. Technology. Isn't it wonderful?

      I've now got Windows XP running fine after a reinstall. Issues remain though. I have an overheating problem with my P4 chip. Great stuff. Did I mess up somewhere, is there not enough air circulation in my PC chassis, or is this a manufacturer problem? *sigh*  This is taking its toll on me. The joy of gaming consoles is that it really defines "plug-and-play". No need to bother with all this stuff. I wonder what I'm going to do about it all?

      I finally decided to upgrade my computer after goodness knows how long (3 years actually). I picked up the stuff today. It felt great. Couldn't wait to put it all together. It was quite a hectic job that. These components are made by the Chinese for the Chinese. You need really small hands for it. Now while I've often been mistaken for Chinese (and I could actually really be one), I definitely don't have the hands. There's ample evidence in the cuts and bruises that my [delicate] hands sustained while waging WWIII with the PC chassis and motherboard *sob*  Well. I finally got the bugger all assembled. Transferred the goodies from my old system to the new one. Plugged it in. Started it up. Yay! No funny beeps and such. Went to the bios settings. Made sure all was cool there. Proceeded on to Windows (XP). Screen stays black for a while. Suddenly there's a flicker of blue across the screen (you can't mistake it for anything but death) and the system reboots before I can see anything at all. Looks like I have to re-install Windows.

      I spent the entire day on course at work today. It was something called "Team Business". A very educational, fun, hands-on, competitive course. It was draining in every sense. We used physical energy as well as mental energy. We were so flat out that we never realised how tired (and hungry) we had become until we wound down at the end of the day. The gentleman conducting the course, I must say, is highly competent and is a joy to learn from. This has a lot to do with his real world experience. He's not just palming off book knowledge on us. He's really teaching us in a very interactive way.  My team recovered from some early disasters to become very competitive at one stage. Some decisions that we made at the very end unfortunately killed us. We dropped all the way to last spot. A lot was learnt though and at the end of the day, our hypothetical company in the course still turned a profit. After the disastrous start, I think that we can't be anything but happy with that result. The competitive devil in me is doing the whole "scream-bloody-gore" thing right now though!  Tomorrow is going to be another full day with this course. At the end of it all we get to tell representatives in our own company how we can see where things can change for the better internally based on what we learnt in the course. Funny thing is, I could have given them a long list of things long before I even knew that this course existed! ...

      Here's something that I find happening to me (I wonder whether others do too?). When I'm "chasing" after someone, I find this person to be interesting in some way or the other. I'm sure that its not just me and my perception but that they are actually interesting. It might be the things that they do or perhaps how they think and the things that they are capable of saying. Even after the prey has been captured and things are moving along, I still find the person interesting. There is a point though - it could be while things are going strong, while things feel like they are headed for disaster or even after things are over - when that person somehow ceases to be interesting to me.   I've often thought that it was just the natural way of things. That because you lose interest in that person, things that they do or say are no longer remarkable to you. I'm not so sure anymore. On becoming aware of the (possible) situation described above, I decided to actually watch and listen to determine what was going on. I'm almost in shock. A person that I found very insightful and intelligent now seems to be reduced to arbitrary banter. Behaviour and thoughts have become so ... ordinary. Has the circumstances of our current scenario caused this person to behave differently? Just what is going on here? Maybe I'm being shallow and fickle about all of this. Who knows? Its just all very strange to me that people are capable of become such shadows of what you remember them being in such a short space of time.

      I wish that this post was about a scrumptious breakfast. Its actually about coppers. I really have no respect for the buggers here in SA. Its ridiculous. The other night I was driving home and saw a police van in front of me doing 80km/h in a 60 zone. Added to this, the guy was also weaving frantically across 2 lanes. On passing the van I looked at the driver and sure enough, he looked intoxicated. My amateur opinion any way. Further to this, on more than one occasion, I've seen a police vehicle driving at night without lights. This was not because the driver had forgotten to turn them on but because they weren't working. They drive around with their hazard lights flashing as an indication of this. Brilliant.  Then there's the on going hatred towards them because of speed-trapping. They stand in bushes well hidden and wait for unsuspecting victims. They should be taken to court under the charge of "accessory to murder". By not properly enforcing speed limits (they instead just use traps as a source of revenue), they are allowing drivers to drive on at high speeds to possible accidents resulting in injury or even death. Thanks porkers. Look at it this way. The way that cops behave when it comes to speed-traps can be compared to a hypothetical situation where they hide with cameras and film while a homicide takes place. They make no effort to prevent the crime. All they have is photographic evidence that the crime took place. Some may say that I'm going to extremes with my example but I disagree. Laws are laws. They need to be upheld. All of them should be upheld in the same manner. Prevention is obviously the proper way of doing it. Instead of real police all we have are opportunistic pigs waiting to profit from crime. Surely this makes them criminals themselves?

      I bought this PS2 title ages ago (maybe about 6-7 months, could be more). I put it in to my PS2 for the first time at around 12pm today. I have this problem you see. I keep buying games but every time I sit down in front of the TV I'm faced with options. Do I watch DSTV, a DVD or maybe switch on the PS2? I often just end up watching DSTV. Sad, I know.   I've decided to change this side of me. I resolve to always choose to play games first before anything else. It worked today. I played for 5 hours solid in a single session. All thanks to Ratchet And Clank. I wanted to put it down and stop several times but as simple as the game is, I found it addictive.  My fascination with these games started a while back when a close friend of mine gifted me with Jak And Daxter for my birthday. I was so addicted to it that I finished it in 3 sittings - 3 days solid of rushing home from work, having supper and then playing until I passed out (usually about 3 or 4 in the morning). I could not get enough of the thing. I loved the characters and the story wasn't too bad. The gameplay was rock solid and could not be faulted. The fact that you were never faced with load times and that the entire game was a big seamless world (from vantage points in some stages you could see just about all the stages in a living breathing world - breath taking) made the game so believable and so easy to get immersed in. It was fantastic.  Reviewers rated Ratchet And Clank as a better game than Jak And Daxter. Some cited reasons such as Daxter being too annoying a character for them to thoroughly enjoy the latter title. Ratchet And Clank certainly has a lot more variety in terms of all the gadgets your characters have at their disposal and their locations are varied in that they are all on different planets. Maybe its because Jak And Daxter was my first taste. Maybe its because I found the island setting of that game more to my liking than outer space in Ratchet And Clank. Whatever the reason, at the moment, my personal favourite is Jak And Daxter. I still have a lot of playing to do to complete Ratchet And Clank and I am looking forward to it. It is far from being a weak game. I think that its great. Addictive. Good to look at. Decent to play (though sometimes I panic and press all the wrong buttons resulting in instant death).   At the moment, I'm really glad that Ratchet And Clank exists and that I bought it. I don't know what other game could possibly have gotten me out of my indecisive mood and got me playing games again. It is so light and easy to pick up and play yet it is so entertaining. Thanks Ratchet. Thanks Clank. See you guys again really soon.

      Yeah right. Whatever. Perhaps they meant that in reference to protecting and serving themselves? Two weekends in a row now I've had nasty experiences with disgruntled cops here in Durban. They've been royally shagged as far as work hours and pay goes. I totally understand. I feel for them. I mean, I know what its like (I've recently been shafted by my company).   Fine. So I understand. I didn't cause their situation. Neither did the rest of the public at large (you know, the ones that are supposed to be protected and served). What do the coppers do in retaliation? They start causing disruptions and major inconveniences for the previously mentioned public at large. The people who pay the taxes that pay their salaries. They set up unauthorized road blocks. When I say roadblocks, I mean it. They parked cars across major entrance and exit roads to the city and refused to move them and were not allowing people to get through at all. This was around lunch time on a Friday. People were stuck in the resulting traffic jams all afternoon. They couldn't get back to work. People missed flights because they couldn't get to the airport and most importantly, emergency services could not move around freely as they desperately need to at all times. Brilliant. Don't you love the way things work here? Where was the higher authority? Maybe the SA Police or the army even? Nobody actually made any attempt to deal with these moronic cops who can't seem to see the world beyond their own damn noses. By all means do something about being treated unfairly but for goodness sake, do it to the people who brought your situation upon you, not the innocent. In all honesty, how different is what these cops did from some sort of terrorist act?  That was a weekend ago. On the Saturday that just passed, I was out driving around. When heading back home, I got caught in another traffic jam but this time it was on a major freeway (one with a speed limit of 120km/h). You don't expect to come to a grinding halt on such a road in Durban. Believe me. I was stuck in this jam for over an hour (thankfully we managed to get from 0km/h to 5km/h every few minutes and were not completely standing still like the previous week's incident). Old people were clearly suffering in the traffic. Especially those driving manual cars. I saw one poor family (clearly on holiday from up-country) having to pull over to the side of the road with an overheating engine and quite possibly a blown radiator (the end of their holiday perhaps?). After all this drama, when I eventually get to the actual road block, there were just 3 lanes marked out with cones and a stop sign somewhere in front. The cops themselves were gleefully sitting on the side of the road doing sweet nothing. How frustrating! I'd have felt better if I was pulled over and searched or something. That way I would be able in some weird way to justify the wait in traffic. Instead, cars were coming in to the marked lanes, realizing that nothing was actually going on and then promptly speeding on their way out of the "roadblock". What on earth was this in the name of? I eventually read in the newspaper that this too was some sort of protest action by the cops. They all need to go dig deep holes, jump in and bury themselves. Idiots.

      As you can see (if you ever bothered to hobble along to my little blog), I've decided to kill comments on my posts. I've been deeply disturbed by the weird trash that some "anonymous" visitors have been littering my posts with. It offends me. I wish that this stupid comment system would allow (and force) non-members to attach their names and e-mail addresses to their comments. Anyhow, maybe I'll put some third party comment system up later, but for now I'm just leaving it as is. Those of you who know me and want to say something about anything I've posted can e-mail me with your comments.

      Its been quite a while since I've made a post to this blog. On returning from my trip to the grand prix I seem to have become excessively lazy. That and the fact that our IT department is throttling bandwidth here (I can actually feel the pressure on my neck) to such a degree that even getting to the part of the BlogSpot website where I manage posts is an excruciating experience.  Life in general right now seems like such a mission. I had such a fantastic holiday and it was all so dream like that coming back to this "reality" has really taken the wind out of my sails. There are issues (large ones) at work, there are issues with my (declining) social life and there are serious issues with this sorry excuse for a country I live in.  I guess I've either got to get over it all or just take another trip. One that lasts substantially longer than 8 days.

      I'm currently making plans to sell my beloved car. The Mercedes SLK that I've proudly had in my possession for 2 years and 3 months now. I plan to live more within my means after its all done. I'm selling up other things of mine as well.     I'm sick of the banks here in SA. They charge you for every little thing and then some. Its becoming harsh and ridiculous. I think that I'm going to close all my accounts and buy a hollow mattress to stuff all my cash in to. I'll turn senile and eccentric early. Live like a hermit. Chase kids off my property with a gnarled, old stick.     I'm sick of this economic world and the this status ladder that we are always faced with. I'm sick of society in general. I am truly sick of working. I think that I'm going to quit my job and be miserly with what little money I have left to hopefully make it through a few months.     I need to get out of it all. Take a step outside the normal world for a bit to put things in to perspective. Figure out what I want to do, where and how. Its not an easy thing to do even if you have time during or after work. You're still in the mix. Still caught up in normal daily life. So much so that you can't think straight when it comes to things outside of this routine life that you lead.     I can't take it anymore. This reality is not working out for me and I need to put the effort in and take some risks in life. After all, nothing valuable is gained without risk being involved. I still have no clue what I really want to do. I only have a starting point in that what I'm doing right now is definitely not what I desire. In all respects.     I only hope that I do eventually find my way.

      I went to the movies with a friend last night. Its been more than a month since I've actually gone out to a movie so I was really looking forward to it. Being a Monday night, the place wasn't all that busy which suited me fine. Popcorn? Check. Coke? Check. Ticket? Check. Great. Everything going according to plan so far.  Before I go any further, I have to say that the weekend that has just ended was a seriously depressing one. I seem to have completely exhausted any sort of luck that I had. Nothing worked out for me. It was really a "gun-to-head" or "blade-to-wrist" period of my life.  Anyhow. So I'm watching this movie and about a third of the way in to it, the movie suddenly stops and all the lights come on in the theatre. My first thought was that there was a power-failure of some description. I was indeed right as the steady rumbling of several generators could be heard. Nobody came in to tell us what was going on or to tell us that we should vacate the theatre. It was ridiculous. We all sat there not knowing what to do. Someone eventually left to see what was going on and came back confirming that the rest of the cinema area was without main power. People slowly started to leave.  Eventually there were just 4 people left in the theatre. My friend and I and a couple sitting behind us. At this point, I said aloud that I felt the next that would happen is that all the lights would go out and we'd be left in total darkness. At this, the young lady sitting behind me burst out laughing. 10 seconds later, the lights went out and left us staring at walls of pitch black all around us. She was no longer amused.  Even with all the lights out we still didn't get the courtesy of someone coming with a flashlight to get us out. No. We had to struggle with the light of a cell-phone screen to shuffle 4 people out from the seat rows in to the aisle and then down some tricky stairs. When we finally got out to an area with some sort of back-up lighting going on, the usher there took the guy with the cell-phone in to another theatre to help get those people out! How wrong is that? I'm glad that these morons are well prepared for emergencies.  We eventually got complimentary tickets on the way out but that is now one completely wasted night. This kind of thing could only happen to me right now. If anyone who was there that night and was inconvenienced by the events that took place is reading this post right now, I sincerely apologize for my being there in the first place. It is my evil luck of present that caused the power-failure. I'm convinced of it. Deep inside of me I know it to be the truth.
