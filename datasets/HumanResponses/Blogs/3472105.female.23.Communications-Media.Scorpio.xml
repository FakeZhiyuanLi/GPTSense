      So I'm talking to my beautiful girlfriend on the phone and she is a little skeptical about this whole blog thing.  I'm trying to assure her that I will only give out her full name and home address, not her social security number.  Honestly.  So tomorrow I get to clean several houses but then I'm off to kick it in Rochester.  My girlfriend (Kim) is house sitting and I'm going to go keep her company.  On Saturday we're going to her friend's wedding.  That should be sufficiently awkward...Hopefully we won't run into any undesirables.  I seem to run into old high school friends every day which is not a positive.  Anyways, I'll give you the wedding update when I get back.  Okay, I am off like a prom dress.  Peace.

      Hey peeps, How exciting, I have a blog.  Apparently these are the new hip thing, or so Rich says.  So, I will put random stuff on here that nobody but myself will find amusing.  Enjoy!

      I'm bored with blogs where people write paragraph upon paragraph of what they had for lunch, so I am going to post many pictures, with occasional thoughts.  Pictures are always more fun anyways, that's why magazines are so popular.
