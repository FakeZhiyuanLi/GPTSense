       was actually supposed to go for st. johns... but i somehow was to lazy to get up... so i decided to give it a miss... as i always did... i was so tired from last nite's riding session as my new Haro Backtrail X1 frame was longer and that meant more energy exertion... need to get used to the bike sooner as my grinds are becoming more n more inconsistent... i even  turned down  Ming Kai, Glendon, Derek & Wei Jie 's invitations to go biking  which i loved!!! oh man... i then decided to watch the  'Blue Crush' VCD  which  Samantha  lent me as i had nuttin ta do then... it was quite nice... couldn't believe i was NEARLY in tears after she completed surfing the pipeline!! lol...  moral of the show was dat if u wanna achieve your dreams, go all out to get it... u can achieve it no matter wad...  =)  watched  'FBM - Albert Street' BMX video  which i downloaded...  it was so sick  as in the people in it are crazy... doin stupid stuff such as knocking glass bottles over their head, eating light bulbs & stapling their own cheek with a staple gun... i immediately deleted it after watchin it... those guys r juz so stupid...  sick sadistic asses ... felt bored so starting writin this blog thingy... juz ta keep track of my life ya... there's something special about to happen... i can feel it!! =D  well... i'm endin here... laterz...
