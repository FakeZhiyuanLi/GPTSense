      Buckle up, its time for rapid fire.  After a prolonged debate beween my sister and i against my dad. Gay people are in fact humans and should not have to hide the fact that they are gay. Free speach, and they arent animals or confused adolescents.  I love seeing my sister, she rocks. The best part: burning cds. We both burned like ten cds from each other and its FREE!   My family should not be allowed to see each other for over twenty minutes because when we do dad ends up yelling and someone starts crying.  I like having friends all over the country, and i like seeing them on holidays even more. This was my first thanksgiving with unrelated people and it was fun.  running a 5K before a big feast is an amazing idea that should be done all the time.  The decemberists are one of the coolest bands ever  I dont like how i didnt get to hang out with my favorite people this weekend.  I wish we had skied in CO  I love jackie  keep chasin that rainbow

      A VERY BAD DAY  hey, i swam for 5 hours today and lifted for one more! My shoulders are about to fall off! The only cure is to apply icyhot till i cant stand it and sit and cry!   Jackie wasn't at school today, i didnt realize how much of a better mood she puts me in. Its too bad shes sick, otherwise i might be able to stand it. She wrote me some sort of delirious e-mail talking about hacking up music,  you know all the romantic stuff youd expect. But thats why i love her, shes so straight forward. That and shes not afraid to joke about guy stuff.   school is now insignificant, it is merely a state i am in between practices. If you see me, please hug me and say "itl be allright." Partly because i need it, and partly because i want to see how many people are reading this.  One more day of school, hold on.  Keep chasin that rainbow

      Oh man, I honestly cant think of how this weekend could be better  So tonight started off a little on the negative side. My mom literally bulied me into going to this dinner thing at church, i was extra sure to mumble curses at her. So i went knowing that i would prolly miss the prudes set, which brings images of me crying into my head. It was allright, i got to see chris boyer again, its been like a century, at least. Hes changed but is still the same, on another crazy exercise routine, something about kettles? If i still believed in god i would have been happy to see him at church, as it is, i just like seeing old friends.   After the too long dinner thing, me and curt made like trees and ran like hell to the party at suzys. I MISSED THE PRUDES! grrrrr. I guess it turned out okay though, i got to learn how to dance from jackie (im a very awkward boy) and we streaked for a bit as well. My auto teacher who lives down the street was joking with me today about me running naked, so i rang his doorbell and mooned him. TAKE THAT!   I just plain loved tonight, and to the prudes: please play soon, i need you like a fish needs water. And to my new friends that i made tonight: Larua, chris, nathan, and grace i hope we meet again and have as great a time.  Keep chasin that rainbow

      this weekend is rocking my pea green socks off  so i was talking to mike today and he asked me what i was going to do for the prudes. So we went through about four bad ideas and then it was decided. I dressed like a golpher and putted on stage, it was pretty funny, at least to me. And diver carlos brokedanced! I love that kid and ive met him twice. Then me and jackie hung out at cookie dough with bill and matt and some others, i am now in love with brown sugar cookie dough shakes. Prudes: you rock, Minogue an I: i couldnt beleive how great you were tonight, Jackie i love you. That sums up the feelings for tonight.  keep chasin that rainbow

      What a crazy night  Lets see here. I met the swimming gang at 9 in front of derek wilsons house. So me derek, the leclairs, alberts and diver carlos set off to tp five girls with 175 rolls. all was going well until we started flickig people off that passed by. One dude started chasing us. So we were doing like forty down neighborhoods and i was hangin out the window throwing shit at the dude until we lost him after like ten minutes. NUTS! So we threw some shit at things, peed on some lawns. then we happened across these really drunk sophomores that pat and ryan seemed to know. everyone was trying to get them to flash us so i was like hey fuck it. Naked hugs were givin, but only one girl flashed us, all that work for nothing! So that was a night, i really think we could have died from that guy chasing us cause he was pissed.

      Everything is perfect, for serious.  I told jackie that i love her today. we were sitting around at her house and i was coloring (and doing a rather poor job) a little mermaid book. And i have been wanting to tell her that for a while now, so i just got really nervous. I had this whole little speech worked out, but i didnt have the guts to say it, i just finished my picture and wrote i love you on the top and she wrote it too. so im totally excited now. i never said the speech, cause im dumb.   So jackie, i know you read this. I love the way you allways smile, i love the way you make me smile too, i love how your hair allways gets in my mouth when i hold you, i love how you listen to great music, i love how you never lose your cool on the little stuff, i love your eyes that i can never tell what color they are, i love how you just laugh it off when im being dumb. I love you.  I really wish i could have said it.  Keep chasing that rainbow

      so mikey Swanberg has been telling me to listen to alkaline trio again. I wasnt going to but then i remembered. When mike tells me to do something i either do it and am very pleased with the results or i don't and wish i did. So i did, and i completely forgot how good radio is. Thanks mike.  Ive got another poster to do for a girl going to state. I don't think ill do a funny thing on it though cause last time it made kelley kryzmenski cry and her dad tracked us down and yelled at us. So ill play it straight.  Keep chasing that rainbow

      I am unbelievably surprised at how good i feel. I think im going to blame jackie for keeping me from the normal sadness. Oh well, cant say i miss it.  You all can wave goodbye to the jeepster for a while. I decided to put it into hibernation for the winter since december and cars with a sort top that doesnt fit in a lot of places dont mix at five o'clock in the morning. So i swaped my grandpa to put the jeep in his garage and drive my grandmas old car. The only bad part about that is now im thinking of my grandma again, and im feeling really guilty for not going to her grave for a long time. I mean, it hasnt even been a year and im allready forgetting about her. So this weekend im determined to stop by and see how things are, before the snow covers everything up. Ill prolly tell her about how ive been reading a lot lately, shed be real proud.  Thats enough of that, im getting a little misty. It kills me that i wasnt in town when she died.  this week is all downhill from here baby. Im super pumped for the weekend and the two, count em, two minogue an I shows! And the prudes and hayes are playing too so thats just a big bonus. I have a feeling whether i like it or not I'll be shelling out ten bucks for those tickets though and thats ruff, especailly when i gotta start saving for christmas gifts. I have trouble holding on to money, cause i just want to spend it on cds as soon as i get it. must....resist....make people......happy on christmas. Ah well, im off to get ready and go swimming, this way i dont have to shower tommorow morning ;).  Keep chasing that rainbow

      Ahh, there is nothing i like more than coming home after practice and finding no one home. peace at last!  My dads out of town again, hes been gone like five out of every seven days for the past month. But i really like it. It has a lot to do with me not liking my him to the extreme. We never talk except to argue or him to express nuggets of wisdom. Example: "I think Jackies a nice girl, but you know sometimes younger girls can be a little in awe and promiscuous. Don't do something i wouldn't do." Now lets pick this apart. First, he has seen jackie once for about ten seconds and didnt even say hi because he was on the phone. Second, there was no build up to this, he just said it while i was reading, so i said ok and ignored him. And finally, truth is i want to do EVERYTHING that he wouldn't do. I want to become as unlike him as possible, except something that would harm someone else, cause otherwise i might end up being some self absorbed business man who would rather play with my cousins and talk proudly about them than his own son. Any way, school was surprisingly painless and i walked jackie home so i could get a ride from her. The jeep being broke sucks left testicles. It would have been nice and romantic but this guy i know from way back tagged along and made things weird, mainly because he talks nonstop about drugs and sex. But hey, at least it was funny. Practice was perfect tonight, i feel comfortably worn and couldnt be happier. Now for the best part of the day, calling jackie.  Peace be with you

      fog has got to be one of the spookiest weather conditions. I was driving home, its dark, and i could swear i saw wolfman chasing me.  I feel like i cant decide how to act in my life. I act differently around so many people, i wonder what i really am like. But i feel like i just pick my favorite personality, even if i am only confident and smart around a few people. I think its because i let other people define me. like around church im thoughtful and quiet, allways that way around people, and when im with a stranger i allways act kinda dumb and modest, and when im with my friends i find myself trying to impress them way too much. I was talking to this kid the other day who was saying all these things like what he could tell about me, and i only see him one period a day. He was just saying how i am obviously this sexist, racist, drunk drag on the world. And the truth is i am that way in that class because i talk to this other guy who is that way. I think i lost the real me a long time ago, and thats a little sad. I don't know why but it kills me when i cant bring a smile to someones face at any given time, so i just shove myself into the mold that that person would like me to be in and start pleasing. i just wish that i could think for myself and not adapt myself to whatever people want me to be. I guess all i can do for now is just enjoy the times that i am the person i want to be.

      Today was pretty great in my book. It really has to do with me being around jackie, she just makes me feel happy cause she is awsome. It wasnt looking like it was going to be all that great though. My mom woke me up today at 8 30 by banging on my door and saying i had to go to church. I didnt really want to though, so i just mumbled something and got in the car, then i fell asleep for the entire service. TAKE THAT GOD!  i had jackie pick me up to go to the powder puff game today, but the other team forfeited. If there is one thing i hate its quitters and it bums me out when some people decide not to show up and ruin everyone elses fun. So i tried to make friends with the geese by giving them popcorn, but they would have none of it. At least chris laughed at it though. hung out with cait emily claire and jackie for a while. It was aight.  weekend days are allways weird cause there is soooo much time. I thought that id just tell you my day really quick but it took up a lot of room. And i still feel like ive been sitting on my couch all day doing nothing cause there is just so much time to fill. whatever, ill just keep doing stuff. Ill give thoughts later tonight cause im a little obsessed with this thing just now. later

      Hi, im new at this so please forgive me faceless person behind the computer. Im not going to lie to you, this is probably going to be lame for a while before i get a hang of it, but hey if you dont like it im not forcing you to read it. In case you didnt know my name is Don. I dont think it matters what I look like but i do have this nasty habit of ranting (ecpect a lot of that in the future).   I don't exactly know why im doing this other than the fact that i really like it when people mention me on their blogs so i think it would be nice to be the guy making other people feel better. right now thats all i have to say, but i promise i will update often and the fun stuff is coming.

      thank god mike is home, i forgot how great it is to talk to him.  Man, i just think its funny. Me and mike, in the same boat. Falling in love when we havent been there before and not having a clue what to do about it. I mean, we havent even had a real girlfriend before. Every days another adventure. But the real point im trying to get to here is this. I was informed that he and blair spend, on average, around five hours a day together, i wanted to punch him in the face. I get to see jackie like half that much, if at all. NOT FAIR. kinda lame, but all i want to do is kill time with her. too bad i never get the chance.   Which brings us to a lambka ramble. Todays topic being way too fucking busy to enjoy two weeks off completely. Never ever ever get yourself in a situation where just about everything has to be planned out to fit around a ridicullus schedual. Cause thats what ive been doing, and all you find yourself doing is thinking about the person you want to be with while your doing whatever it is we are doing. i think thats a problem with american society. We try to cram so much into our lives we wear ourselves out. I mean, look at the japanese, and i mean old school japanese before AMERICAN influence made them the tech geeks in over crowded cities they are today. I mean, they had it figured out, just relax, give in to the flow. I think one of these days i need to just take a deep breath don a kimono and rake some sand around rocks, prolly do me a wonder of good.  this is all just me dancing around the fact that i just want to see her more. This is also just me creeping myself out more and more as i write. hence the stopping now

      mmmmm, donuts  so last night was great. Krissys house was really cool cause it was like a coffee house, only i knew everyone there so it was better. I finally got to see stef again too i was excited for that. We decided that since pete and cait look so much alike that they dont really love each other so much as their reflection. Prolly more true than we think.  So after all was said and done some of us went to the river and yada yada yada got really cold and wet. It was fun, if everynight could be that exciting life would be amazing.   Only downside is later i said a bunch of dumb stuff to jackie online, which only makes it sound more dumb. I think shes ok with it but im a little upset with myself actually. Guess ill just have to make it up to her, somehow...  you all have fun, im going back to watching goldfinger. I never realized that the girl in that movie is named pussy galore. HA

      Everything is so right  i just can't explain what i feel now. Im just at ease, for the first time since i can remember. Something about running naked with mike and shouting i love jackie across a pond just make the world perfect. I am so deep in love i cant even see the surface, i dont want to see the surface.  I hope you can find that person that just makes every moment fascinating when they are there. I hope you can recognize it when it comes. And i hope you dont let it pass you by.  Ive caught the rainbow, the trick is to ride it and not fall off.

      This is the delayed, but should have happened yesterday blog about being happy and christmas  Wow, i got to sleep in on christmas morning. It was great, there was a little awkwardness though cause my sisters planned on running in my room and shaking me awake, only i was in the act of putting on boxers when they came bursting through the door. I laughed pretty hard about it, they got a little red, no one told mom and dad.   I got a couple of good books which is awsome cause i havent been reading lately. This one called "A heartbreaking work of staggering genius" is really good. Its kind of like the perks of being a wallflower with a grown up guy and its all true. Plus i got this book of poetry by Billy Collins, he is the man.  My sisters were awsome this year with gifts too. Carolyn gave me this awsome wilco shirt, and liz got me a barry white album seeing as he died this year and i dont have any soul in my collection. What was really funny was my grandma liked barry a whole lot and was groovin on the couch to it.  there, happiness makes everyone feel better

      i dont see stef nearly enough and i feel bad about it. I mean what kind of a fucking friend am i if i had no idea what was going on in her life. Jesus, how could i let this happen. How do you just drift away from one of your best friends and not even realize it? I dont even know what to say except i am very dissapointed in myself for abandoning her. How much trouble would it have been to call and ask whats up? I feel terrible about it. i am so sorry....

      I'm glad we celibrate a holiday that ceased to stand for anything a long time ago.  Lots of nice gifts. Books are awsome i'm so glad. But the main thing o the year is a cell phone. I didnt really ask for it, and im not sure how much i want it. But its not really costing anything, only ten bucks a month cause its sharing the bill with my moms phone. So i guess im just testing it for six months. My main problem is its getting to be a headache allready. I found this super sweet london is calling ring tone, but the phone cant open the package sent. A little frustrated.   I also thought it was funny how my list was twenty some cds that i wanted and maybe three other objects. I didnt get a single cd. I feel like my family just ignores me sometimes.  But i mean, it doesnt even matter and im still really pleased with christmas. I did get a lot of gift certificates and stuff so im just going to go crazy at best buy to make up for it all. as far as the phone goes, the number is 209-5549 so whenever you want to do something fun call me.   Mike gets home tommorow, very exciting. I miss his womanly hips

      my thoughts are brighter than all these christmas lights  i cant even say how right it all is. How i couldnt have dreamed up a world this great.   Christmas is coming, i got my shopping done today. I'm saying this in advance: some friends got gifts, others didnt. The system i decided on besides favorites was if i saw something that reminded me of you or i could see you really enjoying, i got it for you. Dont feel left out though, christmas hugs will definatly take place.  Im going to sleep now, eventually. No troubles = great sleep.

      it just hits you sometimes.  So i rode the bus home after this swim meet. I had a bit of an eye opening conversation. I was a very fat kid when i was little. To give you an idea ive grown about a foot and weigh five pounds less now than how i was in eighth grade (and it wasnt muscle weight). So someone brought up how funny it was that i have changed so much. So then there were some kids on the bus reminicing about how different I am. All of them said they used to rip on me behind my back and promised theyd never hang out with "that loser". Kids are such bastards sometimes.   I wanted to ask if theyd still talk to me now if i didnt spend two years of my life whipping my ass into shape. But im not sure id be pleased with the answer.  Alls well that ends well right?

      ive got happy songs in my head and no school to dread  so today was dress up day. going to lunch fifth period i saw jackie. And i know this is really shallow but damn. Hot HOt HOT. My jaw just dropped and i stuttered a couple of times. I ended up hugging her and she took the dropped jaw as i wanted a kiss. So i didnt look like a total fool. But i mean, what the hell am i doing with someone that beutiful? Thank my lucky stars.  turned in early tonight cause i wasnt really feeling it at bruzaks. I dont know, maybe there were one too many annoying girls, i wont mention names cause i dont know em. hopefully they dont read this, if they do heres my two cents. Nobody wants you to be a fake slut all the time, or ever. Just fuckin calm down and stop pretending to be something your not and dont want to be either. Plus, i hate it when smart people act dumb and try to hide their real smart self. if you dont care thats one thing, but dont try to fool me, i can tell cause your too perfect at being dumb.   i think ill stop now

      this is a joined effort between me and the faggot sitting next to me named owen.  Owen decided not to dress up today. LAME. I mean, even though the principle made us do it and took the fun out of it, its still not cool to do that shit. what do you have to say owen?  "blow me"  hes cute like that. Any way, we be rockin the watching of christmas vacation in keyboarding. Hes actually a fairly cool kid except that hes a freshman. Keyboardings a lot of fun for me. Its the easiest A ive have ever gotten, owen on the other hand aint very fast at typing. What grade are you getting owen?   "C+, it actually may be higher, that was last time i checked"  well that aint as bad as i thought, must be performing sexual favors for the teacher. So im going to sign out now, this was almost fun. ill have to type with a co-author more often. Say good bye faggot.  "Bye"  (he is an actual person by the way)  keep chasin that rainbow

      i dont even know how i feel tonight  im trying to ignore my mom and dad bashing my sisters old boyfriend, good thing shes not here. I hate it when people talk about each other behind their backs. I feel really bad when i do it to people too and that happens more than it should. I always feel really bad, i think i just get caught up in being the center of attention. But i havent done it in a while so im proud of myself. Good, they stopped, i can move on.  i dont have any homework tonight which is really nice. just hold on for one more day! You can do it!  au revoir

      love is like jazz: you make it up as you go along, you flaunt your mistakes, and never really know how the song goes.  Oh man what a night. Jak came to the meet so i was super pumped. I got my best time in like a year and a half in the backstroke cause i was trying to impress her. Wow im a nerd. Then i saved some kid having an asthma attack by getting him to the side of the pool so he could get actual help.   Im on top of the world! And i so saw jackie once allready this week!!  keep chasin that rainbow  P.S. Sarah Basset, im a jerk sometimes, im really sorry, for the record chris never made that up it was someone else and i just ran with it. I dont really know you but that was way way out of line and feel free to spread a terrible rumor about me that makes me sad cause i deserve it.

      I am so out of touch  so i was sitting in math today, and it hit me. I'm not even feeling human emotions anymore, im just kind of there... If you ever read fight club you would know the line "everything is a picture of a picture of a picture [...] it's not even happening to you" thats really how i feel. I mean i just sit in classes and let it wash over me, some i understand, most i just let go, and i honestly dont know where the time goes, i just dont remember most of my life between monday and friday. Its not even a bad thing, or is it, i just find it weird. I kind of miss taking part in my life, i mean i do that over weekends and detaching is the only way to not die in the season, but i still miss it. oh well.   Meet against north in two periods. Jak will be there, so i hope i swim fast and impress her. The hard part is shes going with kristen dicciani who is dating one of the fastest kids on our team, in state for that matter, so i cant help but look sub par. Haha, thats pretty elementary school "LOOK AT ME" mentality, but im pretty sure my mind never left the sixth grade.  By the way Vasich, i hope you win, its hilarious how you look at it like a video game.

      good won out today, but only because there was a significant amount.  so i had a fun day, smooth sailing and all. Me and Emily Custardo got into this crazy fight that involved us acting like ten year old brother and sister and throwing stuff at each other. I had fun, and the entire lunch table was completely silent watching us, except krissy who was getting mad. sorry krissy.  today after practice i got my picture taken for the yearbook. It was really funny cause Blair is doing this page on practicing on late arrival mornings and interviewed me. So she came by tonight with mike by her side (it was cute) and took a pic of me in my speedo and backpack opening a door looking tired. It'l be the best ever if that pic takes up an entire page and the whole school sees me practically naked in front of them. ROCK ON.  jak starts work at colonial, i dont want that to happen. It's not like i dont see her enough, now i gotta go through her work schedual too. oh, well. me and grace are plotting how to get her to quit.  toodles

      my head is so fucked up i cant stand myself right now.  so my coach got really mad at our team about this weekend. he sat us down and said people were letting us down and not giving it everything they have. so i go up after practice and say something like this.  Dont think for one second that i am not always giving one hundrud percent when i race, you knew that all last year, i dont know why you dont now. The one exception, in my three years here would be on saterday, i was on a relay and there was no way i could bring us back from last place, we were a lap and a half behind, impossible. so i didnt kill myself, but i also got the same time i have been getting this year. PLUS the time im getting now is the same as the end of last year, so im sittin pretty well i think.  his response,  Don, you dont practice enough outside of the season. I want you going five seconds faster because that what you went at the end of last year, (this was in a fast suit, completely shaved, and tapered). You need to be practicing twice a day over the summer and busting your hump and you can place in state, not just get in.  i say.  mike, summer is for fun, im not going to leave my friends and job like the three guys on the team who do that did these last two years, im sorry.  his response,  Don, your friends are not of your caliber, dont listen to them when they say to stay out, you need to practice more, get home early, wake up early...  WHAT THE FUCK! Im sorry, i will not leave my friends to pursue a hopeful spot in state, fuck that. This is fucking high school! We are supposed to be having the time of our lives, and im supposed to put that on hold so i can practice? No fucking way.  somebody, anybody, i need to know im not out of line here. I need you to tell me what you think i should do, because my backs to the wall and ive got a lot of pressure, i need to know what the "right" way is.  help me sort this mess out

What's even better is she totaly gave me a great gift for her so i can stop stressing on that.   I love my liz, and shes coming home in like a week!!!! YAY!!! im going to go back to homework now, but its great to hear from her again.  keep chasin that rainbow

      what madness  so no jackie but i managed to keep myself out of trouble for the most part.  Joe Swanbergs in town, cool kid. His friend was with him, Ryan Berg, who was apparently really close friends with my sister liz back in the day. He is a really cool kid. i liked talking to him.  so i went to this cofee house to meet the prudes, followed them from the church to an actual coffee house for a show, drove chris hayes back in the middle of it, missed the rest of the show, went back to the church, got another show, i liked it. i don't reccommend listening to sad music when your missing someone though.  So hayes has started lying to his parents to go do things at night, i know how that goes. I also know how that ends, with him being cuaght, his parents suspecting him, and a break down of any communication whatsoever inside the family. In any order you pick. The thing is that when it happened to me a substance abuse period happened, i guess i just want chris to have someone to make sure he doesnt get too deep in some substance if he does go that route. Bill prolly saved me back then.   Im going to go now, im sleeping at my grandmas tonight cause my parents are gone. If i dont see jak tommorow there is going to be hell to pay, i dont know how, but it will happen.  and now im feeling dangerous.

A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT I mean i just get so incredibly happy and awsome and I feel like the person i want to be all the time when im around her. It's not fair that i cant do that at least once during the week. grrrr. Thats the hard thing about love, you want to be with them more and more, then something gets in the way, and you get surprisingly depressed.   I dont know, but for me the definition of love is when shes the person you find yourself thinking about when you arent doing anything or everything. I just find myself wandering off and then shes there in my head, and its nice no perfect.  Ahh, one more day then i get my fix, im counting the seconds.  keep chasin that rainbow

      I GET TO WAKE UP AT NORMAL PEOPLE TIME TOMMOROW!  so yesterday i was thanked for writing a blog for chris and bill. It felt good to be thanked, so today i shall write for matt even though i dont know if he reads this. But, i think he would get a kick out of this.  Does anyone realize how ironic that harrassment survey was? I mean, the majority of kids just turned it into a joke, myself included. So we were insulting the survey people. According to the definition of harassment on the survey we harrassed the people trying to put a stop to harrassment. That makes me laugh, hard.  I like talking to matt a lot. That kid is so origional and smart and opinionated it makes my head spin. I just kinda sit back and soak up his wisdom, then crack a dumb joke and he manages to humor me most of the time.  ummmmmm, bye

      if only you knew how much that smile means  tommorows late arrival, lucky bastards. I'll be waking up at 5 30 dont you worry. Getting fit is a bitch  a big part of me wants to make snow angels right now. A big part of me wants to talk to an angel right now: just to see what its like being a messenger who cant talk back. Thats something to think about, if there is a god, how do his angels feel about saving our sorry asses all the time, and getting no thanks from us? I know id be a little pissed, i dont know, i guess heaven just seems warped to me. Like how am i supposed to be in paradise when someone else is, i mean, everyone likes different things. Say a guy really likes doing drugs, i dont think thats a sin, does he have an endless supply of heroin in heavin. Do i have to deal with his drugged up ass while im there? Id rather not, not that i have a problem with that, its just i dont like it when people are so distant...  il stop beating up on christianity now.   i really like hearing from people who read this thing, namely hayes and billy V. I mean it makes me happy just to write some of this down, but better when i know it makes other people laugh. So bill and chris, this is all for you, with love.  im feeling a little weird just now, i cant be responsible for what i say anymore, i think ill see how rockies doing now.  cheers

      the world is slightly left today  so i went to the zoo with my parents and my newly married grandpa to see the christmas lights. it was pretty cool. I dont know, it was all dumb cause of my dad though. i didnt talk to him at all and just hung out with my grandpa cause we are tight. Then he walks up and starts explaining what the patches on my jacket mean. i was like "its easy to be modest when someone else brags for you" he didnt get it and kept talking.  I am so missing jack. seeing her once a week outside of school is killing me. i dont know how im going to find time though. damn.   Im just trying so hard not to be the jealous boyfriend trying so hard to not make her change trying so hard not to get in the way i mean, i just want to be there   eh, im going now

I was in no mood for this cause i was beat. so just yelled at them for their nakedness. hope i didnt hurt his feelings or whatever, but im kind of beyond feelings right now.  bye

      I'm sure some hookers lead nice lives....  dont go see "Monster" if you are in a bad mood, youll kill yourself  I really have no clue how i got this lucky. Life is too great to imagine, i dont have real problems. I feel like exploding from the inside because im loving my life so much right now. And i know its not perfect but its almost and thats more than i could hope for.  Its like how im taking this english class and weve been talking about the archetypal garden. The garden is a place of pure happiness and no evil. I am in my real life garden whenever im around this girl. Things just melt away and its just right. I just want to scream its so great. I dont think life was supposed to feel this good, its ridicullus. And the funny part is, i didnt even see her for more than twenty minutes today and im still at this point

      look into my eyes and tell me if what im missing is still in me  I wonder what would happen if i were to answer the question "are you allright" completely. I dont know if im more messed up inside than most or if everyone just plays it off. I thought a lot about that question today, and i really think i should not worry about these things so much. but then thats who i am. Just kindof melancholy for most of today due to the funeral i guess.  Luckily i had a fun night with jackie and i love her so  Results are in: Im feeling guilty about being so happy at a time like this

      The best compliment a boy can get: Homoerotic  i want to talk about the wake but i dont. Its the first time i have seen a not-alive person and it messed me up bad. I talked really nervous to matt dan and krissy and my leg was shaking the entire time. Once i got out i was really weird in my head. And thinking about what will happen when i die. So i got jackie to talk at me so i could forget. Really lucky that she humored me. I was really close to crying and i didnt even know him well.   All I can say is that stef is my hero. Talk about being strong.

      death to the 500  this semester is going to be hard. But im determined not to scrape by again and actually do homework. And since im going to take a varsity study hall for gym i should be able to succeed in that....as long as i dont sneak out too often to see jak at lunch.   french trip meeting tonight that my mom went to since i was swimming. Should be fun. But theres no way im going to come out the other side without unintentionally offending a lot of french people. oh well

      Like the kid behind the counter, remembering your face...  Dan Li and i were talking tonight at practice and he told me that it would be fun if i joined cross country next year and worked out post-practice with him too. It sounds like a really good idea and im thinking it would be fun to break from swimming. But thats a long way off so im not going to worry about it.  I finally remembered to bring back my notebook o poetry, now the copying to a neater form begins. it'l prolly take a while, but i think itl be sweet to have an official colletction of poems in a book. I decided to stop putting stuff in once i met jackie because that really started a new chapter in my life and would be another book. But that ones a long ways off seeing as my writing is much less because of school, swimming, and writers block. Anyway, the task at hand is "umbra" and i was re-reading the stuff and its pretty damn bitter, i was surprised. Looks like the title was right on.  Fairwell

      Obvious  Stef's dad died yesterday. I can't explain how bad i feel. And i was standing in her kitchen saying nothing and wondering what to do. And i caught myself thinking poetically. I stopped that right away. I refuse to cheapen all that with a poem. to me, there is no way the same thing can be used for writing about stars and grass and trees and love and bitterness, and death.

      All you gotta have is a little faith in yourself  Poker tonight. And i tottaly came out ten bucks ahead! BOO YAH! I found myself down to 50 cents and rallied myself back to $18.50 and i came in with nine. I rock, and everyone said id lose again.  Saw jackie again today, its looking like i might pull off a full weekend of seeing her which would be so great im trying not to get my hopes up. I read her blog and she was talking about the dance. I'm really excited, but see, im a very awkward boy and dancing isnt exactly my strong suit. I try hard to dance well, and maybe thats the problem. But im kindof up against the likes of swanberg in the past taking her to a dance and theres no way im even near his league. Then again, shes a good enough dancer for the both of us.... ill just follow her lead.... if i can....nervous.....but excited.  I've still got adrenaline going from winning poker three hours ago. Prolly never go to sleep.

      in the words of winnie the pooh: "A very good day"  Finals are over, no difference. I really didnt mind finals because had two finals to worry about, math (need 73) bio (need 68). Pretty sure i got those, everything else was blow off and i nailed. It was really weird not stressing out at all. I could get used to that.  Post-school i showed pete up in a burrito eating contest. But he did give me a scare halfway through, so i had to really speed up. And while i am proud of my winning, it was a very unfulfilling meal seeing as i didnt take time to enjoy it. Never again. Thats why next time we are having a competition over amount of burritos eaten in one sitting.  Then a nap with jackie. Perfect.  Swim meet. Went very well, ive been rocking lately and i hope i can keep it up. During my backstroke jak pulled a sneaky manuever and switched my towels with this nifty green one. And written on it was something along the lines of this will have to hold me till she can at winter. Im REALLY happy/excited about that!   Unfortunatly i couldnt cap the day off with her, but thats only a small downside. And the prudes and minogue and i show was good and made up for it.  Now for contented sleep.

      beserk  i got home today very very very early: 5 00. It was really weird to see the sun after leaving central. Right after i got home me and my mom left to get dinner at TGI Fridays. And i decided i dont really have a problem with my mom outside of her being nosy. I mean all moms are but not all kids can have a nice conversation with them for an entire evening. Just stay away from polotics, drugs, and homosexuality and we have a fun time. Im actually very happy to know i can talk to someone in the house.  On our way out we saw mike and blair. Pretty darn cute. Nuff said  But here's my problem. I got home so early and have nothing to do. So i said to myself, "self, you used to like to watch tv, why dont you give that a shot and be comatose on the couch for a while." But it sucked. All tv outside of sports, and maybe five or six comedy shows are terrible. I think ive done without it for so long i now realize how dumb it is. And i honestly don't understand how all these people get wrapped up in these night time shows because they are just dull and unimaginative.   So i read.

      Eureka  I figured out this morning why my writings flowing again. I have recognized the fact that i am not sad or angry, but i knew that all along. What i did not know is that its impossible (for me) to write about BEING with her, only about how i feel after i see her. Im pretty sure this is because i dont think poetically when im with her. I dont really think at all, i just kind of be and its the greatest thing ever. So really all i can write about being there is the lame "your so beutiful" creep stuff, and there is so much more to love than that. Don't get me wrong, im pretty convinced shes the most beautiful girl i know, but thats not even close to her strong point. It has to do with auruas, and i cant explain it further because that would be writing about it and i cant figure out how to do that. So im sticking with what i can describe and thats when im not in this daze around her.  so there. I said it.

      Maybe ill shower next time....  Finally saw jackie tonight. That rocks. but the problem i had was im a little smelly right now. or a lot a smelly if your not me and not used to smelly dons. so she was a little annoyed with that i think but hey, thats me in a nutshell. Unkempt.  Finals are coming and im not paying nearly enought attention to them, but i dont really have to either. I just go to my room and read my book when im told to go study. TAKE THAT MOM AND DAD!  Im going to go put on deoderant and maybe sleep.

      Theres an image on every wall: a face alive  with small teeth  Only seen from the corner of my hoping eyes  Dash from room to room will this picture  animate?  Can i speak and interact? Can i joke and get a laugh?  My mind  the joker teasing me with ideas of you  Im running  around like a mad man muttering comments out of a gasping chest  Maybe i should stop and try to forget you But id rather go insane than have you off my mind   I talked to bill last night and he aked me to make a book of my poems. I think its a great idea so im going to start working on it once i get my notebook back from central. Ive allready got all the stuff written so it just needs orginization. The titles going to be "umbra". This way i also get to go back and "perfect" it too so im excited for that. If you would like a book i guess just tell me, its going to be copied hand written pages stapled together so dont expect anything professional. Oh, and just a heads up, its going to be very very bitter so be warned.

      and it was hard, like coming off the pill that you take to be happy.  Rocked the swim meet. At best times or same really good times for all events which is good. But now my legs dont work. Sacrifices.  Jackie is very very sick which is no good. Stomach flu is bad news and now she cant do anything with anyone even though she meant to re establish old bonds.   Life is sergery, bite the bullet. Or you can sedate yourself.  So im off to gamble again tonight. We're gonna be smart though and lose it all in four hours instead of three though. I hope  accomplishment

      now if i was a good gambler...  So i lost 20 bucks in poker to scummy swimmers. But i had a pretty ok time doing it. And i definatly wasnt the first one out so ill take what i can get.  I hear that jackies sick. I havent actually heard this from her because shes sick and resting most of the time and im swimming most of the time. But its cool that we communicate through other people...sorta. Im just sympathetic for her i guess cause she hates being sick and this is the second time in three months she has been really sick.   Things will get better im sure. i just need to wait out this season and then i can actually put significant amounts of time into my life  au revoir

      Ho Hum  Ive been writing again lately. I think that essay just cleared up some major writers block which is nice. But then again i could just be thinking what im writing is good and all of you are to polite to disagree. Either way i laughed when Mike informed me that in the past some of my stuff was just too bitter for him. Thank god for honest people, i try to be honest with him without sounding like too much of a bastard cause i do like seeing his stuff.   Whithout further delay:  Your center is your forehead pulling you forward dragging extremeties  Any where it wants  Nowhere it has to  Makes sense After taking a step Back from the mosaic That makes up you  Closer to thoughts crossing through each other  Tricky to balance All these things Life can't be recorded to relive time lost  In the big picture No complaints Can be noticed when They're surrounded by joy

      so heres my hopefully funny essay, hope you enjoy                                                             CONFIDENTIAL “How I don’t know what to do/ With my hands when I talk to you/ And you don’t know where to look/ So you look at my hands.” The Weakerthans.	  	And then they were there. And they were pretty. Right around sixth grade it hits you: Girls = fascinating. But the average male has absolutely no idea how to deal with this strange and illogical being. So begins the process of trial and error that lasts a lifetime to figure out the one burning question in every heterosexual male’s mind. How do I get her to go out with me? 	In the beginning, you only have one chance: that there is some pretty girl who lives by your house and enjoys playing tag in fields. A search begins in the 10 year olds’ mind. Who fits these strict criteria. Some get lucky and find their first girlfriend, most sit back and pray for the opportunity to make out with little Ann in the bleachers after school. Now, the girl friend living close is a necessity in the dark ages of sixth grade due to the immobility of the sixth grade male. More than two to three blocks away is much too far to walk or ride your bike in public (this is because the other males are jealous and express this by calling you a girly boy and chanting “Bill and Suzy sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-I-N-G…). Methods of attraction vary, however most include hitting and making fun of the girl to get noticed followed by displays of physical skills. The alternative to this is known as cable. This is a very rare possession and often cherished by the young girl. If all goes well, Voila! A girlfriend!  The goal is also very unique in this stage of the boys development. The boyfriend doesn’t really know what to do with this girlfriend. Kissing is ok, but conversation is not a high priority to young boys. Thus, relationships last a month, give or take two weeks. It would be nice to say that relationships get more complicated in the males mind as it grows. However, it all boils down to not knowing what to do besides kiss the girl and desperately trying to hold a conversation. 	Time moves on and not much changes from the hidden affair between a boy and his girlfriend. Enter Highschool. Suddenly the male has to become a complex sensitive person who practices something called good hygiene to attract members of the fair sex (which by now is something to be commended for, not insulted). So the male begins to visit a strange, ugly, concrete structure called a mall. Inside are fashionable cloths, strange smelly liquids called cologne, and many floors. These malls are not all bad though because they have lots of good food, so the male shops for the latest girl-impressing fashion with many pretzel/soda/pizza breaks in between. It is also a very exciting time due to the ability to drive, which puts no distance requirements on the object of the boys affection as long as its reasonable. 	The highschool male also must develop an interesting personality. Often the television or more specifically MTV closely guides this quality. These boys will listen to many different rap artists and put on an air of being too cool for school. Oddly a large portion of the female population in the school are attracted to this, which only fuels more MTV inspired personas. There are many other kinds of personalities developed in highschool of course, and most are more original than that mentioned above. One of particular note is that of the rogue (mostly because the author includes himself with these devilishly charming people). The rogue is an entirely different breed. He will be as ridiculous as possible whenever possible. The idea is that the girl will notice how charming and fun he is and want to be around him more often. So the rogue employs many means to attract this attention. He will wear extremely tight girl pants to get his moderately attractive at best physique noticed (all the while getting laughter and sparking conversation). The rogue will also shout things out in a classroom setting to impress the female population with his bold wit. The rogue often crosses social barriers to loosen up any females present. He will hug another boy. This is seemingly gay until the true motives are realized, by hugging his friend the rogue now has an excuse to hug any girl he pleases. He is not being creepy, merely friendly and in a hugging mood. He is also known to engage in the act of streaking. The purpose of this: to show a lack of inhibitions and a willingness to try anything that the girl wants to do. The male goes to many different extremes in order to develop a personality capable of attracting a girl. 	Suppose the fashion and personality of this boy have succeeded and he now is going out with the girl he always (or at least most recently) wanted. The same problems of kissing and conversation come into play even seven years later than they originally cropped up. A few males do escape from this relationship pitfall and move in one of two directions. Some males then begin to use the girl as an outlet for sexual energy. This is generally frowned upon by older members of our society, but greatly admired by others with similar ambitions. It should be noted that this form of dating never lasts and never means anything to either person in the relationship. The other, more edifying way is that of falling in love. Very few highschool males are lucky enough to experience this euphoria. A state of never feeling bad is introduced to his mind and suddenly the Holy Grail of dating, conversation, comes easily between himself and his girlfriend. Love is in fact the real goal of all dating, it just takes the male a while to find the right girl to help him realize this. 	The author would love to continue this chronology of the male and his actions toward the opposite sex. But unfortunately he has not experienced that and cannot comment with any accuracy on this process. Undoubtedly it is much harder and serious and involves marriage. But for now all he can do follow his roguish ways and continue to love the girl he loves. And someday adapt to the new breed of female in college.

      Conflict  So me and chris got in this awsome fight. That actually sums up just about any conversation we have but this one was especially long and fun. All i can say is that i clearly won and am better looking due to not being covered in dark hair.   Talked to jak on phone for first time in weeks. I like seeing her and interacting more but ill settle for good conversation. Turns out we're in an abusive relationship seeing as tickling is considered abuse. Whoops! But if we are both fine with it i dont see a problem. Interesting to think about eh? Apparently no fun is allowed in the relationship for it to be healthy. Screw that.  keep chasin that rainbow

      i miss the innocence ive known  just me and the dad at home tonight. MMMMM, thats some good uncomfortable silence to go with dinner. I really wish i liked him more, then i wouldnt try to be out of the house as often as possible. But hey, if we aint talkin, we aint fightin, so thats good.  I went to church yesterday night and it got me thinking about god again. I think what i decided on was i started to lose faith in him/her/it when i began to keep my eyes open when i prayed. I mean go into any situation, the people praying with their eyes closed are mos def the most devout. Everyone else is looking around to make sure they fit in. And maybe thats the problem, its become so much of an image thing. I mean people think your a better person if you show up at church and follow through the motions. Ive honestly met some of the worst people ive come into contact with in my church, go figure. Which leads us to another question. Would those kids be so bad if their parents werent trying to shove them into a mold that the kid rejects? They prolly wouldnt be so bitter thats for sure. But then you have to remember that if the choice were left to the kid maybe a quarter of those who show up now would actually keep coming. And then the church would fail in its mission that has caused so much grief in peoples life. Well, i dont know where we would be without the catholic church condemming just about any new idea. Actually i do, we'd be a heck of a lot less fearfull.   Allways feels good to bash orginized religeon now and again. Dont get me wrong, if you do really believe i respect that, especially if you dont flaunt it for everyone to admire. Its just not for me.

      one lazy sunday later:   The boy at the far end of the train car kept looking behind him as if he were afraid or expecting someone  and then she appeared in the glass door of the forward car and he rose and opened the door and let her in  and she entered the car carrying a large black case in the unmistakable shape of a cello  she looked like an angel with a high forehead and somber eyes and her hair was tied up behind her neck with a black bow  and because of all that, he seemed a little awkward  in his happiness to see her,  whereas she was simply there, perfectly existing as a creature with a soft face who played the cello.  and the reason I am writing this on the back of a manilla envelope now that they have left the train together  is to tell you that when she turned to lift the large, delicate cello onto the overhead rack,  i saw him looking up at her and what she was doing the way the eyes of saints are painted  when they are looking up at God when he is doing something remarkable, something that identifies him as God.  Some people just know how to say it. Billy Collins is definatly one of them

      old friend good time  So i went to colonial with me old buddy chris. Half to talk of old times, half to use him to go to colonial. It was a good time, we spoke of things. He has a lot going on in his life and that determination is something i really respect. And talk about motivated. While we were there we found that bill meg and senior julia were there as well and that megs twin sister was our waitress. It was just a party from there on out. i think everyone had a fun time talking and i felt pretty entertaining so it was all good.  After things broke apart and people left for their homes (julias being a russian home) i bulied jackie into coming over and falling asleep for a while. It was nice even if she did smell bad.   gnight

      so i've got a problem here. Its awsome that everyone has a girlfriend or boyfriend, I really mean it. But do you all have to do something with them at the same time? Come on now, some of us (me) can't see our girlfriend tonight and would rather not watch pirates of the carribean with their parents.  But, you all are having an awsome time not having much else to do except be with each other so enjoy. I wouldnt want to get in the way anyways.  See you tommorow or the next

      Everythings going my way  Last night was great. An old fashioned steriotypical date with jackie. Normally Id be against all those cliches, but it was actually a really fun time. And i realized i honestly cant get enough of jackie. All of dinner was just me listening to her talking, and anything she says is fascinating and i cant get enough of her enthusiasm.   Plus, big fish is now in my top ten movies of all time. Maybe top five. It was really funny when we got to the theater too. Jackie is on a running across long distances squeeling hugging basis with at least a million girls. And about thirty of them were there last night, pretty darn hilarious. Then i just stood there grinning awkwardly cause i didnt know that girl, and i usually knew of the guy that girl was with, but they werent much in the way of talking. Guys are dumb, id know, im one of the dumbest.  Today was big news though. I tottally rocked my 200 freestyle race. I dropped four seconds and actually met my coaches expectations, dont ask me how. So it really is looking like ill make it to sectionals, and state isnt very far away from where i am now.  I hope you feel this good.

      So im officially a hard ass  Tonight i bench pressed twenty pounds more than i weigh, busting out the rep with 205 pounds. Boo Yah, i feel tough.  Now for whats really on my mind. I noticed something really awsome today, the way she walks. No one else walks like that, and its almost clumsy looking at first. But then i thought about it. She just kind of leads with her head, and her feat just barely keep up, almost like a permanent stumble, except theres a lot of bounce and energy to it. It totaly defines how great she is. She doesnt wait up for anything, just fucking goes. She puts her whole self into things and her physical body can barely keep up. Its actually the most graceful walk i can think of. I mean, its completely origional and honest, shes not trying to blend in she is just herself and doesnt need anyone to tell her what to do. God i love her  And i realized, about two minutes ago whats been nagging me at the back of my mind for the last couple of days. I havent gotten to really do many fun things with her lately. Sure hanging out is cool, but im a very active person and it kills me that i cant run around and do something exciting with her due to my sucky schedual. New Years was fun untill it blew up in my face, so im making plans to livin things up. So the plan involves an actual dinner and movie date someday soon, and i have begun to play games. The game im playing right now (she doesnt know) is called hit or miss. It involves quick pec kisses on the lips, only its hard to actually get the lips. So far ive gotten nose 2, lips 2 chin 1, and cheek 1. The goal is to make it to 50% success rate. I realize that doesnt count as doing something, but im having fun.  But for serious i feel boring and dumb lately, two things i know im not. i need to cut it out.

      lets hear it for wanting sleep  So today I was talking to bill and jak walked over. I didnt think anything of it since thats the usual and i was in the middle of saying something so i didnt have a chance to say hi. I didnt know anything was wrong until bill starts making really distressed jerks of his head and frowns deeply at me. I look down and i see just about the sadest jackie imaginable, really bent out of shape. Turns out she got a saterday. Ouch. So i feel really bad she feels bad. Does that make sense? And i couldnt get her to laugh either which i know is a bad sign cause she laughs at pretty much everything.  But she seems ok now. And its not like saterday detentions are all that bad, you just sleep through them, id know.   If you havent read chris's blog you need to (deanhayes.blogspot.com). After you read it you can join me and mike in slapping him around for being a dumbass about girls. I mean who the hell just gives up without ever making a real effort in the first place? Its tottaly his decision and all, but come on man, grow a pair. But he did use my tittle to describe his feelings, so that makes me feel inspirational and therefore warm inside. I guess i wont hit him as hard as i was origionally going to. And in the spirit of hitting dumb people, Austin cant figure out blogger and joined the dark side. aka ujournal. So im going to have to take care of his cute knife weilding morman ass.  god im so in love i don't even pay attention in my classes anymore. I need to not have jackie on the brain all the time, its bad for grades.  keep chasing that rainbow.

      but i dont love you for that  today was nice, i got to spend time doing nothing with jackie. It's actually pretty funny cause we have pretty much never done that before. That might be a good thing though, other wise you couldnt pry me away from her. That and her dog might die of hypothermia from being forgotten outside, whoops.  So so so close to the end of the season, i knew i promised to leave swimming out of the blog... but i only have 58 more practices left! thats like nothing. For serious, im not being sarcastic. Its all downhill from here. Thats a very positive thought.  i realized i never made any new years resolutions. Here it is: dont do something stupid and mess up all the awsome stuff going on in my life right now (aka friends, jackie, and being generally carefree). That settles it. Its nice to be in a world where im genuinly happy with what im doing for the first time.  Good luck in the end of the semester. God knows ill need it.

      mike was told not to write anymore love posts. Now the rest of us wont look so bad!  Tonight i boldly went where no don has ever been this break: Nowhere. I stayed in and bored the pants off myself. (no seriously i was walking around with no pants). I did get to spend a lot of time with my best friend though, my dog rocky. Lots of walks and games of fetch. We havent spent a lot of time together so it was good to catch up. Conversations are a little one sided though. But i like having a good listener.   tommorows not a day so much as a change in state of mind. Homework is such a nasty word. Hope i dont go crazy in the switch over. But school also means i dont get to see jak nearly every day. Sure i see her at school, but thats just two minute conversations about nothing they dont count. Hope that doesnt drive me to crazy either. I predict a lot of blogging on missing her in the future. Feel free to slap me back into shape if that happens.  So i blow you a kiss goodnight.

      its been a while since ive had time to think.  Notice this. Your fun is almost never self created. Examples: a) go to an amusmant park, have a great time. But guess who is in a shit job paying close to minimum wage? The janitors, the operators, the people selling you overpriced cotton candy. b) go out to dinner, have a great time laughing talking whatever. But who doesnt want to be there? The bus boys and waitresses who have friends going out that night, but they have to work this dead end job. c) you play a sport you love like soccer. You have a great time playing, but guess who sacrificed their life to teach you this? the coach, whats more people are making their living off maintaining those fields.  Heres my point. You or me having fun almost allways depends on other people not having fun. And thats fine, nothing to worry about there. What isnt ok is if you dont give back. It's not fair. You have people sacrificing for you, you need to give back. Maybe even just letting them know you appreciate it would help. I dont know.   But I'm living in this completely odd enviorment where i just leech off other people working their asses off. I dont think thats fair. So what im saying is that I need to not bitch this summer about working, and i need to not get on other people about their jobs, and people shouldnt be too displeased with their jobs. Because its your turn to give someone else a fun time, they would and do do the same for you. Sure they bitch just as much, but who likes someone who complains all the time?  I need to along with a lot of other people just calm down about responsibilities and realize they are helping other people. That cools me down i know.   Im staying in tonight cause an oppurtunity to go out never really occured. Dont be surprised to see more posting later on

      so im a jock...  Pete called me a jock last night. Im not sure how to deal with that information cause thats kinda what i try not to be. i mean i think im a little too smart and a little too sober and a little too much of a virgin for that. But he didnt mean it badly so im in the process of laughing it off.  I lied to you last post. New years was a little unsettling due to a very out of control jackie (more than usual). and i was very worried that I wasnt what she really wanted after all. Turns out i couldnt be more wrong, but that conversation took a lot of working up to for me to actually do it. I think she could tell how nervous i was cause i didnt want to look her in the eye since that would make me even more nervous so i just drove around neighborhoods for the whole thing. But all is well, better than well. I think now we both know this isnt just a game ones playing on the other: its genuine. Thats a very good thing.  keep chasin that rainbow

      Happy new year to every last one of you  That was a fun night eh? I had fun running around being stupid. Really stupid come to think of it. And i still remember it! Bonus points for that. Jackie was honestly the funniest thing ever, haha.  So heres what im thinking. If you guys could go ahead and form a mob at say the intersection of bailey and fender, then light some torches, go to my place, and lynch my parents. That would be really nice. I'm a little upset that i couldnt stay the night, that was the one thing that i really wanted to do last night and they shut me down. So the sooner you get on that the sooner i get to have unhindered fun. Damn i am pissed.  I feel like talking, i dont know why. Feel free to stop reading at any time because there is no point to any of this.  My brain is messed up. I officially can't sleep more than eight hours at a time. I woke up at nine today and spent an hour trying to get back asleep. But i do have a lot of stuff on my mind so that could be it. I really feel like having lunch food, but its not time yet, so i guess ill just starve a little bit longer.  I guess im done, sorry bout that. Im a little groggy and confused and writing about it makes problems in my head seem really small and dumb. Mission accomplished.   Its a brand new year. can i get a HOO AHH?

      I got to go to state today, it was rather pleasent. I swam fast but not fast enough and found myself being the 17th fastest--but best looking--100 swimmer in the state of illinois. Im stoked.   about the conversation posted. Me and an old friend chris blasted each other about our life philosophy and im sure he feels just as much the winner as i. Forgive and forget.

      how long will this ride last?  so im starting to get ready for the big state meet. Im not nervous though, cause i dont really have any pressure on me. See I've accomplished so much more than anyone would give me credit for allready, so ive made my point, this meet is just a formality. I'm not expected to come in the top twelve which are the scoring places so i'm not worried about defending my spot. This makes me a very dangerous man since ive got nothing to lose. So basically im going to show up and swim my best and not worry about any of that other stuff because its not supposed to happen. If it does i'll be pretty darn excited and then ill get nervous. Funny how that works.   All these plans are being made for me and im not sure how much i like it. So my only response is to reject them. And now we get to the consequences. And i dont want to come off as negative about this situation cause i am very happy to be where i am. But now all the people who have been bugging me to do more more more have an actual reason to keep bugging me. So that means im going to have to break some hearts this summer when i dont swim club. On the plus side i do get to get dinner paid for on three seperate occasions as i go out with each coach and explain why i dont want to work my ass off every waking moment over the summer.   Water polo starts on monday. Now that is a fun sport. I wonder if i would mind doing that all year long. I wonder if i would be so good at swimming if i didnt have all this rage fueling it this year.

      Ive got a whole lot on my mind, none of it related.  I rocked sectionals yesterday. Dropped six seconds off my time and made the state cut with two seconds to spare. Then i spent a while trying to stand up, but it was worth it. AWSOME!  But now im getting all this praise. And its really weird cause im not used to it at all. What do i say? So im settling for thanks and an awkward grin and try to not turn too red.  and then theres this morning. Somehow lost the battle to sleep in and forced to go to church. So i figured its time for a religeon blasting session. Im sick of people defining themselves by what they dont do. Kids who use their religeon as the reason they dont drink or why they dont party or why they dont stay out past elevin. Its disgusting to see people use this entity as an excuse to make descisions for them. gross. But i think people get into the whole religeon thing because everyone is allways looking for someone to blame. Why not just blame one thing for everything. It simplifies stuff and you only have to worry about one thing instead of all these real factors. I just wish i could shake these people so they could realize they are kidding themselves. Kind of sad.  on a personal note. Im still wearing your ring and its brought me nothing but good luck so its not coming back anytime soon. Sorry

      so heres what happens when you get pressured  Tommorows sectionals. HUGE DEAL. So lucky me i got to spend today freaking out about it. I'm really weird like that. At any given meet i get so nervous i have to poop all the time. Like 5-6 times a meet. I literally get so nervous i scare the shit out of myself. So normally thats reserved for the meet. I got to experience that all of today. Not fun. My stomach was in knots all day. Then i had jackie come over to help me shave, cause im cute like that. And all that stress went away. Im pretty convinced shes my good luck charm. The trick is going to be channeling all that nervousness into explosiveness, i think i can do it.  Wish me luck, next post will either be super happy or disappointed, who knows.

      I feel so great and its just so perfect.  Love isnt the right word for whats between us. We need to be like greeks. The greeks have four different words for love. Thats what we need, cause i just keep hitting new levels. Im tripping over myself and laughing the whole way. Im loving every second of this ride and it keeps getting better. I could sit and watch and still be enthralled by your presence, this is all too much to ask for.  Im so in love, and i couldnt be happier.

      So i apologize, i came down a little hard on my friend last post. It wasnt meant to be a critisism of him being naive, it was supposed to be a warning. But not one that you ignore, one that really sticks with you and hopefully helps. I guess time will tell.  I sneaked into caits leadership class today and took this personality quiz thingy. Apparently i am a type two. Meaning im all about love and put others before me, and have the makeup of a saint. Blah Blah Blah. then the interesting part came in. Turns out if i become "unhealthy" I am a stalker or live vicariously through others. Im not sure how comfortable i feel about myself knowing that there is a stalker side to my personality. The other funny part is that its tottaly just an image of my mood at the time.I took that quiz last year and was something completely different, something along the lines of an authoritarian presence. So basically my personality changes on a regular basis. Guess i like to keep things mixed up.   Worst worst part of the survey. Jackie got the same result. Thats creepy. I wonder if its why we get along so well, or if we have been rubbing off on each other a lot. Either way its not what i expected since i see us as two very different people.

      Slamming this door shut ever so slowly  word got to me that a certain someone is in "love" with a girl he is not dating. This is something that i really worry about. Its not up to me to say how he feels, but saying your in love before your even in a relationship is a very dangerous thing. This is because you are not in love, guarenteed, ive been there and thought it, i was wrong. Love is something that developes between two extremely close people. I dont know what word applies to it, but love aint it. And when you start thinking that way you start building up this person in your head to be something much too perfect. Basically your setting yourself up for dissapointment. And the other thing is proclaiming love to some girl before the first date tends to freak them out just a wee bit. So my advice, grossly flawed and prolly wrong as it is, is to rename this emotion. Nothings wrong with it, just dont fool yourself into thinking its love cause its not. Trust me.  And all i want to do is breath into her neck

Such a good time, i can't even describe. I just want to do it again and again and again. Right now i could climb mountains, fuck i could move the mountains, im invincible at the moment.

      I love it how songs have such right on lyriics. Then when people hear them, they adapt them to what they want to hear. It's actually the bueaty of the medium.  It's funny how quickly you can fall into a routine. I'm not sure how much i like that. I like to be constantly surprised, sure there are many times in the past i can think of that i would like to re-create but whenever you try to build a feeling like that it never works. It seems like the unplanned stuff allways works out best. Thats why school kills me, its so structured my head almost explodes. Example: during last summer i got up at five, swam for 2 1/2 hours then off to my lifeguard job till eight and id go out till 11 or 12 every day. You know when i was tired? In the morning during practice cause it was the same all the time. I allways had variety at work and around with friends and energy to go with it even though i was running on five hours of sleep, maybe. Now im in school, and im fully awake for maybe three periods. Routine just brings you down. hard to keep the mind limber  Lately my house has been a lot of fun. Me and my mom are pulling out a bunch of old records. Paul Simon, Beatles, Simon and Garfunkle, aerosmith. Its just a lot of fun. The funny part is that my parents never like that music, but their friends gave em a bunch for their wedding. Thank you friends!

      No more posting on sudays. its not even how i feel 90% of the time. I should know that sundays are weird days and don should not go shooting his mouth off saying depressing things. And yet, it seems like such a good idea at the time.  I decided changing the title every time is dumb. So we are returning to the origional. It sums stuff up a lot better.  On the positive side, i finally finished my book. Pretty terrible that it took me about two months but hey, you cant rush those things.

      Im in a bad mood and i dont really know why. Sunday nights seem to do this to me cause everything is so slow. I had a fun day even. Went out with grace for a while and we managed to stir up some good times. But it all just seems like filler lately. Like the only time i really want to be around is with jackie. And i know thats not good. Because we both have other friends to see and jobs and sports to do. And its definatly not a smart thing to throw away your previous life for anyone, unless that is a very bad life which isnt the case here. It just sucks majorly that all this planning has to go on and all this running around has to happen just for one night a week. It gets me so frustrated cause im crazy about this girl that i get to see maybe half as much as id like.   But the funny part is all it takes is an hour or two of seeing her and everything is perfect. Its just id like to keep that feeling going for more than 24 hours. I need to stop thinking so much about this stuff.

      funny how a movie can make you want to change your life. I just saw this skiing documentary deal, and i just want to move to telluride colorado be a bus driver and ski when im not bussing people. I dont belong in the midwest. I belong in the montains with snow that actually has a use-skiing. And the worst part is since im going to france, i dont get to ski at all this year. I guess its a fair trade, but im missing out on my favorite thing to do in the world.

      Tonight i got to see a very old friend, the second oldest friend i can think of that im still in touch with. We went to see along came polly, and if you havent seen it, its very funny and very good.   Then i got to spend a quick nap session with jackie which makes me unbelievably happy evey time. She has to be full of something more addictive than any drug, its nuts how great i feel when im in contact with her.   Im way too happy to sleep

      This in from nequa: "you have to be physically attractive to have a chance with the opposite sex. That personality stuff is bullshit"  Now, im not sure what kind of people they have over at the richer part of naperville. But that is a terrible statement. First off, its shallow. And i really expected a lot more from such an intelligent person. Secondly, nobody wants a relationship with someone like that. Because people who think like that run out of conversation topics a good five minutes down the road. And finally, you start thinking like that and you change yourself. I used to be a rather large kid myself until eighth grade, then i adopted that philosophy. Only once i got to be "attractive" which i know doesnt matter now its just about being comfortable with yourself. Anyway once i got to the point i wanted to be at i found myself stripped of personality. I was a boring person. Luckily i ended up with some very charismatic friends, but if i hadnt found those people i would end up as a gym rat and do nothing but work out. Nobody likes that.   But seriously, thats terrible. Im not going to say looks dont matter, but they only are an attention getter. Kindof a way to "reel em in" thats where personality comes in. What im trying to say is drastic changes to ones appearence have drastic consequences and when your changing yourself to just look better, you are sacrificing what makes you an individual.

      I officialy am in posession of a pink dress shirt for the winter dance. My life is complete. I just hope its pink enough...  So close to being done. I hate this semester, i have NO fun classes and thats a very bad thing. So im really looking forward to this weekend. Maybe if im really lucky we'll get a snow day tommorow and i can see jackie for more than just one night! That would be amazing. But im not going to get my hopes up to high.  Maybe if we all cross our fingers as we sleep the snow will pour down and stop big bad school

      Im pretty sure religeon is the reason why we feel bad. So i got into a debate tonight with my mom aka super christian about gay marraiges. I say its their choice and im in no position to stop them. Then i whip out bible reasons like how no sin is worse than another and we let muslims and buddhists and cults practice in the U.S.A. and thats against the fucking commandments, being gay is never even directly addressed. So how do gay marraiges not be legal. I'll tell you why. A bunch of bigoted people hiding behind ambiguos bible verses. And im sorry mom, but not a single one of your arguements was concrete except that you want to save them not encourage them. But how can you save someone when you are responsible for their lives being a lot harder than they have to be? Its a crusade is what it is, and heres the scary part. She said the crusades werent necissarily a bad idea but some bad apples ruined it. Im a little scared after hearing that. I say i have no reason to hurt these people, and i would hate it if they did the same to me. So how does a book make this right?

      Big News! No more morning swim practices! How sweet it is.  maybe now ill start remembering things... at least i hope so. People tend to get a little miffed when i forget things they told me. Or maybe ill start doing the string around the fingers thing, i just need to find out how it works.   Super Sunday was fun. I didnt watch the game so much as play 4 hours of poker. And came out 24 bucks ahead. Im getting pretty damn good at cards nowadays. Is it addiction if your winning?  Who cares this rocks

      best four days i can remember.  So i realized in the car coming home from a game that there has to be transition. I can't just go from having my parents out of town and not breathing down my neck while i do my own thing to spending 15 days in France without dealing with them for a day. Think of this as affirmation that i want to go. No offense to anyone reading this, i love you all and wish you could come with. But to give you a picture i just spent an hour arguing about my future in swimming with my parents when i talk to them in the first time in four days.  I'll admit i was defensive since i had adrenaline pumping from my game. But come on, i dont want to fight. I just want to go about my business without them critisizing my life every step of the way.   I think the reason all this happened was i forgot my golden rule when dealing with the parents. Silence is the best way. The less i say the more they think i agree and the less fighting. It's actually really sad it has to be that way, but my developing mind tells me they wont change. I just hope they prove me wrong.  Positive thoughts: France is waiting. I will leave you all for 15 days, I know you'll make do. Communication will be limited but i am going to try to hit up an internet cafe every once in a while to give you all a heads up. Honestly, I feel like im in way over my head, but thats the funnest kind of situation ti be in.  Keep an eye out for me I promise to think of you all when i have time to catch my breath. I'll be thinking in french of course.  Au revoir

      its funny how you absorb all these feelings from books and television and billboards and mentors. But you never realize how much it all means until you feel it for yourself.  right now problems dont matter. People say a little bit of bad ruins a lot of good. But ive got way too much good for bad to even come close to ruining this.   something being so genuine it hurts to consider a lie

      i've got a secret that may make you gag  Heres what im thinking, im not a big fan of critisizing other peoples words but im going to do it now  This may be a surprise but every single person on this earth does things for themselves. There are the classic examples of someone selfish like a miser who everyone agrees is a selfish person. But lets think here, people do things because they want to, what makes them want to do it? Themselves. Everything you do is self obsorbed because its based on your needs. Not to put myself on a pedistal but i like to think im a pretty nice guy. And i am very selfish. How does this work? Easily, its not a parodox because making other people feel good and important and laugh is what i like to do. Its fun for ME to make other people happy. Im making people happy for my own selfish wants. It gets to the point where if i am not making someone happy i get sad. I don't like being sad, therefor, i selfishly try to make that person happy so i can feel better. That is very self obsorbed. The only difference between someone considered selfish and someone who is benevolent is that the benevolent person wants other people happy cause thats how they get happy, the selfish person only has to satisfy themselves to be happy. The greatest sacrifice in our culture: jusus being crucified was a very selfish thing. God wanted more people in heaven. So he sent jesus in to take that away so he could get more people in heaven. And jesus did it because he got his kicks off saving people.  So when you go out and say that you want to find someplace where people arent self obsorbed your living in a dream. Everyone is, its just a matter of where they put their energy. Every single human is flawed equally, its just a matter of where it is and how obvious it is.  Im on a roll, so i got another point to make.  Looking into the future does nothing except add unwanted pressure on your life. People who have great things going for them need to just step back and say wow. Not dream about how much better it could get. Because while your heads in the clouds you just may stumble and fall.  So if this applies to you shape up. Im not perfect, one of the dumbest people i know. But i refuse to accuse other people for problems only i can fix and i am determined to live in the wonderful now. I consider myself a work in progress and am determined to get better and stop complaining so much because i realize how ugly it sounds.   But that is hypocritical too since this whole post was a complaint. Oh well, at least i feel better now.   Self obsorbed eh?

      when it comes to people we are all farsighted  petes not smoking anymore. Fantastic, squares are dumb. Hes supposed to lay off for two weeks to prove hes not addicted. Great. Then jackie pipes up saying i have an addiction too. Awsome. So now i can't play poker or pete can start smoking again. Super. This makes me slightly, lets say aggrivated, cause i havent played in so long. Whoopedy-doo. But its hard to be mad at jak cause she was sitting close to me and laughing. Oh Boy  something weird happened when we parted today. We usually give this little kiss goodbye, which keeps me smiling for at least an hour, but something really different happened. You know when they say before you die your life flashes before your eyes. I know this sounds dumb but im dead serious when i say all these memories of her ran through my head in a split second right when i kissed her. It was a rush, i spent all of fifth sorting it all out and remembering that moment cause it was soo good. I guess the ironic part that i now have one of my favorite memories about a time that i remembered a bunch of memories.

      boiling  so tonight was another game. I did really well. 3 of our 11 goals and good defense. Then the other team, new treir, decided that they were going to start playing dirty. So they start picking on guys like me and kevin bell, others got it but they werent with the ball so much so it wasnt as noticable. And as much as i love being strangled as i get pushed under the water and some guy grabbing my junk, i dont like it in water polo. So i really fucked this guy up, elbowed his face a couple of times and twisted his hand back hard when he went to grab me. Keep in mind this was all him initiating this shit, i was good to let well enough alone. So when he starts pushing off with both feet in my stomach guess who gets the ejection? ME  great i got my second and third ejection in the fourth quarter and they were total bullshit. I wanted to get this guy so bad. Its probably good i got out cause i started saying to him i was gonna leave him bleeding on the bottom of the fucking pool. And the bastard still fucks with me. And i get punished. Wheres the justice?  kevin had it worse, he was screaming at the guy. Getting strangled for serious. he reallly wants to fuck up the reff for all those terrible calls.  This is just me venting, trying to calm down. Like i said its a good thing i had to stay out cause i was going to cause some serious damage to this kid. I dont usually get seriously angry about stuff. Normally i just walk away or it blows over, especially in polo games. The last time i was actually mad was with mike over a girl. Its actually a little scary how much adrenaline goes through my system, last time i just went running for a good 2-3 hours. Now all i can do is swim some laps.   Its just so dumb that six kids can decide to be bastards and make my best game of the season my worst. If i ever see them in the pool again they better watch out cause im not gonna do any of the cheap shit they pulled, its gonna be a brawl.   im going to go talk to rocky about it. That usually helps.

      its scary how few people are around at elevin. I hate this shortened curfew deal.  You may think that through all these poems ive been writing and such that my life as far as romantically is concerned is perfect and that im embellishing. Well, your wrong. It really is that good and i really am that deep and i really do spend that much time thinking about her (non creepily) when shes not around.   shes so beutiful in every way i cant handle it sometimes and have to close my eyes  give me any task. At this moment i have enough energy to complete anything. And im too optimistic for impossible.

      So i went bowling with one of my new favorite people: Nate Meeley (?). I enjoyed it much.  I was watching chasing amy and realized how conditioned the public is to sex. I mean i really wonder what would happen if everyone wasnt trying to top everyone else in these exploits. Not to be a prude, im just as willing as the next. But im almost positive i would be a lot less ---- lets say agressive---- if there wasnt all these images constantly bombarding. It's weird, cause im not even that sex driven compared to some. I dont even know what im trying to say. This doesnt connect to anything in my life except i feel this switch click in my brain when these images come around. I hate that feeling.  But then everything shapes your personality. people places whatever. So maybe im just copping out by blaming the tv. Because they wouldnt be doing it if we didnt ask for it. in that case the blame lies squarly on my shoulders along with all of you reading this. Now i feel guilty.   Ive solved nothing

      First water polo game of the season done. HOO AHHH!  I played good if you were wondering  i was reading some of Swanbergs latest stuff and i kind of laughed at something i noticed. We are very subtley rubbing off on each other. I've kindof picked up on his sense of flow and the idea that anything is a metaphor and how to keep it going, and he did this funny thing lately that made me say to myself "thats exactly the way id say it" I like it, i know at least im getting better, and we are still very very different, and hes still a lot better than me. But im fine with that. Just fun to notice

      All i can see through platic layers and wind  is cold concrete in the sun  Broken up with white lines pointing my thoughts east  toward you like the dream last night you were there with me  I said i love you and your nose dissapeared shaking me awake  With this idea of you stuck in my head clawing to escape  these small spaces i let it out it wandered over to you  I felt it circle your ear Building momentum breaking its orbit  sped back to me slammed into my forehead with a triumphant yell  through the stars i saw the color of the eyes i never quite know  but i do know i wish I could fly to you because this plane isnt fast enough

      in case you were wondering i went to heaven this weekend.  I realized i didnt really tell a whole lot of people i was going skiing in CO this weekend, sorry if you feel left out. BUT IT WAS THE BEST EVER EVER EVER EVER. I had so much fun. I was a little worried about being with my dad and his friend but his friend is the best ever. I was worried since hes 52 and all complaining about not being able to keep up and then he went so fast. I couldnt keep up with him. Hes a really cool guy. Anyone whos over 50 and runs marathons is bad ass in my book.  So heres what im going to do. Im gonna get some helicopters and transport naperville people i like to the base of coper mountain. It'l be all good. Im not gonna lie, i didnt miss any of you while i was skiing. But the whole post skiing pre-sleeping thing was kinda lonely. This way i wont miss anyone! And if you dont ski ill teach you and youll love it.

      i wonder how much of my life is based off rebelling.  --  if i took a video  of me and you how would i look to my third person?  i could edit you out watch me holding nothing then really look at my eyes to see how im really feeling  its not that im not sure i couldnt mistake this happy but if you were in it id be too fascinated to watch me

      well...i guess...it's ok  I'm not going to lie, a little dissapointed on the whole winter picture thing. they just turned out lame. I really need to work on my "photo face" but im kindof messed up in the head there. I don't think ive smiled with my teeth in almost two years (since i got braces). I dont think im going to start either. But something needs to be done, cause its pretty bad. But thats not really important is it?   I'd like to think im above all that obsession over looks but im not at all. I dont care about clothes so much but ive been finding myself worrying about my body in general. I dont have a negative self image, but i can allways find something to "fix". I guess the good thing is then i go "fix" it and dont sit around and whine about it, but i wonder why i care so much. Maybe its my obsession with bigger and better, maybe its this cultures obsession reflected in me. But im justifying it by saying i refuse to be static, i can either go forwards or backwards. Backwards is easier, but i choose forwards.   But the best part of the pictures was jackies face. She was so so dissapointed, i felt kinda bad. As if it was my fault. It just didnt turn out good is all. this topic doesnt justify writing this much about it.

      all i can say is its a good thing mike is around and its a good thing that im finally getting my barings.  So lately I've been in this weird state of mind. But i finally confronted the issue today and things are looking way up.   And me and mike continue the cycle of giving each other advice, good advice at that, and then completely ignoring the advice received and doing something more or less completely opposite of that advice.  the problem is when you look to the future things seem so uncertain it scares you. I've been running scared for a couple of weeks now and im finally out of breath and settling down.

      bill came to the water polo game. I was happy to see him. It was a really physical game too so i think he got a good taste of the violence he was expecting.   I was playing rough tonight and really good. So in the fourth quarter we were winning by a good amount and coach pulled me. Then this kid tells me that the kids im playing are giving me the worst looks and look like they want to kill me.   Which got me to wondering am i a physical player or a dirty player? Because my goal is to be a tough physical player that no one wants to be with cause they'll get shut down. What i dont want to be known as is the dirty kid whos a bastard and everyone hates. So i started asking a bunch of kids and they all said i wasnt being dirty, just physical and having my way with kids. So that made me happy.   Moral of the story: nobody likes a bastard. Make sure you arent one.

      I'm kindof drifting right now  I'm not entirely sure what to do with myself, this is a weird phase to be in for me. I feel like ive become stagnant since i got back. And thats my worst nightmere. I need to suck it up and mix things up. It's happened before and ive successfully mixed it up and it worked, so consider this a remix.   I need summer here right now. I need a time when there are few responsibilities so i can see her without going through a bunch of hassles.   don't get me wrong, i am loving water polo and we are doing awsome and may win state. And i will fight till im exhausted to get that title. But i am really looking forward to not having people lean on me in a team sense. I just want to run around and see the girl i love without these issues in the back of my head.  Either i am particuarly crazy or the crazy side of me is just more obvious lately.

      Me, I'm just drawing my battle lines.  It's none of my business but someone i know needs to take a long hard look at themselves and realize they are becoming more boring by the second. One demensional people are rarely that interesting and your getting there slowly but surely. Everyone gets wrapped up in this kindof stuff, you use that excuse all the time. But few do it to this extent.  I couldnt be more happy with where i am. I just need to wake up and realize it. Everytime im with her i can see how great i have it, but it kindof blurs sometimes. Introspection is in order.

      If you want to see a very competetive water polo game of Central Vs. North show up at Centrals pool at 5:00 on wendsday.  I've been feeling very all over the place lately. My emotions arent very anchored right now. I bounce from delirously happy to sullen and everywhere else in the space of a few hours and its confusing me.   For some reason these questions keep coming up in my mind about people i know. And it just kindof nags at me. Then i solve the problem and everythings ok again.   My minds kindof in overdrive i guess. I'm not seeing problems im looking through them and runnning face first into them.  But for some reason im not displeased with this. Maybe i just need things to settle down and ill be ok.

      Don't get me wrong, I love mankind, I just don't like most people.  Today wasn't a very good day for my perceptions of things. The whole relationship thing started actually registering with me. I can't blame anyone for wanting to be with their boy or girlfriend as much as possible because i want it too. And i really can't tell if i only feel this way because im not with her all the time even though that would be great. But im starting to realize this is all wrong.  We had a big group of friends. We all got girlfriends and boyfriends except for a few. Now that group doesnt exist anymore. there is no big group anymore because no one thought to include their boy/girlfriend in our group. There is something wrong when you allways sideline people for just one person, however it is perfectly allright to do it sometimes to frequently. Because i realize that person is important to you, but your losing your old life by doing this.  But the worst part about this situation, even though it is a very good situation, is distraction. Today i watched as two people who usually have a lot of fun and are very active with everyone around completely alienate themselves and do their own thing.   So heres my point. If you are so entirely wrapped up in each other great. But do it on your own time. There are other things to dating then being in constant contact and being intimate all the time. So throw the rest of us a bone every once in a while and be the normal you. I'll try to do the same

      Im still breathing  I wonder how many people are hiding things from others. Like where they go and what they do and what hurts them to hear but is uncool to say it hurts.  Cause i know i do that sometimes, but ive been trying to fix that and be honest. It's a very sad feeling to hide things. That fake smile only makes you feel worse

      if i could pick the way that my funeral was. It would have hundreds of people come like greg vasich had. Everyone on this planet can only hope to touch that many people.  The priest said he lived 100 years in 23. I agree.  Maybe i can learn something from this. All i know right now is i want live 100 years in my life too.

      think of me as burnt out  think of me as completely confused as to where i went  think of me as someone who can't see what's right in front of him but knows its there  think of me as looking for what i really am  cause ive changed a lot, and ive said it before how i change my personality for every person i know. And its making me sick. I'm not sure if its that i havent been with the people who i like the best and like my personality the best when im around them. Or if im just fucking worn out from changing my definition for every one.   The sad part is that i don't even know how i would stop even though i want to. The scary part is I don't know what it feels like to be one person all the time. The worst part is i can't ignore it any longer.  All my weaknesses have been flying into my face lately. I need to not just ignore it this time around

      People need to realize that everything isnt about them. People need to stop and think about the person who is having the problem. Other people are there for support, not to make those without feel worse.  I caught myself making this sadness mine. I caught myself thinking about how this affected me. And i remembered Chuck P. in Invisible Monsters saying the vast majority of people are preoccupied with licking their own lumpy assholes like dogs. Its fucking true, i have no right feeling sorry for myself.  Im not sorry, its not my fault and its not really my pain. Im just so incredibly sad that this had to happen. I want to find a way to shove any positive energy i have into the people who actually have this pain.

      fuck you for taking this. Fuck you for hitting the ideal family so hard. You deserve every fucking thing you get for this. And you deserve more.   I want you to allways know that moment. I want you to have been able to see through the haze of drugs and see what you have done. Nothing you can do can ever repay this. You ruined something great, and your life is trash.

      In case you haven't heard. Greg Vasich died in a car accident. Visitation on tuesday from 3-8 at frederick jones.  You better fucking get there, he was one of the smartest and kindest people i've ever known.  To chris: ask me for anything and you've got it. This is not an idle promise.

      somehow sitting here doesnt feel right.  i wonder how ill deal with not being constantly busy anymore. Right now i feel like a waste of space, but Liz is coming into town today so thats exciting.  I don't really understand how i feel. I saw jackie last night which was great cause i missed her a lot. But right now its just weird.  It's like i finally got time to give a big sigh and sit down, but i pushed all the air out of me and am gasping for breath. I am really happy to be home with the people that i love to be around with but there are so many strings attached. School and stuff.  I think i really am happy just a little tired and bored right now since im so used to running around by now. And i dont get to see her for the rest of the weekend. one day out of 18 isnt that bad. Right?  ok

      success  I'm actually really surprised that i managed to stay focused for three hours writing a paper on a book i only read half of. And it's actually a pretty good paper too. It's those little victories that are nice.  Memorial weekend. My first thought is yuck since all the family on my dad's side is coming to town. There is going to be A LOT of drama. But then, liz is coming home too. Maybe me and her will just run off and have our own fun like we usually do.  either way, jackie is out of town. That makes me a sad panda.

      whopee  awards ceremony tonight. Kinda a little bit of me saying goodbye to the jock part of me for about six months.   Whats really cool though is i am on the all-sectional team for water polo. So that basically means that i am one of the best players in our sectional which actually includes a bunch of good schools. I'm pretty darn pleased with that.  other than that, things are just nice.

      where im at this world is way too slow  saw the movie that stef made. I like it a lot. It's actually really awsome that i know people creating great art. My thoughts are this: there has never been a more correct statement about bill, stef is really good at directing, and i really hope i dont walk like that in real life.  Then i saw shrek 2 with jackie and a bunch of other people. Its actually an awsome movie. So funny!  I feel my inner 4 year old coming out again. He kinda went away for a while but he's back with a power. Im really really really happy.

      thought id give you a heads up...  works like this: when im happy i really dont have a lot to say. I could beat you over the head with it OR i could just say that this is a very good time for Don's right now. All the stuff that seems important is going very well and the other stuff can be ignored.  I know it won't last but im really starting to get the hang of the troughs and crests of my behavior in wave format.

      around...  the seniors are nice kids. I like that class. I had alot of fun running around with them tonight. Laura Johns is one of the coolest people i know.  Funny story: i was playing darts and one didnt stick and fell towards the floor. So my thought process was literally this: "oh no, it would be bad if it hit the floor going so fast, i better stick my BARE FOOT out to break the fall." So now i have a small hole in the center of my big toenail and it was bleeding for a while. I'm an idiot.

      thoughtful  i found out recently that there is this certain someone in a relationship right now. Thing is this person has a crush on someone other than the person they are currently dating. They would go from their current girl/boyfriend to be with this other person in a heartbeat. And i know if they are reading this they will know i am talking about them but i gotta say this.  I think that is the sadest thing i have ever heard. The person that this person is dating means, in the end, nothing to them if they really feel that way. The whole scenario is basically the person saying "im not completely happy in this relationship, but im going to stay with you because i dont have any other options." What happens if that person actually means something to the one they are dating? It's terrible.  I cant think of a worse position i could be in than to just be filling in the space before jackie's real crush becomes availiable. Its just manipulative.  i never knew people could actually be like that

I'm happy to announce that i am officially on top of the world again. I spent a little time being kinda lame. But im feeling definatly over it now. I'm not just saying it like i was before. Things are definatly better than ok.  blah blah blah

      violence is the only answer.  Movie making tonight for stef's wishes film. We got to stage a fight. Only me and urlakis just ended up fighting for real except our punches were very light. It was a lot of fun.I feel kinda bad though, since we were getting really into it and i ended up picking him up over my shoulder and then semi-slamming him down. He said his rib hurts but he has no complaints.  My wish: bill's car get better soon.

      Every one else is doing it, why not me?  I found out today about the american contracter killed in iraq. This country is going to shit. It really is terrible.   I think the worst part is that there is no one i can really blame. Because the american soldiers who tortured the iraqis are clearly out of line, but that does not justify other iraqis sawing an innocent man trying to rebuild the country's head off. Its all so horrific i can't stop denying the fact that this is real life. I just want it to stop. I dont care what it takes, but people need to stop dying over the most ridicullus reason of all: religeon.   I want it to stop.

      na na na na, na na na na. Hey hey hey, good-bye  turns out our friend chris hayes is a terrible child. You see once upon a time, chris had a blog. Very similar to this one only much more stylish. But chris was very bad. He SWORE on his blog. Luckily chris's mom came and rescued him from his evil vice and reminded him that he was going to hell for his swearing. So now everyone is happy!  To chris's mom. That is pretty fucked up. maybe you should fucking get over yourself and look around at the shit thats going on around you. Better yet, maybe you should fucking let your son be his fucking self.  yes i am going to hell. that was all of 5 swears back there. but i like warm weather.

      The worst thing i can imagine is having to depend on someone.  Don't get me wrong, i really like people. But depending on just one person would be really bad. Because people arent perfect, and you can't expect them to be. You can lean on them, but you should never depend on them for your happiness etc.  This all came around in my head because i decided to watch the real world on MTV. These kids get a free vacation to the Greek Islands and this one girl is hating every second because she wants to be with one of her friends.  When you arent particuarly close with someone where you are. Get to know them. Life is as much fun as you make it out to be. I realize there are favorite people in your life and things are definatly better with them there, but you cant depend on them to be there.  think of yourself as a piece of architecture. You can be a wall where if the others fall you crumble. or you can be an arch and depend on yourself.

      Nobody likes to hear bad news.  the jeep came back all fixed up. Except for a little ity bitty problem with the engine.... So i guess the starting system needs a little work. And i guess i really want my car to just be a cool car and not have ridicullus amounts of expensive problems that consume months of work.  other than that water polo is going to state after a pretty tough sectional tournament.YAY! i promise to try my hardest to give central a state title.

      i had dinner with my grandpa tonight. Outside of liz id have to say he is my favorite family member. He's just damn cool. I want to be something close to that when i grow up, cause everyone likes him.  It was kindof weird though because today would be the day my grandma turned 81. Which just makes me really sad and he didnt seem to be very happy about it either. It's gotta be hard to lose someone you have been married to for over fifty years. And he was by her side all the time, the last two years of her life was spent with him right by her side. I'm sure he is the reason she lasted that long....  thinking about that made me realize how extremely deep love can be. I love jackie a lot, and if she was ever in trouble i would be there to help her so fast. But to spend the better part of five years caring for someone who is slowly dying, and two of them while she is bed ridden. All without anything approaching a complaint or asking for help. It just astounds me.  But the good news to this story i guess is that my grandpa is now remarried. Her name is Joe and she has been a family friend since before i was born. She is really awsome. Together they are the really cool old couple going to plays and art exhibits all the time. And what makes me really happy is that my grandpa, who never slept in the same bed as my grandma for as long as i can remember, is sharing a bed with her. I spent a good half hour smiling about how great it is that he has found someone. Its not that shes replacing my grandma, but she is doing a great job of filling the void that used to be there.  and this is all happening to people 60 years older than me. Love love love

      im not better than anyone  this is a concept i need to comprehend. Its not that i am not unique, its just that i am not as exempt as i would like to think. I kid myself all the time when its really just a bunch of coincidences that brought me here. And i am so happy here its nuts.   but i am not more special than the next guy. I have different strengths is all.   I was talking with kids at lunch about how everyone fills a niche within their grade. Then i read this thing for biology that says humans follow inherent behaviours that just are that way for no reason. I just happened to land on an awsome niche.  i can go anywhere and be anything i know this. It's just a matter of consequences of my descisions. And it works out i get exactly what i wanted. Or is it needed? Or does it matter which.  Eventually we take care of ourselves and get what our specific mind wants. And i want this.  What im thinking. Fuck controlling yourself. When you are not yourself you make descisions that put you somewhere you dont want to be. I may be an anomolly but i was whatever i wanted and now im here with the best girl i could find. And love is the best state to be in. And i want this to last.

      we are all growing up way too fast.  My sister Liz has no more college classes to take, she graduates on wendsday. That's fucked up. She doesnt have a job yet and doesnt have any place to go really after that weekend which is her national ultimate championship in washington.   I really have no idea what im going to do if she doesnt move back to the chicago area. I ve gotten so used to seeing her on holidays and then we hang out together in the summer when both of us are bored. Thats really sad.  And whats even worse is shes going to have to change to fit into the business world. Shes going to have to dress nice and act nice all the time. I guess thats what scares me the most. Her becoming something neither her or me want to become.  I would have liked to go see her graduation and tournament, cause i feel like thatl be the last time i can see "that" form of liz. But the sectional tournament for water polo starts wendsday and then theres going to be a huge family reunion that weekend. Since my grandpa got remarried all the relatives 0n my dad's side have been itching to come out and celebrate the wedding. Its like a delayed reception i guess.  but im really going to miss liz. Shes my favorite.

      back in... white  people don't fit in boxes. I find myself trying to label people all the time and it really doesnt work. Example, in michigan i put everysingle person in a group. Jocks, geeks, and christians. But everyone there surprised me. And i felt kinda guilty about labeling them in the first place. I think i did all that judging because i thought i was better than them. Which isnt true. And im dissapointed in myself for being such a dumb ass. Its weird though because my labels are all right outside of church. But when you place these people in an enviorment without pressure all of a sudden they become individuals. I guess the moral of the post is no one is what they seem at first glance. Someones true person comes out only when they are not threatened in any way. So its your job to make them feel unthreatened and get to know them.

      the world would be a scarier place if micheal moore wasnt keeping an eye on it.  i really would like to personally thanking micheal moore for making so many people aware of glaring problems. He is pretty much fixing this country, or at least trying really hard.

      the clouds they hung around  I am now back for the summer. I had a great time in santa barbra. But i dont really feel like bloggin right now.  If you want to hear about it. Call me, we will walk and talk. Stories are just better that way.

      the best part: i forgot about the world when i was with you  Just when summer starts to get a good feel going. BAM, I'm shakin things up and traveling for a while. It'l all work out, 14 days isnt that much of a deal. I'm not going to really be able to contact anyone except maybe when i spend one night in naperville after coming back from michigan and then fly out to santa barbra the next morning. But chances are, I'll be thinking of you.  I'll try to stay humble and next time you see me i'll prolly have a crazy california tan.

      i can almost touch it  I was driving today and spotted 6 dead birds in the road along my 15 minute drive. And I'm thinking that's really sad. I wish birds would be a little bit smarter and stay away from cars. Nobody likes dead robins in their street.  I found out today that i really hate the idea of people depending on other people. Or more specifically one person depending on another person. I can understand attached, and i can understand favorite people to be around. But as soon as people start depending on one sole person something is fucked. Because people let you down. There are no exceptions. I'm not saying to not have faith in people. But i am saying that you set yourself up for an unecessarily bad time if you become dependant. People need to fix their own problems and then move out in the social world, not expect the social world to fix their problems.

      i had summer for four hours  Bill and me decided that after having a jolly good time with Mr. Digiovanni's final we needed burrito's. And as we sat there the thought occured that we had a lot of time on our hands and nothing to do with it. Outside of studying that is...  So i figure ive got all this money from my grandparents for my birthday, why not hit up best buy. Picked up a couple of quality films and tried to talk bill out of freaking out about being in such a yuppie store. Then we met this nice regester girl and watched pulp fiction at Bill's.  I was thinking about best buy and the semi accusations made against it being so, well, wrong for music. I guess my view is there really is no alternative. If there was a underground record store around like the ones Liz showed me in Boulder, i would spend most of my time there. But instead I'm left with this starched out over processed store. And yet, i dont really have a problem with that. It's the cheapest i can get the stuff i want as long as its there. I guess i just have a lot of trouble feeling angry at a store.  finals?

      Good news: I am 17 today Bad news: the day before finals is clearly the worst day for a birthday  I'm just kinda chillin around my house right now. I feel like birthdays are allways rough because there is so much pressure for them to be great. It's kinda that way with everything. The best days of my life have been when i wasnt expecting anything to happen and then something amazing happened. And its really hard for me to focus on studying right now since i keep saying "fuck it, its my birthday. I get to do what i want"   Im thinking me having a celebration, if there ever is one, will have to go on hold for a while. Aren't I exciting?  P.S. i know i allways feel bad when some friend of mine has a birthday and i forgot or never heard about it so i want all those to know. You can't be blamed for forgetting cause i didnt really tell anyone. So whatever you do don't feel sorry. Maybe just slightly amused that i spent my birthday studying.

      It's all so....  There are times when im with her. It's kind of odd. And I am fully convinced in the first place that she is the most beautiful girl around. But there are these moments i have where i catch my breath. There are all these little things she does that make her so incredible. And all i can do is hold my breath. Because i know that if i didnt do that i would do something akward and ruin the moment. I just love how we work together.   Or at least I'm so...perfectly happy that I am still being amazed by her on a regular basis

      Through the charlaten holes. You've been slipping been slipping away.  Swanberg Kalish and Benjamin all came over today to throw. It actually made my day. I like to run around and i need to get in better shape. So this way i can do that and have a lot of fun messing around with people.   I guess Brandon is having a hard time now though. Its really sad i think. But the weird thing is that i have been saying for about a year that he would definitly get into all that sooner or later. I guess that I am surprised that other people are surprised. I think something needs to be done to stop him though, cause his personality definitly doesnt allow him to engage in those activities lightly. I just wish someone could convince him its not cool to be obnoxiously under the influence...

      testing  I'm really hoping that i will be able to stay with this daily walk thing. It's really nice to get some energy out in the nice weather. I got to think a lot and listen to birds....far out.  But one thing i was thinking about is how people can change for the worse. I was talking to an old friend today and they just started talking. And they didnt stop. And there wasnt anything important to what they were saying. Someone who used to be a pretty cool person is now obsessed with the filler in life. Its kind of sad. Because filler doesnt do anything for you but help you annoy others.  Stay focused on what matters.

      I feel bad about not feeling bad  I went for a really nice walk with rocky today. I'm thinking that I should do that a lot more. It's healthy and relaxing. What more could you ask for?'  Unfortunatly my good friend Hannh's parents completed their divorce today. Thats really sad. I dont even know how to react since ive never experienced anything approaching that in my life. My parential problems have allways been because they love me too much and are really big creeps that don't understand kids at all. It all just makes me hate people. They can be such dousches.  these lies don't get us anywhere

      feining interest.  its odd. I don't really have much control on whats happening or going on lately. I'm just kind of playing along. It's weird and generally uncomfortable.  I really wonder if girls really find self confidence endearing or if its just because its a rare thing.

      Almost certain failure  That last post i made, the one about the eyes, it opened up a new world today. With that little paragraph i created a charecter. I've decided that this is a charecter clearly defined enough in my head that he's worth writing a book about. I kinda started it, i think the trick is learning to really draw a moment out to get all the good stuff.  But anyway, this charecter. I think his name will be Paige. Basically he's a combination of the worst part of two of my personalities. You all know now (i hope) that i unconsciously change who i am depending on the people i am with. So to get paige, i take all the self confidence, swagger, and desire to be the best from my jock side and put it with all the bitter judgemental thoughts i have in my more thoughtful state. So Paige is kindof this intolerant, unhappy, smart-ass.   It's funny though because what im doing is im taking people i know and stripping them down to be good or bad. Theres only room for so much grey in a book after all. It's kindof like im imagining what life would be like if i hated the people i like.   But then, odds are this will never be completed

      The trick is to control your eyes at all times. All that shit about body language telling people what your feeling--newsflash--its not important. Because what really matters is your eyes. Your eyes are the window people use to peek into what your really up to. All you have ever heard from the time you could understand is emotions are in the eyes. You control your eyes, you control peoples perception of you. No more peeping toms seeing you. It's odd how most people you meet are looking for a weakness. Don't let them see it, even if they expose it, if you don't show any change in your eyes no one thinks your hurt. Control your eyes and you control the situation around you.

      the bullets may singe your skin  so my experiment worked out. I have an idea of who im talking to. 11 people who are interested in my thoughts and one person named "anonymous" that seems to be really mad at me for wondering who is reading my posts.  so, anonymous, i dont really understand your negative comment. This is a public blog. And i have never treated this as a private journal since i knew at least swanberg was reading this. But the whole idea behind this is i can say thoughts in this context that i would keep inside me anyways. And then i get to be happy that other people are benefitting from these thoughts, whether they agree or no. I beleive that exposing yourself to as many thoughts as possible is good for you.  I hope you arent angry, i allways try to make it clear when im trying to piss people off.

      turn  I let go of a bunch of my worries since last post. Worked out pretty well. i should reguarly get rid of worries, maybe the i wouldnt freak out.  i guess im going to the university of Iowa tommorow. I'll be gone thursday night and back by friday night. I'm really curious to see what an official tour will be. Cause my only college experience so far has been hanging out with my sisters and thats educational in a different sense.   I will see you all soon

      its good to be alone  I havent posted for a long time. I blog when i have time to think. I havent been thinking so much as reacting for a long time now.  I spent the night alone tonight. I had to catch my breath. I talked a while ago about how i hate people depending on people. I think i proved to myself tonight that i am still self-sufficient. I'm not proud so much as delighted that i dont need somebody all the time.  Not that i am antisocial, but odds are i like me more than i like you on nights like these.

      do you want to learn to fly? would you like to see me try?  i feel like i go through this ritual every month where i freak out at life in general. I just start demanding all these things to happen from myself and everyone around me. Pretty sure its unhealthy.  you can only hold that kinda thing in for so long. I ended up venting meaningless pent up feelings to someone close tonight and i feel bad.  SERENITY NOW!

      im assuming you love me. I'm assuming you know what that means  I think the one thing that gets me consistantly really really sad is when people have no respect for themselves. I can get mad at a war, i can make someone feel guilty for making a bad descision. But somehow when i hear about people who have given up standing up for themselves i get kinda depressed.  this is all coming about because another guard today told me about how they were hanging out with this other couple. The girls was wearing a short skirt and no underwear, so the ass-hole of a boyfriend decided to show off her--umm---assets to everyone there. Her response? laughing. That's fucking sick is all i have to say. A big part of me wants to hurt that guy for doing that to someone.

      tilted back  ive been swimming a lot lately which means i do a lot of thinking. Lucky you, i have things to share on this blog. But its kind of weird because the thoughts that hit me at 5:30 are really bizzar. i spent an hour contemplating if i could knock a kid out by swimming head first at him and headbutting him. I think i could pull it off and if im lucky id go down too.  I've got traffic court today for my huge ticket. Too nervous to nap so i decided to see what the pop music scene is up to. Theres this song that sounds clean and feel good called "you're the only one" It was really sad to me though. It's this girl singing about this boy who she laughs at the size of his dick and generally puts him down, but he's allways there to hold her hair back when she gets drunk and pukes. What the fuck? I really wouldn't feel sad if the opening line was, "Well I saw you with your hands above your head Spinning around, trying not to look down But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground."   and this is what passes as love

And even the bad ones look like good ideas to me right now.  could be worse, could be raining
