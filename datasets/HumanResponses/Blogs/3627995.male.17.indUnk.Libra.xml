      hey, well im kind of pissed because my server had decided all on its own not to work. That means i have to unhook a bunch of shit from my computer and figure out what the problem is on the server. So far whenever i try to access my data i will be allowed to see the root folders but not any of the subdirectories. Then the window im in crashes and no more mr.server. Today im supposed to go over to aarons and help him format his computer. From what he says he thinks he's got a virus, which is entirely probable because he's on an always on connection with no firewall. I called kevin and asked if he was coming but there was no answer so i left a message. Also ive been thinking about asking out ulyssa (i dont think i spelled it right). Shes a year younger than me but is really hot and nice to boot. im not sure what she'll say though, i know that she wanted to go out with aaron but they never went on a date as far as i know. As far as morgan is concerned i will probably ask her if she wants a real relationship, and if she says no than no harm no foul. I hung with tanner yesterday, that was pretty cool. We played Perfect Dark on N64 for a while and i got my ass handed to me. Usually im the winner at FPS's but im not good with the N64's controller so i didnt do too well. Also Karen got pissed off at me and tanner. Tanner and I had been watching TV for a while than karen came home and when The Simpsons were over we were looking around the channels and found the Spanish version of Family Fued. As a joke tanner turned it on. Neither one of us wanted to watch it for very long but karen did because she kind of speaks spanish. so me and tanner started talking and she got pissed because she couldnt hear. I didnt really give a shit but tanner being her boyfriend had to make up. Also i went and picked up my pay from the pizza place i work at then went home. All and all it was an okay day yesterday, would have liked to be out more. "He is a fool who builds his house on sand"

      This log isnt about a day or anything that has happened to me but i just want to write it down.  This is what i want out of some things.  School- A good education is one of the things i value most. Stupid, ignorant people are probably one of my biggest things that piss me off. I go to school, i pay attention in class as well as i can and do as little homework as possible so that i can get my A and go home.   Home life- For this one im not sure what to write. I like being out of the house so i guess thats saying something.  Friends- I expect my friends to treat me as well as i treat them. I have about seven or eight people who i know i can trust and if i get into some kind of trouble will help me out. Friends have become an important part of my life in the last couple years. This is true because before high school i didnt have many friends outside of school so now i try to keep the ones i have and possibly make some new ones along the way. There is one thing right now that i am regretting. And thats that im not spending enough time with Tanner. But i have a reason for this. For the past couple years he has been my best friend. Which is still true. But all we ever do is sit around Joe's house and watch tv. This gets really boring after 2 and a half years. so now i spend more time with kevin because frankly im out and doing things with him. im going to try to find things to do with tanner, im hoping that will be successful.   Relationships- = What i would like a relationship to consist of is being able to tell my girlfriend anything and to have her true and honest opinion no matter how much it could hurt me. I want to be able to go out and have fun with her and have it be just the two of us, While hanging out with friends the rest of the time. I guess that what it comes down to is that im more old fashioned. By this i dont mean that i am a prude, in fact its the exact opposite. As long as i like a someone enough making love could happen on the first date. Not that i think that will ever happen. But i guess what im saying is that i dont like one night stands and that i want there to be more than just fucking to a relationship.  My Car- For it to work. Piece a Crap.  People im working with- One of the things that pisses me off the most is when im working my ass off at a job and the jackoff next to me is doing nothing. Thats probably the part of my personality that people hate the most. I tend to get angry at what i dont think is fair or equal. I've lost a lot of friends that way.  Thats all i think is worth writing for now on what i expect or want from assorted crap. Also, lastly dont(!) ask me for money. I hate when people ask me for money. This however this has limits. If someone asks me repeatedly for money i wont give it to them but if its something like we're at a store and they run out of cash and want to buy something than i could care less and i'll borrow them the money. But if the person is always asking for money for food or anything over and over again than you'll find that i'll get pissed off pretty quick.   "Never expect more than what the loser in the corner is going to give you"

      hello, im righting this on the same night as "Feeling low" only because i try to space my logs out by days and to seperate the events in each day with a different log (im not sure if this is the norm but what the fuck). Well i woke up in erics room at about 10:30 or so if i remember right, but who knows if thats right or not. after we woke up we sat around erics room for a couple of hours and tried to figure out what was going on. kevin got a call from Gary about band practice and it was called off because kevin was too tired to play (i believe this is correct because i didnt ask kevin if they did have practice or not so i could be wrong). Well i ended up driving sarah and kevin home and then went home myself to mow the lawn. So i dropped them off then went home and mowed my lawn, which took about and hour and a half or so. When i came back inside from doing the lawn i found that kevin had called me so i called him back and he said that they were going to crystal lake to get sarahs nose ring ball replaced because she lost it. so i took a shower and got ready. What im about to write next is extremely graphic so if you have any qualms about blood or death than skip the following parts (arrow to arrow).   -->Kevin called me back after i got out of the shower and told me to meet him at Grant so i got my crap together and walked out the door. As i did this i looked to my left and saw two rabbits. these rabbits have been playing in my back yard ever since i moved in and my dog likes to freak out whenever he sees them so getting rid of them would help. So upon seeing them i quickly went inside and got my bow out of the case and grabbed two good arrows. I ran to the front door of my house and placed one of the arrows just on the inside of the door and placed the other on the rest of my bow. Now i have been shooting bow and arrow for 6 or 7 years now and am pretty proficient at it. But the problem is that i havent gone shooting in about a year so i wasnt exactly sure about how far i needed to be for the sight to be accurate. I placed myself at what seemed to be the right distance from the rabbit and pulled back the string on my bow. I looked down the sight of my bow and steadied myself then released. The arrow landed in the rabbits back right thigh and proceeded to go threw the lower abdomen and out the left thigh. It attempted to run away but was slowed by the arrow. So i dropped my bow onto the ground and ran after it. This would be a good time to mention that this is the middle of the afternoon and in the front of my house. also the rabbit proceeded to run into my neighbors yard so i had to get it fast. At the same time as the rabbit ran away the UPS man pulled up right behind a bush which was covering where i was. So anyway, i ran after the rabbit, he got no farther than fifteen feet before i caught him. As i was running to catch him i pulled my pocket mutitool and retrieved the knife from it. as i caught the rabbit i pulled the arrow out of its leg tried to cut the rabbits throat. This however proved to be futile because the knifes edge would penetrate the thick hide of the rabbits skin. So i then punctured the rabbits lung with the knife by stabbing it once in the side between the ribs. This still did not kill it. So running out of ideas i picked up the kicking rabbit and brought it and my arrow inside my front door. Inside the front door of my house i have a tile floor and placed the rabbit there. Upon putting it on the ground i inserted the tip of my knife into the rabbits jugular, effectively cutting its throat. Blood began to come out of its throat and it twitched. It kept on twitching so i broke its neck. This effectively killed the animal. Now after reading this you all may think i am a horrible monster, intent on torturing small animals. This i can assure you is not the case. First of all the events described before took place in a time frame of about a minute and a half. And my sole intent during the whole ordeal was to end the rabbits suffering. An animal suffering is probably the most horrible thing that i can think of and i did what i had to do to stop its suffering. Also i would like to stat that my one and only reason for killing the rabbit is to eat it. I would never ever kill an animal for its skin or for a gaudy statue. So i hope that after reading this you may understand what i experienced. Also this was my first time killing anything larger than a misquito so if i did anything wrong it was from being ill-experienced and i apologize.   I know the the previous entry is long but i wanted to portray the experience that i had the best i could. Onto the rest of the day. After i left my house i meet kevin, sarah, and morgan in Grants parking lot. I got into kevins car and sat in the back with morgan. We didnt speak almost the whole way to crystal lake. I first have to say that i was really tired after mowing my lawn and probably wasnt in the greatest of conversing moods. We got to crystal lake and sarah got her ball for her ring and we went over to The Players Bench where sarah played a guitar that she wants and where kevin planned on buying a symbol. I listened to both of them play, sarah on the guitar and kevin on the electric drum set. Kevin bought his symbols and we left for kaliedascoops (i dont think thats how you spell it but ehh). Morgan and i started to joke around with each other while there and i loosened up a little bit. We walked around afterward with our ice cream and ended up at the metra station. I layed down on a picnic table bench and kevin sat on the other side. Sarah and morgan walked over to the train and came over to the table. Sarah bounced on my stomach with her ass. It didnt hurt that much but was pretty funny. The odd thing about this was that i really didnt think about it as being sexual. Usually i would but not then, not sure why. anyway sarah and morgan went back over to the players bench. Kevin and i didnt really want to go back in but ended up waiting outside for them. I went inside and got them and told them that kevin and i wanted to leave. They didnt seem too happy about this and i went outside and then kevin went in and got them. It was something that either sarah or morgan said that kind of put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. Kevin said to either sarah or morgan, im not sure which, "lets go, this place is no fun for ryan" and one of them said "fine let him go home". Now usually this wouldnt mean much to me and i would brush it off but for some reason it hit me pretty hard. It's like that feeling that what you thought was a good friendship, doesnt mean anything. After that we went to home depot and kevin got a hot dog. While there morgan tried to get me to cheer saying i was in a bad mood. Which she was totally right in. So all and all the mixture of being tired from working and somewhat pissed made to be an interesting last few hours. Well thats about it. The day was im sure a lot worse because the whole time i had what i was going to do about morgan on my mind. anyway i know im bitching but i try not to do it to much in the real world so this is i guess what you could call a way of venting. Also if any of the parties featured in this or any of my logs read them, dont take anything i say in the wrong way. If you have a problem with something i say ask my about it and i will explain myself and will maybe repent. well thats all i gotta say so here you go, a quote "It's better to of loved then lost, then to have never of loved at all."   P.S.- Im not going to proof read all this because its too damn long, so if its fucked up. Well, shit happens.

      Yesterday Kevin, Sarah, and I slept over at Erics again and had a good time. The only problem that i had was that i was pretty tired and couldnt keep up with some of the conversation at the end of the night. But for the most part i was all there. We got to erics at about 10:30 and i soon went swimming in his pool because it was pretty hot out and theres nothing better than i nice cold pool at 11 o'clock at night. well we ended up upstairs lying around erics room. Someone came up with this game of whenever you think of something that is sexually explicit you have to put your hand out and someone hits it. That was pretty fun and is actually still going on. Anyway we meet up with one of sarahs friends Kevin. He has the same name as the other guy who was with us. well we went to dino's and before i even meet kevin i had a picture in my head of him being short, pale, and very punkish. To my suprise i got a 6'3"+ dude with a thick beard and in no way looking like a punk. we got to talking and it ended up that kevin likes metal like i do and he seems to be a pretty cool dude. After dino's we said goodnight to "tall Kevin" and went back to erics. also at dinos a cop walked in who had given eric a ticket and knew who he was. Eric being the only one of us who is 18 and doesnt have to worry about curfew, a bit of concern arose among the sarah, kevin, and i. the cop eventually left right before we did and nothing happened. we went back to erics and layed around erics room until we fell asleep. also i came to the realization that night. Well first of all let me start from the beginning. Theres a friend of sarahs named morgan who i like and it would seem from what sarah has told me she likes me also. We went to a movie together, have hung out quite a bit, and we seem to enjoy spending time together, at least i do. But there is what seems to be a problem to me. She doesnt seem to want a boyfriend while i would like to be hers. So i have no idea what to do. ive been contemplating in my head over and over again what i should do but have not been able to come up with any answers. i will most likely do what i always do and just go up to her and ask her what she wants and will hope for the best. But i dont think the best is going to be what im going to get. You know the funny thing about this part of the letter is that i really dont like people who bitch unless theyre my best friends, so i guess tonight im playing the hypocrite. Im going to leave this post with "Whats a man supposed to do when he doesnt know where he's going?"

      Last week was pretty cool. Kevin, Sarah, Eric, and I all hung out on wednesday i think. Anyway we started off at McDonalds where we went inside and Eric bought some food. The only really funny thing i can remember about inside MD is that some little kid went running past our table coming out of the bathroom and Eric says "Where are you goin" and the kid just kept runin. It was funny at the time take my word for it, like "SEARS!!!!". After that we went outside where Kevin shot spit wads at some ducks and i tried to feed one my shoe, he wasn't interested. Then we left and went to Kevins where they jammed and i listened. I tried playing the drums and the bass, but as usual sucked. Then we went to Erics house and played some ATV game for playstation 2. Then we went Dinos and some cool waitress served us. We left a good tip and left, we then went back to Erics for the night. Originally Sarah was going to have me drive her home at 12 or somewhere around there but that planned kinda fell apart mainly because i was to tired and would probably crash and kill somebody. We went swimming in erics pool which kicked ass because it was fucking hot out. Then we talked on erics neighbors patio (its vacant) till about 1 or 2 in the morning. Part of the conversation included religion and our feelings on it. During the conversation Kevin brought up a good point and that is that he thinks i have no respect for religion. This is somewhat true. What i mean is that i dont like religion for the main reason that i think it gives false hopes and is an easy explination for the world around us. Now if religion is the only way that someone can get through the day than i say knock yourself out and believe in whatever you want. Buy i gotta say for me religion is no go. After that talk i decided that i wanted to go swimming again and so did kevin. But i kinda said screw it to the shorts and free balled it. Kevin didnt like it that much so i put some shorts on and we swam for a little while. After that we went up stairs to bed. There was only one mattress so kevin took the mattress and sarah, eric, and i slept on the floor. Sarah originally had the mattress but she got kicked off, which ended up being pretty funny because it's funny to hear her whine sometimes. We all talked until about 4 in the morning or so and then fell asleep. I drove sarah and kevin home in the morning and then went home. All and all a good day. Words of wisdom "When your dick itches see a doctor fast".

      This is my first Blog Posting so i hope i dont say anything stupid or incriminating. I just got back from camping today. I got to the camp at around 6:30 p.m. or so. I went by myself because Becky had to go to soccer practice and i didnt want to go so i drove up early. When i got there i found to my surprise that the god damned gates where locked, so i got out and knocked on the caretakers door but no one was there so i called joe and he got pretty pissed off. So with no other options i put my car in four wheel drive and drove over some railroad ties and around the gate. Well in the end we ended up trying a phone number on the gate and were able to get a key. The number didnt work when i tried it. Later on friday i got bored sitting around the cabin so because it had been raining all day the trails in the camp were fun as shit to drive in so i drove on the camp for 15 or 20 minutes. Did that about 3 times throughout the trip. But i think i fucked myself over because now it sounds like i need a new water pump, because there is this loud whinning noise coming out of the engine and it didnt do that before i screwed around on the trail. So theres about 50 bucks down the drain if i can put it in myself. If i cant its more like a 200-300 dollar fix. Lets get off this, to damn boring. This week and last week have been okay but Morgan is in Florida and i wasnt able to talk to her except for on saturday. Shes supposed to get back today at 12. She was gonna call me today but i didnt get a message. But then im probably not the first person on her list to call. Also i found out that i dont need brakes. See for the longest damn time ive thought ive needed new brakes because they squeel whenever i use them, but this weekend i found out they are some kind of Forever Brakes and squeel when you use them.  Well thats all im going to write for this entry. So im going to end with, half of the people on earth are dicks so we might as well fuck.
