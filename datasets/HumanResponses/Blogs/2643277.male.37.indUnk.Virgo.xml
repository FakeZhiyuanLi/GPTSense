      Well, we're just about set to close out the month of July.&nbsp; This last month has just flown by.&nbsp; Before long, my children will be back in school and another fall season will be upon us.   I thought I'd give you a quick write-up on the convention I mentioned in my last post.&nbsp; It was held in Kansas City, Missouri this year and was very, very good.&nbsp; I enjoy visiting with friends and other ministers while I'm there.&nbsp; You can share new ideas and discuss trends with others.&nbsp; It's certainly different ministering in different parts of the country.&nbsp;   I also am able to enjoy the various ministers that are brought in to deliver the messages each night of the convention during worship.&nbsp; This year, we had pastors from Missouri, Arkansas, Alabama, Florida and Virginia on the docket.&nbsp; It's quite interesting to hear their thoughts on what we need to be doing not only as a denomination but as Christians also.   One thing is for certain.&nbsp; We need to be about the Father's business of working in His field.&nbsp; The theme of our convention was "Harvest Time".&nbsp; It certainly is that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I left refreshed and ready for the coming fall season.

      It’s time once again for my annual trip to our denomination’s national convention.&nbsp; Each year, the  urlLink National Association of Free Will Baptists  meet to conduct business, offer ongoing training in various areas and to share and praise God’s goodness to us over the past 12 months.  &nbsp;  It’s great to see old friends and make new ones each year.&nbsp; I’m always excited to look at what various companies are offering to help us in reaching the lost and ministering to their needs.&nbsp; I really enjoy our time of worship though.&nbsp; Hearing from some of our ministers who I never get to see otherwise and being challenged through their messages is what I look forward to the most.&nbsp;&nbsp; The convention is a time when we can all share what the Lord is doing through us in the work of ministry.&nbsp; I think of when Barnabas and Paul returned to Antioch after having been sent to share the gospel and the wonderful news they shared…  &nbsp;   Acts 14:27&nbsp; (ESV) And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.   &nbsp;  Dr. Luke tells us how God had performed miracles through Barnabas and Paul’s faithful commitment to the work they had been called to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; It challenges me to remember to work hard but always keep God at the front of what we’re doing.&nbsp; Without this key element, nothing will happen.&nbsp; When we begin to see the hand of God moving and the unthinkable achieved, we can only bow down and thank God for what he’s doing through broken vessels like ourselves.&nbsp; When these stories are shared in gatherings like our national convention, it only serves to strengthen our faith and galvanize our spirit.&nbsp; I’m looking forward to what God has for me in the coming week.&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ll let you know about it when I return.

      As I sit at my computer, I'm thinking about recent conversations I've had this past week or so about music styles in a worship celebration. (I don't like to use to the term "service".  I've always thought of the term "service" as a verb.  Something we can do for someone.  In its church usage as a "noun", a service has always sounded like something somber and stoic, like a funeral service.) When we gather together for worship, it should be a celebration of what the Lord has done for us and continues to do through us to reach others for His kingdom.  Everything we do during that time should allow us to celebrate the victory we have as a child of God.  Music is important in this.  And music styles are quite important.  The atmosphere we construct in our celebration is one that is either going to bring someone closer to Christ or it isn’t.  Atmosphere is controlled by several factors, the music simply being one of them.  There are many other things to consider, but that’s another blog post for another time.  As I discussed this issue with my contemporaries, I came to realize how badly the scales are tipped in music’s favor in regards to the total worship experience.  I looked up worship in the original Webster’s dictionary and here’s what I found:  “Chiefly and eminently, the act of paying divine honors to the Supreme Being; or the reverence and homage paid to him in religious exercises, consisting in adoration, confession, prayer, thanksgiving and the like.”  Another definition in the same entry said this:  “To perform acts of adoration.”  I found these to be quite interesting and refreshing.  So much of what is packaged as “worship” is nothing more than entertainment.  That is not to discredit the strength of music and the power it can have in preparing a heart to hear from God.  I want the very best praise and worship songs presented in as professional a manner as I possibly can so as to reach the unchurched that need to hear about Jesus and his love for them.  But that cannot be my obsession and for many, even Christians, it unfortunately is.  Worship is so much more.  When people complain about this church or that church or especially the music at one place or another, I often ask them about their personal relationship with Christ.  How are they growing?  How are they worshipping God these days?  Are they beginning to worship God through “adoration, confession, prayer, and thanksgiving” like our definition says?  Are they performing “acts of adoration” for others to show the light of Christ to people?  This kind of worship truly takes the focus off of ourselves and puts it on Christ as we serve others.  Many of those I’ve asked these questions to look at me like I’m from Mars.  “Isn’t that what the church is supposed to do?”  To this I ask the follow up question, “You are the church so you tell me?”  If the church is supposed to do these things, then we are really indicting ourselves if we are not doing them.  Note I said “many” and not “all” in my assessment.  Some see the point that’s being made and understand that it’s in loving Christ and loving others that true worship begins.  As we grow in the areas of prayer, confession and thanksgiving, our hearts begin to beat like Christ’s and worship of the almighty is taking place daily, regardless of the song we sing.  When we’re properly attuned to Jesus, we’re better able to “celebrate” when we gather for our public worship as a family of believers.   If there’s no private worship though, the exercise becomes meaningless.  In John 4, Jesus addressed this concern with the woman of Samaria…   John 4:23-24 (ESV) But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."    We must do all we can to construct and prepare as professional a presentation of music as is possible to reach the unchurched of this world who have yet to put their faith in Christ.   More important however, is the teaching of the real meaning and practice of worship.  As the church, this is our responsibility.  May God give us the wisdom to do so.

      It's interesting to note how little time the majority of Christians spend reading and studying God's word.  Our bible study group is spending time this month examining statistics to that effect and also learning how the bible speaks to us in a myriad of different ways.  I think our society has become such a visual one that spending time reading is almost becoming obsolete.  One of my great pleasures is reading books.  It's a wonderful way to relax, glean new insights, and reflect on our feelings regarding the things we read about.  Why do we feel like we do?  What background do we have that makes us feel the way we do?  Have we ever considered a different way of thinking?  Are we fair in our assessment of a view different from ours?  These are all valid questions.  When it comes to the Bible, we are called to a "transformation" in our way of thinking..   Romans 12:2 (MsgB)       Don't become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking. Instead, fix your attention on God. You'll be changed from the inside out. Readily recognize what he wants from you, and quickly respond to it. Unlike the culture around you, always dragging you down to its level of immaturity, God brings the best out of you, develops well-formed maturity in you.    I think too often in an effort to accomodate folks in our church, we sidestep the habit of daily bible reading so as not to put "too much" on someone.   How can we be "changed from the inside out" if we don't spend time learning the mind of God and reading what He has to say to us?  Surely with the proliferation of gadgets like PDA's, Apple Ipods and MP3 players, God's word is more accessible than ever before.  You can download the Bible in just about any language and translation and "tune in" while walking, biking or even if you're stuck in that long traffic jam.  It's all really just a matter of priority.  If you love something or someone, you'll go out of your way to please them.  Do we love God and His Word?  The answer to that question is clearly seen in the eyes of the unchurched folks that God puts in our path day by day.  If we really want to have peace and contentment in our daily walk with Christ, we have to spend time with Him.  There are no other options.  I pray you do that today!

      Welcome to my BLOG. A blog is simply short for WEBLOG or an online journal of sorts. Most of you that know me know I have a love for writing and journaling my thoughts so a BLOG seemed like the next logical step for me!  I've designed this BLOG to share thoughts with you about the church plant I'm pastoring in Denver, Colorado and the culture we minister in. Across the country we're seeing a large increase in spiritual searching from the unchurched but it's not necessarily Christ these folks are looking for; at least not yet. As the church we must be ever looking for new ways to reach out and share the true love of Christ, the true gospel, to these individuals.  Along the way, I've found others who share their random thoughts on Christianity on a WEBLOG. Some of the best I've found (at least in my opinion) are posted here. The great thing about these WEBLOGS is that you may not always agree with everything that's written but they make you think, and that's always a good thing. I hope some of what I write here will have value to someone. Drop me a line sometime and say hello!
