      Today, I've just edited the Blog Template by adding a special little assembled graphic next to the title...plus links.  Looks like I found a new diversion.  It took me an entire afternoon to do this but the picture just wasn't  sticking,  until I read Blogger's Help Section much later.  I guess my  New Drawing  will just have to wait and sit.

      I've started with a drawing of a famous TV Celebrity this morning.  I thought it was going to be a breeze with this one, but I was wrong.  I'm trying to take my time in making the face a  real  work of art with the hopes of not exacerbating my chronic back pain in the process.  The best one so far.  But we'll have to see how it turns out.  I've just spent a total of 1 hour and 38 mins. just for the fleshtones and an eye.  In the meantime, I think I'll be hitting the SPA.

      Just testing my new blog look.  Nothing doing.  No new drawings yet either.  Perhaps later this evening, I'll start with something I've set aside.  Nope.  Looks like editing the template is harder than I thought.

      Where was I?  Oh yeah,  my website or my artsite.  Actually,  Webcapage's first four pages including AdVentures Another has been put up for quite some time now.  It was originally created using Netscape Composer's very easy to use (web design) interface, hence my nostalgic partiality to Netscape written on different parts of my website.  The original site can still be seen on  urlLink Geocities .  That was back in 1997,  when Murphy Brown was still on the air and the only show I was truly watching on Friday nights and the whole week on TV, now that I think of it.  Maybe this explains why I put Candice's picture on my AdVentures homepage.  So I'm really just another fan, one of the gazillions out there.    Not wanting to make the website just another fansite or even  just  a tribute to a Hollywood Star,  I had to think of a way to put my artistic abilities to the fore plus make use of my Art Tablet.  It was a simultaneous effort...not being employed and just hanging around the house most of the time and toying with my Compaq Presario CDS520 486DX2 machine.  Ergo, the creation of Art by Ado...a very experimental but fun-at-the-time attempt at drawing on the tablet.    Then AdVentures Another came about to show my interest on the other aspect of the word adventure...the so-called  place where no man has gone before  which I felt was just important  an undertaking as inserting coloring paper-book cutouts and meticulously tracing cartoon characters on my Wacom (tablet).  For sure, although I think quite a few has really bothered to see my  urlLink another  page, there had to be a venue for my insights into technology, space and the Sciences.  Since I've never really ventured into the subject,  perhaps having enough webspace will give me the opportunity to write on it in the future.  And I'm well aware the future is now.  The only thing that's lacking is an actual experience on "Space Exploration" or any exploration beyond my Windows Desktop.   Just as it is the nature of space to behave at times quiet and vast,  I took an AWOL from furthering my little website project and visited and revised it on different occasions.  Until February of the year 2004 where, by this time,  I had more gadgets and gizmos that I can really handle.  I bought a Palm m505 in late 2001 and although I loved it and am still using my m515 today,  I impulsively bought an iPaq just a couple of months later in 2002 thinking it promised more drawing capabilities which it did: since its screen was comparatively brighter and bigger.  Little did I know that the Palm model I bought was going to be replaced by a brighter m515 precisely because of the primer's issue of poor backlight/frontlight.  Suddenly,  with two PDA's of opposing OSes at my disposal,  I felt empowered by the romantic technology of the stylus pen touching a lighted glass surface,  which is pretty much the same as drawing trace images on a lightbox...only more handy and way too cool.  Incidentally, drawing, although I'm resolved at the idea of it being the main purpose of buying all these high-tech wonders, was not the only thing I did on  them PDA's .  I tweaked and I played and I listened and with much satisfaction.  I was totally in love with these guys.  Until Philippine Summer of 2003 came along.  This was when I first saw and immediately (although not instantaneously) surrendered all my dollar time deposit for my Wonder of Hi-Tech Wonders...my Viewsonic V1100 Tablet PC.    After one or two weeks of carrying the Viewsonic with me wherever I go, whenever I can, however I can muster;  I barely touch my TPC nowadays except of course when I'm drawing.  This device, I believe, is the best I've seen, bought, and used for drawing, drawing, and drawing.  I just couldn't stress it enough.  Of course without mentioning the software I use,  I love to draw on my Tablet PC...and people like looking at them.  At least two elderly people gave me a unanimous thumbs up!  Where am I headed after all this musings about my high-tech devices, you say?  To Art by Ado 2 of course --- three galleries built from these very devices I've just promoted.  That's the other AdVentures concept I had in mind anyway.  The first  urlLink AdVentures Website  was based on Multi-Level Marketing when it was still in vogue.  And who knows?  Maybe Advertising and Marketing is the way to go.

      Ah. Now I think I'm beginning to know what "blogging" is. It's mostly about hogging your dearly paid Website with stories of your own. At least this is the case for me...since I neither have flash animation nor an iota of CGI & Perl embedded in my website. At least for now. So I'm blogging instead. With a tinge of vengeance, no less.  Let me start on April Fool's day. For the record, which this blog will eventually be, just another record...I have officially signed up for Web Services to host the adorinareyes.com domain name which was registered on March 30, 2004. Since I'm getting all formal about it, let me continue by saying I'm doing it mostly to hang my drawings for all cyberworld to see. So far, I have no idea who's looking nor do I care. I do it mostly for me and I get comfort in the fact that I am my own critic. And probably the worst, if that makes any sense.  Right now, I'm all fired up I've encountered that old writer's block.  Having mentioned that, we're back in track.  But I'll come back later after I watch the poignant Finals between Coria and Roddick.  Maybe then I'll be able to have a swing at this blogging thing, probably even an  ace.

      Come see my drawings I did on my Palm m505.  Although I've upgraded to an m515 now because they were selling it at a discounted rate and I still had accessories for that model that I felt never got the chance to be used and "broken in".  Here's the site  urlLink Art by Ado 2 Too  which you can blog to your own. Feel free to surf my newly built website. Of course, there are other drawings too.  But the Palm m505 was my introduction into gadgets and mobility that I truly adore until now and I'm so happy a lot of people are very satisfied with their Palms (referring to the Palm Addicts blogsite).  urlLink Daily Palm, views & rants updated multiple times a day    What's happening here?  Can I only blog to my site?  I thought I was blogging this to Palm Addicts.

      Hello again, quiet world. Do you like drawing, like I do?  Then please visit my site at  urlLink Adorina Reyes Screensaver Drawings  and download free drawings for the DrawingHand Screensaver.  I was prompted to put up my own website specifically for that ongoing project that I have. Besides, it feels like it's time I had one spending most of my time on the computer.   I hope you support the efforts of the Program's creator and Artist Jeff Newman at  urlLink www.drawinghand.com . I know he gives us users ie, good support.  You register for a one time fee at his website and you'll be granted an endless collection of drawings from many artists from all over the world which includes me and  you  if you're into drawing as well.  I'm neither from Europe nor America yet I'm "with" these artists who love to see their works of art magically recreated on their computer screens. I'm from Manila if you're interested in knowing, the very icon used for those explorer  folders .  Anyway,  you can always take a look at  urlLink Art by Ado 2  for some sample drawings created with Jeff Newman's Art Studio program,  same one I used to make the screensaver drawings. They're called E-mail Art.  As it is the case, they're absolutely FREE to view and download.

      Hello. Welcome to Ado Blogs!  This is my first shot at blogging.  Honestly, I've never blogged on any site before I put up my own.  Hope to see people who wish to post their comments on drawings on my site and Art and Computers in general. Personal topics and those that divulge in religion and politics are definitely headed for deletion.  C'est la vie!

      I've been wanting to create a "signature logo" for the Screensaver Drawings Set for quite some time now. Today, I've finally made a new logo from my old signature as it was originally intended. Oddly enough, by rearranging the elements, I made it even resemble the tiny default image place holder graphic you see whenever a "graphic" or picture is waiting to be downloaded.

      Lately, I've been doing some remodeling of my entire website since I felt it badly needed a  new look  that's more in tune with the 21st century.  Remember it was originally created in 1997.  Besides, I'm equipped with an HTML editor with features I'm only beginning to unravel.  So I've been to the forums "or fora if you're Latin" and asked for some advise regarding what I should do  to add more dynamism  for a rather largely-allocated webspace which I'm hardly utilizing.  How I was received was close to being fodder in the lion's den, not that I don't take criticism too well...especially the constructive kind. I welcome them with an open mind as a matter of fact.  To site an example, I can't seem to readily forget a comment such as "some retarded flash movie embedded in an HTML document" referring to my Splashpage --- which, from the thread's conversation, indicated that the little flash animation I used for adorinareyes.com was in fact NOT showing up on most browsers.  So I've been prompted to remove the flash animation and decided on pure unadulterated white text on a black background for it to be more accessible especially to Mozilla users.  Later on, I'd like to turn it back into something  flash-like  but until I find someone or some good program to do it for me, my "simple text splashpage" will have to stay and ferment.    Next, I was struck by the comment on "streamlining the look" because my website looks kind of like a hodge-podge of unrelated events.  Since my running idea was and still is  Webcapage , this means I can literally do whatever I like with every page (in terms of design and approach) although I believed his point with "making my website more useable" pretty much hit home.   The result was uniforming the layout and navigation buttons on all pages except the Screensavers Set which is autonomous as it is.  So this is what you see for now --- no more animated gifs looping in an endless cycle in AdVentures although quite frankly, I miss my little sha-k!  Colored text remains as it was created back in 1997.  Minor improvements all in all in terms of layout and design.  As egotistical as it may sound, Rome after all...wasn't built in a day.

      In an age of seamless Photoshop Editing, the fundamentals of Drawing is sadly overlooked.   I've often pondered on my art that looks like a coloring book extravaganza against a backdrop of the photoshop-savvy websites the internet is saturated with.  Instead of mulling over its obvious faults and rather crude presentation especially to the Gen-X'ers, I've decided to share some Excerpts from Daniel Grant's article in American Artist's premiere issue on Drawing [Fall 2003 issue] which would otherwise be unavailable on the Net. It's entitled: "It all begins with drawing"  He starts by saying, "Experts agree that drawing is fundamental to exploring ideas, developing skills and perceptions, establishing procedures, and evaluating progress.  That's true no matter how old or experienced an artist may be.  Recent years have shown an increase in the number of artists developing their ability to draw through college and community courses, informal gatherings, instructional books and videos, and interactive computer drawings.  The consensus among the instructors is that people have once again recognized that drawing is fundamental to any visual expression, no matter what the ultimate medium or style."   There are the Beginners and there are the Advanced Practitioners and I think I fall somewhere in between.    He goes on by saying, "Drawing can seem positively archaic to those immersed in the contemporary art world, with its fixation on theoretical models, installations, new media and free form expression. 'A whole generation of artists has grown up without the rigorous training in drawing that characterized the experience of other artists,' says Stephen Farthing, the executive director of the New York Academy of Art in NYC, 'and it hasn't seem to have held them back in their careers, but it depends on the media they work in.'  Chaet concludes that drawing isn't just a technical skill that helps artists visually describe what is in front of them but a life-transforming, even philosophical, experience.  'Drawing helps you to see the world, to measure it, to understand your place in it and how things fit together,' he says."  I hope we learn something from this article defending the pursuit of drawing and its inherent merits.  That's it for now.  I hope to draw more or at least see me practice some more.  Although my drawings are free for the taking, maybe I can sell one for $104M one day.  Nothing wrong with a  pipe dream .

Of course by now,  my model (the Viewsonic V1100 Slate-type) is already outmoded and isn't featured here.  Still, looking at these demos remind me of what one can do with a Tablet and how gorgeous these pieces of technology are.

       urlLink    I remember when I was just starting to create a webpage for my Screensaver Drawings or  page5.html  of my Geocities website.  This was how it looked back when I had the chequered flag background aptly named  finishingline  on---as if I was racing against time and myself.  The analogy being I am indeed a  quick draw .  Today, since I've split the page into  4 Sets  to accomodate more artworks, I couldn't get a glimpse of all my drawings all at once so I've turned this partictular webpage snapshot into my current desktop wallpaper.  That's all.  Sometimes, when I feel overwhelmed by all the empty boxes I have to fill with new drawings, I like looking back to a time when it was  all done and finished .  Ado

        I've noticed myself wanting to take long breaks.  Breaks from drawing, painting or any artistic/creative endeavor is the norm for me which means that after I've accomplished one for a relatively short period of time, there's a lull from following it up with another which is not really good.  That period of sitting it out and waiting for the next big project eats at me.  Sometimes, it even plunges me into immobility and that uncomfortable state of creative  oblivion .  So I have to constantly remind myself of the last "good one" I've done.  After all, it isn't everyday that you can create one nor is it in my  style  to do so. Today, I'd like to feature my Back in Action drawing. It not only represents my comeback from a long hiatus from drawing on my computer using DrawingHand's Art Studio.  It also serves as a constant reminder that I'm truly back in action with my artworks that deserve to be shared in the web community...or not.  I simply want to be back in the "work fray" is what I'm truly saying.  The best I can promise myself is to take shorter breaks and fill all the empty boxes of my Screensaver Drawings Sets.  Once I've done that with works that are worth my while, then I can say to myself  Well Done!  and then  Do some more  in the nearest possible future without waiting another two, five or even ten years.

       urlLink     This is a picture of Andre, my 7-year old (in human years) Dalmatian dog. He's definitely pure bred but is currently obese and lacking in social attention which makes him kind of like a wild, untamed and irritable pet. So I take him for a walk outside our white gates. Little did I know how heavy he's become from leading such a sedentary life and that he'd be able to pull me by the leash and not the other way 'round which is what the leash is for.&nbsp; At least, he refrains from jumping all over me and practically mauling me in the process --- as of late.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm using my "drawinghand" for holding the retractable leash as my other hand goes flailing by. We don't walk. We run. So far, no accidents yet but the activity both&nbsp;leaves us  wagging our tongues . Why am I telling you this? Since I am overweight&nbsp;too and&nbsp;probably need the exercise as much as Andre does, my "drawinghand" gets all the beating from being pulled so much. So, my drawings will have to&nbsp;take the backseat for now, ie until I accustom myself&nbsp;in doing this for 21 days, the length of time it takes to  make a habit  of something...or so the bit of trivia goes.&nbsp; Personally, I think he'd make a good "drawing subject" too --- once he's all ready for&nbsp;his  proverbial  close-up.

I haven't seen the movie Shrek 2 yet but it only took one look into this cat's eyes to convince me to draw him in a memorable kind of way. Besides, my drawings mostly aren't about the movies themselves but the subject matter at hand, which in my case are a collection of wallpapers/pictures compiled over the years. So without knowing the context from which this picture was taken in the movie,&nbsp;I'll have to take this one at face value as should you.&nbsp; He kind of looks like a smaller version of Hobbes, DYT?

This is my personal take on the movie --- Volumes 1 & 2 and I loved them both.  In fact, I feel I could even relate to the  blood-splattered bride  in all her progressive stages of single-minded revenge.  I'm not saying that I actually want to kill somebody.  I just like the idea of self-justified girl-power shown in its most pure, unadulterated form and unbridled glory.  I hope you also like my new drawing of Uma as the "bride with a vendetta" not to mention her Hattori Hanzo made samurai sword.  Note: I'm not particularly fond of watching violent movies for all its blood, gore and inane appeal but I take exception on this one.  Kill Bill Vol. 2: Now Showing in Philippine theaters.

       urlLink Fixing Your Web Site   I found this link courtesy of a Lockergnome newsletter on Website Creation and since I'm always on the lookout for ways to keep my website in top shape or at least easily accessible to many, I found it interesting that after using the Optiview Site Check, it found 56  bloated images  in my website for the first 10 pages. There could be more.&nbsp; I immediately corrected this by optimizing all the images for Web viewing and so, you might notice a slight improvement in download times for all the graphics even over a 28.8kbps dial-up connection. Since my site is an  art site  or at least I would like to think so, it relies heavily on pictures and this&nbsp;becomes an issue that's very important to me. For those who are creating their own website, you might find this link interesting and useful. Incidentally this site is maintained by the guy who wrote  Webpages that Suck - Examples of Bad Webpage Design . Knowing how much effort I put in constantly improving mine, I hope my site isn't one of them.

      A new Tablet PC drawing entry. Please visit  urlLink Art by Ado 2 .  I started this one on the TPC several months ago or perhaps even a year ago and finished it tonight with the Wacom Tablet on my Desktop.  Right now, it looks like it  needs  a little more finishing but I like it the way it is and will probably come back to it later.  It's a beanbag doll based on one of Anne Geddes' specialized photography of babies in various  scenarios  and costumes.    There seems to be a little snafu with the Mozilla Firefox browser not being able to display the thumbnail pictures rollover correctly but this shouldn't be a problem with MSIE.  After all, this was done using a Frontpage feature. You can always e-mail me for some drawing suggestions.  I'm running out of  dolls as still life  to draw and I need to add some more to my Tablet PC art roster.  I'm just worried how the page will look in Mozilla after adding some more thumbnails that keep overflowing over the given table's width.  Talk about Frontpage  bugabees!

       urlLink    My 19" Viewsonic Monitor is back from the repair shop after 2 weeks of being tweaked for minor problems and I missed it so much, I don't turn it off and keep watching "drawings" done by other artists of the Drawinghand Screensaver to give it a  test run . If you notice, I've switched my keyboard with my tablet which I had difficulty using while it was in the keyboard drawer where the keyboard should really be. Maybe next week, if I successfully purchase a new Wacom Graphire tablet, I'll have a  new  configuration once more.  Ado

       urlLink    Just in case you haven't browsed over  urlLink Set 4  of my Screensavers Drawings, the wide-eyed cat a.k.a. Puss in Boots from Shrek 2 is finished. By this time, I still haven't seen the movie nor have I formed an exercise habit but at least I'm still able to draw despite my previous apprehensions about the  leash-pulling  affecting my  drawinghand's  performance as well as using this  sinister  cat as subject.
