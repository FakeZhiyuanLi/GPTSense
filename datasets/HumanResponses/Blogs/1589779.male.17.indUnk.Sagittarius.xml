      k..so today i woke up quite late..arnd 6.40.."studied" till quite late last night. hehe. i was looking outta my window, staring at the expressway. went to school, got caught for not tucking in my shirt..pls l0r, can't blame me, i was too engrossed in my notes. anyway, yup had 2 papers today. chem n chinese. i'm so dead for ch3m. stupid teachers threw in so many red0x questions. lololol. n the questions kept asking for oxidation numbers? dammit la. din know how to do. so left most of em blank. maybe except for the (no. of moles of xxx chemical = mass/mr) part. perhaps i could get 1 or 2 markz. lol. HAHAHA. at least i think i can get 10 full marks for last ques. cos its all on atomic structure. hurhur. my fav topic~ :D the rest fail liao la.  yeah, then had break which was supposed to be 1hr 15 mins, but ended up being 30 mins. wth. ate lor mai kai n some shit curry potato bread. then chiong to hall for chinese. HAHAHA. chinese was surprisingly easy~ with the exception of the compre tho. damn philosophical. shud be able to do well la. but the whole thing was  PURE  torture. the chair was like shit, so hard, really strained my back. and there was some idiot tapping the floor. damn irritating. felt like juz telling him to farking hell stop it or i'll grind my pencil thru his damned shoe. hurhur. nonetheless, i finished my paper in 2 hrs, spent the last one sleeping. :) couldn't really sleep also, damn stuffy. lousy hall.  yeah, after both papers, went to l0t1 to meet alv(angry m4n) n jy. ;) sat down in mac for a while, then went to buy a billab0ng shirt. kaoz..damn small. XL lor.  shit. then alv bought this quite c00l sleeveless billab0ng shirt. @%^^$&& oh well, i think i'll buy the nike one. hehhe. yeah..then went home, changed and went to l0t1 again. to study econs with alv n eileen. st0ned in macs for god knows how long, then eileen left and alv said "aiya fuck la, i dun feel like studying liaoz". so i said "okay" and we both went to the arcade. he played drums, then we played virtual cop 3. lol. damn c00l. :D then went home. argh, damn tired. tmr paper at 12. heng arh. but i'm not sure if i've gotta go for the flag raising. sighz. well, tmr will be a better day! :)

        urlLink       urlLink   A GOLD Dragon Lies Beneath!    I took the  urlLink Inner Dragon online quiz  and found out I am a Gold Dragon on the inside. My Inner Dragon is the most honorable of all. Golds are the third rarest of all the dragons (after Platinum and Chromatic dragons) and have a station in society that reflects their rarity. I am what one might call a Draconic Knight. Golds live by a strict code of chivalry and commitment. Remember Draco? Yep, Gold Dragon. My appearance is fearsome and all-mighty but I'd never stoop so low as to bring any harm to a human. I'm one of only two dragon types that are aligned "Lawful Good" and demonstrate great magical proficiency. My piety, beauty, wisdom, and inner strengrth are absolutely without parallel.    Of course, being a Gold  Dragon isn't all high ethics and codes. I like to fly around scaring things, advise humans in their affairs, and shapeshift. Strike that, I  LOVE  to shapeshift. And I'm great at it. In fact, who's to say I'm not really a Gold Dragon after all? My favorable attributes are honor, truth, kindness, gold, wisdom, bravery, and trustworthiness. If anyone threatens or tries to kill me, I could strike back with my breath weapon - Fire. But then, no one's tried anything that stupid in the last couple thousand years. After all, I'm about 54 feet long.

      Have you ever had a feeling that such that all u wanted to do was just to love a person wholeheartedly? such a simple thing, yet sprouts so many problems. from my own point of view, me being nice to someone doesn't mean i want her to give me back anything, afterall, love IS sacrifice. yupz..frankly speaking,  i tried giving her up. maybe cos of advice frm other pple? i don't know. yet i can't. i know i'm the sentimental type. some people say its a blessing, i think its a curse. sighz, other guys just forget and move on. and they find better people. i wish i could do that easily though..

        You represent... playfulness. Playfulness can often be mistaken for sluttiness or flirtiness... Flirting is something you enjoy doing, but you're mostly just about having fun. You're into partying, and it's seems that people enjoy your company as much as you enjoy their's.    urlLink   What feeling do you represent?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    hahah..i think that really suits me! :D well, at least its better than being angsty! tEehEe.

      Have u ever felt that at one point in your life, all you wanted was to spend quality time with ur loved one? Just holding hands, and just walking slowly down a long long stretch of road..there's no need for any talking..for both sides already understand each other? Right now, if i could have one wish..I would just wish to walk with her down a never ending stretch of road..quiet, yet serenaded by the sound of crickets chirping. Simple isn't it? Yet it isn't so easy. Sometimes, simple things are the hardest to come by. I don't know how to make you trust me..I've tried to shun her, leave her alone and not talk to her. But yet..i can still see that u're uncomfortable. I really don't know how. You know what kinda person i am, and i mean EVEN IF i like someone, i'e always put faithfulness above like. And you know that. I really miss you, i really do.

      ....... today was quite an okay day la...nothing much happening. sianz..juz had my dinner..feel damn sleepy..yawnz..  anyway, i had Pe for first period today..got orientation. yup, ORIENTATION. dunno for what fark. all we had to do was run arnd the whole sch, looking for checkpoints. total of 12. then some pple damn knn lor..i found the damned clue, and then they juz come n leech. Conversation as follows.  Me : "eh guys i found the clue liaoz, its over here"  Gary : "wah eh pple they found the clue! lets go see!"  Me : *frowns*  damn lame l0r..blooder leechers. then when they got the clue, some guy called kee chern ran like a fag lor. cos he saw angela running also, then he did some martial arts move, more commonly known as Qing Gong. wah, then run damn fast, even faster then angie, altho she was a sprinter. so pro siaz..nex time can take part in olympics.  oh well, ya then i was damn pissed off. cos of idiots like that in my class. but nvm la..at least the pe teacher was nice. he was a njc canoeist, which means that he'll be the new teacher in charge of canoeing too. that makes 4 teachers now. i juz like his face, cos he has these really small eyes, which make him look shy..aww.. i think i'll go make friends with him, then can slack durin pe. hehehe...anyway he let us off early so after pe was recess, i went to buy chicken rice. then i left it on the table, and went to talk to classmates. then my seniors shouted something which sounded like " fish! got bird eatin ur rice!" .. so i turned and saw the DAMNED bird pecking at a piece of chicken on my rice. dammit. then the auntie who was cleaning tables came and scolded me...i think cos she thot i fed the bird or sumthin. basket. who would wanna feed a bloody mynah.   then the rest of the day was quite okay la..getting back results n stuff..of which i failed like every subj. dun ask me why..i juz failed..cos i din touch my notes? gaahaha..i think i'm still sleeping..lol..and i'm lazy to wake up..sighz.  yeah then after sch hung out at bpp with angie and ben. went to kfc to eat the snack pack thingy. but they din have banditto. only had what crispy strips. so i bought that. not bad la..juz that its the extended version of popcorn chicken. oh ya, i realised popcorn chicken goes damn well with cheese too. :) ya..then walked arnd. then went home. basically i juz haf no life.   oh well, something good happened today tho. Me and 3 other pple frm the canoeing team got nominated for LTC ( leadership trng course). heheh..damn excited..lookin forward to it..:D cos dun hafta go to sch~! and the programmes seem quite nice too..got 20km land ex, half day kayaking, abseiling, all the usual OBS stuff. but ya..i'm looking forward to meetin new pple. i sure hope they're normal..i mean..they have to be..or they wun be future capts ya? hurhur..yeah..hope got chiobu also... :P  sometimes you tell urself u've found the perfect girl, and u're over the moon. then after a while, both sides break up, and u realise that the girl which u've been lookin for has always been before ur very eyes. someone which u'll commit to, and share ur life with.   isn't it funny, that we, being humans, always go for things which we will never get, or which other pple might not approve of? is it the thrill, the challenge, or the feeling of rebelliousness? whatever pple tell us not to do, we do it. why? lol. how funny. one word of advice : always cherish the people arnd u, for u might one day fall in love with em. :)

      talking to her now..:) cos someone no more sms wor..k. juz finished talking to her. kinda irritated. dunno why. but i seriously need pple to comment on this. the conversation went like that.   me: okay so tmr i'll go to some corner of lot 1 to study by myself until u wanna eat dinner k?(cos she said i'll distract her) her:huh..but like that u'll be so alone. me:i'm okay la..i dun mind studying by myself. her:den nvm la..we'll meet on thurs then. me:but i told u its alrite. her:dun wan la..so waste time for u.  fine. so the problem is i'll be wasting time "trying" to study. what nonsense? i'm wasting time studying? k la..i know i've not been studying and whenever i try to study i end up talking nonsense. but i'll be alone, and what's more the god damned promos are comin. i might be jokin about getting retained. but who in his bloody right mind would get retained anyhow?   oh well. nvm. had another interesting conversation today, or rather, "confrontation". it went like this. Frank:*pushes roy* and said "ni3 hun4 na2 li3?" roy: huh? i dun understand. me:he means, "u zhup where?" roy: *gives me blur look* peter: oh, he means, "where do u fool around?"  HAHA. lol. might lose out some of the effect. better if said in person. heh.  argh. shall go do my work now. at least it'll douse my "irritance".

      lets see. today was a rather fine day. nothing much happened. but on my way home, a scene of children playing hide and seek under my block made me think back on my childhood days. when i was young, i was really carefree and boy was my life good. i've not experienced stress when i was young. in pri sch, all i did was sit in class and talk, yet i still get band 1s. yup, then after sch, i would go to my child care centre, where i would stay till my mum picked me up. i loved my friends there. everytime we had outdoor time, we would play catching.."boys catch girls" or "girls catch boys", or hide and seek. come to think of it, playing catching was free, yet exciting. unlike now, i've gotta pay to be excited. lol. i really miss those days, where everyday in my life was juz to look forward to playing catching.  :) right now, if u were to go around asking pple " hey u wanna play catching under my block?" all they would say is "u siao ar?" or "so childish. grow up la". yup, that is what most pple would say. but for me, i'm game for anything. i'm a childish boy at heart actually. yeah..and i still watch cartoons every sat and sun mornings. lol. okay..gtg now..:) ciao~

      okay lets see. today has been a really dead day. i stayed at home the whole day, trying to finish up my chem hw. darn. juz realised that i've got one whole shit load to do..sigh. :( oh well, the impt thing now is not to dwell on it, but to get it over and done with. hmm, to all couples out there. i've got a phrase for u guys. "Love is a gift, not an obligation". If u ask me, i would say that normally, most couples quarrel and break up, mainly due to them thinking that their partner should change for them. but no, that's not the case. both should change for each other, and if possible, one should take one step back. if someone loves you, take it as a life long gift, always feel grateful, never take it for granted that that gift will be with u all the time. :) yup, and   ben  ..relax la bro. why the heck are u fretting about girls? if they come, they come. u'll find the special one in ur life, ahha..like me..took me 9 months. but it was worth it in the end. the longer u wait, the better ones u'll get. why get someone now, and regret it when someone better comes along? take things in ur stride, and cheer up. cos life's more than just girls. :)

      hmm, been coming home late quite often these few days..so could only blog today..haha..but this shall be a special post..just for yesterday. =) mm..yesterday, the whole day was quite boring, went to lot 1 to play pool with alv first, then went home to sleep for a while, before going to chinese gardens to see the hello kitty exhibition. yup yup, 5 of us went,me, ,jh, liz, angie and jamie. the whole thing was quite nice..enjoyable in fact, to be able to see all those wonderful lanterns with her. :) haha..we paid 12 bucks, and walked for like say..2 hrs plus, then we all had to go home. i saw her home as usual, but on that night, i did something really different. something that i did for the first time. yup, feels great. even tho it was only for like 10, 15 mins, i really enjoyed every moment of it. if i had a choice, i would want it to last forever. :) sometimes she calls me stupid, and silly..but i dun mind being silly and stupid, if it makes u happy. :) if i were to say something now, i'd say "i really want u by my side all the time". and i mean it. =) heh. gotta go..mum's comin home soon. :P

      haha..changed my blog layout and colours, lets just say that the colour is to suit my taste, and the lil cute kittens are to suit hers. :) lalala. had a REALLY MONOTONOUS day. wasted my whole afternoon rotting in food court and macs. shan't comment bout it. damn irritating. had to go home with kee chern summore. kee chern, if u're ever gonna turn on a comp, go online, and come to my blog, i juz wanna tell u that u're a really boring person filled with dry humour, amen. i've always wanted someone frm my class to live near me so we could go home together. apparently, i'd rather he not exist. sigh. juz finished watching s'pore brainiest kid. lol. althea had to look the most decent of em all man. too bad she din get into the last round. bah. stupid goldfish desiree got in tho. i've gotta say that she's got this really interesting way of answering questions. quite alike a tortoise. she kinda sticks her head out whenever  she says something. damn irritating. bah. and there was a luo han fish lookalike also. HAHAHAH. HAHAHAH. k. i juz saw the president's star charity commercial. it shows tay ping hui and sharon au with 2 spastic kids asking pple to help those kids realise their dreams, their hopes, and whatever. i don't wanna sound mean, but can i ask what aspirations or any REALISTIC dreams could they ever have? i don't think they even know the meaning of dreams. its quite pathetic come to think of it, that they juz live their entire lives being spoonfed and being incapable of doing anything on their own. plus with fanatically and blindly loyal muslims running around blowing things up, what more can the world ask for? speaking of mats, i juz 2 mat kids throwing stones at a poor kitten at the park downstairs my block. since i was just looking down from my 15th floor window, i couldn't do anything. but seriously, i swear that if i was down there, and if i see them doing that, i'll literally whack em. i dun give a damn if their mat minah mum is nearby. FUCK THOSE BLOODY MAT KIDS. i'm not a racist wannabe juz because i do not like their face or skin colour, but because of what they do. if even they themselves do not respect themselves, how could they expect us to respect them in return? i'm not referring to the malay population in general. juz some pathetic malays who give pple like me the wrong impression. everywhere i go, i see malays cutting queues, littering, abusing animals, hugging and kissing each other in public. seriously, what got into allah's mind when he decided to create such a pathetic race? lol. i juz wanna laugh.

      oh cool. suddenly i remember the pword to my blog. it juz popped into my head juz now. lol. :) oh alright..i've been feeling lazy..so like damn long nv blog..hehe. right. so i'm bloggin now! eh..k shall start frm today.   Today, i went to sch for some sat workshop. lol. what an extreme waste of time. wanted to zhao..but oh well, stayed thru the end. haha..but i learnt how to inteprete analogies wor. so cool. yup. then, went out with the vball guys. all i can say is, u guys are one cool bunch man! all of em damn on & damn sporting, hard to find this kinda pple in pj now if u ask me. wish the canoeing pple were a like that..sigh. haha..yeah anyway, we went to cdans, and played 40 mins of lq. (Buy 30 mins get 10 mins free) hehe..free advert. :D heheh. and then the fun began man. a total of 10 pple went. Lets see, me, frank, angela, hong yi, su-ne-ne, carol, daniel, cindy, gavin and regine(another canoeist. my vice capt.). Yup, so for the first round me frank angela hongyi and regine were on one team. Yup, and after that experience, i realised that LQ is a REALLY merciless game. Want examples? heh. eg1. Cindy and carol kinda cornered themselves, so frank hongyi and me were kinda ganging them. then frank suddenly had his gun hit cindy's eye or sumthin. and she was like "wah lao u hit me! so pain!" however, no one stopped to care for her. the 3 of us were just like laughing maniacally and still continued shooting at both of em. Afterall, free frags are what they are, right? :) the same happened to gavin when he tripped and fell, and when some other pple fell too. haha. they're juz really damn "xia4 jian4" :D oh well, i got 1st for 1st round. dun ask abt 2nd round. we changed the girls in the team. so now cindy and carol were in our team. hahaha..then got this part which i found damn funny. Carol was like being cornered by 3 guys, and at that time i juz about ran past her. she saw me, and screamed for my help. I looked at her, looked at her 3 assailants, and all i said was "BYebYE". then i ran away. LOL. left her there to be "raped". I realised i shud nt have done that..cos it lead to the other team winning. And stupid toylet and regine were like insane lunatics, all the gun snatching etc. plus gavin and su-ne-ne were covering their chest pad. so how to shoot em?! lol. but it was damn fun, damn exhilarating. hohoh. shud do that again! :D   oh well, damn tired now. shan't go to sch tmr. shall go swim or sumthing. hahah..i think this hols is so gonna be wasted man..lol..RETAIN-ACY here i come! :D

      mm..been kinda "muggin" the whole day...haha..and i've gotta admit that i'm kinda rusty at it after 4 yrs of not muggin. :) sigh..i wanna pass my promos..but i dun wanna juz scrape thru..i want to understand every single concept and formula. otherwise, when i get to j2, i'll juz die la. everyone's saying "aiya, juz promote first. nex yr then can buck up." haha..to that, i'll juz give em this ..|.. bloody hell, u expect me to cram 2 yrs of work together? i mean like, science is not sumthin u can juz look at it and say "oh i understand". rather, the impt thing is to know how to apply it. very frequently, in exams, the examiners juz hafta twist the question arnd and taa-daa. u won't know how to do it. so my point is that the basics have to be strong before moving on. everyone's afraid of retaining. and so i ask them "what's there to be afraid of?" because u'll waste one yr? because people will laugh at u for being stupid? or because u juz want face? frankly speaking, i dun give a shit about all those things. tchs has taught me a lot of things, because i literally advanced my way thru. i dun see the point of advancing to j2 when ur basics can juz be toppled with the flick of a finger. ultimately, the A levels are what counts. haha..maybe the common stereotype of retainees is that they're "dropouts", they're lousy students, they're losers of the sch. if u think that way, well, fuck you. i think they deserve some respect at least. just because u get good results, top the class or become the teacher's pet, doesn't mean u're god or sumthin. well, if u're muggin, u work hard, naturally u get good results. so be it. respect those who don't. hahaha..because u'll never know when its ur turn. :) ah well. the above post was juz to de-stress. no targets in mind. :) yup, back to my work.

        I am  Mario .   I like to jump around, and would lead a fairly serene and aimless existence if it weren't for my friends always getting into trouble. I love to help out, even when it puts me at risk. I seem to make friends with people who just can't stay out of trouble.

      juz received her xmas present. might be late..but oh well..better late then never..right now..i juz feel forgotten. looking back on all my posts now. i juz feel that its wishful thinking on my part. i'm juz so bloody naive. yeah. naive. cos i still watch bloody cartoons. but that's besides the point. right now, i feel that the situation, is juz "i love you, but u don't love me no more". yeah, and i juz cant help but feel depressed. all over again. because i seriously do not know how u feel towards me now. good or bad. i dun wanna know anymore. i juz don't. its juz so hard to be a "friend" to u all over again. its so hard, its bloody torture. i read ur blog, and i agree with what jolene said. u said u were afraid of ur parents knowing. maybe they knew? or maybe they didn't, but perhaps they would juz nod and say "i'm happy for u" when they knew u had a boyfriend? nothing happened at all. and u chose to give it all up. as for studies, A levels might be coming, for u at least. and u were afraid u couldn't concentrate. that was ur problem, which was mine too. aren't couples supposed to solve each other's problems together? u might say "i'm afraid of becoming a burden to u". u know jolly well that i wouldn't mind, in fact i'd be happy to shoulder ur problems with u. but no, u chose to give it up. u chose the easy way out. by juz going to the root of all problems and eliminating it. which was me. but if u'd ask me "why would u still wait for me even when i already broke up with u?" i'd reply "because i believe its something worth waiting for. i love you."

      some people say "fish, u're an idiot. u've already broken up with her, why do u still care about her so much?" or "since u've already broken up, why do u hope that she might be free so that u can ask her out?  are u that desperate?" my answer: no, i'm not an idiot. i'm no despo either. perhaps i'm seriously sentimental. perhaps i'm nuts. but there's one thing i'm sure. that is, i love her. i loved her before, i loved her after. and i loved her still. it breaks my heart whenever i talk to her now. its like going back to square 1. like as if we didn't know each other. like as if we were strangers. its so hard to talk, so hard to express anything. i know i haven't been a perfect guy for u either. always playing gunbound, neglecting u, being insensitive at times, and most of the time, its u who takes the initiative. i know now. but i might never have the chance to make up for it now. if u ask me what do i have to offer you, i can tell u only two things. my love, and my loyalty. people might ask, what loyalty? i can tell them, or rather list out all the shit i went thru. if they can tell me, "yes i will still stay by her side after everything, and still love her as much as i did before, no matter what kinda crap happened.", then ok, they're good. u mean a whole damn lot to me. i know its fsking mushy and lame whatsoever. but if u ask me, that's all i can come up with. i'm not some prime minister or muhamud ghandi who can come up with strong words to move people. but all of it, all that i've typed above, comes frm my heart. the bottom of it.

      wow. something great juz happened. i smsed my teammate to ask what time's trng tmr and where to meet. and his reply was "there's no trng tmr.sorry for not informing u". WTF. "SORRY FOR NOT INFORMING U". IF I DIDN"T FUCKING SMS HIM, the following stuff would have happened.   1.waking up at bloody 6am to get ready. 2. having a lousy breakfast which consists of plain bread with butter. 3. taking 1 hr to get the kallang 4. going there to find nobody. 5. swearing my guts out. 6 taking 1 hr to get back.  all in all, that's my whole morning wasted. IF i didn't sms him. cool eh? praise allah.

      haha. today was a really short day. ended at 1. then had to chiong down to lido to watch "the last samurai", which was at 1.40pm. well, as usual ben was bullshitting. cos there wasn't any 1.40 show. lol. so we bought tix for 2.45 instead. had kfc, then talked nonsense for a while. then jamie told me she was watching at 3.45pm lar..and "she" was watching too lor..bah..wanted to wait till then so as to watch with her..but aiya..can't pangseh ben n scandal boy..so yeah..can't refund my tix either. heh. so yup, went ahead to watch. hmmm, gotta say that its one awesome movie. i really admire their spirit and courage. very often, its usually the going against of one's own morals and principles, and also fighting a battle which they know they would lose, not with cowardice, but the very act of pushing till the end, that sparks respect for the characters in the movie from the audience. it might be cliche, but hell yeah i love this kinda scenes. juz like lotr. hmm, but i liked the ninjas better tho. haha..they look kewler. :D

        You are one of the few out there whose wings are truly  ANGELIC . Selfless, powerful, and divine, you are one blessed with a certain cosmic grace. You are unequalled in peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of Light your wings are massive and a soft white or silver. Countless feathers grace them and radiate the light within you for all the world to see. You are a defender, protector, and caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver of the wrong, chances are you are taken advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often. But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in everyone and so this mistreatment does not make you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will try to help misguided souls find themselves and peace. However not all Angelics allow themselves to be gotten the better of - the Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting for the sake of Justice and protection of those less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever change - the world needs more people like you.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    haha. what an angel i am. =D juz had my dinner. went for trng juz now. sian..trained in the damn rain. luckily i had a cap on. lol. garh. what else. i'm drinking qoo orange blast now. tired like hell. gonna sleep soon i suppose..wahah..zz

      heh. today was a really slackish day. stayed at home for the whole day, save going to lot 1 to have my lunch. juz had my dinner. but i only ate a lil. dunno why i felt damn full. so i only ate the dishes and threw the rice away. heh. how boring. haha. i can still recall, 1 year ago, at this very day, the O lvls came out too. cant see why everyone's so worried about their results. maybe the diff is when u put in effort and when u did not. yeah for me i juz strolled to sch, took my result slip, opened it, and say, "oh myes." lol i thot i would get over 20 for not studying lar. then i'll be the first chinese high dude to get more than 20. hehehe. but oh well i didn't. hmm. so lets see now. gunbound biatch got 15, shanna got 16, shujun got 10 and zhiwei got 14. hmm. not too shabby. i think they all did alright. ahha esp zhiwei, who sounded really happy. both gunbound biatch and shanna were kinda disgruntled about their results, xb with english, shanna with erm, i aint sure either. and shujun sounded sad too because her friends around her were feeling disappointed. hmm, u cant be happy abt ur results when the others around u are not. i guess that's why she's feeling down. well, here's a shoutout to u guys. no matter what u get, no matter where u'll be going next, Life's a road we all gonna take. We've crossed paths once, and have bonded together quite well. Let it stay that way, while u make new friends in the place u're gonna go next. no matter whether u got 14, 15 or 16, take pride and tell urself u've done ur best. no worries. Life still rocks. and yeah, please remember the fishie in pjc always yeah? haha..i'll miss u guys. Peace out. =)

      juz finished playing gunbound. hehe. break i guess. gonna play again later. sekretly. =D hmm. come to think of it. i was wondering what the diff would be if i didn't retain.  IF I DIDN"T RETAIN: I'd be in j2 now slogging on sch work. I'd have no time for leisure stuff.  I'd be still stuck in the same dumb assed nerdy class with only angie and frank to talk to. I'd turn into some pjc guai tai who'd be obessed with A levels.  Overall, No God Damned Stinking Life.   well. how bout if i retained?  I RETAINED: I've got lotsa time for my own stuff. 1 more year in fact. Sch work is still alright. Can still manage. Got a new class, but sadly, still the same. Cos its PJC. Overall, I'm still rotting in PJC.  BUT, fortunately, i made quite a number of NEW BUDS, mainly XB the gunbound biatch, Shanna the Lumberer, Zhiwei the "i seriously don't know what to say abt him", and lastly, Shujun the "Princess Pinkie". Lol. thanks to them, i'm still alive. thanks to them, the first 2 months went past smoothly. thanks guys. u all add colour into my life. rock on. =) keekles2uall. lollerskates.=D

      had quite a boring day. ponned most of the lectures juz to go library and talk crap. yeah that's about all for today. handed her the cross stitch which i've been doing for the past few days today. really glad she liked it. yet i juz read her blog. and she said it wasnt worth it. to me, its worth everything. would u not want to give that someone something as special as her for her birthday or for any other occasion? the money spent, the time i used to make the cross stitch, everything, is worth nothing compared to just knowing that u like it. the thing is, i'm not doing these things just to compel u to return to me. i'm just doing it for your birthday. that's all. no strings attached. yet i don't know why u always feel so stressed whenever i give u something. you know how much i love u, and that's all u've gotta know.

ODAC biatch: Hey fish, made more new friends thruout this campfire? Me: er..nope.. ODAC biatch: oh okay. i give u an apple. so what do u see? Me: i think i heard that before. An apple tree i suppose. ODAC biatch: No no, i see an APPLE GARDEN! Me: oh okay. well, hey my bus is here. gotta run. cya.  WHAT THE FUCK. SERIOUSLY THAT WAS THE ULTIMATE.

      hmm, btw i was trying to find the malay translation of the phrase, "I OWN U UPSIDE DOWN". if i'm not wrong, its "aku own yuo tomabaleh." i couldn't find a translation for "own". that explains how refined the malay language is. guess allah must be stupid too. if one day, some virus were to infect all the chickens, ducks, cows, and everything except dogs and pigs, i wonder how those mats will survive. will they discard their religion, and eat pork? or will they juz die in the name of allah. lol. well, they can always turn to vege for a change. or i'd be glad to recommend them Fatty Weng's Delicious   Kuay Chap  . Try it, cos it OWNS YUO TOMABALEH.

ODAC biatch: well dun be depressed, let u tell u something really inspirational. Me: oh ok. ODAC biatch: ok, i give u an apple, and can u tell me what u see inside the apple? Me: erm..seeds? ODAC biatch: yup, a lot of pple said seeds, but i can tell u my answer. Me: which is? ODAC biatch: I see an APPLE TREE within the apple. Me: *thinks* right. ok. ODAC biatch: yup so u see, that's the moral of the story. everyone has potential. Me: yeah whatever. and he went yakkity yak yak yakkity yak yak all the damned way to the busstop. really lar. i was condemned to listening to his nonsense. sigh..pj. fully fits my description of guai tai sch.  lol. ok. damn i wanna play Q-bert now. never fails to crack me up juz by suiciding the lil fella, or by touching a monster and watch him spout gibberish.

      WOO WHEE. I FOUND A WAY TO TRIX THE TRIX GURU. IT INVOLVES STUFFING TISSUE INTO THE HOLE WHICH THE LOCK IS SUPPOSED TO FIT IN. SUCH THAT THE LOCKED EFFECT IS THERE, BUT ALL I HAVE TO DO, IS PUSH HARDER AGAINST THE DOOR, AND VOILA THE DOOR OPENS. HURHUR. IF I PULL THIS OFF, THE STUPID DOOR SHALL HINDER ME NO MORE. WOO HOO. TRIXMASTA ROX YUO AND PWNS j00. ok anyway, today me, ben and jamie went to palms gardens to play bowling. 8 bucks for 2hrs. keke. yeah. not bad lar. i got 125 pinfalls. which is the highest i ever had in my life. so yeah dun laugh. oh btw, we were supposed to play bowling yesterday too, but cheryl had parental probs, and PINKIE conveniently pangsehed us. =P so left ben and jamie, but since the booking of the alley was based on an hourly basis, we din have enough time to get there in time. so decided to chuck the idea. i was kinda irritated cos everyone juz left like that. but woo, it was kinda a blessing in disguise. because today i saw the notice on the board outside the condo admin office. it read " The bowling alley will be closed on 8th and 9th march for reservice and maintenance." keke. so luckily we din go yesterday lar. hurhur.and to pinkie : eh rilak lar im not angry can. i was juz having a headache due to excessive dehydration. :D so cheers. asdfasdfasdf

TRIXXED BY DA TRIXMASTA. :D HURHURHUR. yar lar. there's no other girl in my life now anyhow. all my time is like spent on gb and stuff. how to buaya. not like someone lar. hmm, how bout B _ N ? fill in the blank with a suitable vowel. =) eh yeah today was a great day. nice of cheryl to tag along even tho she didn't know most of the pple, actually she knew only me in fact. lol. oh well. but i thot she was really outgoing and sporty to hang out with a group she doesn't know. mm. nice nice. hurhur before that. i was actually up to some trix. we were standing at the 2nd floor of taka, overlooking the baby fair. xb and jamie were supposed to meet us, so i called them up, and told em that we were in the baby fair and that they shud come and look for us there. HAHAHA. then frm the 2nd floor we could see jamie walking into the baby fair, surrounded by pacifiers, diapers, and baby toys. LOL. DAMN KEEKLISH. xb nearly got trixxed lar. stupid ben had to show his big balloony head. hurhur. anyway, after that we had lunch at bk at cine, then walked arnd aimlessly for a while. xb and ben juz had to give me stupid faces now and then lar. like seriously, there's nothing going on dey. doh. ya then i went home while cheryl, ben and jamie went back to sch for trng. haha. oh well. quite a fun day. i thot it was quite nice to be able to meet up with xb and shanna again. and btw, shanna looks weird in a skirt.

      ahah. the bored dude has come to blog again. alv's away at trng, xb's bathing. no gb kakis. :( hmm. lets see. did nothing much today except go lot 1. turns out that NO ONE msged me. oh well. at least there's sch tmr. but no one will be going anyway. :\ hmm. so many people i know are going away. some going to other jcs, others going to poly. i'll miss em. but on the other hand, i hope the 2nd batch will be better. tho its always not the case. but i can always hope for the better. =) i was thinking this afternoon when i came home, in my quiet room, whether have i come to like this certain girl, or is she just something which i use to fill the void in my heart, or rather a substitute. i've always been serious with this kinda r/ship stuff, and i'm strongly against playing with people's feelings. hurhur. unlike some people i know. whose name COULD start with B and end with N. lol. and i dun walk around looking at girls like most guys do anyhow. but i'm not a fsking gay or something. doh. its just me i guess, and i believe that u don't have to look around to find that special someone, u'll find each other. haha..to most people i know, gb might be the most impt thing in my life now. lol. that's true. but the fact is i've got nothing better to do anyway. but i'd rather go out and socialise then stay at home the whole day (eg. today). bah. nvm. Gb time. =) btw, i'm not gonna say who's the girl. so dun ask. =P

      lol. Has anyone ever wondered what does the word "friend" actually means? to most people, it might mean people whom u treasure, people whom u like to hang out with, etc. in pri schs, the kids even have best friends and such. i used to be like that too. until today when i was sitting in my room thinking, what actually does the word "friend" stand for? to me, its just names of people which i remember so that i can smile at them and call out their name. nothing more. something that u put at the back of ur head once u smile and greet them. how fake are sayings like "a true friend never walks out on you", or whatsoever. the thing is, how do u define true friend? to one person, u might be their "true friend", but on the other hand, u might not be "their" "true friend". its just a matter of perspective. so in other words, the saying cant be correct. perhaps to some people, once they find more entertaining friends, they leave their "old" friends behind, thus contradicting the phrase "friends forever". whoever came up with that seriously takes the whole thing too lightly. in fact, there's no such thing as friends forever. its just a phrase to relieve the so-called pain and suffering when people part. that's it. and if u take my definition of "friend" just being a name to remember, then "friends forever" is legit. because its no problem to remember a name for life. ultimately, u cant depend on ur friends. that's what i've learnt. i''m not biased or anything, but i think its better to depend on urself rather than to seek help frm ur "friends". -shrugs- how ridiculous this god damned world is. i'm so glad i'm in it. to hell with social skills.

Anyways, met alv there, then Cheryl came later. Had the usual tok c0ck ala mat jokes session with the bing. Wanted to buy my billab0ng shirt. But argh dunno why I didnt buy. Juz didnt feel like it I guess. Nvm I shall buy it on thurs or fri. keke. Then I shall wear it with board shorts and look like a true blue hip hop surfer dude. HAHA. Lol today I zhupped canoeing trials. They told me there was a mat who did 3 pull ups, but only 8 push ups. And I mean eight. EIGHT NIAAAA. Actually can tell lar. He looks seriously scrawny. Even pinky can pwn him tombaleh. Plus with her pink shoes as her l337 weapons, the mat WILL be pwned TOMBALEH-LEH. DOUBLE PWNED. DOUBLE BREWED. DOUBLE h4XED. K. dunno wad shit Im saying but Im typing this in Microsoft word now. And that explains "the bing", cos its supposed to be iced milk tea. Yeah juz as my name is  the jin yu . Lol. Hurhur trix trix.

And guess what regent sec is having their sports meet at the sports complex tmr. That means it will be damn crowded. Darn. Hmm, can anyone sponsor me monies? I wanna buy a pair of jeans.

Bored. =( my sms is like under-used can. No one smses me. Except for 11124. go figure. Nvm. I shall apply to wacky sms. Hahez. The gals are so kewt and h0t. lol damn I better stop now.

      hmm. hardly have any time to blog nowadays. but oh well. here i am. to get straight to the point, i'm confused. confused as a mat finding a korner in a circle, confused as an indian looking at himself in the mirror in a dark room. that's right. i'm confused. not about what i'm thinking, but what i should do. its so much like deja vu. and finally i know how she felt last time. because the decision to make on what to do, no matter what, will change everything. its just like telling ur buddy u like her, and all of a sudden, the two of you feel awkward and break off. its just so delicate, the human emotion. i've not felt like this for a few months, its the same feeling i felt almost 1 yr ago, but after being through a relationship before, i can't help but feel a sense of dread. a sense of what might happen if this all goes wrong. i told myself, not to have anymore r/ship committments, mainly because its stressful and i've got no more confidence in this sorta thing. but much as the rational mind works the body, the heart works on its own. and much as i try not to get involved in anything, i still fail to do so. to many people, i'm a gunbound freak. but however, its a sort of means with which i run from reality. ben keeps telling me so and so likes me, that, i don't know, but i do know that as much as i wanna run away, all i want is someone to be here with me. its not that i'm desperate, but who wouldn't want anyone to love? and that's why i'm back to the beginning. i'm confused abt what i should do. if i make the wrong move, i lose a good friend. even if i make the correct move, i really do not think that i would want any committments now. to put it bluntly, i'm afraid i will not be able to keep them. besides, i'm not even sure how she feels. maybe its best to keep it this way, for now.

      haha. life's bland for me nowadays. been gaming most of my time away. talknig to cheryl and jiahui online now. cheryl's telling me abt her sch and friends, jiahui that noob is tinkering with her ipod. heh. ben's getting along better with huiwen now. glad to know that he's feeling better since last saturday. glad to know that after god knows how long he's been trixxing, he's finally found the special someone. heh. and that feeling is way different frm being with other people. i still wanna see if u can still kao pei me abt being too loyal. haha its damn funny when he says this to me. "eh fysh, dun trix huiwen leh. plspls. i beg yuo." HAHAHA. wtf? i'll show u what she said nex tyme lar. u'll laugh. whahha. hm, hols are here. tyme to get my jeans. AT LONG LAST.

      ben's feeling fucked up now. and that's the feeling which i know. i've been there, done that and in fact been through more than him in this aspect. but as much as i know he wanna give up and throw everything away, he cant help it but just hold on. and then sometimes, i think to myself.   You don't love a person because he makes you laugh. You don't love a person because he's handsome. You don't love a person because he's Mr. Popular. You don't love a person because he messsages you "I love you" everynight. Rather,  You love him because You know that he loves you  As much as you love him.  And that's all that matters.

      lol. firstly, i've gotta comment on the narrow minded-ness of people nowadays. u ask someone for the email of another person, and they assume u wanna buaya her, jio her, trix her. whatever. wtf does asking for someone's number/contact = to flirting? that is unless u're that kind lar. but if u're doing it out of sincerity, and just really wanna make new friends. i dun see anything wrong. lol not only that. she refused to give me the email, plus she commented abt one whole shit load of crap. fuck off lah. i dun need u to give me ur crap. stupid acsian shit. pls lar if i'm the kind who goes arnd asking for people's numbers, i wont be me. fucking hell u ask arnd lar. this is the first fucking time i'm asking for someone else's email. and that's because 1. she stays in the choa chu kang area, 2. i see her every morning in my mum's car on my way to school, 3. i've seen her arnd even before she came into pjc, and lastly, i juz wanna fucking make more friends cos pjc is one big fucked up graveyard. plus i've always been devoted to the one person. u've got a problem with that? sue me. "cos the best is fucking yet to be". ah well. i cant be bothered now anyway. i've been asking arnd, which is so not me. makes me seem like i'm so desperate, which i'm not. i'll just take things one step at a time. dun wanna seem like some desperate fool.

      Hmm, i was wondering what my life lacked. And i realised it was adventure. so many months of not canoeing, and i've almost forgotten the feeling of canoeing thru choppy waters with the possiblity of capsizing any second. The thrill, the excitement, was what i joined canoeing for in the 1st place. but i'm outta it due to a shoulder injury. and it sucks. i'm just sitting at home doing nothing and eating a lot. just today, i ate 1 packet of beehoon for breakfast, 1 packet of prawn noodles and 1 packet of carrotcake for lunch, and 1 whole pizza plus garlic bread plus chicken drumlets. waddafuk. ok anyways. i was saying that i lacked adventure and thrills in my life. i wanna try paintball and white water rafting. i want excitement to flow thru me instead of countless physics and mathematical formulas. mm, i'm listening to Red Rain - Summer now. and i just love this phrase. "blue skies and long hot summer days, white sands and surfing in the bays." there's nothing like a warm summer day and me doing some water sports. hmm, or perhaps i can go to new zealand to stay and play with kiwis. i've always loved kiwis. my fav shirt when i was young used to be some new zealand shirt which my uncle bought back. it had a kiwi on it. uber cute.

      ok now i'm gonna address the irritance that has been bugging me since yesterday. if i sound offending, so be it. its all my thoughts and i dun give a flying fuck what u've gotta say. ok yesterday was ben's bdae, and we all went out to have a good time, or at least wanted to. first part of it was ok, went to the stadium, then went on to town to meet huiwen. we were still laughing and joking. went on to play pool, but halfway thru huiwen got a call from some jackass and so she went to some remote area to talk to him. i could tell something was not right, so i went to look for her. asked ben abt it, and he said "dun care lar dun care lar". so ok nvm, i went alone. waited for her to finish talking, then asked her abt it. tried to cheer her up a lil. that's all.  went back to play pool, and i thought "okay maybe everything's alright now". and went to have lunch after playing pool. as we were walking, huiwen was more or less talking to me along the way, and ben was with xb. ok perhaps that made u jealous ben, but what the fuck if u are just gonna keep to urself, dont expect her to come tagging by ur side. everyone prefers someone whom they can talk and laugh to, i'm sure she aint an exception. and there i was just trying to keep her entertained, or would u rather she stone off into the distance? perhaps if u would have joined in, things might warm up between u and her, dont u think? i'm content just to play the fucking middle man. not like i didnt leave u guys to urself. i went into DKNY to look at women's clothing. like how fucking interesting can it get? i just didnt wanna see 2 faces. one's BEN'S "MI SI PWNED" FACE, AND two's HUIWEN'S "HI IMMA GARGOYLE" face.(in case u didnt get it. its the STONED face.) ok nvm. then when we went into the food court, ben and xb happily went to "shop". so obvious they were gonna talk stuff abt me and her. well, fuck off lar. i hate people talking behind my fucking back. but its alright. i tolerated it. i figured xb might be the only one with the clean mind and of neutral standing to talk to ben. but no, when they came back, i felt so fucking like an alien, like a fucking muslim who doesnt believe in Allah. and when xb and i walked outta wisma, he said "i think u shud have a good talk with ben". well, i'm not going to. if by now u still do not understand me, i'm not going to fucking talk to u. what brothers can we be if u have no faith in me. wtf she aint gonna be my next target. pls lar if i were to be ur competitor, i'd have pwned u hands down. trust me. and i suppose u've noticed quite a number of "perhaps" in my blog post? just maybe if u had fulfilled those "perhaps", ur bdae might have been a much more enjoyable one. and here i was trying to make it more lively, but got suspected instead. u guys seriously pissed me off to the living hells, so much so i just went home, ate cup noodles and went to sleep at 9 fucking 30 pm. well ben, i only have 3 pieces of advice for u.   1. Dont be so passive about everything. she's a girl, u're the guy. make ur move. 2. The best way to get someone u like is to just be urself. what's up with all the "stop swearing within 2 weeks" shit. u cant stop swearing, everyone knows that. if she cant accept it, so be it. and jealousy will ONLY cause ur downfall. trust me. i've been there, and i've changed. 3. Dont keep on saying "I DONT CARE I DONT CARE". BECAUSE U DO. TOO MUCH. QUIT DELUDING URSELF. DO SOMETHING TODAY.  ok thats all i've gotta say. at least i've gotten everything off my chest. take it or leave it.

      Dashboard Confessions - Vindicated  Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of it has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing I am captivated  {Chorus} I am Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye  And rendered me  So isoloated, so motivated I am certain now that  {Chorus}  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away (3x) So let me slip against the current So let me slip away (4x)  {Chorus}  Slight hope It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...

      for some reason i woke up at 4.35am. so decided to use the comp. my mind is like so full of thoughts now. so full that its overflowing. how irritating. i shall go for a jog now. perhaps it will open my mind up to other stuffs. =)

      hmm. 12.20 am. and i'm feeling nostalgic again. whenever i look down frm my block, i see an empty park, an isolated playground, a long canal, and a sparse highway. and i cant help but think abt everything that has happened to me thru out the 17 yrs of my life. the people i've met, the stuff i've been through, everything just surfaces at this point of time. hmm, right now, i'd like to climb up some really high place, lie down and look at the night sky and just ponder. huiwen asked me this outta nowhere "is it possible to stay devoted to a person forever?" i dont think anyone knows the answer. its just as impossible to answer as "is it possible to love a person forever?" so much paradoxes, so much ironies in life. yet day by day we ask ourselves the same question over and over again. girls like to ask emselves if relationships will work out. they contemplate day and night abt stuff which is like totally irrelevant to the entire issue. the thing is, how would u know if u dont give it a try? i'm not trying to be sexist or whatsoever. but that's whats happening to most of the guy friends arnd me now. and its irritating to keep on discovering that its the same problem thats bugging them all. kinda funny that its now the guys who get pwned by girls. i wonder why.

      hmm. lotsa stuff have been happening arnd me lately. especially Mr. A, who is frustrated over r/ship problems now. the overall situation was something like this. He got to know some girl in his sch thru her senior. and then started to sms each other and stuff like that, talk on the phone, and then go out on dates. they got quite close, and kinda had feelings for each other. but one day, the girl says " i've been thinking alot lately and i think we're just better off as friends." naturally, Mr A would be disappointed and depressed. If u were Mr.A, how would u react? if i were Mr.A, naturally i'd be devastated, depressed, and feeling emotionally drained. its the feeling of "after everything and all the feelings i've put in, is this what i get in return?" furthermore, i'll feel cheated and being led on. i'll wanna juz tell her to fuck off and die u stupid biatch. even when she smses, i'd feel reluctant to reply. on the contary, i'd be REALLY happy if she smsed me last time. but, can u actually do that to the one whom u have feelings for? are u able to risk it all, destroy all the bridges which the 2 of u have built thru time, with "fuck off"? i dont think so. in addition, not only will u be missing her a lot, u'll be sorta "desperate". but seriously, i dont think she's leading u on. also, i dun think she would want to see u like that too. i just think she's being rational. that she puts a lot of thought into considering. it just shows that she takes it seriously. i dont think she's taking u for granted. trust me. she still likes u. but i'm sure she has her own reasons. well, u've got 2 choices. one is to juz fuck it, or one is to wait. u decide. the 2nd outcome will be like mine. but hey, as long as u know that what u're waiting is worth waiting for, then why not? its the human emotion which makes us homo sapiens different frm animals. :)

      Everywhere i go, i keep getting shit frm Christianity. Just yesterday, i got this pamphlet that had these words on the front. "PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS". lol. wassup. christianity going into reverse psycho now? i flipped it open, read it a lil. the gist was like, if u do not do this, this will happen to u, and that people now only use God in swear words. its&nbsp;kinda like, if u do not believe in God, u will go to hell. and the way they put it is really subtle. this is what i interpreted. "Hey (reader)! God is great! God can salvage your soul, IF u believe in Him! but if u dont, its alright! just that u'll go to Hell only. :)" how fucking pseudo. some assclown gave it to me at the Orchard Mrt station. I read it in the Mrt. I swore. I got out&nbsp;at Newton. I threw it away&nbsp;with disgust. Sorry lar but i see no point in joining a religion which coerces other people to join em. Oh, did I mention&nbsp;I was Anti-Christ? Guess so. -shrugs-&nbsp;

      saw this on someone's bloggah. "like there was this one on what love is, and it says that love stems from a very long friendship, when you know each other so well, you could complete each other's sentence before the other finishes, you know exactly what's going on in each other's minds, and that you've accepted their faults. you don't have doubts of the other person when you're really in love" how very true. my sentiments exactly.

This is not some kind of joke You’re just a kid You weren’t ready for what you did  And when the world is on its knees with me its fine And when I come to the rescue I do it for you time after time Everybody seems to be getting what they need with mine ‘Cause you what I need so very but im anything but ordinary  I think im trying to save the world from you You’ve been saving me too We could just stay in and save each other  Im anything but ordinary (ordinary) Im anything but ordinary (ordinary)  hurhur. this song ROX j00.

      hmm. why do people always feel depressed over emotional matters? in order for a relationship to kinda materialise, its gotta start with 2 people liking each other in the 1st place. but, very often, its only either one sided, there's some other guy/guys, or both sides are confused.  i shall touch on one sided-ness first. One sided-ness happens when A likes B, but B isnt really attracted to A. so therefore its only A feeling for B, but not B feeling for A. Therefore, things get quite difficult for B, who has to put up with all the sickeningly sweet stuffs that A does for her. Not that she doesnt appreciate it, but its awkward. And naturally B would feel guilty, as she's sort of "leading" A on. B could tell A that she doesnt like him, but A would most probably say, "i will wait for u." and stuff like that. personally, i'm not sure if things would work out between A and B. but what i think is, just try to drop subtle hints to put him off, or if things get worse, just tell him its impossible. its hard not to consider his feelings when telling him the truth, but at least u will prevent him from being more depressed in the end. but as for IRRITATINGLY persistant people, just tell them, to Fuck off. =) Ok next, the problem of the other guy/guys(or girl/girls). Everyone is bound to have people whom they have loved and liked before. Some forget easily, others find it lingering within them all the time. what i think is, if the person u like is constantly thinking abt her old flame, give her some time. approach her in a different manner, try to make her laugh, and play with her. if circumstance is good, have a good talk with her. find out more abt the other guy. BUT DO NOT PROBE. find out what she likes abt the other guy, and that will give u an advantage. share her problems, and share her joy. very soon, if nothing goes wrong, tadaa. =) (ps: Jealously is ABUNDANT in this kinda situation, so one thing to master is to curb ur jealousy NO MATTER WHAT) Ok last part. the situation where both sides are confused abt each other's feelings. very often, that is just brought abt by insecurity and lack of communication. how do u like someone seriously if u dont even know what he's tryng to say? and miscommunication always ruins things. 2 people cant possibly go out on a date and smile at each other for the whole day. sure. u might like him, u might want to make an impression. but trust me, guys or girls relate better to more active or playful people. so for a start, treat him as a friend. when u find that u can talk to him EVEN WITHOUT THINKING ABT WHAT TO SAY NEXT, then u know u can take the next step. one thing to note, whoever ur partner is, he should not only be ur boy/girlfriend, he should be ur soulmate, ur bestest best friend, and someone whom u have no qualms sharing ur problems with. =) hurhur. i think maybe next time i can be 1x marriage consultant. KEKEKEKE.  (to anyone who read this: i hope this helped. :) )

      You are Blue Monkey, who is always smiling and are extremely cheerful.  That is your selling point.  If you can keep your cheerfulness, you would be able to lead a good life.  You have a big heart and are person of broad mind.  You are also very curious, and therefore can not leave still something that you don't know.  You tend to barge into almost everything.  You are a great researcher, and want to master one thing thoroughly. You are hard worker, and have a persistence to finish what you have started no matter what.  Nevertheless, the wish to quickly make ideals come true makes you impatient, and may lead to unpredictable failures. You tend to have sharp temper and are little bit too self confident.  And if this character comes out, it could lead to resentment.  But don't try to fear failures. If you follow the road, you won't have to experience failures, and you will definitely be able to gain success. You are good at making judgment on situations.  Your strength when it comes to a showdown is fantastic. Dedication and efforts towards work is extremely strong.  You bring up results constantly.  Although you care about the others, you have a narrow range of acquaintance, and therefore may be suited as a specialist or a researcher.

      This is an excerpt frm one of my msn logs. :)  Hope is the waking dream. says: for me, i'm gonna wish em the best Hope is the waking dream. says: and i think ben's sharing the same feeling Hope is the waking dream. says: if ben can go up to her and say Hope is the waking dream. says: "hey if alv can make u happy, so be it. I wish u guys the best." Hope is the waking dream. says: what will huiwen think? Hope is the waking dream. says: being magnanimous earns u respect Hope is the waking dream. says: i'm sure she will respect him for that Hope is the waking dream. says: even all the bystanders Hope is the waking dream. says: will respect ben Hope is the waking dream. says: when ben swears and rants at them Hope is the waking dream. says: he gets nothing at all Hope is the waking dream. says: people think he's just plain jealous Hope is the waking dream. says: but when he wishes them the best Hope is the waking dream. says: they cant really say anything, and would also respect him. Hope is the waking dream. says: therefore he in fact, has won something from nothing Hope is the waking dream. says: and also learnt how to let go at times. Hope is the waking dream. says: i think thats the most impt lesson people have to learn.  So there you have it. The thought of the day. Sometimes being magnanimous will let u see the light after the storm. Don't think of it as a painful experience, think of it as enlightenment. :)

      Sometimes in life, we care too much. And it spoils the broth. I guess this is what's happening now. You know, I can just imagine ben's pain and anguish, huiwen's frustration, and since alv's her bf, I think he must be feeling pretty screwed up too. Question is, how did this whole thing end up like that? Very often, the unpredictable happens. And it not only affects the three of them, but also the people around them. I happen to be connected to all three of em. And right now, i guess I can't help but feel sorry. Yet, there's this feeling which I cannot describe. When Alv told me he was together with huiwen, I felt something. Something which I could not figure out even after thinking for the correct word for several hours. The fact that I'm sort of like a brother to both Alv and Ben doesnt make things easier. Personally, I dont think its anyone's fault. And I wont side with anyone. I just think this whole event was really sudden, so I only hope it'll settle down after a while. Ben's reaction was really expected, to me at least. If his blog is his outlet, let it be. If you'd ask me, one year down the road when Ben reads that blog entry again, he'll not be swearing, but smiling to himself. This is what I do now when I look back on my previous blog entries. This is part of life. So therefore what I am trying to say is, Ben's just feeling really cheated. But I'm not saying anyone cheated him. Just the feeling. So that's why he's ranting and swearing in his blog. Well, I'd have him do that than cut himself or, would you rather he call u up and swear in ur ear at 3am in the morning? So please, cut this dude some slack. He deserves some after all he's been through. After all, we all grow from our own experiences. As for Alv and huiwen, I'd have to say that its kinda awkward for me to talk to u guys now. Alv might have noticed that I was quieter when we walked to sunshine place recently. Huiwen, hang in there if you believe alv's the one for you. You're a great girl, and I like ur personality, but sometimes you go into things too rashly and end up hurting people, so the bottomline is just care about the things which you deem important for now, and set ur priorities right. I think ur life will be better if you have something to live for. :)  Ben, i hope u'll pull urself together like a real man and be magnanimous. People will respect you. And Alv & huiwen, I wish u guys all the best, and I hope after this whole thing has settled, we can all hang out together like buddies again. Peace out. :)

      while walking in lot 1, there's this poster frm breadtalk saying "You have your flaws, i have mine."  Come to think of it, I'm Flawed. You're Flawed. Everyone's Flawed. Who isn't?  But then again, Everyone's Flawed in their own unique way. The World itself is Flawed. And that is why, For Flawed people like us, The World's a perfect place for us to live in. :)
