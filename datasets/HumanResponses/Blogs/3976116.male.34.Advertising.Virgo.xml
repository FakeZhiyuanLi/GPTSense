						     So Brad called the other day...  I could start every blog that way, couldn't I?  Let me just say that he is the strangest person I know. Most people have that thing in their brain that keeps them from saying certain things. Not Brad. So when I said, "I was bored at work. I didn't have anything to do," he says without hesitation, "damn, me too! I should have called you so we could beat off together."  Um... what?!  Brad gets the quote of the day, too: "You are dead to me now. Lucky for you, I'm into necrophilia."

						   Congratulations to everyone who guessed Phil. It was indeed Phil that said those things. He said he wanted to do those things to Brad. Of course, I'm not surprised by anything Phil says. Once we were in a crowded mall and he asked, "if we were gay, would you date me?" I said, "no." So he started saying, loudly, "you wouldn't date me? why not? I'm a nice guy! Come on! Say you'll date me!" All the teenage girls looked at us funny as I ran out of that store.   It's no wonder I'm not in therapy. I'm starting to think that, despite his black fingernails, almost peeing on Brad's bookcase, and never unpacking his apartment the whole time he lived here, Pete is my only normal friend.   Oh yes, TJ? I looked it up and those things don't have official names. The staples.com site only calls them "brass fasteners." Sorry I couldn't help more. I asked the girl who sits beside me, but when I said, "spreading the legs apart" and I giggled, she  walked away.

						   OK, see if you can guess who I was talking to:  First he said he wanted to drain someone's nut sack, replace the balls with machinacal balls, and make it where they shot hot sauce instead of sperm. Then he suggested that it be Krispy Kreme icing so I would enjoy it more. And so that person could "ice my buns."   When I threatened to post this information, he in turn threatened treatened to pin my eyes open and make me watch reruns of Night Rider while he "made sweet man love" to me.  OK, so which one of my friends was I talking to?

						     Ok, something I wrote over on SWD got me thinking... are ALL famous serial killers white people? I mean, there's Jeffery Dahmer, John W. Gacy, Son of Sam, the UT Tower sniper, Charles Manson, Jim Jones, and that chick from the movie Monster... they're all white people. The Columbine killers? White boys. The guy that drove his truck into the Luby's and shot people? White guy.   What's wrong with white people? Or, what's wrong with minorities? How come they don't fester like this? Minorities get mad, they just shoot you right there. I can only think of a couple of Hispanic serial killers. The one guy here in Texas that would ride the train and kill people in towns along the tracks... and a guy in California a while back, who killed white girls. But we don't usually keep freezers full of heads or have boy bodies buried under their house.   I'm just saying.

						       What? I am! No, really, I am. No, it's true. I'm serious. Stop laughing. No, really, stop laughing. You're making me angry. I'm trying to be serious here. I'm just an innocent... Dude, if you don't stop laughing, I'm going to hurt you. What I'm trying to say is that me being innocent is... OK, that's it. You don't know how hard it is to be innocent... not that kind of hard, you dirty bastard. See! That's what I'm talking about. NO! I don't want to put it in my mouth! DUDE! Stop making those gagging noises. Why do you always have to make things so dirty? NO! I don't want to touch it! Stop being queer! Dude, stop touching me like that! I'm so going to kick your ass! KICK, NOT LICK! And NO I don't want you to hunch my leg! You are so gay! No, YOU'RE gay, not me, so I'm not playing this game. NO, I'm not playing with your "thang" either. That's it, screw you, I'm going home...

						   . Well, I've been saying it would be really easy to do, and I guess I was right. Someone came into the agency last Friday and stole one of the big plasma TVs from one of the executive offices. They say there were two of them and that they came in the side fire doors at 5:40 PM and were out the same doors by 6:05 PM. (they were caught on tape) The funny thing is, people were still here! But no one saw anything. Amazing.  It had to be an inside job. I'm just jealous that it wasn't me.

						   Well, OK, not on my hands... on my tire.   I was driving down the road, singing along with Tears for Fears, when a big racoon ran into the road. I cranked the wheel to the right and hit the brake. I almost lost control. It was all for naught. I hit it.   I didn't squash it with my tire. There were no guts flying everywhere.  I know this because when I looked back in my mirror it was doing one of those breakdancing back spins in the middle of the road.   I am reminded of the time back in college when kicked a dove. I thought it would fly away! I didn't know it was just going to sit there and let me kick it! I was walking to class across the main mall and there were birds everywhere. I stared walking through a bunch of them... and I just kicked one. I could feel the little breast bone through my shoe! It kinda went up in the air and fluttered a bunch before it took off. Man, I got some death looks from these girls that had seen the whole thing. I looked at them and said, "I thought it would fly off!"   Let me just say that I love animals. (This is where Brad would say, "No, he LOOOOOOOVES animals.")  On a happier note, I got two new shirts and some shorts at the mall today.

						   So I go to Phil's last night, you know, to go out to eat and watch a movie... And what do I get? I get verbally abused. He said so many nasty things to me that if I repeated them I would probably get fined by the FCC. I won't even begin to tell you what he wanted to do with my mouth. And what set him off?  I refused to spoon with him. Remember when I said none of my friends are gay? I was wrong. The married one is most definitely gay.  By the end of the evening, he was asking me to shoot him in the head with his gun. I think I would rather shoot him in the knee. I mean, watching him suffer is actually kind of fun.  Last night I had the "Cowboy Burger" at Applebee's. I would reccomend it. It's like a whole cow between two buns. With a little bit of pig in there to boot.   I live in Texas. And it's July. But yet, there's a cold front coming in. Tomorrow it's supposed to be in the 80's all day. Um... if that isn't a sign that Jesus is coming, nothing is.  Oh yeah. One night, Pete almost peed on Brad's bookself. (I added that because I haven't said anything about Pete yet.)

						   I was talking to my friend, BRAD, on the phone not too long ago...  He let me talk to his Gnome friend... who is apparently Irish, because he spoke with an accent. I told Brad to kill the Gnome, but Brad said, "No, I need him. He drives my boat." I realized that with Brad in my life, I'll never run out of Blog material.   Our conversation ended when he started panting a lot, groaned and then got really sleepy. I don't know why.   I've learned something today...  Scotty is an instigator. Phil is an agitator. Brad is a flatulator. Pete is a f*cking squatter. And I... am soon to be unemployed.  Oh, if anyone out there has $168 million dollars they can loan me, I would be most grateful. (stupid Subaru)

						   Back in the day, I liked to drink. After work, me and my friends would make our way down to the Stoneleigh P every Monday, because Monday sucked. And every Tuesday, because there was nothing else to do on Tuesday. And every Wednesday, to celebrate making it halfway through the week. And every Friday, because you're supposed to drink on Friday. (We never went on Thursday. Because that was good TV night.) I'd order a pitcher of Shiner Bock and that was all the dinner I needed.  These days, and hundreds of perscription Zantacs later, I can't drink so much. But, I've dedicated one night to drink. Wednesday night. Big glasses of beer for only $1.75. But there's something not quite right...   Now all my drinking budies are gone, and I go drinking with Scott. Back in the day, Scott NEVER drank. NEVER. NEVER EVER. Then he met this girl... (insert downward-spiral sound effect here) Now he can drink me under the table. The waitresses at tit-bars know his name. And he often has to get ME to go out to drink with HIM. It has to be a sign of the apocalypse.   So I just came back from drinking with Scott. I'm way drunk. I'm about to pass out on my bed. And yet, the only thing running through my mind right now is a conversation I had with my friend Brad. He told me that the next time he gets a blow job, he wants to have two plungers with him... he wants to put them over each ear of the girl and plunge away while she services him. You see, he wants to get the maximum amount of suction possible out of her.   God, I miss those pitchers of Shiner Bock.

						   That said, today one of them told me he missed me so much that he was going to put a tattoo of my face on his stomach, but he was going to put it on upside down, that way he could look down at me and look me in the eyes while talking to me. I think I'm against that happening.  On that topic...  This young boy hit on me yesterday. I let him down easy. You know... because a "boy" could never afford to keep me happy. But in the back of my mind I was thinking... yeah, I'm old, but I still have a sweet ass. At least that's what Phil says.  Oh, and my hack- radio scripts went over big. Now I have to do a lot more of them. Damn.  Today's Against: (all the things I'm against today)  1. David Hasselhoff singing in German. 2. Testicular cancer 3. Car salesmen 4. Pet health insurance 5. Clear Channel

						   I told him I'd change all their names, but I lied. His name is Brad. My other friends are Phil, Scott, Bur, Pete and Khalid. Sure, there are others, but these will be the main characters of the book I plan to write one day. I don't know if anyone would buy it, or believe it.   Brad made me set up this blog, then was afraid of what I'd write. I'll stay away from all the sex stories... especially since none of us have any.  Anyway, I have to go write some bad radio scripts now. Bad part is, I know they'll all get killed, but I have to write them anyway.   My life story begins here tomorrow. Stay tuned.

						   Ok, let's talk about LINK. I hate them. All of them. Even Brad's friend Andy. Hate him. Why? Because I'm petty.   LINK is the group that was formed to save the agency. Pieced together by the un-touchable Todd Tilford. He and his group, whom we all call the "Toddlers" sit in the corner of the building, playing their guitars, and saying the word "cool!" really loudly, but they don't seem to be doing any real work at all. I mean, these guys are making a shit load of money, but they have no real clients. Oh, sure, there's Jean Connection and Goode Records in Dallas. And some Ski shop in Colorado. But I don't think stores are paying those big salaries.   Actually, this week I found out what they've been working on. T-Shirts! How lovely. And they're all displayed in the art gallery area of the agency. And they're for sale! All I have to do is make the check out to LINK! Wow. So that's what a $100,000 a year art director does. He makes T-shirts. Meanwhile the poor girl beside me, who, like me, hasn't seen a raise in 3 years, is so slammed with shit-work she eats peanut butter at her desk everyday... *deep breath*  It's OK to hate these people, right?

						   Well, after reading that we didn't even get into, much less win, the Subway pitch, I've decided to look at TM's track record since we've moved into this new, expensive, huge building...  Let's see, we've lost the following accounts:  J.C.Penny's ($250 million) Bank of America ($80 million) Verizon Direct ($75 million) Nortel Networks ($60 million) La Quinta ($25 million) Rich's Department Stores ($8 million) Hollywood/Bally's/Paris Casinos ($10 million) Match.com ($1 million) Pilgram's Pride ($2 million) Subaru of America ($165 million)  And we've won and kept these accounts:  Bell Helicopter ($3 million) Adams Golf ($1 million) Um...   Anyone see my life jacket?

						   Yes, he called to tell me that he had gotten laid this weekend!   Well, actually, he told me that he was in his local Target and saw a really hot mom. So he followed her. He hid in the aisle next to her and spanked one off while peeking at her through the merchandise. "For me," he said, "that's close enough."   Hey, buddy. I say congratulations! I'd shake your hand, but... you know.

						   Ok, so she's done some bad stuff before. But not in a while. I don't know why she did it. I don't know what to do about it. But it all worked out for the better...  Daphane chewed up the cord on my mouse.   I could have killed her. She used to do that kind of stuff a lot, but she's old now. Maybe she's telling me i spend too much time on my computer.   So I went mouse shopping... and got a cool wireless one! (It was actually cheaper than the regular Apple one.) And while I was there I looked around... and got a cheap DVD player for my bedroom. No, it was really cheap. I love Fry's.   In the end, I guess I should thank my cat. And I will. Just as soon as she's off life support.

						   Oh, my God. My head feels like it's going to pop. It's one of those sinus headaches. Don't you love those?  Anyway, I had the day off today. Went to lunch in Ft. Worth with my friend Tina and took an afternoon nap. Man, what a busy day. And what did you do... work? Pardon me while I laugh at you.   Well, at least today wasn't a total waste. You see, Brad gave me another one of his Tips On Women.  I told him about the really, really, really hot mom in HR that tried to flash me on the highway. (wasn't my car, so she flashed a stranger.) So what did Brad have to say about that?  Brad: "You should go down to her and say, 'hey, flash me' and when she does run up to her, pull her shirt over her head and start punching her in the face... you know, like they do in hockey... yeah, that would be cool."  OK, pizza is done. Gotta go.

						   OK, get this. We're doing a pro-bono project for some rich old Dallas ladies that run The Cattle Baron's Ball. Millionaires that do a fund raiser thing for cancer.  We have to design their look and the cover of their auction book and all the printed material they do. This year's theme is "Pancho and Lefty" because Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard are singing for them. Stupid theme for a party, but whatever.  Anyway, they LOVED all the covers that the art director did. One uses this really old, weathered Texas flag... it's awesome. And she did a music theme with a guitar and Texas flag. Awesome! But then, one of old ladies got an idea... how about a cover that uses a horseshoe theme? Why? Because, "she really likes horses."   Um... what?   Then they started talking about putting horseshoes into the concepts that were shown, but the art director put a stop to that. Now she's trying to do a quick comp with horseshoes for tomorrow's meeting. And you KNOW that's the one they'll pick. Never fails.

						   You know you’re in trouble when you wake up and you don’t know where you are. It’s worse when you can’t move your arms and legs. Hmmm, I think I had too much to drink last night… Shit! I can’t move my arms and legs!  I remember meeting one of the most beautiful women in the world last night. It was like a whirlwind romance you’d see on TV. One minute we’re at the bar, the next we’re on the dance floor, the next we’re in the second stall of the men’s room doing what’s on page 131 of the Kama Sutra. After that we went to the nearest James’ Coney Island and ate six hotdogs each. She invited me back to her place. Who was I to say no? I mean, after what I just did to her mouth in the men’s room, I felt obligated to marry her. I remember walking in her apartment. It was dark. There was the smell of leather. Somewhere in the back room a CD of Kenny Rogers was playing.… and things get sketchy from there.   Now it’s morning and I can’t move. Oh, now I see why. She’s chopped off all my limbs. Ha-ha! Man, what a relief! For a second there I thought I was tied to her bed. That would have been the end of our relationship. I mean, I don’t get into that kinky shit.

						   ...your poop schedule gets thrown off?  Everyone has a poop schedule. You just get used to pooping about the same time everyday.  Then something happens and you start pooping at like noon instead of early evening like normal and you're like, "what the hell?" I mean, now you have to poop at work, and I'm so against pooping at work. What is that? I mean, what throws you off?   Oh, wait. It's noon.... gotta go. No, really, I gotta "go."

						   Goes out to my friend Brad. He's been helping me get back into the dating scene. Little by little he's been helping me out with little bits of knowledge that's he's learned over the years.  So far, I've learned two important things:  1. Any girl who'll eat six hotdogs will surely take it up the ass. 2. Never do a girl in the ass after she eats six hotdogs until after she poops.  Thank you Brad. With your help, I'll be married in no time.

						     There are lots of things I'm looking forward to: A new job. A new vehicle. The day I can be Republican again. Me being 65 sitting on a porch somewhere yelling at kids to stay out of my yard while I'm not wearing a shirt and I'm drinking a Lone Star beer at 7 AM.   There are some things I'm not looking forward to: Being laid off. My phone bill. My next trip to the dentist. The next time Brad starts telling me about the size of one of his poop logs. Phil touching me. And Thursday morning after drinking with Scotty.   And then there are some things that I don't really care about at all. Like the wierd growth on my back. And the guy that lives in my closet that's been eating all my old lunch meat.

						   You know what I hate about advertising? Clients.   So a while back I had to write an ad for Texas Instruments. It was hard for me because it was about technical stuff like changeable IC adaptors and CSP burn-in test sockets. But, I did my research and wrote the best copy I could. I knew there would be changes, right? So, we get the change notice from the client this morning...    Here's what the client said: "We are lacking buzz words in the copy. Examples of words we came up with include 'cutting edge technology,' 'leading edge,' and 'next generation.' Can the ad agency's writer help us out here?"  Um... so that's why they kicked this ad back? Because I didn't use enough effin' buzz words in the copy?!?!   Yeah, I got some buzz words for you, Mr. Client. How about, "go fuck yourself," or maybe "pull your head out of your ass," or my personal favorite, "I hope you all die of massive anal bleeding."  Man, I need a Dr. Pepper.

						   I am happy to report that I had a nice weekend. I didn't go shopping. I didn't go lay out by the pool... in fact, I didn't do much of anything. I did clean my apartment... but I always do that. Oh, and I broke my toilet. Damn it.   I watched two good movies. On DVD I watched The Cooler. That has William H. Macy (I think) and Alec Baldwin in it. GREAT movie. I loved it. You HAVE to see that movie.  Saturday night I saw The Village. I liked it, but I kinda figured out the ending half way though the movie. That's not to say it didn't have other big surprises, because it did. And it did scare the poop out of me a couple of times. But, with that M. Night Salamander guy, you know a good ending is coming. So I ruined the movie for myself by trying to figure out what the ending would be.   Today I only left my apartment once. I went to Taco Bueno to get me some mexidips and chips and a coke. Gotta have my soda for the day. While I was there (I went inside), I saw a guy with a Longhorn hat. I said, "nice hat." 20 minutes later I was trying to get out the door with my food, but he kept talking to me. We were talking about the upcoming football season. The lesson here is to always use the drive-thru.   Oh yeah, Phil? I told my mom that you still have hot sauce left from the last time she sent some. So she said, "Oh, well. I guess he doesn't like it. I had some in my freezer for him... I'll just give it to Jim."  Oops, sorry about that.   BRAD'S QUOTE OF THE WEEKEND: (actually, there are two.)  "Sucking dick is like having an abortion. Once you do it, you have to live with the guilt."   And sort of along those lines...   "I love the smell of wood."

Especially my closet. (G or NG?)  3. I have 16 pairs of shoes. (G or NG?)  4. My belt, watch and shoes almost always match. (G or NG?)  5. I hate big dogs (and Phil's small dogs). (G or NG?)  6. If i have nothing else to do... I'll go to the mall. (G or NG?)  7. I'm addicted to that WB show Summertime, or Summerland, or Summer something. (G or NG?)  8. I also like the WB shows One Tree Hill and Everwood. (G or NG?)  9. And I like watching WWF wresting. (G or NG?)  And last, but not least,  10. My best friends always say they want to abuse me sexually... and I still hang out with them. (G or NG?)

						   Maybe this should be its own segment of my blog. Because even though he knows what he says will end up here, he still stays it. I even remind him that I'm taking notes, and he'll be normal for a while, but he always backslides back into weirdness.  So, yeah, he called. Why? To tell me he found cookie crumbs in his pubes. But what was strange was that he hadn't eaten cookies in three days. No, I don't know what's wrong with him.  I think the most interesting part of the conversation was when he asked, "Hey, have you seen that Bowflex commercial with that 50 year old grandmother? She's hot!" He finished his thoughts on this subject by saying that this Bowflex commercial is great porn. Because it's something you can watch with your parents.  I would just like to say I love all my friends. No... I loooooooove all my friends.

						     OK, so last night, Scott not only drank, he smoked. He SMOKED! To put this in perspective, it would be like a Catholic watching the Pope have anal sex with a transvestite whore. It's just not supposed to happen.  We did have fun last night. The band (Soma) was good, Bur was there with us and we drank a bunch. Bur was trying to get me to go talk to this manly-looking black girl. I bet she could have... um... shown me a few things. But I couldn't do it.   I'm sure my eyes were red during my interview this morning. But that's OK. I hated that bitch that I talked to. She didn't seem to know anything. My "interview" only lasted 15 minutes. She said the boss guy was on vacation. Then why the fuck did she ask me to come in?! Screw her and her job. I'd rather collect unemployment. Now I'm stuck being dressed up for the rest of the day. Well, jeans and shoes, but to me, that's dressed up.   Oh, Bur had the quote of the night. Scott said something about only being a "little white trash." Bur said, "That's like being a little gay. Sorry, even if you put just a little bit in, you're all the way gay."

						   Ok, since we lost the Subaru account, I've had nothing to do. Not a good sign, right? Well, I've had some small American Airlines projects to work on, but those are easy. For lunch I go to a mall and walk around for an hour, eat, then walk around some more. And no one says anything. I also started coming in a later... like 9:45 AM. And no one says anything. I've been wearing shorts and flip flops everyday. Even to meetings. And no one says anything. I'm about to lose my job and I'm just now starting to like it!   I've discovered the real difference between my two good friends Brad and Phil. Brad is just eff'n weird. Phil is psychotic. See, Brad told me that it takes him 2 to 3 minutes to get it up to jack off... while he's taking a dump. Phil threatened to push his stool down my esophagus with his penis. You know... I think I'm going to move out to Cali with Pete. He's normal.

						     Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad.  Quote of the day: "How come you didn't use my name in the last post? I jerk off to seeing my name on your website." - Brad.

						   OK, so I was talking to... my friend... and we were discussing a very important matter: dirty girls.  I can't tell you what he said... it would make you throw up in your mouth. But I can take some words out and then you can make up your own definition. So, finish this sentence and tell me what makes a dirty girl:  She'll ______ my _______ after I put it in the ____________.   It was quite a conversation we had. We discussed that it was OK when girls rape and that tropical storms are merely thunderstorms gone bad. All in all, it was a nice phone chat.

						   I get home from the supermarket on Saturday and this message was waiting for me on my answering machine:  "Hello, Daphane. It's Brad. I understand Richard is at the grocery store. So it would be a good time for me to slip by for a quickie. I'll bring some catnip and some peanut butter. Go ahead and shave your ass for me. Oh, and don't forget the batter this time."  Did I mention... Daphane is my CAT?   All I could think was, "So he's after pussy now? I wish he'd make up his mind."

						     An 18-wheeler takes a corner too fast.  It falls over.  It catches on fire.  It's a tanker truck.  It's carrying 9000 gallons gasoline.  It falls into the parking lot... OF A GAS STATION.  Oh... and it's all happening 200 yards away from my front door.  Of course, I wasn't there at the time. And nothing really happened. We had no electricity until late at night. And I couldn't drive to my apartment, so I had to park down the road and walk. The next morning, when I went to get my car, I could see that the gas station sign had been melted away. That was cool.
