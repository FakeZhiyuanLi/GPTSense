HURRAY!!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i din go to school&nbsp; today because i overslept.. once again.. my bad habit is back.. i guess my teacher is going to tok to mi again&nbsp;:( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; todae, i read The Purpose Driven Life chp 12.. teaching us how to develop yur friendship with God&nbsp;.. i learnt that  God listens to passionate words of his friends ; he is bored with predictable, pious cliches..  at the moment.,.. i am aiming to buy the book... BIG GIRLS DUN WHINE.. kind of like the book&nbsp;after&nbsp;looking at the caption.. hope to&nbsp;have it by SAT!!&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to Linkin Park songs.. less i hear the less u said.. u will find out anyway.. blood is pouring... i become so numb.. holding too tightly.. afraid to lose control.. all the bits and pieces  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SHOUTING TO MYSELF

						    i nv thought of creating a blog but it just happen that i was being " tempted" to do so..  lazy to explain how and why ...     a way to waste time .. maybe  a way to express yur self... mayb  whatever it is...    I wan the POWER to push myself to study  I wan the POWER to get rid of STRESS  i wan the POWER to get rid of cockroaches..  I wan the POWER to do everything that benefits all ManKinD
