      Today,....... hmmm. What to say about today, and whatever else has happened since my last post. I cant say anything here that would make up for whatever it is that ive done in the period of time prior to this entry. Im not going to call attention to anything that is particularly depressing tonight. Im done with that. Im not going to let myself feel guilty for something that i 'did' that doesnt require an action. I apologize, but i wont let myself feel bad. Thats the way ive decided i want to live my life, and thats how i will. Anyways, Neal and I took Emily out for lunch today as a late birthday lunch. We partook in various Italian festivities while dining at Joe's, and somehow started the day long conversation of "What are cars named after?" What in the hell is an Alero? Montero? Vue? Nobody knows. Anyways, after lunch, we all rode in Neal's car to Baskin Robbins, because 1) Emily wanted to go there, and 2) She didnt want to drive in the 'rain'. When we arrived, we deliberated upon which flavor of ice cream we wished to consume. Since im boring, and according to them, i like no food, ever, (but i am a fan of racism and Nazi's appearantly...), that i decided to just stick with the cookie's and cream. They on the other hand had to take the purity and wonder that is ice cream, and crush it beneath neal's (terribly clothed) legs of justice. They decided to buy " X-MINT." Some lame flavor to celebrate a far more amazing piece of cinematography. Ok, here's putting it lightly. It was the most unappetizing looking substance in the history of mankind. It was black, yes black, tar black even, and a dark blue. It looked like bubblegum on black top. Disgusting. So of course, they eat it, completely content that im totally and entirely disgusted by it, and then we decide to go roaming. The first stop, "  Cascades...." (in a whisper). Then around the Krispy Kreme parking lot. We saw a lot of nice houses, we gawked, and continued wondering what car names meant. Is a Grand Cherokee a really really really awesome Native American? Anyways, Emily had to go to work, so Neal came over and hung out for a while. We did nothing. For an excrutiatingly long period of time. Then Neal wanted to set up my bench press rack thing, which then involved rearranging my entire game room in order to do so. With that finished, and the clock reaching 9:30, Neal decided he was hungry, so he left. I didnt eat. James came home from Las Vegas later, and brought me some stuff. I smiled, its awesome stuff. And now im here, talking to my cousin from California online. Its been a great day, a simply fantasmic day. Nothing can bother me as of this moment. Oh yea, and Jeff didnt come to my house at 12:45 to get some blank cds without his parents knowing on a bike, in case you were wondering if anything of the sort occurred, because it didnt. Well, im done typing useless banter for now, ill probably resume that task later...  Song of the Day: A Beautiful Day, by U2 Quote of the Day: "What in the hell is an Accord?"

      Well, today wasnt very exciting. My mom had a root canal today, so, to put it lightly, she's not in the best of moods. She's not pissy or anything, just in pain, and i cant blame her. Anything that has to do with teeth is pretty much unjustifiable by medicinal reasons, and is almost always unbearable. Ive been trying to help her out all day. It made me really realize how much she does around the house, its crazy. I love my mother, as do most of my friends. She's adopted half of them, and she's always so cool about having people hang out over here. She's the coolest. Anyways, i was listening to music, (quietly), and just decided to download the most random stuff ever. Stuff that would irritate the hell out of most people. Can anyone say, "Im a punk rocker.."? Ugh... Yea, she dont know no David Bowie, no Sex Piestols, she's like 17, they're like 100. Anyways, i was listening to one of Avril's songs, and i just kinda noticed how during parts of the song, she sounds just like Ashley Elgie. Im serious. Listen to "Im with you", (for as long as you can stand it), and think about how Ashley sounds, its like exactly the same. Anyways, we didnt end up getting any pictures of Toby and his yellow diaper of justice, i wish we wouldve, but the memories will last forever. Haha, still funny... Oh yea, Michael and Jeff came over the day before yesterday, we hung out, it was pretty cool. Michael and I got pissed that Jeff was so good at Clone Wars, i was about to strangle the kid. We were P-I-S-E-D...... Pised? Im taking Emily out for her birthday tomorrow for lunch, anywhere she wants. She's not doing a good job deciding where she wants to go though. Hmmm, i played some more Metroid Prime today. Im still afraid of Meta-Ridley. Im pretty much afraid of that whole game, i dont really know why, cause its not scary. Ill probably try and finish it tomorrow. After lunch, if Emily ever makes up her mind. Jeff leaves friday, ill have another less person to talk to/hang out with, itll be sad. Meh, he'll have a good time in the north. I talked to a girl that i like today, we're gonna hang out some day next week. She's gonna stop by after she gets done doing her extensive cross country mandatory workout. Hopefully itll be a good time and i wont just be retarded.   Im feeling unusually content right now. Pretty much everybody i know, or care about at the moment, is happy. Its awesome how summer does that to people. My views on unhappy people are that they shouldnt keep hanging out with people that: A) Make them unhappy, or B)Are also unhappy. Im in a great mood, i have plans to do stuff this week and weekend. Itll be a good time. Haha, south park is a funny show, i just remembered a quote from the episode, "Asspen". A ski instructor was telling the boys how to ski, and he used the pizza and french fries analogy. "If you pizza when you shouldve french fried, you're gonna have a bad time. If you forget to pizza, you're gonna have a bad time." "When are we supposed to be having a good time?" Haha, download it, its priceless. U2 is one of the greatest bands of all the world. I hope Bono beats out the Pope for the Nobel Peace Prize. Haha. Also, you should listen to the solo that Mista Martinez wants me to play, its not possible. Carnival of Venice is the name of Satan himself. Download, and begin to cry immediately. Anyways, im done doing my rambling for the night.

      Happy Birthday to Shauna!!!!!!! Oh, and by the way, what happened yesterday, all that talk, i was just in an extremely bad mood. Don't worry or anything, its all good. I had a lesson today, i sucked. Maybe i should practice...... I did get to see Mr. M's braces though. You can't even see them practically, its not fair. Anyways, im better than him at the moment, it made me smile. Anyways, people are coming over to hang out tonight, and my family is now gone. Hooray! If you want to hang out, just show up, its all good. It'll be a fun time. Tell Shauna Happy Birthday, or else. Ill update again later, with something happier, i promise. I need to go run or something, anything that makes you happy.

      I am a selfish, heartless, proud, independent bastard. Its official. I think ive managed to piss every last one of my friends off in the past month. I love the fact that i dont know what im doing to anybody either. I pissed off jacob earlier, i dont know how or why, i was reading what he was saying, trying to really absorb it, and i was doing other things, like check and write e-mail, and he gets all angry because i didnt respond or anything or whatever. I dont know, i dont even know who im typing this to. I dont have any friends who read this anyways. So its just me, feeling sorry for myself as usual, but of course, i wont burden you with my problems, heaven forbid that i concern you with anything that has to do with my god forsaken life. I really do admire jacob for trying to help me tonight, trying to convince me im no burden, but if im not, then why did he get offline in a rage. I want to know the logic behind that one. I wonder if i have any sharp knives in my house... My head still hurts. I wish i could make somebody happy. Just at least one person, thats all i want. To make somebody truly happy for once. I want to be able to make somebody cry or pass out, or faint, or just fall over giddy in glee and joy. I could care less how i feel at that moment, but i just want somebody to be happy by my hands. Maybe Jacob is right, maybe i should open up more. But then again, what is this, pretty much open to me. Its not like i expect anybody to solve my problems. Thats the reason for why i dont even ask for help. I wonder why i feel the way i do sometimes. At least everybody else pretends they're happy most of the time. I was told tonight that i scare a lot of my friends, and that i make people worry. I feel awful. My head hurts, maybe ill do something to stop the pain....

      Yep, im in a super terrible mood/mindset today. I just feel like "whats the point". A friend of mine, who's been very awesome to me lately, summed it up well. He said i was apathetic, and i replied by saying that caring about everything has brought me this far, why not try a change. He knows me so well, he knows my feelings, he knows what kind of person i am, and i wonder how he knew that stuff while i sit here confused as to why i cant even bring myself to go up stairs like normal people, or stop counting things. I've had a lot of headaches lately. I've been around too many people and heard too many thoughts the past couple of days. My head hurts now. You wouldnt understand what its like to have to focus on what you are thinking about personally. Nevermind, i dont want to get into that. My problem is that i care about people, and i dont want them to care too much about me. I feel bad when i tell people my problems, because i dont want to cause any distraction in their life by forcing them to concern themselves with mine. I feel bad for making people talk to me about my problems because i know that whatever is bothering me has affected somebody else too. My head hurts. If you were here right now, i would know what you thought of this, and i would also know how confused you were while you read. Maybe ill tell you if you ask me what this means, but you wont believe me, its stupid to me. Im glad i have good friends, 2 mainly who both stayed up late to talk to me even though they have drumline camp tomorrow. I appreciate people, i just dont know why they appreciate me so much. My head hurts.   Song of the Day: Cross My Heart, by The Rocket Summer Quote of the Day: Any of the humorous things i felt or heard from people ive been around all weekend.

      I leave today for my family reunion. Hooray... Meh, itll be alright. My family isnt as dysfunctional as some. It'll be a good time. Well, ill need to hang out with people upon my return, so keep your schedules open. I wont be online, or updating for a couple of days... and ill be bored. But, hopefully, my family will keep my occupied and in a good mood. Im happy now, i dont want that to stop.  Song of the Day: Die Another Day, by Madonna Quote of the Day: "Can you say banana?" "No!"

      Family! So many family members here today. Kinda a good time most of the time, but there's always the down bringers. The baby is cute, but its louder than Coach Horton, (if you remember him), and enjoys screaming, kicking, and breaking things. My cousins from California came down too, they're super awesome, and so "hip", (there's that word again), cause they live near Hollywood... or not so much the hipness. Meh, either way, it was a good time, much fun was had by all. My friends are still great, i just feel terrible for not being able to see Emily on her big day of birth. Most of the people i know are happy at this moment, which in turn makes me ecstatic. I feel great when everyone around me feels good. I could most of the time care less whats going on in my own life as long as the people i care for are alright. Wow, Conan was freakin hilarious tonight, haha, Wrist Hulk, haha, so funny. There's not a whole lot on my mind tonight. Im not still laughing right now, because toby got his diaper off, and we didnt get any pictures, sadly enough. I got to bed at 6:30 AM last night, and got up at 10, so needless to say, im a tid bit on the tired side, so ill probably get going soon.

      I just got done talking to Ryan. He's an amazing guy that one. We talked for hours on end about everything. Im considering him one of my great friends now, because he's done so much for me. I feel great now, probably primarily because i talked to him, and even started to open up about things that i normally try to avoid. I feel indebted to him because of the impact he's had on my life so far. Anyways, its early/late, and im in a fantastic mood. Just thought id write something out. I wonder if anybody is reading this. But thanks Ryan, you're awesome.

      Wow, its been an exciting night. You have no idea. Ok, so, i hang out all day, doing nothing, cousins are on their way, and my family has ordered pizza. While we all eagerly await our nourishment, (not so much me, because my teeth hurt like no other), we see a car pull up in front of our house. Excited that we now have food, my family gets up off of their butts, (hard to do), and go look outside, and who other than Mrs. Peek walks to the door. After talking to Kacy's mom for a little while, (who is a pretty hip and cool person, thats right, i said hip), we go back inside to continue waiting for pizza. When our pizza finally arrives, (which is hand tossed, which we all dislike), we eat, and then begin a whole new round of waiting, this time for our cousins. After they arrive, and exchange hugs and news from our lives, we hear the pleasant sound of children crying and dogs yelping. Oh yes, how pleasantly relaxing it was. Anyways, Toby, (my dog), returns from meeting the DOBERMAN that lives down the street, with a big happy giddy BLOODY smile. So we pack him up in towels and throw him in the car and head out for a vet that is open at 9 PM. After locating one, we go inside, toby dripping everywhere and I without shoes, to see the doctor, who by some odd chance of luck and amusement, has a MULLET, multi-colored frog scrubs, and an earring on his left ear. Many laughs i had in the car on the way home. Anyways, after Toby got his 3 staples for his LACERATION, and a big stupidly hilarious looking yellow diaper for his punctures, (haha, so funny looking), we returned home, where Toby then does not move after being placed on the ground again. He doesnt move at all, not even a step, its so funny. And now im here, still laughing at Toby's rediculous diaper. Haha, you have to see it, ill take pictures. Anyways, thats all for today, im done, and thats the extent of my day.

      Hmm, thought for the day, i need to do something with my hair, it needs a change. I know i promised somebody that i would grow it out, but im just looking for an idea of what to do. Give me some suggestions, or else you'll be forced to look at the terrible mess on top of my neck, (no, not my face, there's nothing i can do about that). Tell me what i should do. My cousins come in from Lubbock, yes the huge famous exciting fast paced headlining city of Lubbock, today and they are some of my favorite relatives. All of my favorites live far away, i wonder if thats a coincidence... Anyways, im looking forward to seeing them. You should stop by and meet them, they're awesome, and they have a baby and a really awesome daughter. If you stop by, it might also give them the illusion that i have friends, haha. Anyways, i just felt like posting something, oh, and funny thing said today...  "HopeToBeAnAggie: i wasnt trying to kill you hotstuff793: i know HopeToBeAnAggie: i just hit you in the face with a pool toy, and almost drowned you hotstuff793: LOL HopeToBeAnAggie: that's not attempted homicide HopeToBeAnAggie: just being really mean"  Yep, Cassie's great, if you disagree, i dont care, she's cool to me. If you get a personal quote in here, it means something, so feel proud if you do. Hooray for family reunions this weekend... oh wait, no. SO MANY SMALL CHILDREN. Im not a big fan of the tiny children, but whatever, its only for like 2 days. Well, im out of things to say, may post something later after day 1 of being with Rusty and Mindy, (thats my cousins names by the way).

        A New Look on Life  So i've decided to start a blog. I dont care if anybody reads this, im only doing this for me. I've been thinking a lot, about many things, mainly my friends. I have the greatest friends. The most impactful lately have been my newest aquaintances. The people ive met, and gotten to know have given me so much without asking anything in return, and i feel so lucky to have them, even if i do sometimes do something stupid, like walk home, or hit them in the face with a pool toy, or talk to them late late late into the morning while they try to work on spanish projects. Anyways, if you're reading this, you probably already know me, and you know how i am to you. Im trying to change who i am, im trying to feel happier, feel more free. Im too paranoid about how people think of me, or how they feel at a certain moment in time. I know ive asked everyone reading this at least once if im bothering them, or if im annoying them in some way, and im trying to make that stop, because one of my friends, a great one in fact brought to light how freakin annoying that is. Needless to say, that will stop, at all costs. I also am going to try to think more about myself, not selfishly or egotistically, but more along the lines of getting to know who i am, what im good at, what im not, and learning to accept, and actually get to the point of knowing and enjoying who i am. My other concern in my life right now is that ill never experience love. Its silly to think that now, being only 16 years, 1 month, and 24 days into my life, but regardless of that fact, i feel like im missing out on a lot. My parents tell me such great stories of how their high school sweet hearts brought them such joy, and how it helped them learn and grow as a person. I want to feel that, i want to know that, i want to be able to tell my kids about it. Many of you wont, and probably never will understand how i feel, but i appreciate those of you who have at least tried.   Anyways, off that topic, i had the opportunity to hang out with some of my favorite people today. Kacy Peek, Jordan Peek, Neal LeBlanc, Cassie Cervenka, Allison Bennet, Brittany Payne, and Emily Hahn. They are wonderful, simply amazing. This summer so far would have been total crap if it wasnt for them. Also, ive gotten to talk to a bunch of new people online, and otherwise, you know who you are, but meh. Friends are great, have some, if you dont, you're a loser, and you should get some. Hmmm, what else to write, this is a first entry after all, so im not sure. Everybody else writes such beautiful things in their journals. Meh. This isnt for the enjoyment of others after all, i am pretty much talking to myself here. Kinda like how Emily says everything she types aloud when she's on AIM. Haha, good times.  Might as well end it with something cliché. Song of the Day: Tomorrow by SR-71 Quote of the Day: "I like to take the jello powder, and just drop water on it to make little gel droplets." "  Or you could you know, just make jello or something." Allison and I talking at Emily's.  Well, thats it for now, more to come, if i can think of anything to talk about.

      MARCHING PRACTICE TOMORROW! Kill me now. It was 101 at 7:00 PM today! I cant wait to sign my 3rd contract selling away my soul which forbids me to do/think/be anything but band. It wont be awful. Ill see people. The freshman will be there......... Ill see people, that at least is good. Maybe that girl who flirted blatantly x4 towards me has calmed down. I hope so. Or maybe i dont. I dont know, i guess im desperate. I dont think ill have many plans for the next couple of months, which is kinda depressing, but school wont be so bad. We always make school seem like Hell during the summer. It is sometimes, but half the time you're having fun. ................... "And now, the Keller High School Band, performing their show............. STARS!!!!!" Oh geez. I cant wait........ This show has to be better than the show with the Japanese techno we played while forming 'elemental' shapes on a football field. It must be better. It cant not be better. But geez, stars. Why couldnt it have been like, "And now, the Keller High School Band, performing their show, The Legend of Zelda!" or, "Star Wars" if you really wanted to keep some of the 'stars' effect. I would be all for that, just give me some awesome music, something ill recognize thats catchy and most likely not playable, and im set. You know what would be a great show, a Lord of the Rings show, like where some special color guard people could be the fellowship and such, and some could be orcs and elves and men and dwarves, (sadly to say, id be recruited as a freakin dwarf), but i would really like to be a Ring Wraith. There's nothing cooler than that. Nobody would be allowed to be Legolas, cause then they'd be perfect, and then everybody would hate them. Anyways, im just trying to distract myself from 'stars' for a little while by making up entire different shows. But whats sadder, is that im distracting myself from marching with other marching. Impressive, i know. Im ludicrously bored. I wish i could think of something inspiring or deep to say. But thats it, ^, right up there. Im not too clever as of today. People came over last night, it was fun. Thats it. Im about done. Actually i am. Finished. Fin.  Quote of the Day: "Yea, my dog of 17 years died" "  You're   kidding!"

      Hmmm. Im not deserving of this life im given. Im wasting this gift by making bad choices and doing wrongs to my 'friends'. The mere fact that i have friends still puzzles me. The fact that they read this, and ask me if im alright is something that i dont understand. Why do they care, why does it matter to them that i feel the way i do. I dont understand what makes them worry or what makes them fret over the bendable words that are written out in this journal. Why does it interest people to delve into my life, as they attempt to understand how i 'tick'. I hate clocks, but i love noise. Time isnt real. I hate the fact that people think you can travel through time, or stop time. Time is just a way to keep track of the decay of carbon based life forms. If you could go back in time, then whenever you accomplished what you set out to do would be completed in the future, and you would have no reason to go back in the first place. If you stopped time, everything would stop moving. Even atoms, hence, you would be imprisoned in a motionless universe. You would suffocate because you wouldnt be able to breathe, better yet move at all. And if you could go into the future, to see what will come to pass, you would then realize that whatever you did in the present didnt matter, because regardless of the 'choices' you would make, it would all lead to the future you saw, leaving you to wonder if you are actually living your life at all, or if you are just a puppet being dragged along by the ever present flow of time. You wouldnt have control of your destiny. Anyways, ive been wondering why i put my 'friends' in the awkward and often times bothersome positions i put them in. I know what causes it, but i cant help it. I need to do these things. But i hate that i cant fulfill that need without hurting someone close to me. I wonder how the lives of my friends would be different, mostly i think of how they would be better if we never had met. How the experiences and provocations i put them through have altered their lives, and how they would be if i had never done those things. I also wonder if when i die, that perhaps the world ceases to exist. That maybe, this world, is dependent on my existence, that the people i know, the places i see are all parts of me, and that when i come to the end of my life, that maybe this world stops. Maybe this world would just vanish, disappear, or if it would just carry on like it seems to when anybody dies. I cant see through somebody else's conciousness, which is why i think that maybe the things i see are here for me, and made by me. Its foolish. I wonder what the world   would be like if i werent alive tomorrow. I wonder if anyone would notice, and if they noticed if they would care, and if they cared if they would remember, and if they remembered would they mourn. If the world keeps spinning after i die, then i wonder what the point of it all was. Ive made little positive impact on the lives of others. I wish i was a better friend. I wish that i am a better friend. I wish that i will be a better friend. If i could, i would go back and fix my mistakes, if i could i would stop the world spinning so i could end the mistakes im making, and if i could i would go to the future and see how ive grown. But i cant. Im here now, only now, never anywhere else. I may never be as good as i think i need to be to completely fulfill what is deserved of my friends as a person, but perhaps ill reach something that is close. Im sorry to those of you who ive made uncomfortable, those of you ive made worry, those of you who ive forced conversation out of. I apologize, it wont happen again. Ill see to that. Time. Time marches on. Time sucks ass. There's not enough time in the world to describe how much my 'friends' mean to me. Not enough time to tell them that they've done too much. Not enough time to let them know how sorry i am. Either way, its time for me to stop. Its time to better myself. And its time for change.

      The human thought. Always around, ever flowing, constantly inter-twining, filling our temporary filing cabinets with every scrap of information we gather throughout the day. Thoughts are merely images, sounds, ideas, feelings we experience, which are then brought back, and shown to us again as memories. Ghosts of what was, these memories dance inside our heads, keeping the past alive inside, and allowing us to taste what once was, and what has occured throughout our time, our story, that masterpiece of existence that is created by every person on Earth. The quick fleeting glances and shocks of thoughts that race throughout our psyche every moment of our days are all laced together in one fashion or the next. Some think of the mind as a web, or a net, something usually designed for ensnaring something. I think of it as a strand or a beam. Something that begins but does not necessarily end in an exact place. If you've ever sat down, and actually thought about thought, either when you try to remember how you got to the place you are now, and where you started from, you'll realize that everything you ponder is somehow linked, not necesarily intricated with something else, but loosely connected to another. A single word in a quote, or on a sign you recollect may send your thought process onto a whole other current, leading you to something completely different, or perhaps something remarkably similar. In any case, the human brain is exquisite. Any tool that lets something gracefully transition from one thing to the next without the realization of effort, or connection is truly amazing. Something that i believe influences a person's train of thought, quite often de-railing it from its previous track, is music. Music can change a person's entire mood, straight from melancholy to joyous, or from ecstatic to dismal. The melodic anomaly found in everyday sounds and jingles has an effect on people. Traffic noises, sad songs on the radio, crying babies. Anything obnoxious, or unenjoyable can cause a sudden and drastic change in a persons overall demeanor. But mainly, the way a person speaks often tells the listener how the intricate workings of someones mind is functioning. You can fake it all you want, but the tone and texture of the sound flowing from your lips gives it away. The eyes and face help marginally, but the chords of words, or shaky replies more than likely rat out the inner most divinations of the brain. Thinking is so simple, but figuring is difficult. If one is required to solve a problem which hasnt been presented before, the brain must leave all casual thought astray and focus on a single dilema. More often than not, this leads to stress, due to the over exertion of the mind, and the lack of freedom and happiness brought by free thought. The looseness of our thoughts keeps us sane, keeps us happy and relaxed. When a person is resting, they arent focused on something, they're more than likely not thinking about anything in particular, which eases the heart, and nurtures the spirit. Thought. Think about it.   In summation to all of what was just written, whenever you feel stressed, dont just 'relax'. Let your mind wander from the problem for a while, allow your brain to relax. Its not a physical problem as much as it is a mental one. Just think.

      Envy. Lately ive been consumed by it. The want, the urge, no, the need to have what others have, to be as good or better than someone else. Not ambition, not duty, but jealousy and envy. My favorite color always has been green, its really quite ironic. I find myself everyday wishing that i could switch lives/bodies/personalities with my friends and family. To know what its like to be them, to be better than i am, or so i see it. Im not really good at believing in myself, no, its not a strong suit of mine. Im not real big on pride. Thats at least one deadly sin i wont have to worry about. But then again, im not a real good person to refer to on sins. Anyways, i feel jealous, i feel full of want and desire. Desire for something i can never have, its impossible. A desire that will destroy me inside if i dont do anything about it. I must travel to the fires of mount doom..... oh wait, i got a little carried away. Then again, this will be a quest, a personal quest where i must learn to accept myself, and cast Tnilc Nesnah's Bane into the fires. Satron will not take me with his 7, the Singuls, i will carry on. Wow, its early in the morning, im acting stupid. So much Lord of the Rings. I feel so cool, not like a nerd at all, i promise. Anyways, im bored, its time to sleep. Its time to go into the Emerald Dream, and think of things that have not yet come to pass....

      Yea, its been a while. I dont really care at the moment. At this moment, i just want everybody to know that im extremely happy with most of my friends. And the others, well, they can go straight to a place thats not Heaven. The only reason being is that people randomly get pissed off at me, or have a problem with me, or are annoyed by me, and dont tell me. People block me, then say they didnt block me because they were mad at me, or had a problem with me. What other reason is there, "Oh, well, i just felt like i needed to block somebody, so i sat down, put everybody's name in a hat, and drew yours, thats my reasoning. Whoops, sorry." Yea, its kinda like that. Im not really mad, just confused, i am completely and totally content with my other friends. Jeffrey is back in town, which is cool, Jacob is not, he's on a 2 week cruise of the Meditteranean with his "poor as dirt on the cheek of a homeless mans face" family, and many others are yet unacounted for because either they dont call anybody, sleep all day, or are just at home, doing nothing (like me), and arent really in my mind to mention at the moment. I feel kind of rushed right now, rushed for what, who knows, ive been like this a lot lately. My head doesnt hurt. Which is good. Weird stuff isnt happening, which is good. Ive had the chance to hang out with friends, which is good. But i still feel frantic. I know i need to start my summer reading, but i have way too much time for that. Im still applying for a job, and yea, i know i can get one. Its not really an immediate deadline or anything that im concerned with. Its more like a countdown. It might be the countdown to when i graduate, the fact that i might not see some of my best friends ever again. Maybe its the fact that there's been a lot going on in my life, nothing huge, but lots of little things that make me realize that growing up isnt going to be just big huge bundles of 100% grade A quality fun. Money, relationships, work, insurance, bills, credit cards, check books, house payments, car payments, jury duty, parking tickets, heart disease, alzheimers, coffin shopping, will writing. Not a whole lot of that sounds fun to me, so i guess im just feeling frantic because i know my 'childhood', 'youth', 'teenage years', wont last that much longer. Its just a race towards 40. Wow, i dont want to be that old, but yea, i dont want to not make it there either. I dont know really, i feel rushed, but im not doing anything. Ive been sitting around, not really thinking a whole lot, just passing the days. They're going by fast, just like the last 2 years of my life. I cant recall my first day of high school, or the first time i met, or saw some of my current upperclassmen friends of today. My life is a blur, which is natural. Im just weird, i remember really stupid stuff. i remember breaking a glass dish in the kitchen of the first house i lived in when i was 5. I remember hiding under my bed the first time my step dad, ( in that time, only my mothers boyfriend), came to visit. I remember my first bike ride, and how i ran into a station wagon across the street. I remember swimming lessons, oh lord swimming lessons. Im still wondering how that water wasnt boiling, seeing as the DEVIL was the swim instructor. I remember he wouldnt let me out of the pool until i did what he instructed me to, which of course included using the facilities. So naturally, being like 6, i had very poor control over my bodily functions. Enough said. I remember my first pet, my first dog. And for the more uncommon memories, i remember sitting next to a girl in Kindergarten who would always say, "Move it or lose it." I was terrified of that girl. I remember eating lunch with my teacher in a courtyard in 2nd grade because it was a reward in our class, she always brought a huge huge lunch, like steak and fruit, and the best freaking cheesecake ive ever had. I remember the first time I met the girl i would be in love with for 3 years of my life. She knows who she is, and you probably do too. So many memories, but so many lost. I can remember things vaguely, great times i had, but dont immediately recall. I guess i just hope that the things i do now, this year, this high school experience wont end up totally like that. I hope that when i am 40, (eww), that ill remember my friends, and maybe even call them up every so often. I hope that a lot of things happen, i should stop. Things dont get done just from hoping, so i need to take action more often. I feel ok. I am ok. I just am confused as to why im in a hurry, and why my friends dont tell me whats bothering them. Thats all ive got for now. Im gonna go do nothing, and still be rushed.  Song of the Day: Nightingale, Saves the Day Quote of the Day: "Go Cavs Fo Sheezy", Cassie and Emily

      Yea, so its been a while. Its only been a while because ive had to reload my entire computer. Its been a good time. Might as well get this out of the way.  I Freakin Hate Physics!!!  Ok, thats out of my system. Well, ive changed myself for the better. Some of my dearest friends brought to my attention that ive been an ass many times before, so im working on changing that. No more whining or despairing for me. Im going to enjoy life for once. Yep. Anyways, im listening to amazing music, i know it sounds lame, but its orchestrated music, but nothing puts me in a better mood than a simply stunningly arranged piece of music. Im the biggest band geek i know right now. I realized today that many of the girls i know have names that in an "E" sound. Cassie, Emily, Valary, Espi, Natalie, Ashely, Kacy, Casey, Brittany, Whitney, Cheri, that kinda works, i dont know, im stretching now. Eh, there's not a whole lot on my mind. Oh yea, Katie. Ah, Katie. Yea, so ive been seeing some of the people that i used to be bestest friends with a lot more lately. Its awesome, like Megan Starkey, we were the greatest of friends back in the day. Maybe we'll get like that again. I havent been seeing Amanda as much anymore, i havent seen her at school not even one time. We'll hang out soon hopefully. People are coming to watch movies tonight, it should be enjoyable. Cassie's been bugging me about this stupid thing, so i figured i might as well find it, and then update it. So here it is.

      Hmm, this weekend was great. The parties were fun, especially the horn party. And this weekend not a whole lot happened. Oh yea, there is that one thing. My great aunt gave me her car. Its not cool at all, its a 1992 chevrolet caprice, but its free, and the insurance is like only $100 dollars, and there's nothing really wrong with it. So im not complaining, and my parents say if i can take care of it, and keep a job, 'they'll see what they can do' about a new car. So yea, its pretty cool. Im trying to make the car as stupid as possible, complete with fuzzy dice, beads, maybe some fringe, maybe some of those beaded seat covers. I dont know, stuff like that. And ive named it Remy Lebeau, because its burgundy colored, it has the fuzzy dice, and because its just a cool name. Anyways, its a pretty cool thing, but yea, the car isnt cool at all. It has a V8, which is nice, but other than that, wow. Hmmm, i really want a different car, but this one is free, and it might lead to a new awesome car down the road.

      Wow, Haniman. He said 'uh, um, or err' about 242 times in a matter of about 45 minutes. He's a robat. Mrs. Benbow also has the most annoying voice in the entire world. But the most surprising thing of the day, is that Mrs. Casey was actually pretty cool. Hard to believe, i know, but she was nice, and she joked around. Its insane. The first day of W.E. was alright, it still feels weird saying that. We played through the first movement, it sounded alright, we need some serious work though. Today at practice, we had a kid come that had never been at practice before, so i had to teach him everything we've learned in the short time of an hour and a half. He might be ready for the audition, but honestly, i highly doubt it. Well, i was going to hang out with kacy today, but i never heard from her, turns out she was just out later than she thought. Anyway, auditions are tomorrow, im really worried about making it.............. Well, i got no sleep last night, i finished my homework, and ive had dinner, so i think ill just hang out, maybe work out or something, or maybe call up a friend. Meh, its all cool. Talk to me tonight if you want to, if you dont, thats fine, but id appreciate it if you did. I probably wont be able to sleep tonight either.

I got mad at one of my friends last night for no real reason. Im sorry to her, i hope she knows that. I rambled on to one of my friends and got really weird and aggrivated for no real reason. Im sorry, i hope he knows that. Im not tired, im gonna go practice, right after aqua teen comes on. Im hanging out with Kacy tomorrow, and ill tell her, and this about my first day of school. Itll suck probably, but oh well.

      The sun has just set, leaving tinges of purple and indigo spread thin across the night sky. A mournful finality grips the land as another day dies and passes on, while a promise of a new day chases the emotions created by the waxing moon and gently sparkling stars. The cosmic events leading up to a sunset are incredible. As the earth gently glides throughout the universe, making slow revolutions around our most familiar star, the people living upon it never question or ponder what exactly is occuring in order to allow them to live their lives, see their family, be with friends, or to just be alive at all. People rely on the days to pass, even though they complain about how time flies. Sunsets are romantic, they bring people joy and despair at the same time. Darkness without light is frightening, but a midnight with a loved one is anything but. The pallet of colors cast brilliantly across the night sky as the sun grows dim is breathtaking. Pastels of life and love and happiness fill the minds of those who look upon the cascade of shades and hues on the horizon. A day without a sunset would be too depressing, if the day were as a light switch, simply from light to dark, then many would despair. Its the gentle transition from bright and luminous, to a serene and gentle canvas of violet that allows people to reflect, remember, and relax. A friend of mine gave me my inspiration through a beautiful image of such an event. Clouds cascading over one another as dancing rays of orange and red leaped across a lake. "These are such things that dreams are made of," seems to sum it up well. I feel poetic, even though my ramblings often seem jumbled or muttled. I wish i was eloquent, worthy of remembrance for my oftentimes delusional literary creations. I have other talents in which to fall back on. Like speelling, and doing grammar good.   But yea, next time you see a sunset, think about what it means to you. Think of the people you've affected throughout the day, and dream about what could yet come to pass in the future. Imagine yourself at your greatest, and try with all your might to reach that point in the following day. Be great. Be amazing. Be who you are. Be.

      Tomorrow marks the day when CNN had the highest ratings of all television in the US. I know you've heard remarks about how you should think about how insignificant your problems are compared to what happened 2 years ago, but to me, (this may sound insensitive to many of you), but i think that people should really move on, and not dwell on things that have happened. Im not a big fan of reflection, but i think that rememberance is ok. I dont like putting emphasis on certain days, because then, that in turn almost forces people to think about the tragedy, and remember more than is necessary, and more often than not, memorial days cause victims to relive the trauma they endured. People should mourn, people should pray if you're into that, and people should remember, but people should move on, and maybe even someday learn to put the tragic thoughts away and every so often, think about it, without spending an entire day of memories and pain.   Anyways, im sad for what happened. Regardless of that, the incident didnt really cause any serious influence in my life. Nobody i knew died, nothing i owned was destroyed, and nobody i directly knew was hurt, physically or emotionally. I see tomorrow as a day for others. Forgive me if i dont cry, or ponder, but thats not the way i am. I dont fret over things that dont have impact on me. That's silly. The biggest problem in my life right now is Physics. I hate physics. Robots shouldnt teach.  Im going to miss seeing Cassie Cervenka every day. I hope she doesnt follow the trend of band drop outs and pretty much cease all communication and activity with me. But if she does, it would only be natural. I dont wonder why she quit, it doesnt matter to me. I hope she's happy with her decision, and i hope it works out for her. I dont think any differently of her, and i admire her for following through with what she wanted.   Emily Hahn has held the coolest senior i know award for a while now, and the most neato freshman is a toss up. Hmm, awesomest sophomore, ummm, maybe Ryn Stasky. Perhaps. Junior, thats impossible to say, there's the ever present triumverate of Brent, Jeff, and I. But eh, school is awesome, even if we all hate it. Without school, we wouldnt have friends. Im glad for school. I dont want this year to end, because the seniors i have grown so close to will leave. I dont know what ill do. There's a big world outside of high school, i know, but right now, im in high school. Im still a part of this overly dramatic, frantic, ecstatic world. I hope i never leave, but, its inevitable. After KHS, i may never see the other members of the triumverate. But after all, people need to move on. We cant dwell in the past. But this is the present, and im diving in. Im swimming in the vast and brilliant life that im living, and enjoying every minute of it.   Tell me what i can do for you to possibly bring you to my level of bliss right now. Do it. Ill try and make you smile.  Quote of the Day: " Clint!!!!   Emily!!!  Come on men!

      What dreams may come. I feel incredible today. Simply amazing. The day is bleak but my mood is bright. Today i feel as if my smile could break the cloudcover, releasing the entrapped sun and setting it free to beam down on others. I need a song, something ive only imagined, something ive dreamed of writing. Perhaps i might. Something with bold and easy transitions from favorite melodies and rythms of fantastic pieces mingled with a stunning harmony. Im fit to burst with happiness. I can guess as to why, but im not sure as to how. My friends are awesome. Just great. I wish i could say more, but the tiny clicks of the keys are feeding my need for music. I love the arts. Musical, cinematography, visual, anything. You name it. I dont know, this day is splendid. I need to share my joy with everyone i talk to today. It may be contagious.

      The human emotion is a wretched wretched thing sometimes. The way the world can suddenly tear out the happiness and joy you were just in rapture with and twist and contort it into a completely opposite feeling is so destructive. An enlightenment, be it something really unpleasant to discover, hit me the other day. Its left me little to dwell on than itself. I find myself in a state of meloncholy and depression, as i long for something that i cant seem to grasp, despite the fact that many others  that i know can. Something that eludes me, taunts me, and kills me a little inside, every day. Maybe tomorrow will be different, but i cant see how. Maybe something will come to light, things will change, and all will be good in the world once more. The space that my friends fill is as big as ever, but the hole that they cant is growing. I need that sort of nourishment to be happy, and right now, i havent even had a taste of what i desire. Maybe tomorrow will be different. I sure as hell hope so. If not, things wont change, obviously. Maybe i can learn to cope, which is most likely, but maybe, ill keep dwelling on it. Hopefully not, but either way, its something that i have to do, myself. Nobody can really help, if i aksed, or if they wanted to. It doesnt work like that. I really dont know how it works, or even if anybody could understand this if they tried. Life is good. Friends are good. School is going as well as to be expected. But something still is missing. I wish i knew how to fill the void. Others can, so why cant i. Im only 16, i have the rest of my life, yea yea. But other 16 year olds, and then others that are younger are having no trouble it seems. I dont know, im rambling again. I just wish i didnt need to. This stupid journal has seemed to be somebody i can talk to. Somebody who wont judge me, or mock me. Somebody i dont have to worry about thinking differently of me, or pitying me, or laughing at me behind my back. If i only i could find somebody like this to help me fill the space. If only. Maybe tomorrow will be different.  Oh yea, and hey, if you're reading this, maybe people will like you more, or not talk bad about you behind your back, or act two faced towards you if you dont take people's pretzels, or stare at people because they're having a good time, or ask people to be quieter for no reason. Its just a suggestion. I guess i would be corrupted too if i dated somebody who looked like they just got back from a photo shoot for a gushers commercial.  No quotes worth putting.

A big festive festival complete with all of the festivities usually associated with festivals of the festive variety. Yea, party, itll probably happen, and have movies and games and food and people and air and stuff. So come if you want. Or dont, it doesnt really matter, but ill be having fun.

      Ah, the journal. This simple expression of inner thought. I dont really understand the appeal of writing in it, but there is definately an appeal. I deleted the past 2 entries i wrote. I find them outdated and depressing. If you must see them, i might show them to you, but oh well, the past is the past. Im starting over, and i really like the way things are now. Im glad that the people that i call friends are such forgiving people, and are completely amazing for making their decision. But enough about the tedious workings of my life. I feel inspired. Again. This time not to write a masterpiece, or to talk about what i think, but to just write. To just say what will flow from my fingertips. To write what comes to my hands, as they glide across the wireless keyboard of my soul. I think its great that things are going well for everyone. Everyone, basically is happy, and thats with little exception for the first time in a while. I think its amazing that i can be with and around the people i am all the time. And i hope that i can bring somebody else that i think is really special into that group. Im glad that the sun rises every morning, and im glad that it will continue to do so even after im gone, (at least for the next 80 billion years...). But yea, high school is coming to a close for some of the fantastic people that i have become aquainted to, and i feel that i will miss them more than i think. It wont be keller without them, and it could quite possibly be more boring than ever. When people leave, this town dies a little. Its not a real town to me, its more like a collection. Its just a story of people. Its an anthology of lives. Nothing happens here, in this village, but there's always something to do. I find that fascinating. Ah, Toby is not rugged anymore, and my mom finished my blanket. Its really quite neat. Toby is clean, and i am warm, things are going well. I find that when i write for pleasure, its......... pleasureable, but when i write for zell, its....... not. I cant seem to express myself when i write for a prompt or an assignment. Here, i can say what i wish, without fear of grade or censor, and i dont have to worry about being ridiculed for my expression. Hmmm, i dont really have anything to write about, but just writing makes me smile. Smiling is good, and ive missed it.   Im making a cd for buddy, and i get an excuse to download some great music for her. I also made $100 for selling my old decrepit laptop. Today was good. I played computer games with jeff, and it took forever.   I feel fragmented, but then again, the passage of time this weekend has felt irregular. I wonder why. Maybe the planets are in alignment, or i can sense the leap day, but either way, i feel like ive been stretched. I like the feeling. I feel like there's more time. So im happy. Generally and genuinely happy. I talked to a cool kid the other night who said that he read this for a while, and that it moved him. I dont know if thats true or not, i dont see how it could be, i mean, im not that inspirational, but it prompted me to start this up again. Im not going to change the way i write, but im going to change my outlook.  Insight into my life is all that this offers to others, but to me, it offers an unquestioning ear. It offers understanding and comprehension of all my subtle metaphors, and all of my gentle allusions. I really think that i get too deep in it sometimes, Ms. Zell didnt catch them in my narrative. That made me sad, but im going to talk to her about it. She's going to let me try again. I just hope that ill get another muse. I loved that paper, but it was difficult to grasp. I understand that. Hmmm, maybe ill post it sometime. If anybody wants to see it. I havent had anybody read it but Ms. Zell, and myself, so, i guess it should be shared eventually.  I like long posts, but im surprised that you've stayed reading this far. Its just rambling above. But now i think ill say something meaningful. I think ill say that i enjoy it when my glass is full. I enjoy seeing things half full, even when its apparent that they're half empty. Deliriously oblivious, i have promenaded through the weeks, and made myself aquainted to the sounds of relaxation.   I hope to be trendy tomorrow, i hope to be stylish. Because Cassie and Emily helped me pick stuff out.

      I guess im just a hopeless romantic, but im growing weary of this loneliness. I thought i found somebody that i could confide in, but i was wrong i guess. I feel dumb for letting myself get down over stupid things like this. I feel ridiculous for getting upset for never being kissed. I feel like an 8 year old. I just want to experience what everyone else has. I want to 'fit in', yea, i want that, even though its 'evil' and 'pressuring', it still lets you relate. Being separated or segregated from a group in your head makes you feel differently. I had hope that things would change for a while. Turns out it was just my own naive ideals that crushed my hopes. I keep telling myself im doing something wrong. I keep telling myself that im not doing something right. I know thats wrong, but thats all I can determine. I want someone i can be close to. Someone i can be with and be comfortable. I want a person to know what im thinking, and to care about what i have to say. I want somebody who, when im talking, isnt just waiting for their turn to speak. I want somebody who gives up their turn to listen.  I want to be wanted.

      Hmmm, today was interesting. I was either heading to, or coming from, a PETsMART 8 times today. Toby needed a haircut, and now he looks goofy, so i had to drop him off, then come home, then go get him. Then, i was going to apply there with Emily, but she wasnt going to make the 1:00 time, so i was practically there, so i turned around and went to her house for a bit. Then we went to the post office, with the 1 human attendant, and mailed a piece of postage and spied an awesome little resturant. Afterward, we headed to a different PETsMART to finally apply at 2:00, and arrived at 1:50. Ok, here's where the fun starts.  Mr. Manager, (we never learn his name), greets us at the door after the cashier, (probably my future job if im accepted), calls for him, and he takes us back to the staff room thing to watch an awesome movie. The movie's first 20 seconds consist of the camera zooming in on the stupid ball that bounces off of the 's' on the PETsMART sign, which makes it lower case for some reason. The movie is really corny, and gives me the message that if you don't wear your name tag to work, you'll end up killing all of the hamsters or fish or something because 'if you dont complete all of your tasks here, you may be endangering the lives of pets.' Yea, so, i suppressed my laughter the best i could, (as did Emily), and i made it throught the video. Halfway through the video, at about 2:00 exactly, another applicant, we'll call him "Late Guy" walks in. Despite the fact that he's the only puntcual one of all 3 of us, he still appears late, which forces Mr. Manager to replay the video for him. The incesant smiling of the host guy in the video droned on in my head as i began to tackle the arduous task of compiling the huge sum of unnecessary information required for the completion of a gigantic application repeating over and over that, in simpler words, 'Drugs are bad, you'll get fired if you use drugs.'   Anyways, after the video and application phases, the next, more embarrassing part of the application process began. Mr. Manager took us one at a time into his office to ask us job-related questions. I, of course being the first to finish the application due to the time saved by avoiding having to write down any previous employment locations, was served first with a barrage of very vague and confusing questions/activities. I have hereby branded myself with the title, "New Guy", due to my lack of job experience. He takes me into his office, and the first words he says are, "So, this could be your first job." Wow, um, yea, it will be, and for the sake of it, we couldve stopped there probably. Oh no, the fun went on. Ok, here goes, tell me how you wouldve responded to this. "OK, we're going to do some role-playing, ill be a customer, and you be the associate. I'm in the leash aisle, how would you approach me," says Mr. Manager. Hmmmm, uhhhh, hello sir, can i help you......? Anyways, you get the picture, it went on for a while, and i stumble through it, and he tells me what i couldve done better. Eh, more vague questions came afterward, i answered them with help from my encounters with some of Murtagh's questions, and did my best with those. Me, "New Guy", had finished.  Emily's turn comes. She says that she made herself sound really dumb. Mr. Manager seemed to have an extra skill in that area that few have. She says that she responded several times with phrases like, "I love animals," or, "I like rats and fish and....." Yea, we all had a good laugh. It was quite funny. So then she labeled herself "Ditsy Girl". She had questions like, "How would you rate teamwork on a scale of 1 to 10?", and thats all. Its kinda like, "Hmmm, lets see here, How? on a scale of 1 to 10." So the questions were broad.  We both know "Late Guy" got a job, hands down. He seemed like he didnt give a damn, so he's in. But i think its a battle between "I love animals," and "I have no job experience." I really dont know who will win. I mean, i might be shelling out change to people buying dog sweaters next week, who knows, or Emily might be working in the fish section, because she really doesnt want to work in the equine section at all. Eh, it was fun/hilarious, and afterward there was some good food. You should all go out and apply for random jobs. The only thing is, you might get one. Wouldnt that suck. Eww, work. The rest of the day consisted of usual teenage hanging out, and the watching of many music videos. All in all, a good day. Now, its getting kinda late, not really, but eh, and i need to decide which bed is closest and easiest to dive on to before i fall asleep in this chair. Im lazy, but maybe soon, a working man. Gross.

      Yea, spring break is almost upon us. I can practically smell it. I can taste the freedom, and i can hear the laughter that is approaching. The next 2 weeks should be good. Purely good. Only a few things are bothering me. Maybe just one, and it starts with "M" and ryhmes with Nurtagh. She gave us this enormous  ass ignment over the break. I really dont like that woman. But whatever, she wont ruin my break. Maybe ill figure out this person ive been so confused with. I hope so. Eh. Some things have been brewing for a while, and they finally erupted. Everybody knew they would, i just hope things are resolved quickly. My dad's house was really close to the area that the people on the news are talking about. The damaged houses on the news are about 5 miles from my dads house. I hope he's ok. I love my dad. A lot. He lives by the lake, a lake that should be visited by my friends this summer. Visited before they leave for college, or get ready for the upcoming school year. Yea, that'd be grand. I have to turn in my schedule tomorrow, but im afraid to take "Adolf Whitler." I really am afraid of that class. Im writing a definition paper for Zell that hopefully she wont despise like she has my others. Im really putting a lot of effort into it. I already have an outline, and i have planned to write a draft of it every 3 days. It will be excellent, or else. Im so tired of school right now. I have to study for Zell's test, because i need to do well to raise my terrible average. I need to do well so she will not hate me as much.   Alison Fudge, (a truly awesome chica), gave me a copy of her hoobastank cd. Ive listened to The Reason about 15 times in the past 2 days. Its so beautiful. Kinda reminds me of..... Anyways, i like it when it rains. I dont like walking in the rain with an umbrella, i feel like im trying to defy nature. I remember sprinting through the driving rain in florida with my friends last summer. Thats where i really got to know Emily and Cassie. They're really great friends. Truly great. Im glad i got to learn about them that trip, and i think it was an interesting experience with the whole extreme trouble action. Yay for hidden theme park attractions in Canada. With Canadians.  Yea, i think the rain is peaceful. Even if it is torrential. It washes my worries away. I feel like the rain fills that glass that people label optimists or pesimists with. It makes me optimistic. I look blindly at things, and always see hope when it rains. I love the rain. I wish i lived in seattle. Maybe not, but it was a thought.

      Sorry for not updating in forever, but Mrs. Zell has sapped any love of writing that i may have ever had from my body. I dont plan to write in here for a bit, so dont keep checking back, even though i know that pretty much nobody does, i mean seriously, its me rambling, why do you even look? Eh, stupid AP tests, stupid calculus, stupid powerpoints, stupid prompts. I do not like school, but yea, yay for really cool people, people who's birthdays are may 11th. Yay.  Song- Happy Birthday Quote- "Somebody gave me these cookies,  yea, but its april fool's day, so be careful,  yea, they're probably heroine cookies, *shakes on floor* 'they're so good!' " Katie and I discussing the cookies she recieved from a stranger on apr. 1st in english, good times, good times

      I would like to request some inspiration, as odd as that sounds. I want to hear from people, their comments, opinions, anything, about anything. I would love to just take in their thoughts for a while, so i can try and unwind from my own anticipations and anxieties about life. I'm delieriously happy now, all the time. I love my friends so much, they are by far the most influential and wonderful parts of my life. I wake up everyday, and hope that i get to see them and talk and laugh like always. It fills me with glee to know that ill have at least one more summer with all of them, and I'm even more glad to get to know somebody i think is very special. Please, tell me what you're thinking. Tell me how you feel, and give me some insight into your life. I'll make this an ongoing thing, something that i believe can be something that i could be very proud of. I just really want to live with other people. I feel more alive when people are around, they complete my character and motivate my soul to shine.  Just talk. Release your thoughts through words. You dont have to partake in this excersise of communication, but if you have anything at all that you find interesting or important, please share. I think of this journal as something to help unleash my creativity from time to time. I love some of my previous entries more than anything ive written, because they're real. They're free-flowing thought, something that cant be taught or developed. It just occurs naturally and oftentimes results in some of the greatest art in the world. Think and speak and share and communicate, its the only way to introduce the world to the beauty of your life.  On a side note, I absolutely love Tina Fey, my car, dancing when nobody's watching, eating things that would make Dr. McReynolds cringe, being with my bestest of friends, making fun of dumb people, and realizing things about myself. I love these things. I love living so much, and have for a while now. Things used to be so different, but things change, like all things do. So i dont expect this bliss to be permanent by any means, but i do want to embrace it while i can. Tell me things you love. Off the wall things. Things you didnt even realize until you sat and thought about it. Just tell me.  I would like for this to become something amazing. Like a compilation or memoir of all the people i know. A literary memory of our friendships, regardless of how in depth they are. If you think this is stupid, tell me, thats still a thought, and still an opinion that should be expressed. I love long posts. I know somebody else who does also. They've told me so.  Summer should be tomorrow, it really should. Id get to experience so much more if i were free all the time. I want to learn so much. I want to see and taste and feel more this summer than any other, and i want it to last much much longer. I want to be with my seniors, the seniors ive grown so close to that i take for granted the pleasure of seeing and conversing with nearly everyday. But they're going through their own set of worries. College and what not, and the moving away ordeal. It must be hard. I really want them to be happy, they're amazing people. Meet them.   Let a stream of moonlight fill your sight with intuition, and let yourself foresee your own happiness. Bask in the rays of your own ecstasy and realize that you're living for you. Make a time be your own, and dont be afraid to embrace a moment. Take part of your life, and dont let it take control of you. You're in control of your own destiny, and the paths you take will lead you where you wanted to go. During your journey, keep gazing skyward, to remember the past, and look beyond to your future. Keep your spirits high, and raise those of others to your level whenever possible. I want to bottle some moonlight sometimes, just to shine on people when they're not as inspired as I.  If any of this makes sense to anybody, then im glad that somebody understands what im thinking. If not, then tell me your interpretation, its yet another form of expression, analyzation, and thought.  I really didnt expect to write anything tonight of any real significance, but now, im quite happy with whats come to me.  Listen to something that makes you smile. Recite a quote that makes you laugh. Live.  ~Clint

      Yay for good things. I got a new car. Come see it. I got a new X-Box. Come play it. And now i have a new outlook on life. Come meet me. New stuff, new friends, new opportunities. Yay for people and their neatness, and yay for my friends liking said people. Yay for life, but boo on ap tests. Boo i say, boo. I should've taken a $42 sick day. But then Westbrook wouldve written me up for that too. She's given me 3 detentions for being either actually sick, and at home, and not skipping, being on band trip, and not in the county, or being in the gym taking a damn ap test. She really needs to stop ninja-watching, and get to checking accurate roll.   But yea, yay for people and things and events that make me happy. Yay for banquet last weekend, and yay for my date and my friends, and everything.  YAY . And its almost summer again! Its a good time, and my writing sucks ass. Its not creative, or neatly flowing in form, its straightforward, childlike, and relatively simple in articulation. But im analyzing more literature, even after a 3 hour english test. Boo AP tests. Boo. Yay for maybe seeing somebody tomorrow in english again after their $42 sick day. YAY.  Song of the Day: The Hey Mama that we didnt get to dance to...

      Hmmm, so im sitting here, thinking to myself, what is something interesting to put in here. Well, ive thought about it for a while, and had some okay ideas, so i think ill just start writing, and see what develops. Here goes...  I played freeze tag with small children a while back at my dad's house in Acton, Texas. Afterward, (several hours afterward i might add), i thought about how every step in human development has its own common desire. I became aware of the fact that kids do whatever is in their power to make games last forever. While playing freeze tag, the kids started cheating in order to keep the game going. I played freeze tag, as "It", for 2 hours straight without finishing a game. I came to the conclusion that the first stage of human life never wants the game to end. The game that is life. The unfolding adventure of each new day, and any misadventures that occur along the way.   Later, i realized that the second phase of development is the phase im currently a part of. The adolescent, pre-adulthood, teenage years. I know that all of us have thought about leaving our hometowns at least once a day, every day, for the past several years. How you'll miss your friends, the people you've spent your childhoods with, your favorite times together alongside, and your hardest times working through with. I read my last post just a moment ago, and saw how desperately i wanted to be done with school, but i remember, at the same time, i  dreaded the fact that it was another step in the direction of dispersion. The friends that i will inevitably part from, and yes, possibly forget one day, are what keep me sane and alive every day. I decided that teenagers never want their 'lives' to end. They never want to leave what they've grown so accustomed to, and what they seem to grow in to. The possibility of a different, possibly less pleasurable, possibly more difficult prospect of life after high school and college is something that people like me want to keep at bay. I want these years to never end.  Although i havent experienced the next phases myself, ive gathered enough experience with people of these classes to be able to formulate ideas on them. People in there twenties and thirties, for the sake of classification, lets call them 'youths' as it were, despite their age in comparison to my, or possibly your age, seem to treasure just that, their youth, above anything else. The ability to play, run, jump, drink, smoke, dive, swing, swim, and sex with no regard to the consequences is the drug of choice to the people in this class. The fact that their bodies are still capable of everything they could in the teen years, and the fact that they're adults and of expanded experience, creates something that is precious, a sort of limited opportunity for bliss. I see the main fear of these people as the process of aging. I think that the 'youths' never want their youth to end. They want to stay as virile and agile and mobile as they can for as long as they can. They want to stop the clock.  Mid-life crisis survivors and other middle aged people are the next classification. The fact that they're not a 'youth' anymore encroaches on their minds as their years accumulate. They buy expensive objects in hope of appeasing the need for their youthfulness, and explore new endeavors in hopes of drowning out the memories of their past. The inevitability of decrepitude begins to haunt their dreams. Middle-aged people never want their health to leave them. They want their youth returned, and their vigor restored. They want the clock to turn back.  The ancients, the elders, the decrepit, the geezers. They spend the rest of their days reflecting on their lives. Their experiences, their thoughts, their ideas, and their loves. They tell the youngsters stories of when they themselves were young, while often their tales fall on bored ears. The idea of youth is gone, and the fear of death and the realization that it could be close at hand is ever present. The elderly wish for their memories to sustain them, and their offspring to remember them. They want the clock to keep ticking.  I love writing, as you probably have guessed. But i also love feedback, be it positive or negative. I like to observe, i like to interact, and i like to experience. I wish i could say something deep in here, but i just write down what i feel.   I want to go see Dodgeball and Anchorman with somebody. They know who they are. I will break them out of their house if their parents wont let them.  There's only two songs on my mind tonight, Masque for one, its the only song i whistle at least once a day, and Roxeanne, the Moulin Rouge version, because "its so powerful."  Write something down whenever you get the chance, itll brighten your day. By the way, now you can leave comments on any of my posts, it would make my day if you left some, and remember, i can delete the ones that are stupid. So if you're stupid, dont bother leaving a comment. ~Clint
