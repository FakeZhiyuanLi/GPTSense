      as the "game" is been played on..( only janice and i know what game is that) i dunno how to settle it... should i say out what i feel or keep it.. i know it is selfish.. but it is really nice to been cared and pampered by someone... really it is... i know it might be a lame excuse.. but i dun have my kor's care and dun have his concern now.. so i really dun mind having an online friend to care and concern.. to make sure that i do my things... to be there for me.. what should i do now?
