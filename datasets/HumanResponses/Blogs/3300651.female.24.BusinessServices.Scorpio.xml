      Today was truly a day I would remember forever. I had spent a wonderful, fruitful, fulfilling and adventurous day today. I came home 11plus feeling all too tired and kinda blurred out on what actually happened the whole of my Satur-Day.  Left home at abt 630am even before the sun rises and head to down Commonwealth to pick up Jiachen. If not for his company, I might have to make the trip to Batu Pahat myself... Sobs! We reached the Queenstreet terminal to check out the cost for a cab to our destination. And much to our unbelievably astonishment, the cab driver is charging us a bomb of 100 bucks! And there I was repeatedly asking him (the cab driver) and jiachen 100 ringgit ah? And no...Singapore dollar!! was the reply. Faints! Are we going to spend 100 Sing dollars on a one-way trip there??? No way man!!! So there we were boarding the $2.40 ONLY Spore-Johore Express Coach that will bring us across the causeway. The only hassle of going with the coach option was that we have to get up and down the buses and clearing the Spore and Johor custom, and I would gladly go with this option than to spend a freakin $100 on a stupid cab.    Alighting at the Larkin Terminal some 2 1/2 hrs later at 9plus, we were greeted by over-enthu coach operators. So scary, so...... #!@#$%. We ended up buying tickets from Trans-(Watever) at an astonishing price of...? RM7!...yes!that was how cheap it was! Boarding the coach at 10am, jiachen and I chatted abt almost anything and everything. As we chatted and the coach travels, I realise the air-conditioner was heating up. But well, the tot of RM7 just cools me off..ahah! In a breeze of 2hrs, we were in the town of Batu Pahat. What a quiet, nothing-fanciful kinda town. Buildings were torn, dilapidated or dull. Drains were carrying choked up stale black water with a very bad odour. Cars were driving past recklessly and seemingly Bo(3) Zeng(3) Hu(4)-ly. My first tots were, What a boring town it might be.  Yu and his cousin were at the bus terminal to pick us up. On seeing him, he looked tired and worned out. We went to have a quick lunch and proceeded to the parlour to pay our respect to their grandmother. There, we were asked to have another lunch prepared by the people there. Not wanting to reject their kind intention, jiachen and I had our 2nd round of lunch. burp..! After lunch, weiyu told me in detail what exactly happened to his grandmother. And as he was telling me, he cried. Feeling the heartbreaking him, I cried with him, hugging and comforting him. And all we could do, was to send as much prayers as possible to his beloved grandmother. I was, also for the first time, introduced to his aunts and uncles, and was told by one aunt how happy yu's grandmother was, telling them that Yu would be bringing me to go on a day's tour to their hometown sometime last year, for which we in the end did not go. I did not know that they were looking forward so much to see Weiyu bring his girlfriend, that is me, to Batu Pahat. His aunt teared, I teared too, consoling her at the loss of her beloved mother.  We had another round of food again at 5, this time, dinner. After which we rushed to board our 6 o'clock coach. This time a much better one with spacious seats and coooool air-con. And again after 2hrs, reaching the Larkin Terminal, we boarded bus 170 to the Johor checkpt, across the causeway, and to the Spore checkpt, and with much heartfelt feelings within us for the day's trip. Our total travel costs adds up to ONLY RM14 a person, a far cry from the $100 Sing for a one-way cab. My walltet thus still have loads of Ringgits left. And in my heart, I could only hope and pray that Yu will be strong and get over this difficult loss soon.  I reached home, feeling very full from supper. Yes! another meal which adds up to a total of 5 meals for the day. Breakfast, 2 lunches, 1 dinner, 1 supper. Had a quick hot shower, and slumped myself on bed and dozed off in a minute or two.

      My morning today was startled with a shocking news. Weiyu's grandma had met with a serious accident at her hometown in Batu Pahat, J.B. I was in total shock and couldn't believe what I heard from my mum.   Just last month we were having dinner at Yu's hse and we had some conversation with grandma asking me questions in hokkein like if I was also a hokkein and if I know how to speak the dialect. My impression of her was one of a loving grandmother, so cute, so elderly and nice old lady. In fact, looking at her brings me memories of my late grandma whom I lost when I was in Sec 2. Being the eldest grandson in the family, she dotes very much on Yu, and I believe Yu is also full of respect and love for her. This accident has since resulted in the departure of this loving grandma.   On hearing this tragic news, my first tots were Yu. He had just booked in camp ready for his reservist and how will he receive this news! I couldn't help but feel and empathise with the sudden loss of his beloved closed kin and how I wish I can just be there to comfort him. But I can't. I then made plans to make a trip to Batu to be there to support him and to pay my last respect. This, is just what I wanted to do, and this, is the very least I could do on my part.

      Muahahah! Today 12/5/2004, I have decided to start blogging. Why neh? I think it's becos I have read much blogs lately and feel the need to have a medium to note down all events be it happy, sad, sorrows, victories as well as wonderful memories of my daily life activites. Or could this eventually be my e-diary? Perhaps..!

      Work on wednesday was ughhhhhhh. have been coffing n coffing the whole day. Not to mention the agony of facing the dread looking old mgr who, I think toks without sense, wisdom, intelligence and compassion. Been wondering, has he no brain or wat?!  Met up with xuehua, jiachen and guofeng for supper. We went to Chomp Chomp and had a feast of satay, wings, sotong mee, sting ray and carrot cakes. I had a mini booze wif jiachen too. We ordered a Heineken, and wat a bliss to have tt with those food. Its heaven! Jus love sitting around, toking koks, feasting wif junk foods, with a beer on hand. Aha! By the time I reached home abt 11.00pm, I was in the Gong-State! My head was bobbling. I did a quick gongyo, and fell onto my bed in concussion!

      Rainy rainy...on this Tuesday morning. How I loved this weather. Sitting on my desk in front of my pc, listening to the split-splattering of the falling rain. Nice! Its just like winter, so cold, so cosy, nudging in my wollen sweater.  Its been 3 days and I have not hear a single call from weiyu. Sometimes I wonder why is it so difficult for him to have his hp auto-roamed? The tot of it really vexes me cos it has resulted in me not being able to call him, and he not being able to call me! But again, if he really will ever think of giving me a ring, he can always find a public phone to do that.   In my office now, nothing to do. Just some stupid letter writing and shitty kinda things for me to do. This is plainly to say a job that gives me not a least satisfaction, achievement and enjoyment. Not to say that I have to also face a bladdy b*****d mgr who thinks he is such a wonderful capable boss. Fancy him giving me an instruction which I mis-interpeted, and have him saying to me in a psycho sicko manner that Young pple nowadays, cannot even understand simple instructions, in those vocal manner that I really feel like slapping him. And I nearly replied him that, Old pple nowadays, dun give proper understandable instructions, and instead blame young pple when they mis-interpreted it. Kanasai! Oh...not forgetting he even attempted to praise my letter writing skills saying how much improved they were. Dun kanasai lah! As if I really will si(1) han(4) the little f**king statement i call 'praise'. Pls lah..writing a f**king good letter very liao(3) bu(4) qi(3) meh? *rolls eyes*  Oh. Not to mention some colleagues here, getting all fretted up over a few pieces of ugly-looking scale-dropping dull fishes. Pls lah.... Wau lau eh! Nothing better to do or wat? I really cannot imagine myself getting all worried over those supposedly 'koi' looking fishes. Faints. Its not that I am cruel or watever, but I feel that over-reacting is not necessary. Well unless those are real kois worth hundreds, thousands or even much more dollar kois or fishes. Crap. Well for now, I think the only pet I can get so overly-anxious of is my cute little brown hare at home, which I have cared for the past 5 yrs now. That, is wat I call worth getting over-reacted abt. Cos that is an animal that is warm-blooded, can run, can react, can notice your presence. Now to mention it, I realise I dun give a heck abt cold-blooded kinda species. Maybe!  How I wish pple around me can realise their childishness, their p-brainess, and how nerve-wrecking their f**ked character are. Nonetheless, at times, it is up to each individual self to realise this. For me too, I am realising my short-coming character and attitudes too. Aha! =p

      The J-train project training was definitely the least of what I had expected. My zone is combined with the NTU south region. & guess wat? Only ONE memeber turned up! & guess wat? tt member was brought down by me! & guess wat? this member is my brother! Gosh! The Ics didn't contact them or they didn't want to come down, or wat? Of the 8 in the Clementi-South R.-FDSD grp, 2 are region FD Ics, 2 are FD Ics, 2 are trainers, 1 is NTU help out,  and the only 1 member, my brother. I was speechless. Freak!!! The Ics are not contacting their members AT ALL for any meetings! And if the IC is not present at the meetings, dun expect to see their members there either. Now I really wonder n wonder if I should really go into this Future Division Group. *This is a real head-shaking in disagreement kinda thing* Apparently we do see some FD members, but from other zones, and I should stress that the figures is a disappointment. I believe that if the Ics really do put in more effort in encouraging their members to join in this event, we will definitely see more from the FD side! But..but...hai! Better give me the contact list and I will do the contacting instead! *Rolls eyes* And the committee kept insisting: We must achieve victory. We must achieve victory. By the look on the way it was yesterdae, Freak Me! Not that I tramp down on my own region/zone, but if we were toking abt achieving victory, certain protocols must be achieved. Certain steps must be done. Certain attitudes must be changed. And certain mental thinking must be changed too! We can't be sitting around and expecting tt certain *bla* to start executing itselves, are we? *faints* This is a total disaster!  Another day of the week. A tiring day.

      Reached home 20mins before 12.00am. Real tired but happy and full from the roti prata suppper with my dear dear weiyu. keke. The prata was yummy. We had mushroom cheese prata, ko-song prata, a super spicy mee goreng, & a milo dinosaur! Woah the milo dinosaur is a MUST try! A recommendation by jia jun last friday. This drink is Very Heaty, Very Thick, Very Milo, Very Huge, & Very Tasty. Cost $2 a cup though.  Jus finished a planning for the Community Charity Run training to be held tomoro. The FD will be combining with NTU for all the trainings, and we are looking forward to the FD kids teaming up with their big brothers & sisters, wondering how the fusion and get-along-together will be like. I remained much silent thru-out the planning though, cos I wasn't at the kick-off mtg on the 15th 2 wks ago, thus didn't have any expectations of wat is to come. Jus couldn't think of any suggestions so remaining silent is the best thing I could do. ha ha. Moreover, I will be away for my Europe holiday for 2 wks in June, thereby missing 2 trainings. And there will only be 4 trainings before the actual run on 4th July, which makes me able to attend only 2 of the 4 trainings! Wonder wonder.... Tomoro's training mtg is not going to be a vigourous one. As it is a kick-off 1st training for the students, we have decided to just have a relaxing and fun evening. All of us in the committee are just looking forward to the number of students who will be turning up tomoro. Will the number be big or scarce? Ermmmm........ We shall C! =p

      Jus realise tt I haven't been updating my blog since wednesday. Ha Ha. Well well, let's see...  My Thurs, Fridae, and my weekends were spent to maximum fulfillment. Not a single day was spent worthlessly, and not a singhle hour was spent aimlessly! Ndp trainings on Thurs and Sat nites were exhausting BUT great! Every participants' sincere effort were greatly felt especially on Saturdae's training at the National Stadium. We had all put in our 101% feelings and vigour into the dance steps, and everyone was trying to be as sharp as possible in every formation transisition, as if silently telling all those present in the stadium that We Can Do It! SSA Can Do It! Our Youth Division Can Do It! Ha Ha Ha...!  Besides the vigourous Ndp trainings, my Acapella group is also training for our performance for the 6th June Soka Arts Festival to be held at the Singapore Conference Hall. Now to mention, our Acapella group is form by: Jia Jun, Decong, San San, Zelie, Ting Ting, Victor, Weiyu, and Me! We are trying our very best in giving our best in the coming performance. And we can definitely achieve tt! It was really fun. All the practices, all the singing, all the sound and noise making. Ahaaha BOOM BOOM BOOM! =)  Yesterdae was also the New Paper Big Walk event. Me, my mum, and a few others took part in it. Woke up at 5.00am, but by the time we reached the Kallang area, the roads are blocked! The car can't get in, and we have frens who were lost and wating for us near the Kallang theatre. Left wif only 1 choice, I got off the car and wif quick pace and even jogs, I began my journey towards the Oasis from the Kallang main road. And freak did I realise how long the stretch of road was. Curving and twist turning here and there. And as I jog towards where they were, memories of the March Poly 50 came into my mind. How sweet! My Big Walk morning however, was started way before the actual event begun. After all the running to find the frens, I walked back again to find my mum, and walked back AGAIN to the National Stadium. I have already completed my Big Walk from all these walking around finding people and all. By the time it was 7.30am, I felt my body already cooled down from all the 'exercises' and pespiration. Joining them in the walk nonetheless, my mum and I walked half the route and gave up. I felt mentally and physically exhausted once I am in the car and was off into sleep mode......all the way home, and at home, I slept all the way till noon. K.O.

      Ndp was unexplainably great yesterday man! It seems like every movements and formations are fixed, and that all we need to do now is to memorise memorise & memorise and  groove  to the dance movements & remember our formation markers, which at kranji camp, the markers are all covered by grass patches and us having use our fingers to flip open the green grasses. We did only 2 run-thrus today, and the rest of the time with our trainers telling us some changes in the last few formations *scratch head*. In all training was all too great, fun and much too enjoy. A pity that I will be going on my holiday next week for 16 days! Thus missing 5 trainings!!! Jus hope they won't kick me out though... Ha Ha! Rushed down for my Acapella practice with Victor immediately after our Ndp. We didn't even wait for the encouragement session to end and there we were on our feet catching a cab. Panting panting. Thank goodness nowadays cabs are equipped with good air-conditioning system and I can cool down calmly while travelling to san san's hse. Ha!   Acapella practice was great yesterday too! All smooth, soothing, and as we all hum & sing with our hearts & souls, trying to produce that ultimately moving voices we have. We had decided to name ourselves the OOPS group. Out Of Point group. Coz while singing, we would always of out the blue start saying crap-like things, and out of the point subjects...hahaha especially jia jun! Crap guy!   Was home abt 11.30pm. Showered. TV. Bed. Zzzzz....

      Woah! This thursday morning feels so much like a monday to me. haha! For a week I have not been updating my blog. Too busy. Too tired. Reaching home almost 12am every nite for the past week. I'm half worned out but definitely feeling superb.  Been damn busy with my FD J-train project, Ndp trainings and acapella practices. Recalling....   Last Thursday  Ndp practice after work. Trainers got us YWDs to try out new cool stunts. We did a mini tower in groups of 4. Yes I was the bottom one coz if I were too be the 'top' lady, I think my base ladies will all be crushed by me. Ahah! The try-out was great though my thighs ached a tweeny little bit. Keke. We did the fan-like formation too. Again of cos, I was one of those doing the supporting thing. And while our trainer was getting us to try this stunt out, I kinda cracked some crazy jokes and my frens and I were laughing our heads off like mad girls on the loose. AHAHAHAHAH.....This is cool!   Friday  It was acapella practice after work in a rainy thunderstorm. We all gathered at Sansan's place and begin our battle to polish and learn old and new songs for our 6/6 performance. And it seems like making noise is easy. It is NOT. Especially singing to the ears of Pros like jiajun & san san. Kekeke...   Saturday  Had a company bowling competition today. Nothing much to say abt this coz I play rather badly. Bo bian. No skill is like that one. Plus weiyu made me so angry, thus affecting my bowling mood. Ha! No Ndp trg todae. Went for the district's 4Div mtg and heard a few interesting and funny testimonials. And it's home after that. ....   Sunday  Woke up damn early today. Met the J-train trainers for a route recee at 7.30am. Kaile, from NTUSD picked us up at Boon Lay Mrt and ferried us to NTU. And little did I realise we were going to run that much! We receed routes of more than 3 kilometres. And when I say recee, I meant we RAN, JOG, WALKED. After everything, I was OUT! Totally OUT, Worn OUT, & nearly Knocked OUT! We finalised everything at Scc, tying down most of the big and little details in the cool air-conditioned, full-speed faned Pine room. By 2pm we were a bunch of hungry tired boys and girls. Went for lunch, back home to recover, and Zzzzz....   Monday  Wat a great Mondae! I started my first day of the week with great joy. Left home early and went for my morning tea at JE (this will be my routine from today on), not forgetting to mention, armed with the current book I am reading: NHR Vol 2. And by the time I reach office to start work, I was already feeling super perked up, charged with Sensei's fighting spirit and joy on how he fought his victorious battles. My morning was marvellous. And my day seemed to pass so quickly, so happily. After work, it was Acapella practice again, and we had like 6 more days before our performance. I can feel 1 butterfly in my stomach now. We can do it! It was supper after practice, home by midnite, and dreams here I come.   Tuesday  Woke up feeling happy, knowing tomoro is a public holiday and today is last day of work. Old boss had a gold tournament today, and this adds to my satisfaction and joy of spending my marvellous Tues-Day. After work, it was Acapella again. Had supper again after the practice, and home to bed. Yawn...   Wednesday  Meeting with the trainers this early morning. I was late. Was supposed to meet at Outram Mrt at 9.30am, but I was still at Chinese Garden station then. Msg-ed Chuimin, our FD region IC cum J-train chief trainer that I was be late, and telling them to proceed to the place where we were supposed to go while I find my way there. The mrt was fast today, I was at Outram in 20mins, and phew! Chuimin was there waiting for me and Yee Mun (another FD IC/trainer). If she wasn't there, I would be walking towards chinatown, where the YMD's hse is at the Tiong Bahru area. Yup! I nearly headed the opposite direction. The trainers' mtg today was great. Tied down an even more specific agenda, a bit of argument and ideas flying around in all directions. Jokes, laughters, discussions. And by the end of everything, we had managed to all agree to the same thing, and looking forward to our 1st J-train training on Saturday. Went to meet weiyu after my planning, and after his gym core training. We had a quick lunch prepared at his hse, and off again we were to sansan's hse for the Acapella practice. On this practice to date, I should say we can almost sing to the chords and notes we want. But again, some parts still ended up in out-of-the-tune chords. Awwwwww.... Are we going to make it right?? Faints..

      Here I am now in Manchester. Arrived here by car at a late 5pm. Travelling for more than 8hrs since beginning our journey from London at 9.30am, we cut thru a few motorways to arrive at Chesterfield, Derbyshire for lunch with Emile's grand-dad first. It was his 86th birthday. Aunt Bina brought us to this old couple's hse which looked like a small cottage with gardens, porch, and a mini garage. Meeting the 2 old folks, they were like an old english couple. Their accent and the way they talk to us, it's so english so cultured so mannered. One word is all I can think of to describe them: that is, So English!!! They present a typical oldish English mannerism. That's Emile's Grandparents, Bina's in-laws, and Terry's parents.  Eric, the grand-dad, took us for lunch at a restaurant in Chesterfield that serves western food. Bina said that was his fav restaurant and his favorite dish would be the Gammon with pineapple. I had a smothered chicken with bacon, fat fries, and vege. Salty it was but alrite. I would have prefered Jack's Place or Meditterean food served at Brewerks though. Didn't expect the standard of western food in this western country to be way below our spore standard. My dad was even commenting his fish & chips was the worst he had ever tried. After lunch it was on the road again, bina the driver, and me the navigator.  Arriving in Manchester, at my sis hse, we were freezing. Wind so strong and chilling, and I was only in my nike shorts, OP tee and nike shoe. Getting into the hse, I slumped onto my sis bed feeling all too tired for anything. For time in spore was 11pm then, my shutting down time.  After an hr's rest, sis took us for dinner at Curry Mile. Curry Mile is a long stretch of road where many indian restaurants were. We had dinner at Thrills & Grills, and sumptous is all I could describe. Mixed grill and cod fish all grilled to perfection, &, spinach and mutton curry making the best gravy for our rice. Drink was Oh So Heaven, thick mango mixed with yogurt and milk, making it a nothing-can-be-more-perfect drink. Oooooo...  Sis took us around after dinner. To the Manchester United stadium, the prime posh districts, and to her university of salford. By then, I was already semi-conscious. I could move no more. Took onli very few pictures there wif my all shagged out face. Time was then 9pm (Spore 4am). My dream time. Back home, I was out till now.  Manchester just seems to be a more lively activity filled town compared to London.

      I am now in London on this bright Friday morning. Time is now 530am & already it seemed like it's 10am.       Touched down London Heathrow Airport at 3.30pm (Spore time 10.30pm) yesterdae. The flight was tiring. 11.5 hrs straight. Had 2 meals, 1 snack, plus lotsa drinks & peanuts onboard. Rest of the flight sees me reading, watching the in-flight movies, & dozing off. My bro & I shared the row of 3 seats by the window, making the flight journey not at all an agony. It was definitely a pleasant journey.    Clearing the english custom wasn't at all a breeze. It was pissed. Custom lady asking craps like:"Who am I travelling with? To London for wat? Staying for how long? Till when? Where's my return ticket?" It really siao. So I let her see my ticket, which is simply a piece of pathetic A4 sized home computer print-out paper. It's an e-ticket I told her. *rolls eye* Proceeding on, we were stopped again by another custom person. This time, an old fat guy. Asked if we brought in any foodstuffs? My dad replied,"No..Not at all." Where in actual fact, one of the big luggage has got all the ingredients for making Ba-Zhang, from my big aunt for my 2nd aunt. My brother was then there telling me in front of the custom guy,"Have wat! We got food." And I was there staring him hard, giving him the Pls know when to ask or say certain things at the right moment kind of look. He practically asked me that right in front of that fat man! Faints! And one thing for sure, Heathrow Airport is not at all comparable to our Singapore Changi Airport. Not at all.   Aunt Bina (2nd Aunt) & Emile (Cousin) picked us up. Then it was back to Emile's apartment to rest & wash up b4 going for dinner. Dinner was at a Chinese restaurant. The chinese food again, saw a lower standard compared to our chinese menu back in Singapore. And it wasn't cheap. Travelling around London in the hired Ford Mondeo, except for old architectures, palaces, castles, museums, & gardens, it is more gardens to see. The buildings here all seemed to have the same designs, squarish walls with square windows everywhere. Most of them are bricked and they were all within 1 metre from the main road, so narrow it was. It's though London is an old English country where you can find all the peaceful surrounding, filled wif Bird Rain Flower Fragrance (Niao Yu Hua Xiang). After dinner, we arrived at a garden in Greenswich where we saw famous River Thames and the London prime district. By then, time was around 8.30pm. The sky however seemed like it was just 6.30pm in the evening. The sun had not even set. And apparently the northen hemisphere sees day longer during summer, setting sun at 10pm and rising sun at 4am. By 11pm, I was OUT! K.O! My tired eyes are failing me! Couldn't hold them wide open anymore, and I was mentally drained. Drained from the difference in hours, and if I were in Singapore, I would already be in bed. Singapore is 7 hours ahead. Zzzzz.....  Reaching home, I was in bed within 10mins. Yes. I was that tired, physically & mentally.  Alrite. Time now is 6.00am (Spore 1.12pm). Going dwnstairs for my breakfast. And it's off on the road again to Manchester at 9.00am.

      Watched Day After Tomorrow with ah-yu last nite. A very gd movie.. Having moments of tension, comical & anxiety. The story plot is one of its kind, alerting people of the disastrous effects of global warming. Frightening.   As we were watching the 9.55pm show, I had a $24.90 haircut at JP. My fringe was getting in my way, so irritating when it just falls across my bright big eyes. So I just got them trimed & now it's cool. Dinner was fantastic too. We had steak salmon & Roast beef. And was it becoz they were closing the shop for the day which explains why our makan portions were enormous! Ah-yu was given 4 pieces of roast beef and I was given a huge plate of potato topped with creamy based gravy & a big piece of steak salmon. Sumptous sumptous. A bit too filling though.

      My weekend was Grrreat!   Saturday's J-training though so-so onli, it was tiring but mentally rejuvenating. Attendance was pathetic, seeing more SDs than FDs. Ask why? I jus feel that the FD Ics are jus not doing enuff, or is it really the situation where our youngsters are jus simply not interested in such community activities? Again, my zone sees onli 1 memeber, that is my brother. No other YWDs or YMDs from FD. Jus my brother. Yo Bro! Keep up wif tt spirit boy! Attended quanquan & annie's wedding dinner at the harbourfront. Food was, ermmm, o...k. Drinking the shark's fin seemed like drinking starches. The cold dish and chicken was good, and the noodle too. All close frens sitting round the same table saw us all not feeling at all pai seh to gourge down, and have more than one servings of the food. Ha! The nite was all joke crackings, laughters and more laughters. We were all exhilarated to our highest spirit. My dinner was however interrupted by a call from brother saying he fell into a deep drain, hurting himself very badly. Finishing the noodle, weiyu & I rushed down Sentosa to find him having an extremely disgusting deep open wound below his knee. Bloody! It must have hurt. But brother was courageous enuff not to cry, perhaps to save his pretty handsome face infront of his classmates who were around. Ha! Took him to a 24hrs family hospital, which I would not go again. The doctor's and nurse's service was plainly unprofessionally bad. Ask if any applied medication is needed? Answer was No Need. Ask if I will be given any alcohol or medicine to wash the wound? Answer No Need. Ask if any medicine to stop infection or watever? Answer No Need. Crap. All the doctor asked the male nurse was to wash up that disgusting wound and wrap it up. tsk. And these simple, look see look see at the wound acts cost me $65! faints. Reached home after that and it's lectures & more lectures from my parents at my brother. Poor boy.. fell badly & still gotta endure the harsh unsympathetic lecturings.  Sunday was Woah! Picked up san san, decong, jiajun & ting ting. Jiajun was sick today. We headed down tiong bahru market for lunch and was down at the singapore conference hall by 12.30pm. Acapella practice was done quickly. We were all nervously tensed. Practice was soothing. Right chords, notes and voices. Mic test was done at 1.30pm & woah woah woah it was uneasy. We couldn't hear our own voices coming out from the speakers, and all we hear were echos buuzzing round our ear drums. Gosh! Time is near. Before we could continue to practice and test out with mics and speakers, it was time for our real performance. A performance where we had been practicing for the past 2 months. Everyone sang and groove to their own parts. Applause was, ermmm, not so thunderous after all. But well, we did jus our very best, and, ermm, we aren't professionals. Ha! A few of us loitered round the exhibition hall, strolling and crapping. After san san went on to prepare for her evening performance, decong, zelie & Ah-ku headed down harbourfront for a game of pool. Then it was dinner, me back to the conference hall, and meeting my parents & bro for the evening performacne. And boy was the performance grrreat! If encore was allowed, they would have to do so countless times for the nite. Today 6/6 saw a successful 2nd Soka Arts Festival this year. Well done all!  Monday. Work day. Tired. Met up wif san san & decong after work to catch a movie. We watched Shrek 2 at west mall. This movie is a stress-reliever! The cartoon characters were Oh So Cute! It is definitely a movie worth watching after a blardy hard day's work. Cool! San san says she will be buying the vcds, yo must let me loan it for pirating it yeah.. Ha ha ha! Back home, I stayed up till the wee hours of 2am, editing my resume and typing some job cover letters. Awww... waking up this morning, I was one big panda dragging myself to work. And I still have 9 more hours to knocking off.

      Manchester.Statford.Oxford.London.  Road trip for the day begun from Manchester at 10:00am. Left sis's hse and headed down to Birmingham, Statford armed with a 15 year old road map. Aunt was the driver & me the trip's navigator, and all stresses was inevitable. I was then reminded of Angelyn who was my navigator back on our road trip in perth 2 years ago. For sure now do I understand how she felt, the ocassional needs to bend your head to read the maps, keeping look outs for road signs, as well as the welfare needs of the driver. Can't take a half-time doze unless the driver wants rest, and damn is it mentally tiring. =p  We arrived at Statford Upon The Avon where Anne, William Shakespeares wife lives. Its an old cottage with beautiful sceneries and gardens around, definitely a perfect view of photography. Ah-ku me bought more souveneirs from the gift shop there, and its for you to guess wat I have bought. Ha! And again it was, birds, flowers, and butterflies before we were on the road again.   Navigation to Oxford was a minor hic-cup. I got lost looking at the map, and wrong turns were made. Round and round we drove looking for signs that shows us the light to enlightenment. Impatient passenger got pissed but please understand our agony, or would you rather you drive? !!!!  Wisdom got in us soon after and we found our way on the right motorway to the Oxford University where old beautiful magnificent buildings came greeting us. They were oh-so awesome! So old! So... speechless. So this is where the famous unversity is and this is where our Oxford dictionary we have been using since young originated. Or was it? Aha!

      Was up & awake at 6am (spore 1pm).  Saturday yesterdae for all i could say is the best of the 3 days since here. Dim sum at chinatown was delicious. The ambience was oh-so warmth. We had lots of it but I wasn't really tt full. My body had been burning fats at a faster rate than normal due to the cold weather here. I am getting hungry faster than usual and could eat more. But dun worry, I will make sure they don't effect me physically, or would they? Aha! Sis brought us to shop around the Manchester city centre after lunch. This is a place like the orchard road in spore. So many pple. So crowded. So happy. I bought myself a sweater with 5pounds. It was a gd buy. SGD 15 ONLI. The city centre was an interesting place. We passed a weekend market machiam like a pasar malam which instead of cheong CDS, curry pok, fishballs, they sold cheeses, fruit jams, fruity liquers, and some other english foods. The stall sellers were mostly old, nice & friendly English pple, laughing & speaking oh-so politely, comically and wif all grace. Shopped for almost 3hours & we head back home to prepare dinner. Well actually not me preparing, but my sis, aunt, a spanish hsemate, n a mexican. I was up in my sis room taking an evening nap cos I cannot dong already. spore time was then 12am!!! My sis had invited her mexican fren for dinner at her hse coz she wanted to introduce her to her 2 polish hsemates who came to Manchester onli 2 weeks ago and didn't know anyone here. This mexican girl, Alex, prepared a mexican dish. And it was oh-so yummy with avocado mixed wif dunno wat n wrapped in cheese roti-prata look alike. Spanish boy, Nickale, made his spanish omelette. Aunt with her frozen roast duck & squid. And sis with her mushroom. Dinner was Sumptous, and it was like a Ma Han Quan Xi, so many cultured dishes, so delicious. And yes, I ate alot too! Sinned! But never mind la.     Alex invited me to join her frens at a pub after dinner. And we headed down gay village     where sis n her fren showed me around town. This village, as the name speaks, is where the gays meet. Saw a few gays hugging, & dancing erotically. What a sight! Pple were shouting everywhere, toking loudly, and a few behaving rowdily. It's like the whole of Manchester is out on this saturday nite, not sleeping at all, and jus boozing the nite away. Past midnite, we headed down to alex's frens hse for another round of drink. There, we met more spanishes, and how affectionate is their way of greeting you. Guys or girls, their way to say hello is a left kiss & a right kiss. Yea. We took pictures, and these pple are simply fun.   Left the party at abt 1am. Back home, it was a quick wash up n Pomp! On my bed to see my dreams....  And here I am on this bright Sunday morning, all so freshed and ready to head back to London where I will be starting my Europe tour tomoro.

      I am back from my long holiday! After 12 long hours of flight, the plane finally touched down at Changi Airport at 6pm. We left the Heathrow airport at 11pm (Spore 6am), and the hours spent in the sky wasn't too bad. After getting into the altitude of 39000m, after supper was served, I went into my on off sleep mode with headphones plucked tightly to my ears, listening to Jay Chou's Ye Hui Mei album. Before I knew, I was asleep for almost 6 hours, that is half the journey. Yea man!  Breakfast was served. Food wasn't too bad, quite tasty in fact. I watched 2 movies: Butterfly effect & Dirty dancing, and very quickly, it's time to land. My 12 hours up in the sky doesn't feel at all that it was that long. Ha ha!  Back home now, feeling abit groggy and tired. I have finished unpacking all stuffs and l had my gifts and soveniers all laid out neatly on my table, and the chocolates on my chair.  Okie...going for a quick shower now and out for supper later.  =p

      Just finished lunch prepared by bina. Had instant noodle and she is now preparing bai-zhan chicken for dinner later.  In the morning, we had a stroll along the Roamn marketplace along Ordell Road. The weather wasn't very good. Strong chilly winds made us all freezing out there and all of us were walking with our cold hands tucked tightly into watever pockets we had on us. This Roman market is machiam like a mini pasar malam where you can find some fake Gucci pants and some other cheap clothings with prices ranging from £1 to £10. We then headed to a mega-mart belonging to famous American Wal-mart where we did more last minute shopping for more chocolates, and I bought for myself a little white cute & sweet ****** (secret) for less than £10, which is much more cheaper than if I were to buy it in Singapore. Ha!  Reaching home, now, I have already finished packing my suitcase, duffle bag & the backpack I will be carrying with me. All neat, tidy and heavy. I will have to take the tube, that is the london's mrt, to heathrow airport later, with my bro. Why? Becoz bina's car wouldn't be able to take the weight of 5 heavy adults + 1 boy with 5 super heavy suitcases! That explains the need for me and bro to be on the tube. Emile will be meeting us at the tube station though, so it's alrite and we will not be losing our way in any chance.  My feelings for my long europe holiday is happy, enjoyable, fun, yet feeling neutral at the same time. dunno y lei! I enjoyed my europe trip to belgium, germany, austrai, switzerland, italy and france, meeting the the different kinds of people in my tour group, as well as the different culture of people travelling together for the one full week. I forgot to mention that in my tour group, there were these 2 young indians who were bro n sis who were pissed with me, my sis and 2 other frens we met in the tour. They kept making snide pissing smiles towards us and whispering supposedly sacarstic remarks to each other and stealing glances at our mini group. We were pissed too at them, and my sis just sweared at them in spanish, and bet they didn't understand wat it was. Cool Ha! Not that we didn't try being compassionate, but it was just too difficult to achieve that at that point of time. =p Europe, europe, london, london... I think all are wonderful memories but the best would be the delicious dinner prepared by Terry in dartmouth as well as the little interesting garden he has. Ermmm, well, life in london is slow. Unlike the hectic life in stressful fast-paced Singapore. Over here, people do things at cool slow normal pace that they can handle individually. The cool weather adds to the goodness in living here, making everyone's temperature and temperament kept at the minimum whenever possible.   Though this english country is beautiful with a cool wonderful weather, if given a choice to choose, I would choose to live in perth than in london. Perth has the more relaxing surrounding that I love, having a busy town area as well as having peaceful greens and natural surroundings. There's life as well as moments for relaxation in perth, waking up to chirping birds, and sipping wine in the evening after work. Then again, I am longing to go back to Singapore, missing so many things there, my bunny, my yu, my ndp trainings, my room. It just contradicts so much that when I am at home, I dread home, and now that I am in London, I miss home. Well, maybe it's just bcoz I do enjoy my holiday in London but not the life here, or perhaps I am on holiday travelling with my family but not with frens, or simply becoz if I were to be in perth hoildaying instead I wouldn't be missing my home that much. Humans just have CONTRADICTING nature.  Alrite. Going for my shower here and boarding my plane at 22.15pm.

      Alrite....alrite! Time now is 8.50am (Spore 3.50pm), Thursday 24/6/2004. I have since spent my 2 full weeks in europe and back to singapore I will be tonite, arriving homeland on Friday 25/5/2004, 6.00pm.  I just woke up after a long nite of travelling from Dartmouth, Devon back to London. The 4 hrs on the road was agony for me. Squeezing in bina's tiny crampped little car, I tried making my the journey as comfortable as it could be, trying to turn and find the right position for best comfort while trying to sleep thru it. And finally after hours, we reached London at 2.30am!   Tuesday 22/6  Went to Taplow court, SGI-UK this morning. Saw how big and beautiful the gaikan in London was. It is a castle with beautiful huge garden, and was previously a Lord's residence before SGI bought it over. Japanese guide Masako showed us around, and we were shown around the castle's hall where sometimes gakkai conferences and receiving important guests were held, the lord's smoking room, as well as some rooms on the 2nd floor. The castle's original furnitures, pictures and layout were left untouched so as to preserve what it was and will be. This gaikan is simply B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!  In the evening, after bina is back from work, we were off on the road to her house in Dartmouth, Denver, where her husband Terry is waiting to meet us after a long 24 years. Thr road journey was frightening! Bina's driving was freaking me out. Turning and switching lanes in a manner that I am clinging on to safety belts or anything I could hold on tightly too. Trying to sleep as I was, I couldn't. My doze was always snapped out to sudden jerks and swerves, and I was getting all paranoid, especially at the car travelling speed of 100mph (140kph) and accompanied with heavy downpours. We arrived at dartmouth at 2am, and we were all tired..!   Wednesday 23/6  Today was a great day at dartmouth. My morning was greeted with Terry's beautiful little garden where he showed us around. There were so many little plants and trees, all vegetable plants, and fruit trees. I was so excited to see so many strawberries and raspberries on the plants that me and bro immediately went around plucking the fruits and eating them on the spot. It was SWEET & YUM YUM it was! By the end of the day, the trees that used to be green with small little red fruits, was now plainly green and botak with no more fruits left. But well, terry says he was saving those fruits for us anyway. ke ke ke. We then walked around dartmouth and this place was a nice place too. Being just at the river mouth, we could see many yatchs and fat seagulls sailing and flying around. Bro and me got crazy and started posing stupidly. We saw many dogs being walked around and we were like Wah..so cute lei! This afternoon, bina brought us to have a real english breakfast at Al Resco. The meal was good. 1 sausage, 2 tomatoes, 2 bacons, 2 eggs. But it cost 4.95pounds! Ex! Then it was back home for rest while terry prepares dinner for us.  Dinner was sumptous! Pure 4 course italian dinner, having wild mushroom spagehtti, scallops, John dory fillet which is super fresh, salads and aspharagus, and then apple crumble with double cream for dessert. All prepared, cooked and baked with fresh ingredients by terry. I really enjoyed this super delicious dinner and boy am I hungry now thinking about it now. Oh forgetting to mention, Eugene joined us for dinner too coz he is staying in Totnes near Dartmouth, and terry drove him here for the family dinner. He is so grown up now. 21yrs old and was told he is engaged to his girlfriend now. Hmmmm... Interesting. He used to be just a little boy when I last met him in 1997, and he is like so matured now, even the way he speaks. =p  After dinner, it was goodbye to terry and eugene, goodbye to dartmouth, and off we were on our 4 hrs journey back to London.

      Was back in London this evening, arriving only at 5.30pm. **TIRED** Today was a tiring travelling day, starting with my coach journey from the Paris hotel at 8.00am, making the whole mondae travelling hours clocked at a shocking 10hours straight. From Paris, it was 4 hrs coach to Calais port to board the ferry back to the Dover Port in U.K, from U.K it was 2 hrs coach to London, and from London it was 1 hr back to Emile's house. In between, my tour group 4420 was delayed at the English custom with their ever-weekly-changing custom rules and procedures. We had to wait for the 2pm ferry, missing the 1.15pm scheduled for us, and Manwell, our tour director was obviously annoyed with the English. Not forgetting to mention, he is a portugese who speaks 6 different languages: English, French, Spanish, Portugese, Language X, Language Y. Cool yeah? Ha Ha. But he's very sissy, age 35 yrs, not bad looking, studied international affairs in uni, worked in office env for 6 mths and quit, now as a tour director with Cosmos for 6 yrs, and we are all speculating he's GAY!  For a week, I haven't been getting access to the Internet, with only a few minutes while I was in Innsbruck, Austria. And my week was well, full of stories to tell. =p   Monday 14/6  Woke up early today. We had to reach the Coffi Hotel at 8.30am to meet the rest of the Cosmos passengers also heading for the Dover port. After all passport procedures, off we were on the coach for an hr and a half, reaching Dover just around 12pm. Boarding the posh star cruise like ferry, we were welcomed by 2 decks of restuarants, pubs, casino machines, tax-free perfume and wine shops. It was awesome! So posh, so classy, so hungry! Lunch at the international food court was $$$$ EXPENSIVE for it was in Sterling Pounds! It was delicious though, especially the desserts. On the last deck, seagulls were flying everywhere and everyone was drawing out cameras and snapping these birds. I was one of them, with my memory card having 20 snaps of flying birds, for which I had to delete all but one, the best of the best bird pic I took. =p  Met our Cosmos tour director, Manwell, at the Calais Port in France, and off we were to our first destination, Brussell, one of the main cities in Belgium. Was on the sickening coach for 3hrs, and our first stop in Brussell was the Atomium. Forgot what this Atomium was all abt, for I was already burnt from the long hrs on the road, but it sure was something to do with chemistry, with its atom like structure. This structure was magnificent, and all I could do was take pictures with it with zero idea on wat the damn thing was. After checking into the hotel, we met a filipina couple and a young american travelling alone in our tour group, and we off went, hopping onto the Brussell's train metro, and exploring the city centre that welcomed us with its all too grand, ancient, awesome, magnificent looking building strucutures! When we stepped right in the centre square, all of us gasp in astonishment like WAH....!!!! pausing for seconds b4 recovering and maintaining our composure. The ancient civilization maintained structures will be memories. It's not something we can ever find in singapore. Standing in the centre square with the chilling weather, its as if we were so tiny, with all the building structures surrounding us, and all we could do was stand right there, absorbing and remembering watever feelings and admiration from these beautiful presentation standing right before us. No shopping for us coz the shops are all closed by the time we reached.   Tuesday 15/6  Morning call was arranged at 6.00am! Lugguge outside the room door at 6.30am. Breakfast from 6.30am to 7.30am. These would be wat it will be for the week's morning everyday. Breakfast today was pathetic! Bro, sis and I were late for breakfast. Thinking it would be buffet anyway, we were confronted with a nearly empty breakfast table, eating wats left of a few pieces of hams, cheese, drips of coffe, and...and...that's abt it! The hotel staffs were not even bothered at all to refill the empty trays. My morning was an anti-climax.  It was a morning city tour of Brussels, where Manwell took us shopping. Here I bought loads of chocolates at branded chocolate shop Godiva, well after all Belgium is one of the best known country that makes chocoalates. *winks*  It was then off to Frankfurt, Germany. Our tour programme arranged for us to be put on a Rhine cruise, cruising down the River Rhine that has many castles along the way, vineyards and old pubs and bars. It was a boring cruise ride. Bought myself a German corlando beer to sipped thru the journey, and it was smooth and good. Recommended by Manwell. Along the cruise ride, I saw many caravan campers too, something which I had only read abt in school books abt the gypsies and their caravans. Here, pple rent caravans for short camping trips, parking their vehicle at permitted camping sites, fishing along the river, showering and having their meals in the vans.  The hotel we were checked into for the night was good hotel. Big rooms, big beds, big toilets. I was freaked out though while washing my face, opening my eyes to find myself washing and rinsing in yellowish murky water. It was so very disgusting I had to find mineral water to rinse myself in it. Apparently it was due to the pressure system of the pipe that causes the water to be in such state. It was only after some time of continuous water flow that my room got clear water coming back on the running tap.   Wednesday 16/06  Breakfast: Hams, Salami, Cheese, Bread. Our first stop was Rottenburgh, Germany. The weather was very chilly cold today. *brrrrr....* This beautiful city has nice cafes with very cool atmosphere, and many many different kind of interesting shops selling many many different kind of interesting stuffs. There is one christmas shop selling many different kinda christmas stuffs, jus anything you want to get for christmas, there is nothing you cannot find in there. Stepping into this shop was like stepping into wonderland, and it felt just like it was christmas then. And I could almost imagine if it was winter and with christmas round the corner, this shop would be so cool to be in. At Rottenburgh, I did little shopping, buying some little gifts and a cute german bear for my pouch.  It was off to Innsbruck, Austria in the afternoon. We were greeted by beautiful mountains with snow capped alps. It was views of these snow capped alps everywhere, in all directions. Very beautiful mountain landscapes. From our hotel rooms, we could just sit by the window ledge, a cuppa on one hand, book on the other, and snow mountains just right before us.  In the evening after dinner, watched a local culture dance and music performance, which was very well worth the evening and money spent. Free first beer and wines for everyone, and we were entertained with dances, songs, and instruments performances, making the evening a lively, joyous & hilarious nite, and we were all enjoying ourselves.   Thursday 17/06  Breakfast: Hams, Salami, Cheese, Bread. Today, it was goodbye to Innsbruck at 7.30am, and Venice, here we come! The afternoon was spent in Venice, Italy in this busy, bustling, full of live city island. Venice, being a part of Italy had drifted away from the mainland of Italy a long long time ago. Now, this little island, once a fishing village has become a crowded tourist attraction, as well as houses for millions of inhabitants. Here, rivers ran thru the island. Therefore the main transportation to get around the Venice city centre is by the gondoles, a sampan-like knight looking boat, and rowing it thru. We visited a very very old grand magnificent huge church. Stepping inside, chills ran down me. The church looks exactly like those seen in movies where dracula, bats and vampires live. Inside the building, the atmosphere felt heavy from the deep solemncy everywhere. The lightings were dim yellow, with several prayer halls along the exhibited way. Looking around, I scanned thru the 2nd storey, hoping to catch glimpses of draculas whom might be sneaking and peeking around. I think I siao liao! We then visited a glass-blowing factory, and this was the first time I sae with my very own eyes, how a glass vase was made, from SCRATCH! It was interesting to know glass was made from sand, with several other minerals, and bake in high temp. furnaces. It takes 10 yrs for an apprentice to become a glass master, and several yrs for a glass master to gain the experiences as a perfect glass designer. So cheem! But it sure takes lots of skills to one be one such master. Dad bought a red glass set with a tall bottle neck and 6 short glasses costing 770EUR. And apparently, red coloured glasses were more expensive than other coloured ones becoz it was mixed with sand, minerals and gold to get this colour. Therefore, anywhere you go, as long as it's red glasses, they sure do cost more. =p Knowledge neh!   Then it was check-in to our hotel rooms in Verona, Italy in the evening. All tired, we were served a fantastic Italian buffet dinner. I ate not much, but it was filling. To conclude the day, the Italians are not at all friendly people. They are so very stuck-up with the air in them.   Friday 18/06  Breakfast: Hams, Salami, Cheese, Bread. Visted the city centre of Verona, Italy. Saw the famous literature story place of Romeo & Juliet, the balcony where they were said to fell in love. And we were all told that touching Juliet's right breast of her statue outside her balcony, we would be lucky in love. Crap! Anyway, just to take a pic with it, I touched her right breast, and my sis her left. Well wat would that mean anyway? Real crap! Shopped around the Romeo & Juliet sovenier shop and bought several little pieces.   It was then off to Lucano, Switzerland for an hr and a half. I shopped for loads of swiss chocolates here, picking and choosing, and it was hard decisions to make on which to buy. There were just too many. Arriving at Lucano, and checking into the hotel we were to stay for the night, we were greeted warmly by the hotel's lady boss. Explaining wat we were to have for dinner, as well as how her hotel and dining areas are being managed. This family hotel is warm to stay in and dinner was delicious. We had buttered rice, grilled chicken, noodle, and curry. Exploring this little city, Lucano has beautiful lakes with swans paddling elegantly in it. Houses on hill slopes, and thick forestations. Heading off to Fluelen, snow alps appeared along the way, and the weather turned even much colder. Fluelen has beautiful sceneries too. Its mountains and lakes, swans and ducks. It has a surrounding that provides the relaxation you might be looking for, a place to escape from any tense stress from stupid workplaces and ever so busy society.   Saturday 19/06  Breakfast: Hams, Salami, Cheese, Bread. It's shopping day today at Luzern, Switzerland. Manwell took us to Bucherer to shop till we drop. Swiss knives, watches, chocolates, cheeses... I bought a white swiss knife that has several functions with my name engraved on it for 29EUR, 2 mont blanc refills for 4EUR each, 2 cute mugs, and a key chain. I then took brother along, and we just walked around the city and i think we had explored this entire shopping district. Brother was so afraid that we might get mugged, asking me to always walk along busy streets, and he just clinged on to me, afraid of getting lost. He He He...  Then, it was up 2000m to Stanserhorn alps by train and cable carriage. It was freezing cold up there. No snow, but we were greeted by fogs and clouds, and chills. It's just moutain tops and landscape sceneries up there. And lucnh we had here was so very expensive. 6 pieces of nuggets with fries costing us 17EUR! It was mad!  Our night was spent at Dole, France, a stopover for our route to Paris. We had already travelled hrs from Switzerland to Dole, France. And it will be another 480km, 4 hrs journey from Dole to Paris! I am getting sick of long coach/train/car rides! And french dinner at the hotel sucks! Poor service, poor quality food, and the hotel rooms sucks too!   Sunday 20/06  Breakfast: Hams, Salami, Cheese, Bread. On route from Dole to Paris, the tour's last city, with temp at 12degC, it was a freezing cold morning. Dole is just a countryside with basically nothing around. Jus cows and cattles grazing their time away. France, as explained by Manwell, is famous for its vineyards. It is as well the world's 3rd busiest port, and is well-known for its good seafood like oysters and mussells. There are 364 different kinds of french cheese here, and you can just try 1 different cheese every day. The 3 big cheese makers are mainly from France, Italy & Switzerland. Cool yea!  Arriving Paris just after noon, we toured around the city of Paris with a local guide. Taking us around cathedrals, mounuments, soveneir shops, and not forgetting the all so famous Eiffel Tower of Paris. The tower was huge and grand. And it takes 1hr just to get to the top and to get back on the ground. Was not able to shop the LV boutiques and all in Paris coz the shops were all closed on Sundays. Only cafes with al frescos were opened for business, thus making the Paris evening a totally boring one. Dinner today was not provided in the tour package. Thus it was yucky pot noodles for dinner in the hotel rooms. Taking a short rest, we were all out again ourselves at nite to see the night lightings on the Eiffel Tower. It was beautiful. Took a few pictures and I think I will be printing it on photo paper and have it framed up in my room.   Monday 21/06  Breakfast: Hams, Salami, Cheese, Bread. Today is the last day of the tour. Since day one, we have covered a total of 3500km on the road, making it an average of 500km everyday. And only now do I know that Brussel is in Belgium, Frankfurt and Rottenburgh in Germany, Innsbruck in Austria, Lucano and Luzern in Switzerland, Dole and Paris in France. In all, I quite of enjoyed the week's tour round the 5 countries. And soon, it was goodbye to Yanin, sasaly, and her husband Ted. And the feelings just felt weird..... We had all spent the one week together, eating and travelling all together, and now it's time to say goodbye. Goodbyes, hugs and kisses, and off is everyone back to their own cities around the globe. London, Jamaica, India, Malaysia, America, Singapore, Africa, Australia. And I am now sick of hams and cheese, and I am not going to have them for at least a month or so.

      Finally today has come! FRIDAY, my favorite day.  Went for ndp training last nite. I was late. We, were late. Met angie and sin yee for dinner at bugis, and by the time we finish eating, took a bus to national stadium, change into comfy wear, and got into the field, it was like, 8 plus? That was how late we were. Training todae was fun too. I enjoyed the time spent so much that I wish training could be longer. There were changes in the formation and dance steps, and yesterdae was the 1st time I tried out the circle dance. It was a difficult but yet so cool dance, like dancing tango but in a hip hop way. By the time training ends, it was already 10pm. Though tired, physically and mentally, I enjoyed my night to the fullest, and so did the rest, i think. =p  I woke up this morning for work feeling so tired. It has been like that for this whole week. Setting my alarm clock at 6am, I have been waking up at 7.30am still. Dragging myself to work, feeling now is simply S-I-A-N! Chatting with dezmond on icq now, sharing tots and how we going to change our lifestyle from today. Think he must have encountered some unpleasant events that had him made this decision, and for me, I am going to joke less with frens around me. Some may start asking me why. But well, guess I have to start showing pple that though I can be a joker and made your day at times, I am serious in things I do. But for the moment no joker for the time being. See the serious me. Ha! Weird, jus how some pple I think thinks I am not the serious kind. ??!!  Alrite. Looking forward to another busy and great WeeKEnD =)

      Massive blackout last nite, hitting many areas in Singapore. Jurong area was as well, badly hit. My whole estate blacked out. Street lamps were out. And my neighbouring hdb flats all around were blacked out too! For a moment it was like a shock to me, this being my first experience to encounter such an exciting nite. Looking out of my window, it seemed like jurong just went from a brightly lit neighbourhood to a dead dim town. So eerie, so dark. Quick as I was, I smsed yu telling him wat has happened and called jiachen to see if his area was affected too. What an exciting night! Torches and candlelights were soon all around my room, living area, kitchen and toilets. And it all seemed like we were in the midst of an on-going war and our power supplies were cut. Cool! Well, it took a much longer wait than I estimated. Power was restored onli minutes before midnite for the jurong areas.  Back at work this morning, first thing everyone asked was, Your area affected anot? =p  After more than half a day gone, I have still 2.5hrs more to knocking off. Groans! I have finally cleared my loads of rubbish at work, and old man is on course today! I shall call Wednesday a happie day! Ha!  But... my little toe still hurts badly. Not to mention, in the midst of darkness last nite, bro accidentally stepped on me. And yes! Right on my injured little TOE! And me yelling like a saprano...! ##@??!!!! I have got so many toes, and my feet area ain't small, and yet I can just be that suay to get stepped just at that accurate spot. Gosh! I don think so I'll be able to put on my trainers for ndp training tomoro. Guess I'll have to be in sandals still. =(

      My weekend was ever so interesting.   Was it really becoz of jet lagging which explains why I was exceptionally tired on a saturday morning? Couldn't get myself in sleep mode on friday night after suppering till the wee hrs. And basically draggin myself out of my cosy bed at 11.00am, I rushed to collect my van from office coz angie and I had a delivery to do!!!! Rushed down from jurong to orchard to ubi, back to jurong and to suntec. That was how my mornin and noon was rushed. No breakfast no lunch, so there I was, one hungry little girl finding for food around 4pm. 4-Div mtg at night was great too, couldn't explain why it was, but it just made me feel so happy and good. =p After meeting, it was drinking teh with a few frens from my district: San San, Zelie, Sandy, & Chang Sou at JE entertainment. Burp!  Sunday. SLEPT TILL 2.30PM LIKE A PIG! Gosh! Jumping out of bed, I was like What??!!! Damn it! Immediately received sms from trainer An-Li that ndp revision would be at 4.30pm instead of the 5.30pm time Angie had told me. Smsed Sin Yee to meet her at the new told timing but I was late STILL! Driving down was a breeze afterall, but yet I couldn't make it in time. Oh yea! I received my new pong pong todae. It was so damn cool! So much better than the lok-kok ones we were given months before. =p Today's training was a bit kelong. We were all in a big mess. And me, having absent from the past 5 trainings, was well, a blur block running and trying to follow around, trying to catch what everyone was trying to do. Running everywhere, it was chaos! Faints. Could see my trainer getting all stressed up at one time, but well she did a really great job, given this was her first time taking on this trainer role. =p After training, I escorted my bunny back home from yu's hse, and it was supper...again!   Today. Monday. My first day of work for the week after being on a super duper long break. And how suay can it be? Was just on the bus sms-ing San San about meeting after work, and while getting off the bus 335, I FELL! Trying to balance myself and trying hard to break my fall, I had my heels broken, and my little toe meat on the top sliced! YELLL!!!!! Didn't realise it was bleeding so profusely till like, minutes later? #!@@#!$???!!! Realising how drastic the injury was, I took a cab home, calling my mum on the way asking her to prepare the medicine and sending me to work immediately after. Smsed Patrick that I'll be late for work on this very first day I was supposed to be back. Shit! And in the end, not only did I spent fares on taking cab back home from Jurong east where I FELL, I had to call for a cab to take me to work, thus making me spent a fortune of $15 just taking cabs over that very short distance from my home to my workplace. And why is that so? Becoz..... my mother wants me to wait for her to brush her teeth, wash up, change, make up...Arghhh like I have the time to wait for her! Limping myself in my sandals to office, luckily old man wasn't in his office. Day in office was OH SO DAMN BUSY! Many things waiting for me to clear, and my work load was like so all messed up. Calling people up, people calling me up. And how dreadful it can be when you want to look for some people and you just could not reach them!? And when they are looking for me and Woah there I was! There are loads of junks there lying around my desk waiting for poor me. As well, my whole day in office, I have like dozens of people, in my office, my despatch uncle, my Coy IT guy fren, my personal frens, calling and asking me how was my trip, fun anot, and stuffs like that. And I was like, yah...fun, not bad lor, quite enjoyable, for like countless times. And even after work, meeting up wif acapella frens, I had to say these all over again. And oh, not forgetting to mention also, many times on how I dramatically fell from the bus. Ha Ha Ha!  Ok..so.. I do have a great weekend and great busy Monday. And more to clear on Tuesday tomorrow.

      Uhhh its mondae   again... I am feeling totally exhausted from yesterday's training. My thighs aching from the tower formation where I have to support my friend and another girl in 2 different formations, my ankle hurting with a vein pulling itself tight from the circle dance formation, and all the running and sweating around for the performance. I am not complaining at all for I had enjoyed every part of the training though it strains me both physically and mentally. =p Can't imagine the fun & enjoyment lost when ndp training ends in another 3 weeks.   Tonite is supposed to have my acapella practice, but postponing here and there, now I am also unsure whether we are practicing or not today. But I am feeling so damn tired. Had told Josephine I will be going to Suntec this evening, Acapella practice, plus I just want to stay home and chill out in my room. What should I do?  Groans.....but I am happily tired ^_^

      Days this week seemed to zoom past at managable speeds I like. In a few hours comes friday, and, much indescribable immense joy are now felt from within me. How am I to welcome this great day I have been waiting for each week. What am I to do on this favorite day of the week.  For a while this week, I am feeling rather relax with not much activites on hand. Only for ndp trainings and FD meetings. Haven been able to meet up with my acapella oops mates till last nite, after meeting up with 2 FD chiefs who got me prepared to take up the role of IC in August. I do hope I can cope with all these responsibilites and commitments handed down to me, and I am looking forward to meeting my zone students.  Work is simply one word for this week. And that is extremely busy. For once in a blue blue moon yesterday, I had to stay back late in office, rushing out jobs for my old boss for a huge tender due friday tomorrow. As well today, I might even me knocking off even later coz god knows what he is doing in his office other than not rushing out tender details needed. He should have known at this age how he had always loved amending details, costs, and just anything he thinks he can change in a document. Not to mention a pile of documents to be submitted tomorrow. Suffering most is poor me, having to wait by my desk for jobs to be passed down and coordinate with him.  Am I going to be stuck here the rest of my life? I know the answer is no. For my prayers will definitely be answered and it's a matter of hitting that one job that is there waiting for that moment to come, for that moment I walk by it, and say hey Have you been waiting for me all this while? =p

      These few days come the crucial point in life, thinking whether should I go on with certain aspects I have had in life. It's this thing called loving someone, angering someone, getting upset over someone, as well as thinking of someone. Perhaps it just hurts just too deeply how thinking of someone can be a fault. Perhaps it just hurts much more deeply as well how 3 against 1 outsider felt. And perhaps it hurts like pin on bones how statements were brought to me I can only wait and wait. This week may be the week I start upon yet another single-girl life. This, might be best for the both of us who both claim each of us had done so much for the other, as well as how each of us are claiming the other hasn't done much for the other. How confusing this can be.  I may still be loving him, and he may still be loving me. But things have come in such a way it's hard to turn things back to be as it was that standstill is all it can be now.  I was asked, what position do I see him as. I was told, I took him as a man servant. How funny it can be. Then ask, what does he take me as? If all I had done is just as well invisible to him, I shan't be doing anything more. I am giving up in this long played love relationship kinda game. Will it be game over this time? Let time be the healer, let time be the decision-maker.

      Oh No! It's mondae again tomorrow.... =(  My week had been super hectic. Meetings, trainings, movie, and meeting up wif frenzs. Haven been able to meet up for acapella practices coz all of us are just too busy and our schedules just can't seem to allow us for a meet-up. And it was just like that, and my week's gone. Mum's complaining I haven been eating home for like weeks, and it seems like my company to have meals with them will be part of my filial peity.  Met up with Angie, Lydia, Tham, and Tham's fren whom we met for the first time after work on fridae. His name's Chi Kin. Nice cute guy and we tot he was like 25 yrs old. But well, he is just 21 yrs old, studying medicine in Scotland, and a malaysian living in KL. We had dinner at this Chin Chin restaurant recommended by Tham. Sumptous dinner included the restaurant's famous hainanese dishes: Claypot mutton soup, fish maw mixed veg, special porl chop plus some normal hotplate beancurd & baby kailan. We were filled to our maximum stomach capacity! Next stop was geylang coz angie wanted the famous beancurd there, and thinking of geylang, we immediately tot of durians. Imediately reactions saw 3 desperate durian deprived souls voting for durians after our beancurd there. Waiting no more it was only one direction: To Geylang! cold beancurd was yum yum, drink was chin chow, with lots of crappy crazy jokes & statements. No more image here, gals & guys. It was mad humans on the loose boy! Do we have nothing to do or wat? We actually made Angie gave a 'courtesy' call to witch classmate we call, Sh-rin, to know how's she doing. Yucks! We replayed all her reactions and nerve-getting attitudes all in the nite, making our evening an all-too-hilarious night to forget. Durian next, across the street, yu joined us after his gym core training at GK. We had 5 CHEAP durians! Finishing all 5 of them, I was feeling the puke from the dinner, beancurd, chin chow and durians, all meeting in my stomach. For a moment I felt residues popping up my throat, it felt disgusting, and I felt sick. Home by midnite, tired n full to the limit, I was deciding whether to sleep or not. Well....I slept!   Saturdae's combined rehearsal was put succesfully. This, is comfirmed by one friend I met just now who commented on the great show our soka performance was. =p . Being for the first time we put on our costumes for the full-dress rehearsal, shock was written on all our faces, seeing how short and ge-tai our costumes were. Nonetheless, nothing we could do but wear our tee-shirt, put on our costumes, and bear the heat suffocating on us. Though heated up inside, nothing could obstruct us SSA participants. What's heat man? We had and we will put great performances for the remaining rehearsals, NE shoes, and our actual performance on 9 Aug 2004. Back home, I am tired. But happily tired. =p  Was supposed to meet san san at 11.20am this morning at JP interchange to be at scc for the YWD formation day deco set up. I woke up startled, saw the time, it was 11.20am! Msg-ed her I will meet her at scc instead, and there I was rushing myself in the shower, get changed, and out of home I went. It was raining mongrels, tigers and lions! A heavy downpour here in Jurong! I decided to hail a cab instead and was there in 10 minutes. Today's formation was interesting, nice decos and testimonials, and guidance from YWD chief. And the meeting ended with me feeling so freshed up and I will tonite set upon my conviction for the life I want!   Tonite, I told mum I will join them for dinner after meeting. Meeting yu after his YMD formation day too, for onli a short while, I rushed home to be a filial daughter and we had dinner at a Hong Kong style restaurant in queensway. Back home now, waiting for another new week to begin, and waiting for my next weekend to come. =p

      cool rainy day.  Woke up this morning feeling my body rebelling against that so nice weather for sleep. It was a rainy wednesday morning. With the air-conditioner still turned on since the night, my window over-looking the cool atmospheric sky, and tucking under my cosy quilt, I felt the strong urge to just sleep on irregardless of work or not. Dragging myself to the shower was the greatest struggle every morning, while attaining the skill of dozing off while showering is the greatest skill I have. This, makes up the low tolerance process I have trying to get awake for the morning, that is, make up lost sleep in the shower. =p  Tuned into FM93.3 while dressing up for work. The 2 DJs urging everyone not to fake mcs becoz of this very rainy weather. For sleep or for bread? I would choose the latter. For no pay check means no bread. And no bread means no lifestyle. Well, at least for me.  Monday and Tuesday have been quite relaxing days for me. Just home after work, and sittong by the TV after dinner, enjoying quite a bit of leisure while waiting for next day's work.   My room's now is chaos. With sis's stuffs thrown all over. Even rabbit's agonized by the tragic sight of how my room has become. On the bed, on the floor, below the bed, on the chait, even the cupboards knob wasn't let off. Clothes, make-ups, stockings, bags, accessories, all thrown, hung or jus being left around. To give a better view, rabbit felt no room for her to hop around while out of her tank, not to mention me having no room to walk as well. If I were rabbit, I will think I am better off in my tank. *****  So it's 6 more hours to knocking off. Hope time will pass quickly..... =p

       Weekend was marvellously great, tired &amp; fun.  &nbsp;  Ndp on saturday, we performed to 60,000 primary 5 school kids, and they were all so lovely, cute, and well, that's the way 11-year old should be anyway. Screams filled the entire stadium, them singing loudly when Count On ME Singapore was played, them pledging loudly with pride, and them singing the national anthem so happily though they haven been singing it everyday. These kids......... After our performance, we were all so ~HuNGry~. Met decong who was helping out at SIS, together with xin yee and angie, we proceeded to Geylang for supper. And it's yum yum Spicy Frog Leg porridge and yummy hokkein mee! SLuRPz..... With only filling our empty stomach all we could think of, we goondus didnt realise we were not going to make it for the last train home. We ended up on last buses, back to clementi and hopping on a cab home at 1am and bed at 2am. YaWnSs...  &nbsp;  I enjoyed my sunday morning sleeping. I remembered waking up&nbsp;for seconds at dusk, telling myself how fortunate I was and I must cherish these moments of sleep, before dozing back to dreamland. Ha ha. At noon, yu picked me up and&nbsp;off to west mall where I bought myself a new phone and a new line plan.&nbsp;Guess my phone bill will now be to my advantage, having free incoming calls all day now. And I have made myself betray M1, joining SingTel for the next 2 years at least. Saw quite a few friends there whom we dint expect to meet: Sijia who was working OT at the Hello Singtel, and Amy whom I have not met for like years. =p After FD mtg in the afternoon, a few K-desparados (Me, decong, sansan, lichang, jiajun, gerald, and gerald's girl) met at scc and decided for a karaoke at PartyWorld in clementi. This place sux I will say. Not many new songs to choose, though it has an interesting layout taking into consideration it used to be a cinema. So expect cinema-like steps n slopes,as well as several hallways within. Till 11pm we sang, and till we stoned. Back home, it's bed sweet bed. Haven't been getting much real sleep and rest since weeks or even months ago.  &nbsp;  Waking up this morning. I was late for work. Had just finished with one tender which boss and I had just started on this morning. And this is the 1st tender we finished at such incredible super fast speed, using only 1 MoRNing!!  &nbsp;  Sis will be back TODAY! groans..... have to share my room with her AGAIN! and she's going to mess up the whole room AGAIN! and I have to bear with it AGAIN! *rolls eye* And I am gonna complain complain and more complains.... ARGHHHHHH....... so fast and its 2 years just like that!!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; psftttt

       Lazy. Sleepy. Feelin' all lethargic.    &nbsp;  Haven been sleepin well these nites. Waking up countless times in the wee mornings just to see the time on my clock. I am being too paranoid, so afraid I might find myself waking up minutes&nbsp;or hours past the time I should be up getting ready for work. This is so especially this week. I don't know why. Was it becoz I am getting all excited for something, or,&nbsp;pondering over things, or thinking of someone, or am I just confused with life?    &nbsp;  Haven been reading much lately. And I am left with 5 months to fulfill my resolutions for 2004, left with 5 more volumes&nbsp;of NHR to complete. Of my 8 resolutions, I have fulfilled about 6. Though I feel I did not put my 100% effort in trying to achieve them, I had the least achieve 70%. And no doubt I will continue to strive hard in my resolution laid down by myself, I have tried my best. Now flipping through my organiser, do I realise how important it is to read n read n read through things I have set for myself. My goals, prayers and resolutions. It is only through repeated reading through what I have written for myself do I feel the re-charged immense strength felt within, to once again push forward in search for the direction I am seeking for.    &nbsp;  It's now 7 months gone for 2004. What have I achieved this year I asked? Now should be the time I be questioned. Victories? Struggles? There might be, there might be not. Even if there are struggles in my life, I had realised I take on them like they are so easy to handle. Is it my weak point? Or am I not serious enuff about things in life? Or am I just being an optimist? Able to look on the bright side of things. Or should it be so, while handling a difficult struggle, to be all seriously stern and strict? Or is it that I am just able to handle it all well, coz it is not necessary to be showing people how in tough struggle I am/was in.    &nbsp;  Ponders. ponders.    &nbsp;  Why. why. why... is all I can ask. Unsure of my surroundings Unsure of what I should be. Unsure of the world of human emotions. Unsure of how things should be. Unsure of what methods for rectification. Unsure if the method is right. Unsure of family ties. Unsure of who I am. Unsure of things I'm doing. Unsure of who i'm doing it for. Unsure if this should be it. Unsure if these are meant to be, unsured of.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Thinking so you were so busy   How wrong and silly I can be   Being considerate how naive I am   Somebody you are, so afraid   To call your girl in front of all   To let people know who you're calling   To let people know you have a girl   An excuse so simple so easy   Forgotten the word it always is   Once and twice I can believe   A word used too many how true it is   Not wanting to say the truth to me   Withhelding truth and feelings of my presence it is   How true how real you really are   Forgotten is what you have shown to me

       Again it's weekend over. In just a short 2 days, so filled wif activites, so fun, so fulfilling.      Saturday yesterday was the ndp preview. Raining heavily it was in the morning, so cool, so wet. I prayed and did my morning gongyo with the prayer of good weather when it's time for our performance in the evening. Gathering at SSCC in the afternoon, we received encouragements from sensei from Japan, encouraging us and congragulating us all on this day where we are going to have a great and successful performance for the ndp preview. What's more that touched my heart is, sensei's had faxed a 2nd encouragement to us just on the Saturday morning, more enouragements as well as telling us instruction have been passed down that our SSA performance for the ndp 2004 will be published in the seikyo sjimbun, Japan's 2nd best-selling newspaper! For a moment, I was so touched by sensei's great thoughts of us members in Singapore. For once, have I deeply felt the spirit of mentor and disciple, the topic of discussion for the coming FD meeting. And yes I will, to strengthen my faith and practice, and to overcome all obstacles in my life, and to challenge all difficulties and struggles ahead, courageously. And yes! did we put a great performance last nite. All bouncing hard as we danced, not forgetting the smile we were repeatedly told not to missed putting on. I had danced with all my might. Bouncing, enjoying, to the groove of the music. Feeling the beat, as all of us moved the 60,000 people watching us from around the whole stadium. =p To celebrate, was supper right after the performance. Walking down geylang, supper was you(2) tiao(2) da(4) wang(2), and yum yum it was. Returning home dead tired. Bathe. Sleep. =)      Woke up on sunday morning, oppps..i should say sunday afternoon. I woke up at 1230pm to be exact. Was all too tired to move. Down to queensway shopping centre with yu, then to west mall for a dialogue with a student, then to acapella practice. =) And there's my sunday! =) Oh well, there's my weekend.... =P

      Yes Yes Yes... in 2 days time, Singapore's Birthday!  We finally had the last ndp training for the year. After 4 months of intensive, fun, and enjoyable trainings since it started in April. It wasn't until recent weeks that my group B6 finally get cosy wif one another. Sharing jokes, crapping, and even encouraging each other, during our journney to the indoor sadium, having our dinner together or even just before we step into the national stadium for our CRs, NE shows and the Preview. How I wish trainings could go on and on and on. What's up next after ndp? No more trainings on Thursday and Saturdays. And it just feels so, weird. No more meeting up with friends for dinner and supper after a vigorous training night, no more rushing down from work to trainings, no more for having something meaningful there on a saturday that we will look forward to on every start of the week. Time just flies, and it's not gonna stop just becoz that period of days, weeks, and months was great for all. Time's not gonna stop, and it's just gonna continue moving in its seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. And yes, how frightening it can sound. But life that is, how precious to make it meaningful, full of reasons for each passing day, never to leave even a stain of regret. Treasure friendships, loved ones, even strangers. Treasure every moment spent, be it boring, fun or exciting. Treasure things you see, hear or feel. For time is not gonna go back in a reverse form, back to the past you want, to the state of time you wish it to be. =)  Alrite. Going to bed now. After the sweaty, tiring training which I nearly blacked out. How weak I was today. After the first run-tin, panting from the quick rushing sprint to formations, I was breaking out in cold sweat, seeing stars, and feeling the fainting spell taking over my mental attention. What is wrong with me today? One thing for sure, the feeling I suffered was agonising. Never want to experience that anymore. Never!
