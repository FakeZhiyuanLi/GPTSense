      SO FUN! I just got back from Charles' house, where he, Brandon, Gannon and I played various forms of hide-and-go-seek in the dark. It was great fun sneaking around, though Charles and Brandon won nearly every time. It was the first time I had ever run around Chrales' yard at 1:30 AM... but probably not the last.  La familia is arriving today. That means that I must finished the jobs which are assigned to me. So, sadly, I must leave you.

      In case you haven't yet caught on, today is Sunday. This means that the family is arriving tomorrow night. YAY! Time to really kick the house cleaning into high gear. Yes, around here, making the house presentable is a week-long project. Megan certainly has her work cut out for her with that upstairs which she has made nearly uninhabitable.  I saw the movie "Stuck On You" last night. Have you ever heard anyone say that there are no new plot lines? They're wrong. This movie has a VERY original plot. How many movies are there about conjoined twins trying to make it in show buisness? It had some pretty amusing jokes. Most of them were the kind of visual one-liners which you and your friends might make up on the spot and don't need a movie or a detailed story to work. There was some clever humor, but then there was also some very cheap humor(which is not to say it wasn't funny, because much of it was). Despite the ridiculousness of the premise, I found it to be worth watching.   Okay I was gonna include a picture in this post, but I'm having way too much trouble and it wasn't that important anyway. So now I'm gonna wait for my food to come, eat it, then clean some house.

           Alright, I have good news and bad news... then more bad news.       Good news first- The Matchbox 20 CD still works perfectly! YAY! And that's about it for good stuff.       Bad news- Today is day one of Erica's, um...*counts on fingers* I think 22-day absence. You know what makes the situation even better? She returns on the 17th, AND I LEAVE ON THE 19TH!!! Wonderful. I'm gonna go into withdrawl.       Remainder of the bad news- My Gannon's house plans were foiled. No concrete plans were made until late last night, and I was not informed of them. I called Gannon at about 11:00 today, and Charles was already about to go home. Yes, this was quite the early morning visit. DAG NABBED LACK OF ORGANIZATION!       Well, I'm done with my rants and lamentations. I'll just listen to my Matchbox 20 CD to forget.

           I was mowing the lawn, and you know the little doohickey that's attatched to the thingamabob? That came off, so until Dad (am I supposed to capitalize that?) fixes it, I'm taking a break.        If you're reading this, you're probably my friend. I want my friends to be happy, so I'm going to tell you about a website which should make you happier: legendaryfrog.com. It is where a bunch of people make funny flash cartoons. I think it will please the Homestar Runner crowd very much, especially Josh because it has LOTS of video game and movie spoofs.        I'm supposed to be going to Gannon's house this weekend along with Charles to work on a movie. Okay, allow me to explain- My friends and I like to use a camcorder to make little movies, which Gannon usually writes (with a fair amount of help from Charles). We are planning on working on one called... I don't actually know what it's called, but I know that the premise is that theres a psycho killer guy, so there should be enough violence to satisfy my evil desires. There is also a plan for a martial arts movie entitled "THE FORCES OF NATURE". If you ask me, the script is too ambitious at the present. It will probably have to be revised. Oh, and don't bother telling me I am a big dork, I'm well aware of this.       ANGER! My Matchbox 20 CD was left unprotected and piled among the various computerside refuse, and now has a scratch in it. Well, scratch probably isn't the word, it's more like a crack really. It's very short, but also exceptionally deep. I haven't yet checked to see if the disk still functions properly, but it likely won't.       Well, I'm pretty much out of things to say, so I'm off!

           1:30 AM... time to start a blog! I don't believe I need to say anything about myself really, as anyone reading this will probably already know me personally. Don't know me personally? Well that means I don't know you either, so I still don't really have any reason for a detailed introduction.       I lifted weights today for football. Hopefully by the end of the summer I will be able to kick a cheat 50 yards, or at least bench press my own weight. I worked almost exclusively on the upper body today because, besides being the region most commonly associated with muscularity (when was the last time someone asked you to flex your leg?), it is also where I am weakest. I did, however, manage to bench 145lbs. That's my all-time high! Yippee! Now I'm as happy as a little girl, and stronger to boot.  I could post a lot more stuff, but you know what? I'm not gonna. I grow tired and don't really feel like typing all that's on my mind at the moment. Perhaps tomorrow...

      I'm back from Kansas! No posts for nine days means a really long one today! Let's dive right on in.   First thing's first- the trip there. Dad and I are in the baggage check line. We have been there for a few minutes when I see someone who looks familiar. I turn to my father; "Dad, does that guy in the blue shirt look familiar?" Surely enough, Roy Williams was standing with us in line. He had a golf bag big enough to carry one of his players in, so he was probably going to the upcoming celebrity golf tournament in Kansas City. In the terminal, we approached his wife and introduced ourselves as the family of the woman who guarded the box at the basketball games.   Now we'll move on to Kansas stories! We had a birthday party for someone I don't know, but it was fun! Tyler managed to come over, and we played video games. I shall post pictures. He has let his hair get quite moppy. My pants were far too big, and I have lost my belt,&nbsp;so I had to walk around in a horse stance. All of us, with the exception of Conner, slept in Conner's bed. That's a funny picture too.   My cousin Laura has a baby boy about one year old named Ethan. She brought him over and the kid loved me!&nbsp; He followed me around everywhere and when I put him down he reached up to me again. Megan, being the jealous little imp that she is, claimed that he just liked the view when I picked him up. My explanation is that I'm just good with children (barring my sister of course).   The next day, we saw Tyler again. We were at my Rexwinkle grandparents' house, and jumped on the trampoline. We were jumping delightedly when it began to rain. Did that stop us? Of course not! Have you ever jumped on a trampoline in the rain? It's freaking awesome! You should try it some time. Later that day we went to the pool, ignoring the great ominous cloud approaching. We all went down the slide once and I jumped off the diving board; that was all we got to do before we heard over the intercom "We have spotted thunder and must clear the pool for at leat 15 minutes". About 30 minutes later, we finally were able to get back in. This is when the wind picked up and it started raining. Rain just makes familiar experiences more exciting. There is a certain exhilaration about standing on and jumping off of a diving board in the cold rain which is unmatched by anything else (anything in Coffeyville, Kansas anyway). The pool was actually quite a bit warmer than the air, and the poor lifeguards couldn't get in.   We drove an old, um, I think '73 Buick up to Kansas City. It originally belonged to my great grandfather and my uncle kept it as a keepsake. I had the pleasure of driving it down the highway. When we got to the uncle's house, he showed us another car. I forget what specific kind it was, but it was fairly old. It did not, however, perform like an old car. It in fact had a barely-legal, toned-down racing engine in it. Felling like showing off, the uncle(who I shall refer to as Bill from now on, as that is his name) burned the crap out of his tires in the driveway, producing a huge cloud of smoke and literally tearing up the pavement. COOL!   Now on with the story of our return trip. Not really much to tell here, other than that soon after landing at RDU, we heard on the intercom "We have been notified that a cart of transfer baggage was not loaded onto the plain at Nashville. It will be coming in At 11:30." Bad news always seems to come over the intercom. There we stood at baggage claim, sure that our luggage was lost, when around came our bags! Yay! How fortunate! Then we went on home. By the way, Conner is here with us.   I'm sure there are things I have forgotten, but this is all you get for now. I will now struggle with trying to post some pictures. I guess you'll know if&nbsp;I succeed.

          If you are a faithful reader of the Blog de Justice, you may have noticed a sharp decline in the frequency of my posts.&nbsp;This is because the past week has been rather uneventful. If you are not a faithful reader, GET WITH IT MAN/ WOMAN/ BOY/ GIRL/CAT!&nbsp;I could post every day, but it would be boring and there's really no point in that. However, since I have waited, I now have a nice crop of stories to harvest. Enjoy! &nbsp; Being typical Kevin. I just typed out a paragraph about lifting weights and then realized I had already told this story in the previous post. DOH! &nbsp; Erica returns tonight. It has been nerly a month since I have seen her. I am happy. That's all the more I'm telling you people. &nbsp; There is one particular freshman (isn't it amazing that that term no longer applies to me?) at football who is beginning to push his luck. During&nbsp;the first week or so, he was very timid and generally polite.&nbsp; But yesterday, he just started punching me randomly! He was not serious, but it sort of hurt and really got on my nerves. He also grabbed my shoulder in a place that hurts saying "doesn't that&nbsp; hurt?". It didn't really hurt, but again it was highly annoying. This freshaman&nbsp;may have to&nbsp;pay for his insolence. Fortunately, he is on defense, so I should have opportunity to knock the crap out of him thoughout the season. &nbsp; Daddy and I leave for Kansas tuesday! Yipee! So fun! &nbsp; That one wasn't as long as I thought because one of my stories I had already told, and the other I realized there were fairly few details which I found myself inclined to share. But anyway, have a nice day and&nbsp;comment on&nbsp;the blog, or I may just have to punish you.

      Come children! Gather 'round and listen to a story about a boy named Kevin and his Blog of Justice.  Sunday, Charles and I went to see Gannon in a play at E.M. Rollins. Shockingly, it cost eight dollars to get in. Jeez! Now I only have one dollar left. I better get some more before Erica gets back or I'll be in a bad position. The parents gave me a five for, um... for being so cool. But six dollars doesnt buy much either. Okay I'm getting off topic here. The play was called Carousel and naturally Charles and I found it hilarious. Gannon was in a group of hoodlums, most of whom were his age. Oddly enough, however, one of them was an old guy. Later in the play, it was suddenly 15 years later, and Gannon was the son of some funny guy. He carried on a conversation with a girl (sounding quite natural I must say), annoyed her, and got literally kicked off stage. Cool!  I finally finished To Sir, With Love yesterday. Now to begin Al Quiet On The Western Front. *sigh* I would definitely reccommend it to anyone, especially if you wanna read a short book.  We got back to lifting weights yesterday. Now I'm sore! I could feel a definite difference between yesterday and last Wednsday. I was much weaker. Although, I did manage to squat 225lbs. ten times. On about the eighth one I started to sway back and forth, which prevented me from doing any more squats after that set because of back pain. Ouchies!  Well, that's not my best blog ever, but I hope you enjoyed it. If you didn't, feel free to tell me so in a comment and I will ninja your house. That goes for you too, Chapel Hill people.

      Mom and Dad have finished drywalling the dining room. Now they just have to sand and paint it. That's not something that would normally be in the introductory paragraph, but I had to explain the title. Anyway, since I haven't posted in the past couple days, I have several interesting things to share with you.  Erica got back from her trip Friday! YAY! She left on another one today! CRAP! She will return Friday and finally stay put. I'll be unable to so much as speak to her until then, as cell phones are not allowed at music camp. Oh, I never did mention that she plays piano, did I? Well she does, so there.  Okay, I think we can all admit to doing really stupid things sometimes. It doesn't matter how smart you are, you're gonna slip up and be an idiot on occasion. I slipped up yesterday. I was ready to mow the front yard, but the mower wasn't; it needed gas. So I got the gas can, unscrewed the cap, and began pouring it in. After filling it with a generous amount of fuel, my eyes fell on the other cap that was on the mower. This other cap was labeled for gasoline. WHAT THE CRAP!? After looking at the cap which I was replacing, I discovered that I had dumped a bunch of fuel into the oil tank. I, of course, feared that I may have done permanent damage to the mower. However, we asked Grandpa (because grandparents know everything) and he said we had only to drain the oil and all would be well again.   There are a number of amusing ninja websites on the internet. I was looking at one such site yesterday, (ninjaburger.com) and encountered the word seppuku(doesnt encounter make it sound like I had to fend the word off with a stick?). Not knowing what this word meant, I sought to enlighten myself through Google. I found a whole page on the subject. Nifty! Through my research, I discovered that seppuku is the ritualistic suicide which was considered the honorable thing for samurai and ninja to do if they were defeated or shamed in some other way. So here I am reading up on ritual suicide, when in walks my dad. Naturally, he was somewhat disturbed. I explained to him that I had not known what it was and was only seeking knowledge, but he still thought I was weird. I am weird, but not in a "death is cool" kind of way.  In related news, I have learned how to make myself a ninja mask out of a T-shirt. Quite impressive! It's actually surprisingly good; if you saw it, you would actually know that I'm supposed to be a ninja. Now I can really ninja some houses!  Okay, I'm out of stuff to say. I'm gonna go do something else. Byes.

      How's it going everyone? Uh huh, yeah, really? No! He did!? Wow! Okay enough of your crap, now for my crap.  Charles and Brandon invaded my house yesterday (upon my request). I discovered that I can leap frog over a person who is standing almost completely upright! Yay! You know what's really fun? Okay, listen carefully (yeah, like your'e gonna miss it and I'm gonna have to type it again for you). One person sits on the ground, two others grab his arms. The arm-holders fling the sitting person forward. Now, it is of utmost importance that the sitting person jumps as he is being carried up. This of course results in the person flying through the air all willy-nilly. If he lands safely on his feet, you have done it wrong. As you had probably guessed, I learned that from Charles and Brandon yesterday.  You probably know that my friends and I like to screw around with martial arts weapons and stage fights and stuff, but I bet you didn't know that Brandon is a blackbelt in... I'm not entirely certain. I'll have to ask him.  I watched the movie "Bulletproof Monk" last night. What a stupid title. It's like someone got two random words out of the dictionary and that was the movie title. It was pretty decent, if only because of Chow Yun Fat's  (had to look up the spelling on that one) character. The fighting was decent, but not up to par with... movies in which the fighting is better. Seann William Scott, a primarily comedic actor, wasn't nearly as funny as Fat. But you really can't blame him, I mean, how could he compete with the Chinese accent?  According to Daddy, Mama had the idea of posting a picture of us and our weapons in this here blog. Unfortunately, that was never done. So, I shall just have to invite them over another time to take the picture... then immediately kick them out... and keep their weapons.  How eventful last night was! It made for a rather long blog. Well, now I guess I'll return to my regular, boring life. Until next time...     Why are you still here? Are you expecting me to finish the sentence? Go away!

      Well, I suppose my titles aren't really all that clever anyway... but that's all the more reason to let you insert your own!  Surprise surprise. I went to football practice yesterday to find as sign on the door saying that we had no practice, and would not until monday. I, of course, was utterly crushed. Perhaps in my little time off I can plot something. Something... evil.  Oddly enough, it was quite sunny outside earlier and thundering quite a lot. I was going to concede that thunder isn't really a verb and make a joke about my frequent use of ninja as one, but I looked in the dictionary and thunder actually is a verb. Stupid English language, ruins all my fun.  Hm... I find myself at a loss for things to say. I could continue, but anything I would tihnk to tell you would probably be something that I didn't immediately remember because it wasn't very interesting in the first place. So I'll just be going. Good day!

      Hello party people. I'm just gonna jump right into the news today.  Yesterday mother and I removed basically all the wallpaper from the dining room. How quickly something which has been there for years can be gone. It didn't put up much of a fight, in fact it was already peeling in some places. So now we've a large pile of torn-up wallpaper in the dining room floor.  I went to work with Daddy yesterday in hopes of getting some summer work done. I read about 40 pages of To Sir, With Love, which isn't bad considering it's less than 200 pages long. The book is pretty good, not that that's any surprise to me. I picked it mostly for its length (or lack thereof), but it always looked interesting too. It's about a teacher who gets a job at a school in a rough neigborhood with, shall we say, troublesome students. He essentially whips them into shape and changes their lives and all that. It's nothing I haven't heard of before, but still quite interesting.  With my sis gone I feel like an only child again. Only it's not as boring as I remember it. Before she was born I always wished for a sibling or friend or SOMEONE to occupy me. If I were the younger sibling I would probably wish for a moment's peace. I suppose that, after being both a brother and an only child, I can appreciate both more.   Enough of my reflections! Time to go do something else. Fare thee well.

      Yes, the family is gone and I am back. Time for some catching up.  The party went pretty well I think. I learned several things; Charles is stealthy, you get what you pay for, and fireworks laws in North Carolina suck. Explanations: Charles appeared in my kitchen before I even knew he was here, our cheap badminton equipment was just that (Charles alone broke two rackets), your'e not allowed to shoot any good fireworks. No firecrackers or artillery shells. Those are the two major staples of fireworks shopping back in Kansas! You can't even have anything that moves around on the ground, and roman candles don't shoot out fireballs. How do these lawmakers expect teenage boys to get in trouble?    So lonely! My family and Erica are both gone and now I have no one! Except for my parents, but they'll be gone a lot. There are also my friends but they're stupid. I should have a lot to occupy my time, though, as I am on page 24 of my first of two summer reading books. I must read "To Sir, With Love" and "All Quiet On The Western Front". On top of that, I have a summer biology project to do. That should keep me well entertained.  There is more that I would like to tell you, but I can't think of any of it right now. I'll keep you posted as news (and my memory) develops.

      OH MY GOD! I didn't post yesterday. Now I've so much to tell you.  Yesterday, I watched a movie which seemed altogether uninteresting to me but pleased me very much- Secondhand Lions. This movie is unique not just because it's a Haley Joel Osment movie that isn't depressing, but also because, despite being suitable for most children, it doesn't realy feel like a kid's movie. You're not sitting there thinking "Oh come on. I'm not five years old." Quite a good movie.  My cousin Conner brought over his PlayStation 2, so I've been going to town on it. I've been playing a game called "Metal Arms: Glitch In The System". You play as a diminutive robot who blows the crap out of stuff. YAY!  Tomorrow is our almost-fourth-of-July party. It should be lots of fun. Charles and I (assuming Charles can come) will wreak havoc and terrorize (or burninate, whichever we see fit) the other party-ers.  This bores me... anyone up for a game of basketball? No? Ok then, I'll find something else to do. Farewell.

      Okay okay, I know it's been entirely too long since I wrote anything, but there's really not much to be done about it is there? Let's just forgive and forget. So much has happened since the last post that I'm not gonna remember half of it, so you may miss some interesting stuff.  School has begun again! I have a hard semester! And I hate the scheduling people! I'll tell you why. Several of my friends were in my lunch period, most notably Erica. But on the second day, they move just about all of my friends to another lunch period!!! EVILITY! Okay, enough about school... I'm just too hurt to even continue.  Now on to football, which has less learning and more violence. Yay violence! Thursday was the first we were allowed to hit. We did the drill where a tackler and a runner must run straight into each other and full speed. The first time, I tackled the person, though it's not like I knocked the crap out of him or anything. The second time I was running the ball, and both of us ducked really low for the hit. Have you ever seen rams fighting? That's about what it was like. We just butted heads REALLY hard and both stumbled backwards. Ouchies.  Yesterday I skipped football and did something much more fun- went to a BNL concert with Erica!...and mom...and her friends... that's a little odd. That's okay though, because the old people had lawn seats and we had real seats. Mwahaha! A lot of interesting things happened, so I'll just tell you some of the things that stick out in my mind. There was a little inflatable ball thing which people were hitting around in the audience, and it kept coming close to us but never within reach. Whenever it taunted us in this fashion, Erica got this look of dismay on her face. I knew that I must get this ball. Eventually, it floated over the row in front of us, and being the tall guy that I am I was able to jump up and grab it! I then handed it to her 'cause I'm just so cool like that. They also played "It's All Been Done", which is Erica's favorite BNL song! Poor mama wanted to hear "Call and Answer", but they didn't play it. She just got short-changed in general. New paragraph time!  I now resent Ed Robertson deeply. Allow me to explain. During the performance, Ed was singing, and Erica asked "Who's that?" I answered, "Ed Robertson." So of course, her comment was "He's cute." I'm not even gonna say anything else about that. At the end they played "Shopping", which is probably my least favorite of their songs, but I enjoyed the performance, what with the silly dancing and all. They had an interesting dance using shopping carts and overhead camera angles which was actually reminiscent of syncronized swimming. It was SO COOL! Yay! I'm tired of typing.  No more typing. Bye bye.
