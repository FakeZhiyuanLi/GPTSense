      The  aphorism  “Qualities reveal your soul and mind to the world”, though being forged by me, suits every step of every man’s life. It’s  quality  but not quantity that matters.  For every step one takes or for every action one does, one needs a quality plan and master - mind execution.  He/She may posses a huge amount of wealth, but he/she is said to be wise and rightly characterized, only if he fosters in him, good qualities. The quality of life one leads (or ‘lives’, may be) depends on the quality of his/her thoughts.  If thoughts are good, then he’ll attain fruition and vice versa.  urlLink  James Allen   has stressed, in his famous book,  urlLink  As a man thinketh   (rechristened for simplicity, as “As you think”) that :   A dishonest person is not totally corrupt and the honest one is not entirely virtuous.  I go with him. A dishonest person might have many other good qualities. But this one, single bad quality makes him squalid. So, bad qualities buffet you down very much. So, try coveting more good qualities than bad ones. So, quality speaks much of one’s real way of life, than quantity. Quality excels quantity. One must be qualified enough in the league stage to advance into the super league stage of life. In order to make progress in life, you need good qualities and wise actions rather than showing vice. Good thoughts can provide you a helping hand in  shaping  good qualities. (I know I am  iterating  this statement). One must shirk deceptive attitude and proceed with an  unerring  mind.  I’d like to complete with James Allen’s :   As we think in our hearts, so are we.   I completely agree with him. How about you?

      Rolling my eyelids towards sky,  did I see an a logy round object,  lacking exuberance, twas today’s  moon. Like ours, it’s character amends  everyday. One day …gloomy,  dull, the other day…bright someday.  It’s moon, we admire….  adds beauty to the sky, reaving  sun’s light, brightens the slobbish,  night sky, proliferates the beauty  of the nature. Neither a profligate,  in luminosity, like the sun, nor a  miser alike darkness. It’s something  neutrally forged by Him, may be.  Resembling our life style, may be, not to some..  Fortnight later, it disappears….  Fortnight later, becomes effulgent….  Like, some days very gloomy and,  dormant, in one’s life….  some days bright and gale…  Life is nothing but a cycle of  eventful happenings, may be,  similar to moon, a cycle of  brightness and darkness..

      It was well said by Rousseau “Man is born free but everywhere he is in chains”. What Rousseau meant, according to me, is that man is leading a free and unrestricted life.   But from the moment man has entered the civil society all his freedoms and liberty have been finished.   Yes. Man’s life in the civil society is an artificial life. It is a false and untrue life. Man in the society becomes highly formal and sophisticated. He becomes greedy and wicked. The life in the civil society is not natural. It is a pretentious life. Here man follows double standards. He becomes civilized as wells as a hypocrite. He says one thing but does something else. Is it not?   In the society man is everywhere in chains. I think, everywhere there are a set of do’s and dont's. The social, martial and governmental laws bind man. Thus a man cannot be free in the society. These restrictions, restraints and limitations are the real obstacles in the path of his progress and development of his talents.   Man should try to shed the artificial aspects of his life and try to live a life in harmony with nature, which is more natural and genuine.   Your opinions……. ?

      Mind becomes dull at times....  No thoughts.. No ideas..   For the past three months, I am away from 'studies'. That's forms the main reason.  Yes. Liveliness has gone out of my mind. Very dull... indolent....  No progress being made. Still standing in the same stage of life...   'Inhaling' and 'exhaling' are the two principle jobs in my daily life.. No proper itinerary for a day's work.   Yes. I think I should amend it. I should activate my mind otherwise it will be prone to decay. I think I'll have to be peart and exuberant.   One's mind should never go idle. It has to be effulgent enough. Otherwise life would become a dull stroll towards death...

      He has attained whatever he requires, whatever he craves for, &nbsp;uncaring  about the consequences. He is someone extra-ordinary. Yes.  He discovers…. invents…  But still insatiable. Wants more. But ‘no problems’ does he feel…  Coz, he’s bestowed with something unique, compared to others, to achieve and attain his longings... He is overreaching… Never stops…That insatiability prevents him from ceasing. He hurtles in the field of science especially. Very fast….  He goes on and on and on……  He ideates&nbsp; ‘it’s possible’. He is imbued with optimsm.  He has outflanked all others. He is a maven in all events. Yes. He rules every peck of this globe. It’s his regime.  He is “man”. Man is great.

      What is life? Oh! Atman  answer me! what is life?  is it a process? or is it  a creation by anybody?  Or is it the palpitation of  something? or is it a  world of tranquility? or  is it a cavern? or is it  a volcano of indignance?  Or is it a pitch of  gratification? or is it a  progeny of something? or is it  a pool of savageness and  viciousness? or is it a vial for  bloodsheds? or is it an aura of  superstitions? or is it a residence  of serenity and wisdom?

      "Hm.. What to do? Fate wills the other way." "Have no ways, but to got by fate."   Yes. These words pull down your good attitude, your fine brain, your brave mind and your courageous heart. Huh!   'Fate' is something that doesnt exist (It's my opinion). It has been forged by us. It's fictuous after all. Every walk of Life depends on you and your mind and not on your fate. Every action you do, every step u keep, is the decision of your mind.   Ya. We've seen people blaming FATE as the first two lines suggest you. I, too confess, I do that. But I feel, it's not right.   Try to be antagonistic to fate..  coz.. It would depress your will. Would degrade your performence.  Try achieving, what you think. Forget about fate. Don't let fate govern you.  Believing that fictuous fate, will levigate your ambitions, your goals etc. Try overcoming fate.  You have the power within you to change according to the world, to adjust according to the circumstances. Bring that out...  Have positive attitude. Focus on your goal. DENY following fate.  Go on... Attain what your inner soul wishes and your dreams can come true... You'll attain fruition...

      Hmm...  Life is boring..  No plan. No work. No mind. No effort. No activity. Nothing. What to do?? Can any one suggest me?   Yes. I have finished my +2. And from April 1, I am free. I was elated for somedays that burden was all over. But nah......   It's 3 months since I worked something genuine. Life has become a bullock cart.. Doesnt flee. But crawls....   Very slow..   Mmm.. Yes. Had a friend here, who used to regale me. Gone..  he has gone somewhere..   Days are spent sleeping...  Tried to refurbish my house. Had no interest, but.   College might start somewhere in the middle of august. Still 40 days more..   I have become indecisive. Sometimes, I get ireful &amp; irascible, thinking how to spend days. Every hour crawls.. but no idea, do I get on how to spend.   I am living a rural area. No entertainment. No amusement. Nothing.  Hm.. Even to get a nice pen, got to travel down 15 kms. Huh!   No fine friends in this proximity.  I am helpless, desperate..  Trying to find a solution to quell this inactivity...  Huh!

      Reclining on my easy chair, I  was relishing the beauty of,  the mauve Daphne, Ah!  what a fragrance does it emit!!!  As sun was giving way for,  the dusk to rise up, it was  welcomed by the plashing  leaves of the rangy eucalyptus,  whose pliable branches ostracized,  some of the leaves, it owned, to the,  mud. Why? Why? Was, enmity, the  reason? Or is that tree atrocious?  Or, are the leaves ragged? ………  ..a plethora of thoughts and doubts,  traveled through my mind. So I,  got riled and tried to cease,  probing on that. I rolled my eyelids  towards the sky and glared at the  stars. Inconspicuous.. and at the  moon, very jejune and melancholic  was it.. Bowing down my head, I caught  sight of a cat, with its bright eyes,  staring at me from the facade of,  my bungalow. Trying to hide my,  Fear, I replied it, with my fervid,  Sight on it. Raising from my seat,  I stepped on a grasshopper unknowingly.  Oh ! Oh! What a crime was that ?  Oh! What a mistake was that? Why?  Why should I do that ? What made me  do that? Why did I disturb the eirenic  nature? Oh! Why did I disturb your  creation? Tell me! You divine deity,  Tell me! Tell me!, I cried desperately.

      Easily pulverizable will  be your imperils when,  your helping hands extend  on to the unaffordable...  Serene will be your,  days and happy will  your nature be, when  life is an unerring light,  and joy, its own security.  ….Eternally eirenic will  be your life, if you are  benevolently, amiably  characterized. Eccentricity,  abounds when and where  strength of character abounds.  Life is a machine and  character its input,  output relies upon  character. Remedy for  atrociousness and  irascibleness is serenity,  which gives you a joyous,  plight less and peaceful  life to breathe….

      A buffer for want of death, Climbed an arête with deep breath, For he had the first heart attack That shook him with a shock. A rivulet, under the morning sun, Had it’s serene run, By the wayside producing a fetid Smell creating a sense of trance, for It had many odd smelling fishes Ascending and descending Down the rivulet. The smell made the old man vomit, Made him lie down the summit. Rising up after a deep sleep, Continued, the old man, his creep. As the dusk rose up it’s head The buffer had him fed, As the temperature had it’s descent The old man erected his tent. As the dusk changed to dawn He made his journey on, Reached the edge breathtakingly And glanced at the height wistfully. The old man, getting terrified, Hurried down the arête pacified. As he descended down the arête in peace He overcame the smell of the rivulet with ease. Realizing his foolishness to die, He traveled his way back home.

      Every man in this world is a critic. If a critic is dull-witted, he naturally exalts the value of the work of literature. He magnifies the value of work. In the same manner some glaikit people admire what wise men approve. A Critic must possess a vast knowledge of worldly affairs without which he cannot criticize. If we do not posses the necessary intellectual equipment we will not be able to estimate the true worth of anything. In order to make a true assessment of anything we should posses sense, wisdom and mental balance. So we should not plainly admire anything. We should probe on it to ensure if it is true to be admired. We should be able to see a thing as in itself it really is. There is the need for some sense and a set of values to measure the worth of anything. We should develop in ourselves, a practice of looking deep into matters, probing on it, trying to understand it without any flaw and then admire it if it is right or rise out your opinion on that if you feel that it doesn’t seem to be correct, instead of blind admiration. There is a good critic…

      Plodding through a very thick, forest, a boy was relaxing his mind, for he had been hustled out from his dwell for something. Trying to forget his loneliness, he did sing songs of various kinds… which made him feel a bit relieving. Striding, through the thicket and  through the gusty gale for a  considerable length of time, he got exhausted and sat down relaxingly. What am I going to do for the night? How am I  going to manage the day? What to do…….he was confused. Juddering with intimidance,  he searched for water to have a gulp of it. Oh! Water, Where are you? Aren’t you humanitarian? Aren’t you benevolent?.. After a  desperate search, fate gifted him with a small pond alongside. Noticing  that, he quickened to that pond and gulped the impure amrita and forgot the world, till he was awakened by the plashing shrubs and cuckoo birds which hinted him that, it was dawn. Continued, the boy his plod to infinity, suddenly he was haunted by devils. Oh! Help Me, I shouted, that brought my mom and dad from their rooms, to my enquiry. What made me go to the forest? I questioned…. Oh!… What a nasty dream was it?  Very incredible, Oh divinity, What made you haunt me like this?  May such dreams discontinue  in my life..Oh! Creator.

      This was the topic given to me for the state level essay competition which was hosted by THE HINDU jointly with THE UNO,  which was held a few months back, and I was positioned third.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Thoothukudi – An Introduction:      Tuticorin   or more recently rechristened as Thoothukudi to match with its Tamil equivalent is the city, I would like to write about being quite close to the village by. This city is also known as the   Pearl City   (or MuthuNagar As we call it in Tamil) being the hub center for collection of pearls from the deep sea. This city has played a major role in the freedom movement against the British rule. From the port of Tuticorin was the first ship, which sailed with an Indian flag atop under the captainship of great freedom fighter V.O.Chidambaram Pillai. The Kattabomman brothers, Vanchinathan who have created history with their valor have lived around this port city. Tiruchendur, one of the six abodes of the Hindu deity is about 40 kilometres from Tuticorin. Since 1960’s the new port of Tuticorin has come into being and Tuticorin now is considered one of the major ports in our country.     How liveable is my city today? What can I do to make it more liveable?:    Well now let me come to the moot question “How livable is my city?” Before that let us perceive the criteria that make a city livable. First things first. One of the basic needs namely shelter should be available for its citizens at affordable prices. In Thoothukudi almost everybody has a shelter, even the poorest having holed up in hutments.   The city is free of sky scrappers  , the houses are little cramped in the city proper, but well laid out around the suburbs where quite a number of colonies having spring up during recent years. The cost of purchasing a land and constructing houses is definitely on the increase but still reachable to middle classes. The Port Trust colony, the Thermal Nagar colony, the SPIC Nagar colony, the Heavy Water Plant colony, the DCW ltd. Colony, the Tac Nagar colony are townships built by the concerned organizations with all necessary infrastructure. One thing about which Thoothukudi can be proud of is the almost   non-existence of slum dwelling  . The educational facilities in and around Thoothukudi meet the needs of the children in this place what with a plethora of primary, secondary and Higher Secondary schools. Catering to both Tamil and English medium aspirants the colleges around dishing out degrees in Arts, Science, Engineering, Medicines, Fisheries, Law, Home Science etc. and thus Thoothukudi is firmly entrenched in the educational map of Tamilnadu. Thoothukudi is a Railway Terminus from where we have access to all corners of our country, it has a non-functional airport (I for one am not able to appreciate the lethargy on the part of civil aviation authorities in providing fuelling facilities for the aircraft, the availability of which should make this airport agog with activities), buses both government and private run ply to the nook and corner of the city and we also have the waterways, the passenger ferry service to Sri Lanka. Though the major roads are well maintained the ones inside the city are full of potholes and need the attention of the civic authorities for carrying out repairs. Traffic congestions do take place despite the best efforts by the police department to divert the lorry traffic to the periphery.  There is no proper drainage system in place and the Buckle Canal needs to be thoroughly desilted for allowing proper flow into the sea. Drinking water to the people is supplied through municipal taps and tanker lorries but the demand far outweighs the supply and here is one area where efforts should be made for conserving water by digging out ponds and diverting the Tambiraparani river water, rain water harvesting etc..   With growing population of both men and motor vehicles, problems of pollution have started cropping up. Though the levels of oxides of Nitrogen and oxides of sulphur in the air may not be as high as in the metros or bigger cities, still I feel the switch over to CNG (Compressed Natural Gas in Delhi should apply to all cities and use of diesel for vehicles should be banned. Littering of plastic wastes is a menace in itself (for heaven sake do not brand me as a campaigner of Anti plastic lobbyists and I firmly believe the plastics are very much need for the sake of improving our national economy and no effort should be made to ban them. Let the Green Peace movement look for different pastures!) and the two-bucket garbage disposal scheme namely one for the plastic and the other for non-plastic must be in place. Here again the municipalities have to be woken up from their deep slumber and made to do what they are supposed to do – keep the city clean.  Job opportunities aren’t many given the kind of recession the country is undergoing through even though we have a few big industries around. However these are enough opportunities to star one’s own industry especially in the processing of seafoods, fishing, salt and related products. The SIPCOT complex at Milavittan provides the necessary infrastructure.  Thoothukudi is a place of varies culture and where communal harmony is quite prevalent. The annual festival of the church of Our Lady of Snows, where a golden chariot is hauled up attracts everyone the Christians, the Hindus and the Muslims alike.  Regarding health care, apart from the Government Hospitals, there are quite a few private ones which have the latest facilities and one need not venture out of town for medical attention except for major surgeries or problems connected with heart. Almost all major banks have their branches around the city and the latest facilities like ATM (Automated Teller Machine) is being introduced. Cell phone facilities are available (The city police would do well to stop its use while driving) at affordable rates.    Conclusion:    In conclusion I would like to sum up by saying that the major problem confronting Thoothukudi is the supply of drinking water and as already mentioned earlier rain water harvesting must be made mandatory in all buildings. Digging of reservoirs for storing water (the big industries like SPIC, Sterlite, DCW, the Lions clubs, the Rotary Clubs can help in this regard) and diverting the Tambiraparani water before it meets the sea can be thought of. The two-bucket scheme for garbage disposal should be implemented and the schools around should take a lead in educating the people. The Buckle Canal should be disilted and encroaches around this area should be relocated elsewhere. A citizens committee can be formed to monitor the functioning of civic bodies and the areas of concern like poor road maintainence, sanitation can be addressed to. Should these be done, I believe, Thoothukudi will be a paradise on earth for one to live.  I conclude by quoting Robert Frost:    “The woods are lovely dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep”.

      Renowned are some men,  Who revolve round the sun,  Egocentrically and uncaringly,   Renowned are some other men,  Who are not self-centered,  And breathe for others too.   Significant for their illegal acts,  Are some goons and glaikit people,   Dandiprats are most.   Some of them,   eirenic  ,  Some, frolicsome,  Some of them serene,  And some yearn to be renowned.   Lepers and handicapped are some men,  Who wish for a flawless life,  Desire to be significant,  And will achieve that feat too.   On the contrary, flawless men,  Try to go by fate,  And will blame it, when under trouble,  Difficulty or inconvenience.

      Trying to slake her thirst, on a hot, sultry summer afternoon, from a  wayside cistern, a girl tried to open the gauzed door, which provided aegis, to that cistern. “Is it very resilient to  unfasten? or am I not robust enough? why should you hurt me, trounce me? why shouldn’t you allow me to quench my proliferating thirst? Tell me you divinity! Am I not fit to have a gulp from this cistern? Am I not gifted enough to breathe in this globe? What is spurring you to deny me from taking it? What is walling you to grant me allowance? Are you atrocious? Aren’t you …. humanitarian?” The girl began to question the divine as she was reaching the  apex of her dying thirst. Then ultimately, she, out of desperation, tried to open the door and tried it with great diligence, when the door trashed open and peeping in through she could find no water in it. ”All is my fate”, she uttered  desperately and went off in tranquility.

      Funny? Sleep well..... I do that very much. " Sleep Early. Get up early " - is right. I do the opposite very fine. But I think one must not be restricted from his sound sleep. Right..?  Children must not be forced on a compulsory night study until and unless it's necessary.   Insomnia  - Which I sometimes have... Not often..  Somewhere did I read :     The quality of your sleep will improve because of  YOGA . coz, Yoga increases the elimination of toxins from the body.. I am not sure of it, but..... Anywayz.. try avoiding naps and dozes at night... Have a sound sleep..

      It wasn’t so exciting when I entered the college, which hosted the  counselling . (Here, after 12th class, we use to have couselling for admission in B.E/B.Tech degree for choosing our desired colleges according to our  state rank . It commenced  today .) I wasn’t so enthusiastic. But the excitement was geared up when I entered the hall and it was at its apex when I stepped into the couselling centre.  My all-time favourite use to be  Mechanical Engineering . But according to last year’s trend, for my rank, I was not in a position to get it (Mechanical Engineering) in the most  top-notch  college. And therefore taking Mechanical Engineering was unpremeditated and was almost ruled out of my choices, I harbored. But to my surprise, when I was reclining at the hall, I noticed quite a number of seats left for Mechanical Engineering in my long desired college ( urlLink College of Engineering, Anna University , Chennai, Tamilnadu) the best one in Tamilnadu. So I made that my first option. But seats were getting into paucity when time progressed. I was becoming restless and petulant and started to be malevolent. Twas my turn. I had just one seat left for B.E (Mechanical) in Anna University (above mentioned college) and   I selected it…………………….   I was very happy and satisfied. College is going to commence on 18th of this month.So, I have got into a very good college. I think I’ll have to work hard and study well and do my  best  there.

      Mind plays the most inevitable and important part of everybody’s life. It fosters 'one' and one’s way of life. It shapes  ‘you’.  One gets, what his mind ideates, what his mind loves. Mind controls one’s life.   Here comes the theme of  James Allen’s  ‘As a man thinketh’:     Mind is the master power that molds and makes, And we are Mind, and evermore we take The tool of thought, and shaping what we will, Bring forth a thousand joys, a thousand ills. We think in secret, and it comes to pass – Our world is but our looking glass.

       Environment will steer it's way and we will have to steer towards it....     We have seen people changing their dwellings. We have noticed students getting into hostel atmospheres from their equanimous residences...  "Environment doesn't suit" - This is a comment that buffets our ears often from the 'shifters'. But I think environment has nothing wrong to do with them. Has it got any malice of them? Nah. Their thoughts may be erring...  If one's mind is abject, it's arduous to adapt to the environment. Every thing depends on one's 'mind - set'. One's thoughts need to pure enough to sychronise with the environment, one dwells. Then one will find the environment automatically turning towards him/her and benifitting him/her. Make thoughts and mind fit to adapt yourself to the environment. One has to change his attitude and soul in favour of the environment, then you can surely expect the environment to hold you, support you, benifit you and bring bliss in you.....

      I remember the  4th of July  when I conceived to start a blog and was searching for a good template for it.  Yes. My blog is a month old....  Though I attempted many a times to foster and sustain my blogs, I was thwarted by my mind. None of my previous blogs were enduring and long-lasting. This is the one, which has lasted for two full fortnights and is yearning to last for long. Though the zest, I had at blogging, 31 days back, is missing in me now, I still have the interest in me to sustain this serene and eirenic blog till....................

      Twas yesterday did I ideate and realise that the way of life one leads is all the result of his/her  ‘thoughts’  and the way he/she executes the thoughts. Whatever one does, it’s all because of his thoughts, be it, good or bad.   From now on, I think I have to renovate and refurbish myself. I have to manifest my thoughts and convert them into useful actions and attain fruitful results and live a blissful life….

      People do have interests in many acts of life. “Interests” – Ok, one can have. But that interest must not go uncontrolled.  Got to confess. If I get some new games, I get addicted to it. My whole day’s work gets spoiled and marred. But now I could realize my folly and am in to my effort to control addiction on any act I do.  'Interests' sometimes may give a defiled way to ADDICTION. Addiction results in bad consequences, not good results. Addiction, in every way, affects one and can make him bewail for it. A person may love ‘eating’. But once he has turned into a glutton, then his health may spoil.  Reiteration – Have ‘interests’ but not greed. If you have ‘greed’ avoid over-greed.  Addiction can impair one’s plans for work.  Alcohol addiction - A very familiar one. “Avoid drugs and alcohol” – a recurring statement. But people shirk this statement and then realise while they suffer. Late realisation has become common these days.. Addiction can mar you down. It can have direct influence on one’s health. It can affect one’s character.  A mellow minded can turn bestial, ignoble and sulky. Such an effect it has got. One’s whole itinerary gets spoiled.So, try avoiding addiction or else it can make you a tyrant of your mind and body.

      World comprises of good and evil. ‘Good’ and ‘Bad’ friends. This condition arises only because of the character, those friends have fostered. Had they fostered good character, they join the "Good Friends" group and vice versa.  Friends do play a vital role in one's life. They too have a hand in the shaping of our character.  Good Friends will help you in your empowerment and development and you know how bad friends would be. Yes. They’ll be cynical, malevolent and will mar down your plans for life. There is a saying – Unsinkable ship is friendship. But it has to be amended as “Unsinkable ship is a good friendship”   Try to befriend a good friend, but never tease or revile the bad ones . That’s the motto for “Good Friends” group.  Good friends make world, a mansion to live in....
