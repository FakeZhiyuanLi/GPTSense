      "When you live alone, your furnishings, your possessions, are always confronting you with the thinness of your existence. You know with painful accuracy the provenance of everything you touched and the last time you touched it. The five little cushions on your sofa stay plumped and leaning at their jaunty angle for months at a time unless you theatrically muss them. The level of the salt in your shaker decreases at the same excruciating rate, day after day. Sitting in Sheba's house - studying the mingled detritus of its several inhabitants - I could see what a relief it might be to let your own meagre effects be joined with other people's."   - Zoe Heller, Notes On A Scandal

      Today, we finally moved back to our old house, which we'd given the mother of all renovations. Finally, after 7 months in a cramped apartment across the road, it was good to be home.   I don't feel any sadness for the room in which I spent the last 12 years of my life - not only because my new one is bigger - but also because we did not move away. I'm now certain that nostalgia depends not only on time's gradual passing, but also on the sudden reality of a translocation. I'm full of shit.  Can't wait to get settled in!

      Last night I went gay clubbing. I go once every year, and this time it was to check out the new Waterbar. It was filled with sinuous, muscular forms gyrating or posing to obscure trance, shitty techno, and the occasional overhauled pop/mambo - which of course got everyone wild, me included.   The point of gay pubs is to stare, to pack and press against bodies and be submerged within a surreal eddy of time and physicality, where contact among men flow as freely as alcohol.    Dan was with me throughout the night. He breathed into my ear: "I'm allowed to have fun too." He's attached, and had way too much to drink. I count him as one of my closer friends.   He stood by the taxi as I closed the door, my head reeling and buzzing. Enriched by booze, partings take on a certain pathos. Having always valued his company, it felt strange to also enjoy his affection. But such intoxication is timeless.  This morning, he texted: "Sorry about last night. Had too much to drink." I replied: "No prob. Hope you had fun!"   And so life goes on.

      My outing with David, Jeremy, Chris and Darius yesterday felt warmly familiar, yet strangely disconsolate. Through 7 years of differing timezones and diverging lives we endeavoured to keep in touch. But yesterday, for the first in a long while, we met at the Esplanade's Garlic Restaurant for dinner.  We recalled teenage school afternoons in Ghim Moh Mac's, wolfing down nuggets by the twenties. We gossipped about old classmates, hazarding their whereabouts. We grumbled about the food. We strolled along the windy river, down Millenia Walk, and ended up at NUSS Suntec for drinks and dessert. Finally, we found ourselves at Darius' house, giggling over his Xbox. It was a perfect night, enjoyed all the more, I think, for its brevity.   In the car-ride home we tuned in to 93.3FM. Jeremy, in his astronaut's monotone, said :"I like listening to Chinese music late at night. They never play anything upbeat, only the slow, sentimental songs." I couldn't agree with him more.  Why will I remember this? Perhaps because 7 years ago, I would have just laughed it off.

      I will be looking into people's mouths for the rest of my life.   I could start from the beginning, but everyone has a beginning. So I am now 24 years old and counting, and I've decided on an online record of hopefully the remaining 2/3's of my life.  I'm now studying at the National University of Singapore, and going into my final year. I live comfortably with a great family consisting of 2 sisters, 1 mother and 1 father.   I have 2 border collies called Lance and Gawain, who are, respectively, father and son. I have a long-neck turtle who has survived negligent bouts of starvation, disease, and cannibalism (I used to have two).   I have what everyone else has, almost. Hmmm. It really is the beginning after all.

      There's a reason why people keep koi in ponds. They survive. After one week, only five of my archer fish remain, despite my best efforts to make them shoot jets of water at dangling crickets. The pearl arowana which cost me 35 friggin bucks was possessed of so much proud vitality&nbsp;he decided to&nbsp;fling himself onto dry land.   And not a single bloody koi is dead, the cowards. Looks like&nbsp;I'm really out of touch. Oh well. This should be&nbsp;the last entry of the month, and before I know it,&nbsp;August will creep&nbsp;up like a thief.   Just returned home from NUSS&nbsp;Suntec, where I spent the evening having dinner and drinks (4 bucks for a mixer!) on the terrace with some friends.&nbsp;We were sitting overlooking the city-scape when it started to rain, shrouding the buildings and stirring up a cool wind. It always puts&nbsp;you in a certain mood, and times like this I feel&nbsp;that its wonderful to&nbsp;be alive, and even more so to be able to afford drinks on a rainy terrace high up in the heart of the&nbsp;night-time city. Hah.&nbsp;Here's to the rest of the year. &nbsp;

      Over the weekend I resurrected a very old passion. The long pond beside our house was finally up and running, and ready to be populated. My parents immediately dumped twenty fledgling&nbsp;koi in, and realised that they spent most of the time huddled in a corner at the floor. The useless creatures.&nbsp;  After several trips to a&nbsp;fish farm in pasir ris and a row of specialty aquariums in serangoon north,&nbsp;I came back with&nbsp;fifteen archer fish,&nbsp;five mud suckers, a pearl arowana and a silver arowana, two gar pikes, and what is known in chinese as a "white nine-fin dragon".  I realised that with every purchase the inhabitants were becoming increasingly carnivorous,&nbsp;and really, there's no escaping the past. I've spent the last ten years keeping almost every conceivable breed of freshwater carnivore available illegally in Singapore, short of crocodiles and pirahnas. &nbsp;Already, delirious dreams of clever pond&nbsp;partitioning are brewing in my head for an alligator snapping turtle, an indonesian fire-peacock snake-head, some Thailand leaf tigers and not to mention&nbsp;our decade-long family talisman of fortitude,&nbsp;&nbsp;the very alive and insatiable long-neck turtle who is now impossible to carry because he will stretch around and bite your fingers off.

       urlLink    I took this in Angkor Wat, Cambodia, in December 2002. The tree had clung to life on the roof of a temple and I was only half the height of one of its ancient roots. .  urlLink     A little more about my trip to Cambodia. I disliked the country immensly. It pulsed with an undertone of raw hunger and mute violence, seen in all of its people - from the swaggering, truncheon twirling security guards at the small Siam Reap airfield, to the hawk-eyed taxi drivers insisting on taking you around the city for the whole day for 100 US dollars, to the open distrust in the eyes of young children, to the people's hatred for the Thais, evident in the name Siam Reap, which means Defeat of the Thais.  Angkor Wat was a testament of all things grand and majestic that human beings are capable of. I cannot begin to describe the marvellous beauty of its many temples and palaces and ruins, of which I took countless photos. But the reason why this tree was my favourite was because it seemed to me to capture the spirit of the country most perfectly: its stark, wild necessity for footing and survival despite the inhospitable, barren artifice of black stone from which it sprang.  I know its not fair to judge a country and its people just like that, but in my opinion, if you really want to see a landscape of truly transcendental Buddhist architecture, go to Pagan in Myanmar, where the people behave convincingly so. And hey, they too know all about bloodshed and repression.

      Last night&nbsp;we held a&nbsp;fabled&nbsp;Orgers Outing. It was Laid Thong's debut into our Illuminatic institution, and we decided to hold the rites at Persepolis, a turkish sheesha cafe in&nbsp;deference to the sole suicide bomber of&nbsp;our group, Zak.&nbsp; &nbsp; On the way there, at a very&nbsp;innocent red light, my car was rammed into from behind,&nbsp;which was a sign from Heaven that this would be an Outing of mythical proportions.&nbsp;After taking&nbsp;down the driver's particulars ( NS regular) and car number ( 4-star 8 MID no less - he was on his way to fetch a general, the&nbsp;moron&nbsp;) , I proceeded to our meeting point, mood somewhat befouled. &nbsp; This was shortlived however, as by the time we had gotten dinner going, Thong proved to be more then entertaining. In fact she was a cesspool of vileness worthy of the highest Orger Order. When she&nbsp;stated&nbsp;that she was bringing a male stripper from Canada down next week and asked if we had any lobang for accommodation, we all beamed satisfactorily, passed her the pipe&nbsp;and welcomed her among the ranks. &nbsp; Of course, the rest of the evening went by wonderfully, with most of us offering many a stunningly salacious personal revelation. Seeing as how members of my respectable profession - or worse still, family -&nbsp;may be snooping here, I'm not&nbsp;at liberty to disclose. When we had finally&nbsp;torn ourselves from our seats, it was&nbsp;1 AM. I suddenly remembered my ruined bumper. And school the next morning, on Saturbloodyday. I groaned. I felt quite gang-banged indeed. &nbsp;&nbsp;

      The co-conspirators were: 1) Ghim Moh's Char Kway Teow  2)  urlLink Chocolate  Truffle Cake at Marmalade's Toast. 3) Spanish Tapas at chijmes: chorizo, duck, omelette, ham, scallops and more chorizo.  4) Ruffles, Texan Barbeque flavour 5) Selera Nasi Lemak from Adam Rd (Sultan of Brunei reportedly jets this into his palace), with fried chicken wing, telor goreng, sambal sotong and otah.    I was duly rewarded for my weekend of indulgence with fever, sore throat, chills, and an extremely furry tongue. The doctor said I may have contracted the pandemic Fu Jian  urlLink virus  which has taken the US and  urlLink Europe  by storm. But I think a more apt explanation was offered by a friend, who observed: "The Nasi Lemak has declared Jihad in your stomach eh."

      "This is her knowledge, her field they call it. And it is like a field, you can walk through it and around it and say: These are the boundries. She knows why the dinosaurs do so many things they do, and about the rest she can deduce, make educated guesses. But north of the field history begins and the fog takes over. It's like being far-sighted, the distant lake and its beaches and smooth-backed basking sauropods clear-edged in the moonlight, her own hand a blur. She does not know, for instance, why she is crying. "  - Margaret Atwood, Life Before Man

      Its been one year in clinics, and I have seen the grim fathers and jittery mothers of my 30 classmates climb into their chairs with both a hint of parental pride and a great deal of human terror. In this course we have to source for our own patients, and who better to cajole into obedience and submission, then flesh and blood.   Not so my mother. While others stoically gripped their seats and surfaced for discrete gasps of air at the spittoon, she had no qualms about punctuating my workspace with cries of: "Ouch. You're so crap! you're so crap! Are you finished?". After she had finally left in a huff, my instructor nodded sympathetically and began elaborating on practitioner medical-legal protection.   Then I told him she was my mom. He bellowed in laughter, patted my shoulder in a most fatherly way and walked off. In return for their love, parents really do expect the world of you.

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     Gawain is evil. He has no respect for Lance, his very own father, and insists on eating first, picking fights, and worse of all, pissing on Lance's head when they go for walks. I think that all animals overthrow their hierarchy when they come of age, but this creature is stunted! He's 2 years old but the handler at the pet shop was sure he was only all of 8 months.    Some things in the animal kingdom, however, stay the same. Lance is such a guy: he likes to play tennis balls, sleep, have sex (I'm sure), and expects only his regular meals and the occasional snack of bread, curry puff pastry and other carbohydrates. Gawain eats just for attention. Otherwise, he demands only love. The adorable little bitch.

      School starts Monday. Need to read 30 journal articles. Portugal Vs Greece launches in twilight zone. Have to finish unpacking room. Have to conduct an interview. Have to cut hair and get a tan. I thrive on the hum of mild panic.    Its going be my final year, and there's only one thing I know with absolute certainty: all hell shalt break loose. For hopefully the last year in a long time I will be sleeping less, playing less, reading less, exercising less, dating less (not like I did much of all this in the first place), snacking more, smoking more, pc-gaming more, worrying more, whining more and weighing more.    You see, in this profession it is said that the worse years of your career are spent in the uni. I cling to this hope like oxygen.

      I loved it! Cheerfully blockbustered - The nerdy anti-hero, the ditsy love interest, the vertiginous villian, the tormented buddy, the pearls-o-wisdom geriatric.   Now more then ever, the public needs a leading man who, despite flinging off specs and having hair tousled by cinematic winds, still looks, at best, only pleasant. It worked!  There was this irrelevant scene- the hunched ostrich daughter of Peter Parker's landlord timidly enters his dingy room, asking him if he wants a slice of chocolate cake and a glass of milk. You're certain you've seen these two before: in yourself.  Then a close-up. Her perfect teeth, androgynous eyes and anorexic frame suggests that she's probably a model who, after the shoot, will be heading down to a fluffer party with Tobey Maguire.   The things we still want to believe.

      "How many centuries before the spirit forgets the body? How long will we feel our phantom skin buckling over rockface, our pulse in magnetic lines of force? How many years pass before the difference between murder and death erodes?  "Grief requires time. If a chip of stone radiates it self, its breath, so long, how stubborn might be the soul. If sound waves carry on to infinity, where are their screams now? I imagine them somewhere in the galaxy, moving forever towards the psalms. "  - Anne Michaels, Fugitive Pieces

       urlLink    On the 9th of August 2004 Singapore celebrated its 39th birthday. I toasted the moment in characteristic style by photographing the fireworks from the perch of my favourite drinks haunt, NUSS suntec, and as expected, this was the only presentable shot I could salvage from a dozen fuzzy sparkles.  Ever searching, albeit self-consciously, for the multitudinal symbolisms of life's moments,I think the above sums up my general place in my nation's fabric. The cloth definately aint red. Like a dazzling, half-blurred burst of white I find myself filling the sky, unintentionally propelled into the present from the embers of my parents, my forefathers, who have painstakingly scaled, then eventually consumed, the distant, dark treetops of history. And in a moment I will be gone. What would change on the 40th, the 100th birthday?    urlLink
