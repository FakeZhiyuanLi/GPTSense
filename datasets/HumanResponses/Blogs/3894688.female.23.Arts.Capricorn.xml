      It seems I'm entering into a new phase of life. Rather a different concept for me, having lived most of my life in a manner that has been very planned out for me. Now, with options screaming in my face, and nowhere to go to fully understand what each choice will mean, my destiny stands off in the distance, laughing. I need a pizza;)

                                                                                                                                                                                         Sunday, April 04, 2004   End of the Affair Huma Abid Sheikh.   Whether it was chance or that thing called fate that brought you to me I really can’t say and I don’t believe it really matters. For I have been lucky enough to have the opportunity to have you anyway. And should the winds of time blow hard enough to take you from my thoughts, I can rest assure they will never take you from my heart. Life is a time for learning we must learn that our life is as important as that of any other person on Earth but never more important. I must learn that I have every right to happiness, yet it is up to me to find and recognize it. I must learn that Life is not easy nor is it permanent, others will come and go, and often their departure will cause me pain. I must learn to develop a positive attitude that can handle life's disappointments. And I MUST learn that in order to find love, I must look inside my own heart. For if I can't find it within, I will never find it without. Sometimes, I seem to take for granted the people I love the most... Those who are so important to my daily life; and, who are so important to me. It doesn't mean I don't care; and no DISRESPECT is intended...It is just that sometimes, life gets crazy and there isn't time to do it all, or say it all. Or like you say sometimes it is just not destined AT ALL. Especially today, I want you to know how much I appreciate the loving things you ever said, and how much I admire you for being the kind and giving person you are(that’s bullocks).I hope you know how very much I Love You...Not just sometimes, but ALWAYS. I do.  Happy Birthday!!! 	 P.S. (Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion just REMEMBER THIS)  And with this last mail the seven year relationship came to an end. To this day she can’t seem to find the right word to define it; so just, relationship! Yes, it is tragic that she was in love and it didn’t work out but she has to emotionally cut him out of her life and move on. And as they say the sooner the better...Their relationship was like a magnet they bonded like one and repelled like one too. And I guess it was time to repel now. Why do we let the one thing we don’t have affect all the things we already have? What did she get in reply to this mail?  Z man: Thanks. What did she reply in reply to this? Y girl: You are quite welcome. How did the general public review it as= thanks but no thanks attitude from Z man to Y girl. Another “End of the affair” The story doesn’t end here. This is just the beginning, as to whatever we think or plan goes exactly the way we haven’t planned it so why not hear this story the way you did not expect to hear? The other day I was talking to a friend and she was upset over her own personal affair so out of no where I saw this coming from her. EFG: Stay with who ever you are, by looking here and there you won’t get anything but instead will be biting dust. Remember what I just told you instead of fooling your self with writing such stuff leave this once a “Fairytale” and direct it all towards what you have. (Literal translation of Urdu)  Phew! So not only her … I see this as a latest form of SARS (Severe Acute Reverence Syndrome) taking place in all the females from age group 19 to 25. Though I do believe it invaded Earth long ago but may be then it was “HV” (Hanky-panky Virus) &“TB” (Tough luck Bug) From what I know this is not the age to fool around or do I have the wrong impression…In our part of the world if the female is getting involved at this age then it is strictly serious business. So why cant it be a calm sea, smooth breeze you know clear sky and no clouds for once? Why? Since in the US of A I have developed this habit of going to Starbucks every now and then and gazing at people as if they are not people and some cattle show. But its fun, just grab a frappuccino and that toffee caramel brownie and you are good to go for 2 hours or more. Sit there and read, if not in a mood to read then just look around and acquire or find out or make out…..oh no no no no no no not that make out...Wrong word. You’ll find your self looking at a few really nice round table conferences taking place. Either you’ll L or L (learn or laugh) depending on your level and attitude for acceptance. It was dewy out there, and the café corner was warm, clean and friendly, and I hung up my Nine West water-proof on the coat rack to dry and put my NW fish cap on the rack above the bench and ordered the usual. I collected it from the counter and I took out my journal from my hand bag, seated my self next to a bunch of people and started to write. Lucky me to get a seat right next to a rectangular shaped table this time. The topic under discussion was “Can a person fall out of love?” and guess what the first statement was, coming from a lady who was nearly around her 7o’s “It is possible because I believe that no matter how much you love a person, there’s always someone out there sick of that person that you are loving!” Interestingly I had never thought of it. I told you either you learnt or laugh, but I was experiencing both next was an old veteran and this is what he had to say “No, I don’t think it is possible to fall out of love, maybe your feelings will just subside. No matter what happens between two people you will always remember you felt for that person, and there will always be a special place in your heart for them.”  And the most appealing line came in at the end. I hope I never “fall out of love!” So it is not all that rough as we picture, it is out there.  Amongst the grey hair sat a Desi too and this is how she squirrel away her love story, “OF course you can fall out of love, especially if you go just on the emotions. I learnt it a long time ago that love is a choice we make. Sometimes I wake up and just don’t FEEL like loving my husband. Especially, when he does something very stupid or makes me mad. We have been married 15 years-we divorced briefly and then remarried. (Hmmm) It is a conscious choice we can make. Sure there are emotions involved, but in the maturing of a relationship, eventually those emotions evolve into companionship and being in tune with each other and each others needs, wants and desires. There are some times when I get those giddy goose bumpy feelings about my husband, but I look forward to the maturing process even more. So what I mean is, we do not fall in love as one may think Love is a decision; we make and let ourselves do. Yes, you can stop loving someone if you want to. Love is something we must work at to keep it strong. You get out of it what you put in to it!”  Well, (sigh) that was my reaction to this one and so I remembered “Marriages are made in heavens but again, so are thunders and lightning, tornados and hail.”  And with this I got a call from my husband who was waiting out side for his love, and affair to get started. As I moved out the sky was a lot clearer and the air more refreshing and I thought about that e-mail and just wished that Z man doesn’t fall out of love with Y girl, one of the wisest sayings I could think of, then; was “…love never dies…it simply changes forms…” I think once you have fallen in love, you can’t leave. Sure the feelings die when cold silence. But I think the person you love will always be in your heart. And whenever you see him/her your heart still thumps harder, and you begin to have subtle feelings- it is probably just you reminiscing about the past.   I thought maybe the past is like an anchor holding us back, maybe you have to let go of who you were to become who you’ll be.

Ygirl:So is there something you want me to ask you in particular...............Mr. Not Worth it and Mr. punctual!  Z man: Maim whatever you want to ask would be considered as "your wish is my command." Y girl: I asked so as you.....said you your self said, you’ll answer my questions from now onwards. Z man: Sorry it wasn’t for you. Wrong window. I am so sorry Miss Y for this indecent act of mine. Y girl: Should be Y girl: But vindication accepted Y girl: If I may ask who was it for, then. Z man: I am grateful. Miss Y has always been kind to this ordinary mortal. Y girl: So I have been…Sir! Y girl: The indecent act I am inquiring about here? Z man: It’s nice that you are extending the similar courtesy though very undeserved but her highness benevolence knows no bounds. Y girl: Oh, not at all sir answering back in the same conduct is my pleasure. Z man: Pleasing this person has always been your priority baroness Y.  Y girl): baroness? Now what on the earth does this mean? Z man: it’s an English title given to a woman. For men it is baron... Z man: should the baroness needs further explanation...Can ask  Y girl: I don't suppose baron........using it like this, is it the right way? Z man: I beg your pardon madam. Your last statement remains bit unclear for an ordinary mind like mine... Y girl: Exonerate me for such an immature act but you addressed yourself in a very polite manner..........it should have been for a “pea brain like me”...Instead Y girl: Mr. Z enough of this Y girl: I need to breath now Z man: Only if my kissing right restored. Y girl: Z man: no more kisses for you, you don’t deserve my kisses.................I abide by your wish SIR...or I should say Good Sir Y girl: and vice versa Z man: yes lady Y…that was my statement. I shall abide by it till death should you continue with the language that we have been using for our discourse.... Y girl: Nooooooo Z Z man: or else. I need the right to kiss and being kissed. Should you think it’s too much of a demand? I can still live. (For living without it is already destined and destinies can only be changed by the great ones and I am just a person living in this world till I complete my term)  Y girl: the crowning of this wishful thinking will be consummated when we ever encounter each other........ Y girl: That’s all I wish to say on this affair… Z man: our encounter seems to be tied up in knots for ever maim. We cannot meet...or else lady Y must have plans which are not disclosed Y girl: Further discussion on the account will bring more lacerate and nothing virtuous Z man: was I virtuous ever...I ask the lady... Y girl: what if the lady does not wish to answer Z man: then consider the question was never asked. Her majesty could turn down whatever she wishes to at will and stroke...in her kingdom its absolutism.  I came across this discourse of dialogue from the “Do Not Times” but at a very chichi place. “Apple” yes, “The Apple outlet” on Michigan Ave, Chicago. As me and my husband slowed down for a little fast food and to check our emails. Still a little dopey I looked around to find who could actually still talk no, no, no no not talk but actually chat in such an aristocratic manner that too in the Windy City. But to my dismay none around fit the script well. So I copy pasted and christened my inbox with this holy English rap session. Hushedly chuckled and walked out of the main door towards the Cheese Factory. As I past across the Magnificent Mile an unholy brain wave struck me. Standing in the waiting line for my turn to get seated I couldn’t stop thinking about time, was every second of our life controlled by fate. Or is life just a series of random occurrences? If Miss Y was by any chance ten minutes late to get online. She wouldn’t have ever run into Mr. Z. Is time every thing? While I was still debating silently in my mind my eyes caught a very charming girl sitting under the umbrella and talking to her friend “Like every women consumed with a relationship problem, I needed a project from obsessing and my hands from dialing his number. The moment I fixed the hands free set it was you on the other end. So here I am saved from the close call of calling him. Not bad timings this time.” I felt a curve on my face and I bet my eyes twinkled, for I was just in time to hear that. I gave way to another couple who was right beside me and thought enough cheesy thoughts on my behalf. Enough rats waiting to get in the rat race…so one out won’t make much of a difference. Tsk tsks see another cheesy thought!!! Walking towards my hotel I passed across the M.M again, but this time thinking, can you make a mistake and miss your fate? Got my self a cab and there it was right behind the drivers seat, “Which Tarot Card Are You?” CALL 1-tar-ots-card!!! And I thought to myself, just because fate doesn’t deal you the right cards, it doesn’t mean you should give up. It just means you have to play the cards you get to their maximum potential. With the cab meter passing its verdict $6.75 and myself having no change…I gave the cab driver a bill of $10. Through the partition as if a prisoner giving out a letter to send back home and politely asked him to keep the change!!! As I flung the door and shut it back. The driver lowered his window and said “We are no prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of our own minds. Thank you and you have a wonderful evening maim!” A spontaneous “You too!” springed up from my mouth. And I walked towards Hyatt’s main entrance I saw my reflection in the revolving door and the tilted crescent on my face that wrinkly forehead and those tipsy eyeballs and thought to my self, hmm WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO , YOUNG LADY!!!:)    p.s. (Thanks to a friend who helped building the conversation)
