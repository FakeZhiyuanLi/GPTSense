      I've got this idea in my head, that if you want to keep you blog attractive for reading by others, you have to submit short posts.  Many ppl don't like very long posts, or they have to be extremely well written.  With structure and a good choice of words.  No bullshitting.  Unfortunately for me, I usually end up bullshitting when I start typing.  That's just the way my mind works.  I don't care that much if ppl read this blog though.  But I would also find it nice if some ppl did and then post a comment or something.  For those few, I might keep things short and organised.  But excuse me if I sometimes wander a little too much.  -- Here is it were a post already has to stop.  This should be enough words to explain one Idea a little. --  But if I wanted to explain an idea in it's wholeness, I'll have to make a long post. (better a few short ones than one long one though)  Ok, I'm still not gonna stop.  I'm gonna tell a little more about my day. Or not. I suddenly don't feel like writing anymore.  It probably has to do with me having to work tomorrow, which I totally don't want to be doing.  But I need money.  Stupid consumating behaviour!!  *a little sidenote*  I've started to oblige myself to write everyday.  Not in here.  Just on paper.  It's all because of this book I'm reading.  Everbody interested in writing (or zen buddhism) should read it.  It's called  ZEN and the art of creative writing  by  Nathalie Goldberg .

      I have been quite busy today.  All of it related to my band "De Kiekes". We've made some promotional things, rehearsed whole day, even started with two new songs. When the band members left, i went to my computer and worked on the band's website.  It needed work, cause the old site isn't that good anymore (that's what you get with free website building sites) Now it isn't finished yet, but the curious one could already go there and download some of our songs.  Don't have more to say about it.  'cept maybe the site's address:   urlLink De Kiekes

      I know, it's my fourth post of today (or my first of tommorow).  But who cares anyway?  A friend of me told me he had a job for me (with the same firm where he has found one).  So he asked me that he could come to my place and talk with me, 'cause maybe I could be interested.  Though he couldn't explain what it was about.  (He might say something wrong) Curious as I am, I agreed, so this evening I opened the door for my friend and somebody he worked with (and who was already a long time with that firm).  It surprised me already to see my friend in a suit, 'cause a month ago he was still talking of getting a job in the harbour for unloading ships.  But surprised or not, I let them in. Now, I guess my friend doesn't know me that well, 'cause his partner started talking about selling these retirement saving policies, and about commercial thinking.  But though I can do my bit of talking (when I want to), I'm definetly not into commercial thinking, let alone selling financial insurements. So, professional as my friend's partner spoke(my friend almost didn't say a word), the only thing I could think of was showing him through bodylanguage how uninterested I was.  It didn't take that long (let's say 30 minutes) before he understood my point of view.  And so they left.  And hopefully that was the last time we spoke of it.

      As I'm sitting here behind my computer, and starting up this new blog, I see that my first two posts are just things I've recently written (in Dutch, but translated for this blog).  I often feel the need of writing such things, but I don't often do.  Still I feel that I should write more.  Though some people will think it's just crap that I write, I think it will help me.  It will help me with aquiring a better vocabulary and maybe someday it'll help me clearly explain what I'm thinking and feeling. At the moment I feel that I can't, and I don't like that feeling.  So that's why I started this blog.

      I'm sitting comfotably in a chair, next to a table, outside. The sun is shining and I'm not wearing my socks. I could find this pleasant, like so many others would, but I don't. At the moment I have a much bigger need for constructive social contact than I do for peace and birds whistling.

      A man walks in the street.  He's on his way home.  Almost there, he crosses the pad of a young lady. "Sure is pretty." he thinks just before their eyes meet for a second. What does he notice - the dilation of her eyes, a movement of her lips, the raising of her eyebrows - that makes him think she could like him? He turns, while she's slowly moving away. "Hey!  Don't I know you from somewhere?" he could lie.  Or "What's your name?" and make her a compliment.  Or maybe she would like to go for a glass of wine at his place.  Or they could jump right into bed. He turns back and walks on. "I'm still attractive." is the only thought that remains about this moment.

      A guy walks in a bar.  He has his raincoat on and carries a helmet.  He puts his helmet on a table in the most backward corner of the bar and walks out again. Five minutes later he's there again.  With the same raincoat on, but this time he's carrying a glass of beer.  He sits behind the table with his helmet and lights a cigaret.  Then he puts on the hood from his sweater, so nobody can't see his eyes. While not watching anything special he slowly drinks his beer and smokes his cigaret. When both are finished, he just sits there. After some twenty minutes more he stands up, put his hood down, takes his helmet and walks out.  I'm probably the only one who noticed him.

      Yesterday was quite a busy day. After rescheduling my lessons last week, I found out that the new scheme worked well.  I'm taking two students at the same hour now, and it encourages them to think more about the fun art that playing the drums is. After my teachings, I had a "date" with a friend.  It's almost her time to go back to her real home.  And during these last weeks, we grew closer together.  I found it strange, but also nice and stimulating, that, at almost the end of this date, we found eachother laying in eachother's arms on the grass in a beautifull park.  Kissing and enjoying the sometimes hidden sun.  And she laughed gently and I looked at her and sensed her and found that she also found it strange that the two of us were doing such intimate things with eachother.  And she said she didn't love me and that we should keep it a secret.  And I agree, and I don't love her either.  But still there was this 'magic' in the air, and she looked beautifull, and all happend as it was supposed to happen.  And I don't know what will happen further, but I do know that it will go the way should.  Not because of what I or what she wants, but because everything felt like it was going it's most natural way. And because I was hungry, I bought her an apple on the way back to her guestfamily.  I ate one myself as well. In the evening, theatre rehearsal went as usual.  Exercises for learning to dare touch an other, and for trusting the others in the group and completely following the lead of somebody always make me feel energetic.  The improvised dramatic dancing usually does that to, but not this time.  And then an accident happend.  Two friends danced and bumped their heads together.  The girl was missing a part of her tooth, and we found that back in the forehead of the guy.  He lost his sight for a minute and was spilling blood over only one the right half of his face.  Though not deadly or very serious injured, we stopped rehearsing for that day and made jokes about teeth. The evening continued with an unexpected meeting in a bar I frequent with my long time no see cousin.  She was doing well is probably the most important thing I remember from our not boring conversation.  It was nice seeing her again also. The evening ended with me going home from another bar, saying goodnight to the friends who still were there.  It was a day to remember, I decided before falling asleep.  So writing it down here can help doing that.

      Two weeks of working are over.  Filling bags with 20kg of powderized plastic, and then stacking them on piles of 60 bags (or 1200 kg) is something I hopefully won't do again for some time.  I earned some money, and it's probably all gonna be spent quite soon. But I look at the bright side.  With my new computer I finally can make decent videoclips of my band.  Now I'm taking the week off, but then I'll probably gonna look for another job.  I still got some things in mind where I need money for.

      Written somedays ago, but due to computer problems just posted right now.    It was a sunny day, so we put some tables outside to work there. I had to lead the group. Unfortunately my group wasn't working so well with me. I didn't blame them. After all it were their last days here in Belgium, so why should they spend that time with doing long think-about-your-expierences workshops? Though I got a little ennerved and also a little angry. That happens often when I want to tell something and nobody's paying attention. Who wouldn't get annoyed by that?  But finally I got them to work a little.  Of course, I didn't show how I felt. I don't often do that. I'm actually well trained in not showing my feelings. If that's good or bad isn't important now.  But then there was this girl. She's in my group and I'd a strange but intimate relation with her. She came to sit next to me. I brought this topic up and we talked about it. Most of the conversation was covered with logic. That's good, cause logic is a good way for understanding things. But it's also bad, 'cause logic isn't a good way for reaching deeper truths. Logic stays too much on the surface of things.  And maybe she didn't know it, but through the conversation that girl made me realise that I was thinking too much from my perspection and mostly about myself. She has done this quite often in the short time I spent with her. Being with her made me see how egoïstic I sometimes can be. I can't yet say how much that changed me, but I'm thankfull for the insight.

      These days will be days of saying goodbye. Goodbye my friends from far away countries. Our days here come to an end.  A party to celebrate the fact that you're leaving? Is it really a celebration?  I don't like goodbyes. I like hello's. When it's my time to say goodbye, I rather sneak away silently. I hope you won't do the same.  Maybe a party is a good idea. Let's see eachother a last time at a happy moment.  Good memories last forever. Or so I'd like to think. Bad memories are to be let go. They have no use anyhow.  Let's remember eachother at our happiest moments. (mine is a big smile from you)

      I was rejected last year.  I felt no need of trying again.  But I did go there once more.  "Why not?" I was asking myself.  I only had to give them one day of my time.  And since I wasn't spending my time meaningfully, I redid the entrance exam. It started out quite the same as last year.  Almost the same questionary.  The same writing tasks.  And, most important, the interview. The results were a bit different though.  My demographic statute hasn't really changed so the answers to the questionary where somewhat identical to last year.  But my inner persons have changed these last months, and I've practiced my writing more.  As a result, my scribblings floated more easely out of my pen. The interview was even a lot different.  Due to lack of personnel, instead of two interviews with two teachers, I now got one interview with three teachers.  The questions where kinda the same, but not my answers.  Though I didn't sell my soul and started lying and selling myself.  I sticked to the truth.  I didn't care enough to be nervous not to pass. It all was finished very soon after lunch, but I had to wait until 6pm to hear the results.  I killed that time with talking to other candidates.  One of them a beautifull palestinian with a mouth that was reluctant to stop speaking. At the time of giving results, I got nervous.  I didn't show it, but my heart was in my head and my stomach was non-existant though also pulsing.  It must have been a good sign, 'cause now I'm allowed to sign myself up for the movie-making courses at the art school in Brussels. I'll probably be spending the next four years there.
