        Hey folks!!!  Well let's see to day at 12:15 this morning i had to go get my hair done.......i got it back to my natural color.......my natural color is dark brown but i used to have it blonde......but now it is back to brown-and i don't really like it a whole lot....i liked being Blonde!! I also got my hair cut...it is a little different than what i am used to but i like it!! Right now i am at whitney's house and we just got back from seeing anchorman-which was kind of silly-but it was ok!! We saw some of our friends there so that was cool!! I am gonna spend the night with whitney tonight and we are gonna go shopping tomarrow.....which is my absolute favorite thing to do!! Travis hasn't called me in a couple days and i amkinda upset about it....i just can't lose him and i am afraid he might be gonna break up with me or something......which i really hope he doesn't.......and tomarrow will be 9 months that me and him have been together....which i am very happy about!! Well i guess i have said enough so talk to you later.....bye!!
