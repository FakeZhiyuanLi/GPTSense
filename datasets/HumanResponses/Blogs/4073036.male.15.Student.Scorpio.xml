       Hey Im Doug, for those that don't know me Im Raul's brother,for those that don't know Raul,Im a pretty kool kid;thats why I named this blog Kool Kids Blog.   Well since I just Introduced myself, I will you a few thing about myself.   Im fifteen years old and Im going to NDSS(North Delta Senior Secondary)&nbsp;in september.   Can't wait to attend High school, it's going to be so kool But Im still kinda nervous to be a little kid again.   When I was in Junior high I was in grade 10,&nbsp;I thought I was the king of the school;everyone thought I was kool,I had the koolest friends and I had supuriority over the little Grade&nbsp;8's and&nbsp;9,s.    But since Im&nbsp;going to&nbsp;  Grade 11 Im going to become inferior to the Grade 12's,not to mention the other Grade 11's.   Basically what Im trying to say is that I will have to make a new image of myself,make new friends,make new enemies.   Most kids in my class barely passed&nbsp;Math10 this school year,I can't imagine how hard&nbsp;Grade 11 math is.   Im going to take Band in Grade 11,I was the best Trumpet player in my school&nbsp;but I know next year&nbsp;Im going to have tough competition, which kinda sucks because&nbsp;I had the worst band teacher this year.   Ms Robinson, the worst band teacher ever;she held me back so much that Im going to have to practice really hard for next year,STUPID TEACHER.   Ms Robinson, tried to teach me and my friends to play guitar even though she DOESNT KNOW HOW TO PLAY GUITAR.   Last year Mrs Lucas left band teacher position,she was the best teacher ever;she let us play good music but then Ms Robinson filled in for her and she made us play crappy music.   My friends hated her too, o-well.   My friends think Im on drugz but I don't know why,I think my lack of sleep might make me look like Im on drugz.   Im tired of typing Im going to take a nap or something, so if you want to talk about stuff then add me to your messenger at  urlLink Gangstar41145@hotmail.com  or  urlLink Mr_mcneil_32@hotmail.com  .   Have a nice day.&nbsp;
