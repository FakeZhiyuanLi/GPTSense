      I walked on, sad, hurt, and disappointed at the time I had wasted and the girl behind me. I looked at my watch to see how much time I had left. The hands on my watch spun quickly; there was no concept of time here.  The road ahead of me seemed to drop at my feet. I stared down at the bottom and watched the path fade into the grass. Near the end, the cobblestones had been pushed out as the grass pushed its way through the stones. I didn’t know how to get down the hill; it was scary looking down at my potential death or maiming. So I sat down, closed my eyes, and started scooting down the cliff.  I didn’t open my eyes once, and I felt my way down until soft spring grass was completely under me. I opened my eyes and stood up. A huge field of grass stretched out ahead of me. I glanced behind and there was no path behind me at all. I smiled and ran ahead, into the center of the field. Smiling I starred up at the treeless horizon and spun. The stars above me quivered. I was happy to be away from danger. I sat down to catch my breath, and the world slowly stopped spinning, but the stars didn’t. Fireflies were the first thought in my head. I reached up to grab one.  “Lemme go!” a shrill voice said, and I immediately opened my hand palm up.  “Sorry,” I said.  “Again with the touching things,”  I added silently. I looked closer. “You’re not a firefly,” I marveled. The thing in my hand appeared to be nothing but a ball of light.  “Wonderful deduction Dr. Obvious, anything else you’d like to tell me that I already know?” It shook sarcastically.  “I just didn’t know what you were, sorry.”  “I am a singer,” it said melodically. “My brothers, and sisters, and I sing people to sleep in the night sky.  “Really? How wonderful, sort of like the Sandman.”  “Oh no!” It shook violently, “We are much superior to the Sandman, he doesn’t even do anything. We bring your dreams at night. We are the ones that lull you into the slumber that you need. We are singers.” I breathed out slowly and crossed my eyes trying to get a better look at what was in my hand. I could see nothing, but twice as many lights around me.  “Could you sing for me?” I asked. The ball began to shake, and more surrounded my hand. They outlined my arms and shoulders, and I had the strange sensation of tingling in my body. I felt like I was floating, and the air was filled with a melody that I had heard before. My eyes grew heavy, and I knew I was supposed to be doing something other than sitting in this grass. I just couldn’t remember what. I leaned back and watched my hands glow with the light of the singers around me. I would have twirled in their song, wrapping it around me like a blanket, if I had had the energy. Instead, all I could do was smile softly, and try to hum.  I kept trying to remember what it was I was supposed to be doing. Nothing at all would come to mind. So I closed my eyes to think, and the last thing I remembered was floating on a cloud of lights, then everything went dark.

      The two cats that had been following me around earlier slunk up next to me, and wrapped their bodies around my legs. Both wound up around my body until, and from behind began nudging me with their heads. I let them nudge me to my knees, and then I slowly pushed myself off the ground. Both slithered around my feet, and walked ahead of me a few steps, and paused, looking back at me at the same time, as if they were one person, to see if I was following them.  “I’m coming,” I sighed, still unsure of why I knew I could talk to anything and everything here. I followed the twin cats for a long while, watching, as the trees seemed to glimmer while the night grew darker. The stars seemed dull compared to their leaves, and they sung quiet songs as I tiptoed down the path.   Suddenly the cats stopped. They turned to each other, and raised their front paws as if to fight, but instead, their bodies entwined around each other to form a beautiful willowy figure dressed in a gossamer dress, that shone as bright as the trees. She was gifted with long shimmery light brown hair, and fair skin. I wanted to touch her. Then she spoke to me in the harshest of tones.  “Your hair is pretty,” she said matter-of-factly as she turned pirouettes down the path and around me.  “Thank you” I said confused, I didn’t remember that she had once been a single spirit in the body of two cats. As she turned, her hair spiraled up into red streaked ringlets, like mine. Then she turned again, and her skin was no longer pale, it was a dark olive, like mine. She stopped twirling around me for a moment and walked up close to me.  “You look like you need help; do you want me to help you?” She shook her head and her hair fell out of the ringlets, and her skin was again fair as a china doll. I stared into her brown eyes, and they seemed truthful, but I wasn’t sure, because I could see a wall behind them. I had no one to trust, however, and so I accepted her help.  “Where to?” She asked dancing down the path.  “The castle…” I started.  “Down yonder. The castle, down yonder…” she trailed off into singing that phrase into the air as she danced around me.  “Are you going to help me?” I asked a little annoyed.  “Of course, I’m helping you know. See you just need to follow me,” she continued in circles around me for what seemed like months until she finally began prancing down the path. I followed her cautiously, waiting for her to spin off the road. She stopped.  “Can you dance?” she asked me raising one eyebrow.  “Yea,” I said unsure of what was to come next.  “Not better than me,” she said pretentiously.  “Why does it matter?” I asked her.  “Do you want me to help you?” She said angrily. Her clothes changed to match the pattern of my jeans and tight black t-shirt. Then they quickly shifted back to her own. She grew as tall as me, and then immediately shrunk to her own height again. Her hair kept altering from mine to hers. I looked at her strangely. Who was this girl?  “Yes I do, but I don’t see what that has to do with you helping me,” I said backing away from her. “If you weren’t going to help me in the first place, why didn’t you just say so?” She stepped up into my face.  “I’m sorry I promise I’ll help you this time, but I can’t help you if you are better than me. If you were better than me then you wouldn’t need help,” she said into my face. I stared back at her. What was she saying to me? “Well do you need help or not?” She asked again.  “Yes I need your help,” I said as she spun off again, this time towards a tree, and then she sat down beside it, and began picking at a flower.  “Come here,” she beckoned, and I sat next to her. She pinned a the ragged flower in my hair and smiled at the effect. “It’s not as pretty as mine,” she said pointing to the large red rose that appeared in her hair. Then it faded into pink, and then yellow, and then white. “Which color do you like best?”  “Red, I guess, look can you help me?” I said exasperated with this girl.  “Sure,” she said absentmindedly. I stood up, wrongly assuming she would do the same.  “Okay,” I looked down at her.  “Mhmm,” she blinked up at me innocently. “Do you think I’m pretty, because sometimes I think I am, and then sometimes I think not so much? What do you think?” I stared at her incredulously.  “You’ve promised me your help several times. Will you help me or are you just wasting my time?”  “Yes you’re wasting my time, you can go. That way,” she pointed the direction we had come, and waved her other hand making a mirror appear in her hand. She examined her reflection. “I need someone else like me, hmm,” she appeared to think for a moment, and then shook her arm off. A new one grew in it’s place, and another being grew from her arm. A boy this time, with dark hair and olive skin. He sat next to her and wrapped his arms around her.  “You are beautiful,” he said to her, “Am I?”  “Of course,” she giggled and batted her eyelashes at him. I stared at her sadly. So much for a promise. I shrugged and started heading the way I had been in the first place. I would have to do this on my own.

      The path I was on was old cobble stone, potholes everywhere. I could easily twist my ankle, so I walked slowly, with my eyes focused on the ground ahead of me. The stones were large, curved and smooth. Most were dark brown, gray, or tan, but some were a weird shade of teal. I wondered if they weren’t really stones, but eggs. I tried not to step on them in case they were, and they cracked under my weight.  I stopped for a moment to see if I was still heading towards the castle. I didn’t want to loose sight of it. I had no idea if that was even where I wanted to go. While I was staring into the beautiful, lavender horizon, something poked at my leg. I looked down again, afraid of what I might see. To my surprised, a tiny baby bird, with purple fuzz, had poked its head out of what I had correctly assumed were eggs. I immediately leaned down to pat its head. It pecked furiously at my hand, crying out in a voice far too loud for a baby bird to have.  “Shit!” I snatched my hand back, and stood up, “I’ve got to remember not to touch things,” I reminded myself, and watched as more creatures emerged. Some were different color birds, and others looked like tiny moles and rabbits. All were shades of green, blue, pink, and purple that belonged under a black light. I stepped over their heads and continued walking. There were more birds than any other creature, and they pecked at my legs. I hopped from one leg to the other to reduced the pain. The animals with arms reached out and grabbed at my feet. Trying to topple me over I tried desperately to get away.  Something grabbed a hold my shoe, and yanked hard. I fell and landed hard on top of several creatures, whom promptly hurried back into the ground. I pulled myself up in time to watch my shoe, and all the animals disappear under their eggs again. I took off my other shoe and threw into the woods around me.  “Argh!” I screamed. Nothing, it seemed would ever go right for me here.

      I looked back up at the sky. The sun had fallen down completely. The air was colder than ever. A glow was coming from the trees, and as I looked closer. I noticed the glow wasn’t coming from stars like I had thought. They were coming from people. These people were perched in the trees like large birds. Some high, some low. All of them looked out of the world I was presently in. None spoke, but their glassy eyes seemed to scream. I turned away to keep from crying.   A small girl with dark hair leaned back against the tree. She was a pale blue. The tree behind her was sickly, dying. Her tears shone out, frozen on her face, glowing like diamonds.  “Are you okay?” I asked  “No,” she said not looking up at me. Her hair was short, and scraggly. She scratched at her head with her arm. There was a long needle stuck deep inside a vein. A small circle of her skin was the color of the tree. The blue tint of the rest of her seemed to have ruptured from the vein the needle was in. I sucked in air hard. A branch fell from the tree.  “Please, let me take that from you,” I begged her.  “Take what?” She asked puzzled.  “The needle!” I said panicked.  “But I need it to live in the tree, you can’t have it. I want to be up there, you’re not allowed.”  “I don’t want to be in your tree! It’s dying!” I almost yelled at her. “Please let me help you…” I reached for her arm.  “No!” she snatched her arm away from me and held it close. Then she pushed the needle in deeper. “It’s not working!” She called up to the tree. It swayed in response. Decaying as it spoke. The trees around it grew larger to take away it’s space.  “You’re killing yourself,” I said softly. The girl looked up at me. Her eyes were black. ‘R’ scratched itself into the bark slowly as she stared at me.  “You’re lying. I can’t die now. I’m too young,” she said in a small voice.  “No, no. I can help you. Just let me take the needle out of your arm,” ‘I’ scratched itself next.  “If I was dying wouldn’t I know?” The white around her eyes got darker.  “Please…” I said desperately, “Please let me help you.” Her eyes were now filled in with black. ‘P’ was the last of the letters to be etched in the tree.  “I know a secret,” she said. The tears on her face reflected me many times.   “I can help you, just give me your arm. I can save you,” This time she held out her arm willingly. The needle had been shoved all the way through her skin. Nothing remained above.  “But I’m already dead,” she said finally, staring at me, her black eyes probing my soul. The blue in her skin darkened slightly. Wings sprouted from her back. Her body lifted heavily into the air as her wings flapped. I stepped back not knowing what to think as the tree she had been at sunk into the ground leaving nothing but a pile of ashes and a small rock with her name on it.  She lowered herself slowly stepped down at the ground and a tear slowly rolled down my face, she kissed it away.  “Dream as if you’ll live forever. Live as if you’ll die today,” she whispered in my ear. Then she faded away.   I looked back up at these trees. All of the people in them were sad, trying to fly. I wanted to help them, they were all too far gone. I knew, that somehow, I was going to be one of them if I didn’t move. So, I started walking. A boy reached down and grabbed my hair. Another girl grabbed at my shirt. I started running. Arms dropped out of the trees grabbing at me.  “But you need a tree.”  “How can you live on the ground.”  “Come up here, up high, with us,” They all called at me. I ran faster. I didn’t want a tree. I needed out of the forest. A path unwound itself a little farther on. I ran until I reached it. Then I slowed to a steady walk.   The trees here were normal, no people were hanging out of them. I sighed and looked down the path. A long way off, I could see a castle, well the top of it really. I didn’t know if that was what I was aiming for, but at least it was something. So I walked towards the castle, trying to never let it leave my sight.   Author's Note: This post dedicated to the memory of Tracy Crosset (September 29, 1986 - April 11, 2004) she died from a heroin overdose.

      I turned and stumbled out the door, immediately walking. I got about five steps, before I noticed that wherever I stepped, springy, soft, green grass grew swiftly under my feet. I picked up one foot, and placed it carefully in front of me. Immediately I was standing on grass again.  I turned around quickly and stared at the place my house had been standing. Now there was nothing but trees. They were tall, and thick, visibly growing taller by the second. I stood in awe wondering if I was really watching vines creep slowly up those trees. I felt small, and I wanted to go back to my once comforting room.  I started running, and crashed through the brush. I ran until I couldn’t breathe, and then flopped down on the ground. I tried to catch my breath.   Leaning back on the tree, I looked up. It was hopelessly tall, and an odd color. Not just brown, it was light tan, and thick. I reached my hand up and pushed myself up. The grass had grown to my waist. I swam through it, feeling the grass quiver around me. I was enjoying myself. I spun in circles and looked up. The sky was a lavender color, and the sun was a deep red. It was going down.  Goodbye , it seemed to whisper.  “Goodbye sun! Hello moon!” I called into the air. “Hello stars, hello night!” Then I fell.  “Ouch!” I screeched, as I landed on a rock. That brought me back to reality. I was in a forest, at night, nowhere near my house, with no idea what was happening to me. The air grew cold around me, and the wind whipped around the grass, creating a cool blanket for me. I stood up. I couldn’t just lie there; I had to find home, or a way out of this. I began to shiver…Where the hell was I?

      The first thing I heard when I got downstairs was the high pitched squealing of a pig. I turned quickly hoping to dear God that there weren’t pigs flying in my house, I just wasn’t ready for that. Unfortunately what I saw was much worse. The two girls who had tormented me most in elementary and middle school were sitting on my couch.  Hilary, the shorter rounder girl, somewhat resembled a pig with bleach blonde hair. She had tanned herself to the brink of bacon, and it was her I heard squealing. She was wearing a mini skirt, and a shirt much to tight for her. It was hard to believe her when she claimed she was just “big boned.” That girl was down right porky, and there was no denying it.  Cassandra had been the one to make Hilary laugh. She was tall, gangly, and looked much like a tall grasshopper with freckles and light red hair. She had tried to bleach it out, but to no avail, that girl’s stringy red locks shone right through all the dyes. She sat with her arms crooked at her sides, making it look as if she was ready to hop off at any moment. Which was exactly what she did when she noticed me.  “What are you doing here?” She demanded. I stared at her like she was nuts. “Answer me!”  “I live here. What are you doing here?” I challenged. “I don’t know if Jack told you, but the party must stay on his side of the fence, you need to get out of my house. Now.”  “Stupid, we know you live here,” Hilary said callously. “We live here too. Cass meant what are you doing out of your room. You’re not supposed to be out here if mother’s not home,” I froze. Had by some horrible twist of fate had my dream landed me as sisters with these to witches. I wanted to kill them both. I imagined running a knife clear through the fleshy skin above Hilary’s knee, and then right through Cass’s stomach.  “You bitch!” Cass screamed at me, “How dare you! Mother’ll have your head!” My mouth dropped open. “That’s right, I know what you’re thinking, don’t think we don’t. So go back up stairs and lock your door. If you even try to hurt us, Mother will kill you.”  “I’m not going back to my room, and the both of you are getting out of my house,” For just a moment Hilary scrunched up her face, and a snout popped right out of where her nose had been; then it was gone. Her hand flew to her face to see if what I saw was true.  “Liar. Go upstairs.” She stood up and flounced right up next to Cassandra, who was hunched over, her skin was flickering green. Both were glaring at me.  “Get out!” I shouted, the house shook, and Hilary fell on the floor. She squealed and shook her hands and feet flailing in the air while she tried to get up. For a moment her feet looked like a pigs. I laughed.  “Shut up!” Cassandra shot at me. Her skin was now a permanent green.  “Get up, Pig, and get out.” Hilary sat up and glared at me. Then she noticed her feet.  “Ah, ah, ah…Cassandra, get them off me! Look what she’s done! Help me,” and then she saw her sister. “Oh my god! You’re turning into a bug!” Hilary scooted across the floor as quickly as she could to get away from her. Cassandra rushed to the nearest mirror.  “What did you do to us?” She bellowed.  “I didn’t do anything!” Wings began slowly sprouting out of her back. Hilary’s snout was now stuck. She was squealing more than ever, she kicked her poor little piggy feet in an effort to make them disappear. I couldn’t decide whether she was more afraid of herself or Cassandra. Cassandra was tearing at her wings with her hands which were slowly becoming permanently bent into the forearms of a grasshopper. Suddenly I couldn’t help it, and I began to laugh.  “If you don’t turn us back…” Cassandra trailed off, all she could do know was make chirping noises with the backs of her legs, and she was doing so furiously trying to convey her message. I was laughing even harder.  “Help me, please. Somebody help.” Hilary was crying, her body was still intact, but her face had completely changed. It still looked like her, but a little less burnt, and without all the hair. “I’m sorry,” she sobbed. I stopped laughing and stared at the two. Both were helpless. Cassandra’s head and neck stuck onto the body of a grasshopper. I stared at them for a long time. Cassandra furiously rubbing her back two legs together, and Hilary holding her piggy face in her piggy hands squealing and crying. It felt good to see the two of them hurt like they had hurt me in the past, but I was still upset for them.  Finally I turned away, I didn’t want to feel pity for them. They were evil, and I never wanted to feel any emotion towards them. So I left hoping that I wouldn’t have to deal with them again. It was hard enough just trying to convince myself this was a dream without the two of them causing problems.

      “Oh God, what is going on?” I said softly hoping that nothing answered me. I knew I had to go somewhere, and do something, but I didn’t know what it was I was supposed to be doing.  The keys to my car were glowing faintly on my desk, so I figured I might as well try and drive to wherever it was I was supposed to go. I reached out for my keys, and just as I got close enough to grab them, they slid onto the floor. I ignored the fact that nothing was there to make them fall, and bent down to pick them up. This time, they rolled across the room.  “Okay, what the hell is this?” I said to them. They didn’t respond to me, although I did hear the faint sound of laughter coming from their direction. My parents hadn’t left their cars at home, so I needed to get these keys, and I wasn’t planning on chasing them down the hallway.  “Come here,” I demanded hoping against all hope that they would hop into my hands. No such luck, they scooted out my door. I sighed, and leaned against the wall.  Okay , I thought, I  just need to breathe and walk quietly out my door and grab the keys.  So I counted to ten, and walked sideways out of my room, my back pressed against the wall. Silently, I lowered myself to the floor. With one swift move, I snatched up my keys.  “Yes!” I shouted pumping my fists in the air, and then something bit me. Then again, and once more as hard as something could possibly bite me.   “Fuck!” I screamed, and dropped the keys. I held my hand in the other and stared down at it. There were three sharp incisions where it looked as if the keys had dug themselves deep into my skin. “What the hell am I supposed to do now?” I screamed at the ceiling. My keys snickered, and rolled off the edge of my balcony. I wasn’t planning on picking them up again, so I figured I might as well walk. I headed down the stairs, and straight for the door.

      By the time I had gotten back inside, I had started to notice things were different. Everything in my house had somehow gotten bigger, and if it was even possible, louder. There was a faint humming noise coming from my room too, and as I got closer, it intensified. Slowly, with each step, I began to distinguish different songs in the jumbled up mess that was the noise. But the closer I got, the faster they got, until all I could hear was screeching. As soon as I was in my room, I noticed that the screeching was coming from the flower-shaped rugs on my floor.  “I’m insane, this is insane…I’m crazy. No I’m dreaming…” I tried to calm myself down, it wasn’t working, and the noises weren’t helping. I covered my ears to drown out the noise, and tried to walk backwards out of my room. Any movements I made just made the noise worse, I was weighted to the floor, and if I took one more step, I was sure I was going to explode.  “STOP IT!” I screamed shutting my eyes as tightly as they would close. The notes danced across my eyelids turning cartwheels and flip-flops. I stared entranced at their gracefulness, and then I noticed that the noise had stopped. My eyes flew open. There, sitting on my window seat, was what appeared to be a bum. He looked as if he wasn’t any taller than my hip, and his skin was a dark chocolate. He had long dreadlocks, and a perfectly shaped goatee. His clothes were green, brown, and baggy; they looked like they hadn’t been washed in ages, and the fact that they were the color of dirt didn’t help much either. His eyes were closed and there was a quiet bubbling noise in the room as he inhaled smoke from his glossy, green bong.  “Stop what?” He asked me calmly when he finished, looking up at me from behind a pair of thick-rimmed, square shaped glasses.   “Who the fuck are you?” I asked staring at him my eyes as wide as they would go.  “No my friend, the question is who do you think I am,” he stood up and walked towards me. “You see, a wise man once said, ‘The way we imagine ourselves to appear to another person is an essential element in our conception of ourselves. In other words, I am not what I think I am, and I am not what you think I am. I am what I think you think I am.’” I looked down at him stunned, was this thing really talking to me? I had no idea what the hell was going on.  “You are clearly a figment of my imagination, I’m dreaming. I have to be…I’ll wake up, and this will all be over. Because you’re not real, and my rugs aren’t singing. This is obviously a really weird dream,” I rationalized. I sat down and leaned my head against my dresser, covering my head with my hands.  “If that’s what you think,” he walked over to my big comfy chair and sat down in it. The chair engulfed his tiny-ness. He inhaled again, and blew the smoke out the nose. It curled up underneath and drew shadows in the air. A bird appeared and flew through my window. “I think you are just scared. Relax, breathe, feel the air, and realize what you came here to do. What is your purpose?” I stared at the ground for a long time as I breathed in deeply, why was I listening to this, this leprechaun? However, the breathing was relaxing me, maybe it was the smoke, and maybe it wasn’t, but I was calming down.  “My purpose,” I said with a sigh, “is to finish my English paper,” I stared at my computer screen. There were flying toasters on it, which I knew wasn’t my screen saver. One of the pieces of toast buttered itself and jumped in the toaster. Another hopped into a pot of jam. I shook my head and looked at the leprechaun, whom I had decided to call Bob. “I’m obviously not going to be able to do that now, because my computer has gone insane too.”  “Do you think you’re insane?”  “Yes.”  “Well I don’t think you’re insane, this is all very real.”  “Real compared to what? This is nothing but a dream! And you’re nothing but a leprechaun in my head.”  “Well I’m not in your head. I seem to be sitting on a rather comfortable chair,” he blew a ring of smoke at me. It crowned itself on my head. I shook my head in an effort to remove it, and stared at him.  “Well if you’re real, why are you here, in my room, talking to me?”  “To help you realize your path. You have something that needs completing, and if it’s not done soon, you’ll end up like me my friend.”  “Like you?” I snorted, and the crown jumped, “A poor, destitute, cracked out, leprechaun giving people advice they didn’t ask for.”  “Don’t play games. This is no laughing matter. Stand up!” Something in his voice made me jump to my feet. I stood rigid waiting for him to tell me what to do. “Think hard, my friend, what is it you need the most?”  “An explanation.”  “Of what?”  “Of you.”  “I am of no concern,” he blew smoke out the side of his mouth, it curled up to the ceiling as if he was a chimney.  “How can I trust you then?”  “My story is quite simple. I had a path too, except I wandered off. Tricked by a dumb white rabbit. I ended up like this. Now unless you want to end up giving people advice they don’t ask for the rest of your life, I suggest you listen,” he stared at me, inhaling more. I stared back waiting for him to speak again. Years flew by in time. Hours twirled around minutes, making them seem longer. My internal clock stopped.  “Listen to what?” I asked. He held his finger to his lips.  “Shhh, to your heart,” he closed his eyes. I followed suit.  “Love,” came a deep, resounding voice from my chest. It rang aloud enough for the world to hear.  “What?” I asked, “What does that mean?”  “It means that by 11:45 if you have not found the one you love, and told him so, you’ll take my place. Forever,” he blew smoke at me creating a wall between the two of us.  As soon as the smoke cleared, I looked back at the place where my leprechaun had been sitting, he was gone.  “Hello?” I asked weakly. “Shit, what am I supposed to do now?” I sank back down and then immediately jumped back up. “Hey, wait a minute! 11:45? Even Cinderella got until midnight!” 	  His voice called out to me in laugher “Yes, but this isn’t a fairy tale my friend, this is real.”  “What am I supposed to do?” I asked the room. His voice answered me again, except this time fading softly.  “Find the path, follow your heart…”

      I sat down on the flimsy lawn chair and finished the last of my drink. Then I pulled off my tennies, they were sadly in need of repair. I’d had this particular pair of converse since the eighth grade. I refused to give them up, much like the pair of jeans that I was now wearing as shorts. I pulled those off to and dove into the pool. I looked back and checked to see where Jack was. It looked like he had retreated into his smoky land of escape, and I was glad. Sometimes he made me nervous.  I swam back and forth letting time and all my worries flow away from me like the water at my sides. Slowly I began to feel much better, and soon I thought I was ready to tackle my English assignment.  I climbed out of the pool and began to towel off. Suddenly, a small black cat was at my feet. It didn’t look like either of mine, so I bent down to see if there was a collar.  “Poor kitty, kitty, don’t you have a home?” I asked it, relying on the fact that it wouldn’t respond. It looked up at me, its large green eyes begging, and put its front paws on my knees.   “How cute,” I smiled and scratched the top of its head. “I bet you’re hungry, huh? Do you want something to eat?” Call me crazy, but the cat nodded its head at me. So I stood back up to go get it the pan my cats used for food.  I walked silently to my garage, watching as the shadows morphed aimlessly into frightening shapes. I stopped for a second, and waited for someone to jump out of the shadows and grab me. I stood there, for what seemed like forever, as the music and smoke from the party sifted through into my yard creating a whirlwind of smells and sounds. Slowly my bad feeling slid away, and I enjoyed the little bit of Marley and Sublime I could hear.   I bent down to pick up the bowl. To my surprise, the cat was already there.  “Wow, you’re faster than my kitties,” I scratched the top of its head again and headed back over to the pool. Curious, I wondered at the cats abilities, Is it even real? I asked myself, and then I shook my head to empty it of the booming noise I’d made there.  I started walking to my clothes when I stepped on something hard. The cat hissed at me as I jumped off its tail.  “Oh! I’m sorry,” I bent down to pet him, when another one came from behind me. “There’re two,” I marveled aloud. The one that had just appeared slinked towards me. Just as I reached out to pet it, it slashed me with its claws. I yelped, and jumped back, right into my pool.  I sank to the bottom, watching the bubbles I had created with my breath. I swam back up to the top swiftly. So much for drying myself off. I hoisted myself onto the side and sat down. Both the cats were gone. I breathed a sigh of relief, although I wasn’t quite sure why.

      I sat at my computer trying to think of something to write. Usually writing was a release for me, but not tonight. Tonight all I could think about was Rocky. Rocky, with his blonde hair and tall frame. Rocky, who could make me smile with a wink. I could tell nothing I did was going to take my mind off him, and since nobody was home, I finally decided to go for a swim.  I got outside and found my neighbor, Jack, lounging around in his yard with friends. A couple of them were sitting in a circle passing a joint around, and a few more were trying to do keg stands. Some were sitting around a table containing a platter of categorically questionable brownies. Jack sauntered up to the fence and leaned over brushing his floppy brown hair out of his eyes. I liked to call them “stoner bangs.” He thought of himself as a heart breaker, and sometimes even hit on me, but because he was two years younger, it’s a bit hard to take him seriously.  “Hey babe, come hang with us,” he waved me over to the fence giving me the once over silently. I was glad I’d worn shorts over my bikini.  “Actually, I just came out to do a few laps because I can’t think,” I draped my towel over the edge of the fence, “Besides I’m not much of a party girl,” I nodded to the group passing the joint and started to walk away.  “Oh come on, at least have a beer, that’ll help you unwind,” he opened the gate.  “Okay, I guess I’ll stay for a lil bit,” I knew his mom was across the street, probably screwing around with her boyfriend. That’s why Jack and his sister, Cameron, did the stuff they did. Their mom had cheated on their dad when Jack was around ten, with their across-the-street neighbor. Cammie was somewhere in the yard either smoking or making out with her boyfriend no doubt. She was only thirteen. Which was only a year older than Jack was when he started. I worried about them both, but they didn’t listen to me.  “Sit down, and take a load off,” he handed me a red plastic cup filled to the brim, and walked over to the guys at the keg to tell them to cool it.  “Hey there,” a guy in dreads said from across the table. He was in my grade, so I wondered momentarily why he was hanging out over here. Until he offered me a brownie.  “Depends, is there anything in ‘em besides flour, milk, eggs, and sugar?”  “Yea, well, um, there’s chocolate too,” he said with a shrug and took one off the top.  “Yea, no thanks,” I sipped on my beer for a while inhaling the smoke around me. After a few minutes, I decided I had better get out of there before I somehow ended up in the circle. Besides, I still had that essay to write.  “Hey, wait,” Jack grabbed my arm.  “Yea?”  “Close your eyes and open your mouth,” he said sweetly. I knew better than to do that around here. I might end up OD-ing on acid or something.  “No way, not at this house,” I pulled his hand off my arm and walked away.  “Whoa, babe, check it out,” he opened his hand and showed me a valentine’s cookie, with a little red heart on top. I’d helped his sister bake a batch of them for her English class.  “I have a name you know.”  “Yea, whatever, you want it?” He held his hand out again, and I thought about it for a moment and vaguely remembered something about consequences for a certain Alice when she ate some unmarked cookies.  “Is there weed in it?” I asked incredulously.  “No,” he replied pushing his hand forward.  “Okay, night Jack,” I went through the gate, and got ready to swim.

      Immediately a throng of whirling colors and masks swept me away. I stared at the beauty around me, and took note of the hundreds of mirrors reflecting the coupled dancers around and around the room. Even with their faces masked hideously, they were devastatingly beautiful.  The doors swished shut behind me just as the music ended. The couples on the dance floor bowed and clapped graciously. I looked around shyly trying to find the musicians that had played such a heavenly tune, but they had hidden themselves well. So instead, I looked for the Prince.  I found his family at the head of the room. The royal family all had masks of gold, silver, or bronze, and none of them was unsightly. The Prince’s mother, the Queen, stood pompously behind him, next to his mouse of a father, the King. The Queen was thin and gorgeous. She had the makings of a beauty queen with a cascade of thick red curls piled on top of her head so you could barely see her crown. The King was taller, and just as thin. He looked as if he needed a good shampooing his hair was so thin, oily, and dark. What strange twist of fate that had brought these two together I couldn’t even imagine.   Their son, the Prince, had managed, however, to be quite dashing, but not too proud. He stood tall and firm ahead of his parents, and at the front of a long line of ladies vying for a dance with him. His skin was tan, and his body was toned, and he had a head full of dark shiny hair just long enough to brush across his brow. He bowed for every gentlewoman he met but he took none to dance.   I stared long and hard, knowing he wouldn’t turn to look at me. I was dead wrong. His piercing green eyes took me in for a long moment, and my heart stopped beating. He was even more entrancing than the man I had danced with in the field. He nodded, and then turned back to his line of ladies.  “A dance m’lady,” said a voice from behind me. I turned to stand toe to toe with one of the musicians. Only his head, hands, and feet were visible. I gaped at him not quite knowing what to say.  “She’s here to dance with the Prince friend,” another mocked as he joined him, “she’ll not even look at us.”  “Well I can’t see you!” I cried backing away from them.  “How will you dance m’lady? Will you have a waltz? or a foxtrot? or maybe a tango?” Said the first. The musicians played a different tune to match his words. Nobody in the room noticed, they just changed their steps to match the music.  I turned around hoping to escape the leering musicians, when another one stepped into my path.  “It’s just one dance, m’lady? Won’t you dance?” He smirked at me, and I realized they were surrounding me. Frightened of them all, I shrunk down onto my knees as they circled me like sharks.  “Why are you down here?” asked another voice, much kinder in my ear. I looked up. I was stunned when I realized it was the Prince kneeling next to me, and not another unwanted minstrel.  “The musicians, they were surrounding me, and they were…” I trailed off; his eyes were more dazzling up close. He hid his face with a silver mask engraved with Celtic designs, but you could still see most of his tan face. He looked around me confused.  “You can see them? Honestly, I’ve never met a courtier that could see them. You are very special. Oh, what I’d give to see them,” He turned too look back at me and then helped me up.  “Well I could see part of them, at least,” I looked around me, searching for any sign of them, even just their instruments. No part of them remained, except for the music, which changed to a soft melody as the lights around us dimmed.  “A dance?” He asked softly, and I saw a light blush cover his cheeks and chin. I grinned shyly. The music changed again, and he swept me into his world of colors.

      I opened the door at the end of the hallway, and shut it carefully behind me. The room, in which I now stood, whirled in a circle around me in a blur of colors. The doors were all the same, and I had no way of knowing which door was the one I was supposed to open. I walked to the center and suddenly felt like I was falling. I reached out and grabbed at the air to steady myself.  Looking up at the doors, I decided that I would eventually have to go through one. But I would have to decide which first. I counted from the door in front of me to the third one and walked up. I leaned in to peek into the hole.  “Not that one!” The voices kept coming out of the air in this place.  “Why not?” I challenged.  “Well you see three is always a bad number. If you go for that one, you’re walking into certain death.”  “Oh really, and you wish to keep me from dying?” I twisted around trying to find the voice.  “Well to put it simply, yes.”  “Where are you?” I didn’t like being watched; I always had that feeling here. A mouse scurried across my foot, and I jumped. The hands on the grandfather clock to my right whirled faster than my head. I walked to the door across from the one I where I was. I peeked in the peephole, and I saw a mirror on the other side.  “Can I go in this one?” I asked the room.  “If you want,” I felt the room shrug.  “I won’t die if I go in this one will I?” I put my hand on the knob, and waited for the answer.  “There’s always a chance of dying, but I don’t think you will in there.”  “Thank you,” I called out and walked inside the door.   There was a full-length mirror in front of me. I stood staring a moment at my face, and then I put the mask on. I smiled at the hidden face in front of me. I turned around, and the door was gone. I had no way of getting back into the talking room, so I decided to see what was behind the mirror. I didn’t get the chance. The room tilted, and I slid quickly down into a hole in the floor. A long, blue, and loopy slide lay before me. I couldn’t stop myself at all. I screamed.  Suddenly I was aware that I was shooting past stars and planets in this long black tunnel. I stopped screaming, and reached my arm out. A handful of stardust came off onto my hands, and I poured it onto my head, laughing. The stars began shooting by me slower, and I saw a light below me. I tried to stop myself with my feet. It was too late; I crashed, with a thud, into a matching pair of large, oak double doors.  Standing up, I dusted myself off, and checked for any rips. There were none, nor did I have any bruises. I adjusted my mask, and reached out for the door handle. The doors both swung open at my touch.

      It was harder than I had imagined getting across the field to the castle. Especially because I kept looking over my shoulder, hoping that the man would reappear.  “You’ll never get anywhere that way,” a voice said in front of me. I whirled around quickly and the castle seemed to have jumped in front of me.  “What do you mean?” I asked searching for the body that belonged to the voice. A tall gangly man, with a black oversized jacket over a gray vest and white shirt, was slouching on the steps. His top hat was pulled down low over his shaggy hair, and his pants were baggy as well. A silver pocket watch chain hung at his side.  “Well, you keep looking back; you want to go forward right?” He unfolded himself and pulled the hat off his head. Two long tan rabbit ears sprung up, and I saw a matching pair of whiskers attached to a rabbit’s nose. I gasped and took a step backwards.  “Oh, so you do want to go that way. Well if you’re going to walk in that direction, turn around and do it. Walking backwards only confuses you.”  “No, I don’t, I mean…I do want to go that way,” I pointed to the castle, “it’s just, you startled me,” he pulled out is watch, glanced at it, and put it away.  “Hmm,” he sighed lazily putting his hat back onto his head. “Did I scare you then?” He leaned closer and sneered. “Well you’re going to be late.”  “Late! For what?” I said leaning away from him.  “The masquerade, the ball, the dance,” he was spinning around dancing with imaginary partners. The he latched onto me, “Every young woman comes in disguise to kiss the prince and marry him.” He spun me in a circle and caught a hold of me again. He dipped me, his face coming perilously close to mine. “Isn’t that why you’re here?” He righted me, stood back, and bowed. “Me lady.”  “I, um, I dunno. I guess so…” I stammered, flustered, and blushing. Was it the prince I’d come to kiss?  “Well then, madam, go. Go kiss your prince. Go win his heart, and the hearts of the people in your kingdom,” he pulled open the door, and motioned for me to enter. “Hurry down to the ball, but first,” he stopped me before I could leave. I turned to face him anxiously. “Don’t forget your mask!” He pointed to a basket full of them next to the door and I stooped to find one. I grabbed a black feathered one, and began to walk down the hallway.

      I stared ahead at the castle, hitched my skirt, and started to move on. The grass brushed around my ankles and cushioned my shoe-less feet. It felt much softer than I had imagined it to be. The air around me was warm, and I could feel music in my body picking up. The grass swayed with the breeze, and a tune was playing off the blades. I smiled as I watched the tips turn gold where the wind touched, and then as they turned back to green.   As I walked on, a dance began to build in my toes, and I twirled once, and then twice, and then a third time. No longer was the castle the only thing ahead of me. Right in front of me was a wooden dance floor surrounded by white lights had appeared on top of a small hill dipping not ten feet before the castle. I was sure that it hadn’t been there before I had spun. I froze and stared unblinkingly at the man standing in the middle of the floor dancing by himself to the music I was hearing. I was still clutching my when he turned to face me.  “If you came for the lesson, you need to hurry over here, the ball starts in ten minutes,” his voice rang out strong and husky, and his blonde hair fell around his face not quite long enough to pull away. I suddenly had the feeling in the pit of my stomach that I was four years old, and my face heated.  “Come on,” he reached his hand out, and motioned for me to come closer. I walked over and grabbed it. He laced his fingers in between mine, and pulled me closer. I grew increasingly aware of how close we were, and the intoxicating smell he gave off. I breathed in deeply as we began to move.  His eyes were clear, and the same color of the grass around the floor. His hand moved into the small of my back, and slight pressure there told me I was slouching.  “You are too tense, just relax. Let me lead,” he spun me out and then pulled me back in quickly. Our hips connected tightly, and his hand found my back again.  “How are you so good at this?” I asked feeling like I didn’t need to even reach the castle.  “I practice,” he stared into my eyes, and my knees weakened. He pulled me in tighter to keep me from falling. “You are better than most who come here to learn.” The music was keeping time with my heart speeding up the closer I was to him. Leaning my head on his shoulder, I closed my eyes and imagined staying here. The breeze picked up, and I shivered.  His hand wrapped tighter around my waist. The cold was banished from my body. I picked my head back up, and looked into his eyes again, I forgot time again, and then he leaned in to kiss me. His arms found my shoulders, and then my neck. Time stopped briefly as I imagined the floor sinking away from me.  The music faded. The breeze ran cold through me again. I opened my eyes to an empty field, and a castle to my left. I blinked around me, not expecting the dance floor, or the man to come back. I knew that nothing good would stay around me for long. So, I wrapped my arms around my body again to keep out the cold, and trekked down the hill, feeling truly alone in the pit of my stomach.

      “Shh, don’t wake her, if you do then we don’t get her shirt!” said a whiney voice from behind me. I had the strange feeling of something tickling my ribs. I swatted at whatever it was and adjusted my head on my elbow. I didn’t want to move.  “What the hell happened to her shoes?” I heard another voice say. There was something pulling at my legs. I kicked my legs a bit and continued to sleep. Suddenly I realized just who was standing over me. I jumped away and shrunk back as far as possible.  “You two stay away from me,” I said wishing I had a stick or something. I felt the cold breeze and suddenly wished for a jacket.  “We don’t want you, silly goose,” Hilary said, “Cassandra just needs your pants now, I’ve already got what I want.” She held up my black short-sleeved turtleneck and giggled. I wanted to smash her little piggy nose in, but instead, I covered myself up. Suddenly, Cassandra snuck up beside me, grabbed my hips and yanked. I jumped away and unintentionally out of my pants as well.  “Look here, you two need to give me back my pants,” I stared at them virtually naked. I could imagine nothing worse than Hilary shoving herself into my shirt and Cassandra prancing around in my favorite jeans. Neither one said anything; they just turned and began walking away.   In my head a whirlwind of thoughts processed in a second. I lost my mind, everything in this place had been toying with my patience, all I wanted to do was to wake up in my own bed. None of that was going to happen, so I flew at the two girls holding my clothes and used Hilary for a landing mat. She screamed.  “Get off me!” she huffed flailing her arms and doing her best to flip me off her back. I grabbed a hunk of hair and ripped. She screamed yet again. Cassandra was behind me again, pulling me off Hilary and yanking at my hair. I reached back and wrapped my arms around her tiny waist, and flipped her over my shoulder. I smacked her in the face to give her a warning, and continued pulling at Hilary’s hair. Suddenly, Bob was in front of me, telling me to get off her. He sat down in the lotus position, and closed his eyes.  “Do you mind, my friend, telling me what you are doing?” He breathed.  “Getting my clothes back,” I said standing up. I didn’t feel as self-conscious with him near me. He opened his eyes and looked at me, then shoed the two girls off with a flick of his wrist. My clothes disappeared with them.  “Hey! Now I don’t have any clothes to wear.”  “Material things don’t matter, only what lies within.”  “I want clothes,” I said defiantly. I was tired of his bullshit answers. He stood up, and walked towards me, climbing a set of invisible stairs as he did, so he came face to face with me.  “Well then, wear some.”  “I don’t have any to wear, you just let the two nastiest… …things in the world run off with mine!”  “You seem just fine to me,” he leaned in closer, “but if you insist upon wearing clothes, then just wear them.”  “For the last time, I don’t have any to wear!” I flung my arm up in exasperation, and a dark piece of cloth caught my eye. I stared down at my body, and a slim scarlet dress with a low neckline and short draped sleeves covered my body. My hair had been pulled up, and a scarlet begonia was tucked behind my ear. I still had no shoes. I stared back up at my Bob, and smiled.  “Thank you, I'm much less malicious when I have clothes on.”  “I didn’t do anything,” he turned and walked away, towards the horizon. His legs faded away slowly. His turned around and looked at me, “Remember, you don’t have all night my friend…” he said sadly, and then the rest of his body faded away too.

      I was right. Time had been kind enough to slow around me for the fall, and The Prince caught me easily. I opened my eyes as soon as I felt his strong arms around me. I stared into his green eyes while he set me down gently. Half of me questioned what I was feeling. The other half said to kiss him. But how could I possibly want to kiss the empty-headed Prince I had only just met? Love at first sight had never been real to me. Was I just going to throw that faith away? I didn’t even know his name.   While these loud, bothersome thoughts jabbered on in my head, I never let go of the Prince. I never looked out of his eyes. My body and brain continued working in different directions for unknown lengths of time. My heart argued with my brain, but no part of me heard it or cared. I just stood with my arms around the Prince, not listening to the war caused by my own inner turmoil. A gong sounded somewhere off in the distance, and the argument inside me ceased. The earth beneath us dropped a few inches, and I held on tighter to the Prince to keep my balance. He steadied me with his hands on my back.  “What do people call you?” I asked him cautiously.  “Prince, Highness, Sir,” he said unthinkingly. The sky opened, and a flash of light swept over us. Rain poured down gently, soaking us both through our clothes. I held on tightly to him to keep some warmth in my body.  “You mean, you have no name?” How could I love or even like someone who didn’t have a name.   “Oh, my name,” he said as if he hadn’t thought or heard of it in years. “My name, is Zeke.” Then I smiled and leaned in, and we kissed.  His hands pulled me in tight, and I wrapped my arms around his neck. I could feel our chests pushed in tightly together, and the beating of our hearts synchronized. We turned so my back was on the tree, and one of his hands cradled my face as we kissed. The other ran a finger across my stomach, sending a sweet sensation up through my spine to my chest, and down to my hips. I sighed and broke away. I leaned my head into his neck, and he put his hands on my shoulders. I smiled and looked at the sky. It had frozen with the clouds parted to let out a bolt of lightning that had never come. The rain had stopped in mid-air, not bothering to fall all the way to the ground. I lifted my arm, to see my watch. The face had shattered, and the hands were gone. The world had stopped for one single kiss, and I had thought romance was only hallucination.

      I was so angry that I started walking as fast as I could without running. The Prince was calling after me, and I moved faster to get away from the sound of his voice. However, being angry was taking a toll on me, and I was wearing myself out by walking so quickly.   Soon I found a pond near a tree, so I decided to sit down to catch my breath. That’s when I noticed that everything had grown smaller the as I walked away from it. I could now pick a flower and put it in my hair, instead of leaning on it. The furry gray cat I had run into earlier jumped into my lap, and I laughed stroking it gently.  “Hello kitty kitty, how are you?” I asked it, fully expecting a response. This time, none came. “What’s the matter kitty? Don’t you like me?” I picked him up and turned him so his eyes looked into mine. The cat blinked slowly, and then yawned. I set him down, and he ran off. It looked as if I had finally found a normal creature in this nightmarish wonderland of sorts.  Leaning over to get a drink out of the pond, I noticed my reflection had changed. My hair wasn’t just hanging down my back anymore. Somehow, it had managed to get itself into two braids. My bangs hung down in my eyes, and I quickly felt my head to see if what I was seeing was true. My hair had changed, but the girl in the pond didn’t. She didn’t seem to move when I did.  “Hey, aren’t you supposed to be my reflection?” I spouted quickly.  “Aren’t you supposed to be doing an English paper?” She responded. I sucked in air, and stared down in bewilderment. “Don’t do that,” she said, “You look horrible when you bug out your eyes like that, put them back into your head like a normal girl.” I blinked and stared at her, and then I saw the Prince next to me.  “It tells you things you know,” he said. His reflection’s mouth didn’t move, but instead nodded when he was done talking. I looked up at him. He was back in his formals, and he handed me a yellow flower. I smiled bashfully and thanked him.  “You’re running out of time girly,” said my reflection.  “I am?” I said shocked.  “Yes you are.”  “Well how was I supposed to know? My watch isn’t working!” I shoved out my wrist and showed her the swirling hands. She leaned forward and stared for a second.  “It seems to be working just fine,” she crossed her arms. I looked at my watch. It now showed the time to be 11:35. I had ten minutes to kiss the person I loved, or I would become like Bob somehow. Who did I love? Why had my watch started working just now? How was I going to get out of all this? Nothing made any sense to me. Not even when I thought about it all backwards.  The Prince’s reflection leaned in and whispered to me, “He might love you; you’re the only one here that is just pretty as he is.”  “Thank you,” my reflection turned and said to him. I looked up at the Prince, who was currently trying to climb up the tree to get a pear. I laughed at him. He had no idea how to get up it. He was completely spoiled by his royalty.  “Can I help you?” I asked him.  “No I’m fine just hang on to something,” he said.  “What do you mean hang on?” He stood for a second with his hands on his hips, and then shook his head disbelievingly. Then the world flipped on me. I screamed and reached for the thing nearest to me to keep from falling up into the sky. I caught myself on the branch and looked up. The pond was there in perfect shape. Not a drop had fallen out, but my reflection had disappeared.  The Prince kept his balance, and then walked on the branch over to the edge. He picked the pear he wanted and then jumped back down. The world flipped again, and I swung around so that my feet were facing the ground.  “A little help?” I asked the Prince, who sat cross-legged biting into his juicy pear.  “Sure,” he said, and ran over to where I was. He opened his arms, “Let go of the branch, I’ll catch you.”  “You promise?” I asked too scared to even look down.   “I swear I won’t let you hit the ground. I didn’t want to stay up there forever, but I wasn’t sure if I trusted him. So not sure if he would catch me, I closed my eyes and let go. Somehow, in my head it made sense that if I couldn’t see what happened, I wouldn’t get hurt. Nonsense of course, but something told me in a place where up could suddenly become down, that I was right.

      Immediately I jumped up and ran to the door I had come in. I had to get out of this place as quickly as possible. I grabbed the handle to the door and pulled as hard as I could. It wouldn’t budge. I was stuck in the god-forsaken room, and there were no other exits.  “Where are you going?” The Prince put his hand on my shoulder and I quit my relentless wrenching on the door.  “I need to get out of here,” I said not facing him.  “Why?”  “Look at me, I’m not me. I don’t belong here. I just want to go home,” I turned around and sunk to the floor. I crossed my legs and leaned my head back. The Prince sat down next to me.  “Do you really want to leave?” He asked quietly.  “Yes,” I whispered.  “Okay,” he sighed, “follow me.” The Prince grabbed my hand and pulled me up. We wound our way through the people, and to a curtain behind a row of chairs. He looked behind us quickly, and then pulled me behind it.  In front of us, was a very small black door. I bent down and pushed it open. There was barely enough space for me to crawl through, but I did. When I stood up, I was knee deep in grass. Blue and purple flowers sprouted as high as trees above me.  It was dark out, but the clouds blocked the stars from view. All I could see was the moon above me. I jumped a bit as the Prince grabbed my hand.  “Where am I?” I asked.  “The Queen’s garden,” he said shyly.  “How did she get the flowers so big?”  “You mean how did she make us so small?”  “I’m not small!” I said defiantly, “I’m five-foot-six-and-a-half thank you.”  “Well you’re certainly not very big compared to the flowers,” he said matter-of-factly. I sniffed at him and walked away. I had come out to get away from the castle and the Prince, so now was the time to find my way home. Only, I didn’t get very far because about ten steps ahead of me, a big gray cat lay in my way. He was roughly one mile in each direction, and there was no way to get over him. Angrily I stalked past the flowers and headed towards the moon.

      David Bowie crooned “Golden Years” from somewhere in the corner, no labyrinth, in my mind, would be complete without him, his incredibly tight pants, billowy shirt, and outrageous makeup.   The Prince spun me out, and my dress transformed into a pair of comfortable jeans and a burgundy tank top with lace at the top. My hair had fallen out of its up-do straight as a pin. I laughed at him curiously. He was now wearing a green-collared shirt and a pair of khakis. Neither of our masks had disappeared, nor had shoes appeared on my feet.  “How did you do that?” I asked, still laughing as the throng around us mashed together dancing wildly. Nobody was wearing formals anymore. The Prince pulled me in tight, so our hips locked. He smiled so that a row of perfectly straight pearly whites showed.  His hands flew off me and in the air. He clapped with the music, and we spun around so our backs touched. He turned and held me from behind. Our hands interlocked above my head. I turned so we faced again. Holding onto my hands, we shimmied closer together. The mob opened so that a circle formed around us. We danced around each other laughing and holding onto each other. Bowie trailed away with the music and the crowd clapped.  “You’re a great dancer,” he pulled me off the dance floor, and we wandered over to a table filled with food. More classic music played in the background.  “Thanks so are you,” I remembered briefly the girl from the wood, but shook her out of my head quickly. Hadn’t her hair been straight too? I poured myself a glass of punch, and we sat down next to the buffet table.  The King stood up in front and tried helplessly to get the crowd’s attention. Nobody but the Prince and I were watching him. Suddenly the Queen let out a sharp whistle blast and the whole room went silent.  “Th-thank you, dear,” the King said gratefully. He had an awful stutter. “Well n- now it’s time to t-take off your m-masks. And such lovely m-masks they ar-are. Ar-aren’t they, dear?”  “Yes, just wonderful,” said the Queen disdainfully.  “O-okay, well now. I’m going to count to three, then everyone will t-take their m-masks off. O-one, tw-two, three!” He said with as quickly as possible, and the entire court de-masked themselves. The King and Queen were the greatest shock to me. The king had a mouse’s snout, and the queen had a beak of a nose. Without her mask, she was much uglier than she had appeared. The King looked rather inhuman. Then I looked around the room. Everyone had dropped their masks to the floor. Once jaw-droppingly-beautiful girls were now plain, and even hideous. I breathed in sharply and turned to look at the Prince. He had managed to retain his handsomeness.  His eyes were as green as ever, and his lips just as full. I smiled at him, and looked around the room again wondering at how two repulsive parents could create such a beautiful man. The Prince found my hand and then turned my face to look at him.  “I’ve never seen anyone as beautiful as you before,” He said staring into my eyes.  “You would if you had a mirror Prince, you are quite dazzling yourself,” I smiled shyly, and looked at the ground. It reflected my face back at me, and next to it,  I saw the girl from the forest. She was scowling,  “That’s not fair!”  She mouthed. I looked from one face to the other confused. Then I shook my head and looked back up at the Prince, then something clicked in my head: I was becoming a part of this place, when all I had ever wanted to do was leave.

      I was about to kiss Prince Zeke again, when a dark figure crossed over the two of us. In that instant, the lightning flashed, the rain started pouring again, and the clouds closed together in a snap. Immediately shutting out any good feelings I had felt about the world in that instant.  Zeke turned so his back was in front of me, and stood face to face with the Queen.  “Your Majesty,” he bowed low. I wondered briefly, why he didn’t call her mother. Then the King stepped out from behind the Queens intimidating form.  “Who’s th-th-this?” The King asked leaning over to peek behind his son.  “Father this is the girl I’ve danced with all night,” He stepped aside, and bowed again. I tried my best to curtsey, but it was difficult because as I wasn’t in a dress.  “Are you a lady?” The Queen asked while opening her fan abruptly. If you were to bet that was going to use it for a light breeze even in the rain, you would have lost that bet. She held the fan over her head for a moment, and then let go. It hovered over her head, and shielded her face from getting drenched, and running her make-up down her monstrous nose.  “Well, I suppose so,” I replied, still facing the ground.  “Stand up, and let me have a look at you,” she demanded. I rose, and glanced over at the Prince, he was inching away from the Queen and his father as quietly as possible.  The Queen walked around me taking me all in. The King seemed to be moving backwards as well. I stood up as straight as possible, letting the rain soak me through, wishing for an out.  “You should be in a dress,” she hit me on the head with her fan. Now I stood wearing a burgundy dress that had a long slim skirt, and an empire waist. The straps and lace at the top of my shirt had stayed the same. My hair pulled itself up and out of my face, all except for my bangs. The Queen circled me again.  “What are you doing here?” She said harshly, sticking her nose up next to mine.   “N-now, dear, you sh-shouldn’t be so r-r-rough with the child. She’s f-f-frightened you see,” the King tried to help me. The Queen snapped him a dirty look, and he shut his mouth quickly. I stared ahead looking at nothing, and not moving. I thought for a moment and replied with the best answer I could think of.  “Just, trying to get home, your majesty,” I said honestly, trying to swallow my fear.  “Don’t you know the way?” she smirked at me, and I glanced at the Prince. He wasn’t moving backwards any more.  “Your Majesty, please don’t. I enjoy her company,” he said quickly. I turned and looked at the queen. She was still grinning ferociously.  “Don’t you want to go home darling girl?” She said without moving her lips. I nodded silently just wanting to get away from her wicked presence. She leaned on the tree, and then hit it with her fan. A piece dropped out, and a dark entry way appeared. “Well then, walk through there,” She pointed with her fan, and I followed its path unsure of what to do.  Vaguely I heard the Prince telling me to come back out of the tree, but I didn’t listen. I just wanted out of the Queen’s gaze.  I started falling fast, and I couldn’t see anything to save my life, nor could I reach for anything to hold myself up. I flipped in circles, and spun too quickly for my head to readjust itself. Without a warning, I landed in my pool again. I jerked to life as if waking from a bad dream, and in doing so inhaled what seemed like all the poorly chlorinated water in my pool.  I choked on what I had thought was air, trying to scream for help. I grew dizzy, and couldn’t move my limbs while my brain screamed for me to get out of the pool and get some oxygen. Things were growing dark again, and I could see Jack peering over the fence looking for me. I screamed at him in my head, but he couldn’t hear me. I couldn’t move my arms even to splash a warning. He turned and walked away.  Things darkened to a pitch black that I had never felt in my life. The air around me was cold. I heard a voice from somewhere in the background. I found control of my limbs again, and turned. To my surprise, I was standing out in the field of lights again. There were trees this time, and sad souls hung empty from them. I turned around taking everything in, and then I knew where I was supposed to go.  I walked straight through all the trees, and there stood the Prince waiting for me. He held me in his arms for a moment, and then the Queen stood next to the both of us. She kissed my forehead, and wings appeared from my back. I smiled, and took the Prince’s hand. Then we both flew away quietly into the dark horizon. I could see my little Bob shaking his head sadly at the bottom of the hill. I saw the girl from the tree, and the other from the forest dancing together ahead of us. I felt the loneliness of never hearing my family’s voices again. And I sighed, because I had never really gotten out of life what I had come here to find.
