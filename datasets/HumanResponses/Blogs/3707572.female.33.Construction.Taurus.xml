      As I was on my way home from dinner at Rice Noodle with my "extended family" a.k.a. my running club friends, I was flipping around the radio stations and immediately recognized the opening notes of Chicago's "You're the Inspiration." I cranked it up and belted it out with all my heart.   I was immediately transported back to the days when my fashion choices consisted of a Swatch rugby shirt, baggy Outback Red (or Forenza, or just about anything else from The Limited or Contempo Casuals) pants, slouch socks, white Esprit boots, a perfectly coordinated Esprit bookbag, and of course, a bevy of synthetic accoutrements -- including the requisite Swatch watch (or maybe two or three) and those rubbery bracelets that I'm humored to see kids wearing these days.  (And how much do I hate using the term "kids" since it makes me feel like I should be out in my front yard in a housecoat with rollers in my hair, shaking a rolling pin & saying "Get that ball out of my yard!")  Back then when I heard the crooning of Peter Cetera in any of his songs (of which I heard plenty, as my brother is perhaps the biggest Chicago fan of all time...in fact, the gift his wife gave him just before their wedding last month was a box set of Chicago CDs, which to me further reaffirmed the fact that she is absolutely 100% the one for him), I thought I knew what the songs were really about.    As the years have gone by, and I've had my share of heartbreak, there are times when I'm in the mood to hear such a song, and there are times when I'd rather have my eyelids be cut off and be forced to lay in the parking lot of Cal Expo on a hot summer day.    One such instance was a particularly bad breakup in late 1994.  It was your garden variety "we took things too quickly" relationship.  We'd professed our love to each other after only two weeks, and within about three weeks I was living with him.  Within four weeks, we joked about eloping to Tahoe on several occasions.  Within eight weeks, it was over.  I was 23, and he was 31.  At that time, I thought he was so much older and so "mature."  As a 33 year old now, I realize that we were both just pups.   It got to the point during that breakup when I couldn't avoid hearing love songs on the radio, and my collection of Depeche Mode, The Cure, The Smiths, and other "uplifting" music selections were not helping the situation.  There was only one choice.  I would play nothing but Devo's "Whip it!" until I was feeling better because it has not even a glimmer of the topic of love.  So, for a few weeks straight -- with the help of my family, friends, and my Devo tape -- I managed to perservere.  No joke.  I practically wore the tape out, and when I hear the song now, I look back at how much has changed in the last ten years since that breakup.    My heart has been truly broken only once (not with the one I just mentioned, incidentally), and for me I feel it was payback for what I had done to someone else with calling off our wedding in 1997 -- I'm certain he probably thanks me now, in all seriousness.    It was 1998 and one of those agonizing "on again/off again" deals that likely frustrated my friends and family just as much as it frustrated me.  I knew that his feelings for me were just as deep, but it wasn't in the cards for him to be with me.  His family had already decided that he would end up with someone else, and that was the way it was going to be.    I ran into him in New York City three years ago when I was there on business and he was there on a personal trip.  This was not a coincidence -- it was just a not-so-subtle reminder to me to never settle for anything but the real deal when it comes to matters of the heart (or anything else, for that matter.)    As I told my friend Nick -- whom I've known since 1979 when we moved to Auburn -- back in December of '03 (after we'd split a couple good bottles of Merlot), what I'm looking for is the person who embodies the "you" in one of my favorite songs "In my life" by The Beatles:  There are places I'll remember, all my life though some have changed. Some forever not for better, some have gone and some remain. All these places have their moments, with lovers and friends I still can recall. Some are dead and some are living, in my life I've loved them all.  But of all these friends and lovers, there is no one compares with you, and these memories lose their meaning, when I think of love as something new. Though I know I'll never lose affection, for people and things that went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them, in my life I love you more.  Though I know I'll never lose affection, for people and things that went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them, in my life I love you more.  In my life I love you more. *******  Luckily, I've never attached this song to another person, so I'm still able to listen to it and still love it.  I do hear it at the oddest moments, such as getting on the bus to head to the starting line for my first marathon in 2001 -- when there was a torrential storm that had kept me awake all night long with the heavy winds and sheets of rain.  I took it as a sign that all was well, and that I would do great.  I went on to finish with a respectable time (though I took more than 25 minutes off my time the next year and was very close to breaking 4:00, then set a personal worst the following year..oops)    So, where I am currently, I am more than glad to hear the sappy songs on the radio and belt them out (not in tune, mind you) with my car top down & really not give a rip if anyone makes fun of me for singing along with Peter Cetera -- or both the Lionel Richie AND Diana Ross parts to "Endless Love."  Tonight's Chicago flashback was good -- I'm totally happy with where I am in life right now.  I have no complaints whatsoever..I love my friends, family, job, cat, house, whatever else.. and my car only has a CD player and no tape deck, so I don't even have the *option* of popping in the Devo tape. So there.

      I've just gotten home from having had dinner at one of Sac's best ethnic dives, Rice Noodle on Arden Way, and seeing the movie "Dodgeball."    While sitting at dinner with my friends Katie & Phil, we were laughing at the things that are suddenly more relevant in our lives now that we're well into our 30's.  Katie recently turned 35, and Phil and I both turned 33 within the last couple months.  I was telling them that a poster I saw at Kaiser yesterday listed key things you're supposed to pay particular attention to when you're certain ages in life.  The few groups were broken down by 0-2 years, 3-10 years, 11-19, 20-34, then what they listed as "middle age" from 35-64.  35 is considered middle age?  Why is it that the age that used to seem so OLD is now where we are in life?  Reading the obituaries (which I do), seeing people die in their 60's & 70's just seems so YOUNG now.  Unbelievable. My own father was almost 62 (and would have been 75 this year), and my mom is almost 68.  That just doesn't seem old at all anymore.   I still feel like I'm about 24, and I've gotten carded as recently as 2 weekends ago (3 times in one weekend, in fact, thanks to some good genes, sunscreen, a relatively healthy lifestyle, and Obagi products.)  Sometimes I have to remind myself that I've been out of college for 12 years, have owned my home for 7 years, have a responsible career, a diversified portfolio, actually care what the Fed is doing, what's covered under my HMO, and have lengthy conversations with friends about stuff that seems so very grown-up (of course, we do throw in the Sixteen Candles and Old School references whenever germane to the conversation at hand.)    What really threw me for a loop today, however, was running into my friend Heather M. whom I've known since 6th grade when she moved from Lincoln to Auburn.  I swear this girl has not changed a bit since 1981 -- I even marveled that her handwriting looked just the same when she was writing down her contact info for me.    She told me that she just thought of me a couple weeks ago when some neighbor kids got a tetherball pole, and one girl was totally kicking everybody's butts.  Now, back in my day, I used to play quite a bit of tetherball -- so much so that my main Christmas gift in 1981 was a tetherball set for the backyard.  (By the way, it wasn't a surprise because my brother told me what I was getting.  In return, I told him that he was getting one of those really sweet puffy jackets with the sleeves that zipped out so it became a vest.)    Heather told me that when she was new to Alta Vista, she found out quickly that nobody else wanted to play me in tetherball because I always won & pretty much ruled the playground.  I had no idea that I was so apt at the game, I just knew that I liked it & liked to win.    Even with my competitive streak (which hasn't really mellowed in the last 23 years, it just manifests itself differently) and the fact that my mom sewed all my clothes & all the other kids made fun of me -- compounded with the fact that I'd skipped a grade and was younger, smaller, and less socially graceful than the other kids, Heather and I became quick friends.  We remained thick as thieves over the years -- even when I had my headgear, paper route, was in the band, and everyone could see my blue turtle underwear through my yellow pants at the first dance in junior high -- she was still my friend.    Sadly, I said some stupid stuff towards the end of our junior year of high school, and we spent most of the time during our senior year not talking to each other.  We did reconcile prior to graduation and kind of stayed in touch for the next few years, but it was never quite the same.  We both blossomed in college, and thankfully my outwardly geeky side managed to slip away (mind you, I do Tivo Jeopardy!)  One of my best memories is a more recent one when she took a trip with me down to Berkeley the fall after I graduated in '92.  We went out with some of my sorority sisters who were still in school, and we hit a couple watering holes.  I asked if she wanted a beer, and she did, so I did what we did when I was in school and got us each our own pitcher.  She couldn't believe that we each had a pitcher, and then she looked around and saw that it was the norm, and then she seemed OK with it.  That is, until the beer started to fly.  I somehow got caught in the middle of what was soon to be a mock-brawl..two drunk frat guys who were playing around and one of them decided to throw his own pitcher of PBR on the other guy -- not realizing that I was in the middle.  Most of it landed on me, but having had this kind of thing happen before at the Come Back Inn (or Manny's, or Larry Blake's, or The Axe..formerly known as Mellange, or the Bear's Lair, or any given fraternity party), I just brushed it off..not a big deal.  Usually it was a stray Alcatel cup that was hurled and not a full pitcher, but hey, that's why you wear stuff out that you don't care much about.   I'd never seen her laugh so hard in all the years we'd been friends.  That was probably one of the last times we'd spent any amount of quality time together, but I did think about her a lot over the years.  We ran into each other once back in '98, but that was the last contact we'd had until tonight.  To me, there are no coincidences.  People and events happen in your life in certain times of your life for a reason.  Sometimes people float in and out at seemingly random times, but there is always a reason why you are being faced with that person/situation at that very given moment.  Maybe for me, running into Heather this week was my reminder that we can set past troubles aside, share a laugh with a treasured friend, and remember what times were like when we didn't have to worry about mortgages, taxes, wrinkles, HMOs, or whatever else ails us in our 30's and just remember what it was like to kick some popular-girl-butt in an honest game of tetherball.

      One of the questions I hear most frequently from my non-running-club friends is "Why do you run that much?"  Much like the whole dog-ball-licking thing, it's "because I can."  What started out innocently enough in high school so I could earn a varsity letter so I could get the cute jacket -- then later in college as a way to blow off steam during the time my father passed away and I was faced with graduating with that oh-so-useful English degree during the bad economy in 1992 -- has become a way of life.  Running is like brushing my teeth -- meaning, I feel gross if I don't do it.  Some days it's a challenge just to motivate myself to do my 'minumum' 3 mile loop in my neighborhood, and other times it seems comparatively easy to do a 50K trail run.  After this year's American River 50-Mile Endurance Run in April, I felt so great that I could have kept going.   I've seen running shirts that read, "cheaper than therapy" and I'd have to agree. Although, throwing down $100+ every few months for a new pair of shoes and having enough 'technical fabric' shorts, bras, tops, and socks to last a couple weeks is not cheap.    It's the time of the day that belongs only to me -- when I'm not responding to e-mails or phone calls, or being called into meetings or asked to pitch in just a little more for one of my volunteer endeavors.  I can switch off the voices in my head and listen only to the sound of my feet and the beat of my heart.  There's no better feeling in the world than that moment nearing dusk, when the sun hits the trees just right and creating shades found only in nature, the feel of the crisp air over my body as I run, then kicking it a little harder to pass up some schmo and leave him in my dust.

      Even though I only watched the first season of American Idol, like many others, I became fascinated with the instant celebrity of AI-3 hopeful William Hung.   When I first saw his audition on a clip of VH1's Best Week Ever (also known as the 'best show ever' in my book), I could almost hear my friend Julie's voice saying, "Ohhh..bless his heart!" because you could tell that he was just giving it his all, and it was painful to see the first time (the empathy and vicarious embarrassment ended once I realized how much he's able to cash in on this.)   I caught the 'making of the video' type show on Fuse for his "She Bangs" video, and I have never been so enraptured by 30 minutes of TV -- what amazed me most were the throngs of fans who have dedicated websites to him and just how much he's extending his fabled 15 minutes. My California Monthly (alumni magazine for UC Berkeley) even featured a full-page article on Mr. Hung -- this was truly a breath of pop culture air in an otherwise more cerebral publication.   So, naturally, when the opportunity arose to witness the auditions for William Hung backup dancers for 100.5 The Zone's "Day in the Zone" concert in Sacramento, my friend Katie and I were there. The auditions were held at Faces in midtown -- one of Sacramento's more renowned gay nightclubs. Being the straight girl, I'd only been there once before for the last stop of a bachelorette party more than 7 years ago. Katie had been there more recently. Ironically, it was the bar of choice following a game for her coed softball team, and she didn't think anything of it until she was very popular in her softball outfit.   However, both Katie and I have been exposed to a wide variety of folk in our lifetimes, so we were both cool hanging out &amp; being in the overwhelming minority. We enjoyed the Diva Show, consisting of drag queens lip syncing to various songs -- one guy was totally Selena..not just JLo as Selena, but the real deal. I actually tipped one large "sista" $1 who was giving 110% as Mary J. Blige (she was *definitely* not Li'l Kim.)   Then, it was time to start the auditions. Katie and I were toying with the idea of trying out, but neither of us was ready to commit. (We were more than qualified, having unknowingly shown off our dance skills on the big screen at The Zone's New Year's Eve festivities at the Sheraton. We learned of our fame later when Julie told us that her "date" for the evening looked up at the big screen and asked, "Aren't those your friends?" when he saw the bodacious brunettes flipping their feather boas to the unrivaled beats of Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean.")   When I saw that those who were trying out were quite serious about their craft and were all accomplished dancers, I knew I had to "Hung it up" a bit and signed up. I was called on stage and did my best dorky white girl dance moves, including a couple of the William Hung "She Bangs" arm waves, and my audition was through. I am elated, yet humbled, to say that my performance was a real crowd-pleaser, and I'm glad I did it.   Sadly, I was not selected as one of the backup dancers. But, in the words of the immortal William Hung, "I already did my best. I have no regrets."

      Don't listen to Joe Baltake, "The Village" is a great flick.  M. Night TooShyShyHushHushEyetoEye's latest endeavor takes us to a late 19th century settlement where the inhabitants have a truce with some creatures that live in the woods surrounding the town. I won't write too much else about the plot, as I'm afraid that I'll let it slip out that Bruce Willis is really dead the whole time.  Superb casting -- including the ever-brooding Joaquin (nee "Leaf") Phoenix and a breakout performance by Ron Howard's daughter who, thankfully, looks nothing like her Uncle Clint -- combined with strong character development, intriguing cinematography, and a slight ethereal tone to the overall landscape & coloration made this a captivating movie (even without the surprise ending.)  Just be forewarned that if you go to see this at the Holiday Cinema in Davis, they won't let you take your leftovers from dinner into the theater with you, but you can have them keep your food in the fridge for you.  (I guess they thought we'd start snackin' on some Kathmandu Kitchen's Tandoori Chicken during a particularly tense scene.)

      Who needs pharmaceuticals if you've got a pair of Brooks Addictions?&nbsp;   I'm at a critical juncture with a few different projects -- writing a new corporate brochure,&nbsp;populating our website with content, writing our next employee magazine & taking all the photos for it, and writing my business case to do an overhaul of our publication for our clients.&nbsp; A lot of the information overlaps, but it all has to be written in the style appropriate for whatever media it will ultimately be.  I'd taken some work home with me last night, as I had a burst of motivation at the end of the day but needed a change of scenery.&nbsp; Something must have happened somewhere along I-5, as I lost the creative juices between the W-X and&nbsp;I'm guessing around&nbsp;Seamas Ave.&nbsp; I got home around 7pm and logged on.&nbsp; Nothing was coming to me, so I decided to do my weights workout.&nbsp;   I logged back on around 8:30 and wrote some stuff that was definitely usable, but I wasn't loving it.&nbsp; I have a policy of not turning in a "final" product if I don't love it -- same thing goes for buying clothing/shoes/whatever else, I have to LOVE it (otherwise, what's the point?)  I placed phone calls to two very trusted fellow writing-types who would understand my plight and possibly give me a different take on what I was trying to say.&nbsp; Alas, nobody was home.   The adrenaline was starting to build, and I'd either be up all night or I'd have to double up on the Dromias to be able to turn the brain off and get some sleep.&nbsp;   Then, I did what came most naturally to me.&nbsp; I put my running shoes on, got geeked out in my reflector vest, grabbed my pepper spray & MagLite(TM) and ran my little 3 mile loop hard and fast.&nbsp; The adrenaline got turned off, and the endorphins pumped into my brain and freed up the writer's block.&nbsp; I had my epiphany about 3/4 mile away from home, and actually let out a verbal "ah ha!," thus scaring the crap out of the woman who was out walking her Sheltie.   Still gamey from the run, I cranked out some high quality text -- spending only about 20 minutes on it, but feeling extremely satisfied.&nbsp; Followed by a quick shower and some quality reading time, I was able to get to bed at a reasonable hour and get some quality sleep without even dreaming about work.&nbsp;

         I happened across this article when I was perusing the Stockton Record's website for work-related news.           &nbsp;     Check out how much this guy invented!&nbsp; I love Tang!           &nbsp;        &nbsp;    Inventor of Pop Rocks candy dies of heart failure at 92   By Scott Smith   Record Staff Writer   Published Wednesday, July 28, 2004     STOCKTON -- William A. Mitchell, the man who brought the world Pop Rocks, powdered alcohol and quick-setting Jell-O, died Monday in a Stockton care home.     &nbsp;   He was 92.     Mitchell died of congestive heart failure, said his daughter, Cheryl Mitchell.  Mitchell retired in 1976 from General Foods Corporation in Lincoln Park, New Jersey, where he was a chemist for 35 years. Mitchell moved to Stockton in 1999 after the death of his wife.     Even in his 90s Mitchell developed food products for Cheryl Mitchell's Stockton based company Creative Research Management.     "We sure enjoyed having him around," said Cheryl Mitchell.     Mitchell held over 70 patents, including inventions for Cool Whip, the flavoring for Tang Drink Mix. During a brief stint with the Eastman Kodak Company, he helped develop the chemical process for developing the color green, she said.     During World War II when tapioca supplies from the East were cut off, Mitchell developed a tapioca substitute for General Foods.     But Pop Rocks, which he patented in 1958, was Mitchell's claim to fame. Mitchell initially set out create an instant soft drink when he put some of the sugar flavoring infused with carbon dioxide into his mouth. A cultural phenomenon was born.     But Pop Rocks didn't hit the market until 1975, so only Mitchell's family and co-workers experienced the dazzling explosions on their tongue from the sugary candy.     "For about 30 years we enjoyed our own private stash of Pop Rocks," Cheryl Mitchell said.     Mitchell spent years fighting an urban myth that the carbonated candy was fatal if a person drank carbonated soda at the same time. Mitchell's inventions reflected his quirky sense of humor, Cheryl Mitchell said.     Mitchell is survived by seven children, all of whom hold advanced university degrees.     Charlie Mitchell, an aerospace engineer in Colorado, recalled his father taking all seven children on camping trips through Europe and the United States. William Mitchell's goal was to have each of his children visit each of the states by the time they attended college, Charlie Mitchell said.     "I think everybody made it," he said.     Eric Wegner, manager for Pop Rocks Candy, the New Jersey firm that handles online sales of the explosive candy, said he knows William Mitchell only as a name. But he dispelled the urban myth that Pop Rocks were deadly if eaten while drinking carbonated soda.     "It's a good story, but not true," Wegner said.      William Mitchell developed       * Pop Rocks  * Cool Whip  * Powdered alcohol  * The flavor in Tang  * Tapioca substitute  * Quick-setting Jell-O

      OK kids, be sure to check the EXACT time when you're sending someone a meeting request in Outlook.&nbsp;   This is a tool I use everyday, so it's not like I need to be extra cognizant to make sure I'm doing it correctly.  Yesterday I sent a meeting request to a coworker, and I couldn't figure out why it wasn't&nbsp; showing up on my calendar for Wednesday morning.&nbsp; After several minutes, I noticed that it had been scheduled for 9:30pm-10:30pm.  Imagine my horror when I realized that my (male) coworker received a meeting request from me which read:   Time: 9:30pm-10:30pm   Location: Your office   Message: This likely won't take a full hour, but I'd like to take some photos while I'm there too.   Needless to say, I sent an update in Outlook immediately, changing the time from p.m. to the more appropriate a.m.  &nbsp;

      Much more satisfying than knowing a correct response that even Ken Jennings doesn’t know is winning&nbsp;1st place at the Streets of London&nbsp;Pub Quiz.  The Day-Johnson-Sabin combination proved to be somewhat of a “Dream Team,” including former contestants of  Jeopardy!  and  Win Ben Stein’s Money .  Was it a fluke?&nbsp; We’ll only know when we return to defend our title.

      This morning I did something I've done before -- I fell down some of the stairs in my house.&nbsp; It's easy enough to do when I'm rushing around (as I was this morning) and wearing socks (not *just* socks, mind you) on the carpeted steps.   The last time this happened in '98 or so, I'd just finished cleaning out Princess Kitty's litter pan and the bag flew out of my hand when I fell.&nbsp; You can only imagine the mess THAT caused.  This time I thought I escaped unscathed; that is, until I tried to check my blind spot while driving to work this morning.&nbsp; It was then that I knew that some damage had been done.&nbsp; I went about my business as best I could this morning, sitting through two meetings and swiveling in my chair when I need to address someone at the other end of the table or to look at whoever was speaking.&nbsp; I felt like Dr. Evil in the swivel chair, but I could not turn my head to the left at all, and turning it to the right wasn't so easy either.&nbsp; My doc was able to get me in, and he gave me a prescription for enough drugs to kill a horse.&nbsp; I should be good to go in the next day or so, but I will be rather doped up on nsaids, muscle relaxants, and pain killers -- the street value of my bag of drugs could probably pay for&nbsp;my August mortgage bill.&nbsp; And, as I write this, I have a bag of frozen berries affixed to my neck.  As I was waiting&nbsp;for the&nbsp;pharmaceutical consultation, I was able&nbsp;to overhear the woman&nbsp;who was getting her consultation.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was picking up percocet for someone else.&nbsp; I know of&nbsp;percocet all too well, as that's one of the things my dad took when he had cancer.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;pretty potent, and&nbsp;it's the type&nbsp;of&nbsp;scrip that is filled out in triplicate so the gov't can keep extra tabs on who's dispensing it to whom and how frequently.&nbsp; The woman asked the pharmacist, "Well, is it OK&nbsp;if she drinks&nbsp;while taking this?"&nbsp; The pharmacist said, "It's probably not a good idea."&nbsp; The&nbsp;woman&nbsp;asked, "Not even a glass or two of wine?"&nbsp; The&nbsp;pharmacist said that it probably&nbsp;wasn't wise, but a little bit of wine wouldn't be too bad.&nbsp; The woman wanted to know the exact definition of "a little bit" and then proceeded to ask if it were OK to take with&nbsp;xanax (apparently this person has social anxiety that apparently the alcohol doesn't help&nbsp;much.)  So, now here I am with my laptop so I can work during the more lucid times & a variety of cheesy magazines for when the drugs kick in.&nbsp; (The true test will come at 7pm when I see how well I fare against Mormon Superstar Ken Jennings.)  And, if you don't believe me, just come on over and drop a briefcase on the floor when I least expect it a'la Mike Brady.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      It was 3pm and I was hungry.&nbsp; We had mediocre Chinese takeout during our brief staff meeting earlier, and I didn't eat too much of it.  &nbsp; There is always food to be had in our office building, as catered meetings seem to be the norm &amp; there are always leftovers.&nbsp; So, I went foraging in the 1st floor kitchen and happened across a birthday cake.&nbsp;&nbsp; I already knew about the cake, as it was for one of my fellow team members and I'd already had a small piece at lunchtime.&nbsp;  &nbsp; When I first saw it in our meeting, I was *planning* on a bigger piece because I got all excited when I saw that it was a grocery store cake, and those always have the best pure sugar buttercream frosting AND it had some big flowers on it (the best part.)&nbsp; Once I found out it was whipped cream frosting, I was less than enthused. &nbsp; Those who know me best know that I'm not impressed with the Freeport Bakery "fruit basket" cake.&nbsp; No way man, that whipped cream frosting is sick dog.&nbsp; Just give me the Costco / Safeway / wherever else regular white/yellow cake with the buttercream frosting and lots of flowers on it &amp; I'm a happy girl.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been to weddings in recent years where I'm right there at the cake table with the little kids, just angling for the piece with the most frosting.&nbsp; The cake cutters laugh when I ask for a piece with a flower, thinking that I'm kidding (when I'm clearly not.)&nbsp; Also, the basic grocery store carrot cake with cream cheese frosting also rocks -- I've had the same from Ettore's and was underwhelmed (nothing beats homemade for the carrot cake though.) &nbsp; ANYWAY, I went in to the first floor kitchen and saw what was left of the cake.&nbsp; There were a few large chunks, including a flower, part of the birthday greeting, and some other decorative touches that were done in buttercream ON TOP of the whipped cream crap.&nbsp; What's&nbsp;a girl to do?&nbsp; How about scouting out a plastic knife, then gently scraping off the flower, the "ay urie" (what was left of "Happy Birthday Laurie"), and the last bit of pink frosting from around the border, then touching up the cake with the remaining whipped cream frosting so nobody could tell? &nbsp; It worked for me, and it was TASTY. &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I've been noticing with increasing regularity that reporters and their editors are taking more "poetic license" with articles, headlines, and captions. &nbsp; Not that everyone must comply with the  AP Stylebook  or  Strunk &amp; White's Elements of Style , but I'm getting exponentially more irritated with the dumbing down of stories and/or laziness&nbsp;in reporting the news. &nbsp; Most recently, the  Sacramento Bee  ran a headline that "Junior" was hospitalized at UCD Med Center for 2nd degree burns.&nbsp; Not aware of any public figure with the last name of "Junior," my interest was piqued.&nbsp; The lead indicated that Dale Earnhardt, Jr. suffered burns at a recent crash in Sonoma and was being treated in Sacramento.&nbsp; The article continued to reference him as "Junior" although his last name is indeed "Earnhardt."&nbsp;  &nbsp; Similarly, when Robert Downey, Jr. was experiencing all of his legal woes ("Which time?" you ask), the media referred to him as "Junior."&nbsp;  &nbsp; Their last names are Earnhardt and Downey, not Junior.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Last week I read an online article from the  Auburn Journal  (which I used to deliver in junior high and high school), and while the Auburn region has grown significantly, the paper still maintains much of its small-town vibe.&nbsp; However, this is no excuse for a glaring mistake that should have been caught by a copy editor.&nbsp; The story referenced Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, but the writer repeatedly spelled his name as "Kozinski" in the article.&nbsp; I sent an e-mail to the reporter and the paper's editor pointing out that Kaczynski had *kind of* been a major news story in recent years, and it would have been simple to do some basic fact checking.&nbsp; Of course, I didn't hear anything back -- further engraining the name "Auburn Urinal" in my brain, which is what most locals called the paper when I was growing up. &nbsp; Nevertheless, I am a news junkie and read pretty much anything I can get my hands on.&nbsp; I've come to accept the notion that mistakes will happen, editors will slant stories, and bright-eyed fresh out of college reporters are likely more concerned with their "art" and learning how to survive on $13K per year.&nbsp; Similarly, as someone who writes for a living, I know that not everything of mine will be to everyone's taste.&nbsp; However, the basic journalistic tenet of&nbsp;accuracy should never be ignored or compromised.  &nbsp;

      Ever since I bought my S2000 in March, I’ve felt like I was part of a new family.&nbsp; Anytime I see another S2000 driver he – they’re always guys in their early 40’s to mid-50’s..guess I bought a midlife crisis car – invariably honks/waves/hollers something nice at me.&nbsp; Don’t let the car’s diminutive size fool you – the horsepower and torque in this car could easily make up for what a man may think he’s lacking elsewhere.&nbsp; It’s better than the Boxster but about $10K less, making it both compensatory and relatively economical.  &nbsp;  Here are isolated instances of the camaraderie I’ve experienced in the car – these are just a sampling of a much larger phenomenon:  &nbsp;  As I was cruising up 50 on my way to work a few weeks ago, I was in the far right lane, about 1 mile west of my exit.&nbsp; I spied a red S2K in the #1 lane, and the driver then cut over three lanes of traffic (very safely, mind you), just to cruise up next to me, hover next to me as we exchanged pleasantries, then he zoomed off and back over into the fast lane as I exited the freeway.  &nbsp;  Last Friday on my way home from work, a yellow S2K hovered near me as we did our secret salute to each other, then I zoomed off.&nbsp; No more than 3 miles later on the W-X freeway, I zipped past a poor guy in a silver S2K who was stuck in the northbound I-5 connector who simply gave me a thumbs-up as I drove by.  &nbsp;  Situations like these never happened when I had any of my Accords.&nbsp; When one of my guy friends was asking if he should get a new 4-Runner or the VW Touareg, I told him, “Get the Touareg – it’s fun to drive something that you don’t see everyday.”&nbsp; He didn’t seem to “get” the fun aspect of waving to other drivers of the same car, paying them homage for their exquisite taste.  &nbsp;  Imagine my horror this morning as I was zipping up I-5 and merging onto eastbound 50 when I saw a silver S2K coming up on my right.&nbsp; I slowed down a little to let him do the hover &amp; salute..I even turned down 102.5’s Flashback Friday when they were playing the perennially dope Doug E. Fresh &amp; the Get Fresh Crew..and..and..I took my hand off the stick to wave, raised my hand and did the nod..and…NOTHING..no wave, no holler, no thumbs up…NOTHING…no response!&nbsp; What the..??  &nbsp;  All I could think that perhaps he was borrowing the car from someone and did not know the proper protocol.&nbsp;

      Thanks to Tim Murphy for posting this on his blog (timmurphy.blogspot.com) so I could put it on mine as well. *********************** From Assemblyman John Campbell's Capitol Communication   4th of July  In each of the 4 years that I have been a member of the state Assembly, we have had many "celebrations" on the Assembly floor. These "celebrations" are orchestrated by the Democrats who control the House and often involve singing and dancing.   Every one of my 4 years have seen substantial celebrations of Cinco de Mayo (Commemorates the Mexican victory over the French at the Battle of Puebla ), St. Patrick's Day (for the patron Saint of Ireland) and Chinese New Year's Day, among others. But never once have we celebrated America's Independence Day, the 4th of July.   So, this year, Republican Assemblyman Jay LaSuer of San Diego arranged for Vietnam war hero Admiral Jeremiah Denton to come to California to be a part of a 4th of July ceremony. As you may know, Admiral Denton was a Navy pilot in Vietnam who was shot down and spent 8 years in a Vietnamese prison. In 1966 while in prison, he was interviewed by North Vietnamese television in Hanoi after torture to get him to "respond properly." During this interview, he blinked his eyes in Morse code to spell out the word "torture." He was asked about his support for the war in Vietnam to which he replied "I don't know what is happening now in Vietnam, because the only news sources I have are Vietnamese. But whatever the position of my government is, I believe in it, I support it, and I will support it as long as I live." Four of his 8 years in prison were spent in solitary confinement. He later wrote the book "When Hell was in Session" chronicling his experience in Vietnam. When he stepped off the plane after being released from prison in 1973, he said "We are honored to have had the opportunity to serve our country in difficult circumstances. We are profoundly grateful to our Commander-in-Chief for this day. God bless America." He was later elected to the U.S. Senate from his home state of Alabama, becoming the first retired Admiral ever elected to that body. I could go on and on about his accomplishments.   Suffice it to say, Jeremiah Denton is unquestionably an American hero. The Democratic leadership refused to allow him on the Assembly floor and there will be no 4th of July celebration. A memo from the Democratic speaker's office said "problems have arisen both with regards to the spirit, content and participation of various individuals with regard to the ceremony." Apparently, they said that he did not believe in the "separation of church and state" and they didn't like the policies he supported as a United States Senator and therefore they would not allow him to be on the Assembly floor or to speak.   Upon hearing about this, Governor Schwarzenegger offered his meeting room last Monday for a ceremony with Admiral Denton. The room was overflowing with people. Only one elected Democrat was in attendance. A number of veterans of the last 4 wars were present. Admiral Denton gave a very moving speech about the 4th of July and about the undeniable commitment of our founding fathers' to their faith in God. He talked about how the war on terrorism may be the most difficult war we have yet fought. And he went on to say that he fears that partisan attacks on our mission and our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan sound too familiar to what he experienced in Vietnam. Following his speech, The Governor came out to personally spend time with him. Then this American hero, whose debt from us all can never be repaid, flew home to Alabama. The Assembly did meet on that day. And we did have a ceremony that lasted nearly 20 minutes. That ceremony was to celebrate the career of a reporter from the LA Times on the occasion of his retirement. Democrats universally praised him as being "balanced." He was allowed to speak for about 10 minutes. Admiral Denton was no longer in the building.   Four years of Cinco De Mayo and not one recognition of the 4th of July. An LA Times reporter praised, and the very person whose sacrifice allows him to express his opinion is banned. It is perverse. It is wrong. And it is disrespectful to all the men and women in uniform who have stared death in the face and to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice for the American people. Admiral Jeremiah Denton is a hero not because he was politician, but like all the other men and women of the Armed Forces, because he defended the ideals set forth with America's independence.   Democrats are always railing about intolerance and discrimination. But yet in practice, it is they who engage in regular state-sanctioned discrimination and who are intolerant of the presentation of other views. Maybe they are worried that people will listen. I do not send you this to bash Democrats. I send you this to demonstrate the huge chasm that exists between registered, voting Democrats, and elected Democrat leadership. I hope those of you who are not Democrats, will send this to your friends who are. If you are a Democrat, don't be ashamed.   Be angry. Change your party and your leadership, or leave it. Fortunately, we do not need the approval of the Speaker of the Assembly to celebrate our nation's independence this Sunday. Nor do we need his permission to thank those who fought to give us and to maintain our freedoms. On this 4th of July, as the burgers cook and the fireworks fly, let us remember......and give thanks.   As a final offering, I give you a poem that Admiral Denton read to us this week, through eyes clouded with tears:  It is the soldier, not the reporter, Who has given us freedom of the press. It is the soldier, not the poet, Who has given us freedom of speech. It is the soldier, not the campus organizer, Who has given us the freedom to demonstrate. It is the soldier, Who salutes the flag, Who serves beneath the flag, And whose coffin is draped by the flag, Who allows the protester to burn the flag." Amen. God bless America.

      Below is an e-mail I sent to Katie on the afternoon of March 19, 2004.  This was following an evening out which was supposed to consist solely of seeing the play "Arranged Marriage" at STC, preceded by *a* drink at Brew it Up.  What actually happened was *a few* drinks at Brew it Up, then the play, then a cab ride to Riverside Clubhouse for more merriment (when we decided that we probably wouldn't be meeting "our type" of guys at Faces, our original post-play bar plan.) *****************************  Here's the run-down:  Midnight-ish: arrive home, peel off work clothes, put on what can best be described as "Easter Egg Chic" (lavendar tank top, lime green pajama pants, light blue striped socks) turn on TV, flip on recorded episode of The Apprentice  12:15: down a 1/4 bag of Pepperidge Farms goldfish (original cheddar) and 1/2 bag of pretzel goldfish, and a handful of the mini goldfish (parmesan)  (Albertson's had goldfish 3 for $5 last week & they're a staple for my long runs)   12:30: decide that going to sleep would be a good thing, brush teeth, make a feeble attempt to wash face & slather on multiple skin products  1am: fall asleep  6am: wide awake, can't sleep, go into the bathroom & am surprised to see yesterday's blue jacket resting on the back of the toilet & am not surprised to see newly purchased BeneFit 'bad gal' mascara' 2 inches lower on my face than it was last night   6am-8am: Down a B complex vitamin, a ton of water, a Diet Squirt, and a yogurt; attempt to look human -- using all the hot water in the process, putting on more makeup than the law should allow  8:05: arrive at work  8:10: eat a toasted bagel slathered with cream cheese, chased by a 'welfare mocha' (free office decaf mixed with 1 packet of instant cocoa, 2 equals, and a heap of non-dairy creamer), chased by a Diet Squirt  8:15: down a club soda  8:20: down a ginger ale  10am: shudder & get somewhat nauseous when confronted with the California Beer Producers ad on the www.rtumble.com political news site  11am: down a Diet Squirt (before I left home, I grabbed about 6 sodas out of my fridge)  11:15: hunger strikes, must forage, think about food items that do not remotely smell like beer  11:30: attempt to go to Jack's, no parking immediately available, parking in front of Chipotle=Chipotle it is because it's  a short walk, order carnitas burrito bol + guac + bag of chips, get annoyed by hoochie-mama teenagers who are a dime short on their order, give them a dime, pay my way,  11:45am: Crank some G-n-R's "Paradise City" while cruising up American River Drive, think about that guy Ian we met last night who also works on ARD & laugh to myself that I told him I could beat him in a free throw or 3-point contest  Noon: Food is gone, as are two more sodas  UGH.

      Here are things you must read, buy, eat, or watch:   - READ David Sedaris’ books of essays: Start off with “Me Talk Pretty One Day” to get warmed up to his acerbic wit, then move onto “Holidays on Ice,” then read his latest “Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,” then move on to his earlier works of “Naked” and “Barrel Fever.”   - BUY a whole house fan: Spend about $1K and have a cool house where you will rarely need to use the air conditioning & keep fresh air circulating.   - EAT at some of Sacto’s best hole in the wall ethnic dives: Rice Noodles (Vietnamese on Arden between Fulton &amp; Morse), Safari (Kenyan on Fulton between Hurley & Sierra), Caballo Blanco (Mexican with the best flour tortilla chips ever, on Stockton at Franklin), Eljin’s Toucha Class Soul Food &amp; BBQ (on Stockton between Broadway &amp; Fruitridge)   - WATCH VH1’s “Best Week Ever,” HBO’s “Six Feet Under,” “Elimidate” (in syndication), and Comedy Central’s “Daily Show with Jon Stewart” and “Reno 911”   - BUY some sort of digital recording system. I have the Dish Network DVR, and it’s similar to Tivo. If you’re already a Dish subscriber, it’s only $5 more per month, and your life will never be the same.   - READ any of the work by SI “last page” writer, Rick Reilly. I’d start off with “Life of Reilly” then move onto “Who’s your caddy” and finish up with his fictional piece, “Missing Links.”   - BUY anything from Lucy, the ultimate provider in casual/workout gear for women. It’s the perfect place to pick up the type of outfit you’d wear to a casual dinner/brunch date and make it seem like you’re THAT fabulous without even trying. The local store is at Pavilions, between Piatti and Sharper Image.   - EAT Nutella…lots of it. It’s great on toasted Great Harvest honey wheat bread or on graham crackers. We did a blind taste test comparing Nutella with the Milky Way equivalent on Memorial Day of 2000. Not only does the Nutella taste better and have a better consistency, it is also about $2 less per jar. And yes, Kobe did lose his Nutella endorsement deal after his Colorado scandal broke loose.   - WATCH some old Hitchcock classics to see how movies used to be made! I guarantee you’ll just about as creeped out by “Vertigo” as you are with the likes of “The Others” or “The Ring.”

      Within the past 90 hours, I've been to two ceremonies that have each featured the bagpipes and "Ave Maria." One was a wedding, and the other was a funeral.  On Saturday, we watched as our friends Scott and Leslie begin their new life together. The ceremony began and ended with a kilted piper. The exposed rafters of the church had "Ave Maria" painted ornately on them.  Today, I sat with some Junior League friends as one of our own said goodbye to her exceedingly talented, intelligent, and cherished 26-year-old son Andrew. The ceremony began and ended with a kilted piper. A tenor sang "Ave Maria" as the post-communion hymn.  Having been raised (baptized and confirmed) an Episcopalian, I'm more than familiar with Catholicism, as the Episcopal faith is like "Catholic Lite" -- with roughly the same amount of standing, sitting, kneeling, and other rituals (only without all the guilt.) And, similar to how it was growing up at St. Luke's Episcopal in Auburn, my mind wandered quite a bit during much of the Eucharist portion of the service today at Sacred Heart in East Sac.  I saw Andrew's mom, Cheryll, and knew that she'd never wear that same dress again and not think, "This is what I wore to his funeral." I still have two dresses hanging in my closet -- one that I wore to my dad's memorial service and the other to his burial at the Presidio in '92. Even though I've had them both for more than a decade, they're classics and I still wear them once in a while; however, as nice as they look, I've never felt the same in them. Yet, I refuse to relegate them to the closet of stuff I don't wear much anymore, nor could ever imagine putting them in my donation bag for the WEAVE Works project.  Also, while I knew how important it was for me to be there today to support Cheryll and her family, I knew that all of us in the congregation were likely a blur. I honestly cannot tell you who was at my father's service. It's only when I look through the guest book that I realize how many people were there. The church was absolutely packed for Andrew's service today, and it's obvious that he was very loved and respected by a wide variety of people.  At one point during the service I turned to my friend Debbie and told her "I wrote a paper on that poem in college," referring to A.E. Housman's work "To an Athlete Dying Young" that was read after eulogies. Debbie said, "I did too." It broke what was a tense moment -- both of us trying to be stoic, but quickly succumbing to the emotion that one feels as empathy to someone else who is absolutely falling apart with grief (in this case, the girl who read the poem.)  So, after the service, I headed back to my office and resumed my life as I know it -- only with the thought of how much a person's life can change depending on what happens between the opening and closing songs of the bagpipe and "Ave Maria."

      Something to go along with the 1 gallon jar of marinated artichoke hearts, 2 lb box of frozen taquitos, and the 128-pack of Tampax:   urlLink Costco begins test marketing caskets    DON BABWIN, Associated Press WriterMonday, August 16, 2004 (08-16) 16:20 PDT CHICAGO (AP) --  Whether you're in the market for a good night's sleep or the eternal kind, there's now a discount store somewhere that has you covered.  On Monday, Costco Wholesale Corp., better known for bulk chicken and cases of soda, started test marketing caskets along side mattresses in two of its Chicago-area stores.  "This is certainly something that can be an easy value," said Gina Bianche, a buyer in Costco's corporate office in Issaquah, Wash. "I don't want to say cheap value, but it just needs to be done."  Each of the six models from the Universal Casket Co., in colors including lilac and Neapolitan blue, is priced at $799.99, made of 18-gauge steel, considered medium weight for caskets, and can be delivered within 48 hours.  Caskets could already be purchased directly from manufacturers, in funeral supply stores and over the Internet, but big general merchandise stores had stayed away from selling caskets until now, said David Walkinshaw, a spokesman for the National Funeral Directors Association. At a Costco on Chicago's north side, shoppers checking out the new casket kiosk Monday seemed to like the idea that the same store where they buy so many things for this life was branching into the after life.  "A casket at Costco, yeah, I think it's pretty bizarre," said Inga Barth, 53. She wondered about buying a casket with only a kiosk and small samples of the caskets' material to look over, though, saying, "When you go casket shopping, you want to see the whole thing."  That didn't trouble John Neuhaus.  "I want the adjustable bed and mattress for my neck," he joked, pointing to one of the features highlighted at the kiosk. After all, he said, "It says eternal rest."  Others liked the idea of being able to shop for the casket long before a loved one's death, a time when the survivors are distressed, under time constraints and may feel they are at the mercy of funeral homes.  "I remember my mom was supposed to get a plain pine box for my dad and she walked out with mahogany," said Gretchen Henninger.  When her mother later died and Henninger was left to deal with the funeral arrangements, "I felt I was being manipulated into feeling some emotion that would lead me to spend more money," she said. "Taking that away would be wonderful."  Those involved in arranging funerals were not as enthusiastic about discount retailers moving in on their business.  "If you take the casket out of the equation and the casket is purchased in a retail environment, then that portion of the funeral director's profit center will disappear and the funeral director must respond to that," said George Lemke, executive director of the Casket and Funeral Supply Association.  Asked if that meant raising prices, he replied: "That's entirely possible."  Costco is prepared for that, said Fred Elsner, general manager of the north side store. When casket buyers dial the phone number on the brochure, "We will put them in touch with funeral homes that are part of the program," he said.  The brochure says buyers can cut their overall funeral costs by more than 30 percent that way. But Lemke said the funeral home working with Costco might not be the ones the family planned to deal with.  "If you are talking about going to a funeral home, 30, 40, 50 miles away, they (customers) might have an entirely different attitude," he said.  While caskets can costs several thousand dollars, some funeral homes do sell them for even less than Costco is charging, he said.  Walkinshaw, who also works as a funeral director in the Boston area, said he has caskets ranging from $350 to about $8,000. He doesn't thinks Costco will cut into the business of funeral homes.  "Other people have tried (selling caskets) and found out the public is real comfortable buying caskets from funeral directors," he said. "It's kind of one-stop shopping." Bonnie Busch, vice president in Costco's Midwest division, hopes shoppers will make one more stop. "I hope they don't have any deaths in the family, but if they do I hope we can help people out," she said.

      I'm not ashamed to admit that I enjoyed "Malibu's Most Wanted."  It's been playing on HomeBO recently, so I decided to invest the 80 minutes in it last night.  As a girl who's been called "LA Face with the Oakland Booty" by a couple guy friends and someone who has pumped 2Pac in her g-ride as recently as this morning, I was more than pleased with the overall premise of the movie.  And, with Taye Diggs AND Blair Underwood in one movie?  Bitch, please. .that is off the hook.  While I don't display the same pseudo-ethnic affectations as B-Rad in the movie, I have an appreciation for the culture that is diametrically opposed to my all-American, Cleaver-esque upbringing.  Does it have rhymes and a good beat?  Bring it.  Smothered steaks, collard greens, black eyed peas with hamhocks, cornbread, and finished off with some sweet potato pie?  Hell yes.  Imagine my elation when I learned that a fellow Junior League board member also enjoys the stylings of Dre, Snoop, Eminem, 50 Cent, and a barrage of others.  She's just as AnnTaylored out as I am for work, but that doesn't mean that we have to subject ourselves to Michael Bolton, Wilson Phillips, or other crappy music that fits the image more of the upwardly mobile, educated, career & civically minded, financial portfolio diversified, responsible homeowner 30-something females.  One of the absolute best parts of the movie (sorry, I can't call it a "film" -- while I liked it, it doesn't fit into the "film" category, such as Cinema Paradiso, Vertigo, et al) was Snoop's cameo as the voice of Ronnie Rizat.  I had to rewind that and watch it no fewer than eight times.  I chortled and nearly had Diet Squirt come out of my nose when I saw the "RR" bling around the rat's neck.  So if you're flipping around the channels and see that MMW is coming on soon, take the 80 minutes, throw back some ribs, and enjoy.

      My home phone rang this morning just as I was on my way out the door. The Caller ID showed "Privacy Manager" -- meaning that it was a blocked number but someone who wanted to reach me. I answered the phone, and the recorded message said it was "Paul from Chase Manhattan security" calling. Paul was obviously from Brooklyn, Hoboken, or some other near-NYC locale, as he pronounced his name with two syllables as "Puhawl" like "Puhawl from the Diamond Center."  It sounded important, so I accepted the call.  He let me know that "unusual" charges had been made on my Mastercard account, noting that I have a pattern of using my account at Shell gas and Amazon.com, but no major purchases.  Well, apparently someone used my account to charge $6,170.20 for some online ancestry search site. Hello! Since my brother did such a bang-up job on his family history project in junior high in 1981-1982, such hefty fees for researching our family is not necessary.  So, I will be sent a new card with a new account number in a few weeks in addition to some legal paperwork to sign, and I will not be held responsible for any illegal charges..priceless!

      Just throw some Emerson at them next time they say your entries are too long:  "Whoso must be a man must be a non-conformist."  "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."  "To be great is to be misunderstood."  Or, you could quote Wayne's World: "Was it Kierkegaard or Dick Van Patten who said, 'If you label me, you negate me'?"  And I'll leave you with this thought, "If you need me, just call.  You know how to dial, don't you? You just put your finger into the hole and make tiny little circles."

      Rick James died of "natural causes" today -- I don't think the years of crack smoking had anything to do with his untimely demise (not unlike Fred "ReRun" Berry's obesity leading to his deathly "natural causes" collapse last October.)  This made me flash back to the summer of 1990 when I went into my local Tower Records and asked if they knew "that really cool song that samples Rick James 'SuperFreak.'" Yes, my friends, that would be MC Hammer's "U Can't Touch This."  I always thought the line "She likes the boys in the band" was funny, as I pictured this "girl you don't take home to muthaaah" as having a penchant for some dweeb from the marching band. She's getting all freaky on him in his Q-tip hat, wool/poly blend uniform with gold military-looking piping, and his xylophone.  Points of clarification from this morning's post:  Yes, I did go back to sleep for a while -- from 6am-7:15am  No, I'm not upset with any person when I referenced the "personal" stuff -- I just have a lot going on with JLS &amp; Chips stuff right now.

      Like many other "recovering perfectionists," I often have a problem with turning off my brain at night.  This issue is usually solved with a good workout, so I thought I'd be OK last night as I did my first hill workout in several months. (Nevermind the fact that some hoodlum stole my water bottle -- complete with the adjustable handle with the zippered pocket for my Gu and other small items -- as I made my way either up or down the Fair Oaks Bridge Street hill for the last time, as it was where I'd left it the penultimate time.)  However, I made the mistake of checking my work e-mail just before I was getting ready for bed.  I had one REALLY good message from a higher-up, which I promptly forwarded to my boss, and I had one not-as-good one from another higher up that simply stated that we need to revisit one of the projects we're working on -- not a big deal, it was just something I thought I'd crossed off the list.  As luck would have it, I fell asleep at a reasonable hour and was even able to go back to sleep after I got a wrong number call just as I was getting deeply into my REM cycle.  Alas, dreamland came to a screeching halt and insomnia reared its ugly head around 3am.  This hasn't happened in quite some time, so it was more than disarming when I had the realization that I was finished sleeping for the night.   Once in a while, something fires up in my brain when I'm asleep that jolts me awake and gives me a startling revelation -- albeit good or bad.  I had mixed feelings this time around, and I felt like I needed clarification on various issues from different people -- both professionally and personally.  Since 3am isn't the best time to be calling someone to ask questions, I did the next best thing and started busying myself with other tasks.  Mind you, my coworkers are accustomed to receiving e-mails from me either way after (or way before) "regular" working hours -- the best part is that I work with a lot of people so similar to me that it's not rare to get an immediate response back from 5am e-mails.  I don't leave voicemails in the middle of the night, as many people have their voicemail set up to make their cell phone or pager beep when they have a new message on the work system.  So, I'm pleased to report that the laundry is done, both bathrooms are clean, the recycling has been taken out for the week, and the cat box is sparkling.  Moreover, I had a flash of inspiration and cranked out a significant portion of a brochure.  Do you know what's going to happen now?  I'm going to be wide awake for another hour or so, then I'll start to get VERY sleepy around the time I'd usually be getting up.  Insomnia stinks.  Happy Friday!

      Sometimes we get those not so subtle reminders that we are human and that life is fragile.  I learned last Friday that one of our summer interns was killed in a single-car accident that morning on his way back to college in Colorado. I felt horrible for his family and friends. Quite a few people here at work were pretty shaken up. He'd worked at one of our plants as an engineering intern, so I didn't think that our paths had crossed.  It was just yesterday afternoon that I realized that I did in fact know him and had talked to him a couple times -- I just hadn't put the name/person together. I even have a photo of him in my last company magazine from when he went on the bus tour of our company's various operations. I saw him the day before he passed when he came in to say goodbye to some people and pick up his last check.  He was 21 and was on a full football scholarship at the top school in the nation for his major. What really puts a rock in my gut is that his friend -- who was also out in Sacramento for the summer -- was driving in the car behind him and likely saw the whole event unfold.  Then, not too much later, I was browsing the message boards on classmates.com and saw a posting that I'd somehow missed in the last two years -- the fact that a guy, Jay, who grew up in my neighborhood and whom I'd known since junior high died of a heart attack two years ago.  I distinctly remember sitting in the back of Mr. Krizman's English class with him in 1985 during our freshman year at Placer. Our class was right after lunch, and we chatted a lot -- so much so that we got in trouble a couple times. One day he passed me a leaf from outside. On the leaf he'd written, "You are nice." I kind of laughed and tossed it back to him. I still thought about that a lot over the years about what a sweet, gentle gesture he'd done and how it had completely made my day at the time. I'm sure that Jay's up in heaven passing all kinds of leaves to people now.

      By 10am I was already sporting my 3rd new pair of nylons for the day.   Hosiery is the bane of my existence.

      Last night we returned to Streets of London to defend our Pub Quiz champion title from the week before, and we partook in the two free dinner entrees and the two free pitchers of beer that we won as our prize.   While nothing compares with the glory of 1st place, we may have been more satisfied with the CD/DVD 2nd & 3rd place prizes.  I’d eaten at Streets before, but had never strayed far from the Shrimp Windsor salad – an innocuous mix of vegetables and shrimp.  I was feeling a bit sassier last night and opted for the Chicken Caesar (traditional British fare, I’ve been told.)  It seemed harmless enough when it arrived; although, I didn’t see any chicken on it.  I assumed that it was below some of the slightly yellowish lettuce.  I took a forkful of extremely garlic-dressing-laden lettuce, some parmesan cheese, and what appeared to be a medium-large pumpernickel crouton.  The crouton had an interesting texture – it seemed more fried on the outside and had a very dry, mealy inside with something very chewy and dry in the very center.  It was very different than the crisp sourdough crouton, so I cut one apart and realized that this was (supposedly) the “chicken” in my salad.  I then proceeded to separate the croutons and “chicken” from the lettuce – which I continued to eat.  Greg spied the various piles on my plate, and I informed him that that was indeed chicken.  I told him that if he didn’t believe me, he could try some for himself.  He did.  He was just as intrigued and disgusted at the same time as I had been.  He hadn’t fared too much better with his Bangers & Mash, stating that the sausages were more breakfast-y type &amp; his potatoes apparently had had eyes in them before they were mashed, as there were several chunks that could be picked up by their stringy membranes – very dingleberry-like, indeed.  "At least they're continuing the British tradition of bad food," he stated.  As the rest of our team showed up, we showed them the chicken and dared them to try it.  They did.  It was not unlike my brother’s towels from water polo that he’d let “ripen” in the trunk of his car, then force me to smell them after a couple weeks.  The problem turned out to be that I hadn’t eaten much in the past couple days.  We had a great dinner on Friday night that kept me pretty full for most of Saturday – I’d subsisted on a Jamba Juice and some chocolate-covered raisins on Saturday.  I did a tough workout at the gym in the evening, then got up and ran 13 miles on Sunday morning, then went straight home and crashed out.  I’d had ½ an enchilada, 2 small pieces of sushi, and a little bit of salad mid-day, but that was it until our Streets dinner. Thankfully, Rick’s Dessert Diner was open late last night, so we stopped in there for some much-needed sustenance.  So, tonight, I’m meeting up with Ellen for dinner – a fellow foodie, so I know we’ll go somewhere good..probably not Streets.  Incidentally, the readers of Sacramento Magazine named Streets of London as the 3rd best Irish Pub.  Think about that as you’re digesting your meal from the #1 seafood place, Red Lobster.
