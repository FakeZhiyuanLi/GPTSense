       You know when someone have made a confession to you, feelings, love, and all for you, you're suppose be flattered, right? Right...... but this, I don't know, "confession", was simply kinda dissapointing and kinda sad to me.. I don't know why.. Maybe because...... it was too much for me take? Hmmm.. Nahhh, couldn't be it.. Could it be...... she took a very long time to tell me this now? After 4 damn years? After what I've been thru'? After what she've been thru'? Or is it because she took her own sweet lil' ass time to tell me this because she doens't wanna so called interrupt my chase for her bestfriend or what-so-ever? Now that's bullshit.. Sigh.. Just fcuk it.. Not coming school to school anymore.. Got no fcuking mood to do that..  Life's a bitch. Where's the puppies?

      Went to out to study with Wan again.. Not sure if I really did study.. I was like doing my homework the whole day infront of her.. I did my geography homework, and then I did my art coursework.. My round ass was flattened, I guess.. Studied at McDonald's from 12.30pm to 7pm.. Saw Cai Yu.. She didn't say hi.. The Special stream girl was studying alone there.. I still couldn't forget the day I went to ask for her number.. "Heyyy, c-c-can I have y-y-your number?" Haha!! Embarrased my stupid ass that time.. Aiya.. Can't be bothered.. Better off spending some fun time with Wan.. Haha.. Played the stupid soccer game on the paper.. Took some pictures.. Then we ate dinner at S-11.. There..  I'm not mad at you.. Just disappointed 'cause we could have been together.. We could have..

      Watched 'The Village' with my sis just now.. She was as bored as I was.. Met her at Junction 8 at 5.30pm.. Booked the tickets and then went to eat at Pastamania.. It was my first time eating there.. Bought a pasta, a pizza and a soup.. Then before going into the cinema, we went to take some NEO prints.. Is that right? Haha.. It was very expensive.. Every machine was like $9-$8.. So it's not worth it for those people who are not that photogenic, I guess.. Then it was movie time.. A job very well done to Mr. Night Shyamalan, director of this movie.. The storyline is good.. Gotta pay attention to the movie 'cause you have to understand it.. The ending was quite rather unpredictable and funny too cause the twist is very twisty.. You'll get what I mean.. I gave 4 out of a total 5 stars.. Firsty, I thought that I've wasted my sister's money on the movie but in the end, I think I've benifited by getting some creative ideas for my essay writings.. You guys gotta see it! Then tell me what you think.. 'The Sisters', you guys are next! Today's whacked I tell you! Came home from the cinema, The City of Angels were on Channel 5.. Then, The Truman Show is on right now as I'm posting.. Super Sundayyy!! Haha..   I would rather have one breath of her hair, one kiss of her mouth, one touch of her hand than having an eternity without it.. One!   Nicholas Cage as Seth Plate in The City of Angels

      I've got nothing to do.. It's a Sunday and I've got nothing to dooo.. Sooo damn bored.. Now eating the new instant campbell soup for lunch.. I know it says there on the packet, 'Good for breakfast!', but what the hell.. Just chap siao.. Pour powder, add 200ml of hot water and stirrr.. Oh ya! Shaheela was suprisingly online just now.. I was playing my playstation when I saw a blinking taskbar button below with the corner of my eye..  It's been awhile since we last chatted.. Heh.. She've cut her hair.. Looks good though.. Shaheela.. Met her through Mirc.. Yet to meet each other someday.. Ahhh.. Anyways, all this 3 quotes is for you Chief.. Take care guys!   You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.   Albert Camus      Life is like a coin. You can spend it any way you wish, but you only spend it once.   Lillian Dickson      Be glad of life because it gives you the chance to love and to work and to play and to look up at the stars.

      Argh.. Cindy's dog is sooo noisy!! Bark here,  bark there, everywhere bark bark.. Oh Mac Donald had a......  (Let's not get carried away!) So ya.. Cindy's house is just under mine.. Why get a dog? I mean, the poor dog will always get scolded if it makes some noise.. Always get scolded.. KAO PEH AH!! Sigh.. Can hear right from my room! Advice? Decrease the noise pollution by getting a frog or a sea monkey for a pet.. This will truly surely make Captain Planet very happy! Yup!  Captain Planet.. He's the hero.. Gonna......

      Skarang kat rumah.. Tengah ponteng skolah nie.. Malas lah nak pegi.. Dah lah kaki sakit.. Sigh.. Was at the street soccer court yesterday.. Wanted to rembat the ball lah.. Then got this idiot just tapped it away and instead of rembat-ing the ball, I rembat-ed nothing but the idiot's foot.. Bruised...... So I'll add this to my 'Injured Parts of The Legs' list: Bruised upper right thigh, strained lower right thigh, sprained left ankle and the latest, bruised right foot.. God, this sucks..
