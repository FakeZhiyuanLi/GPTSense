      I managed to get a gmail account from some nice people at gmailswap.com.  They set up a new site  urlLink here  to help people get accounts for free and stop the greedy selling on eBay.  I'll try to give a few away there once I get some invites.  Special shoutout to gmailfairy for the account!

      I've spent the past few days searching for a gmail account.  I've tried eBay, but who wants to pay $50+ for email, no matter how kickass it may seem?  Then I tried gmailswap.com, but I haven't seen anyone there give any invites for anything other than money.  Even the site owner is using the site to sell his invites, for more than they go for on eBay.  I even got ripped off once, which is pretty sad considering the item I "swapped" was worth 99 cents (an iTunes song).  There are some sad, sad people in this world.  Today I was going to try Orkut, a community service from Google, which is supposed to have a community of people sending invites, but then I found that's only 18+ years old.  Sure, I lie about my age plenty online, but I don't when signing up for anything where I'd be interacting with others.  I know from experience that it's VERY difficult to keep an age bluff up in any online community .  But I digress.  So now I'm trying Blogger.  Hopefully I can become an "active" member and get myself an account before it becomes public.  More random ramblings later, time to watch the important last quarter of the TWO HOUR American Idol finale.

      Ah, Monday.  The worst day of the week.  This Monday wasn't too bad because I basically did nothing the first three hours of school.  You see, HSAs (High School Assesments) are all this week.  They're huge, insanely easy, state-mandated tests that take up the first three hours of every day this week.  If you don't have a test, you either come in three hours late or have to find some way to entertain yourself at school.  Today was the Geometry test, which I already took last year.  I couldn't get in at 10:40, so I was stuck there for three hours.  I ended up doing a lot of chemistry homework and just messing around online in the computer lab.  After the period was up it was a fairly normal day, with Spanish then lunch then half-periods of gym and chemistry, and then English.  In chemistry Mr. Pham gave us a take home quiz, saying he is "expecting all students will do this quiz by themselves - without obtaining assistance from any sources" even though the point is to review for the final.  How can we review when we're not allowed to look at our notes?  Well, I'm off to the chat room to do the quiz.  Until next time.

      Wow, Super Smash Bros. Melee beat Grand Theft Auto: Vice City in the  urlLink GameFAQS  best game ever bracket.  For those that don't understand the importance of this, the big deal is that a game with classic characters, a celebration of Nintendo's legacy, defeated a 'modern' game, which really only sold because of sex and violence.  I'm not saying GTA: VC was a bad game, it's far from it, but this just proves that the more "hardcore" gamers still support the classic games, and not cheap thrills.  More on this later, time to prepare for the next week.

      The cicadas have invaded.  I guess they've been here for two or three weeks now, but I didn't really notice them until a few days ago.  For some reason I completely hate them, more so than other bugs (which I'm not exactly fond of either).  Maybe it's the weird, pudgy bodies.  Maybe it's the eerie metallic hum that sounds like aliens are invading (and is a sound as intense at close range as a jet plane taking off, or so I've heard).  Or maybe it's the fact that I can hardly take a step without stepping on them or their shells.  I just don't like cicadas.  It's not that I'm scared of them, but the people who pick them up, carry them around, let them walk on their bodies, and eat them are pretty crazy in my opinion.  I help coach my 11-year old brother Dylan's baseball team (my dad's the head coach) and I was at their game on Saturday.  (We lost 31-5, but that's not really relevent right now.)  The first base side of the field is right next to the woods, and we were the visitors.  (For those who don't know baseball, the visiting team's bench is on the first base side and the home team's bench is on the third base side.)  So cicadas were everywhere.  For some reason or another I let someone know I don't exactly like cicadas, so the next thing I know one of the players and the seven-year old brother of another are collecting them and trying to get them on me.  Fun.  Probably more enjoyable than focusing on the 26 run loss, though.

      Welcome to my new blog.  I can't stand the boring intro stuff, so if you want to know anything about me, just read my profile.  I'll try to keep this blog updated, but I've never been good at anything diary-like.  This'll probably just be for my random thoughts and ramblings, whenever I'm bored enough.

      School is finally over!  On Thursday I had math and Spanish exams, both were insanely easy.  Today was history and English.  Both were easy, but a lot of the questions on the English exam were very subjective and had multiple possible answers.  Whatever, not like I really need an A on it.  After exams I went to the magnet (special program I'm in) picnic, which was worse than I expected.  That's pretty bad, because I expected it to suck.  The only reason I went was because I wanted to play in the freshman-sophmore vs junior football game, which we couldn't have due to rain.  So I left after an hour and a half since my dad was off because of Reagan's funeral.  (I'll get into my disgust of all this nonsense with the Reagan funeral later.)  Tonight my dad and I had tickets for the Orioles vs Giants game.  We get to Baltimore, spend $7 for parking, $2 for peanuts, and my dad buys a $6 slice of pizza, and THEN they cancel the game.  What fun.  Not bad being in Baltimore anyway, but kind of a bummer.  Well that's it for tonight.  I'm actually going to try and relax a little after all this stress with exams.

      Exams are underway.  Yesterday I had my computer science exam, which was a little harder than I expected, but still easy enough.  I got two A's this semester, so I'm fine for my semester grade unless I get lower than a C, wich isn't happenning.  My chemistry teacher, Mr. Pham, has been out with chicken pox (he never had it before since he lived in Vietnam as a kid) for the past few days.  He somehow recovered in under a week and was back for our exam today.  The exam was a lot easier than I expected, 115 multiple choice questions in two hours.  He was nice for a change and gave us ten free extra credit points for writing about our opinions on the class.  That means I could get a 94/115 on the actual exam and still get an A with the extra credit!  I may actually get a B or A in chemistry now.  Excellent.  I tried out this new AudioBlogger thing a few minutes ago.  It seemed pretty cool, but it didn't actually record anything in my post.  Strange...  I doubt I'd use it even if it did work though, the long-distance fees must really pile on.  Tomorrow I have two exams, Spanish and pracalculus.  I went double-A in Spanish, so I'm not worried about that.  In precal I went B-A the two quarters, which means I have to get an A if I want an A for the semester.  Hopefully I'll do well on that.  EDIT: Right after I made this post I noticed that the AudioBlogger thing didn't play anything because I didn't have my speakers on.  I am a dumbass.
