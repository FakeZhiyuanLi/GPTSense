      Lately I realize that my problems are not the worst thing in the world . . . does this mean I am cured?  Not likely, but I have realized that despite what I may not have, that does nothing to devalue those things I have had all my life.  My values, my beliefs, my principles . . . whatever you call it, I have them.  I have friends, I have family, I have my physical health . . . all things I should be grateful of, and I am going to practice for the future.  I only hope that this doesn't end up in a 'only down from here' mood :)

      Busy, busy, busy!  Well, since I have a readership that includes . . . me!  I will continue to post here as if that was *not* the case, hehe.  The last two months have been the most  ctively productive months of my life.  I don't ever say 'I don't have anything to do.'  Instead,  I work on managing my time so that I can get everything done that needs to be  done.  I have been travelling so much (6 hours at home in 6 weeks!), but it is great.  I don't really need a home . . . I need to stay busy.  With that in mind, I am working on moving this site over to my own server soon, and registering my own domain.  With that done, once I have free time I shall begin massively overhauling my web site.  I am going to write the page from the ground up with notepad and maintain it exclusively on a Unix server.  Will this happen?  Not likely, but I am gonna try.  Any computer geeks out there?  I just saw the most wicked water-cooling system, that combined with a beautiful cold-cathode UV mod kit, means that I have a serious goal.  I made about 800 dollars building one computer, and I have a couple more lined up - so I may achieve my goal.  What is my goal?  Since I am talking to the wall, let me speak!  a p4 2.66GHz processor with 2GB of DDR memory.  a pair of 120GB 7200rpm HDs, a 256MB nvidia graphics card, an audigy sound card with 6.1 surround speakers and a 300+ watt subwoofer.  a 21inch LCD display, a beautiful plexiglass/carbon fiber case with an array of internal color-changing cathodes and matching UV sensitive wiring running a total liquid cooling system that is pumping UV tinted water - all using a sound-programmed UV light to amplify the toy.  Well, that is a generic overview, not including shit like chipsets, fsb speeds, etc etc - you should get the idea if any of those numbers make sense.

      Tomorrow . . . or is it later today?  That is a ramble for another time I suppose . . I intend on posting some more substantial information about myself, or rather I should say - the workings and rants of my mind, which are what this page is all about.  I want to hook it up with some information about what my plans are over the long and short term periods I have before me.  Til then, that dark place where my eyelids protect me calls . . .

      According to some people, alcoholism is a crime, underage drinking is a sin, and stumbling home drunk at 3am in the morning with your friends is about the worst thing you can do to your own future.  Yet I can't help but wonder just what my life would have been like had I been able to have these conscience-clear journeys into my own mind.  Could I have helped myself get over various childhood phobias and disorders just by drinking and becoming comfortable with my own identity?  I feel the answer is yes, but I wonder just how far I would have gone.  The law is a double-edged sword, that harms you just as often as it protects you.  This recent discovery on the mispublication of the long-term effects of MDMA is just a single example, but it sets my own intoxicated mind off on an adventure of self-discovery and realization that I don't think would be possible without the use of foreign toxins.  But what do I know, it is only my mind.

      It is just after 9 pm, and im listening to europop in jersey.  how surreal can you get?  On a side note, this is an interesting story for those of us who explore the effects mind altering substances.  Worth a read for those who actually want to know WHAT we do to ourselves, right?  http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2051669

      Responsibility is such an arduous word.  Just the sound of it rolling over your tongue and through your lips can weigh your spirit down.  There are types of people in this world who deal with responsibility, and other people who shirk their own responsibilities, leaving their burden for the mainstream.  And here I am, struggling to cross over to the other side . . . but I don't know which side I am starting on.

      The sun is rising behind me, I can feel it looking over my shoulders.  The shadows remind me that as the day breaks, I am long displaced from sleep.  The speakers are humming some noise that does not have meaning to me, but I am in a typical manic mood.  The world is at my fingertips, and I can't stop moving them.  This new project is keeping me busy, but for how long?  Will it sustain me, or merely distract me?  In the long view of things, I wonder how great the difference really is, maybe it is all transitory in my mind?  I'll end this post now, because the thought of entering my mind is enough to dampen my mood, no matter how high my artificial euphoria is carrying me.

      Sometimes the world seems to be just outside the feeble grasp of my reaching fingertips.  When this happens to me, I escape to a world where I have just a little more control.  A world of type, text, links and control.  This becomes my world-inside-a-world.  This is my reality.

      I want to start this entry by adding the observation that I have no recollection of the previous entry, whatsoever.  Next,  I lack a true imagination.  Dreams, imagery, even my memories are expressed through a foggy haze in my mind's eye.  To realize that i have a defection that defines my existence, I have to actualize and observe this fault, but how do you observe and verify the 'lack' of a trait?  Is this why i am so impulsive?  Do i wish to confirm the faults of one sense by affirming the existence and functionality of all my other faculties?  In a twisted way, i doubt the sincerity of my own motives; but why do i feel that my life is a deception?  Is my life a lie, or are lies the definition of my being?  at this line, i shall interject my appreciation of cyberspeak for putting into symbols something that i could not otherwise express with words.  and i quote - ':P'  i think i have deflected positively another attempt of my mind to rejoin itself.  and until this moment, i had not realized that such a fracture existed.  if i write now the thoughts in my my fingers, i run the danger of losing the existence of my ignorant bliss.  and so i have decided to keep this secret, but i shall retain the smug satisfaction of knowing that i almost understood the 'why' that has followed my every observation of self in the past.  as the music washes away my insight, i am going to slide to a new train of thought.  this is the third time, and just as has happened twice before, this feels totally unknown, and i wonder if this is normal, or another expression of my own faults and shortcomings.  do i even possess the capacity of retention that i must assume others own?

      I am happy.  Yay for me, and hurrah for boring tales, right?  Guess what?  Its my journal so either like it or blow me!    The reasons I am so happy are something I am not gonna put here, because I am afraid for my happiness.  Like a mother, I know that soon this feeling will be taken from me, and I want to hold on to this happiness for as long as I can manage to exert my will upon it.  My good friend, Delirium is here, yay!  im gonna rolll!  woot!

      all my years of rambling thoughts have come to nothing, and today i have realized that i won't ever be normal.  until i end my life, i am going to go through my existence surrounded by people who won't ever understand the tiniest fraction of my mind's workings.  i don't know that i am ever going to age, emotionally.  i will probably still drool over shiny objects and stare wondrously at flashing lights til the end of my days.    i don't know what to say.  this is either the most incredible or most horrific realiztion i have ever made, yet i can not classify it.  for some reason all i can think of are the colors that exist in my mind, and the curious lack of distinction that characterizes them all inside my own imagination.  i went off subject again, my bad.  i want a puppy :(  a little male siberian husky puppy named kwirl.

      I have yet again defeated the sun in a race for the morning.  But in my victory, I feel a defeat as well, because my mind is clamouring for a return to slumber, and, unforseen circumstances notwithstanding, I shall relent.  Why am I writing today, when I have gone so long without comment?  I can't honestly say, a desire to express myself overwhelmed me, so here I stand before you, awaiting judgement from the nonexistent masses.  Hurrah for me.   Have you ever woken only to wonder why you are awake?  Do you go through the motions of life, without feeling?  Does the tiniest disappointment send you spiraling downwards into the abyss of apathy?    Soon, I tell myself.  Soon, I will be normal.  I will be whole.  I will be healed.  Soon.  I hope.

      so, my parents conceived me while drunk and drugged up.  i was almost an abortion statistic.  my parents were married in a state prison.  my parents then split.  i was kicked around a lot.  my mom cried.  my grandmother raises me without my parents.  in my teenage years, my parents decide they should come be a part of my life.  then, they change their mind.  i have problems, they don't know what to do with me.  tried kicking me around again, im 6 feet taller and 200lbs heavier, so that doesn't work.  i get thrown into the world on my own at 17.    surprise, i can't cope with society and lack the basic ability to deal with people.  i have anxiety issues, bipolar affective disorder, and lets face it - a substance addiction problem.  not to anything in particular, but anything that lets me forget about as much of my life as i can do at a single sitting.  the drugs are kicking in now, i can feel my skin tingling hehe.  i guess soon i will be forgiving my parents.  yay.  today my dad yelled at me for something he did wrong that i didn't fix.  i walked far away and cried.  i am 25 years old.

      talk about stunned.  i just got a very long letter from my mom.  i spilled my thoughts in a letter to her some time ago, and i just got a response.  she told me the story of, well, me.  why i was born, where and why my parents were together for such a short time, why i was abandoned.  its a lot to take in, i am going to try very hard not to get upset.  i can't be depressed.  it isn't fair to everyone.  god dammit.  it isn't fair to me, is it?  i will be back after the drugs kick in.

      I miss you, blog :)  well, i am walking the streets that i grew up on.  the changes are depressing.  schools being torn down, homes abandoned, business closing their doors.   is it a localized issue, or are communities everywhere subject to this form of degradation?  the playground where i had my first fist fight.  the parks where i used to play basketball.  the homes where my friends forgot about the world.  the corners where i saw people killed.  the old guy on the corner who cut my hair for 3 dollars.  MY memories are going to be gone, and when i go, there will be nothing.  nothing but a widened interstate.  i saw a group of kids playing football, and for a long time i watched them, unseen.  they were young, my age.  i watched them pass and run and fight and play.  they were innocent.  they were just beginning to realize that they were poor, that they would soon be stereotyped.  the poor kids from the ghetto.  destined to fail, certain to be problem children.  i don't know if i will ever get beyond being raised with the words 'you can't' and 'you aren't' echoing in my every action or thought.  but i know that i want to help change that.  i want to work with the meanest, poorest, most destitute children that our country is birthing.  i want to tell them all that they can, and if i do that, then i will be proof.

        This morning I woke up, surprised to discover that the morning was today, and that tomorrow would eventually follow.  My mind raced in circles and my thoughts wandered elsewhere, but the world continued spinning, without cognition of my existence.    In a few days I am gonna leave for Florida due to a death in the family issue that does not yet affect my writing on this site.  I should be gone from 3 days to 3 weeks, but I don't expect an overlong trip, regardless.    Sometimes I observe people, for the sake of comparison with all things, myself included.  I watch their behavior, their reactions, their  tendencies.  I try not to include myself in such observation episodes, but I am unable to avoid the possibility of such action at times.    I see people  that live their lives, lacking meaning, purpose, motivation, or ambition.  Do I think of myself in the same light?    No, I don't.  At the moment, my life is taking a back seat to the healing of my mind, something that a handful of years ago I did not believe would be possible.  I have many ambitions and a collage of motivations.  I write here now to remind myself of that, because I know soon I will enter a period that will be hard for me to remember why I exist in the manner I do now.    I live to learn, to observe, and to help others make the world a better place for themselves and those who will follow.  I live to acknowledge and appreciate the contributions of well-intentioned individuals who have come before me, and paved a path through life that I might follow by example.  I live to see tomorrow, and what tomorrow may one day hold, and I live so that one day, I can make someone else's tomrrow a better thing.  I live for the world I will one day leave behind, but I do not live for any individual.  I do not live for a man, woman, or child.  I do not live for myself.  I do not live so that I might amass wealth, unless the wealth is of a spiritual or mental type.    My wealth would be the reward of giving hope to those who need it, and understanding to those who lack it.    If I could live for no other purpose, but to immerse myself totally in such an existence, I wonder if I would have cause to call myself 'depressed', as the medical definition of my illness indicates.    Perhaps, perhaps not.  Time may share that secret with me, if I need to know.

      I have struggled very hard to avoid depression lately, but I have given in this time, frustrated at the futility of my efforts.  Nothing in particular has brought this on, but the culmination of many smaller events have compiled into this pathetic excuse of a mind I own to bring on this current episode.  It is getting worse, too.  I don't know when it will apex, but I am scared.  I feel helpless, alone, distraught.  I want to scream, I want to hide, I want to just hear somebody tell me I am not alone.  I want to get help, I want to find help, I want help.  What should I do?  I can't tell people around me how I feel, because I do not want them to worry about me needlessly, but I am striving for an answer.  I just want to know that it will go away.  I just want a friend.  I just want to be . . .   I haven't eaten in two days, I don't want to eat any more.  I want to just sleep my life away.  I want to crawl into the bed and hide in the comforting darkness.  I only have one reason to stay awake, but even that is something that I worry about, so I can't really win.  I am trying to distract myself with projects, but I can not keep up the focus in the way that I would traditionally find so easy.  Why, if so many people have what I suffer from, do we not have help?  Is it because I can't afford it?  I don't know where to turn, my credit is already ruined from unpaid medical expenses because I am incapable of keeping a single job long enough to get health coverage.  It is not because I am incapable, but it is because I struggle with these episodes that affect my reliability.  I can not control them, I can not predict them, I can not stop them.  Music keeps me sane, but it does not keep me healthy.

      I don't know what to do.  The morning sky is being illuminated by the slowly rising sun, and nothing is more terrifying to me at this moment.  I am alone.  I am scared.  It is so hard to explain these basic statements, but I am escaping to this blog for help.  I am hoping that my rope shall find a vessel to salvage me from this wreck of a life.  I don't want to live for anyone else any longer.  I don't have a reason to live for myself.  I hate myself.

      "If we could sniff or swallow something that would, for five or six hours each day, abolish our solitude as individuals, atone us with our fellows in a glowing exaltation of affection and make life in all its aspects seem not only worth living, but divinely beautiful and significant, and if this heavenly, world-transfiguring drug were of such a kind that we could wake up next morning with a clear head and an undamaged constitution-then, it seems to me, all our problems (and not merely the one small problem of discovering a novel pleasure) would be wholly solved and earth would become paradise."

        The materialistic nature of capitalism does a deceptively apt job of disguising the possibilities.  We live in a land of opportunity that is defined by selling yourself to the highest bidder, when the culmination of potential is hidden beneath a tangled web of taxes, laws, codes, regulations and any number of other obstacles on the path to your particular goals.    People don't seem to grasp the simple joys that are at our disposal, and often my search for these 'spiritual' goals is met by incredulous responses from a vast range of alternative pursuits that are deemed 'more important'    Money is just not a driving force in my ambitions, and unless some major personality conflict arises, I do not believe that it ever will be.  My ultimate realization will be defined by happiness and a sense of self worth at getting to my final resting place having used as few people as possible to do such.    I know I promised to keep my writing 'on-topic' but this particular mini-rant has been breathing inside me for some time.    I may return.

        There is a part of my mind that sometimes tells me to do something that should not be done.  This of itself is harmless, but the trouble seems to be that it finds the part of me that instinctively does as told, and with the former often combines to get me in trouble.    The wheels of mania are slowly starting to turn, but I almost am afraid to let them start grinding, knowing as I do the inevitable consequences of these actions.  Music.  Always a blissful distraction.  I read a couple short paragraphs in french, and managed to understand a respectable percentage of what i read, and i even pronounced it correctly, albeit with many stumbles.  I had a good teacher.    The prospect of teaching to me would be an enormously rewarding one, but I can't help but wonder if I should attempt to move along in a career path that would really make me happy - computer game development/design.  It seems such a simple thing, find what you wish to do - then execute.  In my mind the road I need to travel is perfectly clear, but when I open my eyes, the distance is long and my sight is fogged, my feet stumble and my courage falters.     For myself the gaps in life never close, but I find an unending supply of alternate means to the various ends I wish to achieve.  What exactly does this mean, if anything?      Maybe things that mean nothing gain values assigned inside my head using some destructive algorithm that delights in the mechinations of confusing me and imposing these conflictions on my resolve.    Hating your own mind because you love it so much is an interesting emotion.  Try it sometimes, if you think you can :)

      As is always the case after a really low depressive episode, I rebound with an overabundance of hypomanic energy that will eventually lead to yet another crash in my mood, but for now, there is no worry.    I have been busy planning, but there is work yet to be done - I am not yet ready to finalize my plan, but I am drafting them in my mind.  The support from a friend that means much to me has helped me spring forward in a manner more positively and quickly than in the past.  I have even been inspired to do something that as a rule I almost never allow myself to do - resurrect an old ambition anew.  The support I have gotten from various channels with my writing is encouraging.  the RYW crew puts stock in my abilities, and the unfailingly positive remarks made of my writing in my mail cheer me, and I will neglect the thought that it is all just people being nice and kind to me, as such is never the case.  While I hate this mislabeled holiday in my favorite season, it appears that my mood cycles will make this one a good one, yet.

      one in the morning, and all is well . . . right?  hehe, its funny how the little things, responsible in so many ways for the tumultuous mood swings i endure, can swing me up as they can swing me down.  if only i could remember to recall that information when it is needed!  my vacation plans for europe have changed from three weeks to one week, which is cool with me, as long as mon and angel have a good time it will be worth it.  i wonder at the significance of daily life and the impact it has on the integrity of my emotions.  it just doesn't seem right to work so disproportionately.

      When i dont think about anything, there is no depression or anxiety, but i am unable to accomplish anything.  attempting to actually do something productive initializes the process by which the problems spring into existance.  the more positive the impact on my life, the worse my disappointment after the inevitable failure.  so, to be happy, i need to be a failure, which in turn makes me miserable.  i would love to see a math formula proving the certainty of my destiny.  there was a time that i knew how to write and solve formulas, oh well.

      Today's Evaluation for the Masses: The Salton Sea Category: Movie Starring: Val Kilmer -------    In order to find justice for his wife's killers, a trumpet player must lose himself in a world of drugs and degradation.      The most beautiful thing about this movie is the character's near-total loss of self identity.  The glimpses into his past are adequately obscure, and the viewer can busy himself with enviously watching this man take a lifestyle and call it his own.    This movie has the right amount of all the right stuff.  What does that mean?  It means that its worth seeing, dipshit.  Go rent it today.  BANG!  What was that?  That was an 8.

      Today's Evaluation for the Masses: Mainstream Category: Music Artist: Outkast -------    The meaning of this track is probably open to interpretation from anyone short of the author.  My immediate impression is that it reflects a youthful fear of being caught in an inevitable yet apparent rut without escape.   This is one of my favorite Outkast tracks, but it is interesting to compare the production styles of this song as compared to their more recent work.  Personally, I prefer the downtempo sound that was prevalent with ATLiens.      This work scores an effortless 7.

      Today's Evaluation for the Masses: In the Shadows Category: Music Artist: The Rasmus -------    Ok, at first glance these guys look like another sappy goth group, ready to whine about the injustices they suffer for being moody losers.    Then, BAM!  This song goes off in another direction totally, it is about a psychopath stalking a hot chick!  While the fundamentals beneath the surface of the song may be rooted in the dateless goth culture, stalking is something we can all appreciate.      Not only that, the group does a very respectable job at actually rocking, with a solid sound and a catchy beat.  This is a surprise winner that only the unenlightened will fail to appreciate for what it truly is, an anthem for young killers waiting to emerge from their shells.    This work gets a solid 8.

        It is time that I dust off insomnissues and repair the damage of my neglect.  For the immediate future, my new purpose with insomnissues will be to address a problem I have discovered is more widespread than I had once imagined.    People have opinions that vary from my own, and they presume to be correct in such instances!  Using the power of the Blog, I will begin commenting on and evaluating one artistic creation at a time, and justifying why my view is correct as I do so.  Keep in mind, sometimes you may not understand what I am rambling about, and certain potent drugs could render my speech unintelligible.  In either instance, just look up the words you don't know, and pretend I'm right.    I will be, anyway.

        The void that is caused by an unfulfilled potential stabs deep.  It twists and turns, wrenching at my mind like a spiteful parasite.    And I have no one to blame but myself.

      Today's Evaluation for the Masses: The Reason Category: Music Artist: Hoobastank -------  Ok, lets get the basics out of the way.  Yes, the radio plays it entirely too much.  Is that all you have to use against it?  That established, the song is a potent combination of amazing vocals and sappy lyrics.  Yes, I enjoy both of those weaknesses, move on please.  The melody is nice, the hook is catchy, the vocals are impressive, and the instrumentals are solid to say the least.  This one will be around for a long time, and will have more fans than the artist themselves will, I imagine.  A memorable song, worthy of a 6.

      Today's Evaluation for the Masses: American History X Category: Movie Starring: Edward Norton -------  Every so often, a movie comes along with a message.  A potent, powerful message that changes how you look at the world when you wake up.  One that forces you to reconsider everything you use as criteria to make decisions.  Usually, Oprah tells us to watch those movies, and nobody with two balls between their legs wants to see that crap.  But American History X is different, its a movie with a purpose, with a message, and with some pretty fucking awesome storyline to keep you company.  The extent of the love story in this movie involves a woman with a hot set of DSL's taking it rough, and a brother telling his little sibling to go give it to the blonde outside.  That is a true romance.  Warning, this movie has more than just some incredible violence, there is a man getting ass raped by Aryans in a prison shower.  Way, way too much of that, but I just fast forward to the crying afterwards.  Great movie, not much to complain about here!  1, 2 . . . 9!  That's right!

      Today's Evaluation for the Masses: Fight Club Category: Movie Starring: Brad Pitt, Edward Norton -------    Have you ever fantasized about using anarchy to create order?  Have you destroyed something so you could enjoy the creation of something in its place?  Do you masturbate while wearing big yellow latex gloves?    If you answered yes to any of those questions, then this movie is going to be one hell of a treat for you.  From making little girls cry to blowing up entire industries, I just can't think of many bad things to say about this movie.  Every other line spoken has become a slogan on a T-shirt somewhere, the music is enthralling, and the acting will probably be remembered as the highest point in the vast majority of the cast members' careers.    What was wrong with this movie?  I could complain about the ending, but the ending was as near to perfect as anything could have come.  I could complain about the acting, but I would be lying to let myself off the hook.    In order to say something negative about this movie, I am going to gripe that it pisses me off that other people have seen this flick.  I want the damn thing to be all my own.  If you don't watch this movie, you aren't cool.    Period.  How many fingers am I holding up?  You're god damn right, 10.

      There is a blatant pattern to the cycles of my mental states, I become excited about something first; then the excitement fades to guarded optimism; soon that is replaced by paranoia; then we have the wonderful familiar friend, disgusted knowledge of certain impending failure.  Sometimes this cycle can take hours, sometimes days, but it is always present, always the same.  How can this not be normal?  It sucks, the older I get the worse it is becoming.  The hard part is learning more and more that these are my problems, and I do not share them with the world.
