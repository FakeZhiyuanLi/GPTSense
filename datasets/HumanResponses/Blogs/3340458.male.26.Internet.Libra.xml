      ...that don't even bother to do something about it.  The last couple of days i've listened to a couple of people here at work and some friends bitch and complain about the government and the state of affairs in this country.  Those same people have made it clear they're not going to vote on June 28th because they "don't care".  Holy Christ!!!  Now there's some intelligence for ya.  I told one person to downright grow the f*ck up.  You're a Canadian adult, it's your right to vote and your duty to help get this country out of the shithole it's in right now.  I've always voted Liberal.  I'm not sure I have many liberal ideologies anymore and it all comes down to one simple fact.  The Liberals currently in power need to go, and someday there will be new faces in the party who don't have their heads up their asses and then it will be time to bring the Liberals back.  I'm going to be voting Conservative.  Dare I say that once I see the way things are going I may become a hardcore conservative.  If you don't know anything about politics then here's all you need to know...  On June 28th, go vote Conservative.  Things in this country will get better.  Learn to look out for yourselves.  Don't buy in to sap stories on the news that bleed the country of millions of dollars.   TGIF!

      I'm sitting here looking at the clear blue sky then glancing back at the weather forecast that calls for rain this morning, blue sky, then back to the weather forecast.  F*ck me, i'm in the wrong line of work!  I should be a weatherman.  I mean come on, it's a job where you're wrong 80% of the time and you don't get fired.  If I was a weatherman, there would be no bullshit.  Forecast will only really vary with the seasons...  Spring/Summer: Today's forecast:  If you look up and it's clear skies, it's gonna be sunny.  Wear sunscreen so you don't burn, jackass.  If you look up and there are clouds, then it's gonna be cloudy or cloudy and sunny.  If at some point those clouds turn grey, it's gonna rain.  If those clouds are really dark, it's gonna piss rain.  Fall: Today's forecast:  If you look up and it's clear skies, it's gonna be sunny but probably cold because f*cking winter is just around the corner.  If you look up and it's not clear skies, then just stay inside and cover the windows.  You don't want to be in or see the shit that will be going on outside.  Winter: Todays's forecast:  It's gonna be f*cking cold.  Even if it's clear skies, snow will probably sneak up on us at any moment and add shit to shit that's already shit.  You'll likely slip somewhere today and break something.  Take a leave of abscence from your job and go back to work in the Spring.   Ok, i'm done venting.  Sarcasm is the best medicine.  Steve's is open past 5:30 today so I can go pickup a pack of Elixr strings for my guitar.  F*cking figures, I go there last Friday to get a pack just because I felt like changing them before I ran into problems and they didn't have any mediums left; on Tuesday I broke my D string (what are the odds).  I swear to God if I go there and they don't have any mediums left, there's gonna be some commotion.  One of the best known stores in Ontario and they run out of Elixr strings, Jesus.  It's the same as a car dealer saying, "Um sorry, we don't have any cars on the lot right now". FYI, Elixr guitar strings are the "cat's ass" of guitar strings.  Once you try them, you realize there's nothing better and you've spent years wasting your money on a shitty brand that gives you a cool sticker in every pack *cough* Dean Markley Blue Steel *cough*.  Well, time to finish up some crap here at work and then i'll spend my time until 8am productively by reading for my IID course.  P.S. F*ck the weathermen, "F*ck them up their stupid asses"

      Just finished playing Molly Maid.  Jen went lilac crazy over the weekend and although those things smell nice, when they start to die they have a smell that just gets to me.  More BBQ tonight; beef tournados and damn they were good.  Still getting used to the cooking times on this BBQ though.  Seems like I gotta cook everything on low but i'm not sure low is really low.  Seems more like it has two settings, hot and hotter.  Oh well, it was free from my dad and it's a kickass BBQ so I won't complain too much.  I watched American Idol tonight although that type of competition doesn't interest me much.  From what I saw, one girl was a spinoff of Macey Gray and the other was another version of Hilary Duff meets Mandy Moore.  They need to get away from the pop and mix it up with some rock.  American Idol with bands competing would be much more entertaining.  Oh goodie f*cking gumdrops, look at the time.  Gotta get ready for work.  On another sour note, i'm seriously starting to get pissed at my IID prof.  The guy can't give a straight answer and i'm starting to wonder if he's a descendant of Apelonia.  And on that note, cue the music.

      Just got up, stumbled into the living room and what do I see?  A huge plant pot we have filled to the rim with water.  I ain't no plant expert but I do know what too much water looks like.  Oh well, that plant takes up too much room, I hope it drowns.  Well slap me in the ass and call me Suzie; my IID professor FINALY got back to me and answered all my questions I had posted before the weekend.  More importantly, he approved my survey topic so i'm rolling out that mofo tonight.  I'm so happy I got it all ready yesterday.  I'm litteraly 3 weeks ahead of the game now.  Gotta go jump in the shower and then go pick up my niece.  Weather looks like I might get away with doing some BBQ'ing tonight.  I'll keep my fingers crossed.

      Holy crap, I don't know what's wrong with me right now but i'm restless and aggrivated.  To make matters worse, they turn off the A/C in the building at night so i'm feeling toasty right now.  I feel like I should go for a walk outside or something to burn off the extra energy but it's raining.  I finally got that godamn survey for my IID course put together.  I hope my prof gives it the ok.  I want to get it done and then start on that term paper.  I HATE writting essays although I always manage to produce good work.  I didn't realize the date; I better go register for Criminology on Friday.  More money :P  As I gaze out the office window, I see some bozo standing right in the middle of the road and he hasn't moved in a couple of minutes.  The police pass by every 5 minutes max so I should get some entertainment very shortly.  Ah, I can't take this anymore, i'm too restless.  I'm gonna go downstairs and get a front row seat to this idiot standing in the middle of the street have a run-in with the cops.

      Had a good evening.  Brother is over and we had 1 and 1/4 inch THICK T-Bones for super on the BBQ that were crazy good.  We watched the race and I knew my brother would enjoy this one.  Dale Jr was screwing around on the high side and I think that cost him the race.  Maybe he's trying too hard to step out of his father's shadow and do his own thing.  My brother helped me to install the A/C in my room better so now it's draining properly.  I bought some algicide to try and get rid of the musty smell but i'm not convinced it worked well.  Time to polish off the Bud Light we got today and watch a movie or something.  Hopefully get a better night's sleep than yesterday.

      I'm sitting here wondering what the hell ever happened to the cartoons I used to watch on Saturday mornings when I was a kid.  No wonder kids are screwed up now days, I just surfed the channels twice and all I can find is Japanese themed cartoons that are violent as hell.  Not that Wiley Coyote didn't show me some pretty insane shit in my day but this stuff is on a different level that some crazy kid could actually act upon.  What happened to Transformers, G.I. Joe, Looney Tunes, Snorks, Smurfs and the other stuff from the 80s and early 90s???? OMG, speaking of shit, I just saw the preview for Dodgeball.  Man is that ever gonna flop at the box office.  Didn't they say it was going to rain today?  It looks pretty nice to me.  I'm debating whether I should go tanning and risk another week-long sunburn.  So, another night race tonight.  For those of you who don't know about NASCAR or think that you don't like it, I suggest you turn on TSN at 7:00 and watch the race for a bit.  It's a different format of race called the All-Star Challenge and the winner takes a cool million bucks.  Well, i've got less than 3 hours before Jen goes to work so I better go do all my running around before I don't have access to the car for the rest of the day.  There's nothing I really NEED, but there's lots of things I WANT to buy ;)

      Just started my shift and, 22 minutes into it, i'm already bored.  Only 7 and 1/2 hours to go.  I brought my guitar tonight so i'll work on those 3 songs I wrote that need lyrics to finish them off.  Didn't do much in the evening before coming to work; kind of a blah night.  It's nice and cool in the condo with the A/C but there is water in the window frame of the bedroom.  Not sure if it's because of the rain or because the air conditioner isn't draining properly.  Better take care of that tomorrow before it becomes a big problem.  I'll probably have to Newfie-rig something.  From Rick's Dictionary....  Newfie-rig, (verb): To solve a problem with only readily - always inappropriate - materials that will make somebody who is knowledgeable in the correct way to solve such a problem say "who is the fucking idiot who did that?"    ex: Johnny is going to Newfie-rig his dragging/rusted exhaust by tying it to the car with a shoe lace.  Newfie-rig, (noun): The grouping of materials that make up the crackpot solution; usualy result in the problem becoming a larger one.  ex: Pete used a Newfie-rig to patch the hole in his boat and now he's thinking up a Newfie-rig to get the boat back from the bottom of the lake.   So yeah, use the Newfie-rig wisely.  Sometimes a Newfie-rig can be quite good though.  For example you can Newfie-rig anything quite well with duct tape or JB weld.  If you don't know what JB weld is, it's a compound that goes on like glue but when it dries it's almost as strong as steel.  If you get JB weld dried on your skin, go to the doctor and expect to lose that area.  While we're on the subject of dumb ideas; how about those Liberals eh?  Can you say BUH BYE in June?  I'd rather shove a fondue fork up my pee-hole than vote for those lying pricks to come back for another term.  First they steal 250 million dollars from us (fuck anybody who thinks Paul Martin didn't know about it at the time) and now they've bent us over and shoved a 12 incher up our asses with the recent budget.  Here's what it comes down to people...  The election is coming.  All the various parties are made up of FUCKING IDIOTS.  It's up to everybody to sit down and research which FUCKING IDIOT they want to vote for that will cause the least FUCKING DAMAGE.  It doesn't matter who we vote for.  Vote Liberal: we already know what will happen.  Vote Conservative: shit of a slightly different flavor but still shit when it's all said and done.  Ah fuck it, i'm just getting really pissed now.  Let's change the subject....  I'm getting a little hungry and I always get take-out to eat on Fridays.  The only place open at this time around here makes crap food but beggers can't be chosers.  On that note I guess i'll order something and do something to pass time; more work on my friggin' IID survey maybe.

      Sunburn update:  My back is starting to peel BAD!  I'm so itchy right now I look like i'm doing the twist in my chair.    Before coming to work at midnight, I spent the entire evening installing the two air conditioners at our place.  Turned out to be a bigger job than I anticipated.  I went home earlier to watch the Smallville season finale that I taped.  I must say it wasn't what I was expecting.  It didn't get really interesting until the last 5 minutes and then the last minute they hit the viewers with like 3 bombshells.  Next season's premiere should be something to see.  The first major assignment in my IID course (worth 25%) is to conduct a survey.  The topic has to be something from the "key terms" in our textbook.  Talk about VAGUE!  I was able to make more sense out of it from the professor's description; I think I know what he's looking for.  I'll make sure to chose something controversial to make it interesting.  Maybe something like prejudice and pull an interesting hypothesis statement that will actually make people want to DO the survey.  Luckily I have a large amount of cultural diversity at my disposal at work so I can get some meaningful data.  I'm pretty sure almost all races/nationalities are represented here in the office.  I want to do the survey online; no way in hell i'm passing out papers and waiting for people to fill them out.  I just spent the last hour or so trying to find a tool or a website to make an online survey;  MAN THERE'S A LOT OF HORSESHIT ON THE NET!  It took forever to find a site that was actually good.  I want to get this assignment taken care of quickly so crap doesn't pile up.  I don't think it's due for another 3 weeks at least.  I wonder what the hell the rest of the class is doing.  Nobody but me has posted anything for the Chapter 1 discussion.  From reading the introductions on the message board it's apparent that most of the class consists of people that failed it at the college and are having to take it online during the summer.  Glad to see there putting in the extra effort the second time *insert sarcasm here*.  OH F*CK ME IN THE GOAT ASS!!!!  I just wiped my hands with Bacti Control -- you know that antibacterial lotion -- and I just realized my hands are all banged up from the work I did installing the A/C last night; JESUS CHRIST IT STINGS!!  Don't feel like biking in the rain; is today supposed to be nice??? Let's see what www.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca says....  60% chance of showers.  There's only a 2% chance that they're actually right so, whatever.  Jen is off today so i'll send her to get Makayla; uncle Rick needs SLEEP today.  Just because I said that I bet I won't be able to sleep when I get home like the two past days.  Well I guess i'll see if I can pull a magic trick out of my ass and get that survey all planned out before I leave at 8am.  Would be a huge weight of my shoulders and one hell of a head start.   Until the next rambling episode...

      I just woke up, I'm tired as hell again and my head is pounding.  I ended up going to Home Depot this morning and picking up the stuff I need to install the air conditioner.  Looks like i'll have to go back though seeing as how, when the A/C is in,my setup to block out the daylight so I can sleep during the day will need to be modified.  I'd like to install it when I get back from picking up Makayla in a bit but powertools around that kid is a bad idea.  When it comes to trouble, she's like a moth to a flame.  Well it looks really nice outside, time to drag my ass into the shower and go get my niece.

      *singing*... Put the lime in the coconut, drink them both together,  Put the lime in the coconut, then you feel better,  Put the lime in the coconut, drink them both up,  Put the lime in the coconut, and call me in the morning  Yeah, it's been one of those nights.  Frig all happening and uninspired to do anything.  It was the same thing last night; I was in one of those lazy moods.  The highlight of my evening yesterday was cleaning the used A/C I bought from Dan and then doing a massive cleanup of my place.  Not that it was a mess or anything, i'm just a neat freak ever since I started dating Jen.  Who would of thought i'd ever get fun from doing dishes, vacuuming and cleaning the washroom.  I should go to Home Depot tonight and get the plexi glass to at least get the bedroom setup.  I've got a master plan to install this thing.  Even got a cool ass sketch of it.  I don't want it to look ghetto, we live in a really nice condo building.  The chick next door is ODD.  Not that i'm nosy but when you walk by outside all you can see in the patio window is PLANTS; that girl obviously likes her ivy.  We're talking tropical rainforest looking.  Oh yeah! and they've got this HUGE aquarium that looks cool but it's just overkill for the place.  It's like the Jungle meets Finding Nemo.  I'll never forget one of the days Jen and I were moving in.  We were in the hall and the girl next door was moaning and screaming PORNO STYLE.  Jesus, I thought Jen was loud, HAHA!!! It's never happened ever since so I guess her boyfriend must have hit a special spot that day.  Maybe I should go give him some pointers to hit the special spot each time ;)  Better weather today from the looks of things outside right now.  I was really tired earlier but i'm ok now which isn't good because I want to be out like a light right away when I go home.  I tried to watch Van Helsing again at work but wasn't able to get through it.  The movie doesn't suck or anything but i'm glad I didn't go see it at the theatre.  Seriously people, wait for the DVD.  Sunburn update... It's still there a little.  Now it itches like a sonovabich and i'm starting to peel.  I've never burnt like this before and i'm not liking it.  That bed must have had nuclear lights in it or something.  I was planning on going tanning tomorrow at the latest but now Saturday is looking like the earliest.  Oh yeah, note to self, call brother about Saturday.  Jen switched shifts and is working this Saturday so i'm gonna be all by my lonesome.  Not that it matters because Saturday is another night race and Jen isn't interested in NASCAR.  Neither is my brother but he tolerates it a little.  He likes playing it on XBOX with me anyways.  Ok enough blabbing, i'm gonna get started on Chapter 2 of my IID course.  Gotta stay on top of it because the courses this semester are laddered; another starts in June and 2 more in July.

      Well f*ck me in the goat ass.  It's raining like a mofo right now; thunder and lightning and I didn't bring a jacket.  I don't live far away but the hill on the way home is atleast a 30 degree incline so if I run down it i'm likely to go ass over tea kettle and being wet will be the least of my worries.  I got cracking on my Issues In Diversity course and it turns out it's completely not a popcorn course.  This is gonna take some serious work.  Oh well, I like a challenge.  I got Chapter 1 done and my discussion posted before anyone else so I can look like an eager beaver errrrrr beaver eater? HA!  Hope it's not raining when I go pick up Makayla; i'll have to walk instead of taking my bike.  My sister lent me this kickass trailer that hooks on the bike and it seats two kids.  It's completely enclosed but I ain't biking in typhoon winds like they're calling for.  It's only like a 10 minute walk so i'll bite the bullet.  Frig, I knew I should have given my Columbia jacket shell another coat of waterproofing.  Godamn procrastination. I'm getting quite the light show right now.  I have a view of the Parliament from work so it makes for an interesting scene with the lightning.  Right now it's mellow time with Winamp.  I'm listening to classical music; helps me think.  Mozart - Sonata for violin and piano, in B flat major; pretty kickass.  Being a musician, I listen to ANYTHING.  From DMB, to country, to NIN, to classical.  All music fits in a certain part of your day or a situation.  When i'm pissed, I might throw on some NIN; DMB is my happy time music.  Eric told me this hilarious joke earlier about how to wink and smile at a (insert race of choice here).  I shy away from racist jokes usually but this was just too funny not to laugh at.  I'll have to remember it and tell my brother on the weekend if he comes to visit; he'll piss himself laughing.  My little brother's cool.  He's 23 but I still call him my little brother.  Me and him should go do the Boondock Saints thing and take a bite out of crime in Ottawa. LOL!  Come to think of it, damn that movie kicked ass.

      Holy F*CK am I ever tired.  It's only 1am and I have 7 hours to go.  I'm a cranky bitch right now and a document i'm trying to access for my course is crazy ass slow.  The fact that i'm using the shitiest computer in the office doesn't help; this thing is ancient.  I'm gonna go for a drive to Tim Horton's and hopefully that will calm me down and the cafeine will wake me up.  Eric lent me Van Helsing to watch.  These computer geeks never cease to amaze me.  They get movies like the day after they come out in theatres.  I know it's wrong but i'll just do an extra good deed tomorrow to make up for it.

      Well, we ended up getting there at 7pm and they were putting away all the stuff for kids so that sucked.  There was a band playing that was pretty good.  The singer sounded a hell of a lot like the guy from the Barstool Prophets and it turns out it was him; guess he's got a new band going.  We didn't stay very long which kind of sucks because it was 10$ a piece to get in.  My sister is stressing me out.  While she was on maternity leave over a year ago and Employment Insurance was covering the rest of her salary that the company didn't, she kept collecting EI when she went back to work for a little while.  Jesus Christ, what a moron.  Of course they did an audit and found out.  Now she has to pay it back and she was fined 3700$ or something.  Way to go Nat *clap* *clap* *clap*.  My sister yet again shows me how irresponsible she is.  3700$ is a shitload of money to a single mother.  I guess she'll go crying to my dad again and he'll gladly whip out the checkbook to show everybody how much money he has.  I've NEVER had to ask my dad for money and I'd go flip burgers before I ever did.  Now, on the bright side, my sunburn is almost gone.  Hopefully i'll be able to go tanning on Wednesday.  I finally got access to my Issues In Diversity course.  It looks like a popcorn course with a lot of reading.  I got my Communications 1 grade; 93% A+.  Pretty hilarious concidering I barely put any effort into it.  I wrote an essay worth 30% of my grade the night before and got 27/30.  I want to get my grade back from my Criminal & Civil Law course.  I had 49/50 going into the exam (worth 50%) and I think I did pretty well on the exam although I blanked on the Tenant/Landlord contract section.  Hopefully it works out to an A+ and keeps my GPA at 4.0 :)  On that note, I should do some reading.  Although this course looks easy, it looks interesting.  Having knowledge of other cultures and religions will definately be useful in my policing carreer.

      Holy Christ am I ever bored at work.  I'm in a good mood but just uninspired to do anything right now.  I could be working on my Issues In Diversity course but the crackpots at Algonquin don't seem to have sent my login info to Embanet.  On that note, it's scary how much this program is going to cost me to do online versus going to the college; 7146$ in tuition plus almost 2000$ in books.  I did the math and it ends up being almost double what it would cost me to study on campus but that's life.  There's no way i'm quiting my job to study.  I make 43000$ a year right now and I won't make that until at least 2 or 3 years of service as a police officer.  I'm listening to retro 80s radio right now.  The intro to Prince's "Let's Go Crazy" really sucks.  The song is catchy though.  The 80s were great no matter what anybody says.  Music was actually diverse.  It's so bad now days you can't tell the bands and singers apart.  I should go home and get Jen's car to pick up that air conditionner Dan is bringing for me this morning.  God I miss driving my Monte Carlo.  We only have one parking spot at the condo we moved into in January. Jen needs her car to get to work and it's only literaly a 3 minute walk to the office for me.  That said, the Monte Carlo is being stored for now.  Looks like it's going to be a nice day today; 22 and sunny with some clouds.  Guess i'll be taking my niece to the park after I pick her up at the babysitter's today.  My sister's a single parent and can't pick up my niece by 5pm so I go get her.  It's not far from my place and I love spending time with my niece.  The only downside is that I finish work at 8am and only have until 4pm to sleep so some days i'm lacking sleep. I drove by the tulip festival on Friday and it looks like they've got some really fun stuff for kids to do at Major's Hill Park so maybe we could do that tomorrow.  I want to make sure she gets the most out of that stuff while she's young.  We grew up in the country and although it's a good place to grow up, it's definately not as fun as growing up in the city.  We didn't have Cosmic Adventures or anything like that :)  We went there the other week and I think I had more fun than my niece, HA!  I wonder if my brother had fun fly fishing with my dad on the weekend.  Those two constantly pick on each other but they're not fooling anybody, it's clear the love is strong.  My brother was always too young to realize how much my dad put the business before the family.  I grew resentful very early; at least my dad and I talk somewhat now.  Yeah I know, cue the violins.  Oh well, on the bright side, he was always there to throw around the money :/  Time to go pee and then get the car.  I'll check back in tonight and we'll see how the day went.  I got a good feeling it's gonna be a great one.

      I'm still sunburnt.  Guess i'll be cancelling tomorrow's appointment. Ended up sleeping until 2pm and was woken up by Jen coming home.  Was mad at myself because it was a beautiful day and I slept through half of it.  We decided to go get some groceries and we ended up getting stuck in massive traffic because of construction.  Gotta love Quebec.  Only in this retarded province will they be working on a Sunday.  Don't you end up going to hell for that?  To make matters worse, Quebec drivers are a bunch of idiots and just ended up making the traffic worse.  Needless to say we took another way home.  I'm gonna jam with Eric tonight at work; yeah, I know my job is kind of laid back and you don't want to know how much I make because you will hate me.  Well off to work I go to start another week and hopefully it passes quick.

      Yesterday, Jen and I went to see "Man On Fire"  Awesome movie!  Action for the guys and a tear jerker for the women.  I have a sunburn from tanning.  HOLY CRAP it hurts.  Not that I haven't burned before; it's just that it's been so long since I had gone tanning.  I slept on my stomach last night which I normally can't do.  I'm a sleep on my left side kind of guy.  I woke up to Jen rubbing aloe lotion on my butt which needless to say isn't the most normal way for a guy to wake up.  Didn't do much today.  Jen is gone to a cottage for the day and she'll be back tomorrow.  Just went for a walk and watched the race tonight.  Dale Jr won, OH YEAH!     I can't stop playing this game my brother lent me; Voodoo Vince.  It's hilarious.  I feel like a 7 yr old kid but i'll always be young at heart anyways.  I was supposed to finish writting two songs today but with all that's happened in the past couple of days with a friend of mine having trouble with a girl, it wouldn't have gone well.  The two songs have a really upbeat feeling and if I would have forced it today the lyrics would have surely been about a guy trying to get rid of a girl.  Once my head is cleared a little the music will hopefully inspire me correctly.  Well that's enough for now, time to play some Voodoo Vince and then hit the hay.  Hopefully tomorrow will be a nice day for a bike ride along the river.

      Well it's payday and i'm almost done my shift.  I have to go register for some courses at Algonquin today.  I'm taking all my courses online which is pretty tough.  No teacher at my immediate disposal.  I'm going to go to IKEA and browse for stuff I don't need :)

      This looks like fun.  I saw blogger mentionned when I was reading about google's stock that is soon to be released.  I tried writting a journal a couple of times but it takes too long to write; much faster to type.  If for any reason somebody stumbles upon this then enjoy my life :)

      Well, well, well.  This morning I get to wake up in a country led by a minority Liberal government because it appears a substantial amount of my fellow Canadians are ABSOLUTE F#$@ING JACKASSES!!!!!!!!  For the love of Jesus Christ himself people...  Have you lost your f#*&ing minds!?!?!?!  You see this proves something about most Canadians... We will bitch about something, say we'll do something about it but when it comes time to act, we make excuses.  All talk no action! Proves something about the polls too.  Must be that the only reason the Liberals and Conservatives were in a tie in the polls is because the people who said they'd vote Conservative were the 'deadbeat' voters.  Mad as hell at a scandal they didn't understand and probably had no intention of voting all the long.  So now for another four years we get play Russian roulette with a government that is going to create more scandal, uncertainty and broken promises.  I shit you not, we will look back on this as the biggest F#$@ UP Canadian citizens have brought upon themselves when they had full control to avert it.  Now here's a grim reality.... Our only hope is that Paul Martin had the fear of God put into him by thinking he was going bye bye.  Maybe he'll realize that he's been given a second chance and that he better not blow it.  My final statement on this... What is it they say about a leopard and its spots???? Ummmm yeah!

      Road race yesterday was in fact a little entertaining but i'm looking forward to the Pepsi 400 this coming weekend.  Back to oval racing.  Despite what people say, cars that go around in circles is in fact very exciting if you're not narrow minded.  Ever notice how people knock something down that they know nothing about?  If you stand back and take notice you will see that it can touch many subjects in life. Well, it's official.  I've got a godamn cold on my vacation.  What are the odds?  It's not a really bad one thankfully.  I went to Shoppers Drugmart yesterday (sorry, no PP Leslie) and loaded up on 35$ of ammunition.  Tylenol Cold daytime/nightime, Neo Citran, Benylin, Vicks, and Halls.  Take that you f*#@ing cold.  I usually take Buckley's but there are phases where I can't keep it down and it makes me gag and that's what happened when I tried to take it yesterday.   I slept like a friggin log last night.  With all the meds, no wonder!  Jen's still sleeping cause she was pooped from her lack of sleep Saturday night.  While she's sleeping, I think it's a good time to go vote.  Nice and early and beat the rush.  Jen won't vote anyways because she's a little shit and doesn't care for politics.   Time to jump in the shower and scrub this Vicks off me.  JESUS, I stink!

      But wait!!! I don't have to go to work tonight at midnight because I'M ON VACATION :)  My niece slept over again last night.  Much better this time.  She only tried to hop in bed with us once at about 2am and when she passed out after 5 minutes, I put her in her own bed.  I slept ok but poor Jen had to get up at 5am to go to work.  I think she's gonna hate her new shifts really quick.  Her only motivation for getting up at 5am was probably that when she gets home in a bit, she'll be on vacation like myself for 10 days.  We don't get to spend any time at all together during the week because we're on different shifts so this should be a fun week.  The race is about to start; road course race this weekend.  Not fond of road course NASCAR races but they can get entertaining at times.  I'm gonna grab some lunch and see where this thing goes.  Jimmie Johnson needs to get run off the road early ;)

      So today I started my vacation.  I was woken up this afternoon by Jen telling me that the director of our company called and wanted me to call him ASAP.  First reaction... Oh shit, what did I do.  I called him and oddly, my manager answered and they wanted me to come in to the office.  I go there expecting the worse but boy was I wrong.  As of July 11th i'll no longer be a contract employee!  Along with part of my team, I've been offered a permanent position with Bell IMS!!!  Holy f***ing shit batman!!!  Talk about starting vacation on a good note!  I'm anxious to get back to work now even though i'll be sure to make the most of my vacation.  I feel rejuvinated, for a long time now i've been at the end of the pay scale but now the sky's the limit.  Should be interesting to go back to work in two weeks and experience the jealousy of people on my team who didn't get the same offers.

      The topic was serious, the negotiations intense; neither party would budge on the issue.  What was it?.... Potty training.  We're trying to get my niece out of diapers and since I watch her almost everyday, a large amount of the potty training burden has been placed on uncle Rick.  I thought it was a fair deal; she does the deed and I give her a bowl of ice cream.  This kid was making DEMANDS.  After 15 minutes of sitting on the throne, not only did this kid get ice cream, she got gum, a book, a barbie and a gummy worm.  And in the end I got screwed in the whole deal.  She dumped half the "load" in the potty and 30 minutes later the other half in her pull-ups.  BRAT! Hopefully persistence is key.  I've just got this nightmare that she'll still be in diapers at the age of 4 and it will be blamed on me :(  Two more days until vacation, and with all the stuff going on at work MAN IS IT GOOD TIMING.  I thought I was starting a cold but it seems to be going away.  I went jogging tonight to "sweat it out" and it seems to have worked.  I'll have to keep my fingers crossed.  The life cycle of a cold is 10 days and that's how long my vacation lasts for :P  I'm watching the movie "The Bachelor".  Not the show, the movie with Chris O'Donnell.  It's really funny, I thought it was just some sap story so I never bothered to watch it before.  Not that I don't like sappy movies but this one seemed lame.  Oh well, just goes to show you "don't jugde a book by its cover".  Oh look at the time! Gotta jump in the shower!  POOF, gone

      Another week begins.  This one is special though because on Friday i'll officialy be on holidays for a week.  This is the first time in almost 5 years of working for Bell that i've managed to take holidays :P Don't have much planned for the week but that's ok because I just want to relax and Canada Day festivities will certainly take care of things.  Most important, i've got my Bela Fleck tickets for the Jazz Festival on July 2nd.  That show is gonna be awesome!  Listening to those guys really humbles you as a musician.  So, the weekend was fun.  We went to my parents' place on Saturday for father's day.  I didn't realize how spoiled my niece was until then.  She played in her pool, rode her pony, and then finaly went ripping around the backyard with my dad and brother on the four wheelers.  What did we have at grandpa's when we were young??? A pontoon boat that did a whole 20 km/h HAHAHA!!!!  My sister is on a new shift at work (godamn shift work!!!) so every second weekend we'll be watching my niece on Sundays which means Saturday night sleepovers.  This past Saturday was the first; what an experience.  We have a HUGE bed so we stuck Makayla between us.  OH MY GOD does that kid ever move around.  I was just starting to fall asleep when I felt something cold on my ear... her foot!!! She kept whacking Jen in the head while moving around so by the time everybody fell asleep, Jen had gotten fed up and decided to sleep with her feet facing the headboard.  I stayed the way I was and Makayla was lying sideways.  Needless to say, yesterday we got the kid her own bed!  I just wonder how she's gonna be with sleeping alone in the other room.  I don't doubt at all that the bed will need to be in our room.  Oh well, whatever keeps the kid happy and let's us SLEEP!  Makayla slept very well unlike Jen and I.  We went to Jen's sister's place with Makayla yesterday and she had a blast.  Trampoline, sandbox, swings and a pool.  Jen has a 4 yr old nephew so they played together.  Quite a language barrier but my niece speaks a little french but Jen's nephew seriously needs to start on his english.   Uncle dumbass here forgot to put on sunscreen so my nose looks like a beacon and my forearms are toasted.  Usually by now i'm so tanned from tanning beds that I laugh in the face of the sun.  I'll have to go on Friday and get rid of this farmer's tan.  Well, I got tons of reading to do so that's it that's all for now

      Good God, what a past couple of days.  Work is crazy busy, I had tons of work to do for my IID class this week and i'm seriously lacking sleep.  Today I can finaly SLEEP!  I swear i'm gonna be knocked out for 14 hours if I can.  So the other night I watched the 2004 Debate.  One thing REALLY stood out...  How the hell can Paul Martin be asked a question and then go off on a tangent, completely dodging the issue and think that he's in any way showing credibility or integrity.  I'm sorry but, Prime Minister Martin, you're just a complete SHITHEAD.  I had no idea how incompetent he was as a Prime Minister until I heard him talk for more than 30 seconds in any given news hour.  Jack Layton shot himself in the foot so much it probably fell off.  That guy is so arrogant and he sounds like he's been rehearsing his debate while he was tossing off in the shower.  On July 28th, don't vote for the best... Vote for the best of what's left; the Conservatives.  Sounds pretty sad EH!?

      I'm not racist, I have nothing againts foreign countries but when it comes to a product that is some form of a Canadian icon, I belive that it should be made at home.  Like I do every year, I bought this kickass hat at a store in the Rideau Centre to get ready for Canada Day.  It's a red flexseam hat with a nice big white maple leaf on the front.  I usualy check but the hat was so nice it slipped my mind;  I just checked the label... Made In Bangladesh.  WTF?!  Is this a big deal?  Well, yes and no.  I'm all for sending SOME business to other countries to help them out but save that for the VCR's, CD players, or any other 'made in Taiwan' product of your choice.  I'm one of those people that wears 'Canada' stuff all year round, not just for one day a year and don't even know what i'm celebrating.  I honestly do love my country.  Despite some bozos in government that are doing a good job of putting shit icing on a sweet tasting cake, things are actually pretty good.  When you live in the country that people all over the world want to leave their shit countries for, that's something to be proud of.  I can party with the best of them and God knows I can party crazier than most people in Ottawa but Canada Day isn't about going on the Byward Market and getting shitfaced.  You can drink to get a buzz on and have a good time.  Seems we all have a friend or friends that think everytime they drink they're not done until the're 3 times over the legal limit and embarrasing the shit out of us.  There's nothing worse than a 'bad drunk' and there are always several on the Hill on July 1st ruining it for some people.  Here's hoping people will know how to celebrate but more importantly WHAT we're celebrating on July 1st.  Just for the record, it's ok to wear a Canada t-shirt or hat any day of the year.  It's ok to have a sticker of the Canadian flag on your car too.  Nevermind the gay Honda/Acura/etc... stickers or anything else like that.  IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU LOOK COOL.  I used to have a Z24 with rims, sound system, DUMB STICKERS and the ONLY reason I did it was to get chicks.  If anybody tells you the reason they rice up their car isn't to get chicks they're FULL OF SHIT.  If anybody says "I don't do it for chicks, I have a girlfriend already", well I got bad news for them....  The only reason that girl is with you is because of your car!  Hey, the truth hurts some times.  P.S.  Putting TONS of NASCAR related stickers on your car is COMPLETELY COOL and deserves merit ;)

      You SUCK!!!  Jesus man, there's nothing better at Tim Horton's than a toasted bagel with herb & garlic cream cheese and sliced tomatoes in the middle.  The bagel was barely toasted and it's the second time I have to remind you to add the tomatoes.  It's not like there's a rush at 3am that causes you to get sidetracked and forget to add them.  Also, the next time I come, please have some godamn "everything" bagels or at least seasame.  That multi-grain bagel SUCKED ASS and since it was barely toasted it tasted even more like crap.  You look a little shifty so I hope if by some chance you read this (with my luck you will), please don't pull a bagel knife on me. On a higher note, I go to some Tim Horton's and the coffee is shit; "Always Fresh" my ass... BUT your coffee rocks all the time.  Just get the bagel thing sorted out and "we be cool G".

      Béla Fleck and the Flecktones are going to be at the Ottawa Jazz Fest on July 2nd!!!! If you've never heard of these guys, they are one of the most popular and talented jam bands in the world. They've toured a lot with the Dave Matthews Band.  Tickets are only 20$ too!  Go listen to some samples of their stuff and I guarantee you will be at that show like white on rice.  I recommend listening to "Stomping Grounds", "Earth Jam" and "Big Country".  Jazz is the roots of most music nowdays so everybody finds a way to take a liking to it.  Holy crap, i'm on holidays that week too.  Now THAT's a treat!

      Guess what I did yesterday morning...Something REALLY stupid.  When I went to Tim Horton's and came back to the office I parked the car out front because I didn't feel like going to bring it back home.  We live literaly right behind my office; it's only a 4 minute walk.  I got up from my desk at about 6am to go to the washroom and looked outside and saw the car.  I told myself "Oh yeah, I've got the car, almost forgot it there".  Well... I was really busy and had my mind on other things.  At 8am like I do every morning, I took the elevator and left out the back of the building and walked home.  Jen works at 2pm.  I was in a peaceful sleep when Jen came in at 1:30pm and woke me up and asked me in a panic where the car was.  Instantly the words out of my mouth were "AH F*CK!!!!".  I forgot the godamn car parked in the street in front of the office.  Poor Jen!  She had gone to the garage and oddly, no car.  She thought I may have parked it on the street in front of our place, but nope it wasn't there either.  When she found out where it was she started walking to go to get the car and one block away from our place it started PISSING rain.  So she was late for work, sopping wet, and to top it all off we, of course, got a parking ticket.  WOOPS!!!  In my own defense, there is SO MUCH stuff going on at work this week that i've had to set up 3 computers with macro software to automate some of my tasks that I call "robot work".  A computer can do it on its own, unsupervised.  I guess with all that, the car was the last thing on my mind.  Sort of ironic that when I noticed it at 6am, I found it comical I almost forgot it and then actually did.  For those of you who don't get the Bill Engvall "Here's Your Sign" thing, just go download it from your favorite bootleg software.  It's hilarious stuff.

      I swear, nothing can be normal in this office.  We have different 'climates' on this floor.  The complete opposite end of this floor is like the Antartic; so cold people on the overnight shift there wear sweatshirts to keep warm.  The center of the floor is like the middle of the U.S.A.; never too hot or too cold.  Now, at this time of day, my end of the floor is like the godamn deserts of the Middle East; HOT as flippin hell, mirages and hallucinations from the heat, and barely any air circulation. They shut off the A/C in this section overnight to save money or just drive me mad; who knows?  I can't wait to get home and SLEEP.  I've got the A/C CRANKED!!!  It was 16 degrees in there last night and I had fans going, so that's like 12 degrees with the windchill factor.  HAHA!!!  The moon looks like a big hazy blob right now because of the humidity outside.  I went to Tim Horton's a while ago and it was just nasty even though it was 3am.  So I put out the pool I bought for my niece yesterday.  That kid isn't impressed by anything unless i'm buying her a new Barbie.  She only stayed in for about 10 minutes.  She got in, splashed water in a 100 yard radius, and a couple of times freaked out because of insects floating in the water.  Some little shithead at the daycare apparently told her that spiders would bite her.  For some reason she associates any bug with being a spider now.  She's only 2 and 1/2 so I guess she doesn't know any better.  The first one was an ant and she wanted that thing out lickity split!  The next one was a moth and with the size of that thing she was practicaly shitting kittens.  It took forever to fill that pool too.  It's pretty big; inflatable and 6 feet accross.  Today we're staying in the A/C after I pick her up.  Kid can put her swimsuit on and go in the tub, no pool nonsense today! Speaking of pools, my dad went out and bought my niece one of those crazy ass Dolfino pools from Canadian Tire and put it up at his place.  The thing is 16 feet wide!  The kid can't even swim yet.  Sort of puts my 6 foot pool to shame.  That's my dad though, always gotta be outdoing people and flashing his money.  Some things will never change.  I say within 2 weeks one of the cats will jump up on that thing and make a hole in it.  Now THAT will be somthing to see.  Jen is going to Toronto for the weekend with her parents to visit her aunt so i'll be home alone.  Friday, I'll probably go up to my parents' place on the outskirts of the BIG town of Oxford Mills (just passed Kemptville).  I swear to God, my parents live in the middle of the middle of the middle of nowhere.  Don't get me wrong, it's nice and quiet, they have tons of land and a stable for our 6 horses, but there's NOTHING around.  It's even about a 15 minute drive into Kemptville.  Oh well, as long as they're happy out there.  I'll figure out what to do on Saturday when that day arrives.  I've got so much crap going on this week that if I think that far ahead i'm gonna f#$@ing traiwreck!  Perhaps i'll just pick up a pack of Strongbow and sit on my patio while I watch ODD people walk by.  Yeah, i'm cool.  Jesus, look at the time, better get back to my friggin reading.  I tell ya, i'm absolutely shit for brains right now and nothing is really being absorbed.  Time for another coffee!

      Have you ever had somebody piss you off and then as the day goes by you find out other stuff related to them that just keeps pissing you off more and more to the point where you snap?  Well it just so happens I work with a f*cking idiot just like that.  I came in to work and I puled out some stuff from my bag and I happened to take out my voter registration card with all the other papers.  Let me get one thing out of the way... I have nothing against french people since i'm 50% french and 50% english, no accent in either language.  So anyways, got the voter registration card out and this guy asks me what party i'm voting for.  I tell him i'm voting Conservative and this is what he says.  Sit down for this, it's good....  No really sit down.  He says "I won't vote for the Conservatives because they're against the french."  Because they're "against the french".  Well f*ck me, that's got to be the stupidest thing i've heard in about 3 weeks since I heard somebody say that the NDP doesn't spend lots of money.  What the f*ck is wrong with french Quebecers?!?!?!  There are many in my office and most of them have these crackpot ideas about the rest of the world.  Jesus H. Christ, There's a fine line between NORMAL people and the biggest f*cking idiots in Canada; that line is the Ottawa River.  If you're a Franco-Ontarian and you listen to people here in Quebec, it just pisses you off how people here think. So anyways, back to our f*cking bozo... So he makes that stupid statement and then because he's the 'laziest/stupidest/should have been fired a long time agoest' waste of space in this office, he makes my shift a complete nightmare because as usual everything is a godamn mystery.  I can't tell what happened, when it happened and we'll probably have 30 managers calling in about this asking who the godamn retard was who worked the shift before mine.  It was just one thing after another.  For the love of Saint Peter or any other bible hugger, did this guy do any actual work?!?!?!  You remember that Molson Canadian commercial that used to play on TV with the "infinite number of monkeys on an infinite number of typewriters....."?  Well one of those monkey's retarded siblings could do a better job that this guy. I don't like getting people in trouble at work but life is short and i'm here for a good time not a long time.  I'm tired of coming in and having to sort through his SHIT.  He can bend over and I'll shove a Quebec flag, a Pepsi and a Joe-Louis right up his poop chute while I sing him his favorite Roch Voisine tune.  Ok, i'm done with that.  As if Calgary lost the other night.  I knew something bad was gonna happen the second the puck dropped in that period.  I hope they win tonight; Disney land is real close.  Weekend went by pretty fast but it was a good one.  We bought this crazy ass huge air conditioner that can get nipples rock hard in about 15 seconds :) The two little ones just weren't cutting it.  I'll give the one we removed to my sister.  Looks like we got the big sucker just in time; forecast says 26 and really muggy.  I don't know what the hell is going on but it's raining HOT women in the street this morning;  I have a nice view from my desk.  Yeah, yeah, I know i'm not single but I can still look :P  On that note, i'm gonna enjoy the scenery.  ***No squirrels were harmed in the making of this blog post***

      Well, this has been an interesting shift.  They forgot to tell us they were going to be doing some work in our building and they had to ship us over to our downtown site for our shift so I had to experience some "last minute" crap which I really hate no matter the situation.  I had a blast at my sister's work BBQ last night and I was really tired.  I managed to catch a couple of Zs at work which helped cause I was nodding off pretty bad at 3am.  I'm just anxious for 8am so I can go crawl into bed and catch some much needed sleep.  There's really F*CK ALL going on right now so 8am won't likely come quickly.  I'll try and find something to keep me busy.

      F*ck me i'm tired.  Somewhere between 8am and 4pm I gotta go get my haircut, go tanning and squeeze in a couple of hours of sleep.  I'm going to a party for my sister's work with her and my niece tonight.  Not that I need to look good for anyone but Jen but i'm sure my sis will appreciate me being "presentable" and not just showing up in a Nascar t-shirt and some khaki shorts.  I ABSOLUTELY need to go buy the 3rd season of Trailer Park Boys today; i'm really hooked now.  Watched the 1st and 2nd seasons completely.  When I get Season 3 my buddy is going to copy 1 & 2 for me (he has a DVD burner!!) and in exchange i'll let him copy the 3rd season.  Hmmm, what can I bitch about briefly...? I hate people that whip out these "intellectual quotes" that they seem to try and pass as having anything to do with their lives or beliefs.  Like people at work that put quotes at the end of EVERY GODAMN EMAIL THEY SEND.  Quotes about hard work and integrity; these are the laziest c*cksuckers in the office!!!  You are bullshiters and not fooling anybody.  Now this next quote is a great one, to the point; bullshit free... "First they offered me forty and I told em to f*ck right off.  Gonna make 160 bucks... That'll buy a lot of f*cking cat food."  Bubbles - Trailer Park Boys

      Godamn it!  I overcooked my steak on the BBQ.  It's got to be medium rare at the most for me and because I got sidetracked, it ended up being WELL DONE.  On the bright side though, the shrimp were cooked to perfection. MmmmMmmmMmmm!!!  Top that all off with garlic bread with cheese on top toasted on the BBQ and that was one damn fine meal despite the beef incident.  I'm just finishing watching the second season of Trailer Park Boys.  It's not often a Canadian made show is good, this one goes to the extreme of being awesome.  They could have put this shit on FOX on Primetime, HAHA!  I ate too much, i'm so full.  There won't be any jogging tonight :P I go jogging on the path behind Parliament every night; nice scenery and not many idiots on bikes nearly killing me.

      OH MY GOD....  My buddy at work lent me the DVDs of Seasons 1 & 2 of Trailer Park Boys.  Apparently it plays on Showcase (the channel) and if you haven't seen it, it's a godamn riot.  I only watched 2 episodes so far and I laughed so hard I was crying.  Bubbles is the best character.  His glasses are so thick he might as well be wearing magnifying lenses.  Check blockbuster for it or go buy it, it's good if you need to laugh and I really needed to laugh this week.  Oh looky outside... More f*cking shit weather.  Imagine that.  SUMMER MY ASS.  I don't care if we get a maximum of 20 degrees during the whole summer, just KEEP THE GODAMN RAIN IN THE PRAIRIES WHERE THE WANT/NEED IT.    I just want the weekend to be here.  Not that anything exciting is planned; Jen wants to go see the new Harry Potter movie.  Oh f*ck me, I just remembered I have to finish some reading for my IID course.  Gotta cut this short again.  Until the next adventure.

      Can't think of a title.  Well, I seem to have fallen a little behind on my postings.  Woops. Weekend went by really fast.  In a nutshell, I just stayed around home, I asked Jen to trim a bush we have next to our patio and she pretty much choped half of it off.  It doesn't look so bad since we got flowers to plant in front of it.  The godamn bush was talking up half our patio so we didn't have much of a choice I guess.  The race Sunday night wasn't very eventful for me.  I didn't even catch the end.  Jr's lead is down to 5 points now.  Not that it really matters with the playoff system they implemented this year.  I have a funny feeling the true verdict on how drivers hate the new system will come out at the end.  We'll have an old system champion and a new system champion that will probably manage to pull a magic trick out of his ass in the last 10 races.  It's half past 5 right now and it's pissing rain.  Lovely first day of June :P  I'm gonna cut this short because i'm really uninspired right now.

      Some will understand what i'm talking about and have a good laugh, others won't know what i'm talking about...  My niece made me watch Chitty Chitty Bang Bang 3 times yesterday.&nbsp; I can't stop singing the theme song in my head and it's driving me nuts.&nbsp; Anything I think about comes back to friggin Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!  To make things worse, i'm trying to finish a Microsoft Access course for work and with that song in my head, it isn't going so well.   "...Oh you pretty Chitty Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang we love you........"  Ah #$%@ me!

      What happens when you start a term paper the same day it is due, put a whole 2 hours of work into it, COMPLETELY talk out of your ass to fill pages with cool words like "paradox" and "herein"?&nbsp; You get 80% on it! LOL!!! WTF??!!&nbsp; I feel guilty but at the same time I don't.&nbsp; I just want to get this course overwith; it's flippin' BORING.  You know what the sad part is about the education system?&nbsp; Only part of your grade depends on your knowledge.&nbsp; The rest depends on a teacher that ABSOLUTELY&nbsp;may grade based on generosity, mood, etc....

      I don't mean to sound all crazy and go off into "deep thoughts" territory but lately something really strange has been happening.&nbsp; I'm having these really BIZARRE dreams.&nbsp; Not that I don't have weird dreams... Like the one where i'm being chased by E.T. in the cars of a train and then the train ends up also transforming into his spaceship (yeah, I know :P).&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just that the dreams i've been having for the last couple of days don't seem like "my own".&nbsp; I forget which day I had the first one last week... Might have been Thursday, but it wasn't a normal dream, I was really "alert".&nbsp; Usually it's just flashes of stuff if you know what I mean but this was like a full fledged movie folding out in front of me; things&nbsp;were happening at a normal pace like reality.&nbsp; It sort of creeped me out.&nbsp; I can't even remember exactly what it was about but I know it had to do with sci-fi crap and outer space.&nbsp; Something about not being alowed to think certain stuff and these "people" knew when you were thinking it and would fry your brain.&nbsp; What I do remember well&nbsp;is waking up in a cold sweat, scared shitless.&nbsp; Usually I can remember dreams pretty well but this past weekend left me feeling uneasy because all that's left of the dreams a short while after I wake up is this same "eerie" feeling i've been having since that long ass dream.&nbsp; I just hope that crap stops this week because I really need to have a decent sleep today; EXHAUSTED. &nbsp; I'm feeling weird just talking about that so let's change the subject. Ummmmmmmmmmm. Summer is flying by WAY too fast.&nbsp; My god, it's the 19th already.&nbsp; Jen's b-day is on the 30th.&nbsp; I've stopped stressing over what to get her.&nbsp; No sense getting her something she doesn't want, i'll just suprise her on that day by taking her to Rideau Centre, give her 500$ and say "go nuts".&nbsp; I should get in touch with a couple of her friends of which I know phone numbers though and plan a dinner.&nbsp; I'll let one know and they can invite the rest.&nbsp; Oh yeah! Chantal.&nbsp; She can do it. &nbsp; I've managed to procrastinate YET AGAIN about an assignment that is due on Wednesday and will have to pull a magic trick out of my ass between now and then.&nbsp; It's a term paper so no biggy there.&nbsp; I just have to get my butt in gear and get it done.&nbsp; I didn't think it would happen but I have zero motivation to do schoolwork this summer.&nbsp; I knew, I should have just waited til the fall term.&nbsp; Ah whatever, I have a talent for producing under pressure. &nbsp; OH GOD, I almost forgot...&nbsp; My buddy&nbsp;does the overnight shifts on the weekend here and we do different stuff from the other shifts because of some of the processes we deal with.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's on vacation right now so somebody had to cover his shift on the weekend.&nbsp; Of course the worst person possible had to volounteer for it because she thought she'd be getting away from the stresses of the day shift.&nbsp; I'll refer to her as "princess".&nbsp; Let me tell you a little about&nbsp;her.&nbsp; Princess is the type that comes in the office in the morning, sits at her computer and has brie and grapes for breakfast.&nbsp; Yeah, one of those.&nbsp; The only reason&nbsp;she is working in our department is because somebody who's name shall go unmentioned as well hired her&nbsp;because he is&nbsp;going through a midlife crisis and thinking with his "one eyed Willy".&nbsp; This girl isn't even hot for christ sake and I have no idea why so many guys here think she is but I think I may know now.&nbsp; Take an office full of guys with the ratio of women to men being 1 to 50.&nbsp; About 75% percent of those guys are serious computer geeks and don't interact with females except at supermarket checkout lines and work.&nbsp; Introduce a girl that has mediocre looks and eventually she'll become a looker.&nbsp; Why?... Because it's the phenomenon of "the best of what's left".&nbsp; She's not hot but she certainly is the best of what's around here.&nbsp; Well actually, there's one girl that works in a department at the other end of the floor here and she's just rediculous hot but I have no idea who she is or what she does but probably got hired for the same reasons.&nbsp; She doesn't count though because she's not anywhere around us&nbsp; Anyhow, back to my original point.&nbsp; Daisy is A LITTLE SLOW when it comes to technology related stuff which is consequently 100% of the work we do.&nbsp; I sent her written instructions before the weekend for what she had to.&nbsp; Like, a 12 year old kid could have sat down, read it and managed.&nbsp; It was as simple as instructions for baking a cake.&nbsp; But no, princess Daisy sends me an e-mail saying she doesn't understand and would need to see examples of what i'm asking her to do.&nbsp; Good lord, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.&nbsp; This girl is the weakest link.&nbsp; I'm not saying she should be canned but she needs to be given different work and can be put to better use.&nbsp; All this to say that when I came in to work earlier, I had a mess waiting for me of biblical proportions.&nbsp; I'm gonna speak to my manager this morning and kindly ask that she NEVER touch my work again. &nbsp; I found out last week that contrary to what they told us, we don't get paid vacation until the end of our probation in January so if I want to take my other week that I booked in August, it will be unpaid.&nbsp; Crappy cause i'm not dying for the money or nothing but i'd like it for little extras I want and i'm wondering if I should save the time off for Christmas instead. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?&nbsp; If I was planning to go away during that time of course I would take it now but i'd just be loafing around the house.&nbsp; Jen booked the same time off too so i'm wondering how she'll react if I don't take it off.&nbsp; I'm also nervous about taking another week off after the mess I came back to last time.&nbsp; I think what I may do is take long weekends in August instead of taking all the time off at once.&nbsp; Leaves less room for having vacation spoiled by crappy weather and stuff.&nbsp; I better decide soon though, it's in three weeks.&nbsp; I heard that they're giving us one day off a month paid until December so maybe I can work something out with that too. &nbsp; Holy crap this is getting long!&nbsp; On that note i'm gonna go check on tickets for the Casino fireworks competition and finish my crap before going home.

      Let me tell you about my Saturday night.  We went to a party at Jen's friend's place in the middle of buttf$#@ nowhere in Buckingham.  It's about 20 minutes from Hull and likely has a population of 50% inbreds.  For some reason everybody was hellbent on getting me drunk because i'm playing guitar for them and providing the entertainment.  I was happy with the hotdogs.  You name the shooter, I had it;  You name the beer, I tried it.  So here I am absolutely shitfaced and for some odd reason able to play guitar quite effortlessly when a commotion breaks out.  The host, Chuck (great guy by the way), and his brother Louis were arguing.  Turns out Louis is diabetic, drinks like a fish, so when he's drunk he forgets to take his insulin or gets extremely moody about taking it.  I knew something was up because, 5 minutes prior, the guy was just talking nonsense.  So Louis takes off into the house to do an insulin test and he was 4 points off and says he's fine and flips out on everybody for bothering him.  Now for those of you who aren't familiar with diabetes, 4 points off is bad and needs attention.  He pushes his girlfriend aside and storms out of the house.  I talked to his girlfriend for a little who was in tears and calmed her down and then sprinted off after Louis because in less than 30 minutes, he was gonna be in trouble.  Here I am, drunk as hell, jogging through the streets of Buckingham with no godamn idea where i'm going or which direction Louis went in.  25 minutes later and by some miracle I ended up doing a circle around this huge neighborhood and ended back at the party.  Turns out this little shithead headed back to the house 5 minutes after he left while I was out running around looking for him with a 50 lb heart thinking I might be finding him unconscious somewhere.  Everybody had gone out looking for me because they assumed I was lost but they were looking totaly in the wrong places.  Needless to say, when I got back to the party I was mad as hell.  I TOLD Jen we were leaving and immediately parked my ass in the car.  Now after a night of heavy drinking and jogging for 25 minutes, what do you think little mr. tummy has to say about that.  PULL OVER NOW!  I puked so hard I think I heard animals talking back to me like they understood what I was saying.  I'm a cheap drunk even though i'm 6 feet tall and everything I drank was definately overkill.  It's gonna be a good while before I can drink anything other than Strongbow or Bud.  Jen sort of didn't say anything on the way home because she knew I wasn't too impressed about some of her friends.  The next day I asked her how old Louis was because he seriously looked like a 19 year old kid and that's why he stormed off immaturely.  I find out he's 29 years old and that just pissed me off even more.  Christ, everybody's gotta grow up sometime.  I hope that time has come for him.  People were calling on Sunday to ask if I was ok and saying that I should have just let him go off so he'd learn his lesson.  Jesus Christ people.  UM YEAH!?!?!  I'll make a great police officer if I my morals are to just let a drunk diabetic storm off and have an attack.  Learn HIS lesson?  When everybody's at the funeral I wonder who will be learning a lesson.  It's too bad that Jen has so many great friends that I like and just one that had to spoil the entire night.  Not bad for being completely hammered and still able to jog for 25 minutes straight though! LOL!! Should have said no to the excess alcohol though, i'm smarter than that and am sort of disappointed in myself.

      They say you begin to get old when you return to your childhood hobbies and take fun in things that are very simple but amuse the hell out of you.  Well, guilty as charged at the age of 26.  For the last couple of weeks i've been obsessivly building scale car models like I did when I was a kid.  We have this habbiscus tree (or whatever the hell it's called) on our patio in a pot so it can get some sun for the summer.  A couple of weeks ago I noticed a squirrel digging in the pot and despite my efforts at scaring him, he's getting braver by the day.  Now this ain't no ordinary squirrel.  The thing is almost the size of a cat and he's SMART.  Now he stays in the pot and taunts me.  I swear he hangs out in there until he sees me inside noticing him. The little shit knows he can outrun me and I won't be able to hurt him because now i'm up to the point where I can actualy open the patio door, walk out and get about 6 feet away from him before he takes off and climbs up his tree to hide.  Same thing happened this morning.  Me outside in my boxers and a t-shirt trying to pounce on a squirrel while my neighbors are probably watching me and laughing their asses off.  So hence the question of the day...  How do you teach a squirrel a lesson without hurting him in any way?  The stuff they sell to put in dirt to repel squirrels smells like ASS so that was out.  A statue of a cat or something?  No, it's too smart for that.  While browsing the isles of Canadian Tire, it suddenly appeared right in front of me and oh boy did the little hamster in my head ever kick it into high gear.  The answer to the question of how to teach a squirrel a lesson without hurting it is to nail the little f***er with jet of water coming from a Super Soaker EX 630.  Holds 3L of water, pump action and has a shoulder strap. So I go outside to test it and man it GOES!  I could probably nail a squirrel square in the head at a distance of 30 feet.  Here's the kicker... No sign of the squirrel in the past 2 hours since I tested the gun.  You be the judge of how smart this thing is.  BEWARE THE URBAN SQUIRREL.  I feel like Bill Murray in Caddyshack with the goffer and probably look just as dumb but i'm keeping myself occupied ;)  VIVA LA RESISTANCE!!!

      Now I know it's no secret that lemonade and 7-UP taste good together but my recipe is the BEST.  I spent all last week screwing around with it and found the perfect balance.  You need one of those "thingies" that you use to get the juice out of oranges.  Apparently it's called a juicer/reamer  You know, the thing that's shaped like a boobie and ribbed!  That just got your imaginations going eh? LOL!  You could just squeeze the lemons but you NEED THE PULP.  You need at least 8 medium sized lemons.  They're usualy 3 or 4 for 1$.  1.Cut one lemon in half at a time and start reaming lemons to get the juice and pulp out until you have 1 and 1/2 cups of lemon juice/pulp.  For me it's about 6 lemons but will depend on the size.  2.Pour the lemon juice/pulp in a large jug and add 1/2 cup of sugar and 5 cups of water.  3.Mix it real good and add 3 or 4 of the leftover lemon halves that you reamed.  4.Get a big glass and pour the lemonade in FIRST to fill the glass half way.  5.Fill the rest of the glass with 7-UP.    6.Drink it with a straw.  I don't know how to describe the difference between a straw and just sipping but it's way better.   I AM A CULINARY GENIOUS!   If anybody wants to experiment, add some alcohol to this and let me know how it tastes.  Vodka or Gin is kickass in this.  If anybody asks you what it's called, it is "Rick's Knock You On Your Ass Lemonade".  Without alcohol it's just "Rick's Kickass Lemonade".  ENJOY!!!!

      I might finaly have an explanation why my hands and feet are always frozen and I get head rushes when just doing nothing.  Someone I "know" went to a doctor and found out she may be anemic.  Is that fatal? LOL!  She's studying to be a nurse so hopefully she'll be able to shed some light on this.  The reason it bothers me is cause I get "tinny" head rushes while i'm driving about once or twice a year and that's not the right time to possibly faint!  The weekend is here and thank God.  I need to get away from work for a couple of days because people here are driving me nuts!  I should leave them soothers when I leave later so they have somehting to suck on instead of bitching.  Gonna take my buddy Mark out to lunch for his b-day this afternoon.  Go to the Keg on the market and get some big ass steaks.  Man i'm a good friend ;)  I went and saw Harry Potter on Wednesday with my sis.  Good movie, pretty scary.  There were some young kids in the theatre that were not happy campers at some parts.  We were gonna take my niece another time if it wasn't too scary but we'll be waiting for the DVD to come out.  She would shit kittens because the sound is so loud at the scary parts which is obviously to emphasize the effect.  So apparently we're going camping on Saturday night and i've been TOLD to bring my guitar.  Jen's friends are all VERY french so they better not be expecting any Quebec roots music because I only know two.  I guess i'll play some Dave Matthews of course, some Guster, John Mayer, Coldplay.  That's music everybody can enjoy, even the Frenglish.  Guster, now there's a band not many people have heard of.  There's so much great music out there people never get exposed to.  Readers, your music homework for today is to download the following songs (for evaluation purposes only of course):  1.  Guster - So Long 2.  Guster - Parachutes 3.  Angie Aparo - Spaceship  (Angie Aparo wrote the song "Cry" that people think Faith Hill wrote, it's HIS!!) 4.  Angie Aparo - Gravity   Listen to those for now, i'll get you guys some others in the future.   LATER PEEPS!!!

      Turns out some guy at the Flecktones show recorded the whole thing.  I remeber seeing this guy too.  He had some crazy ass setup with microphones.  If you want to hear what you missed on July 2nd, go here.........  http://www.archive.org/audio/etree-details-db.php?id=15848  Listen to all if you can but you MUST listen to Victor's solo.  I'm still in awe about that one.

      Friday night I went to see Bela Fleck & The Flecktones at the Jazz Festival.  Now I knew Victor Wooten was a crazy amazing bassist from seeing him on videos playing with the Dave Matthews Band as a special guest and from listening to CDs but last night I saw him live for the first time...  This guy is without a doubt the best bassist on the entire planet.  He is a musical genius and for a musician like me it is even hard to grasp the scope of what he does.  If playing bass was religion, Victor Wooten would be Jesus walking on water.  I've paid triple the price for a ticket to see bands that weren't even half as good as these guys.  You can listen to all the Bela Fleck CDs you want but until you see the band live, you ain't heard NOTHING yet.  I know i'm rambling but it was such a good show, I swear I almost jizzed in my pants when I heard Victor's solo.  Talk about a humbling experience.  I'm a very good bassist but I really know my place now.  So my vacation is hours away from being over.  I knew it would go by too fast but it's no biggy.  I had fun and I've got another week coming up in a month.  I'm curious to get back to work and see the mess that was left for me to sort out.  I wonder if Ben took care of things as well as I anticipated he would.  He's quite disgruntled lately so it's a crap shoot.  On a side note, Canada Day was really fun.  Due to the unpredictable weather that day, we decided to head up to my parents' place in Kemptville and celebrate with the family.  My dad bought 500$ worth of fireworks so it was worth the trip just to see if he'd come close to blowing himself up like last year.  Beware the duds, dad! LOL!!!  I went four wheeling with my brother, jesus that kid is nuts.  90 km/h on a four wheeler isn't the safest feeling in the world.  I did my best to follow him and not look like a wuss but that speed with nothing between you and the road but air isn't fun. I've got a really bad urge to go buy one now.  Jen rode one of them too so I think she's hoping I decide to.  We'll see, maybe next summer.

      Oh my god!  I just tried one of those new orange flavored milkshakes from McDonald's.  It's like having 6 creamsicles at once!  These are going to be hard to stay away from, especialy since there's a McDonald's about 200 yards from my place.  Funny story....  On Friday I had to go to Steve's Music on Rideau to pick up some new guitar strings.  Jen had the car and taking a bus from my place is a pain.  I decided to bike because it wouldn't take more than 15 minutes to get there.  As I was coming up to the Alexandria bridge (the steel grate one beside the museum of civilization) I was going at a pretty good clip coming up to the intersection.  As I got closer I realized that I had to jump an 8 inch high curb to get on the bike/walking path on the bridge.  "No problem" I think to myself, my bike has dual shocks in the front and back.  I don't know what the hell I was thinking.  So I end up trying to jump the curb coming at an angle.  The front tire cleared no problem but because of the angle the back tire caught the curb and threw the back end of the bike left.  I "gracefuly" skidded the bike through the bushes (without falling! I RULE) and about 20 people in the immediate vicinity had a pretty good laugh.  So I brush off my bruised ego and keep going.  Some drunk bum was sitting on the sidewalk and says to me, "F*ck dude, that was like a movie stunt" LOL!!! I burst out laughing because I realized it must have looked quite spectacular what with the speed I was going at.  The bad part is I COMPLETELY F*cked my back rim and i'll have to buy a new one.  The rest of the ride was quite interesting with that wobble in the rear :(  P.S.  Got my guitar strings though ;)
