      Hrm. I don't think it's okay that the left margin of my tongue is tingly.   It's a very interesting sensation when novocaine wears off. First, that area of your mouth which is about to feel normal again goes from annoying fat and bloated feeling to incredibly tense and vaguely painful. Then, slowly, normal sensation is restored - that is, your mouth feels your own again. Of course, this happens in various stages, so that first my tongue went back to normal, then the back of my jaw, and eventually my lip.  However, there is that part of my tongue which doesn't feel completely fine yet. Dammit, if there is nerve damage, I so am suing my dentist, no matter how much I like him. He should've filled these stinking cavities 6 months ago when he found them, instead of making me schedule a new appointment.  But! At least I can eat real food again. Mmm. Ode to a red velvet cake. And other yummy foodstuffs too.

      Errrgh. I hate going to the dentist. Especially when it involves getting two cavities filled, one on the right lower side and one on the left lower side. That's right. It means they have to numb up your ENTIRE lower jaw, thus causing your lower lip to feel grossly inflated and your tongue as though it's majorly constricted. And I swear the dentist hit an extra nerve on my left side - does the trigeminal nerve deal with sensory innervation? I think it might - because not only is my entire jaw numb, so is my left cheek, and they definitely weren't doing any work up there. And why does the numbness actually hurt? Shouldn't it feel like nothing? And why didn't I remember that it would be impossible for me to eat afterwards.. because obviously, in my brilliance, I did not eat before the procedure and there is this red velvet cake just sitting in the fridge, taunting me..  This is definitely worse than that time I had all 4 wisdom teeth taken out. They knocked me out, there was no residual pain, and I could eat properly and talk without sounding like I needed massive help. Plus, I got some valium out of the whole deal, in a shady transaction where the oral surgeon gave me some pills in a little envelope at the consult telling me to take them before coming in for the surgery. I didn't take them then, and saved the pills for when I was really stressed a couple of months later. See, all trips to the dentist should involve getting extra valium like that.

      So, what defines being an "LA person"?   I was trying to define to one of my sort-of-exes-now-really-just-an-annoying-as-hell-git what being an "LA person" is. He seemed to think it had something to do with being superficial and blond, and that he could attempt to be both things.   But as I see it, it's really not a learned thing, and you can't force yourself to be an "LA person." There's no set definition - you just radiate the vibe, that's it. It's a way of talking, a way of acting, a way of  being  that you can't really study, or really dissect. It doesn't matter if you're originally from here or not - I mean, stinkyhead is totally LA, even though he's originally from the Midwest. And then I have friends from high school who totally aren't LA, even though they're from here.   You know how it is. Some people just  are , some aren't.   I sound so hippie zen surfer dude(tte). Maybe I need sleep.

      Things I hate about flying: 1) People who take way too long at the checkin counter, who then give you dirty looks for waiting patiently behind them. 2) Ticket counter agents who make you take textbooks out of your 1 piece of checked luggage because it is 4 pounds over the wimpy 50-pound weight limit. Hello, my empty suitcase weighs at least 25 pounds on its own, I swear. 3) People who mill around the ticket counter while waiting to board the flight.. and then when their row is called, just cut in even though you've been waiting patiently for the past 15 minutes.  4) People who get in the boarding line even when their seat number hasn't been called, just so they can be at the head of the line when it's finally their turn, some 30 minutes later. 5) Flying in general. It's bad for the skin. And even in first class, it's so damn hard to get comfortable..  6) Parents who meet you and ask w/i five minutes if you have a drinking problem, because you have charged 6 bottles of wine to the credit card in the last 2 months. That is *not enough upon which to base alcoholism... and sigh, if they only knew the real amount of booze being consumed.  Things I like about flying: 1) Nice ticket counter agents who praise you on what they think is patience, although it is in reality silent fuming. And who let you stick your textbooks back into your checked luggage because 4 pounds is nothing. 2) Getting upgraded to 1st class even though when you called 2 months ago to attempt to upgrade, you were told that 1st class was full.  3) All the free booze in 1st class.  4) The extra leg room in 1st class, even though it's still hard to get comfortable.  5) Flying into LA at night. There's nothing like the sea of lights. You don't get it anywhere else.

      More examples of my brilliance:  Phone rings. Don't recognise the number. Answer anyway, because I don't believe in screening calls unless I am definitely trying to avoid someone. Me: Yes? Voice: Hello? Jennifer? Me: Yes?  Well obviously it's me, you called my cell phone.   Voice: It's Ashley..  Ashley? I don't know any Ashleys... ohhh, except for my 7-year-old cousin. But what in the world is she doing calling me? And why does she sound so mature? Where is her mother? Oh no, has something had happened to her mother? I love her mother, I hope nothing happened at home..  Voice continues, because there's been this long pause while I've been thinking all the above: You know, stinkyhead's sister..  And it all kicks in.  It's the boyfriend's sister, I had promised to give her a ride to the airport since she is a smart chicky and decided to go to college in Southern California. (Obviously, she didn't call him stinkyhead, but since that's how I'll be referring to him here until I can think of a more mature nickname, that's how you all will know him by.) But since I hadn't been expecting her call.. ahh, yeah, it's not that funny, is it, but it was.. at the time...  Leaving in 13 hours, and still have not commenced packing nor cleaning my apartment yet. Bleh. I hate packing and cleaning.  This is why I need servants. Then they can do it all for me. I don't know why I hate packing so much, I like travelling, and it's an evil necessity.. but, there's just something so...  blech .. about it all..

      Conversation with mother last night:  Mom: "We are having people over for Thanksgiving." What goes through my mind:  People. What people? Surely not family, if she's saying 'people.' Is it possible that my parents have made friends since my sister has left for college, leaving them with nobody at home but the dog, who my father loves more than the rest of us anyway?   What I say: "What people?" Mom: "You know, people." My thoughts:  Oh my, maybe they have made friends, or have adopted new kids in our absence without telling us. But be specific!  Me: "So, who are these people?" Mom: "Oh, you know, Grandma, all the aunts, etcetc.."  Okay, in retrospect, that wasn't that interesting. But it was just so confusing at the time. Not to mention, every Thanksgiving, we have our whole extended family over, so this is nothing new. Who knows why she was trying to make this exciting or mysterious..  And I was so excited for a new baby sister..   And I am indeed a lazy turd. Ever since I gleefully cleaned my cupboards and gave away all my canned food which had been stashed there in case of a nuclear attack (I mean, seriously, I could have survived at least 3 weeks in my apartment with all the dried and canned stuff I had)... I haven't had anything to eat for lunch. Obviously, I am too lazy to actually leave my apartment and bring something back, because that would take effort. So I've had lots of clementines and crackers and peanut butter (the good, grind-it-yourself-kind-by-pushing-a-button-on-the-machine-in-Whole-Foods) before my afternoon classes. It's gotta be good for me, somehow. But, it's not quite enough nourishment to have me fully alert for whatever fascinating lecture is in store. At least yesterday was psych, where the professor just shows movie clips to illustrate different kinds of psychiatric disorders.. although he did start to lose me when he over-extrapolated and said that Clint Eastwood characters generally suffer from schizoid personality, that is, they are virtually incapable of being warm and are anxious when others try to be close to them. It was a little too much for me. So then I started figuring out what personality disorders I had, and have deemed myself schizotypal - having odd and eccentric ideas that indluence daily life - with a dash of borderline - at least, the impulsive behaviour part of borderline - and histrionic - dramatic, attention-seeking. Throw in a touch of avoidant - hypersensitive to criticism - and that might be me. (And I am demonstrating quite brilliantly how *not to diagnose psych disorders, as I'm picking and choosing only applicable characteristics from each one, but oh well, it was fun.) And we (okay, really, just my friends and I) have determined that personality disorders aren't really disorders most of the time, but rather medical terms for making fun of people. Sometimes, it's the little things that bring joy to one's day.

      I want a hot dog for lunch, but don't want to have to leave my apartment before class to get it and bring it back here to eat, and I don't want to eat it in the Biomed building. I wonder if I can call someone who's in class right now and get him/her to bring me a hot dog for lunch during the lunch break. Probably not. Dammit. Maybe I'll say I'm suffering from a massive protein deficiency even though I had foie gras for dinner Sunday. But that doesn't count.

      In four days, at this time, I will be home. I am sooo excited, you have no idea. Hopefully, LA will be as lovely as ever, nice and sunny, and I can shed these stinking wool coats for at least a week. Knock on wood. (That's right. A nice full week of Thanksgiving vacation, mainly because I'm skipping classes I don't attend anyway.) Of course, with my luck, it'll be dreary and cloudy - but oh, a girl can dream!   I'm actually more excited than I know I'll be once I get there. Then I have to deal with family - why don't I have a backup prescription of Valium I can take for these instances? - and pressures to stay in med school and questions about my dating life and why in the world are you giving up the profitable world of medicine to become an academic? Ahhhh. Where is the Valium right now?   Also, Christmas shopping is stressing me out more than it should. I know it's not even Thanksgiving yet. But what am I supposed to do when Bed, Bath and Beyond started blasting Christmas music The Day After Halloween and all the ads on TV and inserts in magazines are about presents? I do things best under pressure. Maybe I should wait until December 23rd to buy everything. Or - my personal favourite - give presents on New Year's instead of Christmas so that I can take advantage of all the post-Christmas sales.

      Best way to spend one's weekend? Doing nothing related to school, catching up with friends and eating really well also. And watching lots of great cheesy movies starring Hugh Grant.  About a Boy  Saturday night,  Love, Actually  Sunday afternoon. I had to wait too long to see the latter - it opened last weekend, I was super-excited because I had convinced stinkyhead that we *had to see it. ("You only want to see it because Hugh Grant is in it." "So? Oh yeah, Keira Knightley is in it too." "Okay, let's go see it." "You're a dirty old man, she's younger than your sister." "No she's not. She's at least 25." "Yes she is, she's younger than your sister." "Don't say such things!" "Hah! Anyway, Hugh Grant is really cute." "He's 20 years older than you are." "So what? We have the same birthday. It's meant to be. We can be like Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas, except he's way cuter than Douglas." "He's still old enough to be your dad." "And Keira Knightley's your sister's age.") Okay. It didn't take that much convincing. But boy, was I mad when I was visiting him last weekend, and It Wasn't Playing In The Stupid City He Lives In. That's what happens when you cross the Mason-Dixon line, grr. Godforsaken South. Nothing is right down there. And somehow, I couldn't convince him to drive an hour and a half to the nearest city that *was actually showing it.  So finally, I got to see it this weekend. Oh, I shouldn't be allowed to watch romantic comedies anymore, because then I get all mopey and depressed afterwards, and am convinced that I am never going to find true love like they always do in those kinds of movies. Especially true love with Hugh Grant, or that hot Brazilian guy, Rodrigo Santoro. Or both of them. I'd even settle for Colin Firth, although he is a touch too stuffy for me. (My favourite line in the movie? "Let's get our asses kicked by love.") It gets so depressing. So afterwards, my friend and I had a glass (or two, or three) of wine to make up for it.  I also miss the days when people could meet you at the gates at the airport, instead of waiting in baggage claim like cattle. It's not quite the same. Now, the only expectant looks you see at the gates are those people wanting you to hurry the hell off the plane so it can be cleaned so they can board. Then you have to trudge your lonely self all the way through many hallways before finally, you meet up with the people waiting for you.   Why am I being so mopey and sentimental? This is so unlike me. It doesn't help when the girls you hang out with Saturday afternoon are only capable of talking about their boyfriends. Hello! There's so much other stuff to talk about, like clothes, and celebrity gossip, and how the weather needs to be better. (Huh, looking back at my entries, I sort of seem like one of those girls who can only talk about her boyfriend too. Who knows what's wrong with me. It's probably because I'd just come from visiting him.) Also need to take the sappy movies out of the VCR and stick in something like... huh, apparently 95% of the videos I can be labelled romantic comedy, or have a romantic element to them (yes, even  Ocean's Eleven . He does it all for Tess, doesn't he.) Okay, fine.  Charlie's Angels  it is.

      I'm very excited. Yes, I picked up  It Must've Been Something I Ate , by Jeffrey Steingarten, yesterday, and now can't put it down. Good thing I don't have any more exams 'til after Thanksgiving, because this book isn't leaving my side until I'm done with it. Hm, that might be a little awkward in public, but oh well. For those of you who like to read about food, oh, he's your guy - because he loves food. Adores. A real gourmand. Everything he writes is so well-researched, I'm just incredibly impressed. He'll take a very scientific and methodological approach to... everything. What makes the perfect cup of espresso. Taste-testing ketchups. What the chemical composition of a perfect glass of water is. How to make the perfect french fry. And he's funny! I can't moon over him enough. An excerpt from the book:   And then there's Pica's disease, in which patients display a "morbid craving for unusual or unsuitable food, such as the ingestion of ice, clay, laundry starch, lettuce, or cigarette ashes." Even in the midst of an impending personal tragedy, I was gladdened to find, at last, hard scientific evidence that lettuce is an unsuitable food and that a craving for lettuce is evidence of a diseased brain."  His personal tragedy, in this instance, is the possibility that his interest in good food is actually called by a lesion in the anterior portion of the right cerebral hemisphere. So, of course, he gets in touch with the Swiss scientists who published this discovery, to find out if he is suffering from such an affliction. Another excerpt, this one from his first book,  The Man who Ate Everything .   Last night I played the neatest trick on my wife. I grilled a slice of my best homemade French country bread, spread it thick with Promise Ultra Fat-Free nonfat margarine, set it on the coutner, sat back, and waited. Soon the toasty aroma drew my wife into the kitchen. Seeing the bread, she smiled broadly and took a bite. I'll never forget the way her smile froze, as she gagged, stumbled over to the kitchen sink, and gave up her mouthful of break covered with Promise Ultra Fat-Free nonfat margarine. What fun we have together!  How can you not like him? And he used to be a lawyer! Maybe there is hope for my boyfriend. Hahaha. While stinkyhead appreciates good food, he relies upon me to find it. (And then he talks about our varied dining experiences - for instance, the Minibar at Cafe Atlantico in DC, wow, was that amazing - at his interviews, and everyone is properly impressed and wants to eat there straightaway. Harumph. I claim at least 25% of his future salary, since obviously I will have had a big hand in helping him secure whatever job he eventually takes.) He will never be the type of guy who flies to France to meet with some famed French chef to learn how to make the perfect omelette, and then spend the next 2 weeks attempting to recreate it. It's okay. There can't be two of us in a relationship. If he became as obsessed with food as I am, then having to debate which restaurant to go to every time we have dinner.. no, no. That's *my role. *I get to choose where we eat.   For more Steingarten, he writes for  Vogue . That's right. A seemingly brainless woman's fashion magazine carries one of the greatest food writers ever. It's worth buying the magazine just for him. Plus, I love looking at clothes.    On a tangent... nothing is more fun than driving. I love driving. Not driving in traffic - but that's a necessary evil, as I come from LA, and have learned how to entertain myself in the car in those situation. That's what cell phones are for. And sunglasses so you can unobstrusively check out other drivers. Personal theory #235: Drivers are cuter the closer you get to the beach. This is based on years of "research." But driving along a nice stretch of open highway, when the leaves are changing colours - or even if all the leaves are dead on the ground because it's so freaking cold, but it's brilliantly sunny outside - there's nothing quite like it.

      Yay! The weekend is here! Although, I don't really do a whole lot on weekdays, so there's no difference. My days are just a blur of massive procrastination. It takes real work, you know. If I could find a job where all I'd have to do would be to waste time, I'd be damn good at it. And I'm good at convincing people that whatever tasks they have to do are really worthless, to get them to join me in my wasting of time.   Awhile back, I did a handwriting analysis, using this very handy website which I'd link to, but I forget what it was called. In essence, you write a paragraph down, and then compare it to samples on the website, clicking on similar characteristics (ie, are your 'I's bigger than other letters in your sentence? Do you cross your 't's? Where do you cross them? What kind of cross is it? etcetc). And part of my analysis was this:  Interesting... You checked that your writing has "noticeable, pointy-like hooks in the lower case letters c, d, or a. This "stinger" indicates a love-hate relationship with strong members of the opposite sex.   It's funny, even though you have a compelling attraction towards these strong individuals, you often create little challenges throughout the relationship to test their strength. In dating, you love the chase, but often get bored once you capture your prey.  How true that is. Scarily true. Here I am, I've been in this relationship for .. oh my, approaching a year and a half (which is an eternity for me, usually it was 2 weeks, you're out.. or, we'd never actually  date , per se, but rather just hook up for several years - non-exclusively, of course), and I'm still acting as if we had just gotten together.   Why hasn't he called me yet?  Why hasn't he sent a response to my email in two entire days? I'm not calling him, I'm waiting for him to call me first. He'll call me when he wants to talk to me. We'll see who can hold out longer.  The funny thing is that this "power struggle" (or game playing, depending on who you talk to) is all entirely in my head. I'm sure stinkyhead (which is how I affectionately refer to him behind his back.. either that, or stupidhead, or crankypants, because I am *that mature) has no idea that this is going on, and is acting like the oblivious male that he is. We talk, about 2-3 times a week, which is quite enough for me because nothing exciting ever really happens to me, and I don't think I could listen to him talk about how much reading he has to do for law school every day.   But he's always been much more secure in the relationship than I've been. He started calling me his girlfriend about a month after we started dating.. and I just freaked out - behind his back, of course. It took me another eight months before I would refer to him as my boyfriend to anyone. He was just always, "the guy I'm dating," "the guy I'm currently seeing," "the guy I fly to visit" (since our relationship yes, is long-distance.). And I am absolutely convinced that some day, he'll run off with his trampy blonde paralegal, like Joe sort of did to Sally on  When Harry Met Sally . (I should stop applying that movie, and also  Sex and the City  to my life. It's not very healthy. )  And he's been nothing but great to me. We've only really had two arguments, and generally get along marvelously. We have just enough of the same interests to be compatible, but aren't exact clones so it doesn't get boring. He challenges me like nobody has, and indulges me just enough. He even knows when I'm being sarcastic (95% of the time) and finds it amusing, and eventually gets it when I'm being serious. And he can banter right back (though he's just not that good with sarcasm, but he tries..).  There is no reason for me to be this paranoid and insecure. Who knows what's wrong with me. It's not that I've ever even really been burned in the past - but perhaps, I've never let anyone get close enough to me to be burned.   Anyway, why is this all coming up? I just got off the phone with him, having spent an hour just blabbing about stuff. Sounds rather normal - except for the fact that we *never spent that much time on the phone ever. Usually getting 20 minutes out of him is a feat. So rather than thinking that he just wants to talk - I mean, the last time we had a phone conversation this long, it was him freaking out about stuff and wanting to take a break, the bastard, just because I talk about marriage doesn't mean that I want to get hitched right this moment - obviously, he's sick and feverish.   Sometimes I just give him too little credit. Because I can. And because it makes me feel more secure, in some twisted, most likely unhealthy, way.    On another, completely unrelated, note,  It Must Have Been Something I Ate: The Return of the Man who Ate Everything , by Jeffrey Steingarten, whom I simply adore, is finally out in paperback! (Don't like hardbacks, they take up too much room and are too heavy to hold up in bed.) First stop tomorrow: the bookstore, so I can pick it up.

      Today is Thursday. (Yes, I'm smart.) That means, oh right, the class of the day is Introduction to Clinical Medicine, which lucky second-year medical students get to take. With a scant week's worth of "training" (in quotations, because people either ditched it or if they were there, didn't really pay attention), they let us loose into hospitals to practice our giving-full-body-physical-exam skills upon the lucky patients who happen to be there. Not the patients you would normally give physicals to, the ones who come in for their annual checkup, but rather those who had to check in for some (usually serious) medical problem.   Okay, it's not as bad as it sounds. We only really focus one part of the physical exam per week, adding the newly learned tasks to our steadily growing repertoire (system by system, starting with vital signs, then the HEENT - head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, then the respiratory system, cardiac, abdominal.. you get the idea. It starts to become quite timeconsuming. Luckily, we are not getting to the genitalia this semester. I don't think I could handle doing a rectal exam quite yet), and the patients are usually soooo bored from being in the hospital that they love to have someone to talk to, and they like helping out med students. Then they get to tell us what *they would ideally have in a doctor, and that just makes their day.  The problem is when the patient you're assigned to is sleeping (the docs tell us to just wake them up, but I feel so bad, I just can't do it), or has family visiting, or is in so much pain that interviewing him (I say him, because I've been assigned to the VA, and the majority of patients are male) is really not productive.   (I don't think I'm violating any HIPAA (some patient privacy thingy) codes here.. there are no real identifying factors, are there? I'm not giving out names and SSN#s, so I should be okay.)  That was the case today. The patient my partner and I had to interview/do a practice physical on was with family and looked half knocked-out anyway. I mumbled, "Where the hell do they get these patients from?" to my partner, as in the past semester, we've been graced with some patients in so much pain that they can barely sit up, which makes listening to their lungs from the back rather difficult, some patients who can't walk - hello, no musculoskeletal exam today!, etcetc. (We also have been lucky enough to have some very chipper, talkative, and knowledgeable patients too.. but those are so rare, especially in the VA, where it seems the majority of the patients are suffering from a number of congenital deteriorating diseases..)  Anyhow, so our patient was otherwise occupied, so my very-enterprising partner and I just decided to go find ourselves another patient, rather than page our preceptor to get another one off his list. And boy, find one we did. I'll call him Mr. A, so I don't have to keep saying "he" and "him."   Mr. A looked coherent and bored - usually the best sort of combination, because he would, in an ideal world, not only be able to talk to us, but do so in an understandable manner.. and he even looked healthy enough for us to perform part of the exam-of-the-day, the neurological exam, on him. Today, after taking a full patient history, we'd do a mini mental status exam (which consists of questions such as, "Do you know where you are?" and "please count backwards from 100 by 7s" - which, I'm sorry, sometimes I don't know the former and the latter takes too much brain power.), a motor exam (testing muscle strength by checking their resistance) and a reflex check (where we get to use the fun examining mallet, yay!)  "So, what brought you to the hospital?" Always start with this question. This is the chief complaint, and you better get it. So Mr. A had a small heart attack.. okay.. "Can you describe the pain for me? blahblahblah.." And it's all very standard, and while he has a rather flat affect, it's okay, he knows what was done to him, seems very alert and with it, and then comes out with..  "So, yeah, I have post-traumatic stress disorder, dating back to 'Nam." Okay, fine. We haven't really learned how to do a mental exam for psychiatric patients yet (no, we weren't in the psych ward), so I stumbled a bit, not really knowing what the appropriate words were in this instance, having never really encountered a patient with a real psych problem. And then comes the kicker: "Yeah, I checked myself into the ER a couple of weeks ago for suicidal thoughts.. and homicidal thoughts.. I didn't really get help that time, I got fed up with the nurse and having to wait there for a long time so I just left."  Oh. Son-of-a-freaking-gun. So *this is what happens when you don't get a patient from the preceptor and decide to find one yourself.  Now what to say? ("So, these homicidal thoughts, are you still having them? Are they directed towards dingbatty med students who are asking you questions you don't really want to answer, perhaps?")  But, after some soft "Oh, I'm sorry"s, the rest of the interview continued, (although I felt a little funny explaining to the patient that we were going to perform a neurological exam on him...) and we walked out unscathed, but all the same, it was just slightly freaky. He seemed stable, but what would have happened if he suddenly felt another homicidal thought coming on? Eeek.   And how do you act in an instance like that? We don't have enough training to know what to do, and are essentially just like anyone else on the street, except with that white coat of authority on, which makes us seem smarter like we really are. I was left fumbling, grasping at straws in order to come up with something to get us over that bump..  Just another fun Thursday. The best part was attempting to find the doc we're supposed to be reporting to, not being able to find him anywhere in the hospital, and getting to leave without another "When I was your age..." lecture.

      So every morning, one of the first things that loads when I open my internet browser are cheap airline fares. It's really a bad idea, and I should change my homepage, because it's just sooooo tempting to just pack up and go. Screw school, the world doesn't really need another doctor, anyway. When it's cheaper to fly to Paris from the East Coast than back home to LA.. well, why wait? Under $200. I spend way more than that on dresses that just accumulate in my closet, waiting for the "perfect occassion" for me to wear them.  And since I'm in school, and not enough of my friends are getting married anytime soon.. those dresses are just collecting dust.   Then again, the amount of money I'd spend shopping while in Paris... oh, it would be ridiculous. So it's really not a bargain, after all.   Maybe I should just move there. Then I'd stop dreaming about being there.  Or I could just buy more dresses. It's an investment in its own right, of course.

      Is this a good idea? For months, upon months, I've been reading other people's blogs as a very effective form of procrastination, yet as everything does, even that wearied. So the thought arose - why not make my own? But do people really want to listen to me prattle on about my life? Not to mention - oh, I've every once in awhile, made fun of people who wanted to put their private life on public display. Yet the idea is tempting.. a whole slew of people you'll probably never meet, yet with whom you're intimate on terms that would never be possible without such a format.  Those AOL chatrooms, taken to the next level. Not to mention my boyfriend.. who inevitably will come up multiple times (fair advance warning!) would just be.. quite simply.. appalled. He is so woefully behind.. doesn't use IM, doesn't fiddle with Friendster - these are all "distractions," he tells me, yet he's quite happy to mess around on my accounts when I'm signed on at his place. (He finally gave up deleting IM from his computer, since every time I'd sit down at his computer, I'd just redownload it again.) And it's only fair to say, oh, that he doesn't understand this at all.   But the voyeurism is fascinating. And that's what brings you here, isn't it.  And on my part, a completely self-indulgent forum where I can just follow a stream of consciousness, and am vain enough to think that other people will actually take interest in such random musings.   I can't promise anything concrete, I can't even promise anything interesting.. maybe I'll just make things up! That's always fun!.. oh, who knows how long it'll even last.   It's an experiment!  PS. And be forewarned.. I like to tinker. I will tinker with the format until I am happy with it. Seeing that I missed an entire episode of  West Wing  to choose a background colour, with which I'm still not happy.. yes, it's going to be awhile..

      Vaguely interesting article in the Los Angeles Times about  urlLink dieting trends . What is actually even more interesting is the inbox, detailing famous diets over the years. My favourite is this one: 1087 William the Conqueror tries a liquid diet for weight loss, taking to his bed and consuming nothing but alcohol.  I believe I've already attempted this one. Curious how they don't post his results. I'm sure one weighs less once one loses his liver due to cirrhosis. Another good one:  1898 The slow-chewing movement is founded by businessman Horace Fletcher. After he is denied life insurance because of his weight, Fletcher drops 40 pounds through a strategy of chewing each mouthful of food to liquid before swallowing it. "Fletcherism" takes off, rah-rahed by diet guru Kellogg, who invents a slow-chewing song for his patients. Why yes! Of course you lose weight! Doesn't everyone know that the smaller the pieces you cut food into, the more the calories that escape through the cutting action? Although with this slow-chewing diet, you're more likely to spit your food, oh pardon, liquid, into the trash, thereby not consuming any calories at all.I personally think I'd just get so bored I'd rather not at eat at all. Ah, here we go, back to drinking. 1960s Era of alcohol-friendly low-carb regimens sees publication of "The Drinking Man's Diet" by Gardner Jameson and Elliott Williams, and Sidney Petrie's "Martinis and Whipped Cream."  Again, I am familiar with this one all too well. Drink your dinner, and end up so miserable the next day you can't eat. Repeat for a week, and you'll be as thin as a whippet, and will have to take to your bed like William the Conqurerer. Finally: 1978 Herman Tarnower publishes the high-protein Scarsdale diet, 700 calories daily. He is killed by his lover in 1980. I have to ask, are these two events related? If so, was his lover on his diet, and so utterly miserable that s/he decided to end it all, by killing him? Why not just... eat? I'm always in a better mood after I eat.

      Most recent email from crankypants:  Will be in California in 4 days! I'm excited too. However, for the past two weeks, I have asked him repeatedly what time he's getting in on what flight. All I know is which airport he's flying into, and that it's Friday morning. Obviously, I get to be kept in the dark, as such information is apparently classified. Maybe I'll find my old Ouija board and see if it can figure the details out.

      List of people on my asses-to-be-kicked list:  *AT&T (okay, fine, it's an entire company. But they cannot fix my stupid phone and watch me end up in the forest like those kids from  The Blair Witch Project  and then DEAD because I don't get digital service there.) *My "friend" Kevin (his solution to helping me help CBG save face while I turn him down: "I say the only way to save face is to sleep with him." Direct quote.)  Hm, that's only two so far. Give me time, I'll come up with more.

      Once upon a time, there was a girl.. let's call her silly twit, ST for short. One summer, between her first and second years of medical school, she decided to split her time between lovely LA and icky Boston, for reasons too boring to discuss. Just - 6 weeks in one place, 6 in the other.   The first 6 weeks of her summer were spent in lovely LA, and she had lots of fun with her boyfriend (hereafter called BF). However, since BF had a Real Job in LA that summer, it meant he unfortunately had to stay there when ST went to icky Boston to take a class at a medical school up there. It was going to be fine, she was going to use the time to study and hang out with friends, and otherwise be a Good Virtuous Girlfriend, ie, no reverting to her pre-faithful self and seeing how many guys she could juggle at once. Besides, it also helped that everyone in her class was ugly, save hot teaching assistant (HTA) and cute British guy (CBG). She even had the wonderful luck to be paired up with CBG as lab partners! What fun! Harmless (at least, in her eyes it was harmless) flirting - a great time to pass the summer. She did realise that CBG was interested, but she made it very clear early on that she was Taken, and Devoted, to BF.   And the summer continued on happily.   Then ST and BF had an argument, which was essentially because he misinterpreted certain matters and freaked out. "Well! So much for being all faithful and crap!" fumed ST. "He is obviously an ungrateful wretch and doesn't deserve my full attention!" And with that little crack in her Shell of Faithfulness, her old maneating ways started to sneak their evil selves back in.   She might have remarked to a mutual friend that she thought HTA was cute, not (really) thinking it would go anywhere. This friend then took matters into his own hands and.. well, to make matters short, last week of classes, ST ended up on a date with HTA. Boy, was he cute! And attentive, and Very Effusive with compliments! Still smarting from the argument with BF from a couple of weeks past, ST totally lapped up this attention (even though she and BF had made up by that point), and horror of all horrors, ST seriously considered cheating on BF. After all, according to her logic, he would Never Find Out, and besides, he deserved it for being such a ratbastard. Yet conscience kicked in at the last minute, and ST realised that she couldn't take TA to bed, no matter how freaking cute he was. And so with a kiss goodnight she sent him on his way home.  Last day of classes, ST drove CBG home, as she usually did because public transportation is a horror. They had become friends by this point, and she offhandedly mentioned the date with HTA. Needless to say, CBG was shocked, not in the least because she had been So Firm at the beginning of class about how she was in a relationship with BF (and because also thought HTA was as sleazy as hell). When she dropped him off, and so with a wave and a promise to keep in touch, she drove home.   When she got home, she was Very Surprised to not only be the recipient of an email from CBG, but also a message on her answering machine! In both, he let her know how Very Adorable he had found her, and if only he had known that she wasn't completely faithful to BF, he would have definitely pursued her. While she found this Very Flattering, there were two things wrong with this: 1) she  was  (attempting to be) completely faithful to BF and 2) she didn't feel The Spark with CBG. Obviously, she did not want to hurt his ego and thus did not tell him of the latter, rather writing a cute little email back about What Could Have Beens and whatnot.   Fastforward to... oh, the present day. ST and BF are still together, although it has been a rather long time (7 weeks) since she has seen him. She  has  kept her word and kept in touch with CBG. Home for vacation, ST emails CBG on the chance that he'd be visiting his folks, who live in Orange County. Surprise of all surprises, he is indeed home! And while both were very busy with various obligations, they did want to see each other and catch up. (And maybe ST is sometimes a little passive aggressive and wanted to make BF a touch jealous, although it seems to frustratingly bounce off him like water off a duck.) So CBG invites her to go drinking with his friends out in Hollywood, where they will be getting a couple of suites. "As long as you can promise me a sofa, or somewhere to sleep!" she happily replies via email, since drunk driving on the freeways is not a good idea In The Least.   She might be a little hormone-ly wound-up, right now, and needing of some Male Adoration (even though BF is coming out to visit next week - still! It has been 7 whole weeks! 49 days!). Maybe her email was a little flirtier than she meant it to be. Yet CBG's response to her sofa line, which she meant as "obviously, I am going to get the bed and you the sofa because I'm a girl" was actually interpreted by him as "we're gonna share the bed." How does she know this, you ask? Well, all of a sudden, the group outing became a hot tub proposition. And ST is definitely in no shape to be in a bikini (although she has bought two recently), not to mention that it's a Very Bad Idea.   Now poor ST is all in a tizzy. She has an inclination towards melodrama, you see, and once she is in this state, cannot see the forest for the trees, it might be said. And poor ST has only two operational Brain Cells right now - and both, along with Common Sense, decided to take their own vacation without telling her! What is she to do? She needs help!  She is frantically searching for a way to gracefully and tactfully extricate herself from this situation, without hurting CBG's feelings and with them still remaining friends. Her wretched friends are either MIA or have prior commitments, and it would really help if she had a wingman right now, since she does want to catch up with him over drinks, and will need to stay at his hotel (the drunk driving matter), but needs it to be purely platonic. And she is deathly afraid that with a few drinks in her, Inhibition and Conscience just might decide to take a break also or be overwhelmed by the Preening Love of Male Adoration, and then what?!   What now? What is going to happen? All questions just waiting to be answered.. but another night. ST has sent off several frantic emails to friends all over the country, asking for advice, and all she can do is sit tight and wait. Less than 36 hours until some sort of decision must be made! Oh! The stress of it all! But it is bedtime now, and the story shall be continued another night.

      High school reunions. I don't know, for me, they'll always be more important than college ones (although to be fair, haven't yet had a college one, but I just  know  this).   I went to an all-girl's high school. Oh, that's right, not just high school, I went there from 4th through 12th grade. Nine years of my life at this lovely institution, where we flitted about in our adorable pinstriped pastel uniforms, blissfully focusing on just our studies, where there were no headaches known as the male species. We graduated 49 people our year, and even though there was no way that we were all friends with each other, nevertheless, with such a small number of students, we all knew each other's business. It was hard not to. Gossip spread like the wind, even after we left and went to our respective colleges (because attending college was a given, it wasn't really a choice.)   Anyhow, Friday night was our first big reunion. 5 years. I had kept in close touch with a small handful of people, and knew about others through the gossip mill. But this presented the perfect opportunity to get up to date on what people were indeed doing, straight from the source. None of this, "so I heard, from so-and-so, who talked to so-and-so-two, that this person was maybe perhaps in New York, but we're not quite sure what she's doing." Cold hard facts is what I was after last night.  I don't know what I was expecting. In 5 years, you expect that people will have changed. That we'd have looked older, more mature, wiser. After all, I feel that I've changed over the past years. That wasn't the case at all. Everyone looked pretty much exactly the same as she did when we graduated in our white dresses. Everyone sounded the same. Even the girl who had left in 8th grade, she hadn't changed much either. It was all too oddly familiar, as if no time had lapsed at all. There were still those who with every word, induced laughter so intense you were doubled over. There were still those who were too cool to talk with everyone else. There were still those who yes, 5 years later, remained as intensely dorky and weird as they were in high school. (I guess you expect some people to get over their awkward stage. Maybe it's not just a stage, maybe it's them.)  Maybe the next reunion will be different. Then we'll be 28, most will be married, some might even have children. That is such a scary prospect.   But let's talk about last night. Of course, there was lots of fake hugs and bright smiles and airkissing. The conventions of society. Even if you're not actually excited to see other people, you fake it. Because that's what is expected when you gather some 20 girls together (as obviously,  urlLink some people  did not attend.)  "Oh! How lovely to see you!" "And how have you been doing?" "That's fabulous!" "It's great to see you!" "What have you been up to?" "So, are you seeing anyone?" "Wow, you look great!"  Etcetera, etcetera, ad nauseum. A person would arrive. Whoever was already there would stand up and move towards the door, en masse, hugging and kissing the new arrival. Platitudes were gushed. The past 5 years of our lives were exchanged, once again. After awhile, it got to be a little overwhelming, and more than a little repetitious.   At least there was wine.   Wine makes everything better. Especially multiple bottles of wine.   Bonding is so much easier when alcohol is involved. The false excitement comes more easily, as does the big smile and the furrowed brow of interest. Time quite simply flies once you're in that alcohol-induced haze, and the next thing you know, it was 11PM, way past the planned ending time of 8.. oh, but the gossiping was so much fun!  Incidentally, upon revealing my plans to become a professor, several people remarked that I would be the professor who hits on her male students. I don't know where people get this erroneous assumption. They're not the first ones to say so, either. Younger guys don't do it for me at all, though I have to admit the bride and the MoH both have very attractive brothers who are still in college. But it's very perplexing, how somehow this is the way other people see me.   *Note to self for next reunion. Not eating all day, and then launching into the wine immediately upon arrival at 5PM, ignoring the tasty hors d'oeuvres, means that you  will  be hungover the next day, and no amount of post-alcohol water drinking will save you. It will also lead you to doing stupid things, like inviting the previously mentioned  urlLink MoH , whom you have long claimed to detest, to a night of debaucherous drinking with a bunch of cute British guys. Why? Just why? Keep all the cute guys for yourself, you moron!

       urlLink Word associations  again! Apparently it's every Sunday. They are very  Harry Potter -ish this week.    Seeker::what/who I need to find my keys, sunglasses and hairclips  Mirror::Snow White  Fire::S'mores! also bonfire on the beach  Goblet::golden chalice  Empty::Pandora's box, after being opened  Secrets::you think nobody knows them, but in reality everyone does  Defense::self-protection  Hatchet::machete  Vapour::misty, ghost-like  Ministry::of Sound?

      Ooh. This is fun:: free association, courtesy of  urlLink LunaNina.com .    Exchange:: coffee (there is a coffee shop near my apartment called Coffee Exchange. It makes sense.)  Parental Advisory::sometimes unnecessary, just use good judgement  Blowout::big party, no holds  Spider::arachnophobia  Happy::as a lark  Intense::brooding, overwhelming, Heathcliff  Corrupt::the Mafia, also Providence government  Got::Milk? (surrounded by too much advertising, perhaps)  Crude::unrefined and unpolished, undesirable traits in a date  Three::is a crowd Oof. My word associations are rather boring. Maybe because I haven't been using my mind much of late. Maybe this takes practice, to come up with interesting reponses. Maybe I should stop making excuses and just admit that I'm boring, sometimes.

      It was suggested by one of my good friends that for the part of my personal statement that asks, "Why do you want to come here for grad school?" I should write the following: I'm pretty. And smart. And my boyfriend is going to be a lawyer and when (if?) I marry him we'll donate lots of money to your school. I think it's short and sweet, and to the point. With all this big to-do about endowments, that'll certainly catch their eye.  Second place is: I'm a snob, you're a snobby school, we'll get along just fine. Not as charming as above, but also to the point. It lacks the money factor, though, but does focus on personality rather than just looks. And isn't personality what counts?  Runner up (suggested by another friend): I'm a princess, you're the ivory tower. It's along the same lines as the 2nd place statement, but a little too chichi spoiled "I'm daddy's darling" for me. And it sounds like the bad opening to a singles ad.

      More Christmas spoilery, this time from the  urlLink LA Times :  "There's a 70% chance that L.A. may get its first wet Christmas since 1983." First the mad cow, than this. Next thing you know, they're going to say that candy canes are dangerous killing instruments (have you ever sucked a candy cane so that the end is a dangerous point? Then you know what I mean) and that Santa isn't real.  Oh, wait.

      Dammit,  urlLink mad cow disease   again . This means no beef for me. No steaks. You don't understand what a dire situation this is. Since I'm convinced I'm anemic (it was just once, to be fair. I was tested before I gave blood, and barely missed the cutoff. So I eat lots of red meat just in case. That, and I like it), how else am I going to get my iron? No supplements or green veggies, please. I want it the good ol' fashioned red meat way. Gah. Spoil my Christmas, why don't they.

      Wedding update:  Had lunch with the bride and the maid of honour today. Let's just come clean 'bout things. I cannot abide the MoH. She is one of those fake nice people, with a suburban socialite Junior League air, down to her hair, done in that pouffy bob (think Julia Stiles's character in  Mona Lisa Smile ). We were part of the same group in high school, because that's how things fell. Not because we actually enjoyed each other's company. And we knew that we weren't really friends, and completely and utterly lost touch after high school ended.  Then my friend decided to up and get married. And made this witch the MoH. Dammit, this means I'm going to have to Spend Time With Her and Pretend To Like Her.   After the requisite hug and double-kiss, and absolute gushing over this and that associated with the wedding, conversation naturally moved on to the significant others, then back to the wedding, then back to the SOs, etcetc.  I'd recap here, but it was so boring that I wanted to shoot myself. However, I did want to ask, "So, when are you getting engaged?" A harmless question, on the surface, but definitely very loaded. You see, she's been dating her current boyfriend for the past 5 years, and they are no closer to getting to the altar than when they first started going out. And we all know that she wants nothing more than to be married. Yet he is not ready, and doesn't show any signs of being ready. And she plays it off as it being okay with her. But you know deep down that it's not.   Sometimes, I am so petty.   However, I feel justified in saying that the MoH has an altered sense of reality. That is, believing that the bridal party can up and take 3 weekends out of their life (if not more) to attend 1) a bridal shower in April, 2) the bachelorette party in June and then 3) the wedding itself. She sat there, talking about it as if well, certainly, everyone can arrange her schedule around the wedding and the related festivities.   If everyone lived out here in LA, it would work. But this is not the case - 4 of the bridesmaids, including me, live on the East Coast and the MoH and remaining bridesmaid live in LA.  Of course, all these events are planned in LA. At least I'm from here, have parents that will be willing to pay for the plane ticket(s) and with whom I can crash, and plan on being here over the summer (the blissful life of an academic). The bride also lives on the East Coast, for that matter, but her parents will definitely spare no expense when it comes to their firstborn (and only daughter) getting married. The other 3 from the East Coast.. hm, not so much, and from what the bride tells me, money is rather tight with them.   I know it's the bride's only wedding (one hopes). We all want to make her happy. But I don't want to be in the vicinity of the MoH (who has been happily planning everything without consulting anyone but the bride) or the bride when they find out that half of the bridal party cannot show up to either of the first two events, due to time restrictions (they are all also in the real working world, which I hear isn't so flexible with vacation time) or financial restrictions.   Oh well. All I hope is that the bachelorette party is in Vegas. Even though I hate Vegas, it'd be fun to have a bachelorette party there. At least there will be lots of cute guys. (One hopes.. but not me. I am dating someone. That's right.) But that's me. The bride is definitely more placid and not as adventuresome (this girl Never drove beyond the San Marino/Pasadena (select parts only, please!) borders in the 18 years she lived here before going to college), and the MoH is pulling for us to rent a house near Palm Springs instead. Maybe we can then arrange it so it's the same weekend as the bachelor party, which apparently will be a camping trip,  sans  strippers. And then the bride and groom can sneak off and find each other and hug and swear that they will never again be apart,  a la  Trista and Ryan. How heart-touching.   (Yes, lots of posts! First night in awhile that I haven't been busy, and I find that I don't know what to do with myself.)

      I am always nervous making airplane flights. What if I get the dates wrong? The times wrong? What if I accidentally make my flight for the week  after  school starts instead of the week before? What if I forget which date my flight is on and I miss my flight completely? What if the airline never received notice of my ticket purchase in the first place and I am not actually on the flight?   I am a little paranoid when it comes to scheduling matters.  But in over 6 years of flying from one coast to the other, I never made a mistake. I always arrived  before  classes started. I was always safe. And then this coming January, I thought I was in the clear. After all, I'm not returning to classes, am I? No, I'm returning to research, which pretty much means I can get back to the East Coast anytime I want. So even if I messed up the dates, I'll be fine. Life was easy. And then I decided to schedule a visit to see crankypants at school in the South.  It should have been so simple. Get in on Wednesday, leave again on Thursday. Yes, perhaps I could give myself more time in my apartment, but there was really no need to. After all, everyone else will be in class. And I could have sworn that those were the two flights that I made.  Get in on Wednesday, leave again on Thursday.  I got my new calendar today and decided to write in the flight times. So I checked my itineraries online.  Get in on Wednesday, leave again on... WEDNESDAY??  It's not the end of the world, I suppose. My flight gets in at 10:30AM, and the second one doesn't leave until 2:30PM. My apartment is only 20 minutes away from the airport, so I have time to go home and take a shower and repack. It could be much worse.   BUT!!! What if my luggage gets lost? Okay, then I bring my toiletries and what clean underwear I have in my carry-on. What if my first flight is delayed and I don't get into Providence until my second flight has already left? Then I'm royally screwed. I can think of many many  many  things that could go wrong.  And I have an entire month in which to come up with new things that can go wrong. This is not going to be a healthy pasttime.

      Yesterday was my (more or less) annual trip to Disneyland. One of the advantages of living in LA means that you can go frequently to "The Happiest Place on Earth" and therefore get to know it like the back of your hand (as things rarely change there, except for tickets and food prices which just get more and more expensive.) Surprisingly, it was not as crowded as say, a weekday in the middle of the summer, but it was crowded nonetheless.   And I hate large crowds, as I'm sure that most people do. It's because that many people in large crowds have no idea how to act. Instead of just walking ahead, as would make the most sense, any one of the following is more likely than not to occur:   The person in front of you will just suddenly stop. Just like that. You're happily walking along, remarking on the progress you're making, and then BAM! There's no good reason why s/he has stopped. Maybe there was something in the wind. Maybe their feet just stopped working. Who knows.  The group in front of you, instead of walking in pairs ( a la  Madeleine) or in threes, walks as a human wall. That is, they all walk right next to each other, nevermind that they're completely blocking the pathway so that there's no way to get around them aside from climbing on trees to swing over them or just plowing through them. This technique is very impressive if you're fighting another group of people and want to charge them, but in real life, is just inconsiderate and obnoxious, especially if they're moving at a snail's pace. Or stop suddenly.   The person behind you in line has no idea of what personal space is, and every time you move an inch forward, s/he moves 6 inches, thereby colliding into you. See, in line, it's okay to be stopped. (It is the only place where it is okay to be stopped, as a matter of fact.)   Staking out territory four hours before whatever parade/water show means yes, good seating for that family, but for everyone else still trying to get around the amusement park, they are just another obnoxious obstacle that you can't even step on. And the fact that they tend to spread out acres of blankets to reserve their room just means that less sidewalk for everyone else to step on, which means that you either have to suddenly become Catherine Zeta-Jone's character in  Entrapment  (because factor in the cords that Disneyland puts up to demarcate areas and you have to be limber enough to do the limbo to get by) or your risk getting very dirty looks from said squatters.   I'm sure there's more stuff. I just can't think of it right now. Incidentally, it's time for Disneyland to update the technology on their rides. Within the last year, a person got thrown off on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad (as in, mid-ride s/he went flying off the car) and I believe someone else sustained neck/back injuries on Space Mountain. (Not surprisingly, both rides were closed yesterday. Or was that Indiana Jones? I can't really remember.) Note to Disney folks: you might want to check out Matterhorn Bobsleds next. The first time we were in line for that ride, one side broke down. The second time, we were on the ride ourselves and our side broke down.  A little scary, suddenly being stopped mid-whizzing turn. They had to then push us back into the station. Needless to say, we didn't attempt the ride a 3rd time - who knows what would have happened then.

      When I get drunk, my speech changes in one of the following ways: 1) I am suddenly fluent in French, and prattle on in that language, 2) I am suddenly fluent in Spanish or 3) I adopt an English accent. Sometimes everyone around me is lucky and I just get verbal diarrhea, but every once in awhile one of the following happens.   The first two are rather explicable. I was a French major undergrad, and spent a semester there, so fluency in that is pretty much expected, it just doesn't "happen" until I'm drunk. Before I took French, I took Spanish for umpteen years, so that's not that surprising either. What is distinctly weird is when I come out with the English accent. I've only been to London once, some 8 years ago, and to be honest, I didn't really enjoy it that much. Hell, London is really just like Boston, except people there have non-icky Boston accents, everything is in pounds, and the food is considerably worse. And I haven't been anywhere else in the UK. There is no reason at all for me to start speaking with this certain accent, and I'm sure I do it quite poorly, since then my knowledge of it comes from movies and TV shows.  With the language changes, it only works when I'm around people who can speak said language also. Or not even, in fact, I've been known to jabber in French even when the person I'm talking to never took French. Then I just seem like I'm crazy. But that's normal. Or maybe I'm foreign.  But with the British accent, the following conversation usually ensues.  Person to whom I'm talking: "So, you're from England?" Me: "Um, ewww, no." Person: "So where are you from?" Me: "Oh! Wonderful LA!" Person: "Did you grow up in England?" Me: "Hell no, didn't I say I was from LA?" Person: "So what's with the accent?" Me: "Oh, am I speaking with an accent?"  It's really quite ludicrous, since I do it unconsciously. Who knows what possesses me. Luckily, it usually wears off. Unlike the time I returned from Paris with not a French accent, but an English one, and had it for a week. The first time I went there with my college roommate, I came back with quite the Queen's English, to her eternal confusion, since I don't even believe we met anyone from the UK while in Paris. I had to make a conscious effort to *not speak with an English accent, and she made fun of me for ages.   On the wedding front. My friend has finally chosen a bridesmaid dress. Finally! And - I got my way! I had ixnayed the first dress on account that the neckline was too high, and I bemoaned its full length (her wedding is in August, it's gonna be hot!), and I told my friend that when (if) I get married, everyone's in tea-length dresses. So what did she end up choosing? A strapless tea-length dress. I prevail again. I always win. Always. There's no use trying to resist me.

      I've found, that for me, it's really hard to be subtly bitchy. Sure, I can pull it off every once in awhile, but I'm the snarky bridge-burning sort.  No, correct that. I have a mind like a steel trap when it comes to injustices (whether perceived or real) against me. I keep score. It's petty and infantile, perhaps, but that's how I am. Everyone has a good column and a bad column, and there are tick marks on either side.  Usually, they balance each other out, and I'm fine. But sometimes, the tick marks in the bad column start accumulating, and there's nothing on the other side to cancel them out. And my level of tolerance is rather high-ish, so it doesn't bother me. At least, not too much, in the beginning. Slowly but surely, however, I start to notice. And then every little bad tick mark multiplies and instead of becoming incrementally worse, it becomes exponentially worse. I can generally keep it under wraps, though.. but every once in awhile, I can't. And then one little annoying action, which usually I'd just brush off,  and that's when the outright bitchiness comes into play, because we have far surpassed the realm of tact and diplomacy.   I want to send email, call, with the intent of solely pointing out how ungracious and selfish they're being. I'd prefer to cancel plans even if it means sitting at home alone on a Friday night instead, just to make a point. Because by golly, that point wants to be made, loud and clear. I would usually prefer to be tactful, but then think that the other wouldn't realise tactful if it hit him/her over the head, so obviously I'd have to be rude and upfront with it.   Anyhow. On that note. A nice pedicure will calm me down somewhat. Hopefully.

      Things that  really  annoy me:  Friends, who at the last minute, want to add an uncertain number of people to a dinner reservation. And who are so freaking lazy that they don't actually call the restaurant themselves (keep in mind that they have ready access to a phone, and seem to be able to answer emails right away, which hints that they're not *that busy at work) that they wait for you to do it. Even though plans have been set for the two of you for the past month, and it's*their (okay, her) friends who are joining in, and you had to make the dinner reservations in the first place even though you currently live across the country and they (she) live(s) 2 miles away from the restaurant.  And you are driving them (her) to the airport the next day (and also did so during that big freaking Thanksgiving rush which took 4 hours, round trip, out of your (my) way) - they (she) could be a little more gracious and helpful with things as simple as dinner reservations, n'est-ce pas?

      As I am obviously procrastinating on writing my personal statement for grad school applications (things will never change), I decided to further expound on another of my wonderful theories.  That is, guys with 4-letter names are generally no good.   This includes guys who by birth were given 4-letter names (ie John, Marc), or guys who choose to go by 4-letter names, even if their given names are longer (ie Mike, Pete).  Hang out with them, fine. Avoid dating them at all costs, though. It will not be a happy experience. You will invariably end up a bitter person.   There are exceptions, of course. I've found that most Jeffs are upstanding individuals, Nicks are inconsistent but generally well-meaning, and Daves are variable. And of course, there are certain British actors (Ewan McGregor, Jude Law, Hugh Grant) who are exempt from the rule, mainly because they are beautiful gods who cannot be held accountable to such earthly laws.    But mark my words. Those chaps with 4-letter names. They're bad for you, and it won't be a fun ride while they break your heart.

      Yay! Am home again!  Reason # 98234 why I love LA: My parents, after we all left the house, decided to join the age of technology and not only get DSL, but wireless internet as well. This enables me to lounge in my hammock outside and be on the computer at the same time. Also, note that it's warm enough in December to do so.   Reason # 234980 why I hate flying: I always end up sacrificing my nails to the flying gods. Yesterday, TWO - one whilst packing, one in transit.   Hm. I need a pedicure.

      So, I have this theory (I have many theories, including the one where people get cuter the closer you get to the beach, the one where people on the East Coast are more prone to skin cancer because they go out and tan frantically and then burn whenever it's warm enough, or visit tanning salons, whereas on the West Coast - or more specifically LA - you have a perpetual year-round tan so there is no burn, etcetc) that everyone has two stomachs - the regular stomach, and the dessert stomach which enables one to consume dessert even after eating a completely filling meal.   This stomach theory was brilliant proven when I was visiting a friend in Chicago. We went to a French restaurant, couldn't decide what we wanted to eat, and so ended up getting a bowl of soup apiece...followed by the splitting of 6 appetizers. It doesn't sound like a lot, but we couldn't touch another bite after the 1 round of 3 appetizers, and artfully arranged the food on the remaining so it looked like we had eaten lots of it. Nevertheless, we ordered dessert anyway, because what's a proper meal without dessert? The waitress thought we were absolutely nuts, and we got plenty of weird looks that night.   However, I am even more fully evolved - not only do I have the regular meal stomach and the dessert stomach, I also have a pasta stomach. That is, I can eat a large bowl of pasta and somehow it just gets absorbed by my system and I am Still Hungry, as though I hadn't consumed anything at all.   Outrage of the day: They are remaking my beloved  Roman Holday , which stars the lovely Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. It is going to be called  Chasing Liberty  and will feature Mandy Moore. Seriously. Is Hollywood so out of ideas that they have to go back to the classics and screw them up?

      As I looked over pictures from Friday night before sending them out, I realised that they all had one horribly common trend: that I don't remember taking any of them.   I am a happy drunk, a fun drunk. Not morose and maudlin. And the best part of it is that while people realise that I'm drunk, they don't realise quite  how  drunk I am, which is usually about 3-4 drinks more than they're thinking. I have very lucid and coherent conversations, apparently - I say apparently because I don't recall them the next day. It is quite scary that I black out/forget things so often, but I haven't harmed myself yet. So it's okay, at least for now.   However, drinking a magnum+ of wine is not recommended under any circumstances.

      I am done! With exams, with med school in general, done done done!  But somehow I thought it would feel more exciting. Maybe it'll kick in when I return next semester to do research, and everyone else will still be in class. Hahahaha. I am going to be such a pain in the ass then, and everyone knows it.   And I get to go home tomorrow! Of course I have not started to pack yet. Why would I bother? That's what tomorrow morning is for.   Completely unrelated. It is very weird to think that next August, one of my closest friends is getting married. I've known her since 4th grade, and she's getting married in 8 months. She met her fiance our senior year of high school, and they're getting married entirely too soon - though they have been together for almost 6 years now. It doesn't help that I can't stand him. She doesn't know this, and it's a good thing she doesn't know about this blog. He is condescending and pretentious, and has the largest jaw in the world. Among my friends, he's known as the Joker (from Batman). He's also a regular stick-in-the-mud and already acts 50 at the young age of 23. For instance, they set aside a weekend to dust (that's right,  dust ), and of course argued over proper techniques. And every Sunday, without fail, he makes a large pot of soup for lunch for the rest of the week. But she's happy, and I'm happy that she's happy. However, they do fight about every last part concerning the wedding, as for some reason, he wants to be involved in every decision-making step. (What a stupid guy. Doesn't he realise that certain girls - his fiancee being one of them - have planned every last detail of their wedding since the age of five? The guy doesn't get any input. He just has to show up and choose groomsmen. That's the extent of his involvement.) And then I make fun of him with all my other friends. I feel like a horrible friend.. but really, he sucks.   And she referred to him as her husband the other day, which was just the weirdest thing ever. I asked her if it was weird for her to call him that, and she said that she's been doing it for awhile, so it's normal now.   I am jealous that she has everything already figured out. But at the same time, I wonder if she doesn't miss being a freewheeling single (not that she has ever been, so you can't miss what you don't know).   At the same time, I'm freaking out because I just realised that I've been going out with crankypants for 18 months, and that this coming summer will mean we've dated for 4 consecutive summers, and I am feeling this intense need to sow my wild oats, because commitment at this age is too much. It happens about every six months (usually in those time spans where I haven't seen him for over a month due to final exams), and is usually cured when I go on a date with someone else and then feel horrible about it afterwards, which keeps me in line for the next semester.

      After actually reviewing my psychiatry notes, I've decided that I'm the horrid combination of histrionic and narcissistic. Both found in the dramatic cluster of personality disorders, a histrionic personality is characterised by dramatic and attention-seeking behaviour, leading to a caricature of femininity (or masculinity), while in the latter the person is grandiose, needs attention, shows a lack of empathy for others and acts as if they are superior and unique to others. The examples the professor gave in class were Blanche ( A Streetcar Named Desire ) and Ann-Margaret's character in  Grumpy Old Men , respectively.   Me, I like to just say that I'm whimsical and fun-seeking. Heehee.

      Must stop watching  When Harry Met Sally . While it is one of the best movies  ever , the last several times watching it I've become horribly depressed upon viewing, because somehow, in my poor addled brain, I have convinced myself that I am Sally and that crankypants is Joe, and that after years of dating, he's going to dump me on my sorry ass and end up marrying his dumb blonde paralegal. Who knows why I think this - who can explain the thought processes of the truly crazy? But what am I going to do - and who is my Harry? What if I don't have a Harry?   And this is becoming a recurring problem, especially since I feel compelled to watch the movie every 10 days or so.  And the same thing happens over, and over, and it's not like I can really talk to crankypants about it, since he'll just be further convinced that I'm nuts.   Also, I am never drinking again - spent all day yesterday in a state of intense weariness induced by the consumption of much of a magnum of wine the night before. However, I do think that I may have diabetes, based on the amount of water I drink. Steph says it might be because I eat lots of salty foods. However, since I have diagnosed myself as histrionic, I need the attention of a potential diabetes diagnosis.

      Bleh. I'm up entirely too early (check time of post), and apparently I really damaged the cuticle on one of my fingers because it hurts and there's old clotted blood there. Ewww. And I think I might still be drunk, but Nobody Else Is Up Yet and I Want Eggs Benedict  now .  Yes, I am a bossy little five-year-old.   It all started last night (okay, really, I've always been this way. But last night's events started..) when we decided to go to the movies. *I* wanted to see either  Stuck on You  or  Something's Gotta Give  but everyone else who was going to the movies wanted to see  Intolerable Cruelty  (which I had already seen) at the $1.99 movie theatre that apparently smells like urine. And like hell I wanted to go there. But! Luckily the movie wasn't playing, so I put a plug in for either of the other two movies and of course ended up getting my way ( Something's Gotta Give  - it was absolutely hilarious, by the way, and totally recommended). Apparently it was quite amusing that I chanted "I win I win!" all the way to the movie theatres - good thing only Steph was with me. The sad thing is, I didn't even really realise I was saying it, she had to point it out to me. It really wasn't a competition.  She also threw in, as I noted on the ickiness of some sketchy motel as we drove by, that "I feel like a proletariat next to you."   Then the true diva-ness started. A friend was having a party, and I declared (very loudly, in the movie theatre), "I'm not gonna drink beer." So after picking up a couple magnums of wine, returned with Steph to my apartment and decided that what I was wearing simply wouldn't work (which was, a tank top and jeans). Keep in mind that nobody ever gets dressed up in this med school, but Steph aptly pointed out, "People expect you to dress up." Now, see, what does that say to you? That I'm a royal pain in the ass? If that's what you thought, you're damn right. So I trotted out my new BCBG top, applied makeup (again, going way overboard for a med school party where people haven't even heard of makeup, you'd think we lived in the midwest or Alaska) and off we went.  The two magnums made a big splash. Or, more like, "sonofabitch, she's too good to drink beer?" (The answer to that is yes.) But then, because I was wildly overdressed (jeans and a cute top, and I was over-dressed? Geeze) I wouldn't take off my coat until after 4 or so glasses of wine, preferring to look like a little snot who was too good to stay very long. Finally, however, I gave Steph my coat and made her wade through the throng of people to put it away.   The rest of the night is pretty much a blur, but there are some highlights. Me finally getting to talk to an old friend, who I might or might not have slept with last year (that's right, while I was dating crankypants, I am a wench too) who then got a girlfriend and proceeded to be too involved with her to talk to me for an entire year. That, and somehow she knew about us, even though I was actually discreet for once and didn't talk about it to anyone in med school. The entire conversation essentially went like this, though.  Me: You're an asshole. Him: It goes both ways. Me: No, really, it's all your fault. Him: Okay, fine, I'm an ass.  No, it was much better than that, and hopefully he won't be a ratbastard and proceed to now not talk to me for another year. We really wouldn't have worked out, I'm too high maintenance for him and he would have ended up smacking me, which I probably deserve. Crankypants is much better suited to my high strung ways.   There are also many pictures on my digital camera that I don't remember being taken, that's always lots of fun. Probably because I delegated the picture-taking to someone else because I was too busy yammering away, and picture-taking would involve me mingling with too many people I didn't feel like talking to.   Oh, and after pouring my first drink - oh, who am I kidding. I looked at the bottles of wine, decided I was too lazy to open them and gave the corkscrew to someone else. And then I proceeded to ask someone else - anyone - to pour me drinks anytime my glass was more than half-empty. Because I wasn't going to be lifting anything, no sirree, not me. And somehow I just radiate brattiness - I just met my friend's new boyfriend, yet somehow he knew that I wasn't a public transportation sort of person and I'm glad he felt comfortable enough teasing me about it, yet still! How do I radiate the "I don't know what buses are for" aura so well?  And the night ended with me proclaiming that I was much too drunk to drive, and handing my keys over to Steph to make her drive me home. Poor her. I wonder why she puts up with me.   And now, all I want are freaking eggs benedict and nobody is up, so I'm slowly working my way through a box of microwaveable chicken nuggets. And I probably should lie down, all this sitting up isn't good for me. Plus, lying down, I can attempt to palpate my liver - if you can feel it, it means its cirrhosed. I swear I feel something in that region..

      Harumph. I would like to proclaim one  urlLink Scarlett Ace  as a out and out wench. I have known her for twelve years - that's right, TWELVE - and I talk to her on nearly a daily basis. However, I find out about her love life the way everyone else does - Via Her Blog.  This is quite obviously despicable behaviour, and my feelings are muchly hurt.   After all, don't I share all with her? What happened to good ol' reciprocity?   Like I said, harumph.

      There has been a trend to my recent dreams. They all feature me getting laid. Which is quite nice, but it would be nicer if it were reality, not some stinking dreams.   This has led me to deduce that I have been celibate for entirely too long.  Yet, there is nothing I can really do about it that wouldn't involve me cheating on crankypants. And it's another 3 weeks - to the day! - until I see him again.  Over the past 18 months of this stinking relationship, I have had longer celibate stretches than I had when I was single. Obviously, there is something wrong with this. Usually I like the distance - it allows me to run amock and do things, like go to open casting calls for  The Bachelor  tonight with friends, that I probably wouldn't get to do if we were around each other all the time.  But the long periods without sex really suck.   And then I start getting all depressed, and convinced that I'm never going to find anyone to marry.   The reasonable thing to think is - hey, you're only 23! Entirely too young to be tying the knot! (Even though it seems like everyone my age  is  getting hitched.)   But no, it's so much more fun to wallow in this utterly depressed and forlorn state.  And what sparked this latter melodramatic mood? Watching Trista and Ryan get married last night. Geeze. Sometimes I'm a complete sap and entirely pliable piece of putty in the network's clever clutches.   I also have not been hungry for the past couple of days. Obviously, something is seriously wrong, because I am never not hungry. Usually, I'm constantly hungry. But the only things I want to eat right now are pasta drizzled with a little olive oil and .. well, really, that's it. Even the shipment of  urlLink  truffles  from one of my friends at home isn't tempting at all. And they're good truffles too, and she had to make several special trips while she was in San Francisco to hit the store while it was open.  Maybe I have a tapeworm.

      I was flipping through the January 2004 issue of  Harper's Bazaar , which I subscribe to only because each issue costs $0.75. You can't get anything for that little anymore! And sadly, that's precisely how much the magazine is worth. But it is entertaining, and has lots of pretty pictures which can be used in collage postcards which I make when I am in ultra-procrastination mode.   My favourite articles are the ones where they poll socialites and various people of that sort as to what they eat and how much they exercise in a day.   After I got over my initial shock, due to me not reading headlines and skipping over "Who's eating what for dinner?" and assuming that nobody ate more than 1000 calories the day (I made this mistake repeatedly, getting more indignant every time I thought that so-and-so consumes only 515 calories per day, and then realising that that was the calorie count only for dinner.. wow, i'm slow), I noted a few trends:  1) A good deal of people are into that nasty as hell Emer'gen-C nutitional supplement powder. I had it once. It comes in a little packet like Kool-Aid, but tastes about 50000 times worse. You mix it into water, and it's supposed to give you all sorts of energy. Rather, it makes me want to puke - admittedly, that requires energy, so maybe it does serve its purpose.  2) They're all really good at portion control. 10-15 gummy bears. 6 almonds. What the hell? Once I get started, I just keep on going. There's no stopping at a measly dozen. Except for the "one stalk of steamed kale" - haha, I just wanted to throw that in there because I thought it was funny that one would eat just one lone stalk. Why stop at one? Kale is all sorts of good for you.  3) Some people work out for inordinate amounts of time. 90 minutes of Bikram yoga at 7AM? If I am up at 7AM, it's 'cause I still haven't gone to bed from the night before, or I have to catch a plane flight. Those are the only two reasons that I'd be up that early. Definitely not to exercise, and not for that amount of time. Same for the 1-hour run at 9AM. You are lucky if I'm awake at 9AM, and then the most stenuous thing I'll do is shower and  maybe  dry my hair before  Regis and Kelly  comes on. (And that same chick later does an hour of weight training. Who has the energy for all of this?! Maybe I need that nasty powder crap in my water)  And please. Carol Alt eats 3600 calories in a day? And only does 20 minutes of "Tibetan exercises" and 10 minutes of jumping on her trampoline (at 1AM, no less!) - and maintains that figure? No way in freaking hell. Obviously, they didn't poll her on a day when she visits her liposuctionist. And none of her food is heated to more than 118 degrees, for health benefits unknown to me. All her food sounds like it came from scary crunchy hippy granola-y food place. Germinated almonds and cinnamon-raisin manna, which is a sprouted bread? I'm scared even contemplating those.   Maybe I need a trampoline. Or maybe it's code for: sex. Or: visit to liposuctionist or toilet bowl.  So while I sit here, eating my nice so-not-healthy quesadilla (made with a regular fat flour tortilla), with cheddar cheese (not nonfat cheese, nonfat cheese is for mortaring bricks together and repairing countertops) and half an avocado... well, I don't know what point I'm trying to make. I definitely won't be called up by  Harper's Bazaar  anytime soon to tell them about my daily eats. But that's not such a great loss.  Then people like me would make fun of me. Heeheee.

      It's interesting what I'll do in the name of procrastination. Take Saturday afternoon. I had such good intentions of actually studying, since I was feeling better than I had the entire previous week.. and what happened? I ended up in my friend's apartment, as we sat at the window laughing at people walking by. Not that anything funny was even happening.. no, it was just people walking in the snow. That didn't stop us from making fun of them, though. "Crazy people!" we'd yell at them, as we munched on butter cookies we made.. yes, also another procrastination device.  And this wasn't just for 20 minutes.. oh no, it was a good 7 hours, between watching  Dirty Dancing  and whatever else was on TV. Maybe  we  were the crazy people.  But we did come up with a brilliant idea: the boyfriend trap. Poor Kate wants a boyfriend. And so I devised something that could put our staring out the window to good use, and it's very simple - and environmentally friendly as well! All we'd do is ice over the patch of sidewalk in front of her apartment. Then, if a cute guy fell, we could run outside and save him! Et voila, the boyfriend trap.  Of course, this would have entailed us going outside to pour water on the snow, which we definitely weren't doing, and she didn't have any balloons so we could accomplish the same effect with water balloons, or a Super Soaker. Oh well. It was worth a thought.   So we just stayed in her cozy apartment, yelling, "Crazy people!" anytime people walked by.  And some people say I have the attention span of a goldfish. Harumph.

      So last night, I did something I always hate doing. Gah, nothing illegal, take your dirty mind out of the gutter. It was a whole lot less innocent than that, but in my book, such a no-no. I took sleeping pills to fall asleep.  I've always been a lucky person when it comes to sleep-related matters. That is, I close my eyes, and fall asleep. Just like that. A heavy sleep, too. It used to annoy the crap out of my college roommate, who suffered from insomnia and had to take prescription sleeping pills that only worked half of the time, and ear plugs, in order to fall asleep and hopefully stay asleep. It really annoyed her those times the phone rang when we were both asleep - in my blissful conked out state, I wouldn't hear it, but she unfortunately would, so she'd have to climb down off her loft in order to answer it - and most of the time, the call was for me. (Generally, some guy I had hooked up with the week before who was hoping for a late-night booty call - the poor manners! If they had called while I was awake, I probably would have obliged!)  And I think that sleeping pills are generally such a bad idea - if you go to bed around the same time every night, get enough sleep so that you don't have to rely on caffeine to stay awake the next day, you don't really need them. Or, at least, this is what I keep telling crankypants, who has the very bad habit of drinking like 5 Diet Cokes (at least it's Coke now, he used to drink Pepsi which I think tastes like sugary swill), then  needing  to take sleeping pills to fall asleep to counteract the caffeine he's ingested during the day. Obviously, if he cut out the cola, he wouldn't need the sleeping pills. Anyhow..  Being in medical school, in addition to tampering with my health, has also screwed up my sleep. In that, sometimes I get so stressed out I can't sleep. Okay, wait, that never happens. Haha. I'm just trying to blame something else on med school.   However, the debacle of the previous night, where I couldn't stay asleep because I was  so  sick, just sucked, and I was determined that that wouldn't happen again. So out came the sleeping pills (OTC stuff. None of the fun prescription drugs. I don't see the benefit in having two doctors as parents if they don't prescribe you the good drugs. However, I have enough Cipro to protect the entire East Coast in case of an anthrax attack, I swear.).   But then I started worrying. The reason I couldn't sleep the night before was because I got so congested I couldn't breathe, so I'd have to get up to blow my nose. What would happen if I was knocked right now, got so congested I couldn't breathe, and then  died ? That would be a horrible way to die - death by snot.   So I fretted over this matter for awhile.. and then decided, what the hell, might as well take the sleeping pills. If I died, so be it. But if I wasted another day languishing on my futon (which really is a lot of fun) instead of studying for finals, it would not be so good.   It turned out to be a good idea in the end. I had a quite lovely dream about Paris.. actually, all of my dreams are stressful, for some reason, and involve some modicum of strife, trouble, worry and/or angst. It's really very curious. Why can't I have nice peaceful dreams?  And my dream got all sorts of facts about Paris wrong. I mean, there is no such place as the Place d'Ailancourt, and the 19th arrondisement is not in the southeast corner of Paris. And Paris does not look like Fantasyland. And if you don't have money to pay the cabdriver, acceptable currency are not animation cells that are on a film strip that you pull out of your camera. I know where all the Herve Chapelier stores are - there are only two, not three like I dreamed, and they're in the 1st and in the Latin Quarter, not over in the 13th. I also know where all the Petit Bateau stores are, and none of them are in the 13th either. It is quite sad that I do remember this, yet can't remember diddly-squat about medical school.  However, the one fact I did get right in my dream was regarding my favourite restaurant of all time, Au Gamin de Paris. I even remembered the correct street address in my dream - 51, rue Vielle-du-Temple, in the Marais. It's nothing fancy, usually isn't in any guidebooks.. but it is the best place ever. I was first introduced to it my sophomore year in college, when my roommate and I went to Paris for spring break and dined there - her grandparents had an apartment around the corner, so lucky her, she'd known about it for forever. It's definitely not Alain Ducasse, but it's good, solid food. The kind of cooking where they allow the quality of the food to shine through, rather than it being all about technique and decoration. It's the first place I'll eat at when I arrive in Paris, and the last one before I leave, it holds  that  kind of place in my heart. When I studied in Paris the spring of my junior year, I'd eat there approximately once a week. I'd always order the same thing - salade au confit de canard, a carafe of the house white, and finish with a slice of their amazing gateau au chocolat a la mode, or the tarte aux fraises, if it was in season. It sounds simple, but it was simply transcendent - the salad was a bed of mixed greens, with this amazing dressing, chunks of duck confit, and apples scattered in there as well. The desserts were always on display at the bar when you walked in - it was truly a treat when the strawberry tarts were in season, their crust was flaky and buttery, the strawberries naturally sweet. The chocolate cake was another marvel - dense, rich and amazing, it needed the ice cream to cut the chocolatey goodness. And the people there were never mad that I bucked traditional French convention and only ordered a salad and dessert, rather than a first course (which would have been the salad), a second (usually some meat or fish) and then dessert. Rather, they were amused that I ordered the exact same thing every meal, and often joked that they weren't even going to bother giving me a menu because what would be the use?   That was indeed a fantastic semester of eating. I even lost weight, eating everything I wanted - probably because I walked everywhere. When they'd have yet another transportation strike, instead of cabbing it home, I'd walk back from my office in near Place de l'Opera to my apartment near the Bastille. Not a short walk, by any means, but it would be quite pleasant. And I'd walk around during my 90-minute lunch breaks - primarily because I hated eating by myself. And I ate all the bread, chocolate and cheese I wanted, drank more than my fair share of wine.. and I lost weight. Ah, the unfairness of it all. I really need to move back to Paris, that's what it is. And after describing my favourite meal at Au Gamin... sigh.  The next year, I returned for spring break, and of course dragged everyone to Au Gamin for our first dinner. When we sat down, the owner of the restaurant came over to our table and said, "Welcome back, it's been such a long time!" Quite honestly, there's no better greeting than that. (This annoyed my college roommate, since she had been the one to introduce me to the restaurant, and they did not recognise her at all. Hahaha. Stupid wench. I am just a more memorable person.) And the waiter almost smirked when he took my order, since of course it did not deviate from the norm. There is nothing better than to be remembered. Especially in Paris, which is (stereo)typically snobbish, especially towards Americans.   I worry now that he's forgotten me. It happens, I haven't been there regretably in two years. But someday, I will own an apartment over there, definitely in the Marais, near Au Gamin, and I'll always be that silly American girl who orders the same meal every time.

      Day 3. This is ridiculous. I don't remember having been sick for this long before. Even the aforementioned illness given to me by crankypants (who is now mocking my illness, his latest comment on my infirmity was: "I just don't understand how I always used to get sick, but now don't as much, and you..." Yeah, don't finish that sentence, once (if) I get better, I will kick your sorry behind) only lasted a day and a half. You know how you get so achy and stuffy you can't sleep? Yep. Argh. Am so not in a good mood.  And I told my mother last night that I thought I was dying. She laughed at me, and told me that nobody died from the flu and had the temerity to suggest that it's really all my fault for not getting a flu shot. (Nevermind reports saying that this year's flu shot doesn't even deal with the flu strains out there.) So then, I reminded her that she told me that children had died in Colorado from the flu, and that I was obviously next in line. What advice do I get at that point? Don't eat, drink lots of water, and take some tylenol. Gaaaaaaaah.  I also think I have a fever, but my stupid thermometer is quite obviously broken because it tells me that my temperature is only 96.9 degrees. That's definitely wrong, I have a fever of at least 100. (Or it could be because my apartment is so warm, but how does that explain the chills I have too?)  Of course, by the time this illness has run its course, I will have gained 50 pounds because I'm using it as an excuse to eat all the pizza and Lindt truffles I want - and I obviously am not walking anywhere except from my bed to my futon.   And all I want is a vanilla ice blended from Coffee Bean but I *can't 'cause I'm on this wretched coast.   Yes, I'm feeling quite sorry for myself.

      Day 2 of being sick. This really sucks. I swear I'm dying. I am sneezing all over the place, which just means that my germs are just going to spread and cloak my entire apartment - if I don't sneeze my head off first. Maybe the CDC can study my apartment for new diseases after I get better. I am going to have to thoroughly clean, which really is just a form of procrastination so that I don't have to study.   Crankypants expressed suitable commiseration when we talked, and he said if he were here he'd make me chicken soup, which really means he'd go to the market, try to find real chicken soup in the deli, and that failing, buy a can of Campbells and attempt to heat it up without burning it or catching the kitchen on fire. But really, it's the thought that counts. Especially since he totally spread his sick germs to me via phone.  Although, come to think of it, a big bouquet of flowers would be nice about now. But he's not capable of that much thought. I can only hope that the bras I ordered from Victoria's Secret arrive today, so that can be a nice little "present."  Boy, this is going to make clinical diagnosis fun today - at least we have standardised patients, so their lives (hopefully) won't be in jeopardy as I attempt to do a physical on them, hacking and sneezing the whole way through.    And instead of studying for exams (next week, aaaahhh!) in subjects where I have not touched the text (let alone gone to class - class, me, when I can instead sleep in and then watch  Live with Regis and Kelly ?).. I have been downloading songs and making mix CDs for no apparent reason at all.   But more excitement - apparently, my 6 weeks of doing Western blots last summer paid off (boy, was that ever boring. Mix a couple of things together and wait 2 hours, repeat until you feel like shooting your head off - at least I got paid well for playing on the computer and leaving work early. Too well. It's very tempting to do it again this summer, until I remember the mind-numbing boredom. That, and it won't help me in my future career in education/psychology) and I get to be second author on a paper! This is super-exciting, since I recently read the paper and cannot explain it at all. Wow, if I were finishing med school and applying for residencies, this would be so helpful. But I'm not, so really this is just an ego boost. I really have no idea what I was even testing last summer, I just did Western blots on whatever cells they told me to do Western blots on. (I'm not even exactly sure what a Western blot tests, for that matter.) But it is entitled "Proteasome Inhibition Induces Cytokeratin Accumulation in vivo"... I know that ethanol-fed rats were involved, that's it. If you want to read it in all its glory, it will be published sometime in  Exp Mol Pathol  (according to the actual author of the paper), which I can only deduce means Experimental Molecular Pathology. But I'm not quite sure.  All the pretty blots - that is, pictures of blurry lines - are my contribution. Bonus points if you can explain the paper to me in terms I can understand.

      Ever since I started medical school and/or dating crankypants, my immune system just hasn't been the same. (I'm not sure which one I should blame, so both get to split it.)   Until last February, there were only three instances where I was too sick to function. Once was when I was 4 and had chicken pox - and I probably still functioned fine, but wasn't allowed to go to school for an entire day. (I also had 8 chicken pox. That's right. Eight. Or maybe it was six. Whatever it was, it was a ridiculously low number. That is how good my immune system is - oh wait,  was .) Then once in 6th grade, I got the flu and had to stay home. The last time, I was a senior in high school, and that time I think it was psychosomatic, where I made myself physically ill over worrying about getting into college and couldn't get out of bed. So that doesn't really count.  That's it. Two (or three) days of my entire life where I wasn't able to go about my daily business. Otherwise, I'd never gotten anything worse than a mild sore throat. Good enough to whine about, but not good enough to claim being incapacitated.   Then last February, during that big horrible blizzard, I was visiting crankypants. And I Got Sick. Sick as in, achy stuffy runny headachy fevery nearly-on-deathbed. Sick as in, I really shouldn't have gotten out of bed and wouldn't have, except for the fact that he didn't have a TV in his bedroom and I wanted to watch TV, and thus had to park my poor self on the sofa.  To top it off, that stupid blizzard hit, and we couldn't even leave the apartment. I would have called my parents for pity, but didn't want to be yelled at for not bringing my antibiotics with me, as I apparently am supposed to every time I travel. I felt even worse for him, because obviously I 1) am a girl and 2) was too sick to move, so he had to go trudging through knee-deep snow (because of course the snowplows weren't working) to the supermarket, a good mile and a half away, to get food. And he was otherwise trapped in the apartment with a very whiny me. Whiny and sick me is so not a good combination. This is how conversations went:  (Obviously) me: "I think I'm dying." Him: "No, you're not dying. But get back into bed, you shouldn't be moving about." Me (being difficult because it's so much fun): "But I wanna watch TV." Him: "Get back in bed and I'll bring you a book." Me: "I've read  all  the books in your apartment and want to watch TV. I think you should get a TV for your bedroom." [15 second pause] Me: "I think I have a fever, feel my forehead." Him, after putting his palm on my forehead: "Maybe you have a slight fever." Me: "You're doing it wrong, you're supposed to put the back of your hand on my forehead, your palm is already warm. Don't you have a thermometer?" [20 second pause] Me: "I haven't gotten this sick since  sixth grade . This is all your fault. You're germy."  Repeat every fifteen minutes or so.   And since med school/dating crankypants, I have gotten sick - maybe not to this degree, but definitely more than just a mild sore throat sick several times each winter. Coincidence? I think not.   Anyhow, why this all comes up.. I am currently icky and sniffly and sore and feeling very full of pity for myself. And I obviously can't make it to class. As a matter of fact, I should really bring my computer over to my bed and play (ahem, study) from there..

      More things I hate about flying: 1) Getting to the airport 3 hours early because your father is scared that there might be traffic on the way there, but there isn't and you end up with waaaay too much time to spare. 2) How, in 1st class, the seats are still uncomfortable and you can't find a comfy sleeping position and spend the entire redeye tossing and turning and annoying the person next to you. 3) Lugging all my carryons around in an airport. I always end up with a few broken capillaries in my shoulder. 4) THREE HOUR LAYOVERS. 5) The 1st leg of your flight getting in an hour early so that your three hour layover before dawn is now four hours. 6) Watching the sun rise in an airport. There is just something so utterly depressing about it.   On other notes.. I seriously think New England hates me and my car. How else can you explain something bad happening to my car on an annual basis? This time, last year, my passenger window was smashed in. Yesterday, a flat tire. (Okay, that might have been my fault, I might have run over a curb. But for all the trouble I went through, at the very least I wish I could have run over something good. Like a skunk.) Gah. I need servants to take care of all of this for me.  And I have this weak pathetic cough - rather like Ben Stiller's character in  Zoolander  after he goes into the coal mines. Everyone is making fun of me for having such a wimpy non-productive cough. I would make fun of me too, but I feel too sorry for myself. Sniffle.

      I bought these fantastic cards printed by  urlLink Indian Hill Press  at a local shop. They have incredibly witty verses like the following:  If I Had Been At Your Birthday  I might have eaten all your cake. I might have got a belly ache. I might have barfed, you never know. Aren't you glad I didn't go?   The Truth About Birthdays  The presents make your stomach ache, The singing never ends, And someone bakes your favorite cake And feeds it to your friends.   Snail Mail  E-mail rushes to and fro Since paper letters seem to slow, But we prefer the status quo; This card was sent by escargot.  The accompanying blockprints are also very cute, with smiling snails and sad birthday birds. I need to select which lucky people get these little gems.

      Note to self:  Going to the gym for an hour does  not  mean that you can then order a hot dog and onion rings for lunch. You cannot consider this a "free meal", as in that it doesn't contain any calories because you were just sweating your ass off on the elliptical trainer.

      Proving that the cold has indeed warped my mind, I have lately become a fan of country music. Goodbye  urlLink Red Hot Chili Peppers , goodbye  urlLink Buddha Bar , goodbye  urlLink Saint Etienne . Hello,  urlLink cowboy boots and cowboy hats   My new favourite song, which has supplanted  urlLink Jet 's  Are You Gonna Be My Girl , is Brooks and Dunn's  You Can't Take the Honky Tonk Out of the Girl . But seriously. There is just something to the lyrics that stick in your head, and you can't get them out. Yeah, Connie came back from her second cousin's wedding.* First time she'd been home in a year or two Just in time for the rehearsal dinner, That crazy Connie wasn't wearing any shoes.   Chorus  Yeah, she lives in L.A. she flies to New York City; That woman's been around the world. You can take that girl out of the honky tonk, But you can't take the honky tonk, Take the honky tonk out of the girl.  Well, that dinner broke up at around 11:30. Boys went out to do what boys do. Connie said: "Hey girls, let's huddle up. "'Round somethin', 'bout a hundred proof."   Repeat chorus .  Well, at nine a.m., out in front of that church, People goin' nuts looking for the groom. Somebody says: "Hey, by the way, where's Connie?" She's run off with that boy to Cancun.   Repeat chorus .  *I swear, listening to the song, the line is "Yeah, Connie came back  for  her second cousin's wedding,", but the website says "from", not "for". "For" makes so much more sense though. (Lyrics courtesy of  urlLink their website .) I am not even sure what this "honky tonk" is. I think I just like singing it. From what I gather, it seems to be a certain lack of morals and ethics and decency, and a propensity for drinking and trouble-making, as this girl Connie runs off with the groom the night before his wedding. Maybe that's why I like the song so much.    Next thing you know I'll be wanting to learn how to line dance and two step. Then it's all really over.

      I have started a new research project where we look at how the current cholesterol regulation guidelines are being implemented in primary care facilities. It sounds very interesting, n'est-ce pas? Since high cholesterol is an indicator of potential cardiac disease, this is important. You can go to  urlLink  Heartage.com  to enter in risk factors and find out how high your risk is of having a heart attack in 10 years. I am happy to say that even with my high cholesterol and all, my heart is a young 23.   In addition to this high cholesterol, people on both sides of my family have had heart problems in the past. However, I don't feel that I'm going to die of a heart attack. No, that's not the way my life will be ended. Cardiac problems are the least of my worries. What will do me in will be liver failure.  Maybe my next research project should be to figure out one's liver age. Because mine, definitely, is at least twice my real age. Poor liver. At least it can regenerate itself, as long as one doesn't abuse it too much. However, nothing in moderation, not for me!  On a related note, I was in Whole Foods and found these candies called "hangover drops" from The Apothecary's Garden, based in Gloucestershire, England. They promise to help "refresh and revive." They contain sugar, glucose syrup, citric acid, ginseng, natural flavours: bramble, lemon, orange, raspberry, rosehip. They are also coloured by beetroot red. I wonder if they work. If so, this purchase will be worth every cent of the $3.99 I spent on them. My friend Kate is trying them this weekend and said she would let me know. I am very excited by this finding.   Why not the KGB pills? Because Kate is right. I want to feel drunk while I'm drinking, I just don't want to be hungover the next morning. Or day(s), as the case may be.

      Stick 17 people in two cabins, add lots of alcohol purchased in New Hampshire (it's cheaper there, and boy did we take advantage of that), and what do you get? Ahh, if only there had been a hot tub. Or if only it was warm enough to actually jump in the lake. It could have been a lot more disastrous.   We all drove up to the cabins in separate cars, although we were in constant communication as we tried to find the first state-owned New Hampshire liquor store. ("Dammit, we're nearing Manchester and we haven't seen anything yet." "Have you found the liquor store?" "On I-95, they're so much more abundant." "Jackpot!")  After we all congregated there (normal people meet at gas stations and restaurants. We are alcoholics), we drove onto the cabins and started drinking right away. That would mean we started at 5:30.   At 8PM, we all piled into cars and drove haphazardly down the dark little streets of New London attempting to find a place called the Flying Goose Inn. We, naturally, managed to get lost several times, and just proceeded to get drunker at dinner. I feel bad for the poor normal patrons of the restaurant. I'm sure they weren't expecting such a large raucous obviously drunk group.   Then we returned to the cabins and all crowded into the one that had the electrical fire. Then the real games began. Naturally, in mixed company, everyone's favourite drinking game is "Never Have I Ever." It got real dirty, real fast. Actually, I think it started off dirty. Some of the more interesting questions: Have you ever had sex in the school library? Have you ever hooked up with your best friend's sister? Have you ever had sex in a public bathroom? Have you ever had sex with anyone of the same sex? Have you ever had sex with anyone else in this room? Have you ever had sex in the cadaver lab? Okay, only the last one was really interesting. After the cadaver lab question, the game quickly came to an end as we didn't really want to know what else the one guy who had indeed had sex in that room had done. There is not a single clean surface in there. So then we tried some other half-assed drinking games, and it just degraded into talking, drinking, giving backrubs, drinking, guys running out to pee in the frozen-over lake, lots of talk about wombats (I'm not really sure what this alluded to. The guys went out to pee and then came back mentioning wombats over and over. Maybe the cold got to them) and more drinking.  Next thing you knew, it was 3AM.   The night probably would have ended a whole lot differently if there had been 1) a hot tub or other large water source (ie, the lake) or 2) enough rooms so that people didn't have to bunk in the common rooms. Since I was sharing a room with Steph, it's not like I could have snuck a guy up there without her knowing - although there were several mentions of roommate swapping. Several different friends asked me why I didn't end up hooking up with various guys that were on the trip. I still have a boyfriend and all of them know that. If the guys want me, well, I can't do anything about that, can I?  I spent all of today recovering from a hangover brought on by over 10 hours of constant drinking, while everyone went out skiing. I sat by the fire and ate pizza, read magazines, and slept. All day long. It was very pleasant.  I do feel gypped about the whole maple sugar candy idea, however. I, naturally, had bought maple syrup so I could drizzle it on snow just like Laura Ingalls in  A Little House in the Big Woods , but It Did Not Work. I was very disappointed. It appeared to be so easy! Take a plate of snow, pour maple syrup in designs over it. But nothing happened, and we just got maple syrup-flavoured ice. It was very sad.

      Against my better judgement, I've allowed myself to be convinced to go up to  urlLink Mt. Sunapee  in New Hampshire for the night with former classmates. (By some miracle, the male-female ratio on this trip is 3:1, while normally in the class the ratio is 1:3.) Most of them are going skiing. I most definitely am not. There is nothing enchanting about the idea of bundling up with two slats of wood affixed to your feet, waiting in line to ride a lift to the top of a mountain - where it is even colder than at the base! - and then flying down the mountain, adding wind chill to further lower the temperature, blistering your face, attempting to avoid trees and rocks because they  are  your enemy at this point. And then paying for this "privilege"? No sirree, not for me. (Crankypants said the he would also pay good money for a picture of me skiing. The mental image alone was enough to send him into peals of laughter for a good five minutes. Hrmph.) I will be the one sitting sitting in the  urlLink cottage  with a mug of hot chocolate, watching people trudge in from the snow and making fun of them if they're hurt/cold/etc.  However, I  am  indeed excited to go up to the mountains, for two reasons:  sledding  maple sugar candy Sledding is the only winter sport I will participate in. It is safe, because you are sitting, and if you're about to hit a tree, you can just tumble off your sled and the likelihood of your breaking your leg/arm/other body part is much less. Plus, you don't have to pay lift fees, and it takes one back to his/her childhood, if one's childhood involved snow and hills.   And maple sugar candy - I have been dreaming about making this since I read  urlLink  Little House in the Big Woods   in second grade. I was so jealous when Laura got to drizzle warmed maple syrup over snow and make candy that way. I used to dream about doing this at night. There is no snow in LA, and I have not made it since attending college on this coast because urban snow is dirty. So with this trip, I hopefully will be able to realise a long-standing dream. However, I have been warned by numerous people that I am not allowed to eat too much of it, because I have a tendency towards hyperness, especially when there is a lot of sugar coursing through my system. If I become like Ross on that episode of  Friends , there apparently will be a very stiff punishment.   Thus, my packing list so far consists of: Sled (must borrow from someone) Maple syrup Bikini (for potential hot tub action) Camera (for any potential blackmail worthy pictures) Cute snowflake-printed-flannel-lined khakis I am sure I'm missing lots of stuff. Must get to work on this.

      Watching the Golden Globe arrival show last night (I kept thinking they were saying "rival show," and would get periodically confused - what were they rivaling? If I made this mistake once, that'd be one thing - but it kept happening. I am apparently approaching Jessica Simpson-esque stupidity), I have to say: if I were an actress, I would absolutely  hate  those annoying interviewers on the red carpet. I'd just want to walk down the carpet, have everyone take pictures of my pretty dress, wave to my adoring fans and get inside, avoiding the plague that consists of Nancy O'Dell and Lisa Ling (disclaimer: I find both very annoying normally) - they would bug the living crap out of me. First of all, what was Nancy O'Dell wearing last night? It was some horrendous seafoam green satin confection that was massively unattractive. Looked like pajamas from the bottom of the bin ultra-last-clearance sale at Frederick's of Hollywood. And, she is not a good interviewer. I do have to laud her for being able to come up with questions on the spot (or is there a teleprompter at the ready?) but wow, the questions are so obnoxious, the delivery so overly fawning, that if I were being interviewed by her, it would be so hard for me to not slap her. Lisa Ling is similarly fake, and I was so embarassed for Tom Cruise when she talked about how cute his butt was.   But it was fun to watch some of the various actors and actresses, whom I suspect share the same emotions towards Nancy O'Dell (because she is the greater of the two evils), try not to appear overly peeved by her blinding white (obviously veneered) teeth. I wish I could recall some instances here, but the Golden Globes is another good occassion (just like the State of the Union!) to drink.   However, if  I  were in that situation, being faced with the fakeness that is Nancy O'Dell, here is perhaps how I would react:  Q: What will you do if you win the Golden Globe? A: Obviously, rub it in everyone's faces by wearing it as a super-sized pendant.  Q: Do you have any advice for your fellow nominees? A: None. They're the enemy.  (If I were any of the cast members of  Sex and the City ) Q: How do you feel about this being your last season? A: Frankly, I'm glad. I hate the ugly-ass outfits we have to wear, pretending that they're all hip and cool. Don't you think they're atrocious too? Plus, the utter vapidity of the show, sometimes, just kills me. By the way, we all hate each other, and I'll be glad to never see my fellow cast members ever again.  Q:You always look stunning! What's your secret? A: Lots of booze, lots of sex, lots of drugs, a swell eating disorder and a great plastic surgeon.   (If I were any of the cast members of  Will and Grace ) Q: You and your fellow cast members have been nominated so many times in the past, but have always lost. Do you think this year is going to be any different? A: Why, as a matter of fact, I slept with several members of the Hollywood Foreign Press to ensure that we don't win a single award this year!  And I haven't even gotten to the after-party interviews. Make Billy Bush get off the television. And also that Carson guy from  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy . He is entirely too enthusiastic - in a freakish way - and obnoxious about clothes. I think he looks like a scary bird - and he said J. Lo was the best dressed? She looked totally frumpy. Plus he was wearing a pastel pink tuxedo jacket! Make it go away!  And Nancy and Pat what's-his-name? All of them. They should all be banished! Nobody wants to talk to them nor hear their chirpy annoying voices.  Addendum: Gothamist has a much better review of  urlLink what happened last night .

      Instead of being all depressive and morose and pissy about the state of this relationship, I've decided to take a different look at matters. Look, his being a workaholic  could  be a good thing indeed! Eventually, if you marry him, he'll make lots of money. Since you plan on being a professor, this will be very useful. You will be able to use your entire meagre salary on taking care of your  urlLink dog , trips to  urlLink Paris ,  urlLink handbags  and  urlLink shoes . And then you have his salary to decorate the house! And to pay for everything else, of course.  And since he'll always be in the office, you can have your string of cabana boys to entertain you. Nothing wrong with that. What he doesn't know won't hurt him. You can even bake  urlLink cookies  every once in awhile to keep everyone happy.   You wouldn't be settling, you'd be taking advantage of the situation. And then it'll spare any unpleasant break-ups and that icky process of dating.  It really made more sense last night when I was drunk. It also didn't sound as cold and calculating then.

       ... And every time I make plans to visit you, I get the same feeling. That I'm being naggy and whiny and needy, and that I'm forcing you to unwillingly adapt your schedule so that I might be able to be squeezed in...  And perhaps I am being needy in that sense. I need to see you. Maybe I'm a weaker person, but I can't have a relationship that's held entirely over the phone without personal contact. Once a month is hard enough. The last time, where it was two months in between visits, was perhaps one of the harder two month spans of my life. And I don't think how difficult you knew it was for me. I'm not used to it, and I don't ever want to be used to it. I'm not cut out to be a war bride.  ...

      Is it wrong to want all the people you've ever been emotionally/romantically/physically involved with, to remain infatuated/in love with you? Even if you've moved on, ages ago, and never really want them back?  Some people might deem this an act of extreme selfishness. After all, don't you want those others to be happy too? Why would you string them along, giving them glimmers of hope, all the while knowing that you don't ever intend to be anything more than just plain simple friends with them? Cut them loose, allow them to find their own happiness, with - gasp! - somebody else.   But it's rather fun to have the ego stroked. And as long as you don't outright lie to the others, then really, it's not  your  fault. You didn't  purposefully  mislead them. So, perhaps they interpreted things differently. Really, that's their problem. And maybe you should set them straight. But why burst their bubble?  You  don't want to be the one responsible for their ensuing depression.   It's nice to have a string of backups, even if you don't ever plan on using them. They make useful potential weapons of passive-aggressiveness against the current person you're dating.

      I used to tease crankypants and tell him that all his friends were imaginary, because I never got to meet them. Hell, by this point, he's met nearly all the important people in my life.. but I never got to meet his. To be fair, none of them live in LA or Virginia, so it made things sort of difficult. At least, not until recently. This weekend, we drove up to DC to have dinner with his friend Harold.  Harold is definitely a character. He now goes by Will, his given name (Harold being his middle name). Beforehand, crankypants kept muttering to himself, I mustn't call him Harold, he goes by Will now, it's Will. Yeah, that didn't last very long. When Harold/Will met us at the restaurant, it was all, "Harold, how are you?" Harold/Will also "acquired" himself a date (his words) for the night. Her name is Eleanor. She was darling, and sweet, and definitely a sport, since he approached her Thursday night at a bar and said, "You're cute. My name is Will. Want to go out with me, and my friend and his girlfriend this Saturday?" And then her first date with him not only included us, but talk about politics, football, prostitution, engagements rings, and Harold/Will's crazy ex-girlfriends. Many of his stories also centered around instances when he was drunk, or Elliot, their "child molestor" friend. (Elliot has a penchant for girls that are barely 18, and hotel maids.) Yes, every topic that probably shouldn't be brought upon a date, especially the first date.   Also, within the first 15 minutes of meeting him, Harold/Will asked us when we were getting hitched. This kind of talk makes crankypants  very  nervous. It's almost as bad as when he sees ads for tampons and Monistat on television. But did Harold/Will let up? Oh no. As often as he could, he mentioned marriage, living together, our children, and other topics along that vein.  He even prodded Eleanor into ask me about  urlLink one of my rings  and who bought it for me, and when I didn't respond quickly enough, he turned to crankypants and said, "Have you bought her jewelry yet? You've been going out so long! It's time to hit Tiffany's and Harry Winston." The sad truth is that I bought the ring for myself for my birthday last year. Ah, it's really too bad we don't see more of Harold/Will. He is everything that a girl could hope for in a meddling friend.

      Why I like staying in crankypants's apartment:    He has cable. I do not. While I can get along fine with just NBC, there is a certain luxury to watching the  urlLink Food Network  all day long. Between that, MTV, and  urlLink  Mad About You  , there is no reason to leave the apartment. Actually, I just need the Food Network. He thinks I'm nuts when he leaves me watching the Food Network, and returns 3 hours later, and I'm still on the couch watching the Food Network.     He has a toaster. I do not. This does not seem like such a big deal, but seeing that I'm addicted to bread, not having a toaster in my apartment means that I eat less toast, which is good for me. But while I'm here, it's toast all the time. Yummy.    He has DSL. I have a dial-up. I can't validate the cost of DSL just for one person, but he seems to be able to do so.   Weird things about crankypants's apartment:    He has two printers, one laserjet and one inkjet. Why does he need two? I really don't know. He says the one is better for colour printing, and the while the other one only prints in black and white, he can highlight it and the text won't run.   He has an electric hole puncher. That's right. Because apparently a manual one is too much work to operate. This contraption, however, can only punch 15 pieces of paper at a time, and does each hole one at a time. It's a little ridiculous.   He has 8 lamps in his living room. 1 of these is a chandelier, 1 a 3-headed lamp. That means there are 14 light bulbs in this one room alone. When he is present, more often than not at least 2/3rd of the lights will be on. One day, the light bulbs are going to revolt and not turn on. (This is especially strange because for the longest time, in  my  common room, I had Christmas lights and one desk lamp. I obviously did not really study.)   He decided, one day, that the linoleum in his kitchen and bathroom was ugly, and decided to "retile" using large squares of black and white contact paper. He did not cut the squares straight. The end result is a rather warped Alice-in-Wonderland flooring.    For the longest time, he was missing his card table (which serves as his dining table) and a couple of chairs because they were in his trunk. Yes, of his car. When it's nice outside, he likes to drive next door and set up his table and chairs on the front lawn of some university building and study there. There are patches of dead grass on their lawn because he does this often enough, and sits in the same spot every time.  But enough of that. Needless to say, he is a bit of a weirdo. An endearing one, but one nonetheless. We haven't even touched upon his closet yet. Oh dear.

      As I have been whining over the past several weeks, I was stupid enough to schedule two flights back to back, giving me only 3 hours in between them, rather than the day I had expected.   Okay, fine. I was going to deal. This is what happens when you don't have secretaries to check dates for you.   Flight 1a: Los Angeles to Charlotte. It was a redeye. Always painful, but I was in First Class, and therefore had that much more room to toss and turn. And we arrived an entire hour early. Yippee! I got to watch the sun rise in the airport! Always so much fun. In the depressing sort of way.  Flight 1b: Charlotte to Providence. Uneventful, though it was amusing that the pilot was a little late because he got stuck in traffic trying to get to the airport. No matter, we arrived on time (even though we left thirty minutes behind schedule). And my bag was one of the first off the airplane, what a plus!  Best part was having my friend Kate pick me up. Not only did that mean I saved oodles in cab money/parking fees, but then  she  repacked my bag for my next flight. That's right. I threw a bunch of clothes on the floor, and she folded them and neatly put them into my carry-on while I stood in the middle of my apartment being clueless. Who needs servants when you have friends you can pay with lunch? And she even brought me my belated Christmas  and  birthday presents. It was awesome.  Back on the road...  Flight 2a: Providence to Washington, DC. Again, uneventful. Little did I know what was in store for me.  Flight 2b: Washington, DC to Charlottesville - no, wait. Make that Washington, DC... back to Washington, DC.  The flight should have been only a short 20 minutes. The plane that we were flying on was a particularly small prop plane, in that it was only 3 seats across, and even 5'8 me (that's with heels on, of course) nearly brushed the ceiling with her head. About 12 minutes into the flight, the pilot announces something to the effect of "one of the engines is malfunctioning so we're turning back to Dulles." I looked out my window, and what did I see?  The propeller next to my seat had stopped moving.  That's right, the pilot had turned off the engine to keep it from blowing up. Note that the engine was conveniently located next to my seat. That meant if anyone died first,  it was going to be me.   To add to the gravity of the situation, the flight attendant actually made sure we figured out where the nearest emergency exit was, and showed those located near the exits how to actually open them. She told us to prepare for an "abnormal landing," telling us to put away glasses, pens and other pointy objects that could potentially hurt us in a turbulent situation. This included high heels, which of course, I was wearing. Oh well. If anything happened, I was dead anyways, my heels weren't going to make or break the deal. Then as the plane landed, she had us grip our ankles and put our heads between our knees, just like in those little emergency cards located in the seat pocket in front of you. Except this was real.   As with many of my stories, the ending is so much less dramatic than the proceedings. We landed quite nicely and securely, although it was rather discomforting to note that there were four fire trucks and two ambulances, lights ablaze, on our runway, just in case anything happened. Say, in case the engine next to my seat decided that it wanted to explode anyway, just for kicks. I would have been dead, and it would have been  all  crankypants fault for going to school in the South, where normal big planes don't fly.   Then some guy sat next to me while we were waiting in the terminal for a plane switch, and decided to regale me with all the fabulous flights he had been on that went awry. Please, sir, may I have some more?  Flight 2c, this time from Washington, DC to Charlottesville, went fine - once they had refueled the plane after we had all boarded. Ah, it's never too late for a little mishap! The flight attendant was great, though - calm throughout the emergency, and then gave us free alcohol. Since it was such a short flight, there was only so much I could drink. Oh well.  But all is safe and sound, and I'm once again ensconced in the bright den of light crankypants likes to call his apartment. (I just counted. There are SEVEN lamps on, 1 being a chandelier with 5 bulbs, 1 one of those three-headed lamps, and the rest all singular bulbs.) It's a wee bit ridiculous.

      "Have you packed yet?"  It always perplexes me that people ask me this question. They should know me better by now. If by packed, you mean, "is everything you own on a heap in the centre of your room?" then by golly, the answer is yes. But if you actually want things folded and in a suitcase.. well, that's a whole different story. Anyway, as I see it, it's more exciting to pack at the last minute. The pressure! The stress! It's so much fun.  Besides, I have like 9 hours before I leave for the airport. That's plenty of time. It's so much nicer to sit outside and read.   And if I don't pack, then the fact that I will be in  urlLink 4 different airports in 15 hours , one of them twice, so that makes 5 airports overall - and I don't even get to go overseas, dammit! - will just remain an abstract concept. It's a self-preservation technique.  Plus, I hear that it's cold over there on the East coast. The cold and I are not good friends.   It's okay. 7 weeks to Puerto Rico! Where the warm sun and I shall reunite..

      Not quite as wonderful as a Saturday in Paris (really, what can compare with a Saturday in Paris?*), but this past one was spent on the beach in Santa Barbara, with fish tacos. So simple, yet so much fun. And it was warm. As I hear that it's not on the East coast. There might have been a few phone calls made to those on the other coast, to rub in the fact that we were, indeed, on the beach in our bikinis in January whereas.. well, it was butt-freezing cold over there. And we were, yes, in our bathing suits, watching dogs run up and down the beach. Absolutely lovely.   *Perfect Saturday in Paris: Walk to the farmer's market, buy food. Followed by walking from my apartment near the Bastille down through Ile-St-Louis, into the Fifth to do some window-shopping around Rue de Princesse (what a perfect street name!)  Perhaps a visit to a museum if the crowds aren't too bad, find a patisserie for a religieuse, then walk back up through the Marais for some more window shopping. Stop off at the crepe stand near the apartment for a crepe gruyere avec sel et poivre, then make dinner plans. It was idyllic.   What's your perfect Saturday?

      [Warning: This may get a little more personal than you want. But people like reading about other people, otherwise this whole blogging phenomenon wouldn't exist.]  This afternoon, I had hematuria.   Being the good little former med student that I am, and an  incredible  hypochondriac, I decided to research it on the internet. Now, I knew what the cause of it was - probably one of those icky urinary tract infections. My former skank of a roommate in college once contracted a UTI after she had had lots of sex with her then-boyfriend (which, of course, we all got to hear about in gory detail. Poor guy. He must have known he was dating one of the biggest blabbermouths in the world. We  all  knew what was going on in their sex life, down to the last cock ring.) After this past weekend with crankypants... well, yes. Very possible. But still. It was such a... boring disease. So easily resolvable. So I kept reading.  No, it was definitely  not  a UTI, I decided. No sirree. Nothing so pedestrian for me. I settled on the diagnoses of either leukemia or bladder cancer or something particularly horrible sounding called interstitial cystitis, and set about to further research. After discovering that other symptoms of leukemia are such things as easy bruising (check!) and fatigue (check!), well, there we go. It was decided.   By now, I had worked myself up into quite a nice panic.  See, I knew I've had leukemia all along, and nobody listens to me. Nor do they listen to me when I tell them I have a tapeworm, which I do. But mention possible diabetes, and my mother freaks right out. Harumph.  So, I called my mother at the hospital. I love calling my mother at the hospital. They never know where she is, so you get to hear the nurse yelling, "Where is Dr. XXX? Do you know where she is? Her daughter is on the phone. Maybe she's on break, check the break room." Then they put you on hold  without  telling you, which is actually preferable to being transferred to every floor in the hospital as they attempt to figure out where she is. I appreciate the fact that they're super-busy, but I don't think they should be losing track of their doctors like that.   My mom: Hello? Me: Mommy, I think I have leukemia. [long pause] Me, now a little irritated: Hello? Are you there? My sainted, poor mother, who had the misfortune to spawn a pain-in-the-ass like me: Yes. What's wrong? Me, feeling very sorry for myself: I have hematuria. My mom: Okay.  Me, definitely irritated, isn't she worried about me?: So? I think I'm dying. My mom, who has definitely heard this complaint before, and I am  still  alive: I'm coming home soon. Me, even more peeved that she doesn't seem to care: Don't you want to get me medicine? My mom, who knows that I know that we have every antibiotic in our personal pharmacy, the fridge: I'll ask you more questions when I get home.  Since it took her about 40 minutes to get home, I had that much more time to further research my diseases. Oh, not on puny websites like  urlLink Yahoo! health  or  urlLink WebMD , which are quite fine websites - for amateurs. Oh no. I still have access to med school resources, and I pulled out the big guns, accessing the online texts at sites where you have to be enrolled in a medical school or otherwise part of the medical profession to have a password.  Too much knowledge, sometimes, is really a bad thing.  So when my mom came home, the first thing I said was: "I don't have any other symptoms. I think I have bladder cancer." She gave me a long-suffering look, and went through the boring diagnostic questions I knew she was going to ask. ("Does it hurt when you pee?" "How long has this been going on for?" blah blah blah.) and some ones I didn't expect ("Do you have any swelling?" She pulled up my leg to examine it. "You're too tan, you should stop tanning, your skin will lose its elasticity." That's right, a lecture on the perils of the sun  while I'm convinced I'm dying of something horrible )  But then she pulled out the big one.  "Have you had sex recently?"  Now, we're a very private family. We don't EVER talk about those sorts of things. (Not like the aforementioned roommate, who discussed every sexual detail of her life with her mother, and her mother reciprocated. And because roommate is the biggest blabberer in the world, I got to hear all the lovely details too. Like how her mother wrapped herself naked in tin foil for Valentine's day - our  sophomore year in college , ie, not when they were first dating but  recently . I didn't want to be knowing that kind of stuff.) And sure, my mother has certainly guessed by now - after all, I've been dating crankypants for some 18 months now, and she found my birth control (my excuse: It makes my periods regular!), and I spent every weekend, and then some, of the last two summers at his apartment, but we never talked about it. Ever. Hell, I got the birds and the bees lecture from my all-girls school in the 7th grade. I learned about my period in 4th (The video was called  I Got It!  and the only scene that sticks in my mind is when the mother, using pancake batter, draws (pours?) the female reproductive parts. Then the father comes home and they have pancakes for breakfast. I was always distressed by this). None of  that  sort of stuff was discussed by my parents.   I hadn't even told her that crankypants had been in town. (No, she did not question my 4-day disappearance. I do it often. As long as they know when I'm coming back, it's fine.) But I couldn't lie, not when it comes to my health. Or lack thereof. So I had to tell her the truth.  "Yes."   Somehow, she didn't seem very surprised by this, even though it was the first time I had ever openly admitted to it. It's surprising how cool she is regarding this. Or rather, maybe she's in denial and pretending that she didn't really hear my answer. Still, it was way too much for me. At least there wasn't a lecture on safe sex and the like. That, I definitely could not have handled. Rather, she later gave me all the necessary paperwork to go to the lab at the hospital to get urine cultures, and CBC counts, and all sorts of fun stuff.   But, because I am a miracle-child, and am blessed with all sorts of good healthy genes, the problem miraculously resolved itself later in the evening. Maybe something got burst. Who knows. It's a mystery.   But now my mother knows for sure that I'm having sex. And I don't know if I'm okay with that.

      I obviously need to make an appointment with the doc to clean my ears out. When I hear the song "Bandages", by Hot Hot Heat, this is what I hear: ..round, and round, and round and round! Fighter jets fighter jets fighter jets dooo daa daa do Fighter jets fighter jets fighter jets dooo daa doo do ... Don't worry now, don't worry noooow, don't worry now 'cause it's all over now...  Fighter jets!  The corresponding lyrics  actually  are: ...feels like my head is spinning round and round Bandages on my legs and my arms from you... Bandages!  Up and down on my legs my arms from you... Bandages! ... Don't worry now... don't worry cuz it's all under control. Don't worry cuz it will all turn around.  (lyrics courtesy of  urlLink their website .)  That's right. It's not "fighter jets." It's "bandages." And until I learned the real lyrics, I got quite annoying, singing "fighter jets" all the time and demanding to know what song I was singing. But fighter jets  made so much sense.

      Answers that should not go into my personal statement, nor mentioned in any potential interviews:  Q: Why do you want to go into child development? A: Because until I have kids of my own, I want to play with other people's.  Q: Why psychology? A: So I can screw with people's minds.  Q: Why education? A: Uh, because the psych degrees require too much work.   Q: Why do you want to come here? A: The question is, why wouldn't you want me here?  Q: Why did you give up medicine? A: Because it bored me to death.  Q: Why not French? A: What kind of career can you have with a PhD in French? Au pair?  Q: How about international relations?

      Favourite ad of the year (okay, so far)  From A Diamond Is Forever: It's like kissing the ground she walks on. Without actually putting your lips to the cement.  Hm. It's slightly paraphrased. But you get it.

      I'm afraid, that for the next week or so, I'm going to be horribly boring (or even more boring than usual, if that's possible.) No, it's not returning to work - remember, I am not a part of this nation's workforce. If I had my way, I never would be a part of it. I am quite happy being a lazy turdlette, and a life as an academic should put me closest to that.   It's just.. I have nothing to say. Maybe all this laziness has affected my thinking processes, and I have nothing creative to contribute.   Plus, after a great weekend with crankypants, that mainly involved staying in the hotel room with the "do not disturb" sign hanging from the doorknob - oh, and eating, I have to be well-fed at all times.. I've sunken into this depressive malaise that always lasts for several days after we part ways again. It's worse than PMS. Especially since it gets worse every time. And even though I know that I see him in a week - and that I  will  recover from this maudlin state, it takes time.   Until then.. I leave you with my new motto: "Rehab is for quitters." Saw it on a t-shirt at Barneys. If it hadn't cost $80, I would have bought it, too.

      Quote of the weekend: Can we just stick this spoon down my throat, so I can start gagging on it? This is only funny because I didn't say it, but crankypants did, in response to the horrible conversation by the people next to us at dinner. (Yes, we were eavesdropping. But they deserved it, they eavesdropped on us first.) Who knew he had an inner Valley Girl? He's not even from California.

      Why I am glad that it's finally the new year:  The Tournament of Roses and the Rose Bowl are over. The clueless tourists in their rental cars (or worse, RVs) who don't know how to drive are going to LEAVE. They will take down the stadium seating marring the loveliness that is Pasadena. Streets will be reopened, stores will be less crowded, you will be able to find a parking spot in Old Town. Things will return to blissful normalcy.  At least, until Thanksgiving of next year when the entire process starts all over. Sometimes, I'm such a grinch.

      Where did we leave ST, Monday night? That's right, she was all wound up. A flirty statement was taken way beyond its original meaning, and she was left attempting to figure out the best solution. Remember her penchant for melodrama. It's key. ST has a tendency to build things up, and work herself up to the stage where everything is not just on red alert, but the alert-o-meter has broken because it can't go any higher. A desparate plea to her friends was sent, and she went to bed, awaiting answers.  Upon reading her email the next morning, ST realised that her friends were woefully unhelpful. Two examples:   Kevin. ST had wanted the male perspective on things. She had quite obviously forgotten that Kevin is not that breed of male who helps, but rather 1) makes fun of you and 2) generally encourages the wrong plan of attack because he finds it funny. What pithy words of advice did Kevin give her? "You cheater!"  "Bow-chicka-bow-wow!"  "Sleep with him. That's the only thing to do."  "You just want to do it randy English style." "Are you gonna wear a thong bikini?"  Kevin also had the temerity to get Mad at poor ST for not having told him about the TA. When she pointed out that it was a mere date, and did not involve rumpling the bedhseets, Kevin did agree that it was not that grevious an oversight. It was also transparently clear that he was going to be of No Help Whatsoever.    Stephanie. ST was desparately hoping that Steph's advanced years (being five years older) would help to shed some light onto this matter - and hopefully she would come up with a solution as well! Wouldn't that be swell? However, it seemed as though all the skiing has affected Steph - maybe moving at such fast speeds loosens brain cells more quickly. This is what she had to say: So, your directions are as follows: You are to bring your sexiest swimsuit, head on up to whereever it is you're meeting him, and flirt outrageously with him all night long in order to establish the fact that "shockingly flirtatious" was an understatement at best and that, while you are unfortunately taken, you are indeed the most fun woman he has ever been with. You are to drink (but not too much - drinking and hot tubs don't mix well), have LOTS of fun, and then you are to sleep in separate beds as crankypants is arriving in 4 days and while it may seem like a great idea at the time, you certainly don't want to have to deal with guilt this weekend. I think you were BOTH being playful - it would be a shame if the playfulness peaked before you even saw him.    Bear in mind that the above advice uses the following strategy, which I, myself, have employed several times in the not-so-distant past: do everything you can to get a man to fall in love with you, lust after you, want you, etc (whatever the goal may be), and then plead ignorance when it actually happens. "Oh, you feel *how*? Gee, I was just having fun and acting like I always do." Extrication may prove difficult and hurtful. That part sucks. That's right. While there were lots of words, and perhaps it was too early in the morning to be reading emails, and ST was pretty sure she wasn't hungover and confused, she was pretty sure she got the jist of matters - that is, screw with his head royally. While with nearly any other guy, ST wouldn't mind a few mind-games, this might be a wee bit excessive. Maybe she should set Steph up with Kevin, ST thought. They seemed to have approached her dilemna in the same way. That is, from the Most Unhelpful Point ever.  Without any helpful friends, ST was left in a bind. What to do? Aha!  urlLink A friend  (SA) popped up out of the woodwork, ready and available to go out Tuesday night. Phew! ST thought. SA will definitely keep me out of trouble.. unless she gets drunk and passes out.. or my will is too indominable to stop.. ST put an end to these pernicious thoughts, and commanded SA with the high task of Keeping Her Ass Out Of Trouble. (Note: This has never worked before.)  But quickly, matters devolved from the broken-red alert to a more calm and peaceful yellow. To help allay matters, ST sent an email to CBG exclaiming surprise that this wasn't a group outing, since she had already invited SA. (All these initials are crazy!) He called afternoon of outing to arrange plans, and said he would call again when plans were more settled. But he was going to drive out to her hometown! Yippee! Hot tub crisis averted! ST picked up SA and they want to a bar to drink. CBG never called. Angry for her friend (and upon a little bit of urging, combined with alcohol in the bloodstream), SA left a series of increasingly "abusive" messages on CBG's cell phone. Wow, I sure hope that he knows how to pick up voicemail on his phone!, thought ST, since CBG was borrowing his parents' mobile for the night. After all, they might wonder about the "ST is not calling you herself because she says that now you're in a fight" and the "you better have lost all your limbs, your voice, and be unconscious, that's your only excuse, sucker!" messages left on their phone.   Yes, in the end, it was very anticlimatic and a wee bit disappointing. ST felt a little silly that she had worked herself (and everyone else too!) up over everything.  But ST was happy that she had a chance to catch up with SA, and they concluded the night with a late night In-and-Out run. Cheeseburgers and frenchfries at 1AM! It was Perfectly Lovely!  CBG did send an apologetic email the next day. His cell phone had died on him. Alas! Too little, too late. Perhaps another time.  But when a door closes, a window opens. Is that the saying? For New Year's Day, ST woke up and saw that HTA - who had disappeared from the story so long ago! - had left her a text message. Surprise of all surprises! She had not heard from him since September! Perhaps that will be another story, though. It's too much for one night.

      In a week I'll be on the lovely beaches of Puerto Rico. At least, I better be on the beach. Along with crankypants, I've become obsessed with checking the  urlLink weather  in San Juan. I thought this was supposed to be their high season, and that they weren't supposed to get any rain. Unfortunately, the weather reports beg to differ.  The evil thing is that next weekend's forecast vacillates between rain and partly cloudy. Obviously, full on sunshine is preferred, but if that's not to be, then anything but rain. Because if it rains while we're down there, and we can't sit on the beach and tan... there will be some very unhappy, very grumpy campers. Hell hath no fury like a girl who's been spurned her sunshine. Crankypants says that he'll then just paint a sun on the ceiling of the hotel room. I don't know how that's going to help, though. At least, aside from distracting me from the downpour outside as he attempts to be Michelangelo. That'd be worth some laughs.

      I really wanted to know how long I could string this guy along. How long he'd continue to fall for my utter cluelessness. How long he'd continue to believe that a medical student didn't know crap about allergies and what goes into salsa. (Plus, I really didn't have anything to write about this week. Sad that this is the most interesting thing to occur.)   After writing something completely inane along the lines of:  Engineer? Trains are so sexy! Do you make movies about trains? Why do you want to know what year I am in med school? Are you going to do something connecting trains and medicine? I can't think there's very big business in that?  I think he's finally caught on, for this was his response.  Nolo contendere.  Alas. it was fun while it lasted. But that's his fault for trying to teach a (former) medical student about what causes allergic reactions. And, for trying to pick up someone less than half his age. Dirty old stupid man.

      I still have not responded to the post from  urlLink Mr. Literal , primarily because I just don't know what to say at this point.  There are two choices.  I continue the charade of absolute brainlessness, and respond along the lines of "Engineer? I love trains! I think trains are so sexy!" It's really hurting my ego, to pretend to have the IQ of a rock, but the sacrifice might be needed.   I call him out for the moron that he is, and explain that I do know what salsa is, I do know how allergies present (having taken a, yes, 10-week seminar on allergies last year), and that he should stop being a pedophile and stick to people his own age. Oh wait. There's a third option. That I just don't respond. But that's not as fun.   What to do, what to do?

      Kevin is one of my dearest friends. I set him up with all my friends who live in New York, and he takes me out to nice dinners in return. Since he works, it means he's on IM all day long and has time to kill. One day, we were bored and decided that it was high time we created online personals for each other, just because it would be funny. To be fair, we were very honest in its creation and said that I was only looking for a friend, not for someone to date, because if crankypants ever found out, I'd be dead meat. He wouldn't understand the humour behind it all, killjoy.  Anyway, since Kevin was in charge of my profile, he naturally added as many "sly" references to sex as he could. I put the word sly in quotation marks because okay, they're really obvious and anyone with more than 5 brain cells - especially a male with more than 5 brain cells - would understand the reference. For example:  Dude, what's not to love? She's great looking, though she suffers from "crippling arthritis", if you know what I mean...., an amazing cook, great listener, basically knows how to treat a man right. AND she's going to be a freaking doctor! 'Nuff said.  Wow, I love Kevin. He's great with the compliments. I should be dating him, instead of crankypants who will only tell me I look nice when he's tired of my primping and wants to get out of the house. But anyway. The phrase "crippling arthritis" could be taken literally, but it's obviously meant figuratively. I mean, a couple of 20-some year olds are writing this. Oh, but wait. I get all the tools when it comes to my personals ad. The tools who take things too literally. For instance, this is a response I got:   One thing I saw was that your friend wrote about you having arthritis...I've found that what presents as arthritis is, in many cases, a food allergy. I have a friend who is a musician and was nearly stopped in his tracks until he found this out. The two most common allergies that cause pain like this are chicken and belladona-type plants [tomato, eggplant, etc]. I can get you more info if you'd like.  Excuse me? You can't be serious. He actually thought I physically suffered from arthritis. So I checked out his profile. He is a  balding 47-year-old , whose perfect day includes, "bike ride, good food, salsa, and making love to a smart and emotionally available woman." Eww. Not to mention, Kevin had accurately posted that I drink like a fish and smoke occassionally, and this guy doesn't do either of the above. I cringed just looking at the profile. He looked like one of my icky anatomy professors. The short, balding, annoying voiced one. And he obviously can't read between the lines. But the word salsa caught my eye. Salsa. I'm sure he meant the dance, but oh, what if I took it to mean the food? How's THAT for literal? And a clever play on words. So with Kevin's help, I drafted the following response:  Ah. Seeing that my allergy is due to salsa, and you enjoy it so much, it quite simply wouldn't work.  I mean, he had to know that I wasn't taking him seriously, and that I was being a little mean, in the process. But no. Remember, we are dealing with someone who reads words as they are. He must not have done so well in English, having to analyse poems and whatnot, for this is what I got as a response:  Yes, well, that would be salsa -dance-, not tomato salsa.  It can't be. I know that sarcasm is hard to read in email, but seriously. I was at a loss for words. I didn't know how to respond to such inanity. Luckily, that's what Kevin is for. So, at the risk of sounding like an absolute airhead, I replied:  Tomatoe salsa? I never had tomatoe salsa before... I'm not allergic to pasta sauce so maybe I could eat tomatoe salsa. What does it taste like? If it tastes just like pasta sauce I don't think that would be very enjoyable.  I was told that I  had  to leave the "e" at the end of "tomato," even though I found it offensive.   I just can't wait to see how Mr. Literal responds. And that's how I spend my days.   15h20, Addendum.   He hath respondeth. And this is what he says:  Hm, well, most salsas are made with tomatoes, but are not for spaghetti...usually a chopped vegetable combination for putting on some other food or dipping [corn chips] into :-p http://www.hugs.org/salsadex.shtml  And the arthritic presentation does not correlate with classical food allergy symptoms, so you -may- be allergic to tomatoes, and the result is arthritic pain.  How far along in med school are you? I'm a recording engineer, I do mostly location dialogue recordings for motion pictures and TV shows.  I am at an absolute and utter loss for words this time. I mean,  he is taking me seriously . That is problem #1. And the worst problem of all.

      Ever since  urlLink Scarlett Ace  introduced the  urlLink Japanese Chin  to me, I have been head-over-heels, completely gaga in love with this adorable puppy. As a matter of fact,  urlLink this  has been made my new computer background, replacing the former picture of the Greek Mediterranean which had reigned there for the past year or so.   Naturally, I had to look up the characteristics of this darling dog, so I headed over to the  urlLink American Kennel Club  webpage, where you can also download a video of these puppies prancing around in all their magnificent glory. This is what the AKC has to say about Japanese Chins:   In Japan, there are Inu (dogs) and there are Chin. To the Japanese the distinction needs no clarification. Chin are royalty. They are descendants of dogs that warmed the laps of Chinese aristocracy and kept court with the ladies of the Imperial Palace.   Well, obviously I would have a dog like this. It would suit my needs perfectly. I need an aristrocratic dog. Anything less would quite simply not work.    He is sensitive, though, with definite likes and dislikes, but rarely, if ever, does he forget friend or foe.    This is perfect. I am going to train it to bite guys I don't like, and to pee on the shoes of girls I don't like. It's a miniature, and oh-so-adorable, weapon.    It is light and stylish in action.   All the better to model the doggie sweaters I will obviously be buying for it. And I read somewhere else that they only get up to nine pounds in weight. I think that sometimes, my purse weighs more. It will fit rather well in a little carry-on.   A sensitive and intelligent dog whose only purpose is to serve man as a companion. Responsive and affectionate with those it knows and loves but reserved with strangers or in new situations.    It knows its place in life. This is good, I won't have to train it to be obedient. And this also goes back to it being my personal secret weapon. It will primarily love me and do mean things to people I don't like. It's the perfect plan, you see. Over the summer, I used to secretly replace crankypants's computer background with a picture of a  urlLink puppy , before I kindly turned off his computer for the night. He would then bring his laptop into work and boot it up - and then get made fun of when everyone saw the cute puppy pictures. It was great fun. Too bad he didn't take the same point of view. What a spoilsport, sometimes.

      In 11 days, I will be in Puerto Rico. You have no idea how excited I am, especially since this has been the worst winter  ever  in the northeast. I have reached new depths of pale. I look forward to a week of tanning on the beach, reading and  urlLink checking out hot surfers  (just to annoy crankypants).  On my to do list, in no particular order:   Buy sunscreen . Or I could just borrow from crankypants. He has three different kinds! One for his face, one for his body, and... well. I'm not sure what the third one is for.     Lose 10 pounds . Now, this just isn't going to happen. But, it would be rather nice if I woke up one morning to see that my gym-going has indeed paid off. It probably would have paid off if I didn't get onion rings or macaroni and cheese on my way home from the gym. And oops, I might have bought some  urlLink chocolate  while up in Boston. It's okay, I'll quickly get tan, and then it'll look like I've lost 10 pounds. That, and nobody will be staring at my stomach when they can stare at my chest. Guys are so easy.    Figure out if 4 bikinis are enough for 7 days . No further explanation needed.    Buy enough books to last me a week . I already know I'm going to have to bring down a suitcase full of reading material. Thankfully, you can check two bags!   Restring my tennis racquet . I will lump   urlLink buying a tennis skirt   with this also. I don't think I've played tennis in over 5 years. I used to be somewhat good. No longer. It's okay. I've already said that I'm only going to play in flipflops, as that helps my game. Besides, if the ball doesn't come to me, no way I'm chasing it down.   Find a summer job . This isn't actually related to the trip. But I've given myself 2 weeks to get off my lazy ass and write cover letters telling professors that they totally want to hire me for a research assistant job for the summer. Because I'm hard-working and a quick study, and all that jazz. So if anyone knows any psychology or education professors in LA, please let them know about me.    Pack . I hate packing. (Not surprisingly, I generally hate tasks that can be.. um, outsourced, to a help staff, which I don't have yet. Unless my friend Kate counts. She'll pack for me.) It's just  so  overwhelming, trying to figure out what one  might  want to wear in the future. I'm not going to know my state of mind in a couple of days! Therefore, how can I possibly know what I might want to wear?  I know that there are other things that I must do, and they will be added accordingly to the to do list. But it's so overwhelming already.. I could also just fly down there, empty-handed except for my credit cards, and buy everything there. Then I wouldn't even have to make a to do list, as I wouldn't have to prepare for this trip, aside from just looking cute. I've always dreamt of doing that.. just showing up at my destination with nothing but charge cards. I could make it happen, I suppose..

      In a continuing series, another illustrative example of how crankypants and I differ. Him: Congrats on getting into grad school! It ranks very well, too. Me, thinking (a rare occasion, but I'd had a couple of glasses of red wine, and red wine always makes me introspective):  Rankings? Who was even talking about rankings?  Him, continuing: What do your other schools rank? Here, let me look it up on  urlLink US News .. Me, still not having said a word yet:  Wow. I didn't think about rankings at all. Just think, I could have used the rankings as a starting point for applying to grad schools. But no, I did it the hard way, I just randomly searched various universities to see if they had an education school. I am such a moron sometimes. Okay, often. I could have made my life so much easier.  Him: Hello, are you still there? I'm on the website now. Oh look, Madison ranks in the top 20! You mean, you don't apply to schools depending on how mellifluous their name is? But really, I'm a better person, because I don't rely on statistics and numbers to validate myself and the various educational institutions I attend/hope to attend. (That, and US News consistently screws over my alma mater for not having a large enough endowment. Money isn't  everything .) Or, rather, I forget that they exist. Because I am very often clueless and forgetful, and like to do things my way, the harder and more difficult way. It makes life fun.   Another example: Me: I can't believe you didn't watch the final episode of  Sex and the City ! Him: I hate that show. All those girls are so annoying. Besides, I have this oral presentation on the Rehnquist to work on.. Me: They are not annoying. I am going to buy all 6 seasons on DVD, and make you watch them with me.  Him: Ergh. Me: How's the report coming? Him: I've read the book, it's just getting thought down on paper.. Me: You know what I used to do undergrad, and it worked every time? Him: Smile blankly and nod? Me: That is definitely the meanest thing you've said all night. No, have a couple of drinks. Just enough to get you tipsy, so like three or four drinks. I found that then, my French just flowed so fluently.. Yes, I'm such an alcoholic. A clueless alcoholic, even. But I'm okay with it.

      Rah! I got into  urlLink grad school !  It's extra-exciting because I sent in the application less than three weeks ago. I'm glad that they want me so.  Problem: It's not my first choice. And they want a response in 3 weeks, which is approximately 3 weeks before my first choice (which will remain nameless because I don't want to jinx it) will get back to me. And first choice is most definitely not going to be nice and tell me now if I have gotten in, because they are just like that. Stupid school. For 6 years, I've made fun of people who go there, and now I want to join their ranks. Bah.  Maybe I should just say yes to this place, because quite obviously,  they  definitely want me there.

      For many years now, I have been planning my convent. Now, this isn't a convent by your standard Catholic definition of the word. Oh no. It's  my  convent, and that means I get to set the rules.  First of all, it is going to be on Malta. Why Malta, you ask? Because, it is an island in the Mediterranean and has mostly good weather. It wouldn't do at all to have a convent in a place where it rains. That would just be a bummer. Plus, the dollar can go far there. At least, this is what I think. And it is isolated enough so that there is the illusion of seclusion. But, it's easy flying to continental Europe.   Habits will be redesigned by... I don't know, I haven't yet figured that out. I was thinking something nice and ocean blue-y, flowy, in a couple of styles. Perhaps a nice strappy sundress, and then a tank top/pareo outfit, and then a linen tunic of sorts. All in the same colour, of course, for that illusion of uniformity. Rather like my high school uniform. But in different styles, because not everyone's body shape is the same. And you have to account for differences. Flip flops will be the footwear of choice.   Naturally, boys will not allowed to be a part of the convent. If they want a similar setup, I have several male friends who have offered to start nearby monasteries, so guys can go there. We might have monthly mixers, depending on how cute the others are.   However, since we will need help, there will be a poolhouse of sorts where we will keep the cabana boys and butlers and other manservants. You don't expect us to clean the grounds by ourselves, do you?   Days will be taken up by reflection poolside, meditation on the beach, and peaceful walks around the orchards. Trips to the rest of Europe will occur on a monthly basis, depending on how crappy the weather is on the island and how bored we are of each other.  Crankypants snorts with laughter every time I talk about my convent, which is approximately every time I get mad at him. I start researching properties, which just sends him into greater peals of laughter, and he says, "That's not a convent, that's a bordello." But I beg to differ. In a bordello, you pay for sex. In my convent.. well, there is obviously no such thing. No paying for sex. That's just.. uncouth. I told him if he was lucky he'd get to be a poolboy.

        Apples : Are only good when they're straight from the tree. Apples that have been sitting in supermarkets are not as flavourful, and therefore not worthy of eating. Plus, they only taste good when spread liberally with peanut butter.   Pears : So hard to find good ripe ones. Either they're too hard, or too mushy. Plus, the skin is too thick, so you have to peel them to enjoy them.   Oranges : I love oranges, but I hate peeling them. I don't like it when the pith gets stuck underneath my nails. My mom used to peel oranges for my lunch. I wouldn't eat them if she didn't. I miss when my mother made lunch for me. (Oh wait, she does, every summer when I'm home again.)   Bananas : Are mushy. I hate mushy foods you can squash against your hard palate. Plus, my father made me eat two a day when I was little because it was good for me. Therefore, just like milk, I avoid bananas like the plague. Unless they come with ice cream on top.    Mangoes : See "oranges." Add cutting to the "hate peeling" sentence. But when I go home, my mom cuts a big bowlful for me every day. Then I lay in my hammock and eat them and read a trashy novel. It's rather pleasant.    Persimmons : See "oranges" and "mangoes."    Pineapples : See "oranges" and "mangoes" and "persimmons". Add, hard to find really good ones.    Grapes : I will only eat the green seedless ones. The purple ones aren't as good, and the ones with seeds, while the best, are too labour-intensive. I will only eat them if someone peels the skin for me and removes the seeds, as my mother did when I was really little.   Starfruit : I will happily slice and eat these. But they are very hard to find.   Watermelon : See "oranges" and "mangoes" and  "persimmons" and "pineapples"   Honeydew : See "oranges" and "mangoes" and "persimmons" and "pineapples" and "watermelon."   Cantaloupe : A melon I don't actually like, because it sometimes has a funny texture and taste. And it's ugly on the outside. It creeps me out.     Cherries : Since buying Ranier cherries, which are like little bits of candy, I have been spoiled. No more normal Bing cherries for me. But Ranier cherries (which are this lovely colour of yellow and blush red) are expensive, and harder to find.   Strawberries : I like these. But I rarely eat a whole box. So they all go to waste. So to prevent this, I don't buy them.   Kiwi : The seeds get stuck in my teeth. I like the white centre, though. The green flesh is always sour. I have come to the conclusion that I don't eat fruit because I am so damn lazy. This is probably not a good enough reason. But at the same time, it just goes to show that I need servants to prepare my fruit for me so that I'll eat it.

      An example of how I think:  Crankypants says: "I called Elliott, and he's really excited to see us in Puerto Rico. He wants to surf and play tennis." I immediately think:  Shit, gotta run to  urlLink Lilly Pulitzer  and check out what  urlLink tennis   urlLink skirts  they have.   That's right. Lilly Pulitzer. Not Nike, or Adidas, or something sporty.  Lilly Pulitzer , for crying out loud.

      One day, I announced proudly to crankypants: "I've started taking multivitamins." Now, this was a big step for me. Since I started college, my parents have sent me off to school with a large bottle of multivitamins, and I was previously very successful in forgetting that I was supposed to take them. I would leave them near my makeup. I would leave them next to my computer. I would leave them next to my bed. But no matter where I left them, I'd overlook them. But since finding out that I should start taking folic acid before I even think of having children, in order to prevent neural tube defects, I've been very diligent in taking my multivitamins. Yet, somehow, crankypants wasn't as proud of me as he should have been, replying, "Well, if you eat a balanced diet, you don't need multivitamins."  What a party pooper. I gave him a withering look, and he remembered who he was talking to. I am not good at eating a balanced diet. As one of my favourite quotes goes: "It is a difficult matter to argue with the belly since it has no ears." (Cato the Elder) I eat what my stomach dictates. I never deny a craving, and believe me, I have many of them. This illustrates perfectly one of the fundamental differences between us.   For the first time, I went grocery shopping with him yesterday. Previously, anytime we've actually gone to the market, it was to arrange a picnic lunch on the beach, which consists mainly of shrimp cocktail and lots of cheese. I've never seen what he really buys in a market.   Needless to say, I love shopping for food in the market - primarily because it involves my favourite hobby - well, more a career, really - shopping. I never have a shopping list, which is always a big mistake. The only things I buy with consistency are orange juice and eggs. Let me loose in a nicely arranged place like Whole Foods, and I guarantee I will leave with at least 4 or 5 absolutely useless items, such as marcona almonds. Oooh, white truffle oil. Yummy, peach nectar. And what are these, French nibbling cookies. Definitely a must-try. I wander the aisles aimlessly, randomly putting fun things in my basket. And I never really end up with anything substantial, such as, oh, milk or cereal, but rather different types of granola and at least 5 kinds of cheeses. And you'll be lucky if I leave with anything healthy such as vegetables or fruit.   Now, grocery shopping with crankypants is a very different experience. He definitely has a shopping list tucked away in his head. And I just marvelled at how he passed up fun things like microwaveable chicken nuggets and Terra blue potato chips. The most unhealthy thing that he had in his shopping cart was the Krispy Kreme doughnut that  I  had put in there for later snacking. He bought lots of fruit, lots of vegetables, some breakfast foods, milk, and other similarly healthy and practical stuff. It was quite remarkable. I was simply in awe. He  does  eat a balanced diet. And when I pointed this out to him, he seemed rather surprised, as if he hadn't thought about it before. This explains the lack of snack foods in his apartment. It's not that he's avoiding them, it's just that it doesn't cross his mind to buy them. I am dating a robot. Who  doesn't  snack? It's just not human.  Then I made him clean out his fridge, and it made me feel better, somewhat. He doesn't throw anything away. Thus, he has a fridge that contains such things as: 10 different cartons of blueberries, each with about 4-5 blueberries left. Three boxes of Aunt Jemima pancake mix, each with approximately 1/4 cup of mix left. About 2 bites left of a bagel. Lemonade, from when I had massive lemonade cravings  back in September . So on, and so forth. His fridge was absolutely packed, and he lives by himself. We filled up two large trashbags with the random mostly-empty cartons in his fridge. (Plus, I'm anal about how one's refrigerator is organised, and had to redo his. It looks much better now, in my humble opinion.)  I just came from the market. Random purchases today include pumpkin-filled tortellini, garlic flavoured olive oil, and overpriced but tasty  mache . At least my fridge is filled with more interesting foods than his. Even though it's not a competition, it still makes me feel better about my erratic purchases.

      After watching the  Gilligan's Island  marathon on TV for the past 6 hours, I have determined that I am madly in love with the Professor. He is so cute. And so smart. What is his real name, though? I couldn't go by Mrs. Professor. That would not do at all.

      Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like, being in a normal relationship. One where you see the person you're dating more frequently than once a month. Funny, that the first real relationship I'd get myself into would be long-distance. (It says something about my wariness of commitment.) Sure, we have summers together, but that's only about a quarter of the year. The rest of the time, it's all about me procrastinating on packing, accumulating frequent-flier miles, having my skin break out from flying, and lugging suitcases hither and thither. And when I have to pack up to leave at the end of a visit, I always muse about how  nice  it would be if we actually lived in the same city. Or even just within an hour of each other, rather than 500-or-so miles. It would mean I could throw stuff in a car instead of stuffing it into a suitcase.   But, somehow it works. He's anally compulsive about doing work. Me, I'm soooo not. My idea of "hard work" is looking at my books for an entire thirty minutes without interruption. Then I'll pat myself on the back and read magazines for the rest of the day. I'll go to the library with him, bring stuff to work on, and instead end up reading the newspaper, playing online games and emailing friends asking if it's time for a study break yet for the next three hours. Sometimes I'll even just fall asleep, to his great amusement. If I were living in the same city with him while he's in law school, I think that I'd shoot him and end up breaking up with him, because I wouldn't be able to stand the constant studying. It's admirable, his devotion to his work, but greatly annoying at the same time.   And I don't know what I'd do with him around all the time. Sure, during the summer it's fine. I adapt, and I love it. But I enjoy having my own life too much. And I know myself, that all-too-easily, I'd become wholly absorbed by him and not see anyone else. Sure, it would be easy enough to counter that - but at the same time it's even easier to have him be my main playmate. If I need to go to dinner with someone, I know he'll be there. If I want to go to the beach, he'll be there. So on, and so forth.   So, it works right now. As annoying as the travelling is, as much as I hate packing, it works.   It's another year before he's done with school, and we're both back in LA. And then, at that time, we'll see where things are. But I've been promised, that as soon as I find a place that lets me have a dog, he'll buy me a  urlLink little   urlLink white   urlLink fluffy   urlLink dog  that we can bring to  urlLink brunch . You have no idea how excited I am. I'm already thinking of names for it. Since I'm not allowed to name it Fifi or Princess, I've decided that Charlie is sort of cute.

      I have a longstanding problem with guys with 4-letter names. Whether it's their given name (Paul, Seth) or a nickname (Mike, Jeff), it's just not going to be a good story in most instances.  Now, amongst all these various 4-letter names, the worse one is Nick. I have the most complications with Nicks. Let's give some examples.  Nick #1. I met him my freshman year in college, he was the best friend of one of the guys in the dorm. He did not go to my fine university, but rather a wretched one an hour away, which was close enough so that he was down in my neck of the woods fairly often. It was one of those so rare instances of a semi  coup de foudre . Translated literally, it means lightning bolt, I think. But really, it's that charge you get when you set eyes on another, and just  know  that something is going to happen. And yes, it did. We hooked up, off and on, for over 2 years before I decided that I was tired of it, that I was no longer attracted to him. He was a great guy, one of my favourites in the world, but I just wasn't into it anymore. That's okay, that didn't stop me from still hooking up with him when I was drunk enough to be in the mood. He came to visit me in Paris, he offered to break up with his girlfriend for me, he ended up breaking up with her after we slept together for the first time our senior year. (Note: I was really stinking drunk and wanted to see if he'd actually really cheat on her. Their relationship was on its last legs, anyway.) He's brought up the idea of marriage jokingly, yet with a certain underlying hint of a true proposal.   6 years later, he is still in love with me. When I went down to New York for his birthday party, for some stupid reason I was delegated with the duty of getting his drunken ass home, and he tried propositioning me yet again ("I have an inflatable queen-sized air mattress." To be fair, he had just moved to NY the week before.) It's become a long-standing joke between me and my friends. I was his first love and he will love me forever. It's rather heart-warming to know, but still. It just makes things a teensy bit weird when we hang out together.   Nick #2. He was actually Nick #1's best friend in college. We met in Paris, when we were both studying abroad. Nick #1 did introduce us, and when he left, said, "Be nice to Nicky. He needs friends here." (Nicky, to distinguish him from Nick. It gets confusing, after awhile.) Little did he know that Nicky and I would become fast friends. He had a little bit of a metrosexual vibe going on, and would drag me on my lunch breaks over to vintage designer consignment stores. He would sleep over, platonically, after late nights out on the town. We talked for hours at a time about relationships, dreams, life.  He was, seriously, the Harry to my Sally. Then senior year, actually a couple of weeks after I slept with Nick #1, both Nicks were in town visiting. I had a small very drunken party, and after we ran out of alcohol in my apartment (a very hard task, believe me), we decided to walk (okay, stumble) down the street to another bar. Along the way, we had a conversation that sort of went like this:  Me: "You know, I always thought you were really cute." Him: "The same here. Too bad nothing happened in Paris." Me: "Yeah, it really is. But you propositioned me  the day after Nick left . It was just bad timing." Him: "Yeah, that wasn't too smooth, was it." Me: "Ah well. Missed opportunities.." Him: "Well, there's no time like the present.."  And that was the end of that conversation. But that doesn't mean it was over! No sirree. We went to a bar with everyone else. We drank lots. We closed out the bar. We walked home. Nick #1 offered to walk someone home, and said that he'd call us after to see where we were. Nicky and I walked back to my place. We lay down in my bed. Dum de dum dum. After about 15 minutes of just talking, Nicky was like, "You think he stayed over at her place?" "But he was going to sleep over here, I thought." We both paused. Then nearly simultaneously, we put our cell phones on silent, and perhaps got naked and rumpled the sheets somewhat. Breakfast, the next morning with everyone else, was perhaps a bit awkward, although nobody asked us what happened. After all, he used to sleep over at my place all the time and nothing ever happened. What would've made this any different?  Surprisingly, this didn't hurt our friendship too much. We never talked about it afterwards. He left to play soccer in Budapest, and we still talk as often as we can. I don't know if Nick #1 ever found out about that night, because we swore that we weren't going to tell him as it'd just hurt him. But nevertheless, there is still some hint of an underlying sexual tension there (did I mention he played soccer? His body is amazing), which is only vaguely uncomfortable in certain instances, such as when we were having dinner with his family and he described, in rather great detail, how great I would look in this Charlie's Angels-esque flight suit he and another friend bought for me.    Nick #3. Now, this one came out of the blue. He was my successor at the newspaper, and I thought that was the end of our relationship. But of course my life is not that boring. Last night, I was out with a friend at a law school party. We ran into the former roommate of Nick #3, who had also worked on the newspaper. He was like, oh, yeah, you were Nick's boss. You know, he was in love with you. You could have thrown me for a loop. My jaw dropped, I was just.. utterly stunned. The friend continued: Yeah, he had certain issues, that go back to his family, about women in authority positions and really, if he said bad things about you to me, it was only because he didn't know how to handle his feelings for you. Seriously, I had no idea what to say. I didn't even lead this guy on! Doubtful I'll see this Nick again, but yet, it was still slightly disconcerting.  Moral of the story: I am apparently irresistable to Nicks. That's 3 out of 3. If your name is Nick, and you want to maintain your sanity, and help me maintain mine, stay far, far, far away.

      A couple of weeks ago, I sent crankypants a mind-brain quiz that determined what kind of thinker you are. We scored the same (even though I'm right-handed and he's left, apparently we're both right-brain thinkers, etcetc.) Today, we exchanged Valentine's day presents (yes, early, but I had his shipped to him and apparently not being able to open the package taunted him). We got each other monogrammed flasks.  I'd say that great minds think alike, but it's just too weird at this point. My friend Kevin has said that we're not allowed to ever get married because married people should bring different things to a relationship. We apparently share a brain, now.  Besides, I'm special and simply fabulous, and highly individualistic. He can't be like me. There can't be two mes in this world. It would spontaneously combust.

      When will it be spring? I have  so  many new cute clothes to wear, not to mention at least half a closet of old* skirts and tank tops and sandals. Yet here I am, bundled up in scarves, pants and boots, and I am sick of all of them. How utterly miserable. Not to mention that winter clothes take up more room in a suitcase, ergo I actually have to plan what I pack instead of emptying half my drawers into my bags. Where is my personal staff, that includes a wardrobe consultant, a person to pack my clothes, and a person to carry my suitcase, when I need it?  *old, according to my personal definition, means that I've worn it at least 3 times.

      Since I decided to be a good American citizen, I sent away for my absentee ballot. However, as always, when it comes to the goverment they have to make matters as confusing as possible.   On the front, the booklet says "Official Absentee/Vote By Mail Ballot." It contains one official ballot card, one official ballor card secrecy sleeve, and one ballot return envelope (which is a lovely shade of lavendar. Why lavendar? It is so.. un-governmental.)  On the inside, it says, "as a cost savings measure this condensed voter booklet has been printed as an absentee ballot voting guide only. Your Official Sample Ballot and Voter Information booklet with information pertaining to local candidates and measures is being mailed separately." This took me a long time to process. If the "Official Sample Ballot and Voter Information booklet" was being mailed later, then what did I receive? What is this guide? Does this mean the real ballot is coming later? Or is this the real ballot? After musing on this for 15 minutes, I realised that they were going to later send me this big honking booklet with everyone's high school-esque "Why you should vote for me" essays. However, I don't see how this saves money, having to mail two separate books. Just print it all in one. Also, now I have to wait before I can fill in the little bubbles (what happened to chads?)  Also, there are four blank pages that just say "Go to next page" with a big arrow. I'm not sure purpose this excess waste of paper serves.   Also, the main reason for my sending away for the primary election absentee ballot was to vote in the national primaries. I want my guy Clark to have my vote. Not that he's even still in the race. Stinkyhead. Yet I apparently only get to vote for people running for county positions. I am very confused. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm a nonpartisan voter, so that I can do things like vote Republican for Governor of California (no, it was not Arnold. The guy doesn't even speak English properly.) But I don't know the difference between all these people running, and will probably just end up filling in bubbles because I like the candidate's name.   I really should take this more seriously. What if I want to run for office some day? I think I would make a great judge. After redoing the ugly robe, of course.

      As a continuation of the  urlLink previous post , I'd like to further illuminate how my friend has one of the sweetest boyfriends ever.  I told him to definitely not get her a Kitchenaid mixer, and sent him several links to other sites, including some  urlLink purse   urlLink sites  and a couple of  urlLink jewelry   urlLink sites . Nothing special, just places I like, and my tastes vary so much from my friend's that I wasn't even sure if these would be useful.  And this is what he wrote in response: I'd like to say that your talents were truly wasted by medical school. HOW COULD YOU HAVE SPENT TWO YEARS DOING THIS STUFF when you're so adept at the fashion world, pulling out designer jewelers that I couldn't have found if I'd googled for years.  These ideas will last for longer than v-day...which is great because I always need insight into the woman's mind. (We all know it's a scary place for a guy to explore).  I especially liked boucherjewelry.com...will have to get her next b-day present from here. Mad props to you for being the connoisseur of all things nice.  Crankypants doesn't know what he's got, does he? Seriously. He has now supplanted  urlLink Harold  as my new favourite person. It only takes a bit of flattery. I'm easy like that. As does alluding to the fact that crankypants is an ungrateful wretch (although I apparently have the best V-day present from him ever, according to another friend. We'll see).

      This is what my friend's boyfriend is doing for her for Valentine's Day:  First, he asked me to call her up for dinner Thursday. Except that he will show up, a day earlier than expected, rather than me. She is obviously not expecting this at all. She will love this surprise.  Then, for Valentine's day breakfast, he's going to make her fried eggs with heart-shaped egg rings, and pinkish cranberry muffins. He writes, "If you put a baking marble into the muffin pan and use a cup-cake liner, they turn out in the shape of hearts!" He is so excited about this. It is too cute. I'm going to cry, and not just because I'm hormonal.   Then he wanted to get her a Kitchenaid mixer, red for Valentine's Day. While she is a woman of many talents, one of them does not involve cooking. She would have hated this present, wondering if he wanted her to be more domestic.   It's good to know that he's not perfect. Even if I am positively dying with the utter sweetness of his surprise early arrival and the heart-shaped breakfast.

      It is very fortituous that I was set up with crankypants, because I am a spectacularly bad candidate to be picked up in a bar. When I go drinking with friends - that's exactly what I want to do. Drink with friends. Usually, all my friends are of the same mindset, so this works. I don't want to talk to strangers - even though I am all cute and animated and fun, that's because I'm talking to people I like. Not people I don't know. And people I don't know should  not  attempt to butt in on the conversation, because I don't want you to be a part of it. Maybe if you're Kelly Slater or Owen Wilson. Then you may be allowed to add your own opinions. But if you're not, then please go away. If you don't know me, you will not understand the sarcasm that is so much a part of my being. And then I'll seem mean. I'm not really mean, but you don't need to know that. I just don't want to talk to you.  Friday night, we were at a  urlLink bar  somewhere in the East Village or LES, I never remember the difference.  I was catching up with an old high school friend, and we were having fun gossiping about people. Then, in my peripheral vision, I saw this tall hovering figure who looked like he wanted to join in on our all-girl fun. We kept our circle closed, so that he couldn't find a chance to participate. Then there was a lull in the conversation, and he made his move.  "Have you been to Spain?"   What in the world is he talking about?  I thought. We definitely were not talking about Spain. We were not in a Spanish-themed bar. And I certainly was not talking to him. But I couldn't be outright cruel and ignore him, although I wanted to. I like to maintain some pretense of manner. So I answered his question.  "Yes."  Short, sweet, and to the point. Also, it did not encourage further discussion. Which was the idea. But of course he didn't take the hint.  "Where?"  Ratbastard, he wanted a conversation. I wanted to talk to my friends. Two different goals. No compromising.  "Madrid and Barcelona." "Oh, Barcelona! My band performed there New Year's Eve."  Big whoop. Really, really, really, I didn't care. It was 3AM. And he wasn't one of the aforementioned celebrities. I sent my friends imploring looks, desparately asking for help. But they were too amused, evil people, to be of any use.  "Oh. What instrument do you play?" "The guitar." "Cool."  Waaah, get me out of here! He definitely wasn't American, while his English was gramatically perfect, as was his pronounciation, it was also a little too staccato - like the way Germans speak English. Maybe Germans don't understand my curtness. Damn. There was a long pause - I'm sure that he was thinking of another question to ask, so I turned back to my friends, closing the circle to outsiders. This did not stop him, however.  "Do you want to see my wine skin?"  I kid you not, that was the exact sentence that came out of his mouth. Wine skin. It sounds vaguely dirty. Could be fun. But it wasn't, it was just a wine skin. Who carries around a wine skin? Apparently, Germans do.   "Cool."  I attempted to close the circle again.   "Would you like a drink? A nice glass of ice water, perhaps? They serve a wonderful ginger ale here."  I must have heard wrong, but my friends confirmed that that's indeed what he said. But an offer of water or ginger ale? Maybe they have a second meaning in his mother tongue. Whatever it was, I didn't get it. Plus, that's not the way to entice me. I like  real  drinks, as befitting my alcoholic status.   "No, really, it's okay. I already have a drink."  And with that, I was determined to close the circle a third time. And it worked. Sort of. He just kept hovering behind me, like a bad version of my conscience. He was no more than 10 feet away from me the rest of the night. I couldn't shake him. And every once in awhile he offered to get me a drink.   Perhaps I could have been friendlier, it wouldn't have killed me. But that's not the kind of person I am, especially if I am in a I-want-to-catch-up-with-friends mood. Which I definitely was. There was no talking to new people. I'm not a friendly person to random unconnected strangers.   Sometimes, I really wonder how I make friends.

      Last night, a friend and I went to see  urlLink Wicked  at the Gershwin Theatre. It is based on the eponymous book by Gregory Maguire, which tells the story of Oz from the Wicked Witch of the West's point of view. The book and musical are very different, however, although the latter was inspired by the former. When I read the book last month, there was no way I could have seen a muscial based on it if it was a close adaptation. However, the musical was a very fluffy and light take on the book, many details different and "Disney-fied" to make it an entertaining and lavish production. (I actually dont' know if Disney had anything to do with the musical.) The leads' voices were simply quite amazing, though. Amazing. They made the show worth it.   My pet peeve, though, is that standing ovations have become rote. I really think that they're rather overdone. Every performance does not require a standing ovation. I did a search on "standing ovation etiquette" on the web, and unfortunately every site says "standing ovations are cool." Yes, they are. Yes, the cast probably enjoys them. However, I was raised to believe that one only stands while applauding when one is absolutely blown away by a spectcular performance. Oh wait. I found a  urlLink site  that agrees with me: Applaud an especially fine scene or individual performance only in cases of rare "show stoppers," and reserve standing ovations for truly outstanding perfomances. If this McGraw-Hill Ryerson school wasn't in Canada, I would send my future children there. The fact is, now that people always give standing ovations at the end of each performance, the cast has come to expect them, as if it's their due. That shouldn't be the case, and it rather annoys me.  Plus, the only reason I give standing ovations now is that every single other blasted person is standing, and I can't see the cast anymore. That's annoying too. As were these wretched people sitting behind us, with the most godawful nasal voices that just  projected . Combine a southie Boston accent, a Cockney accent, and a Queens accent all in one horrible voice, and that's what we had to sit in front of. Of course the woman kept a running commentary throughout the production. Obviously everyone wanted to her her exclaim, "This set is the most expensive ever! How much did you think it cost? 10 million?" or "You paid $4 for this bottle of water? That's over $5 Canadian! I would have rather gone thirsty." Yes, go thirsty and let your thoat dry out so you can't screech anymore. Maybe she's the Canadian version of a weapon of mass destruction. I'd surrender in 3 minutes if I had to listen to a steady stream of that voice.

      While perusing  urlLink NewYorkish , I came across a mention of a  urlLink dumb law fining flirting . My interest was immediately piqued. I dashed on over to  urlLink Dumb Laws  to check it out. Given that I'm headed to New York in a few scant hours, I wanted to see what is actually technically illegal. I actually think that some of these dumb laws are valid and should be enforced. Such as the following:   A fine of $25 can be levied for flirting. This old law specifically prohibits men from turning around on any city street and looking "at a woman in that way." A second conviction for a crime of this magnitude calls for the violating male to be forced to wear a "pair of horse-blinders" wherever and whenever he goes outside for a stroll.   Can't you see it now? A whole state of men with horse-blinders on? It would be great. I would also like to be on the committee that defines the phrase "at a woman in that way."    While riding in an elevator, one must talk to no one, and fold his hands while looking toward the door.   I hate people who feel compelled to make small talk. Indeed, sometimes, silence is golden.  Specific to New York City: It is illegal for a woman to be on the street wearing "body hugging clothing."   All of NYC would be fined, then. And what about men wearing "body hugging clothing"? Sometimes that's even more repulsive.   Intrigued, I decided to check out what laws I could be breaking in my current city, Providence.  Any marriage where either of the parties is an idiot or lunatic is null and void.   I just thought this one was funny. I would like to know who determines the idiot/lunatic status.   Exercising any labor, business, or work, or using any game, sport, play, or recreation, or causing any of the above to be done to or by your children, servants, or apprentices on the first day of the week (Sunday) results in a penalty of $5 for the first offense and $10 for the second.   This perfectly excuses my lazy Sundays spent in front of the television.    You may not sell toothpaste and a toothbrush to the same customer on a Sunday.   Because apparently wanting people to have clean teeth is a bad idea.   Not terribly interesting, but quirky. There are bound to be better dumb laws in Los Angeles, let alone California. Let's look there.  Sunshine is guaranteed to the masses.   Amen to that! Who can we sue when it rains or is overcast?  Special to Carmel:  Women may not wear high heels while in the city limits.   I always wanted to move to Carmel. It had such a pretty name. Carmel-by-the-Sea. So idyllic. But no longer, not if they're enforcing this stupid rule. If I want to have a bad back by the age of 35 due to stilettos, that's my right.  Special to LA:  It is illegal to cry on the witness stand.   I wish I knew why. Swaying the jury, perhaps?  Another LA:  Toads may not be licked.   What, they don't want girls finding their princes? Oh, I guess there's nothing about kissing a toad. As long as you don't use tongue.  In Pasadena:  It is illegal for a secretary to be alone in a room with her boss.   I find this priceless.   In San Francisco:  Persons classified as "ugly" may not walk down any street.   This is perhaps my favourite law ever. Who defines "ugly" though? I want to be on that committee also.  And one last one, in Virginia:  If one is not married, it is illegal for him to have sexual relations.   Okay, two:  Not only is it illegal to have sex with the lights on, one may not have sex in any position other than missionary.   Well, well. Every time I visit crankypants, I'm breaking the law. But it's such a fun one to break.

      Because I have decided that I don't have enough on my plate (3 part-time research jobs in addition to mothering whiny francophone children), I decided to volunteer to interview prospective students for my university. This should be lots of fun. Prospective students view this as very important. I know that I did. In retrospect though, you know that it's nothing more than a crock of shit process to let the school know that you are Very Interested in them, interested enough to make this effort. I plan on lots of mind games ("Oh, I can only interview you if you can show up in 10 minutes at this sushi bar. If not, tough luck.") and just... well, mind games.   As with everything, there is a list of "tips" that interviewers should follow. They are sometimes really amusing. Examples of these tips include:  What sets the Alumni Schools Committees apart from other groups like it: *The heartfelt compassion we convey when we express our own disappointment to the candidate upon denied admission.   I feel like the last person he will want to talk to is me, if he even remembers me. I would just be rubbing it in his face, neener neener.    * The joy we share with each applicant when we call to congratulate him/her upon acceptance.    I never got one of these calls! Maybe I was right, my acceptance here was an accident..  Meeting with students in public places: Many alumni meet with applicants in coffee shops, which tend to be mutually acceptable. Avoid meeting with students in unusual places, like a bus terminal (no matter how public that may seem, it still worries parents), or any place that could be construed as a bar (remember that the applicants are all underage).   Bus terminals - sort of gives the impression that you think they're no better than a transient runaway. And I do my best work in bars! Plus, a little alcohol helps to smooth things over. Like they've never had a drink. Not that I condone underage drinking. But a glass of wine, at least! If they haven't, I don't want to be interviewing them. They won't fit in. Except with the tech house and applied math people.    Start out the interview with easy questions about their high school and their extracurricular activities. Do not ask them about their class rank, SAT scores, or GPAs, as these questions often make the students uneasy and give the wrong impression about the university. Also, do not discuss the candidate's chances of admission or criticize other colleges.   Haha, but I want to know that they can perform well under pressure. Besides, no more stupid people at this school. We already have enough of them. And I badmouth other colleges like it's my job, because I obviously went to the best one. Obviously. They should know that ahead of time.   Explain to the applicants that the interview is not a deciding factor in their application; there is very little they might do or say that would guarantee a denial.   But that takes away my power!    Don't feel you have to give every student a "We want you" message; given the 16% admission rate, this may unfairly raise expectations. But...   Now we're talking. We'll just ignore that "but..." If I don't like the person I'm interviewing, and/or think that he is too ugly to attend my school, can I somehow let him know this?    Do convey respect for each student, along with the message that the University is a great place with a lot to offer. This applies even to students who may not particularly impress you, as sometimes the talents or qualities for which the Admission Office may admit a student may not be evident during the interview.   Dammit. It's like they read my mind, and are already scolding me.   Because we, as alumni, represent the university community, our views can be misinterpreted as those of the university. The interview should not be used to test, challenge, persuade, dissuade, debate, confront, corner, or show up the applicant. This obviously applies to sensitive topics such as race, sexuality, religion, and politics, which people often take very personally.   If the interviewee can't take it, he does not belong here. Hello, we are the France of universities, in that we strike/protest every little thing we can. Just for fun. He needs to be ready to take heat.   Handling concerned parents: Occasionally a parent may call you after an interview, worried about how the meeting went. Generally these parents just need someone to listen to them. Keep in mind that they are strongly motivated to help their children get into a good school, and you have just become their main contact with the university.   Woo! More power for me! Mind games with the parents, least of which being the fact I have become their child's sole link to his getting into my school. Mwahaha.  There is also all sorts of fun information about how if my interviews go well and the kids are accepted, that I will be noted as a great interviewer and will become a prime interviewer  since I'll be able to sniff out talent, or as they put it: "Once you become established in your community as "The representative," you will probably no longer need to seek out those names; rather, people will refer top prospects to you."  I do like the idea of being THE representative for the area, wielding all THE power, making or breaking these young adolescents' futures.   I would have kicked ass on  The Apprentice . No doubt about it.

      I realise I do post a lot about crankypants, even though I never see him. It's because the rest of my life is so boring right now. Perhaps after I return from a weekend in New York, something fun will have happened. Until then, here is a snippet from his latest email: I've ordered your Valentine's present--and I bet you have no idea what it is!  For some strange reason that gives me a satisfied feeling.... Perhaps I shouldn't be complaining over the fact that I have a boyfriend and he's finally wised up and is going to get me a present for Valentine's day. Hell, he actually remembers that I'm visiting that weekend. However, did he have to be so... cruel  in teasing me with the fact that he's bought a present. This is called Rubbing It In My Face. He  knows  I hate it when he does this, which just means that he does it every time my birthday/Christmas/some other big gift-giving holiday rolls around. It's just not fair. I'm not good when surprises are being dangled in my face. And crankypants knows this. That Greek myth, Tantalus? I hated it. I felt for the poor guy.

      As is my wont, I like to occassionally taunt Crankypants with other guys I think are cute. Usually, they're actors or big sports stars, and therefore in the abstract realm, as in that I'll never meet them, and therefore he's safe. Or they're 'everyday' people, and he trusts me, or some crap like that. Little does he realise that this following passage from Carrie Ann Wilner's  urlLink article  on Nerve describes me perfectly: Thing is, I'm a shitty girlfriend. You could fuck me all day and take me out to dinner, and I'd still flirt with the cute waiter while you were in the bathroom. That's how it goes. If I find someone attractive, I want to mess around with them, simple as that. It's not so much infidelity as it is greed. And pragmatism: if your relationship collapses, why not have a blue-eyed, nineteen-year-old painter as backup? Although I probably wouldn't cheat on him. Not unless the "blue-eyed, nineteen-year-old painter" in question was Jude Law, or Brad Pitt. Or the hot TA from the summer, but only after having a fight with crankypants and not getting to see him for 6 weeks. Thus naturally, I let him know about my  urlLink newfound affection  for surfers. Surfers, however, are very meetable, as we are shortly going to be in a  urlLink place  where they will be very accessible. This is how a recent exchange went: Him: So. Surfers, huh? Me, all perky and shit: Hell yeah. They're really hot. And buff. But unfortunately short. Did you know that Kelly Slater is only 5'9? Him: Well, I guess you'll have to make do with a taller*, lanky yet still buff, wannabe surfer.  [Note: He says he's 6'5, but I only let him claim 6'4 because I don't want him being more than a foot taller than I am.]   While this doesn't seem like a lot, you don't understand. He never displays anything even approaching jealousy. Not when I have dinners at nice expensive places with exes. Not when I tell him that my TA is super-hot and has asked me out. Not when I tell him that my lab partner is really hot and that I'll be working in close proximity with him for 6 weeks, nor when said lab partner asks me to go back to Oxford with him and continue my studies there. Not even when I have exes who are still in love with me stay overnight (with him on the futon, naturally). This is  huge .  Baby steps, people. Baby steps.

      After my spell at the French-American school today, playing with all the 3-6 year olds (I feel that they give me the youngest age group because I'm the only one willing to play with them, plus, I'm the only one who speaks English fluently), I have changed my views on what gender I want my children to be (because of course, I have planned that far in advance. I also have my whole wedding planned out, every done except for the groom, who will obviously be expected to just fall in with my plans or otherwise we're not getting married).  For the longest time, I wanted 2 girly girls and 1 boy. It was the perfect setup. I'd have two darling girls to dress up, and the boy would be older so he could find his sisters boyfriends. (Obviously, I do not have an older brother and wish I had.)  [Addendum: Crankypants has a younger sister, and has informed me that this is not how it works. Rather, they spend their time trying to protect their sister and ensure that she never has a boyfriend, let alone one who is one of his friends, especially if they're "nymphomaniac child molestors", while they share the same roof. I can't wait to meet the NCM. Absolutely can't.]   However, today, I was lucky enough to have two bawling 4-year-old girls on my hands. Zoe, a particularly cute blonde with pale blue eyes, has this problem where she  needs  my full attention, at all times. I'm not allowed to talk to, let alone play with, anyone else while she's around. This is a small problem, becuase I usually have at least 6 children to deal with at any given time. But Zoe, if you say no to her, she immediately pouts, her lower lips starts to stick out and wobble, and next thing you know, she's sulking in the corner, tears welling up in her eyes. Today, she wanted to play a French variation of Mother May I. However, she lost. Immediately, she accused Emily, the other girl playing, of cheating, and when I tried to say that no, Emily didn't cheat... off Zoe was, in the corner, sucking her thumb and pouting.   Usually, Zoe is the only petulant 4-year-old I have to deal with (she also claims she has no friends and will only be my partner, because she loves me the most). Yet, a new kid started coming after-school, Meghan. Meghan has a darling light-brown bob, a retrousse nose and the cutest jumpers. My first introduction to her was when she was playing in the dirt and yelled "Look!" So I came over, and she showed me a worm. Ew. I think I screamed and told her to drop it. Then I told one of the boys to bring it over to one of the teachers and scare her. Haahaa, I'm mean. Anyway. Meghan. She was off happily playing with Emily, when all of a sudden (while I was trying to comfort Zoe without telling her to shut the hell up and stop pouting) she came running over to me, bawling. Apparently, Emily was tired of playing with her, and in between big sobs, Meghan said that sometimes in the day she liked to play with Lily and sometimes Claire, but that Emily does it back to her and will play with Jill and Sarah but not her, but now Emily was being mean and playing with James and she was only doing it to get back at her. I did not really follow their argument, but Emily was all matter-of-fact explaining her point of view, while Meghan was sniffling, tears running down her face. Then Meghan said what had to be the line of all lines: "I just want to colour now, colouring makes me happy. In my heart. I feel happy in my heart when I colour."  That's it. No more girls for me. At least, no cute girly girls who are only going to cry from the time they're born until they get married and aren't my problem anymore. If I'm having a girl, it's going to be an Emily. Who, if you've noted, is the unifying element of Zoe's and Meghan's bawling-fests today. My girl is going to be tough and not a crier (though hopefully not a tomboy either. Somehow it will work out) Or I'm going to have males who adore their mother and protect her from life's harms. Such as taking out the trash and washing dishes. Because by golly, when I have children, I'm gonna teach them how to do household chores, unlike my parents who spared me this very necessary task.

      I have determined that I could be a surfer's girlfriend. After watching whatever surfing competition NBC was airing yesterday, I was reminded of how hot  urlLink Kelly Slater  is (as well as  urlLink other   urlLink buff   urlLink surfers ), and of how much fun surfing looks. You will never see me out there on those waves, however. Oh no. I am definitely the beach bunny sort. I can sit on the beach and cheer my hot surfing boyfriend on, while working on my tan and eating fish tacos. However, unfortunately most big-name surfers are short. This is unfortunate, but I am willing to make sacrifices. Besides, on the beach, I won't need to (read: can't) wear heels, so as long as he's taller than 5'8, and we spend all of our time on the sand, it will be fine.   Now, I need to find myself a surfer boyfriend. There was an  urlLink article  in the  New York Times  on Friday, talking about the surfing community in Rincon, Puerto Rico. We are going to Puerto Rico in ooh, just under 5 weeks. Crankypants is excited because he'll get to take surfing lessons. Me? I'm excited because of the following passages from the article: Note to aspiring female surfers: the instructors tend to be young and attractive, which makes having sunblock rubbed onto your back and shoulders much more enjoyable.   ...  "There could be a few more girls here," Mr. Chapman said. "But besides that, what more can a guy ask for in a long weekend?" Baby, here I come.

      Why I need a Maltese:   The Maltese stands less than 8 inches tall.  This means it fits my requirements of being able to fit into a handbag.    The Maltese is a gentle, playful, affectionate dog that loves to be the center of attention.  Like dog, like owner.    It is highly energetic indoors but requires only short daily walks outside.  This is good because we all know I'm lazy and am not inclined to take dogs on long walks. The summer I lived in New York, I watched my friend's cocker spaniel, who was named Scooby. Scooby was cute, but had two quirks. One was that he hated men. He always knew when crankypants got off the elevator to meet me at my apartment, and he would start barking violently. The other quirk was that Scooby only wanted to be walked when it was convenient for him - like, past midnight when I'd gotten home from a good night of drinking. Did he want to go on a walk at 5PM, when I got off work? No. Only at midnight when Central Park is definitely unsafe. But on those occassions I could get him to go for a walk, he would somehow know exactly when I was ready to turn around, and then would sit and wouldn't budge for a good fifteen minutes. Hence, I need a dog that won't cause me so many problems.    As its name suggests, this breed originated on the island of Malta. It was a favorite home companion of the upper classes of ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome.  Malta.  urlLink My convent . Need I say more?    More recently, in Victorian times, women matched the color of the satin ribbon they tied around the Maltese's topknot with their own wardrobe.  This is a little excessive for me - oh, who am I kidding? I would completely make sure my dog was colour-coordinated with my outfit of the day. Just following in good tradition, you see. I know, the puppy talk is starting to get excessive. But I am  truly  in love with this dog. Maybe it's hormones, who knows. But I melt every time I see one. I download dog photos and videos like some people download porn. It is starting to be a cause of concern for my friends. Speaking of downloading stuff, go  urlLink here  and download a video of Malteses in action. They are so adorable, I can't get over it. Seriously, it's like this dog was made for me.

      ...for in a 50 hour time span, I bought not only a seersucker skirt (which makes crankypants super-excited, 'cause he says we can match when gets his  urlLink seersucker   urlLink suit ), but I have also bought my first-ever plane ticket to the midwest.   Next thing you know, I'll be wearing overalls and working on a farm in Arkansas. Oh wait, that was  The Simple Life . And I'm not Paris Hilton nor Nicole Richie. Phew. I was even more worried there for a second. So hard to keep reality and TV straight.

      It is a good thing I don't live in New York because I'd either be drunk all the time or hungover all the time. And broke to boot, since you can't help but shop there, there are too many stores. But New York is definitely a fun place to visit, even though I know too many people there so that I can't visit only one friend at a time, everyone else somehow knows when I'll be around. The grapevine is like on turbospeed. And I mistakenly told Nick that I was going to be in town. Well, no, I wanted to see him - but I wouldn't have, if I knew in advance how he'd be acting. It's gotten to the point where Nick has ceased to be amusing, and has crossed that line into the territory of being vastly annoying. Let's do a play-by-play recall of the night. (Look, I'm using sports terms! All that damn basketball I've been forced into watching, I swear..)  Michelle and I meet up with Nick at   urlLink Bar Veloce  - my choice, of course. We get wine. Nick consistently orders the same thing I'm getting. I actually say, "Why don't you get something different," and he says, "No, I think we should get the same thing." Bizarre. Have a mind of your own, already. Nick proceeds to get all touchy-feely in the "obviously we're dating" sort of way - except, we're  not . Dating, that is. Nor have we ever, really. Michelle later asks me why I don't hit him. I tell her I feel sort of bad because he's a friend but if it happens again, that I'd see. This becomes a recurring theme for the night.   Michelle's trader friends meet us at Bar Veloce, and decide that this place isn't frat boy enough for their tastes. No matter, we go to  urlLink Nevada Smith's , which is generally not a place I'd choose, but I don't really mind and I can't always get my way, it's not healthy. Based on the way Nick is treating me, they assume that he is my boyfriend. Boy are they wrong, and quickly I set them straight. Then they say I should punch Nick the next time he touches me, and that they will pay good money if I do it. The rest of the night, anytime any of them catch me talking to Nick, they stand behind him and make punching motions. They are also incredibly amused by the fact that Nick has apparently decided to go by Nicholas. They spend the rest of the night referring to him as don't-call-me-Nick (example of its usage: "Hey, where's your friend, Nicholas, don't-call-me-Nick?") and calling him Nick anyway.    Nick tries to convince me that Nevada Smith's isn't the sort of place that I'd like, and that we should go back to Bar Veloce, just the two of us. I ignore him.   Nick decides that he only wants to talk to me. This is understandable, as I'm the only one in the group but he knows, but seriously. We're in a big group of people. I want to talk to the other people too. He gets pouty and goes and drinks at the bar for awhile.   He spends much of the night making comments like, "when people are smart like you and me," in a pathetic attempt to have the both of us aligned on the same side. I don't really get it.    He then asks me if Michelle has a bed. Of course Michelle has a bed,  what does she sleep on, the floor? He says that one of his roommates is out of town, and that I could sleep over in his apartment if I wanted to.  It's a nice offer, but what do I look like, stupid? He says that his apartment is very nice - which is in stark contrast to last month, when he told me that his apartment was rather dorm-like. I call him on this, and he says that somehow over the course of a month it has magically transformed.   After I turn down that request, he asks me where I'm going to be in the summer. Hello, Los Angeles, obviously. He says that one of his roommates isn't going to be there over the summer, and that I should move in and that it would be a lot of fun if we lived together. I just look at him as if he were stupid. Which he is - stupid in this instance.   After both those efforts fail, he asks me what I'm doing Saturday - which is leaving New York, which he knew. He says that I should stay in town, we'll meet for lunch and then go to the  urlLink Whitney Museum . I tell him that no, I really need to return to Providence, and that anyway, crankypants is going to come with me to the Whitney when we're back in May. Rather pugnaciously, he asks if crankypants likes modern art "as much as we do." Note the use of the word "we" again. I roll my eyes and leave it at that.    With this mention of crankypants, he asks how the two of us are doing. He looks extremely disappointed by the fact that we had a great time in Puerto Rico, and are going to both be in LA over the summer. I've been going out with crankypants for almost two years now. Get over it already.   Then out of the blue, he says that he's not getting together with his ex-girlfriend, that she's not what he's looking for. I ask him if she ever  was  what he was looking for, alluding to the time they dated senior year. He says that yes! they were incredibly happy for awhile. I want to be mean and remind him of the fact that he cheated on her several times that year with me, and also told me he'd break up with her if I wanted him to. However, I choose the tactful route - not as fun, perhaps, but we don't want to be rehashing any bad memories (for me, at least), and just lift an eyebrow which causes him to heavily protest that they were indeed happy. Right, my ass.    Finally, at 2:30AM he leaves to go home.  Finally . However, this means that I'm subjected to a couple of kisses - on the temple, because I duck my head at the last minute, trying not to laugh at the punching motions some of the traders are making. I seriously thought he was going to last only 'til 1AM. Sigh.  It's not like I've even been stringing Nick along - rather, I've been brutally honest with him the entire time. One of Michelle's trader friends asked if he could come to the dinner in May where crankypants and Nick get to meet. He was very insistent that he should be invited, and gave me his phone number and email so I can contact him with the details. I can make this a sporting event and charge big bucks for tickets to this spectacle. The only thing is - will Nick even show up? Will his curiousity get the better of him? Or will he be too petulantly jealous to even make an appearance? How will he react when he meets crankypants - did I mention that Nick is sensitive about his height (5'10, he claims, although I think he's adding an extra inch on there), and crankypants is 6'4? Hell, what will crankypants's reaction to meeting Nick be? He's heard most of the stories, how's he going to act? Are there going to be some fun macho caveman antics? All these questions - and more - will be answered in a couple of months.  [cue anticipatory music, like the sort you hear on soap operas.]

         There are hot dog stands all over the place.  Quite literally, I could eat my way through the city. When I lived here 3 years ago, when I'd get out of work early, I'd walk from my job on 23rd up to the Upper West Side, and believe me, I'd stop at nearly every other hot dog stand and treat myself for walking so far. It is so much fun. Good thing I don't live here, I'd get fat off hot dogs.    There are so many cute dogs all over the place.  Especially on the Upper East Side, where some of my friends live, and down to the area around Bloomingdales, and then down in SoHo and Nolita. It is the BEST EVER. And lots of people have little white dogs, which are my personal favourite. Please note that there is a pet store on Lexington and 62nd that has the cutest puppies in the window. I could stand there for hours just cooing at the baby yorkies, baby pugs (pugs are still cute when they're little, then they get old and fugly), baby poodles and baby malteses. Today, I couldn't stop myself, and  had  to go into the store to hold some of them. This little teacup maltese won my heart. I  have  to have one now. If anyone would like to get me a present, one of these puppies would be perfect.  Between the hot dogs and the white dogs, I don't know which I like more. That's why in my perfect world I'll have lots of both.

      It is quite annoying when you're talking to a guy at a bar who just won't go away, and then commits the even worse offense of casually resting his hand On Your Ass. Especially when he's prattling away in his barely understandable heavily French-accented English about how London is the best city ever (hello, he is from Paris, what the hell is he talking about? That lost him so many points right there. That, and the fact that his hand is on your ass.) Especially when you're trying to check out another guy at the other end of the bar who is much cuter, and isn't a London-based French banker who twists the conversation so that he has a lameass excuse to look you up and down. And then when you go off to the bathroom and return to talk to your friends, blatantly ignoring him, it's just head-bangingly annoying when he tries to return to talk to you. Some people should just get the message.

      I really need to lay off poor crankypants. I think, that amazingly, I've actually hit a nerve and that he's starting to demonstrate jealous tendencies. Examples:   When he asked what I was doing this weekend, I told him that I was going to go to New York to see some friends. Oh, and that  urlLink Nick  (#1, if you care) wanted me to go to New Jersey with him to pick up a coffee table. His response? "Now, if that isn't a euphemism.." at which point I interrupted, "Euphemism for  what ?" I mean, seriously. Going to Jersey to pick up a coffee table is just that. So I laughed at him. Then he said, "Maybe Nick can refer to me as 'that thing in Virginia' again." (The last time Nick asked me about crankypants, that's what he called him, "that thing in Virginia," following that with a "do you see yourselves breaking up in the near future?" What a question.) And I laughed at him again. Poor boy. He definitely is sensitive regarding this. I had no idea it stung that much, but he should give me a better feeling of how he feels regarding this matter, rather than trying to be cool and pretending that it doesn't affect him at all. But did I stop there? Oh no.   Then I told him that my friend and I were going to hang out with some of her trader friends. This did not go over too well either. Him: "Traders are meatheads." Someone is feeling threatened! I tried to soothe him by telling him I was going to be scoping them out for other friends, which is true. But he knows me, and he knows that I'd flirt shamelessly with them beforehand just for kicks.   As if that weren't enough, then I told him about how my friends are convinced that my friend Stan is in love with me. Just because he called me at midnight the other night to tell me so doesn't mean it, does it? But he does, I've known he's been mad crazy about me for forever, but really, we're just friends. For various reasons - usually my own fatigue, I've also had to cancel lunch on Stan 4 times in a row, which makes me a horrible person. But then I told crankypants, "Well, Stan loves me, so he can deal with it. He'll still love me." Now, I realise that it is entirely my fault if crankypants never ever tells me he loves me, because I effectively screwed myself over with that statement and my attitudes regarding Stan and Nick. I am so stupid sometimes.    But just to add icing to the cake, I then told him that in  urlLink grad school   - wait, what's that? Did someone's first choice accept her? YES THEY DID!! A year in Cambridge will be lovely! I am so excited already! Anyway, I told him that the business school has great fancy formals with the school of education. Traditionally, the B-school was mostly males, while the ed school was mostly females, hence these forced socials. I  love  ridiculous traditions like this. Especially since it means that I can wear the masses of dresses I've accumulated and not yet worn! My lovely  urlLink BCBGs  and  urlLink Dianes , your day will come very soon. Obviously, this is the Best Part Ever of attending that school up north. Screw the educational value. Crankypants, very amused, said, "You'll do anything to get me up there," to which I blithely replied, "But you're not invited, they don't let people who don't attend the two schools come!" at which point, a little miffed, he said, "Sounds like they're trying for their own form of eugenics then." Haahaahaa.  He should be worried. Serves him right for never visiting me up here, and for not letting me come down for his spring formal, citing the fact that he had too much work. He didn't think that would come back to bite him in the ass?  The best (worst?) part of all of this is that all four of these points were laid upon him in one phone call, I didn't even give him a chance to breathe. But he is obviously starting to respond to my needling provocations now. I just need to be careful and adoring for a spell to soothe his wounded ego. At which point I'll just start it all over again. I think a week is enough recovery time. I will be the first to admit that I am a handful and a half to deal with. Really, I sit around thinking of ways to aggravate him. It's so much fun.

      I generally don't promote products, but I find I have to make the exception for this:  urlLink Neutrogena Blackhead Eliminating (TM) Scrub  Now,while I have been blessed with skin that never had bad acne, the occassional break-out every six months or so, of late I have bemoaning the pores on my nose. The super-gross-clogged-with-gunk pores on my nose. They're not really blackheads, they're just  Icky . Those Biore strips that claim to clear out your pores don't really work. And while I would love to indulge in a monthly facial, I feel that the effects are too temporary to do any long-term good. Plus, it just kills the budget. That $90 could go towards ... I don't know, more shoes and purses I don't really need. But since using this miracle product, my skin has never been smoother. It's like I've had a facial  every night . I don't know what it is, maybe the salicyclic acid, maybe the super-large microbeads (my daily Aveeno cleanser has microbeads too teensy to do any good, I've determined) - whatever the cause may be, I can't stop rubbing my smooth just-like-I-had-gotten-a-facial nose.  On a completely unrelated note, I received my Bergdorf Goodman's catalogue yesterday, which is really just one big glamourised advertisement - like  Vogue  and  Elle , but with even less written articles and at about 5 times the weight. Nice thick glossy paper. Anyway, inside there is an interview with Plum Sykes, who has written this marvelous new book called  urlLink  Bergdorf Blondes  , which you can bet your pretty penny I'm going to run out and buy. Okay, realistically, there isn't any running. There is online ordering, though. In any case, even though I hate hardcover books because they're too heavy to hold up in bed, I think this one is plenty worth it. (I go through trends when buying hardcover books, because obviously few topics are worthy of arm strain in bed. It used to be biographies of devastatingly charming women who would "inadvertantly" ruin men's lifes, such as  urlLink Lady Caroline Blackwood  and  urlLink the Mitford sisters . Of late, it has revolved around NY society and topics involved with the fashion industry, such as the aforementioned  Bergdorf Blondes  and  urlLink  The Devil Wears Prada  . Conscious manifestations of my subconscious? Perhaps.)  One last random item: another sign that it needs to spring already? My sweaters drawer and my pants drawer are so heavy that they've fallen off the runners on which they slide, so they no longer open. I don't have the time or energy necessary to fully yank them out so that I can fix said drawers. Plus, to truly fix the drawers, I'd have to get rid of some clothes, and I already did that six months ago. I can't get rid of anything more. But anyway, my drawers not opening means that the only winter wear I have available to me are 3 sweaters, and the pants that I was too lazy to put away last week. Henceforth, it needs to be spring since my tank top drawer is the only one that still opens. And all my skirts are on hangers so I'm safe there. At least, until the closet rod breaks.

      So, as I've  urlLink previously mentioned , one of my good friends from high school is getting married. We met when we were nine, and I remember her from when she had thick frizzy hair and horrible glasses to when she had mother-induced anorexia and teeth-whitening phases, and everything in between and beyond.  Our senior year of high school, she met this guy at a college pre-frosh get-together. Six years later, they're getting married.   She's the first of my good friends to get married, and it's just slightly scary. Then again, she and her fiance lead such a  boring  life that I don't envy them at all. He is now a 2nd-year law student, and she has some job to pass the time until he's done and they move back to LA.  Obviously, she has reconfigured her life so that He is the priority and their entire relationship is based on His needs. Every Sunday, he cooks a huge pot of soup so that becomes lunch for the rest of the week. All they do every weekend is clean the apartment (and get into big fights about how to properly dust) and hang out with other couples. It is a very antiseptic, very dry, very mind-numbing existence. Not that I'm in any position to judge - but really. When you have raging fights over whether or not you need a rug to place before the sink - well, that's a life I'd rather not lead.  But she's happy, and I'm happy for her. I'm just glad that it's not me.   So she's getting married this August, and I'm one of the bridesmaids. (Thankfully, the  urlLink dress  is remotely flattering - it has a fuller skirt than the picture shows - the first one she chose had the highest neckline, which would have just been atrocious.) Now, crankypants is not terribly thrilled with this, because it means that I have other duties aside from tending to his every need. (Haha, like I do that anyway.) So he has concocted his own plan that will keep him amused. It consists of the following:   Wearing a seersucker suit.  For some reason, he really wants to wear one. Should I be distressed by the fact that he is excited that the Barney's warehouse sale is before the wedding, because he is convinced he'll find his seersucker there? But seriously. Not only does he want to wear this seersucker suit - which will make him look like Orville Redenbacher, I am convinced - but he wants to combine this with aviators, a trucker hat, and sneakers. I'm having the bride's mother personally write "no sunglasses, no seersucker, no sneakers" on our invitation.     Getting the mother-of-the-bride drunk.  (Yes, the MotB is one of those controlling WASPs whose first-and-only daughter is getting married. Since she doesn't work, all she does is plan her daughter's wedding. She's psycho.) Because I am "abandoning" him during the ceremony, he's decided to bring not one, but two flasks from which to imbibe scotch during that time. But that's not enough for him, oh no. Somehow, he figures that he can get a seat next to the mother-of-the-bride and convince her to drink from his flasks during the ceremony also. That failing, he plans on just ordering her drinks all night so that she loses control.    Surprising the happy couple with be a mariachi band.  Needless to say, this will NOT go over well with the couple nor the MotB, nor the hoity toity little private club where the wedding's being held. Maybe the MotB  will  need those drinks.  The problem is, I can actually see him doing all of the above. My personal fun ways in which the wedding could be spiced up are purely theoretical, but just as amusing.   Having Scarlett Ace crash the wedding.  But she wouldn't just crash the wedding, she'd do it with a BANG!. Such as running up to the groom, slapping him and telling him that she's carrying his baby how DARE he marry this anemic person? It would be priceless. I'm already doubled over with laughter now.     Running around and changing everything from his last name (which she's obviously taking) to hers.  Now, I won't reveal their last names because I bet you anything he's the sort of person who googles his name to find out if there are other people with it. Suffice it to say that her last name is Much More Mellifluous than his. His is icky and hard to pronounce. He really should take hers, but 1) obviously he would never do such a radical thing and 2) he has the same first name as her father, that would get really confusing. (What's that about daughters marrying men like their fathers? Did I mention that her father is also a lawyer? I see their marriage already, shallow and rocky like her parents'.)    Hitting on the bride's younger brother.  Her younger brother is HOT. If not for the fact that he is three years younger than I am and a part of her crazy high-maintenance family, I would have totally gone after him already. I picked him up from the airport last year, and my jaw dropped when I saw him (since it had been 4 years.) It would be swell if he were my accompanying groomsman and we  had  to dance together. If not, I'll orchestrate a reason. Crankypants, needless to say, does not think this is amusing at all. Not like he'd be able to stop me.  Give me time. I'll think of more ways in which we could make this wedding all sorts of fun. Because otherwise, I'm going to have to suffer (with a bottle of wine or four) through this very quiet, very proper affair, and we can't have that now, can we?

      Grad school update:  So I sent a very nice letter to the Director of Admissions, saying that I was rather confused and didn't want to get my hopes up, so could he please clarify whether or not I had gotten in? And this is what I receive in response: An official notification was mailed to you on March 9 regarding admission. If you do not receive it by Wednesday of this week, please notify me again.  At first glance, this is a YES! I GOT IN! Then I reread it, and realised that this was the vaguest email ever and that it actually did NOT tell me whether I was in or not. As a matter of fact, it only made things worse. So I called the Office of Admissions, only to get some girl (who sounded like that chick in  Orange County  who worked in Stanford's Admissions Office) say, "Well, all the information* you've given me is correct, but I still can't tell you over the phone. You'll need to email the Director of Admissions directly." However, his email expressly says to not contact him until Wednesday. So this means I SUFFER in this purgatory of not knowing whether or not I'm freaking in. I don't need this sort of stress.   But I know that this means I'm not in. Because life just works like that.   *The information I gave her consisted of: my name, my SSN, and the fact that I got that  urlLink  confusing email  last week. It wasn't rocket science. And just tell me already, so that I stop annoying my friends with my frustration over this topic.

      I thought that I was in the clear. That I was safe. That I could take a deep breath and put it out of my mind.  That I didn't have to  urlLink go a-hunting for tennis skirts .  After our trip to PR involved only beaches and no tennis courts, the whole frantic must-find-myself-a-cute-tennis-skirt-but-WHERE? rush was over. Or so I thought.   Then crankypants called, saying in this super-excited voice, "Guess what the apartment complex I'm staying in the summer has?" Me: "Um, no Russian mafia people?" Him: "No! Tennis courts! We can play this summer!"  Now, he lived in these same apartments two years ago, and they had tennis courts back then, so I don't know how he missed them. And I don't know why he's so focused on us playing tennis together. I think it's because I refuse to swim laps or run with him. What's wrong with just tanning on the beach? I don't understand his efforts at incorporating more exercise into my life. Maybe I  like  being a lazy turd. (At the beach, he will make us walk along the shoreline forever. And his definition of "let's walk to the end of the beach" vastly differs from mine. I will go until I see the end in the far horizon, and determine that it's time to turn back. He'll keep going until he hits a physical barrier that will prevent him from going any further. What happened to just sitting and reading on the beach?) Swimming laps is so  boring . I hate it when water gets up my nose, so that leaves me with backstroke - and then I hate it when I accidentally crash into the wall because I forget how many strokes it is from the flags to the wall. It really hurts. Plus, you can't read a magazine while swimming (for obvious reasons), and I can't focus enough to swim for any extended period of time. My mind starts to wander, I forget that I'm swimming laps for exercise, and I end up floating on my back watching the sky and getting annoyed at people who splash me. How dare they, those heathens. And with running - well, I get so caught up looking at the houses I'm running past that I simply must slow down to admire them.   But this intense interest in tennis on his part means that I absolutely  cannot  procrastinate on finding a cute tennis outfit - or four, it simply wouldn't do to rewear the same getup repeatedly - but WHERE does one find pleated tennis skirts? The only ones I can find don't have pleats. My tennis skirts have to have pleats. It's just the way I want them. They're very grosgrain-ribbon-bow-in-hair perky.  I have to start the hunt now, so that I accumulate a nice selection by the time the summer comes around.   Of course, I suppose I don't  have  to buy tennis skirts - Ha Ha Ha. That is not an option. If I'm going to participate in a sport, I'm going to be attired accordingly. Obviously. Plus, every good wardrobe should have some tennis outfits.  He is so going to regret playing tennis with me. I haven't played competitively in seven years, and I was no good back then, either. My strength lies in that I am relatively consistent in returning baseline strokes.  I hate playing the net, I'm always afraid that a tennis ball is going to whack me in the nose. And when I get bored at the baseline, I'll just lob it back to you. I am super-good at lobbing. It requires little skill and technique. But you have to hit the ball to me, I'm not going to run to get to it. Yes, as with everything else in my life, the game has to be structured around my rules, otherwise I'm just not gonna play.   urlLink Scarlett Ace , start practicing now. I'm roping you in for mixed doubles. Paul gets to be your partner, you lucky girl.

      Last night, I received an email from the Director of Admissions of another  urlLink grad school  I applied to, with a letter attached from the Assocate Dean. Here is how it starts: Dear Admitted Student:  Congratulations on your acceptance...! The rest of the letter is your standard "welcome and here is stuff you need to know" stuff. Now, this normally would not be confusing (and I would have no reason for writting about it) - if not for the fact that I haven't received a paper copy of my acceptance yet. As a matter of fact, the last hard mail contact I had from them was a letter - dated March 8, mind you - that said they had received my complete application (never mind the fact that I had sent it in mid-January), and that all acceptances would be sent in writing.  I would be absolutely celebrating now - well, still waiting to hear from my first choice, those stinkers - except that I'm still confused. Am I in? It seems like I am, according to this email - but what if they sent it to me by accident? Email is such a tricky medium. Will they  have  to let me in then? Could I sue for false expectations? What if it's a clever virus that's going to destroy my computer? What if they sent it by accident to everyone that applied? What do they do in that instance?  I emailed the Director of Admissions this morning, and was sent an automated out-of-office reply. Of  course  he's out of the office when I have a question. But this just leads me to further believe that this might be some kind of computer snafu. They're just playing games with my mind because they're mean. Harumph.   Addendum, 16h21  Another grad school (that I thankfully  urlLink got into already ) sent out an email yesterday about registering for the fall semester, only to send another email today that said this: Earlier this week you may have received an e-mail from the Office of the University Registrar regarding general registration information pertaining to fall 2004 registration.  This message was intended for returning students, but was inadvertently sent to a number of newly admitted students as well as candidates still under consideration for admission.  Please know that only a letter from the admissions office constitutes admission... We apologize for any confusion this may have caused. If I hadn't already been accepted, I would be in tears right now. You know that's what happened with the other university. There is apparently some sort of sneaky evil demon virus going around NY grad schools, that causes them to falsely raise poor applicants' hopes, only to mercilessly dash them 24 hours later.

      Normally, I hate the thought of couples splitting up, because it shows the very transitory nature of relationships, no matter how rock-steady they seem to be. And it's always a depressing thought. However, I was reading  urlLink Page Six  yesterday, and apparently it seems that three of my favourite celebrities have broken up with their others. That is, if you didn't know - Michael Vartan and Jennifer Garner, George Clooney and Krista Allen, and Andy Roddick and Mandy Moore. Kaput, no more. I am generally not a malicious person and I don't like it when people break up - but these three guys are now back on the market, and I'm perfectly willing to make an exception for them. Michael Vartan lives in LA and is half-French. George Clooney has a house on Lake Como. Andy Roddick... well, he's a touch young for my tastes, but he'll do too. Now if only Jude Law would dump the anorexic model he's seeing, and Brad Pitt would leave Jennifer (but they're so cute together, I don't want it to happen.. not really..)... I'd be perfectly willing to be their rebound for awhile.

         He wants to retire from his legal career at the age of 40 and open a hotel.  Okay, I knew this already, but I didn't know it was happening at the young age of 40, I always thought he was going to do it around 60 or so. Maybe 55. I can and can't see this happening. He is a massive workaholic, yet manages to give off the impression to those who don't know him that he's a tremendous slacker. It's quite contradictory. But for him to stop working at 40? I don't know. But, if he opens up his hotel, then I can have my hole-in-the-wall beach bar on his grounds and not need to pay rent. This means he's gonna have to get a place with enough land so that my bar can be hidden and so that hotel guests don't come in droves. Because it's all about me and what I want, you know.    He uses Propecia (sp?).  For those of you who don't know what it is (I certainly didn't), it's some costly drug that prevents hair loss. It doesn't help it grow back in, it just prevents more from being shed. I really hadn't noticed that crankypants was losing his hair, but apparently he went home over winter break and his sister teased him, saying that he had thinning hair, so of course, in the name of vanity, he got a prescription and now has to take it for the rest of his life. He does have a rather nice thick mop of hair, so I'm glad that it's not going anywhere anytime soon. Still. It's rather funny.    Little girls between the ages of 1-5  love  him.  It's really quite amusing. Starting with the plane flight, there would be all these little girls who would just stare at him, and smile and flirt. He thinks that this means he's going to be "cursed" with a zoo of little girls, instead of the soccer team of boys that he wants, which is fine by me. But it was funny watching these little girls be completely entranced by him, and then watch him be slightly uneasy with all this female adoration.    It is possible for him to spend a week not talking about law school.  And he also barely did any law-related work. This is a minor miracle. It also meant that all attention was on *me* and *my* wishes and that I was his sole focus (and his reason for being, even, heehee). I  am  a vainglorious five-year-old who loves the spotlight. However, I feel like this might be the only time that I get to experience this. Maybe it'll happen again after he takes the Bar and before he starts working. But then, that's it. Until he opens his hotel, I guess.     He has the most bizarre friends.  I've already mentioned  urlLink Harold  - oh, but there's a new twist to the Harold story. He randomly met this girl at a bar, they got raging drunk, he took her back to his place where she proceeded to convince him to buy plane tickets home so that she could meet his parents. He didn't even know he had done this until he received the confirmation in his inbox the next day. What a scheming shrew - I don't know any relatively sane girl who would ever do that. Serves him right for being stupid. He's already a trust fund child, and you know that when she sees his house, which crankypants tells me is one of the nicest in their area, she is not letting go. I'm prepared for the announcement any day now that she's pregnant, and that he's marrying her. But enough of Harold. Crankypants's other best friend from high school, Elliott, is teaching English at a high school in Puerto Rico. Elliott also has a penchant for barely legal girls - hence this teaching job is perfect for him. As a matter of fact, he met his current girlfriend when he was her English tutor in Kuwait. She is now 18 and at Middlebury, and although he claims she is The One, he is still sleeping around in PR. It is impossible to describe Elliott. You have to meet him to understand what a character he is. Vain - he found out about crankypants use of Propecia, and you know he went and bought himself some the next day - but not in an obnoxious preening way. At least not in front of me. He is a "man of the earth", as we started to call him - kayaking out to a nearby island to collect conch shells, sleeping in hammocks, wanting to open up an organic farm, wanting to just have a barn in the backyard to do his sculpture, etcetc. He has a nine-foot longboard, even though he just started surfing, because he's that kind of guy (and he has not yet mastered control over it.) Elliott is also overly concerned with sex enhancing drugs, the reliability of condoms, and actually anything relating to sex. After I told him about Cialis, you could totally tell he was going to try to acquire himself some. As well as the fact that conch is the Viagra of the sea - it's all conch for him, from now on. I could go on and on. He is just the biggest source of entertainment ever.     There was a time he was even skinnier than he is now.  This is quite hard to believe. He claims that he is 6'4 and 170 pounds. I think he's really 165, but is rounding up because any less just sounds emaciated. He doesn't look anorexic, but he is definitely skinny. There is no fat on his body, it's very annoying. The body of a true distance swimmer. It makes me look like a fat dumpling in comparison, I swear. It would make anyone look like a fat dumpling. But, Elliott told me that crankypants had filled out since high school. This leads me to believe that he must have honestly just been a skeleton. It's quite scary. I am glad that there is now some meat - however meagre - on his bones now.     In secret, he thinks that the white fluffball dogs I love are cute.  No doubt, he will deny this 'til the cows come home. But let me point out that it was  his  idea to go visit the dogs that lived down the street from our hotel. Not mine. I think that's proof enough.

      I highly recommend, that at least at one point in your life, that you travel with a significant other. No, more than just a weekend trip, but a real vacation. A nice solid week-long jaunt to some foreign locale, preferably heavy on the beaches and light on the shopping - yes, rather like what I just did.  It was especially pleasant because crankypants took care of all the details. I didn't have to bother keeping track of my boarding pass while in transit - and I am always misplacing that stupid thing - because guess what? Crankypants had it. I didn't have to lift any heavy bags, didn't have to figure out how we were getting from one point to another, etcetc. In essence, I didn't have to think of any of the technical details, as he dealt with all of it. Of course, this may sound just like travelling with the parents - but it is not the same at all. At All. For instance, with your parents, they generally have the last say, and getting drunk with them is not that fun. With a significant other, you get equal - if not more - say, getting drunk with them is fun, and then there's some great sex thrown into the mix. That latter is key.   Lots of beaches are preferable. There is nothing like sunning during the day, not doing anything strenuous, then later comparing tans. It beats walking around all day looking at cultural things and then being so exhausted that you don't want to do anything but sleep at the end of the day. Not that I'm a complete heathen - you need a couple of things to look at besides the ocean, otherwise your brain will atrophy. The lack of shopping - so shocking coming from me! - is also important, because if there are stores, odds are that you will end up separating during the day, and then what's the point of vacationing together?  Of course, then if you're in a long-distance relationship as I am, you get back from the idyllic week , return to the bitter cold of the Northeast, and mope around, missing the sun desperately and missing your boyfriend perhaps even more. But at least there's some light gleam of comfort coming from the fact that it's almost summer and you'll have an entire 3 uninterrupted months together.

      Preliminary musings on our trip to Puerto Rico:  Even though I am definitely a "beach person," eight consecutive days on the beach is just too much, especially when it is humid and the wind is kicking the beautiful fine white sand into your eyes.    Speaking of humid, why did I not think it was going to be humid? For some reason, I was imagining dry heat. Was I ever wrong. This made the few pairs of pants and shirts with sleeves that I packed utterly useless.   6 pairs of shoes - definitely too many. As predicted, I only ended up wearing the flipflops during the day, and the slingbacks at night. Also, as expected, crankypants only brought 3 pairs, and made fun of the fact that I had so many.    Let's get back to the sand. Not only does it blow everywhere, it sticks to you like glue. No amount of brushing will get it off, you have to flick at each individual grain one by one numerous times. Needless to say, this got tiring after awhile and I'd just get into bed with sandy feet. This was fine, because I managed to make all the sand get on crankypants's side of the bed, leaving me sand-free but leaving him with the illusion that he was still sleeping on the beach. He did not find this amusing. However, I did.    The drivers on Puerto Rico are maniacs. It's like driving in Boston, but ten times worse, if that's imaginable. They don't follow any traffic rules, and this is not helped by the fact that many of the roads are a) unpaved, b) if paved, ridded with potholes, c) have no lane markings whatsoever, d) are sized for Mini Coopers, or e) any combination of the above.    There is this one fantastic radio station, La Mega, that quite honestly has only 10 songs on their playlist, which they repeat over and over and over again. Guaranteed, you will hear Jessica Simpson, some Outkast song about poo-poo, Maroon 5, Justin Timberlake, and Limp Bizkit at least 5 times a day. They also have these deejays with the most obnoxious laughs, who are inexplicably fond of this game called "Guess what I'm thinking!" No joke. "Guess a number between 400 and 500!" People will call in with their guesses, which will range anywhere from 0-1000. As nobody has guessed the answer, they'll narrow it down to "Guess a number between 400 and 450!" Callers' answers again range from 0-1000. "Guess a number between 400 and 405!" Now, you think at this point that there are only FIVE possibilities and that the game can only last another 2 minutes, tops. You are so wrong. Again, guesses will range from 0-1000. This will go on for another 30 minutes as people will re-guess numbers already guessed and will not recognise the fact that they only have 5 options. Variations include: "Guess what animal I'm thinking of!", "Guess what 80s pop star I'm thinking of!" and "Guess what car I'm thinking of!"   The bugs are evil there. I ultimately counted 24 bugbites, from at least 3 different types of bugs. I look like I'm carrying some disease - the USDA should have been checking me for bugs, not my luggage. I swear I now have dengue fever. Plus they itch like nothing else, and I naturally take great glee in mournfully announcing my utter pain. Combine this with the fact that I have these mysterious bruises on my arm, it looks like crankypants has been abusing me, which I like to point out often.    It is a small miracle, but there was  no  shopping done there at all. Nothing. Seems like a week on the beach is good - no, excellent - for my budget.    There are So Many cute dogs on the island, and they're all remarkably good-natured. There was the black one who would sleep underneath my beach chair. There was the golden retriever who would follow us up and down the beach at Ocean Park. There was the adorable chow mix who followed us up and down the beach on Culebra. But my favourites were those belonging to the house down the street from the hotel - three positively adorable little white dogs, each a different breed but each white and fluffy and so cuuuute. They loved me, I know. Especially since I would go talk to them every day. Crankypants thought this was very amusing, in a sort of indulgent "it's okay you're nuts" sort of way. But now I am back, and already desperately missing the beach. My new goal in life is to open up a hole-in-the-wall beach bar, way off the beaten track, and open only when people happen to find it. It would be the perfect idyllic life. Quite like living in Margaritaville.

      Refreshed from taking an hour-long nap, I decided to reattack the problem of packing.  However, I have a new problem: I believe I have too many pairs of shoes. Let's review:   One pair of black flipflops.  Well, these are absolutely necessary, so taking them out isn't an option.   One pair of black flat mules.  Because I don't want to bring sneakers, these are my "sporty" shoes.    One pair of black wedges.  Because I don't have a pair of open-toed black heels, these will have to suffice. I hope they don't give me blisters, I got them at the end of last summer and didn't have a chance to break them in. No time like the present.   One pair of black slingbacks.  They go with everything! And they have a 3.5 inch heel, ooh la la, so sexy. Miraculously, they're also very comfortable.   One pair of pink heels.  Maybe I could get rid of these, but they're so cute! Pink! 3 inch heel! And comfortable! How could I pass these up?   One pair of plum ballet flats.  Yes, these  could  be considered my sporty shoe, but if you saw them, you'd see that they're far too delicate and lovely to let anything like sand near them. But they are very good for walking around. However, since they're not black, they don't go with everything I own. Okay, that makes 6 pairs of shoes. For one week. That's really not  too  bad. Especially seeing that my strategy for choosing skirts and tops was everything I like for the former, and everything black for the latter. Needless to say, I think I've ended up with enough skirts for a month. But they all fit in my suitcase, so it's okay. You know that I'm going to end up living in my flipflops and one outfit anyway. But a girl has got to have options.

      Packing makes me sleepy. Nothing sends me to my bed with the intent of catching some zzz's than an open suitcase, waiting for me to fill it. It's like empty suitcases emit some sort of sleeping gas that, no matter how much energy I have beforehand, I'm positively sapped once I encounter one.  This makes packing for this trip, for which I'm leaving in a few scant hours, positively exhausting. Again, another reason why I need servants. I don't even want to think what'll happen when I have to move out of my apartment. Movers. Definitely hiring movers.

      Since I am leaving for PR TOMORROW (of course this is all I can talk about. It annoys people a lot. That makes it even more fun!), I decided to revisit the  urlLink to-do list  I made a week ago to see where I was on it.    Buy sunscreen.  Hahaha. I hate wearing sunscreen. And since the stuff I bought in Italy two years ago has probably expired, and the only place that sells sunscreen I like is *all the way on the other side of town, I guess this isn't happening. Although, I did tell crankypants this and he said that he would get sunscreen on me by force. I want to see him take me. I am more devious.    Lose 10 pounds.  As I sit here eating some homemade spaghetti carbonara, I repeat, hahaha. Like that was happening. When the only edible item in the hospital cafeteria is the grilled cheese, that they make right on the spot for you? How could anyone pass that up?!   Figure out if 4 bikinis are enough for 7 days.  This was a reluctant yes. But I didn't have enough time to go bikini shopping in the last week, surprise of all surprises. Not enough time to go shopping, you may ask. Sigh. I need someone to bring the bikinis to me, so that I don't have to go to the mall.    Buy enough books to last me a week.  Since this involves online shopping, it was all too easy. 7 books, not too shabby. I'll try to read slowly.    Restring my tennis racquet (and buy a new tennis outfit).  Surprisingly, my racquet is still in good shape. At least, it feels like it is, although I haven't picked it up in five years, so I could just be delusional as I so often am. But I'm not going to bring it, because it will take up the room that I could use for another pair of shoes. And then I couldn't find any cute pleated tennis skirts! The horrors! I can't settle for anything less, so I didn't end up buying a skirt. Sigh.    Find a summer job.  I'm so proud of myself, I actually sent out a couple of resumes. So I did  something , at least.   Pack.  HAH. Not by a long shot. True to form, I won't start packing until, oh, 2-or-so hours before I leave for the airport.   The sad result? I didn't get very far on the list, crossing several items off out of sheer laziness. But if I had checked off everything on the list (excepting perhaps the last item), I would have been very surprised, and wondered if I had been possessed. Then I'd have to deal with that whole exorcism thing, and that's never fun.

      Late last night, I had the most intense chocolate chip cookie craving, and since it was obviously too late to start baking, I went next door to my friend Kate's apartment in an attempt to convince her that we totally needed chocolate chip cookies at 10:30 at night. Luckily, she is very easily persuaded, and we hopped into my car to drive the four measly blocks to the bakery.  We were loud and giggly as usual, and on the way out, someone (okay, me) might have said a little too loudly, "Hey, did I tell you about the  urlLink cute freshman  from the other night?"  [note: scroll to end of post] at which point she was like, "Freshman? In college? What? You're a 2nd year med student!" (Not technically true, because I'm on leave, but we'll let it slide.)   This might seem otherwise unremarkable, except for the fact that the cute group of guys leaving the bakery at the same time paused in their tracks and one said, "You're both second year med students?" I just blinked, not really expecting outside participation in our conversation, and Kate pointed to me and said, "Not me! HER!" I smiled widely at him, because in the dim lighting, I thought he was one of my friend's hot friends, but then I realised I didn't know him at all when he responded, "Oh, we'll be at your medical school next year." (Long explanation short, there is a program by which certain people from a medical school up north come to mine for their clinical rotations.) Looking like a deer caught in headlights, I waved meekly - I mean, I think I had met these guys at an event awhile ago, and I'm sure I was drunk then, and I  had  just proclaimed loudly about the attractiveness level of a freshman, not to mention before that I might have been whining about how much my hand hurt because it took me 15 minutes to get the top off my Frangelico bottle so I could enjoy an aperitif, yes, by myself, earlier in the evening.  We were in hysterical laughter by the time we got into the car. But no, the story doesn't end there. We decided to cruise the main strip (all of 5 blocks) to find out where they were going next. The first loop around, we saw they had gone into a bookstore, but Kate was too chicken shit to get out of the car. So we drove around a SECOND time, at which point I pulled over and was like, "Come on, you're so going to regret it if you don't come inside with me." With a lot of muttering about how she was going to kill me, and also about how I have a boyfriend and shouldn't be driving around stalking random guys, I dragged her into the bookstore so that I could "buy some magazines." Conveniently, the guys just happened to be at the magazine rack, and one commented, "Hey, are you stalking us?" The thing is that while they were joking, this was the sad sad truth. So I blithely tossed off a comment along the lines of, "Why, we totally are, there's nothing else to do here on a Tuesday night." Sadly, again, this was the truth, although it sounded like a joke. Another responded with a "I'm glad we're coming here, this never happens to us back at our school," but by that point I was actually excited for the new issues of  In Style  and  Allure  and wasn't quite listening anymore. After picking out my precious magazines, I held a very nice and smiley conversation with them, all the while thinking,  I bet they're just thinking about what a big twit I am , and we parted ways saying, "See you next year!"  Oh my, this is another reason why I'm glad I'm not going to be here next year, although it would be great fun to become friends with them and then later say, "You know that night we ran into each other and you joked about me stalking you? I really  was  stalking you."   I need something better to do with my evenings.

      Given the choice of a day trip to  urlLink Vieques  or  urlLink Culebra , both islands off the eastern coast of Puerto Rico, I opted for the smaller of the two, Culebra, saying, "We can then rent bikes and bike from beach to beach!"  Yes, I actually used the word bike in the transportation sense of the word. I've gotta have some sort of virus, because why would I choose biking over renting a jeep on Vieques and just driving everywhere? I haven't been on a bike since junior year, when our abroad program sent us to Ile d'Yeu, a small island off the western coast of France, closest large city being Nantes. There was no way to get around the island except on bikes. I had to borrow sneakers because I obviously didn't bring any to Paris. Also, I have Barbie feet. They don't do well on bikes. Not to mention that I never remember which brake stops the back wheel and which stops the front wheel, so I don't use either and instead just take my feet of the pedals until I slow down enough so that I can place my feet on the ground. It was a disaster then. It's not going to be any better now.   But then, my momentary delusional spell over, I added, "Just so you know, I'm not bringing sneakers with me. I will bike in flipflops. And you can carry my stuff for me too."  Glad to know that all's okay in the land of high-maintenance.

      My mother always told me to find a guy who was more in love with me than me with him, to ensure his continuing faithfulness and loyalty. This is perhaps a slightly cynical look at the world of relationships, but, if I wanted this,  urlLink Nick  (Nick #1, if you're wondering) would fit this description to a tee.    Blahblahblah, I'm not going to rehash stuff I've said before, but am going to add that he's the only guy I have ever had  The Talk  with. Yes, that includes crankypants. No, one fine fall day our senior year, Nick and I actually had The Talk about the state of our (non-existent aside from friendship, at least in my eyes) relationship. Over two hours of him saying crap like, "Well, Boston and Providence are so far apart," and "I don't know why we didn't just start dating freshman year," and "well, we're seniors, it doesn't really make sense because I don't know where I'm going to be next year," and lots of me just nodding and trying not to fall asleep. Naturally, nothing got figured out, for various reasons: 1) he was dating someone else and 2) I wasn't interested in him.  Anyhow. Guess who was in town yesterday? Ah yes, Nick. His brother goes to the fine college here, and so for some reason or other, Nick decided to visit. The majority of the details of the day will be left out, because they're largely uninteresting and consisted of me just wanting to bash his skull in because he was being a pain. Suffice it to say that we went out to dinner with his brother and his brother's friends, which was rather amusing and had the end result of making me feel very, very, very old, as they're freshmen in college, with their entire college career ahead of them, housing dilemnas and class-choosing and all. And it's been two years now. Egads.   The fun parts of the day were when I'd mention crankypants, and Nick would just act like I hadn't said anything at all. "Oh, you're going to Puerto Rico?" he'd ask, picking up my guidebook, and I'd reply, "Yes, crankypants has spring break next week." But given the absolute lack of reaction, I could have been blowing air. While discussing cross-country drives at the dinner table, I threw in, "Oh, crankypants drives from Virginia to LA twice a year, it's such a haul," and all the other people at the table would have questions, but Nick would be sitting there eating food off my plate.  The absolute crowning point, however, was when I was driving him to the bus station so he could go, oh, I'm not even sure where, and he finally asked - after, oh, maybe 7 hours spent in each other's company: "So, how's that, uh, thing in Virginia going? It's been, uh, what, two years now?" That's right. That  thing . Call it a relationship. Use the guy's name, for crying out loud, I've been involved with him for long enough. But I was completely honest, and replied, "Oh, it's great, it works right now, you know?"  in that it works, the distance, miraculously somehow, isn't  that  horrific a problem. But how did Nick reply? "Do you see yourself breaking up with him in the near future?" Now, that, that just did not require a response. I just looked at him, and very exasperatedly responded "What I mean by that, is that even with the distance, it works. Not that we're going to break up anytime soon. Do people go into relationships anticipating the end? So, how are things with you and your ex?" Ah. Poor Nick. I'll probably be insanely jealous when he does finally meet someone else and falls madly in love with her. But that doesn't look like it's happening anytime soon, so I feel relatively safe.   The other amusing part of the night - well, perhaps amusing isn't it. As I dropped him off at the bus station, we discussed when we could see each other next. Since he's a busy busy consultant, he doesn't have many weekends free. So while figuring this out, he came out with, "You know, I've noticed this for the past six years we've known each other, but every once in awhile, usually when you're trying to work things through, your voice takes on this slightly nasally quality that makes it sound like you're crying." Okay, so I'm sure that I'm the only person over 18 who watched  Win a Date with Tad Hamilton , but there's this very charming scene where Topher Grace's character describes Kate Bosworth's character's six different smiles. Cheesy, yes, but it shows he knows her  that  well. So, while nasal voice isn't as charming as six smiles, it's rather cute that Nick's noticed this, except I swear, the only time my voice gets nasally is when I'm whining and trying to make a point, not all the time. But the worst part of all, is that Nick is calling my voice nasally.  urlLink Scarlett Ace  has heard the pleasure of hearing Nick speak. Nick has one of the  most  nasally voices ever, to the point where one of my friends, after meeting him, said, "Dear, you slept with that voice? How did you ever stand it?" It makes me want to cry, to hear him tell me that  my  voice is nasally, and now I want to sign up immediately for elocution lessons.   On a side note. Some of Nick's younger brother's friends were very cute and adorable, and remarkably good conversationalists. I don't remember me or any of my friends being so well-versed in so many topics when we were 18. Had the most delightful conversation with the very cute guy next to me about various artists, ranging from the 16th century to the modern day. Didn't hurt that his father owns three art galleries, in New York and LA. I had to keep reminding myself that he was only 18 - my sister's age, 5 years younger, barely legal. I can see it now. I am so going to be one of those older women who has younger lovers. It's okay. I've accepted my fate.

      So, the time has come, the walrus said, to talk of other things. Of birds and - oh, wait, I digress. The time has come to plan Brooke's bachelorette party, seeing that it's in about 2 months.   Plans were coming along swimmingly - we told the bride which weekend she needed to be home, and Megan (the Maid of Honor) sent out the invites. Katie told her father we wanted to use his beachhouse in San Juan Capistrano that weekend, and we all started plotting.  Grand plans! We'd get to the beachhouse late Friday night (since some of us work), have a nice dinner out full of alcohol, and then spend all Saturday on the beach or at a  urlLink spa , then make pizza using the nifty pizza oven, and then go out on the town. Then we'd spend Sunday sleeping off our hangovers on the beach until everyone departed mid-afternoon. Katie's father even offered to hire us male strippers and caterers, but we said No, Brooke wouldn't like that. (Because she is boring.)  Leave it to the bride to screw everything up.  Her first big mistake was having 3 (other) bridesmaids who are too lazy to fly across the country for the party. Fine. So be it. So there'll be a divide between the bridesmaids Brooke knew from high school (us), who are (naturally) infintely cooler than those bridemaids Brooke met in college (them). It's all their fault anyway, for not wanting to compromise at all.   But then her second - bigger - mistake is the following: She asked her boss for Friday off, so that she could spend maximum time in town for the party. Then her boss was super-nice and told her she could take either Thursday or Monday off as well, because it doesn't make sense to fly across the country for only three days.  The sensible considerate bride would have taken Monday off, so that we could spend  all  weekend on the beach.   But that's not Brooke. No. She took Thursday off. So she'll get in Wednesday evening, and leave Sunday morning.  It doesn't seem that big a tragedy. Except she apparently forgot the fact that people are working this summer. It doesn't matter how early she gets into town, we quite simply can't make it down to Orange County until Friday evening.   And Brooke will have to leave Saturday night so that she can make it to the airport early the next morning.  That's right, the bachelorette - THE BACHELORETTE - will have to leave her own party early.   But wait - isn't it obvious? All of us are supposed to take Friday off because our lives are but secondary to this momentous occassion (that being Brooke's wedding.)   So we planners are miffed because the bride herself is so white-paper bland that she is making her bachelorette party - that's right, a celebration of her few remaining months being single - as boring as possible.  I can't even get excited in the planning of this, and I love entertaining, because it already promises to be a very afternoon tea-type affair.   Whatever, so we'll all still be at the beachhouse on Sunday sleeping off our hangovers. We don't want a party pooper there, even if said party is for the pooper.

      ...hoping to find information about the Lewis Carroll poem, "Jabberwocky"  - I'm sorry. There seem to be a lot of you.   I chose Jabberwocky as a title because for me, it means utter nonsense. Much like the poem itself. And that's what this whole page is, utter nonsense.  However, I'm really sorry if you are here because you thought that I'd written some nice little essay explaining the poem that you wanted to use for "inspiration." After all, some of you do type in "analysis of jabberwocky", "example of a Jabberwocky about women" and "the main moral to jabberwocky" and end up here! I don't believe that those are particularly innocent searches. If you had thought to pass off my thoughts as your own, that's called plagarism. You can get in trouble for committing this particular little crime. All intellectual property (or lack thereof) you might have encountered here is aaaaaall mine.   But you know what? You're safe. I'm not writing about the poem at all. The last time I analysed it was in 7th grade. Thus, there is nothing that you can borrow for your work. Too bad! But you can probably hit up your junior high English teacher for help - then again, you should have been paying attention in class in the first place, shouldn't you have?  Then there are some of you who type in things like "NOAH WYLE HOME PHONE", "apple, orange, tomatoe, iq" and " 'each other' tank top palpate", and I don't really want to know what you're thinking. However, if you got here by searching for "hot teaching assistant," I do want to hear about that. Hot TAs sometimes make for good stories.  Lastly, for the person who looked for information on "hypochondria 'how do you get it' genes", if you have figured out the answer to your question, I would love to know.

      I wish I had something fun and interesting to write about. But really, I don't. I have become progressively stressed out because within the next month, before I fly home to lovely LA for the summer, these are the following things I have to deal with:  First and foremost, I have to pack up the apartment in which I've lived for the past three years. Then add the 3 years of stuff I carted from dorm room to dorm room. You can't even begin to guess the amount of stuff - really, crap - I have. I don't even want to know what I have stored in the basement. And I'm a sentimental fool and can't give any of it up.    Not only do I have to pack it, I have to divide it into five categories: 1) Stuff that gets moved to Cambridge (only the absolute essentials, I swear) 2) Stuff that gets sent home in crankypants's car (china, glassware, and as many shoes and purses as I can fit) 3) Stuff that gets shipped (books, and anything that doesn't fit in crankypants's car.) 4) Stuff that I will take home myself (those clothes and shoes I cannot be separated from for more than 24 hours, which is sadly a lot) 5) Stuff to give away (things I really don't need after all). There is not nearly enough stuff in the last category, and too much in the previous four. I used an entire Sunday  New York Times  to wrap breakables, and still am not done. Why does a drunken klutz like me have so many fragile items? Also, I have more shoes and purses than I know what to do with. Why? I have but one pair of feet and two hands.   I have only 4 weekends left before I fly home, and one will be spent in NY and one in Wisconsin. Unfortunately, the one spent in Wisconsin is the last weekend I have before going home. When in the hell am I going to move all my furniture?   Then, there is still working on this  urlLink cholesterol research project , doing more research for an education professor here, oh, and a French one too, and also working at the French-American school.   Of course, I cannot leave Providence without having one last meal at all of my favourite restaurants here. Unfortunately, the list gets longer and longer. I have at least 5 "must" places on the list, and at least 10 more "if I have time, and I really hope I do" places, and everyone is studying for his/her Boards, dammit, so can't take time off for a leisurely wine-filled dinner.    Go to Newport. I don't go nearly enough, and it's only an hour away. What are the odds that I'll go if I'm any further away?   Go to the doctor's and have her attempt to convince me, Little Miss Hypochondriac, that I, in fact, am not suffering from  urlLink hypothyroidism . But look, I have most of the symptoms! I left medical school at the worst time - had enough schooling to learn about all the various diseases and problems, yet didn't stay long enough to start ruling them out. I have post-it notes (what marvelous inventions! I don't know what I'd do without them!) All Over My Apartment - some are lists, some are instructions, some are reminders. And to make things even worse, I don't seem to be able to stop shopping. Really, what's wrong with me? I'm supposed to be getting rid of stuff, not acquiring.   Sniffle, this is when I really desperately need servants. Really, I'll pay good money - and even throw in a home-cooked meal or three! - if someone else handles all of this for me.

      ..when you have munchkins of your own someday, and want to know the lazy person's way to effectively deal with them. (All derived from my experiences watching over the 4-6 year olds at the French-American School. They don't work as well on my little cousins, primarily because I'm family and they don't understand French so I can't fall back on that.)   Playtime   Scenario: The children are throwing rubber balls twice the size of their heads at each other.  What you say: Children, no! Do not throw the balls at heads or arms or legs! You may only throw them at the chest! Reason: Kids have awful aim, so if they aim for the chest, they usually end up hitting the stomach, where there is lots of baby fat still protecting them. Thus, it hurts less. Any other parts are more suspectible to harm, which results in crying, and crying must be avoided at all costs. Outcome: This works really well, because they're still allowed to attack each other, which keeps them out of your hair. You know you've taught them well when you hear them yell at each other, "Aim for my chest, stupid!"    Fights   Scenario: Child A has called Child B a crybaby.  What you say: Do you think you're a crybaby? Reason: Because Child B usually  is  a crybaby, but you can't really agree with Child A now, can you? But this question makes Child B think about it for a little and usually confuses him/her, and very often, staves off the tears.  Outcome: Usually, Child B will just say "no!" and resume playing. If s/he starts crying (this is a likely outcome also, unfortunately), see "Crying," below.   Crying   Scenario: Some prima donna of a brat didn't get his/her way and lets everyone know by fully demonstrating his/her lung capacity.  What you say: Go find the  ma&icirc;tresse  and tell her what happened.  Reason: Well, you're not the one really in charge, are you? No, you're just the assistant. Outcome: You have diverted the crying one away from you. Otherwise, you get a little runny-nosed teary brat sitting on your lap whom you have to spend a good half-hour consoling as she (because face it, it's usually a whiny little girl) chokes out, "He... he... he took my .... jump rope, but I.. I... " You get the idea.    Drawing time   Scenario: Child wants you to draw him/her a picture of something, say, a butterfly.  What you say: So what do you think a butterfly looks like? Why don't you show me? Reason: You're too lazy to draw and help them out. Plus, this fosters creativity. Outcome: Be glad, you have enabled a future Picasso to practice his/her craft.   When the child wants something   Scenario: Not content with markers/snacks/racing cars/paper airplanes, the child wants you to do something for him/her.  What you say:  En fran&ccedil;ais, s'il te pla&icirc;t?  Reason: This is a French-American school. The kids are technically supposed to speak in French, and this way you're helping them practice. Outcome: You get to sit on your lazy ass for another few minutes as the child tries to figure out how to make his/her request in French. Sometimes it takes awhile and they forget what they even wanted in the first place.  Note: These might not seem as though they'd work, but said with a smile and a tone of childish conspiracy, they do. And the other teachers look upon you with awe as all your little children seem to be extraordinarily self-sufficient and well-behaved while simultaneously having fun. Plus, the kids love this sort of tough love. I have all sorts of pictures they've drawn for me up on my fridge as proof of this. Minimal effort for maximum results. However, when they start declaring that they only want to play with you, you know you're too good at this.

      So, I corrected the link to the  urlLink drinking man's diet , because I realise that it was wrong below, and I want everyone to see the genius behind this diet. After sending it to multiple friends as like, the best diet ever, I have been informed that I actually have been eating like this for the past several years. Good to know.  Anyhow, it's strange to think that after six years of living in Providence, I'm going to leave and (most likely) never come back (to live that is, I'm sure I'll visit.) I'm not very good at adapting to change. I like staying in one place for long periods of time, because it's comfortable. (See: elementary school 6 years, el-hi for 9, then college/med for another 6. I have also spent nearly all of my life in school.) Plus, I hate moving with a passion.  Anyway, back to my point. I don't think it had hit me that I was leaving, yet. At least, not until I talked to Stan at a party Saturday night, and he said, "So, you're leaving Providence? That's it? I might never see you again."   This just put me in a state of shock. Not see him again? I mean, Stan was the first person I met at college, whilst moving into my freshman dorm. And sure, we've grown apart a bit over the past year, mainly due to his acquiring a girlfriend who was jealous of our relationship. But, I don't think that it ever crossed my mind that I'd never see him again.  Yet, that's reality. There are people with whom you were  so  close once upon a time. But for some reason or another - moving, fighting, sulking, just plain laziness, whatever - you never see or hear from them again. Perhaps you don't mean for it to happen - but one day you wake up, and realise that one, two, five years have passed in the blink of an eye.   And then you feel like it's too late. That you should have made more of an effort before, but now that so much time has passed you really can't, you'll look like a moron. Or maybe the other person has forgotten about you. Or maybe s/he is mad at you and doesn't want to talk. Or maybe it's really his/her turn to call. Or, or, or, or... there are always so many excuses.  I've been on both ends. I've been the one who, deliberately or not, has stopped contacting people. It's usually a childish reason - well, harumph, they don't bother emailing/calling/writing me, why should I put the same effort towards them?! And then, I've been the one who doesn't get called/emailed/written. And then I just feel put out, and well, far be it from me to contact the other first. And so the vicious cycle continues.  Maybe I should be less petty, but you know what? I'm not, and while I realise that it's a major character flaw,  tant pis .   And as a somewhat resolution to Stan's comment, I pouted and told him I wasn't talking to him again until he promised to visit me in Cambridge next year, which seeing that it's a mere hour's drive, really isn't too much of a strain. Of course he promised me that, I get what I want about 95% of the time due to mere tenacity and because I'm me.

      I have to admit, I was super-excited to see this. Yes, I knew it was a remake of  Big , but since I never saw that... and this looked cute... and I love me my romantic comedies.  Okay, I think everyone knows the premise of the  urlLink movie , unless you've been hidden in a cave somewhere you don't get electricity and have no contact with the outside world. But in case you don't, Jenna Rink is 13. But she wants to be 30. (Why 30? Even when I was little I never wanted to be 30. As a matter of fact, I plan on stopping the aging process at 24, which will be later this year.) 30 means you're flirty and lord knows what else. To make matters short, her childhood friend, Matt Flamhaff (what an unfortunate last name!) gives her a "dream house" he has built for her, along with some wishing dust. Suffice it to say that her birthday party doesn't go as planned, and she wishes fervently to become 30. Lo and behold, the wishing dust works, and she wakes up, Jenna Rink, played by Jennifer Garner, bigtime magazine editor.   So on, and so forth. She realises that her old 30-self was mean, conniving, back-stabbing, husband-stealing, etcetc. But no longer! Not with this 13-year-old mind ruling her! No, she's gonna make things right, and that includes re-finding Matt, the grown-up version played by Mark Ruffolo, and doing whatever else she needs to do to make everything okay again. Then come some realisations, some crying, some more fairy dust, and Mr. and Mrs. Flamhaff live happily ever after in a life-sized replica of the pink dream house he had built for her so many years ago! (Gosh, what a  horrible  last name!)  I really cannot stand Jennifer Garner, nor could any of my friends, so I'm not sure why we decided to see this movie. Oh yeah, we though we could tolerate her for the greater good of the movie. This Was Not The Case At All. After spending 15 minutes watching Jennifer Garner attempt to precociously find her footing in this new world, we just waited for the movie to be over. She walks like she has a stick up her ass. She attempts to be overly coy, overly charming - I don't care what people think, she is  not  going to be America's next sweetheart,  &agrave; la  Julia Roberts. She's even more annoying than Ms. Roberts/Mrs. Moder. Jennifer Garner strikes me as being too pandering, too "look at me I'm  cute!!!! " too.. I don't know, pink cotton candy. Not that I have anything against cotton candy. She just annoys me with her simpering ways.  The only thing that made this movie worthwhile: the accessories and her closet. Unfortunately, there was only one shot of her closet, but it made us drool. It was an enormous walk-in. Floor to ceiling handbags and shoes. Lots of cool clothes (and why did she only choose to wear the ugly outfits?) She had this great silver Fendi baguette that I would have  died  for. Then there was this Chanel handbag. And in the wonderland of all closets, I saw last season's Gucci bamboo bag that I desperately wanted but couldn't warrant spending over $1000 for.   This movie had so much potential. So many 80s songs. ("Thriller" is still in my head, as we speak.) With such great 80s songs, how could it go wrong? But go wrong it horribly did. It was a long, drawn-out, overly cliched movie. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, obviously, but I wanted it to be satisfying, in the manner of  The Prince and Me  and  Win a Date with Tad Hamilton! . Maybe it's because I didn't think Mark Ruffolo was cute, who knows. But the ending was the  worst  ever too. Fairy dust doesn't make everything go away.   In summary, this was a piece of crap and we wished we had been able to keep drinking during it to make the pain go away. It killed the buzz we'd gotten from our morning Bellinis, which was just not good at all. Oh, but the bags. The handbags  almost  (but not quite) made it worth it after all.

      Really, the only reasons I have for picking up this book are the following: 1) I was bored, 2) I was too lazy to go to the bookstore to buy books and 3) I had already read all the other books that my friend Stephanie has, except for this one. So,  urlLink Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea  it was.   It is a rather interesting idea - as the back of the book reads, "For centuries, the power of zero savored of the demonic; once harnessed, it became the most important tool in mathematics.  Zero  follows this number from its birth as an Eastern philsophical concept to its struggle for acceptance in Europe and its apotheosis as the mystery of the black hole." And it has very good reviews, although I know that all book review quotes found on books should be taken with a grain of salt.  And while it is indeed a fascinating topic, this is definitely not the book to read for that half-hour before you go to sleep. Usually by then, my mind is too groggy to really pay attention, and I can't follow anything more complex than a trashy novel.  The author, Charles Seife, is a journalist with  Science  magazine. He starts at the very beginning: life before zero. If you didn't think that life existed without zero - well, apparently the Egyptians didn't use the concept of zero. Nor did the Greeks. It was actually the Babylonians who used zero, but only as a placeholder. It didn't have meaning at that point. The Mayans used it too (and had funky glyphs for each digit, which I can only imagine made writing out numbers hard.) In India and the Arab lands, however, zero was a concept embraced, and it was the Indians who actually made use of zero as more than just a placeholder, giving it the power of any other number. Zero was finally reintroduced to Europe in the 1400s, although by no means was it accepted, especially by the church.    The book goes on to describe how important a concept and number zero is, and how without it, we would have such things as calculus (which wouldn't be too bad, I think, I hated calculus) nor the concept of infinity, nor physics (again, would be it be bad if we didn't have physics?).   It's all very fascinating, but unfortunately in parts the author gets too technical and mathematical, which makes for inherently dry reading matter. If you can sludge through those parts, the book on the whole is relatively rewarding reading, as it's short but interesting, and if you can remember concepts from it, you can sound really smart at cocktail parties.

      From  urlLink Reuters.com :  urlLink You Really May Be Addicted to that Chocolate Cake  So my food addiction would be akin to a drug abuse problem. Really, it makes so much sense now, why I am  always  (and I do not exaggerate) thinking about food. This is why I make restaurant reservations as far in advance as I can get them. I like to know where my next meal is coming from. I avidly read restaurant reviews for all cities I frequent. (Because as a "jetsetter" - haha - there  are  multiple cities.) You'd have thought that I was starved while growing up, but nothing could be further from the case. If you ask any one of my friends, they'll vouch for the fact that I think about food at least 50% of the time. It's more like 75%, actually. (The rest of the time, I think of shopping, of  the  urlLink cute white fluffy puppy  I will someday own and of how my tan lines have sadly faded.)   Please note the most favourite food items listed in the article:   bacon-egg-cheese sandwich . Check. It combines all the great foodstuffs into one easy-to-eat package.   cinnamon bun . Not so much, although this  urlLink bakery  down the street makes the most amazing "old-fashioned cinnamon buns," which are nothing more than a vehicle for sugar and cinnamon.   pizza . OhmyGod, check, underline twice and circle. I am on a monstrous pizza rampage right now. So bad, that I've even started buying microwave pizzas so I won't have to change out of my pjs to satisfy my craving. And I'm actually enjoying the microwave pizzas. (Note: Those Lean Cuisine ones, with the "crispy crust"? Like all diet food, they are gross and taste like cardboard.)   hamburger with cheese . Definitely check. There is nothing like a nice, juicy, medium-rare burger, with a slice of melted cheese. I'd also like saut&eacute;ed mushrooms and caramelised onions on top, please.   fried chicken . Check. Mm. I love fried chicken. There's nothing quite like it. I admit to frequenting KFC every once in awhile. Plus, their buttermilk biscuits are  amazing .    lasagna . Finally, something that I don't crave. I'm sure I could, if I thought enough about it.    Bar-Be-Que rib . Check and star! There is not enough BBQ in this world. I'm going to assume that this category includes pulled pork, because that is one of my all-time favourite things to eat. Not North Carolina style, which has this vinagry sauce, but with lots of BBQ sauce. But I like ribs too, even if they're a tad messy.    ice cream . Thankfully, I'm not a big ice cream person. But I do like French vanilla. And Mint and Chip. I just never get cravings for it.   brownie . The same goes for brownies.   chocolate cake . What's the difference between chocolate cake and brownies? The shape? The amount of chocolate within? Now this has only served to make me hungry again, dammit. But I'm glad that there's a scientific explanation for all of this, it makes me feel much better. The metabolism in my brain has gotta be racing faster than a sprinter right now. (Sorry for the poor analogy, I couldn't think of anything else.) I will happily volunteer for the next stage of this study, if there is one. Believe me, what you'd get out of my brain would be priceless, I'm sure.   Incidentally,  urlLink  this   is the diet I should be on. It lets me drink lots! Please note: ...most of the things you like best don't have to be counted at all: steak and whisky, chicken and gin, ham, caviar, pâté de foie gras, rum and roast pheasant, veal cutlets and vodka, frogs legs and lobster claws--they all count as zero. I am in heaven.

      Keep in mind that I have nothing better to do with my time. So when I came across  urlLink this item  on  urlLink Gawker  about cuddle parties, I knew that it had to be incorporated into some sort of prank.  But first, the research. Off to the  urlLink official website . Look, they give you rules on how to host a cuddle party. My favourite rule is:  The Erection Phenomenon: If something "comes up" during the party, it's okay. We may be adults, but boys will be boys, so let's just declare that getting an erection is just getting an erection and not something weird or nasty. The cultural stigma surrounding sex, touch, and adults in intimate groups is bound to have all kinds of things rising to the surface, emotional as well as physical, during a Cuddle Party, so let's just recognize erections for what they are: naturally occurring phenomenon. Should they occur, let's make them mean nothing more than Mother Nature's whimsical way of giving us the thumbs-up! Okay, enough of that. If you want all the rules, you can go to the website yourself. Dude, the guy went to Brown. Why do we turn out such weirdos. Anyhow..  I sent the link to Kevin, and he asked "Can we have a cuddle party after dinner?" referring to that night in New York in a couple of weeks when we're having this massive get-together. After some making fun of the concept (how can you not?), he said, "How the HELL did you find this, if I might ask? I think you were searching for stuff to do with crankypants, and you wanted my validation that this would be a good idea..." and before he could say (okay, type, this was all over IM) another word, that lightbulb of boredom-inspired genius lit up.   "I am going to email this to him," I typed, "And pretend that I'm serious!"   "Beat me to it," he responded.  And so, it begins.   Kevin is a master stooger. Senior year, he lived with two other guys and a girl. One of the guys, Brian, had a girlfriend, and thus was always out of the apartment - and the rest of them took this time to prank him. Amongst my more favourite pranks are: when they froze all of Brian's boxers - but, they were clever enough to add water to the ziploc bag before freezing it, so he had to wait for it to all melt before he could dry them to wear them. Then there was the time they got a "fake brick wall" (I'm not really sure what it was made of, I never saw this one), and nailed it inside Brian's door, so that when he opened his door he saw a wall and couldn't get in.   So, with Kevin's help, the following email was sent to crankypants: So, I was talking to Karina about stuff to do on Friday night in NY, and she suggested this thing called a cuddle party. (www.cuddleparty.com) She claims it's all the rage in New York and she said that she and her boyfriend have tried it and they love it. They talked about having one with their friends and she thought our dinner would be a good start, wine, cosy place, etc. I think it's a cool idea, what about you? Want to get a hotel in the vicinity of the LES, so that we can facilitate this? Really, Kevin's genius is wasted in the field of engineering. He could rival Ashton Kutcher with the level and quality of his stooging.   However, we forgot that we're working against a master. Crankypants's favourite hobby is "stirring the pot." And he knows that I wallow in sarcasm. His response was: That sight [sic] is the funniest thing I've seen in a long, long time.  We hicks from Wisconsin have another word for the result of (a) alcohol, (b) cramped spaces, (c) lots of people, and (d) touching each other.  It's called an ORGY.  My favorite are the tips that the dude gives to emphasize that it's not an orgy; i.e. it's O.K. to kiss, but you have to ask first.... I do think it would be an awesome way to stir the pot, though!  Stir the pot my ass. The big guns are coming out, at this point. He thinks I'm joking? And he's going to try to call me on this? Just watch how much I'm joking.   Before I had time to come up with a witty response (read: consult Kevin), crankypants called, and while we were discussing New York plans, he casually said, "Yeah, I don't know if I'm going to invite this conservative southern guy to dinner because if the cuddle parties happen, he might not be so cool with it."  Oh my! Is he trying to outpunk me? The thing is, I couldn't tell at all. Usually, I can tell if he's joking, but this was completely deadpan, as if he were serious. Now, if he actually  was  serious, I'd start freaking out. So to prevent this, I languished in denial and decided that I have to take it as though he was only pretending to be serious.  Of course, what do you do in this situation? You ask yourself:  What would Kevin do?   Because really, that should be my motto in life. And everyone else's, but not everyone is lucky enough to know him.  But since I do know Kevin, I have the benefit of going straight to the source for advice. And this is the email that we came up with: Since you sounded so open to the idea over the phone, I got in touch with REiD about having him host our cuddle party, but he said he only feels comfortable if he's seen pictures of the people first. So I sent him a picture of us, and he said that I was a very lucky person to have such a cute boyfriend, and he asked me if I'd ever consider sharing you at the party. Oh, and he assented to hosting the party at his apartment too, isn't that great?! If that doesn't freak him out and call his bluff, I don't know what will.  Like I said, I really need something better to do with my time.

      In a  urlLink continuing series , I present you with the second entry in Brooke's wedding diary. Dear Diary,  Yesterday, Mark and I went out with another couple we met last week at a cocktail party. Of course they are married - gosh, I love it that all my friends are married now, I get such useful tips on how to successfully manage my own marriage. Because you know, it's just as hard as holding down a fulltime job. Or even harder, as a matter of fact. After all, I have to keep my man happy - that's numero uno. Every day I make sure that there is a glass of the freshly-squeezed orange juice from Whole Foods that he likes, as well as something to snack on while he checks his email when he gets home. I'm off to a good start, I've been told :)   The other day, one of my friends from high school asked if I had only married friends, and wow, I tried thinking so hard if any of Mark's friends from college/law school were single, but I couldn't come up with a single name! She must just be bitter that she's not married yet. After all, isn't this what we were bred to do? Besides, then she has nobody to take care of. That must make her very sad :(   Anyway back to Saturday night.  I got so drunk, I can't believe it!!! I swear I only had three white wine spritzers, but hooey, did I feel it! I must have been making an absolute fool of myself, falling all over Mark and other people. At one point, I think that my pearls got entangled in the buttons of someone else's twinset, and it took ages to get us untangled! Teehee. Then we went home, and I was all ready to get it on with my beloved, but then I fell asleep while I was in the bathroom doing number two. Next time, I promise I'm going to limit myself to only one white wine spritzer, because I was sick the entire next day :( I need to remember to heed Mom's advice that women in our family have a very low tolerance - but gee, those spritzers tasted like grape juice, they were so sweet! :)  In other news, Mark and I finally picked out our wedding bands!!! It took  ages  to find appropriate ones, and while Mom wasn't there to help us choose, I was on the phone with her the entire time. Thankfully, Mom and I got camera phones so that I could instantly send pictures of our options to her! I don't know what we'd do without these marvelous inventions. It's so hard not having her here by my side when I have to make such important decisions! :(   So the decision came down between a plain yellow gold band and a gold band with pronged diamonds. It was such a difficult choice, but I eventually went with the one Mom chose. After all, Mark did say it was my decision. While he definitely preferred the first one, we ended up choosing the second ring. It's such a bling ring :)  He's going to be a lawyer, I might as well have rings befitting a lawyer's wife!! :) Anything less would simply not do, Mom says. She should know, she's married to a lawyer. And she knows best.  Then we made scallops and orange roughy to celebrate buying the rings :) Actually, Mark made them because even though Mom signed me up for a cooking class, all we learned how to do was to dice vegetables and make stock. But the scallops were amazing. I love scallops! Their colour reminds me of the colour of my wedding dress :) The orange roughy was so tender too, and such a pretty white. I wonder what Mom would say if I wanted all the food at the wedding to be white. Actually, that wouldn't go with the colour scheme at all, and Mom spent so long finding the perfect blue ribbons for the programs. Maybe the second bridal shower can feature all-white food. To remind people of the purity and sanctity of the event :)   Our sixth year anniversary is this weekend :) I can't believe it's only been six years, it feels as though we've been together forever :)   Love, Brookie :) :)  I was IMing with Brooke yesterday, and honestly, every single line she typed in had a happy face. There's gotta be some tool that dismantles the emoticon possibility on other people's IMs, so that they stop using them.

      Gosh, look at what my horoscope says for today: A team of cosmic influences are doing their best to talk you into canceling your appointments and spending the day doing nothing more taxing than deciding what to eat and which video to watch next. If you can, give in. Like I'm going to have any problems with that.   Anyway, seeing that I just got back from the gym, I thought I'd take some time to rant about super-annoying annoyances that take place there. So, in no particular order, the top three classes of people who should get shot if they commit any of the following grievances:   People who wear perfume or other scented materials.  Yes, body odor is gross, but since the gym is so big, you usually aren't inflicted with that nasty smell. However, what is particularly noxious and does  not  dissipate in the air is when someone gets onto the elliptical trainer next to you reeking as though she owns the entire line of Bath and Body Works scented products in what I can only surmise was a nasty putrid flowery pear. Every time I inhaled, I got a noseful of cloying fumes. I was ready to pass out, but I only had another 10 minutes left to my workout and so I was determined to get through them, pear-scented air or not. However, I did shoot her a whole bunch of dirty looks.     People who talk.  If you want to talk to your friends, fine. But if you get on the machine next to me and try to strike up a conversation, you will only get death glares and grunts. I am not at the gym to make friends, unless you're under the age of 35 and hot. If you do not fit both categories, don't even try to engage me in conversation. I don't want to hear bout how you can't read while on the elliptical (I can, so there!), and how you don't know where to go for spring break, Mr. Middle School Teacher. I really don't care. All I care about is sweating through these 45 minutes and then stretching and going home. It's even more annoying when you finally realise that after 10 minutes of monologue that I'm not going to respond, so you try to talk to the person on the Other Side of me. Didn't you read the studies where if you talk, you don't get as good a workout? No wonder you have problems losing those last 10 pounds.     People who don't wipe down the machines after their workout.  This is just rude and uncouth. Nobody else wants to share your gross sweat, and I'm sure that you don't want to share their's. So be courteous and take those 2 minutes to spritz the machine down with the cleaning spray that the gym has so kindly provided. I'm sure it really doesn't kill bacteria, and is nothing more than blue-coloured water, but it eases the mind. And you're at least removing some of your gross sweat in the wiping action. During my workout today, I counted that 75% of the people who finished their workouts did not wipe down their respective machine. I would be more than happy to come equipped with a whistle so that I could use it anytime anyone has commited this infraction. It would be fun.  But I'm clean and showered now, and feeling rather virtous that I went to the gym this morning - so now I have to decide what I want for breakfast - eggs over easy, or leftover pizza? It's such a difficult decision, thankfully my horoscope says not to strain myself any more than that.

       urlLink This article  has been making the rounds lately. If you are too lazy to click on the link, it essentially says that "people who drink more than 100 drinks a month have some problems." Well, yes. If you are drinking 100 drinks/month, that is three and one-third drinks a day. Wait, that's not so much, if you really think about it. It's like, most of a bottle of wine. Indeed, problems.   Anyhow, the article goes on to say that heavy social drinkers suffer from brain damage, just as much as chronic heavy drinkers do. This does not bode well for me at all, but I guess it's true. Look at the lapses in good judgement that happen whenever I drink.  Take Saturday night, for example. I was all ready to make  urlLink bulgogi  and  urlLink coconut rice , and to settle in front of the television to watch  urlLink  Miss Congeniality  , which I think is a much underrated movie. And there was going to be No Alcohol Involved, as part of my plan to lead a healthier life.   But then, Stephanie called, saying that a table had been reserved for twelve at a local restaurant/club, and that one of the spots was for me. Way to consult me on dinner plans. But how could I say no? And to make things even better, both Stan, who has been in love with me for awhile now (I might have slept with him last year when I was really really drunk. Maybe. Who knows)  and  Antonio (who is really hot, Portuguese and owner of land in Portugal. And he races cars in his free time, and I really should have taken him up on his offer last year for a home-cooked steak dinner, damn being faithful, bleh) were going to be there, along with a bunch of other guys in the medical school. 3 girls, 9 guys. Great ratios, absolutely great. They were supposed to "watch our backs", in case we got hit on by skeezy locals. But really, shouldn't they have been watching out for us - not in the sense of protecting us, but in the sense that perhaps some of us would eventually consume more alcohol than needed and just let common sense fly.   We ate, we talked, we drank. Boy did we drink.   So now, all I remember is a lot of dancing, some teasing Stan and well, not much else. I think Steph might have ended up getting in a fight with someone's friend, I'm not quite sure. It is really bad of me to use Stan's affection for me for my amusement, but hey, I didn't ask for it, so I might as well have some fun with it. Plus, he's a sweetheart. And he wants me. So you know, get a little alcohol in me, and all bets are off. At least I didn't call when we all finally parted ways at 3AM. I was going to, you know, make sure he got home okay. And all that jazz. But then I thought better. Or rather, fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow, thereby letting all "bad" ideas alone.   But I swear, I'm going to give up drinking one of these days. Someday soon. As soon as I take up an Amish lifestyle.

      There is nothing quite like sitting out in the park on a nice sunny day, with a baguette, some  urlLink good French butter , salami, and some  urlLink p&acirc;t&eacute; campagne . It makes for a quite elegant spread. All I needed to finish it off was some wine and cornichons, but apparently you can't have open bottles in parks here, hrmph, and ever since crankypants likened  urlLink cornichons  to little herpes-infected cucumbers, I've never been able to look at them in the same way again. So I had lemonade, and no cornichons. There might have been a touch of vodka in the lemonade, but who knows.   Does this mean that spring has finally arrived in the Northeast? At this point, I'd be happy to skip spring and go straight to summer, then I won't go around misplacing my coat everywhere.

       urlLink This  is pretty funny. Find out what others think of your prestigious university (as if you didn't already know.)   On a related note, take  urlLink this quiz  to see what Ivy League school fits you best/should have gone to.   For me, depending on my level of facetiousness, it alternates between Princeton (You're smart, you're thin, you're pretty, and goddamit, people love you. You are destined for great, great things, little Princetonian. Let there be a never-ending stream of Country-Club-Like institutions in your unmarred future.) and Penn (You were a hard-working wannabe cool kid, and now you are at the Ivy Leage [sic] equivalent of a rich, suburban high school, and all of the kids used to be too hard-working to be cool, so now you all pretend to be cool together. As long as Daddy keeps sending you money and you keep that coke habit in check, you're degree will mean something someday, even if none of your classes did.)   I don't know what this says about me. Incidentally, if you choose all the weed-related questions, you get Brown. Now really, that's not quite true. After all, didn't  Vanity Fair  describe Brown as a place full of eurotrash and artsy rich kids? And as everyone knows,  Vanity Fair  is always right. Always.

      Actually, I really don't. I like to go and visit people, but that's it. I'd never live there. But crankypants is almost done with school, which means that we get to take what's become an annual trip there together.  The  urlLink hotel  reservations have been made. People have been contacted.  urlLink Places   urlLink to   urlLink eat   have been chosen. (Yes, I am that anal that I will make dinner reservations a month in advance.) Even tentative  urlLink day  and  urlLink evening  plans have been drawn up.   Now, poop. Won't it be May already so crankypants will be done with his exams and we can go and get well and drunk in New York? Oh, right, it's all about the culture. Not about the drinking. Because New York is teeming with culture and not drunken people. Or maybe it all coexists.  Pfft, am tired of Providence. Maybe I'll head down sometime soon, before this mini-vacation. The advantages of having an ultra-flexible working schedule and not being in classes. It's rather lovely.

      ..Because, really, even though it's one of your closest friend's birthday and all, did you really feel the need to consume the majority of a magnum of pinot grigio? And then open up another bottle? Really? On an empty stomach?   Because this means that drunk you will just go home and decide that everyone needs a long long email written in French. Just because you miss Paris and France doesn't mean that everyone else does. As a matter of fact, most of your friends don't even read French. Oops.   But then you have go to work the next day. And that's just never a good idea with a hangover. Silly silly girl.   Well, it's time to see if those little hangover candies bought at Whole Foods work. Report on those later.

      If you must fly on the eastern seaboard, avoid the Philly airport at all costs. In all the times that I've flown through there over the past 6 years, I daresay I've had one flight leave on time. They have no idea how to correctly direct air traffic, and like to leave planes circling overhead for upwards of 2 hours. Add bad weather into the mix, and you could be circling for years.   Anyway, that out, onto the topic  du jour .  I admit it. I'm a dork. I love linguistics. I love relating languages to each other and seeing how they develop. What I hate, however, are books on the topic that are so dry, dense and boring that they send me screaming to an issue of  Vogue  so that I can bask in its utter banality and look at the pretty pictures of pretty dresses. But I digress. I was in my  urlLink second home  the other day, and decided to pick up  urlLink  The Power of Babel  , by John McWhorter, assistant professor of linguistics at Berkeley. The back of the book looked really promising: In this entertaining romp through territory too often claimed by stodgy grammarians, McWhorter ranges across linguistic theory, geography, history, and pop culture to tell the fascinating story of how thousands of very different languages have evolved from a single, original source in a natural process similar to biological evolution... It goes on, but you can find it in a bookstore yourself and read the rest. The reviews also sounded really good, the words "lively," "provocative," "fascinating," "entertaining" and "witty" used liberally.   Now, the fact that I fell asleep 6 times in the 4 hours I spent on this book probably had more to do with the fact that I was sitting outside in the nice Virginia countryside basking under a warm sun, than due to any shortcomings on the part of the book. Because the book is well-written, although personally I found it a little spastic, jumping around from subject to subject a little too quickly for me. I suppose it had to be suchly, because he uses a lot of languages in order to prove his points. Also, he uses footnotes to add personal opinion, which I found rather annoying. For example: "Yes, I am concocting these terms for our purposes. If you really want to know, I am referring to something many linguists would call degrees of  anticausative prominence ." (p. 124) Don't talk down to me, if I'm picking up your book it's because I want to learn something, I don't want to be treated like an idiot. Another example: "Chimpanzees have always made me extremely uncomfortable." (p. 294) I'm sorry, I know now that if I ever meet you I won't mention chimpanzees. Why? What place do such confessionals have in a book on linguistics? Don't use footnotes to add more personal interjections to a book already filled with personal anectdotes.   On the whole, for a book classified under the topics "linguistics/science" it is rather good and much more accessible than "popular" books on the same topic. But like I said, I'm a dork and I like such subjects. If you are looking for light beach reading this book is not for you.

      So I've mentioned Kevin several times before. He's my partner-in-crime, and since he is always online at work we talk a lot and scheme, and I set him up with my friends and he gives me (sometimes useful, more often not useful) advice about how to deal with crankypants. But this - this was priceless. I couldn't have made the following up, it was too funny. This is more or less a verbatim transcript from a voicemail he left me at 4AM Sunday morning.   A bit of background: he likes his girls tall and blonde, but lately has been having issues finding such, and has "loosened" his standards. This unfortunately includes seeing, amongst others, a short jewish girl who jerked him around for a couple of weeks until he ended things with her. He, incidentally, is not jewish. Both of these facts might help with comprehension of his very irate and confused early-morning call (I warn you now, this is not PC, it's not censored, it's just the drunken ravings of a very frustrated 24-year-old male. So if you're going to be insulted reading it, just stop.) Aw dude what the fuck's going on man, it's not fair. It's fuckin' - I told you it's Danielle's birthday, it's been 2 years in a row I've hooked up with a tall blonde, I was supposed to come in with a tall blonde, what happens? Short. Jewish Girl. What the fuck? Why why why why why? Why do jewish girls love me? Why, why it's not fair. This girl, even, fucking, she's like one of Danielle's, um, friends from since like sixth grade. So it's like I'm fuckin' fucked from the beginning. But, so now we're like  making out outside the bar and now she's trying to get me to go home with her and I'm like nah, it's not a good idea, and she's also like if you come home with me, you have to behave, who the fuck says stuff like that? She's short - ugly jewish girl, dude. It'd be different if she was cute, but she's a little chunky. But at the same time, who the fucking says stuff like that? But, the, but aw! I don't know where I'm going with this one. She's fuckin'... Oh, yeahyeahyeahokay. Oh, it's Danielle's friend. And she's like, "I've heard bad things about you. I've heard something about you." So I'm thinkin', okay, yeah, I'm a bad person, I did bad things in college, making out with random people, I'll admit it. But she's like, I've heard about you. So yeah, that's what I'm thinking that's what it about. So what did she say? Oh, you're not jewish. Holy FUCK, come on! But this is what happens when you're not in town to keep an eye on me. When my roommate is out of town, when you're not around, this kind of stuff happens I don't appreciate it, I can't keep an eye on myself, we've established this. It's aggravating, it's annoying, I don't know why, why all these jewish girls love me and they do this crap. I want to know why these frickin' jewish girls love me and I want answers! And dude, you know all the jewish girls* and I expect you to get to the bottom of this and fuckin' A man! Ah, well, I hope you're having fun having sex with a non-jewish guy in fuckin' Carolina what, and I'm making an asshole out of myself out here on the fucking street and causing trouble. Oh, at least you're entertained. That's what I can take away from this. I wish your friend still lived here**, I just want to go to bed right now, I don't know if I have enough money to take a cab home, unless I walk over to Avenue A and take a cab back from there. And fuckin' A man, fuckin' A. I'll talk to you later. It's so much funnier listening to the voicemail, the intonation makes it absolutely hysterical. I can only see him there, standing on some New York street corner early in the morning, yelling into the phone. But, if you're a single tall blonde between 21-35 and living in New York, and want to date one of the greatest guys in the world, please let me know so I can help poor Kevin out. He's already gone through all my tall blonde friends. Hell, I think that at this point he would settle for any height, any hair colour. Just be single, and promise that you won't even attempt mindgames with him, he's at a vulnerable point. Poor boy just needs  someone .   *I don't know where he figured that I "know all the jewish girls," since I'm not jewish. **Friend in question use to live in Union Square, and she was super-nice about letting drunk Kevin stay over late at night.  He, at the time of this call, was in the Village somewhere. And he lives on the Upper East Side. Hence the possibility that he didn't have enough money for a cab ride home, it's far.

      While I was at the  urlLink market  yesterday, I unfortunately couldn't find the  urlLink bottled water  that I usually drink. So, I had to find something else, and as I reached for the  urlLink other brand  that I drink, another one caught my eye.  urlLink Glac&eacute;au  smart water . Besides being in a nifty smooth slender bottle, it said it was "vapor distilled" and "electrolyte enhanced." A little blurb on the side of the bottle reads as following: side effects may include being called nerd, dork, geek, dweeb, brainiac, know-it-all, smarty-pants, smart-aleck, bookworm, egghead, four-eyes, einstein or being mistaken for the IT guy.   may induce sudden and inexplicable aversion to all less intelligent forms of water. apply liberally and frequently to dry people. I guess that they don't believe in capitalisation. No matter. On the other side of the bottle is a scale titled, "your brain on glac&eacute;au  smart water." From top to bottom, it goes capable, kinda arid, electrolytes flowing, clever enough, getting there (nice and moist), witty, 85% hydrated and at the very bottom, genius (mensa material).   It's hard to believe that some simple water is capable of such a thing. I don't really know how it works. The added electrolyes are calcium choloride, magnesium chloride and potassium bicarbonate. Naturally, I don't remember any of my chemistry (so maybe I do need this water?) so I don't know what benefits these elecrolytes can give me. I'd research it, but I'm too lazy right now. (Obviously, the water is not doing the trick.)  Oh, I'm stupid, I can check out their website to see what claims they make. This is what they say about their  smart water: after the air you breathe, water is the element we consume the most. thus, it is critical the water we drink is of the highest quality. first there was tap, then there was spring and now there is smart... biologically better water. our original product and the basis of all glacéau water products is glac&eacute;au smartwater. glac&eacute;au smartwater is vapor distilled with the nutrient enhancement of electrolytes. vapor distillation simulates the hydrologic cycle of mother nature -- water is evaporated, molecularly separated and then condensed. hydro = water and logic = smart... and hence, glac&eacute;au smartwater, the basis of all glac&eacute;au water products. Hm. I don't know if I even want to bother deciphering that. I do wish they would capitalise their letters though. I hate it when people only write in small letters. Oh, but here are what electrolytes do: electrolytes are substances that break up into ions (electrically charged particles) when they are dissolved in body fluids or water. some examples are sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. electrolytes are primarily responsible for the movement of nutrients into cells and the movement of wastes out of cells. So basically, this just means that the water is going to go in and out of my cells better. I don't know if I need accelerated water flow. How do you know? Whatever, it's water, and I'm a brat and I need my water to be filtered before I drink it. So drink this one I will, since it's already been bought.  I've had a bottle and a half over the past day. Do I feel any smarter? Hm, does the fact that I've now spent more time in the library of a  urlLink law school  I don't even attend than the library of where I spent the 4 years of my undergraduate life count? Wait, I'm here by force. Plus, the law library has all these magazines and there's nothing on TV right now.

      I love the woman who cuts my hair. (Yes, I fly down to the south to get my hair cut. But Marlo  understands  my hair better than anyone ever has.) She is funny and has a dry wit and is the nicest person ever. Anyway, we were talking about crankypants (yes, crankypants and I get our hair cut by the same lady), and she said: He came in here about a month ago, and when he said you were his girlfriend I was surprised! You're an attractive girl, and always well-dressed and put together.. and he's cute, but so... beachy. I don't know, I found this rather amusing. She made it sound as though being "beachy", whatever that may mean - probably vintage t-shirts and flipflops all the time - was a bad thing.   And on crankypants being techonogically inept - he has this really cool clock he got from The Sharper Image for Christmas, and but when yesterday I got in the display was blank. "What happened to your clock?" I asked. "Oh, the alarm kept going off and I couldn't figure out how to turn it off so I just removed the batteries." That's right, if something doesn't work, just pull the plug instead of trying to figure out how to fix it. Good thing he didn't go into medicine, that would have been a major problem.   I also have never seen so many people wearing their polo shirts with the collars turned up. Good thing I brought one down, so that I can wear it in the same fashion. I mean, I wouldn't want to be d&eacute;mod&eacute; (I don't even know if that's a word, I might have made it up, I seem to be doing that a lot lately). Who knew that Virginia was on the cutting edge of preppy style - oh, who am I kidding. The undergrad population at UVa is composed of all these little preppy brats.

      Procrastinating on packing, as always, I decided to play on the internet because obviously that way my bag will magically get packed. I am sick to death of cold weather and don't want to wear anything with sleeves again. However, this is not feasible. Anyway, I came across  urlLink this .  Now, why would you want to IMPLANT SOMETHING UNNECESSARY IN YOUR EYE. Maybe it's just me, but I hold the eyeballs nearly sacrosanct. I didn't wear contacts for the longest time, preferring to look like a big dork in high school with glasses, because I was afraid of sticking things in my eye. When I was time, My piano teacher at the time had to have surgery because his contact rolled so far back in his eye it got stuck. Or at least, that's what I was told. Now, I realise that it was probably cataract surgery, but this still doesn't freak me out about contacts any less. I still live in perpetual fear that my contact will get stuck to my eye, and that it will take many lasers to get it out. (Note: this nearly happened when I was in Rome. I have hard contacts, and I pulled my lid taut and blinked to pop it out, but it Didn't pop out. Rather, it moved to another part of my eye, and decided to stay suction-glued there. I - along with my roommate, the head RA and one of the professors - were up for 2 extra hours trying to get it out. It wouldn't budge. Fed up with this, the professor - this was a study-abroad program in high school - decided to just go in with his fingers and fish it out. You have no idea how scared I was. I now have this little plunger-like device in case this ever happens again.)  Needless to say, with this phobia regarding things stuck in my eye - I just don't understand why you'd want to have a little heart implanted under your cornea. Are there absolutely no other parts of the body left to deface?   Plus, how did someone come up with this idea? I can just imagine it.  Late - and obviously drunk - one night, Jack - oh wait, this was in the Netherlands, hm, I don't know any Dutch names - Gunther glanced over at Bertha in the dim candlelight. The bar was one of those dark speakeasy-type affairs and there was a saxophonist, warming up for a later performance, practicing his scales in the corner. The air was hazy with cigarette smoke, which just added to the easy feeling of slight drunkenness after a full night of laughing and drinking with friends. But now, it was just Gunther and Bertha, everyone else having made their way home ages ago.  For the longest time, Gunther had had the biggest crush on Bertha. She was new to the area, having seemingly come from nowhere just a couple of months ago. He wasn't quite sure how she knew everyone, but somehow she did. For the longest time, he had been scared to even utter a word to her, afraid that he would say something absolutely pathetic and she would just laugh in his face. He had only barely been able to stammer out a perfunctory greeting earlier this night, just awed by her exotic beauty. But now, it was just the two of them, and she was leaned back in her seat, looking over his shoulder with a bored expression on her face, and he knew it was up to him.  But what to say? As always in her presence, he was tongue-tied. And in the candlelight, her beauty just broke his heart. The light flickered over her face, and in a moment of near-genius, he gasped, "When the light dances like that, it looks like there's a heart in your eye."  Yes, this sounded as stupid as it reads. Bertha snorted, bored with his adolescent adoration, and stood up and strolled over to the saxophonist. Utterly devastated, Gunther shrugged on his coat and left the bar, mentally berating himself for not coming up with something cooler to say.  Years later, Gunther never forgot what he came to call "the lamest line in the world." He never saw her along again, and several months later had to leave for university, and that was it. But he still never forgot how really, it  had  looked like there was a heart in her eye, for just a split second. As by this time he had become a relatively successful opthamologist, he always wondered if it would be possible to... really make it look like someone had a heart in her eye. And after years of experimenting - this had become his lifelong goal, still obsessed with his one-time love - he figured out a way to make it happen.  Little did Bertha, who after years of smoking and drinking became a wrinkled old hag, know that this latest trend in eye jewelry was inspired by her.  A wretchedly bad story for a wretchedly bad idea. It's only fair.

      So, when we were in Puerto Rico, one night we ate at  urlLink this restaurant , which bills itself as serving aphrodiasiacal food, like conch and prawns and oysters. But that's not the important part of the story. (The food, incidentally, was very good.) At some point, I was bored - we were probably waiting for our check - so I took that opportunity to play with crankypants's  urlLink cell phone . Now his cell, unlike mine, is all sorts of fun. It has this little alien called mi amigo that does fun things on the screen, like take a bath and do pushups, and all sorts of other neat features that my piece of crap phone doesn't have.  Now, the courtyard we were sitting in was awash with the sound of  urlLink treefrogs . They go  urlLink "coqui! coqui!"  and it's really quite amusing. As I was watching mi amigo dance across the screen, I wondered if I could perhaps change his ringer so that instead of playing "When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again" (which I had changed it to), it could play the sound of treefrogs. That would be so cool, I thought. So I scrolled through his options. Unfortunately, there wasn't one where you could record a ring. Apparently you have to download them from somewhere. Darn. There was, however, some option called "auto answer" where you could record sounds. I wasn't really quite sure what this did - probably answered the phone for you? -  but whatever, more importantly, it let me record! So record I did. 20 seconds of "coqui! coqui!"   I meant to call his phone to see what would happen, but I forgot. Seriously, I forgot. That's what happens when I get distracted. So I forgot that I had futzed with his phone. This is important.  After our lovely vacation, when we were back in our respective states, I got a phone call from crankypants. An irate phone call. Apparently, what "auto answer" does is if the person doesn't pick up the phone within a certain amount of time, the caller automatically receives the recorded message, and then the phone hangs up on them. I personally think this is stupid - shouldn't the caller get to go into voicemail? But hey, I didn't design the phone. So crankypants had been getting lots of calls from some very confused people who said that they had called his phone, and that they had heard "coqui! coqui!" and then that the phone hung up on them. One person even thought that crankypants himself was making the random sounds.   Personally, I think this is hysterical. Can you imagine calling someone, getting random nature sounds, and then being hung up on? Heehee. He was mad, however, because he didn't know what I had done to his phone and neither did the people at Sprint. Stupid Sprint people. Shouldn't they know how to use their phones? Also, shouldn't crankypants know how to use his own phone? Please, it took me five seconds to figure out how to change his ring - which he still doesn't know how to do, hence "When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again." It's great when I forget he's in class and he forgets to turn his phone off and the thing plays an electronica version of the song. So he called me, and if I had been there, I'm sure he would have throttled me. Luckily, I'm smart and know how to use technology, and with some help, told him how to get rid of this "auto answer" function.   Every time I think of this, I laugh. Plus, he doesn't know that I saved the treefrog sound in another undisclosed location on his phone (under "Voice Memo," in case you're wondering), just in case. He doesn't think it's so funny, though. Someone needs a sense of humour! I don't think he's ever going to trust his phone to me again. Which is sad, because I enjoy watching mi amigo and his antics. It's not alien porn, whatever crankypants may say.

      I love to talk about my friend Brooke's wedding. Primarily because it is so... well, 1950s suburban WASP that it blows the mind. I mean, we went to an all-girl's school for a reason. To get such notions kicked out of us. Okay, not really. I have my wedding planned down to nearly the last detail already - but believe me, it's going to involve drunk barefoot people in formal garb on the beach. None of this overly proper and starched stuff.  Anyway, why I bring this up is because last week, Brooke was home to further organise wedding details. Must be a bitch living across the country from where your wedding is going to be, because then it leaves all the detailwork in the hands of your entirely capable yet incredibly manipulative mother. Oh well. This isn't my wedding, after all. And of course, when Brooke got back to Boston, she just  had  to share the incredibly fun details of her week at home. This included: the first of several bridal showers, choosing what the groom and male attendants get to wear, food tasting and best (or worst) of all, shopping for "lots of honeymoon lingerie" with her mother.   Oh. My. God. Like really. It's not like her fianc&eacute; hasn't seen it all already - they are living together, after all. First of all, I can envision buying maybe one new nightie or similar item. There is no need to buy multiple outfits, you're just going to be naked anyway, why bother with the hassle? And plus - shopping for these items with your mother? Maybe it's because I'm not that close to mine, but that is perhaps the penultimate thing I'd want to shop for with her. (I don't know what the worst item would be, I'm still trying to figure that out.) Do you think she actually  tried things on so that her mother could critique ? While this is definiitely cringe-worthy, it wouldn't be too surprising either. I wouldn't be surprised if somehow Brooke's mother just "happened" to be in Maui when Brooke and Mark were there on their honeymoon. I'm sure if she could figure out a way, she would be lighting the bedside candles and scattering rose petals around the room for the consummation.   Ergh. Before I get into any further imaginings that will leave me wanting to rend holes in my mind, I decided it would be fun to start a new feature. That is, what if Brooke wrote about her wedding? What fun would it be? The answer is: you would hear more about wedding registries and colours of blue than you ever wanted to hear in your life. So, I decided, that I would start writing, spordically, as if I were Brooke and getting married in August at the tender age of 24 to the first person I've ever had sex with. (Not that I'm scorning this - but it's so terribly unrealistic nowadays. Yet she managed to make it happen.) And with that, I present the first installment of  Brooke's Wedding Countdown . Dear Diary,  I can't believe it, in 130 days I will be Mrs. Mark XXX!!!!! :) I have been waiting for this for six years now, so it's about damn time!!! I cannot wait to use our new stationery. It is so cute. :) It says "Mr. and Mrs. Mark XXX" at the top in this navy blue font. Mom said that it was super-classy and reminded her of her first wedding stationery she got with Dad.   Today, Mom and I went food tasting. I know, Mark wasn't there, but really, his opinion doesn't really matter in this situation. After all, my mother is married and so obviously knows more than he does. Mom and I tasted 5 different salmon dishes, and 6 chicken. To me, they all taste alike, but what do I know? Mom says that there are subtle but important distinctions between each dish, and it could make or break the wedding if we choose the wrong one. So we chose salmon dish #3 (it has lemon slices on it!! How cute!! They remind me of the sun!!) and chicken dish #1 (I really liked chicken dish #5, but Mom said that it wouldn't do at all, the garnishing would have clashed horribly with the blue ribbon on the menus, and we definitely do not want that.)   After we chose the menu, Mom and I went shopping for my honeymoon lingerie!!! I hope she doesn't know that Mark and I are sleeping together. I mean, we have been living together for the past eighteen months, but I tell her that he sleeps on the couch every night. Because he is obviously a gentleman. But between you and me, he is *not a gentleman between the sheets. Teehee :) So we went to find several honeymoon outfits. Mom tells me that I have to have at least 5 different nighties. She even offered to look in the attic for the one she wore on the first night of her honeymoon. I hope she finds it. Wouldn't that be a great tradition, to pass on the first-night gown?? :) I could then pass it down to my daughter! That would be so cool!!   So I tried on several different nighties for her, and we only found 3 acceptable ones :( But there is plenty of time to find 2 more! Mom also said that it is very important that I light at least 10 candles around the bed, and that I make sure to scatter rose petals everywhere, since she won't be there to do it for me. I just wanted to say Mom, I'm a big girl - but I didn't want her to guess that Mark and I have already done it. Plus, I have to keep with proper tradition. After all, Mom, Grandmother, and Great-Grandmother all had 10 lit tapers at the bedside the first night of their honeymoon. Mom also tried to give me some tips about what to expect. She said it might hurt at first, but if I lay back and thought of England, and remembered that this was for the greater good, it would be okay. I didn't want to say that I really thought of James van der Beek, because remember, it's all hush hush that Mark and I actually sleep in the same bed. Teehee :) :)  Okay. I need to find my yellow twinset because tonight Mark and I are going out to dinner with one of the partners at the law firm he's working at this summer!!! I cannot wait to talk to the partner's wife and find out what she does to keep her man happy!! This is invaluable information!! I like to get as many tips as possible - obviously, Mom's are the best and most important, but it's always good to have a wide base of knowledge :)  love, Brookie :) :) Note: I love Brooke. I've known her since we were 9. But it's So Easy to make fun of the entire situation. And obviously, the above is a parody. Yes, perhaps based a bit in reality, but wildly exaggerated - except for the use of happy faces. She uses them like punctuation. It makes me want to remove the smiley face function from her IM.

      The other day,  urlLink Scarlett Ace  suggested that I write reviews of books I've read, just because I've read so many. I love reading.  I'm that sort of person who will forego sleep in order to finish a particularly compelling book. But I decided to instead make my first review of a movie, partially because I don't feel like writing about the latest book I read ( Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl , if you're interested), and also have  lots  to say about the latest movie I saw. Plus, this way I'm not continually writing about little white dogs, or about how I live to annoy crankypants. (I haven't yet shared the treefrog story, it is the best ever. Some day, when I'm out of things to write. Like tomorrow.)  As deduced from the title of this post, I saw  urlLink  The Prince and Me  , starring Julia Stiles and one very hot Brit, Luke Mably. (Incidentally, he is my new love. It definitely helped that he was royalty in the movie. But even so, sooo cute. And he's older than me, which is nice because then I don't feel like I'm robbing the cradle. But enough of this. Let me get back to movie-reviewing.) Note: If you don't want to find out what happens, don't read on. I've already warned you.   The premise is very simple. Studious Girl meets Playboy Prince in Diguise. After some initial resistance on her part, they fall in love. Then she finds out he's really a prince, gets mad, but follows him anyway to Denmark. She realises that she can't be Queen of Denmark, returns home. He shows up and wins her back.  To elaborate: Girl is way into studying and wants to be a doctor and work for Doctors without Borders. She has never left Wisconsin, but has big dreams for the future. Prince, enticed by seeing an ad for  Girls Gone Wild  - the Wisconsin edition, decides that he wants to go to the midwest. He is followed by his ever faithful manservant. The manservant is great and hysterical throughout the movie. Prince meets Girl in bar, attempts to convince her to show him her boobs. Not an auspicious start - but oh, don't you already know that it's going to be true love?   Of course they fall in love. While at her family's dairy farm over Thanksgiving, there is a hysterical scene involving racing lawnmowers. Crankypants assures me that such ridiculous things do happen in rural Wisconsin. People race lawnmowers! I so want to see this when I'm out there. There is also the requisite shot of someone wearing a cheesehead hat. Then the tabloids catch up to the hot prince, and he's called home to Denmark where he's to assume responsibility for the throne as his father is sick. Initially mad at his deception, Girl realises that she does love the Prince, and hightails it to Copenhagen. Blahblahblah, I'm tired of recapping the film, this isn't fun. Suffice it to say that he proposes, she accepts but later realises that she really does want to be a doctor. (Why? It's so overrated.) She returns home and at her graduation a year later, he shows up, saying that he loves her and only her and will let her pursue her dreams and he will wait as long as it takes, because he loves her  that  much. TadaaalotsofkissingTheEnd!   But before you write this off as another stupid teen movie - which it is, I agree - it does have some redeeming qualities, that makes it perfect for females of any age. (Guys, you're out of luck, unless you think Julia Stiles is hot.) Let's go over the romantic moments in the movie, that make you melt inside, coo, and wish that men were like this in real life.  To apologise for his boorish behaviour at the bar (where he attempts to get her to show her boobs), Prince quotes from  Romeo and Juliet . Shakespeare. He uses Shakespeare to say "I'm sorry." I'm lucky if crankypants even realises that I'm miffed at him. But the prince - Shakespeare - definitely 5 "aws" on the "Aw that's so cute and sweet" scale.    He gets a job at the bar she works at in order to make money. Late one night, they're closing up and she plays a song on the jukebox, and dances barefoot around the empty tables. This made me wince because ew, there are like all sorts of germs on a dirty barfloor, but this is a movie. The prince just stands there, watching her, madly in love. At least like 3 "aws".   While they're studying at the library, he plays with her fingers. This may seem insignificant and silly, but believe me, it's big. It's the little things that matters. I wish guys would realise this. Definitely 2 "aws".   When she flies to Denmark to pursue him, she sees him in a royal procession. That's right, he's all done up in royal riding wear with lots of medallions and gold cording and a silly hat, and he's on a horse. When he sees her, there's this gigantic smile on his face, and he breaks form, gallops around and swings her upon his horse. I agree, this cannot be accomplished by the common person. Which makes it even better. It gets at least like 40 "aws".    Later that same day, and still in his royal riding wear, he proposes to her. And boy, does he propose. Down on one knee, he tells her how much he loves her, and then opens his hand - and there's a butterfly, atop this gigantic diamond ring, and the butterfly flitters away. It was poetic. It was beautiful. It melted me into a puddle of mush from which I will never recover. There is no way to rank this scene. The butterfly. See, it's in the little things.    At his coronation ball, he asks her to dance, saying that they're playing their song. Surprised, she asks if they even have a song - then realises that the orchestra is playing that same song that played on the jukebox when he once watched her so longingly. This gets 20 "aws".   At the same ball, he pulls her into a dark room and says he has a surprise for her. No, not  that  kind of surprise, get your mind out of the gutter. In the corner, there is a covered table, and with a tada takes the tablecloth off to reveal a - dumdadum - meat slicer! Okay, not obviously cute. But see, earlier in the movie, the first time they connect is when she shows him how to use the meat slicer at the bar where he's just started working. So see now, it's cute. Meaningful only to the two of them. And he makes her a turkey sandwich. This receives 20 "aws" too, it's hard to say if this is cuter or if the "this is our song" scene is.  There are a few other cute scenes, but I'm not going to reveal them because you really should watch the movie yourself. If only men would realise how easy it is to make a girl completely fall in love with them. Really, there should be some sort of course that men can be forcibly enrolled in, with courses entitled "How to woo a girl without losing your masculinity" and "The proper proposal" and "It's all in the little things: How to keep a girl in love with you." Movies such as this one would obviously be required viewing.

      I think that all standardized tests, rather than having 1 correct answer and 4 wrong ones, should instead modify their grading system so that it resembles those relationship quizzes in  Cosmo . That is, full points should be awarded if you do get the right answer, but then if you choose an answer that's close but not correct, you should get correspondingly fewer points - but you get points! - so that the more "wrong" but yet still "could be correct" an answer is, you get fewer and fewer points. Obviously, there still will be a blatantly wrong answer, and you get no points for it. Here is an example:  What city is the capital of France?  (a) Rome (b) Paris (c) London (d) Cairo (e) Nice  If you choose (a) Rome, you get 5 points because while it is obviously the wrong answer, it is part of continental Europe, but it is not in France. So, wrong country, but vague geographic nearness. Plus, Italian is awfully similar (especially gramatically) to French, so points for recognising that! If you choose (b) Paris, you get the full 10 points because you are right!! If you choose (c) London, you get 2 points because while London is the capital of a European country, it is the capital of England, and everyone knows the English don't like the French, much less the rest of Europe. If they did, they would adopt the Euro, but no, they think they're better than everyone else. If you choose (d) Cairo, you get 0 points because Cairo isn't even in Europe. And finally, if you choose (e) Nice, you get 7 points because yes, Nice is in France but is unfortunately not the capital.   See, this way you're not overly penalised if you sort of know something but don't really know it, as is the case all too often when I'm taking a multiple choice test. I would do  so much better  on standardized tests then, and wouldn't feel like I'd have to study so much before the test, which would make me a happier person, and if I'm happy then everyone is happy.   But enough about tests! Time for a post-psych GRE pedicure! Woohoo!

      At my job, there are two women named Heather. By some freak coincidence, they are both brunette, life-long Rhode Island residents, in their mid-30s, overweight, and visually impaired. (Note to self: do not name your daughter Heather.) With all these similarities - you have to admit there are quite a few - it is amazing how much attitude can make a difference.  Nice Heather is - well, nice. I love working with her, because she is so much fun to talk to. She does not let her visual impairment hinder her life at all - she has lots of friends, dates occassionally, has the cutest  urlLink dog , organises group trips to New York all the time, etcetc. She's taken the hand that life dealt her and played it well. As a matter of fact, I didn't even know that there was something wrong with her vision until a co-worker pulled me aside and told me, and later on Nice Heather told me herself, to make sure I knew just in case I thought she was looking at me funny (she doesn't quite focus on you, but behind you, which is unnerving at first but you get used to it.) She is very matter-of-fact about the fact that she can't see, and that she has some excess weight on her. She laughs it off, saying, "It's my fault for having so many chefs as friends" - but it's important to note that she's not cloyingly self-deprecating, as sometimes happens in this situation. When we talk, time flies quickly. She is just so enjoyable to be around, her personality so sparkling, that you forget her physical handicaps.   The other Heather - well, I think of her as Bitter Heather. Perhaps unfair... but accurate. She looks at life through bitter-tinted lenses (what colour would they be? Perhaps a dingy brown), and you have to tiptoe around her. I'm scared to even open my mouth in her presence, for fear of saying something un-PC and hurting her feelings, as I'm not really known for censoring all my thoughts. She is ultra-sensitive about her weight and her vision problems, and very jealous of other people over everything. It's like she feels she has been unjustly wronged, and is mad at everyone else over it. It doesn't help that sometimes she takes a supercilious tone when I come in to help with the mailings, talking to me like I'm 5 and have never stuffed envelopes before. Every week, I hope that she's not scheduled for when I'm around. And I thought that maybe it was just me, that I was overly sensitive and biased against fat people, but Nice Heather told me that within a month of her starting work, Bitter Heather managed to antagonise everyone on staff, and that even she doesn't like to talk to Bitter Heather because it's sometimes so trying. As a result, she has absolutely no friends at work (although everyone tries to be nice to her), nor outside of work. It's very sad, really, but she brought it upon herself in part.   I know there is a moral to this story, but I hate proselyting, and am woefully bad at it, so I won't. On a completely different note, am I a big dork for absolutely enjoying form-filling? I get a blank form to fill out, and it's actually fun for me. Today I got my grad school health forms, and by golly if I didn't take a pen to them right away. I'm sure this says something about my personality, but I don't know what.

      Now, I'm all for working and whatnot, but I've determined that I don't have the discipline to have a real office job. 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year? That is definitely not for me. (I am very French  comme &ccedil;a , they have a lovely 35 hour workweek they're trying to cut down to 30.) I need the flexibility of up and taking random days off if I feel the urge. And I definitely need a winter vacation, spring break and summer vacation. My last jobs have all given me this option, thereby spoiling me for any steady position I might want to hold down in the future.  Hence why being a professor would be perfect for me - after the first several years of toiling away, you get tenure and then, if you're like crankypants's parents, teach one seminar a week and spend the rest of your time travelling for "conferences." Based on his parents' travels, these mythical conferences are just excuses to get out of the midwest on the university's dollar. They instead look at beachfront properties in California. Or if you're my friend's Emily's mother, you don't even bother seeking tenure because your husband is so rich you can have 5 properties scattered throughout the US and Europe and you can wear Jil Sander suits to work. This is not a shabby life at all. And as a professor, you get all those school holidays. I'd never have to give up my summers again.   But then, I thought, why expend this much effort? Why actually  work ? And then I remembered my long-standing dream of being a muse. That's right. Like Sharon Stone's character in, well,  urlLink  The Muse  . All she did was inspire people. She didn't even have to come up with ideas of her own. Rather, she just sat around, sponged off people, smiled every once in awhile - and got  urlLink great   urlLink gifts   urlLink in   urlLink return . Definitely not shabby, if you ask me.   What re-spurred this interest was reading what is currently my favourite book - maybe even my personal bible, at least for the meantime -  urlLink  Bergdorf Blondes  **. This book is full of all sorts of fabulous quotes, such as " 'Honey, when you're drinking martinis and your martini glass is full of tears, you gotta ask yourself, is the Universe trying to tell me something?' " and "When it comes to sexual politics, my view is that the liberated modern girl is better off acting like a virgin so that she can do all sorts of pornographic things with no fear of getting a reputation," and "The heavenly thing about anti-anxiety pills like Xanax is that you can be at the epicenter of your own personal romantic tragedy and you don't even notice." I could go on forever. There is also an absolutely fabulous quote about champagne bubbles, but I can't find it right now.   Anyway, back to my point. Because it is a brilliant book,  Bergdorf Blondes  also mentions muses. For example: However, there is one career here to which they [Manhattan society girls] are positively addicted - if you could call it a career, that is - because it's the kind of career that doesn't involve much actual working, or ordering staples, or being handcuffed to a PC all day, or anything grim like that. The most coveted job here is to work as a "muse" to a fashion designer. The "chores" consist mainly of sitting home all day waiting for clothes to arrive by messenger and being photographed at glittering parties every night. Now, if that doesn't sound like a perfect job for me, I don't know what does.   My friend Nick***, who currently plays soccer in Hungary, said that if he became a writer I could be his muse, for senior year in college he based some creative writing pieces on me. See? I have training already. He needs to stop fooling around in Europe, get home and start writing. I promise you, I am real good at sitting around and doing nothing but inspiring people. I am indeed  that  fabulous.  I feel like I could get started on this career path straightaway.     Notes :  *Sorry for the pathetic attempt at a pun above. Obviously, I need my own muse to be inspired. Do you get it though? Please say you do.   **I am not a blonde, despite how airheaded these posts are. Just needed to make that clear. Although I did find a blonde hair once. Not grey. Blonde. That scared me.   ***This is obviously not the Nick described below. This Nick - really, I think of him as Nicky to keep things straight - and I get along smashingly, because he is not desperately in love with me (just occassionally in lust), and because we used to go shopping on my lunch breaks in Paris. He also has been accused of being gay, but no, he's really just a metrosexual. Although even I question it sometimes.

      I can't seem to figure out how to set my laptop up outside so that I can play online while enjoying the lovely sunshine. Can't see this blasted monitor. If I face the sun, I have to squint (bad! premature wrinkling!), but I can't see the screen if my back is to the sun. Plus, I don't feel like I'm getting as tan. And I'm scared of my laptop overheating and blowing up.  This is highly problematic. What's the point of having a wireless connection and a laptop if you can't sit outside?  And there is nothing quite like flying into LA. With most airports on the East Coast, the airport is located outside the city. So it's a rather nice descent into green pastures and whatnot. Flying into LA - well, that's a whole different story. First, the LA metropolis spreads for  miles , so you fly over a helluva lot of city before you even approach the airport. Then there's this thick layer of smog through which you have to descend - ah, wonderful home. It's great to be back.

      Rah! After I fly home today (first class,  bien s&ucirc;r  - what's the good of having all these frequent flier miles accumulated from visiting crankypants if I don't use them to my benefit?), I'm not gonna have to fly  anywhere  for the next three months (aside from trips to San Francisco and  urlLink Vegas  - but they're less than an hour away, they don't really count).   You have no idea how excited I am to not have to see the interior of an airport for such a long span of time. While having preferred status on airlines is certainly a nice perk, flying just gets  tiring  after awhile. I don't know how people fly for business. There is just so much stress, and I swear my skin starts to break out as soon as I think of upcoming flights.   Because I am lacking in all creativity, I leave you with bits of an IM transcript between me and  urlLink Scarlett Ace  regarding Brooke. Ah, to be so boring. I can't even fathom.    me :  oh she's going to vegas in june with mark  me :  i cannot see her in vegas  ScarlettAce :  me neither...i can see her saying, "oh heavens to betsey, those showgirls are nearly naked"  me :  she's gonna go to vegas and not gamble  me :  now, i'm generally against gambling  me :  but if you're going to vegas  me :  might as well do some of it  me :  haha i'm asking her if she's gonna go to strip clubs with him  ScarlettAce :  haha, what is she saying?  me :  "haha yeah right"  me :    Brooke :  i don't think i can gamble   :) probably for the best   :)  me :  eh, but no point in going there if there isn't some gambling done  Brooke :   i dunno, i just want to be able to see mark  me :   and go with him to strip clubs?  Brooke :   haha, yeah right  me :   it could be fun if you go together  me :   at least it's a story  Brooke :   hahah. i don't think mark would go for that in a million years  me :   really?  me :  WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM?  me :   IS HE MISSING BOTH HIS BALLS?  me :  fook, I'd go to strip clubs in vegas, why not?  ScarlettAce :  omg, the smiley faces, they're killing me!  ScarlettAce :  and she doesn't gamble??  me :  what's WRONG with her?  me :  are they going to spend the whole weekend holding hands?   ScarlettAce :  omg, omg, omg, omg  ScarlettAce :  she's going to vegas, and 1)isn't going to gamble   ScarlettAce :  2)isn't going to strip clubs?  ScarlettAce :  and mark is a freakin eunuch if a strip club wouldn't tantalize him  ScarlettAce :  "i just want to see mark"  ScarlettAce :  priceless  me :  I can't believe mark wouldn't want to go to a stripclub  ScarlettAce :  dr. laura would love these people  ScarlettAce :  they're diabetic apple pie  me :  i'm so confused  ScarlettAce :  me too  me :  what guy doesn't want to go to a stripclub?  ScarlettAce :  i know, right?  me :  seriously  me :  HE'S A FREAK!!!  me :  READ THIS    ScarlettAce :  brooke's mom chopped off his dick  ScarlettAce :  i'm convinced of it  me :    Brooke :  yeah, it would make him very uncomfortable and he would feel really weird about it  me :  Seriously?  me :  Is it the live aspect or the random naked girls aspect?  me :  Or the public side?  Brooke :  yeah, seriously. he's just that way. he doesn't want to see random naked girls alone, or with me. mark said he has no desire to ever go to a strip club, with or without me. he feels very strongly that he shouldn't see other naked girls beside me--i'm serious  me :  Wait, let me highlight that  me :   he doesn't want to see random naked girls alone, or with me. mark said he has no desire to ever go to a strip club, with or without me. he feels very strongly that he shouldn't see other naked girls beside me--i'm serious   ScarlettAce :  i swear, he's lying or gay!  me :  I am SO confused  ScarlettAce :  or he must be bizarely asexual and lousy in bed  me :  i mean, i bet brooke was the first girl he saw nekkid  ScarlettAce :  i bet he only has sex with the lights off, in missionary  ScarlettAce :  i know, that just means you're more boring than dry white bread  me :    me :  does this mean no porn too?  Brooke :  haha--he used to, but stopped once we got engaged. he really cracks me up. i asked him why and told him i honestly didn't mind at all, but he says he just dones't feel right about it. i don't know  :)  me :  What's wrong with him?  ScarlettAce :  STOP THE FUCKING SMILEY FACES  me :  seriously  me :  What's WRONG WITH HIM  me :  maybe he's afraid that if he jerks off to porn, he won't be able to recover by the time he has to sleep with her  me :  what do i say?  me :  i can't ask her if she's worried about his sex drive  ScarlettAce :  ask her!  me :  i can't  me :  i just can't  ScarlettAce :  do it!  ScarlettAce :  its outta concern for her  ScarlettAce :  really  ScarlettAce :  lol  me :  hahaha  me :  i am bewildered  me :  no porn  me :  i bet no sex toys  ScarlettAce :  ask!  ScarlettAce :  lol  ScarlettAce :  dude  ScarlettAce :  i don't understand  me :    me :  I wonder why he's like this  me :  I mean, honestly, sainthood  Brooke :  i don't know...mark feels very strongly about having certain morals and i guess this relates to that. i guess he doesn't feel it's right to look at women other than his wife.   me :  honestly  me :  he's so going to explode  ScarlettAce :  okay, its fine to look at other women  ScarlettAce :  to touch them, no  ScarlettAce :  to approach them, no  ScarlettAce :  but to admire?  ScarlettAce :  totally normal!  me :    me :  aww  me :  that's sweet  Brooke :  yeah   :)  Brooke :  he's a special one  me :  I agree. SPECIAL.  ScarlettAce :  "special"  ScarlettAce :  as in special ed  me :  sooo confused  me :  i don't even know what to say to her anymore!  ScarlettAce :  i know, its hard to relate to that kind of situation  ScarlettAce :  cause its just not normal!  ScarlettAce :  i can't believe she lives in this bubble  ScarlettAce :  brooke have anything else truly bizarre to share?  me :  i can't talk to her anymore  me :  this was enough for my fragile system for the day

      I should be packing. I really should.  Instead, I find myself playing this game over and over.  urlLink Fake or not?  As I am returning home very shortly to the land of plastic surgery, this is rather apt. In case you're a slacker like me, but actually have a real job, this link is not work-safe, as it consists of figuring out if the pictured breasts are fake or not. There are lots of bad boob jobs out there. It's quite a travesty, really. If you're going to spend that much money to augment your breasts, can't you at least make sure that they're done well?  Anyway, this quiz is great fun. Too bad it isn't helping me pack and otherwise organise my life.

      And so, I have returned, safe and sound from the black hole (read: the midwest). Obviously, instead of packing, I have decided to write about the trip because I am doing what I am best at - procrastinating.   All in all, it was (surprise!) a very pleasant trip. Here are the highlights:  Being fed lots of home-cooked meals. It's been awhile since I've been home, so this was nice (as I'm generally too lazy and will eat out instead of making my own food). What was even funnier is that his mother - ah, but she has Texan blood running through her veins - has put crankypants's father and sister on the South Beach diet (even though neither of them really need it), whereas crankypants himself is on a weight-gain diet, because he is way too skinny. Yes, she made him weigh himself at the end of his week home, and was positively gleeful over the fact that he had gained 5 pounds. I personally don't think I could follow the South Beach diet, as no meal is complete without a healthy serving of carbs. Also, the dog is on a diet because it is 2 pounds over its goal weight. It's rather amusing.   Having their stupid little pug fall madly in love with me. I'm talking slavish adoration. I say stupid because cranky kept telling her that I'd trade her in for a maltese in a heartbeat (which is true), but the little dog would follow me faithfully around the house, guarding my chair or sitting on my lap whenever she got a chance. I think he's just jealous that it took to me so quickly. And I didn't even have to feed it to get this kind of devotion! His parents marveled at this, because apparently the dog love(d) the mother the best. No longer! When cranky left yesterday morning, the dog couldn't have cared less, but kept an eye on me in case I suddenly disappeared.  Hm, those really are the highlights. It was a rather tame and very bucolic weekend, filled with tons of family time. We walked the dog (while I kept an eagle eye out for the new maltese on the block, which unfortunately I didn't see), I helped his mother with her grant proposal, we looked at the new condos the parents keep threatening to buy (as they no longer have kids in the house, this is their new hobby). I saw the university and the "important" parts of the city, we watched videos, went out for drinks, so on and so forth. I mean, there were tons of funny moments, but they're not so funny if you don't know him and his family.  Also, it is a very good thing that I do not use real names, because his mother proclaimed at dinner one night that she loves googling everyone. She has limited computer skills, but this is apparently one of them. Hopefully she's not found too much on me.   Unfortunately, I did not get to see lawnmower races. This is very disappointing, but I've been told that perhaps we could find one the next time I visit - which is whenever mosquito season  isn't , as I swear, nearly my entire leg swelled up in an allergic reaction to one measly bite. It's really sad, but I figure that this is my body telling me that I should be home in LA, where there aren't any mosquitos.   And in case you were wondering - yes, I slept in crankypants's bedroom. With him. His parents apparently had no problem with this, which was just fine by me.

      Conversation held with my mother on Friday:  Mom: "If you don't email me your itinerary, you're going to be stranded at the airport." Me: "I'm getting in Thursday at like 8, I told you." Mom: "No, you told me Wednesday." Me: "Wednesday? Why would I fly in Wednesday? I always fly in Thursdays." Mom: "I distinctly remember you telling me Wednesday." [pause, while I check my day planner.] Me: "Oops." Mom: "What's happened to you, you usually always remember this stuff."  That's right. That means 24 HOURS LESS to pack up my apartment. If I had a PA, he could also schedule movers for me, and it'd all be on the company, since obviously this mythical corporation would be paying for my moving costs, and the PA.   And my PA could also meet with the other PA of my life, that is, the physican's assistant who treated (or pretended to treat) my  urlLink plague . Apparently the Chief of the ER and the attending received my letter (I do not pull any punches), and would like to meet with me and evil bitch troll lady. BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR ALL OF THIS. I have - one second, let me count, about 70 hours left to pack (ie throw everything away), finish up stuff at work, meet with troll lady and.. there are about a zillion other things to do.  It was positively lovely going to Madison for the weekend - but I really should have used those 4 days to wrap up my affairs here. I'm stressing out just thinking of it.

      And well, it's another early weekend for me! (I know, you're asking, does this girl work? The answer is: not very much right now. It's absolutely lovely.)   Now, I just know that you're asking yourself, where is this lovely little jetsetter running off to this time? Goshdarnit, I wish that I could reply with  urlLink Paris  or  urlLink Tuscany  or  urlLink St. Barths  and the like, but the sad truth is this: This time, I am flying to  urlLink Madison, Wisconsin .  That's right.  urlLink Wisconsin . Solidly midwestern. In the middle of the country, the part of the US I like to call the "flyover states." Or better yet, "the black hole."  Why is she going there, you ask? Is she off her meds? Has her  urlLink antibiotics-plus-alcohol combination not been so hot after all ? Has she been replaced with a crazy person?  No, perhaps and she already is crazy. Crankypants is from there, despite his very southern California look, and this is one of the few times that he's home every year, and like hell I'm flying out there in the dead of winter. I hear it gets  really  cold there.   But I'm trying to be optimistic, even though I get unaccountably nervous anytime I travel to a land-locked state. It's like being stuck smack in the centre of an auditorium - if disaster strikes, you're stuck in the middle and  can't get out . Anyway, here is what I'm looking forward to:  Having a three-martini lunch when I get in. As sad as this may seem, this has been one of my goals for the last several years, but you have no idea how hard it is to find people who actually want to start drinking at noon. During anatomy lunch breaks last year, my lab partner and I would attempt 3-martini lunches, but after 2 we realised that if we had a 3rd we would be in no shape to wield a scalpel. Hell, after 2 we were already really obnoxious when we returned to lab. Anyway, I leave at the awfully early hour of 9AM here, and will get in 1PM Central Time. Crankypants knows me well, and will immediately feed me, because I am wretchedly cranky (maybe I can be crankyskirt. Crankydress?) after travelling and also if I haven't eaten every two hours. He has made the mistake of not feeding me in both instances, and it's not pretty. He has since wisened up and told me that when I got in we could go straight to a nice extravagant lunch. Sadly, one of the quicker ways to this girl's heart is by promises of food and drink. (A Maltese, jewelry and clothes are still the quickest.)   Visiting the real store behind this  urlLink marvelous shopping website . I really want  urlLink this skirt  and  urlLink these pants , but I like trying on my clothes before I buy them. And now I can!    Watching lawnmower races. I never knew such a thing existed until I watched  urlLink  The Prince and Me  . You have no idea how excited I am to see this. Crankypants says that this doesn't really happen in Madison, but I'm willing to travel out to farm country to witness this. I can't think of anything else right now. But here is I know what's definitely in store:  Having to meet his pug, Kobe. And I'm going to have to be nice about it too, because apparently the whole family dotes on this little stupid tail-chasing chocolate-gorging barrel of a dog. I'm sorry, but pugs are so not cute. And they shed, even though it looks like they don't have hair. Ergh. And crankypants says that I'm just going to  love  taking it on walks. However, I have just been informed that there is a maltese that lives several houses down! Maybe these walks won't be too bad. Maybe I can trade in the pug for the maltese. Just for the weekend.    Being dragged from vintage store to vintage store. Because apparently the best ones are in Madison. Who knew that it was such a stylin' place? I am markedly not excited about this, because I Hate Vintage Stores (unless they're arranged nicely, of course.)   Going to a dinner party held at the house of his mother's college roommate. Gah! What am I going to wear?! The  stress . At least there will be good wine, I'm told.  All I can say is thankfully, there are no sporting events going on at that time, because I know I'd be dragged to them. (One of the requests he made this summer of the law firm he's working for is that we get Lakers tickets. "We." I was definitely not consulted on this.) And his parents will take us out for nice meals. And of course, I do want to see the house he grew up in. My only real concern is: where do I get to sleep?

      Anyone who knows me knows how much I hate  urlLink Vegas  (too-bright lights, too much noise, fat/sad/both people gambling away their lives, mainly buffet dining, in the middle of the desert in a landlocked state). Nevertheless, when Kevin said he was going to go in the middle of the summer for his birthday - well, how could I pass up an opportunity to drink and party with him in the sinner's capital of the world?   This probably means I'm going to be subjected to more gambling and strip clubs than I want. Oh well. It's worth it, once.   Good thing crankypants more often than not goes along with my wishes and desires. It would be such a pain otherwise.   What I want to know is why rooms are so damn expensive for summer weekends. Yes, I know, peak season, blah, blah, blah. Shouldn't they offer cheaper rooms so you spend more money gambling? Maybe if I didn't insist on at least 4-star hotels, but I'm a brat and I'm scared that anything fewer will have bugs or have cheap decor. And I  hate  those ugly nylon-ish comforters you get at cheaper hotels - all covered in germs, ew. I shudder thinking of all the bacteria floating about. Also, studies have shown that the  urlLink higher the price of a hotel room, the lower the bacteria count . So really, it's for my own health and, more importantly, peace of mind.  Anyway, go in the middle of the week, and you get rates like $89 at  urlLink The Palms  and $129 at  urlLink The Venetian . But go on the weekends, and you're looking at $349 and $309, respectively, which is just obscene. But it's okay, where we're  urlLink staying , they have 3 pools,  urlLink a beach , a river on which you can float in inner tubes and a  urlLink hammerhead shark  (which has its own reef and is not swimming around freely, obviously). And they have his and hers closets! Now I don't have to share!  On a side note, you know The Palms is a classy place when they offer a "Tattoo for you" package, that includes yes, a 1-hour tattoo session.

      This came up at lunch the other day - associating past people dated with particular places.   Before I get into this though - if you are looking to change wireless providers, or live in the stone age and don't have a cell phone - do  not  use  urlLink AT&T . Since buying a new phone from them last November, I have had nothing but trouble up the wazoo. The latest problem: my phone decided to spontaneously stop working in the 2-mile radius of my apartment. Just like that. And there's  nothing that can be done . This is rather painful for someone who is glued to her phone.   Anyhow. Back to the topic at hand. People and places. That is, the memories of a certain guy (in my case, at least) are forever indelibly intertwined with a certain location. it's what makes it so hard to return to a place after the relationship's over. There's no real rhyme nor reason to this - perhaps you first went there with a guy, perhaps it was your hangout. After all, crankypants have I have been all over New York together, but it's only parts of it I associate with him. Even though Nick visited me several times in LA, it's not him I recall when I think of that city. Just for some reason or another, your brain has equated location X with guy Y, and it's hard separating the two.   For instance,  Los Angeles  - the beaches, dining and shopping - are solely the realm of crankypants. We've explored the Westside thoroughly in the past two summers we've dated, and it's so sadly empty when I'm home and he's not there. Anytime I go to  urlLink the beach  with someone else, it's not just not quite the same.    New York , luckily, has been divided into several sections. Aside from where we went for  urlLink drinks  and  urlLink dinner  on our first date, it's the Upper West Side that I associate with crankypants, as that's where he lived the summer we were there. Midtown West and the Lower East Side is Nick, and Little Italy, strangely enough, is shithead. (I say strange because when he visited me there, we only ate there once. Yet when I think of that part of town, it's always him of whom I think.) At least I have Union Square and Nolita that remain solely mine.    New Haven  is Tom, who was really cute and whose parents came up with the use of Botox in its current incarnation. But it's where I first met him, at a bar my friends were performing at (his younger brother was the drummer), and it's where he goes to grad school now. It's not that I've ever visited him there - but every time I drive by on my way to/from New York, I always wonder how it would have been, if I had dated him instead of crankypants. I'd be promised a lack of wrinkles, at least.   Cambridge  - at least Harvard - is linked with Nick. Last night, I drove by the footbridge near Harvard on the Charles, and was immediately taken back in time to 5 years ago, when he took me there one night after  urlLink ice cream . I also remember being uncomfortable, because I wasn't so interested in him physically anymore (although that didn't stop me from drunkenly hooking up with him all the way through college - drunkenly being the key word) and he was sadly trying to woo me. It was really pretty nonetheless.    Charlottesville , of course, and  DC  are also linked to crankypants. Hopefully I'll never have a reason to return to Cville after he graduates. As cute as the city is, there's just nothing to do there.    Providence  is a bit tricky, because I've been single more often than not living here. If I had to choose, it would either be shithead or maybe even Nick. It's a toss-up though.   And  Paris , for me, will forever be that city where my friends and I all were footloose and fancy-free. I've always been single whenever I've been to Paris, and guys never crossed our minds. We were far more interested in  urlLink shopping , eating  urlLink sorbet Berthillon  and  urlLink dancing and drinking  until the sun came up - or the m&eacute;tro started operating again. And it's for that reason, even though I love the city so, that I find myself loath to bring any guy there, to show him my Paris. Like a jealous lover, I want to keep that city all to myself, pure and clean of any masculine association.  Perhaps I'm rather melodramatic, but shit, if crankypants and I break up - he's utterly associated with too many places here - I'll be on the next plane to Paris, to live out the rest of my days there. (Which doesn't sound too bad, actually. Living in Paris, that is.)

      After nearly a year of not drinking coffee, primarily because I was too lazy to go to the speciality store to buy my beans (I'm picky) - I caved.   Post-Pilates,  urlLink the bakery  yelled my name. It was so muggy outside, so hot - and nothing sounded better than the cool refreshing taste of iced coffee. They even put coffee ice cubes in it! How could I resist.  And I've forgotten how good coffee tastes. How could I have been so lazy as to deny myself this pleasure?  No longer. You're looking at a newly perpetually wired girl.  But I figure, as long as I don't pick up the bad Diet Coke habit again (again, too lazy to go to the other supermarket since  urlLink mine  doesn't sell it), I'm safe.   Then again, with that amount of sugar I put in my coffee..

      One would perhaps be led to believe via my reading selections that I'm a much smarter and more intellectual person than I really am. Must be because I'm not otherwise doing anything really using my brain this semester, otherwise you'd see a preponderance of chick lit.   Anyway, I actually like studying the rules of grammar, as sad as that sounds. Remember  urlLink diagramming ? Gosh, I really liked doing  urlLink it . It was just nice, how every word had its proper place.   Along with grammar comes punctuation. Where do you properly put periods, commas, apostrophe marks and the like? I admit that I'm not as good with punctuation as I should be, since I have the tendency to create really long run-on sentences, and then I get confused where commas should and shouldn't go, so perhaps I shouldn't be the person talking about this. But that's why I picked up  urlLink  Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation  , by Lynne Truss, over the weekend. After all, as the cover proudly proclaims, it is "The Runaway  #1  British Bestseller".   It is a very useful book, and it takes you through the proper usage of the apostrophe, comma, semi-colon, colon, dash and hyphens. It tells you when and how they should be used, their proper placement, etcetera. And it does so in a more colloquial manner than most grammar/punctuation texts, as Truss punctuates explanations with personal opinions and examples, making it marginally enjoying.   But the real reason I could barely get through the book? Dear lord, the author was obviously a vastly unpopular young adult, and decided to get her own back by becoming a "punctuation vigilante" (p34). For example: While other girls were out with boyfriends on Sunday afternoons, getting their necks disfigured by love bites, I was at home with the wireless listening to an Ian Messiter quiz called  Many a Slip , in which erudite and amusing contestants spotted grammatical errors in pieces of prose. It was a fantastic programme... Around this same time, when other girls of my age were attending the Isle of Wight Festival and having abortions, I bought a copy of Eric Partiridge's  Usage and Abusage  and covered it in sticky-backed plastic so that it would last a lifetime (it has). (p15-6) Now, it is very admirable that she loved grammar so, but there is such a thing as balance. Perhaps she could have been getting love bites  while  listening to  Many a Slip ! To each her own, Ms. Truss. Don't be bitter over the fact that you were an unpopular little chit and found solace in grammar. You can now rub it in the faces of those peers of yours who are certainly little skanky whores and who now live in trailer parks!  And I found that her manner of writing was, to use one of the author's favourite words when she was little,  desultory . So full of righteous indignition! I admit that poor punctuation is indeed grating and can vastly change the tone and meaning of a sentence if not used properly, but I don't necessarily recommend, as she does, walking around with a bottle of White-out and a Sharpie to correct all those errors. You just become annoying, after a point. Just wince, and move on.   If it "hurts like hell" (p183), these vast injustices to the English language, take a couple of advil and go to bed, sweetie. If you can get past this tone to the book, then it's quite interesting after all.

      I know that I'm going to see crankypants in a week, but that doesn't mean I can't be mopey in the interim. Anyway, to help me get over this morose state, I've made a list of why my friends and I think that he is not a real human being, but rather a government experiment let loose in in society:    He doesn't snack . I mean, who in the world  doesn't snack ? I am continually snacking. But he doesn't. There is no junk food in his apartment at all, aside from the gigantic gift basket he received from some law firm last semester which remains untouched by him. (Of course, I have removed those items which I like.) And who can walk around New York and pass up the hot dog vendors on every single corner? Apparently, he can.     He eats like a pig, yet is the skinnest person ever.  I know this might seem contradictory to the statement above, but while he might not snack, he does eat 5 meals a day. Five!!! And each one is gigantic! I mean, breakfast is a large bowl of cereal, a bagel and a half, and some fruit. My breakfast is a cup of coffee or a glass of orange juice, and maybe a third of a bagel. When we go out to eat, he eats his meal and then half of mine. Yet, he remains as skinny as a rail. Damn males and their super-fast metabolism.     He eats the most balanced meals ever.  Yes, I'm perhaps overly obsessing about his eating habits, but I have never known anyone who has such balanced meals. I think that he does actually follow the USDA food pyramid, whereas my food pyramid has a preponderance of fried food and pastries. I mean, he's a 24-year-old male. Shouldn't he want hot dogs and chips more? Who has a salad with every meal?     He studies like a fiend.  Now this, I just don't understand. I'm a rather good student, but I definitely spend more of my time procrastinating and watching TV than actually working, but everything gets done. He actually can buckle down and focus for hours at a time. I know, I've spent (too much) time in the library with him. And when he studies so intensely, he forgets to eat! Who forgets to eat?! (I know, we're back to food again.)   To add to the above statement,  he doesn't have Instant Messenger . That's right! The absolute shock! How does a student not have IM? I mean, I am glued to mine. But no, he doesn't have it! I had to download it onto his computer so that I could use it. But has he created his own screenname yet? No. He says it's an evil procrastination device. So? (But yet he's always wanting to use mine to IM my friends and say mean things. Perhaps I'm slowly converting him.)    He exercises nearly every day . See, another thing I don't understand. The only reason I'm going to the gym now is because my schedule is so loose that I can go at the leisurely hour of 8AM and still get to work by 10:30, on those days that I work. But crankypants studies obsessively, and then will take an hour break to swim laps, then return to working. Why?     He does not pick at zits nor scabs . Okay, so I probably shouldn't be picking at the rare breakout or attempting to remove scabs before their time. But isn't it human nature to want to get rid of gross things on the skin? I obviously don't have as much willpower as he does.    He sleeps exactly 8 hours a night.  Now granted, he wakes up with the aid of an alarm clock, but still. Exactly 8 hours. No more, no less. Because apparently research has shown that that's the optimum amount of sleep a person should get. Me, I'm more a fan of the if-you-have-the-time-sleep-until-you-naturally-wake-up approach.   Related to his 8-hours/sleep/night,  he also successfully takes 5-minute power naps . That's right. What the researchers say you  should  do, but once you put me down for an afternoon nap, don't expect me to wake up for a good 45 minutes, at the very least. 5 minutes is how long it takes me to fall asleep, for crying out loud. Yet crankypants manages it, and wakes up 5 minutes later, all perky and awake and shit.   I rest my case. He is obviously not human. He  does  have his faults, for example an excessive love of trucker hats and Outkast, and I don't know how to explain that. Nevertheless, I am convinced that he is a 'droid placed here on earth to taunt me with how I could be a better person, but am not.

      New York, New York. The city where I shop too much, eat too much, drink  way  too much, and never sleep enough. This weekend was no exception.  Before I get into my stories, though, let me tell you that I've forgotten how great it is being on antibiotics. Especially if you're on multiple ones, including cipro. I mean, I've had absolutely no appetite lately. Correct that: I've had an appetite, but my stomach has hurt too much for me to eat. So it's like I'm on a forced diet. It's  great . And my mother thinks that the pictures of the festering abscess look just awful. I love spreading the joy.  Anyhow, here are some highlights from the weekend:  Going to the  urlLink Conan O'Brien  taping. He is much funnier in person. I find him quite annoying on television. His hair is  unreal ; I swear it rivals Donald Trump's. Also, the set is much smaller than it looks on stage.     Going to the  urlLink Whitney Bienniel . What would have made this excursion even more fun (read: um, awkward) is if Nick had joined us, as he was planning to do. Luckily, he decided to go to a movie instead, so we were spared his contemporary art-lovin' ways.   Visiting my favourite pet store (on 62nd and Lexington) multiple times to look at Malteses. There was this one cage/kennel thingy where they had put two older Malteses, and one was totally rambunctious, basically abusing the other one mercilessly. It was quite sad, the whipped one had totally matted fur, and the abusive one had a nice shiny coat. But then, the mean one would occasionally pause its bullying to look at you with just the  cutest  face ever! How could I not fall in love with it? Plus, I obviously want the proactive dog, rather than the one that takes abuse.   Leaving an Italian restaurant Sunday night, me saying with glee, "It's time to drain my pus-filled wound!" and crankypants looking much aggrieved, saying, "That has to be the least romantic thing said ever." I'm sorry, I never considered us to be a terribly romantic couple. Hell, technically we're not even a couple, as we never had  the  talk. (Yes, it's a weak argument.) If the terms have changed, someone's supposed to let me know. I like memos. But he might also have been tired of me either talking about my plague-infested ankle, or better yet, sticking it in his face.    Having a dream that crankypants woke me up by turning on all the lamps in the room and waking up mad at him - only to find out that it was only a dream. But hey, he only lets me sleep 8 hours a night, claiming any more is unhealthy. So it could have been reality. And he wonders why I spend the rest of the day yawning. At least I got my own back by unconsciously stealing all the covers  and  sleeping smack in the middle of the bed, leaving him maybe a foot of mattress. My invisible friend wanted to sleep on the bed too, and he was obviously cold. But all of that was fun and uneventful.   But no, I know that what you want to hear about was how the group dinner at  urlLink Punch and Judy  went. Because after all, it was the first time crankypants had met Nick.   First things first. I consumed a ridiculous amount of wine that night. Ree-di-cuu-lous. To the point that, yes, there were some minor black-outs, and my response to any further plans for the evening, or any question I didn't feel like answering, was "Kick crankypants and ask him." Because I do that, and it works. But it doesn't work so well for other people, I feel.   But as much as I like to be melodramatic and stuff, the evening was rather uneventful in the end. I think. For some reason, I sat next to Nick and crankypants sat across the table from me. I'm not really sure how that worked out. And then Kevin and I spent a lot of time making fun of another friend, Julie, after she left early because she was being a morose bore. We also called up one of our friends in Seattle and "defriended" her for never calling us. She has not called us back yet. Obviously, she doesn't care. She deserved to be defriended. And then Karina and I spent a long time talking about makeup. And Nick and I obviously talked, since I couldn't ignore him as he was next to me, nor did I want to ignore him. Poor guy, he didn't really know anyone else there, yet the majority knew of him. I think I told him that I deserved a nice big birthday present from him. He better deliver on that promise.   There was lots of wine. I remember ordering maybe 4 bottles. Maybe 5. Perhaps even 6. I don't know, after awhile as soon as one bottle was empty, I waved for another. Sure, we split them amongst 3-4 people.. but still. My glass was never empty. We were there from 8:30 'til.... midnight? one? I'm not sure. That's a lot of time for my wineglass to never be empty. And then we went across the street for more drinks! Why don't people keep a better eye on me?!  And of course nothing scandalous happened. Crankypants was right there. Nick would have been stupid to attempt to touch me in any inappropriate way. I think they talked? I'm not quite sure.   Oh, and crankypants's one declaration on the subject was, "Now I don't feel threatened at all." It's rather heartwarming to think that he was somewhat worried, but now no worries? Sigh. But I guess it's better that I don't tell him that I can totally envision myself married to Nick, just not sleeping with him. (Yes, I know that presents some major hurdles. And that's why we're not dating now.)  Like I said, I wish I had gorey details. But I don't. In the end, it was just a great night out with friends.   (Unfortunately, all that booze meant that I completely forgot about the cuddle party. There was no appropriate time to bring it up, and I wasn't doing it to prove a point, or anything. Oh well.)

      So, I was going to write about the fast times I had in New York, but I feel that it's much more important to write about this festering abscess on my leg. The weekend tales will come later.  Okay, to be fair, it's not really a festering abscess. Not yet, at least. But, what it was was this slowly-growing fluid filled sac on the back of my ankle. Crankypants thought it was an extremely allergic reaction to a spiderbite. I've gotten spiderbites before, and none of them became this edemic sac. Me, I thought it was the plague. You know, spread by those nasty New York rats.   It didn't help talking to my parents, who are both doctors. My father is a particularly raging hypochondriac (see, it might be genetic after all!), and likes to prescribe me every sort of antibiotic under the sun. You know, kill every last living germ in your body, and then some. But when my mother, who is usually very prudent with prescription drugs, actually agreed with my father, saying something about possibly contracting  urlLink osteomyelitis , I knew that my own hypochondria was well-confirmed. Crankypants just rolled his eyes and told me that my taking cipro would mean I'd have three-headed babies.   My friend Kate and I went to the ER yesterday to have the plague checked out. It would probably be best to attempt to recall the later running monologue/dialogue Kate had in the car after 4-and-a-half hours in the waiting room.   Scene: It is 3 years from now, and Kate is a malpractice lawyer. This is her first case.    Kate the lawyer : I'd like to call the first witness to the stand. Kate? Why don't you tell me what happened that night in the ER.  Kate the witness* : Well, first of all the ugly-ass troll PA (physician's assistant) didn't even introduce herself, nor did she allow the patient to describe her problem. Instead, she seemed to instantly mentally label the patient a shallow frivolous 20-something and treated her as such for the entirety of the patient's stay in the ER. I don't think she even read the notes that the nurse had taken in triage, because she asked the patient how she had hurt her foot. The patient replied that it wasn't her foot, per se, but rather there was this monstrous grossness on the back of her ankle. The words "monstrous grossness" are my own, of course. The patient used some technical medical term I don't even recall.  Kate the lawyer : What did the defendant then say?  Kate the witness : She said, "You must have been wearing heels." To this, the patient said that she had actually been wearing flip-flops for most of the weekend, and anyway, that the backs of her shoes didn't come up that high. When the ugly-ass troll said that maybe her pants had been rubbing against her leg, the patient said that she had been wearing skirts the entire weekend.   Kate the lawyer : What happened then?  Kate the witness : The ugly-ass troll then asked the patient how many times she had experienced such a "blister." When the patient said that she had never received this before, and that  it kept growing , the ugly-ass troll seemingly ignored the patient's words, told the patient to sit on the bed, where she proceeded to drain the so-called "blister" not into a cup, but onto the sheets of the bed. She also did not irrigate the wound after this draining.  Kate the lawyer : So there seems to be an egregious lack of sterility.  Kate the witness : Hell yeah. On top of that, the fat assistant rummaged around in the dirty germ-infested drawers of the ER, and then dressed the patient's wound after rubbing her  unwashed  hands all over the formerly sterile gauze, before applying it to the patient's now-open wound. Why didn't she just lick the gauze too? Now, since I'm all sorts of psychic, I could have told you that this was a bad idea. I think that I could have treated the patient in the cleaner atmosphere of my bathroom.   Kate the lawyer : What else can your psychic abilities tell you?  The defense : Objection! This has no relevance to the case.  Judge : Objection sustained. Please stick to the topic, counselor.  Kate the lawyer : Yes, Your Honor. I just wanted to know if my dating life was going to perk up in the near future. Anyways, Kate, what happened next?  Kate the witness : Well, as you can obviously see - and the reason for this malpractice suit - the poor patient's foot subsequently turned purple and fell off, so she can't wear her  urlLink favourite shoes  anymore. Not to mention, this means that she can no longer walk her precious Maltese, Pookie. So on top of this horrible medical care, I think that the defendent should also be charged with pet neglect!   Kate the lawyer : Please stick to the charges, Kate. Is there anything else you'd like to add to your testimony?  Kate the witness : Oh yes, after the ugly-ass troll drained the "blister", she then proceeded to only remove half of the skin that previously covered the site of infection. She said that the rest would just, and I quote, "fall off in the shower." Now, I've had my share of blisters. First of all, to get something that big would require one to wear that particular painful pair of shoes for over four days, which is just impossible. The thing was gigantic - about two inches across and one inch high, not to mention that it protruded for at least half an inch. And the skin, after popping the blister, doesn't just fall off. You have to painfully peel it off. I'm sure you'll agree with me when I say that again was shoddy health care.   Kate the lawyer : Well, that's for the jury to decide. Is there anything else?  Kate the witness : No, that's it. And as for your dating life, soon you're going to meet and fall in love with another high-powered lawyer, whom you will initially hate but accidentally marry in Ireland -   Kate the lawyer : Isn't that a movie?  Kate the witness : Oh yeah, I tend to get my visions and movies I've seen confused.  Judge : That is quite enough. Please call your next witness to the stand, Counselor.   *Yes, Kate the lawyer and Kate the witness are the same person. Poor Kate only got 3 hours of sleep the night before last.   So in short, that's my visit to the ER. While I grudgingly admit that it may not be the plague, I feel that it's more than just a blister, given the fact that 1) it itched, 2) it wasn't caused by shoe/clothing friction; and 3) it kept growing. But I guess that we shall see. But let's not forget the fact that I now  have an open wound on the back of my ankle , that is probably full of new fat assistant/ER germs. Also, I took a year of medical interviewing and a semester of physical diagnosis. I  know  that the first thing you do is let the patient describe his/her problem before you make rash assumptions. At the very least, I know that I have a case for extremely poor medical care.   Addendum, 11h59  I remembered that I have a digital camera, so I have taken pictures of the plague to send to my mother, so she can see what a rough-shod job the ugly-ass troll PA did on my festering abscess. I only wish I had taken before-shots, too. I was going to post the pictures as well, but didn't want people losing their meals over it. Because it's really ugly. However, if you would like me to send them to you, so you can see how I'm so not exaggerating... ew, you're a sick person.

      So I go away for the weekend, and the entire format at Blogger has changed. Anyway. Much too tired to write about anything fun at this moment. And I'm also currently suffering from what has to be the absolute  nastiest  reaction to a bug bite - I have never seen anything like this before, I'm actually convinced that I'm carrying the plague or something like that. It is  so  gross that I daren't even describe it here. Anyway, I find that such things are better left to the imagination. And thus, I'm on three antibiotics which will surely kill off every other germ in my system aside from this plague one, because obviously it's so rare that common antibiotics won't kill it off. Eventually I'll have to drag my lazy ass to the ER so they can properly take care of it. But I hate the ER. It's full of contagious sick people... ooh, which could be me.  In the meantime, I leave you with this  urlLink random facts  page. It's too bad it's set up sequentially, instead of randomly, but oh well. Fun nonetheless. Did you know that rats can survive a nuclear fallout? Gross things, rats.

      And so, it's an early weekend for me. Crankypants is here, we're headed down to lovely over-crowded New York. (That's right. I work part-time. I have the best schedule ever, primarily because I get to make it myself.) Much has been planned, and it shall be a whirlwind trip, planned mainly by yours truly, because we all know what happens when I don't get my way. One would think I was an only child! - but I'm not.  While lying in bed last night, I was seized with a momentary panic. Why, you ask? Because, Friday night dinner will be the first time that crankypants has ever met someone I have been, ahem, intimately involved with.   Oh wait, I'm silly. Senior year - while we weren't dating - he came for a random visit, and met shithead (I have very good reasons for calling this particular guy shithead). At this point, I wasn't talking to shithead. But boy, was crankypants ever excited to meet shithead, and vice versa - and wouldn't you know it, guys being guys, they had a Height Contest to see who was taller. (Both are 6'4.) That's right. In the middle of someone else's birthday party, they just  had  to see who was really taller. Just - why? I will never understand guys. I was on the other side of the room downing shots at that point, so I'm not really sure who won.   I digress. Shithead only occupied, off and on, two years of my college years. Never trust guys who row crew, is my motto taken from that involvement. And also the "any guy with a 4-letter name is a bad name" theory definitely holds true.  And I don't talk to him much anymore, even though he lives in Boston, because well, he sucks. Nick holds a much more important place in my life.  But now, I don't know what to expect when the two meet. After all, Nick refers to crankypants as "that thing in Virginia." And crankypants has always been amused by stories of Nick's persistence. And now the two shall meet. What's going to happen?  Is Nick going to play cool? Or is he going to (stupidly) attempt to stake some sort of claim, and only bring up conversation topics that deal with our undergraduate years and people that only the two of us know?  And how is crankypants going to react? Is he going to be at all proprietal? After all, he seems to be very rarely jealous of any other male (much to my everlasting annoyance). Or is he just going to be amused by Nick's demonstrations, seeing Nick as a harmless Maltese trying to take on a Doberman. (I don't know, I'm not so hot with analogies these days. It's the failing memory.)  I mean, they can't have a height contest to settle issues. Poor Nick is maybe 5'9. So that's out. What else can they compare? Who has the cooler wallet? Better hairdo? Best shoes?   Thankfully, there is the buffer of 9 other people to make things better, but wait. We can't count on Kevin for any sort of help, he's only going to egg on any potential fighting. And the girls - well, I can only hope they provide some succor, but who knows. And I don't even know crankypants's friends, so there's no aid from that corner.   Maybe I'm just overreacting, as I tend to do at times, but I'm not so sure. But I can't shake the feeling that this night isn't just going to be all cool and calm. Crankypants and Kevin, after all, do like to stir the pot. The former just can't get into his head that whatever pot he's gonna attempt to be stirring involves  me . And plus, I have my  urlLink cuddleparty prank  to execute.   I'll just get raging drunk, and then I won't know what happened. The foolproof plan: when all else fails, go for denial and a lot of alcohol.   So if you happen to end up at the bar(s) we're at, I will be the one alone at the bar, wearing shoes in which I probably can't walk more than 20 feet, downing shots and making nice with the bartender.

       Hypothyroidism   What it is: A condition in which the thyroid gland fails to produce enough thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone regulates the way body uses energy. A lack of thyroid hormone affects many body systems. The body's normal rate of functioning slows, causing mental and physical sluggishness. The symptoms may vary from mild to severe, with the most severe form called myxedema, which is a medical emergency. Symptoms:  Coarse and thinning hair  Dry skin  Slow body movements  Inability to tolerate cold temperatures  Feeling tired, sluggish, or weak  Memory problems, depression, or difficulty concentrating  Thin, brittle nails  Constipation  Hoarseness  Abnormal menstrual periods  Thinning eyebrows  Decreased taste and smell For the record, I believe I have the majority of the above symptoms. Definitely the one where I am intolerant to cold weather. And the memory problems. Although the latter could be alcohol-induced. Anyway, moving on.  What causes hypothyroidism? The most common cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a disease of the thyroid gland where the body's immune system attacks the gland.  It develops when the body's immune system makes antibodies that attack and eventually destroy the thyroid gland. This results in a gradual loss of thyroid tissue and thyroid gland function. Hashimoto's thyroiditis occurs most often in women and older adults. The disease does not cause any pain and often goes unnoticed for years.   Less common causes include: viral and bacterial infections of the thyroid, disorders of the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, abnormal iodine in the diet and some medications. Rarer is it a congential condition. Prevention: There is no prevention for hypothyroidism. But you can watch for signs of the disease.  I was looking over my medical records (yes, I'm a dork and keep a copy of everything for myself), and apparently my thyroid levels were tested 3 years ago, and hover on the lower end of the spectrum. I bet by now, they've plummeted even further. By the way, additional laboratory abnormalities include increased cholesterol (check - although that could be because of faulty genes inherited from my parents) and anemia (which I had once when I tried to donate blood).  Now, off to the doctor's so she can confirm my fears. Or tell me that I'm a horrible hypochondriac. But I bet you it's the former.   (All information taken from  urlLink WebMD  and  urlLink Yahoo! Health .)

      But what's even worse, is when Harvard Square is entirely closed off due to some street fair celebrating May Day and walk for hunger. Now, I love street fairs and all (and perhaps indulged in a lobster roll and some fried dough on my walk back from the  urlLink spa ), but don't close off one of the main thoroughfares in Cambridge and try to reroute traffic down one-lane streets ridded with potholes and pedestrians who don't look when they're crossing! People in Massachusetts - and especially Boston - already cannot drive, don't make it harder for them. And if you must close off streets for a Mayfair, at least have a maypole to make it worth it. I like maypoles.   It took me a scant 40 minutes to get up to Cambridge (about 50 miles - I drive fast), but then it took me 20 - that's right, TWENTY minutes - to drive the 2 miles once I got off at Storrow Drive to my new apartment. And then it took me nearly an hour to drive down Mass Ave to get out of Boston (about 5 miles - because sadly, I don't know how else to get out of that damn city, as I always get lost when I attempt the turnpike. Someday, I will master the turnpike. Probably not soon, though.)   Now, I'm a patient person and all - haha! So not! And there is nothing I hate more than bad drivers and traffic. And it's just the  worst  in Boston. At least in LA people can drive, and everything is properly paved. There are also multiple lanes of traffic, so if something goes wrong in one lane, look, you have more to choose from! Stupid cities that were designed before cars were around. Didn't those horse-drawn carriages break down every once in awhile? And the buses in this city! They run red lights, careening into your lane and barely missing you, like they're playing a real-life version of Grand Theft Auto - and you're an expendable bystander.   And this is only the first of many trips driving my ungodly amount of clothes, shoes and other crap up to my new place. Ah, moving. The only thing worse is... I don't know what.   On a totally unrelated note, Brad Pitt or Lauren Graham? The former is scheduled for Conan on Thursday, but I'd have to miss work to see him. The latter is on Friday, so I wouldn't have to miss work, and I like her too! But  still , Brad Pitt... it's a stupid question to be asking, isn't it. Brad Pitt obviously wins.

      Continuing with my current trend of watching movies targeted to the young teenage audience, I dragged a couple of friends to watch  urlLink  Mean Girls  . Now, I actually had a good reason for this, and it wasn't that I'm trying to regress to my high school days. First of all, the screenplay was written by Tina Fey, of  urlLink  Saturday Night Live   fame. I'm a huge fan, and SNL has definitely gotten tons better recently - maybe it has to do something with the fact that she is head writer now? Who knows. Also, it was based on  urlLink  Queen Bees and Wannabes  , by Rosalind Wiseman, which I had always meant to read but unfortunately never gotten around to. The book is actually more of a "help manual" on how to deal with teenage girls as they go through that horrible stage of adolescence, and how to help them maneuver cliques, gossip, guys, etc. Ripe fodder for a satire.  The plot, basically, is as follows: Cady Heron (Lindsey Lohan) is a very pretty junior in high school who up 'til this point, had been home schooled in Africa. She is immediately adopted by the Plastics,  the  clique composed of three A-list girls, who are all pretty, rich and naturally incredibly desired/envied by the rest of the junior class. This clique is lead by the Queen Bee, Regina George (Rachel McAdams), who is incredibly mean, and everyone cowers in fear/awe in her presence. Unfortunately, Cady thinks that Regina's ex-boyfriend is cute. Obviously, Regina is not okay with it, and what follows is a whole bunch of secrecy, back-stabbing, and just plain ol'-fashioned meanness, teenage-style, including a hilarious nod to the current low-card dieting trend. Naturally, there is a happy ending that just borders on cloying, but saved from this potential fate by a runaway bus.   But it's not as saccharine as it could have been - there is definitely a sharp edge to the plot. The aforementioned runaway bus, for instance, shows up several times, to drive home (haha!) a point. There are quite a few roles played by past and present SNL cast, and those are all pretty comical, from Tina Fey as a recently-divorced calculus teacher, to Tim Meadows as the high school principal enamoured with Fey's character, to Amy Poehler as Regina's still-wanna-be-young mom. The Plastics themselves are actually very well acted, from Queen Bee Regina's sense of entitlement to Gretchen's (Lacey Chabert) sad desperation in trying to keep herself Regina's best friend, to Kylie's (Nicole Crimi) absolute ditziness. And then there's Cady, with her impossibly perfect eyebrows (where did she learn how to groom her eyebrows in the wilderness?), who upends the way high school used to be, transforming the cliques into accepting groups. How heartwarming.   This movie was definitely a good way to spend the afternoon. Much better than that piece of crap I saw last weekend,  13 Going On 30 . It was enjoyable and made me glad that my high school - at least to my knowledge! - wasn't like that. Someday, I'll get off this kick of watching teeny-bopper movies and return to more "grown-up" films, but as long as the movie studios keep churning out this stuff, I'm gonna be watching it.

       urlLink      If you've been following this at all, you'll know that this past weekend we had Brooke's Bachelorette Party. [insert super-excitement here] Very kindly, Katie's father loaned us his beach house in Orange County for the entire weekend, and also paid for all food and alcohol we consumed in his house, as well as the limo for Saturday night. (Not to be outdone, Katie's mother - her parents are divorced - paid for a very lavish dinner Friday night.) Here are some pictures from the event - all the  good  pictures are unfortunately still on my other camera, and need to be developed. But here's a taste.       urlLink     These are the monogrammed goodie bags that we put together for everyone. They all contain a personalised margarita glass and mix CD and a penis-shaped swizzle stick (nothing but the classiest!). The bride's bag also contained a tiara, an inflated penis balloon and a candy necklace. You know, the essential going-out accessories.         urlLink     This is Chad, our pin-up doll. We couldn't find pin-the-penis on the pin-up, so instead it was bow ties. We were all aiming for his neck, where a bow tie should properly go. Brooke was aiming for the crotch region, and you'll see she got quite close (hers is the brown bow-tie very close to his underwear). Me, I don't have so much aim. Mine is the one on the ankle.          urlLink     This is some of the alcohol we consumed. Note the cute festive margarita glasses. Here, we're drinking chocolate martinis - equal parts vanilla Stoli and creme de cacao, with a floater of Godive liqueur, and a rim of cocoa powder. After this, we played that wonderful drinking game, Never Have I Ever, and I learned far more about Brooke's sex life than I wanted to know.          urlLink     This is more alcohol. Please note that there are six bottles of wine. Those are Katie's dad's "cheaper" bottles. The red is a 1990 vintage. It was amazing. There was a lot more white in the fridge, along with bottles of Veuve Cliquot. We actually did not get through it all, surprisingly. But that's because after I started making Negronis (equal parts Campari, gin and Punta Mes, along with half a juiced orange), we didn't really remember that the wine existed.   urlLink     Because I am obsessed with food, this is the pizza that I made using the pizza oven. It had pepperoni, mushrooms, roasted garlic, provolone and mozzarella cheese. It was amazing. It was even better in the morning when I was hungover beyond belief. Yum. Pizza.  So Friday night was the quiet night, as everyone had to get down to the beach house. We had dinner, then played drinking games. After a day tanning outside, Saturday evening we made pizza, drank some more, then took the limo up to Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, where we went to such infamous establishments such as  urlLink Saddle Ranch Chop House , where we made Brooke ride a mechanical bull, and  urlLink http://losangeles.citysearch.com/profile/78219?cslink=search_name_noncust&ulink=search__searchslot1_520__0_profile_5_1">Miyagi's , where we danced some. I hope  never  to return to these places - they're so gross and icky, but absolutely perfect for a bachelorette party because they're full of sketchy guys who will eat candy off Brooke's candy necklace, and make a big production out of the entire affair. The penis balloon was an amazing hit. So it was fun, even if the bachelorette was more appropriately attired for an evening at the country club instead of an evening out on the town. Who wears white pants going out? But whatever. What's important is that we all had tons of fun, were very drunk the entire weekend... and ohmygod it's so scary that the next time I see Brooke will be in August, for her wedding. But I'll have a fit later about how we're too young at 24 to be getting married.   Good times were had, and that's all that matters.

      I have this disease where I think about food about 80% of the time. Maybe 90%. I am Always Thinking About Food. Where my next meal will come from. What I'm going to order at a particular restaurant. My favourite dishes at my favourite restaurants. What new restaurants have opened, and when we can go to them. Etcetc. It makes being productive really hard. But this is why I generally  always  make restaurant reservations - nothing annoys me more than going out to eat and not knowing where we're going at what time.   Anyway, last week crankypants and I went to dinner, and because it was on a weekday - well, I hadn't made reservations, because weekdays are exempt from the reservations need. So in the car, crankypants asked what I wanted to eat, and being ever-so-accomodating (as is not my wont), I responded with a very sweet, "Whatever you want."  Most people would be happy with this response. Not him. "Something's up. You always either want something or need something. I just need to figure out what." Dammit. He's smart.   Luckily, he's not that smart. He thinks I really want my white fluffy dog. While this is indeed true (one year, and he'll get me a puppy! - although he says he's  thisclose  to getting me  urlLink Linus ), what I have up this particular sleeve is that there are 2 days left to June, and then he's Dead Meat because then he will have completely forgotten  urlLink our anniversary  - and he had a very lenient 30 days from which to choose - and he's going to have to make it up in the  biggest  way. Haha!

      For all of my frivolous and spendthrift ways, there is one instance (that I can think of off the top of my head) where the norm doesn't apply: haircuts. I absolutely refuse to believe that a good and proper women's haircut should cost any more than $60, including tip. Why? All they're doing is removing hair from your head, a process which you'll have to repeat in 2-3 months time. People like Sally Hershberger who charge upwards of $600 for a haircut are just ridiculous. The people who pay for those haircuts - well, I'm not even going to begin. I grant you that a good haircut  does  make all the difference in the world, but really. $600 will buy you a pair of heels and a pair of ballet flats at  urlLink Holly Would . (There used to be a time when their shoes were cheaper than Sigerson Morrison! Ah, the good ol' days.)  But that does  not  mean that I frequent chains like Fantastic Sam's and Supercuts to get my hair cut. Please. Those places give the OCD in me chills. No. There are a perfectly good number of salons that will do the deed. And if you're in a large city like New York or LA - you're in luck. Big fancy salons will have training schools where you can get your hair cut by a student for a fraction of the price. Plus (and I know this is wrong, that you're supposed to stick with one person who will get to learn your hair, but I also have a slight case of ADD), the students rotate frequently, so you can get a different person cutting your hair each time.  Take, for instance, the Aveda Institute located in SoHo in New York. I used to get my hair cut here all the time, for the bargain price of $15, which included a shampoo using lovely-smelling Aveda products. The studio was more like a very large loft space, with lots of room for the instructors to roam around to watch their students and in case anyone had any questions, so that no mistakes would be made. Two people here stick out vividly in my mind. There was the one who oohed and aahed over my hair, and said that she  absolutely adored  cutting long layers, and she said never to colour my hair because its colour was so lovely, and that she wanted to move out to LA one day and work in a salon out there... and then she asked if I knew that my hair was ever-so-slightly thinning at one temple. Way to kill the glorious buzz of flattery. Then there was the other one, who even though she was supposed to be graduating in 2 weeks, wasn't really quite sure how to cut long layers. Thankfully the instructor was there to remind her, and I left with a perfectly fine haircut.   But then, I actually found a salon in Charlottesville with a hairstylist whom I adored so much that I went back to her repeatedly! Her name is Marlo, and she's not afraid to use a curling iron to style my hair. Ah, the good ol' South, where hair with volume is still in. Crankypants goes to her also, and she is always telling him how beautiful and smart I am, and how lucky he is to have me. She tells me that I always look so put together and that he looks so "beachy" all the time. Heehee. This might be one large reason why I love her. That, and she is the first person to fully understand what I want done with my hair, without having me to say more than, "uh, I don't know, clean the layers and add some movement?" And when I leave with loose bouncing waves (formed by a lovely large-barreled curling iron) a la those 50s movie stars, I couldn't be happier. And just-washed, the haircut is pretty perfect too.   However, I'm in LA for the summer, far far away from Marlo and her Southern charm, and I desperately needed a haircut. Was I in luck! The Vidal Sassoon Institute is located in Santa Monica, and haircuts there are only $19 on weekdays! So I left work early yesterday to check it out.   Two-and-a-half hours later (remember, they're students, they're slow - plus, I like it when people play with my hair, and I had nowhere to be, so it was fine), I left with a lovely hairdo, exactly the same as my old one but precisely 2 inches shorter, as I had requested. The place was  so  much hipper than I am - everyone there had punky and edgy haircuts, and I was worried that they'd make fun of my conservative cut - but hey, they'll meet plenty of people like me out in the real world. And my wallet was only $29 lighter (she spent so much time, I felt bad. Plus, I would have tipped that much for a decent $50 haircut). My only quibble is that apparently they're not allowed to use curling irons there (forgot that Vidal Sassoon was all about the sleekness of hair), so I had to go home to handle that.   Since I'd been threatening the last couple of weeks that I was going to have my hair cut so that it was no longer than a chin-length bob, or better yet, I was going to shave all of it off (it's currently, post-haircut, about 3 inches past my shoulders), crankypants was in a very nervous state until I met him for dinner, whereby he expelled a  huge  sigh of relief when he saw that I hadn't done anything drastic. What a weenie. Women's hair their sign of fertility and sexuality, my ass.

       Scene: In Target, looking at various hair products   Me : Seriously, I think I'm going bald. The amount of hair that clogs my drain..  Friend : Yeah, I know what you mean. It's crazy.  Eavesdropper : You know, I started losing a lot of hair when I first got pregnant... [long pause, while Friend and I give each other one of  those  looks, the what-the-hell-is-this-unwanted-intruder-doing? look]  Both of us, simultaneously : Naah...   Later, or really, as soon as Eavesdropper gets out of eavesdropping range.   Me : What the hell was she doing? Trying to scare the living shit out of me?  Friend : Well, it certainly worked, didn't it?  Me : Well, weren't you scared?  Friend : Unless I'm the Virgin Mary and there's an Immaculate Conception redux, I don't think so.  Me : Lucky you.  Friend : I don't know who's the lucky one and who's the unlucky one in this situation.  Me : We're both winners! Let's get hot dogs!  Friend : From Target? Gross. Maybe you  are  knocked up.  Me : None of that now, it's not a laughing matter. Besides, I already have my thinning hair to worry about, thanks to that lady.

      Okay, so normally I don't go see teeny-bopper movies - oh wait, that is  such  a lie! As I get older, I find that my taste in movies only gets younger. Nothing like maturity. But anyway.  urlLink Saved!  is not really a teeny-bopper movie. Sure, it takes place during the character's senior year in high school, but it's so much deeper than that.  I mean, in what normal teeny-bopper movie do you get a girl, Mary (Jena Malone), who out to save her boyfriend from being gay, thinks that Jesus is telling her to sleep with her boyfriend, even though they're ultra-Christian. And, as luck would have it, she gets pregnant on the first go. Yet her boyfriend is still gay, and he gets sent to a "rehab" hospital. Scared, poor Mary can't really tell anyone about this - because, well, good Christian girls wait.   Blahdeblah, suffice it to say that somehow Mary goes through the Entire School Year with only two people knowing that she's pregnant. It's amazing. And as it's a movie that thumbs its nose at ultra-Christians, well, hijinks ensue, and in the end there is a big moral speech about how Christianity should accept everyone, including those jewish, gay, crippled, pregnant, etcetc.   Anyway, my favourite character is Hilary Faye, played by Mandy Moore. Teeming with religious sanctity, she is Out To Save The World, and takes this role very very seriously. She kidnaps Mary and attempts to perform an exorcism. She is continually trying to convert the one Jewish girl in the school. She is not mean, per se, just so caught up in her vision of what is right that she loses her grasp on reality. I am generally not a huge Mandy Moore fan, but she plays this character well. I can't believe Anne Hathaway first had this role, I can't see her as anyone other than that ugly-duckling-turned-swan-but-that-didn't-really-surprise-anyone-did-it girl from  urlLink  The Princess Diaries  .  The best line in the movie? When Mary's mom, played by Mary-Louise Parker, who is one of my favourite actresses, finally (after nearly nine months) realises that her daughter is pregnant. "I thought she was just stress-eating, and I didn't want to give her a complex."   My only quibble is that the movie could have been sharper than it was. Full of funny moments, none were truly hysterical. But I guess you can't get too mean. I would recommend you go out and see this movie. It's a couple of hours of good fun, and let me say, I just  can't wait  for   urlLink Princess Diaries 2   (sorry, Anne Hathaway regression there, not related at all to  Saved! ).

      It is Brooke's bachelorette party this weekend! Everybody get excited! I will be excited, because I will spend the whole weekend drunk and won't know any better!  Anyway, my (cheap, yet incredibly time-consuming) contribution to the celebrations (in addition to splitting the bill for everything, sigh) is making a mix CD. I'd like it to go from relaxed and only one cocktail in hand... to dressed up, drunk as all hell and in a dancing mood.  Here is what I have so far:  The Beach Boys - California Girls  ABBA - Dancing Queen  Sheryl Crow - All I Wanna Do  AC/DC - You Shook Me All Night Long  Sugar Ray - Mr Bartender  Pink - Get This Party Started  702 - Where my Girls At  ODB - Got Your Money  Eve feat. Gwen Stefani - Let Me Blow Ya Mind  Britney Spears - I've Got That Boom Boom  Beyonce feat. Jay-Z - Crazy in Love  Nelly - It's Getting Hot In Here  Pras feat. ODB and Mya - Ghetto Superstar  Ja-Kwon - Tipsy  Mousse T - I'm So Horny  50 Cents - In Da Club  Sisqo - The Thong Song  The Divinyls - I Touch Myself  Cyndi Lauper - Girls Just Wanna Have Fun Okay, so I get to the "really drunk and dancing" part of the CD really fast. Yes, it might be cheesy, but it's not like we're looking for an obscure artsy mix here. This  is  for a bachelorette party, which aren't exactly known as events of decorum  and taste.  If anybody has any suggestions/recommendations/criticisms, please share. I mean, this CD is as integral to the bachelorette party as the seating chart is to the wedding dinner. For sure.

      For some reason, I can barely ever drag my ass out of bed in order to get up, get ready and leave for work. It's nearly impossible, which is odd because I don't have to be at work 'til 10, anyway. And on Monday mornings, it should be even easier 'cause I stay over at crankypants, thereby shaving a good hour off my morning commute.  You would think that would mean an extra hour to sleep. But oh no. Crankypants has to wake up at 6AM in order to get ready for work so he can leave at 7:30. This means neener neener, I get to sleep so much longer than he does.. no, wait, there goes sleep - does he really have to close the bathroom door so loudly? Wait, there goes his second alarm, beeping obnoxiously, because he forgot to turn it off. And then does he have to leave the bathroom door open after he finishes, flooding the bedroom with unnecessary light? So I have to haul my ass out of bed to shut the door so I'm in complete blackness again. And don't people work in this town, who the hell plays tennis at 7AM on a Monday? Of course I can hear them whacking the ball around; we sleep with the windows open because otherwise it becomes intolerably stuffy. And just when I think I can get used to the sounds of tennis and trash trucks (because Monday is trash day, after all, more rattling and banging), crankypants comes back in after eating breakfast to get dressed, and that's just more banging drawers and rattling hangers. And then he opens the bathroom door again! More light! ARGH! And then he  laughs  when I stick my head under the pillow and burrow under the sheets. The indignity of it all! Just Get Out Of Here already because I Want To Go Back To Sleep!  So when I finally get out of bed at 8:30 - it doesn't mean I've had 2-and-a-half extra hours of sleep. Oh no. I've had 150 minutes of tossing and turning, trying to avoid light and noise and trying to get back to that goshdarn good dream I was having which featured my hot hot professor in France. Darn it all to hell. How am I going to have a good Monday if I don't know how that dream was going to end?

      To follow Parts  urlLink I  and  urlLink II , of course. Dear Diary,  I guess I haven't written here in awhile, but life's been so busy. Unfortunately, Mark had to return home to California for the summer. :( :( But it is very important that he works at home, because one of the firms he is working for feeds into the appellate court system, and you know, it quite simply wouldn't do it he didn't work for an appellate judge next year. I know that each judge takes only one clerk, and there are only a couple of appellate judges in every major city - but Mark is quite the clever dickie and I just  know  he'll get one of those much coveted spots, even though gazillions of people try out for each spot. But he'll get one, and then the appellate judges feed to the Supreme Court judges, and in two years, we'll be living in DC so he can clerk for a Supreme Court judge. I am so proud of him!   It has been quite lonely since Mark left. But it's okay. My days consist of going to work, then going to the gym and talking to Mark on the phone. It is damn hard cooking for myself though; I don't know how Mark cooks dinner for us every night on top of having classes and being on Law Review. It's just because he's Mr. Perfect :) :) And I get to be Mrs. Perfect soon!!! :)   We have also been working on the wedding ceremony alot. Mark has written up everything we want to officiant to say (it helps that he writes fantasy gamer fiction on the side! He is such a good writer! So creative!!), and we have written our vows. I hope people don't mind that they go on for awhile - there's just so much that we want to say to each other in front of our family and friends. To be a little silly, I like thinking of our marriage as the formal declaration of an infinite love. THE love of the century. It's all so wildly romantic!   On a sadder front, Mom just found out that we're having a nondenominational wedding and is very disappointed. But it's hard! Mark is half-Jewish, and while I'm all Protestant, and yes, Mom and Dad are paying for it, we can't have a religious officiant. We've already written what the officiant's going to say, anyway. But Mom said that that's "not how I was raised" and that she's "very very disappointed in me." I don't know what to do! I don't want to disappoint Mom, but on the other hand I don't want to make Mark have a Protestant ceremony, because he's not one (or not completely one, anyway. I don't even want to know what Mom would have done if I married someone that wasn't at least 1/2 Protestant). But we're having four readers! Shouldn't that make her happy?   I have also been spending all my evenings working on the seating chart. It is so difficult! Thankfully, Mom is accessible all the time via phone so that we can talk about it. I don't even want to think what my long-distance bills are like! But she said that it's very important that we have The perfect seating arrangement, because this delicate balance can make or break the wedding. I thought she said the color scheme would make or break the wedding. Hm. Whatever, I know that Mom is always right :)   57 days to go! Yippee! I can't wait for our life as a married couple to begin - it's going to be so much fun!! :)   love, Brookie :) :) By the way, does anyone know if whether you elope and then have a big reception afterwards, you can still get lots of presents? Because if that's true, wow, hello Vegas!

      I think I already knew that, but it's always endearing (read: perplexing) when the above statement is confirmed.   Following on crankypants's proclamation that he wants a red hat, with pompoms.. I decided to ask Kevin, my partner-in-crime, whether or not he thought I should really add earflaps. What I learned: If the winter hat has pompoms dangling from a string, then you need earflaps. If you have earflaps, you need a dangly tie also. If the pompoms are attached to the hat rather than hanging off a string, then you don't need earflaps. If the hat does not have pompoms, it doesn't need earflaps either. Following on the heels of those cardinal rules regarding winter hats, was the request (or rather, command): "Since you haven't found me a tall blonde to date in the past year, I want a hat too. A green and blue one. Hunter green and navy blue.  With dangly pompoms. And earflaps. And the tie for under the chin. "  Obviously, it was my mistake for asking for male advice. And now I'm to make two damn crocheted hats. What do I look like, a winter hat factory? I have better things to do with my time, like eat and sleep and shop.   And I don't understand what this fascination with pompoms is. Weren't boys supposed to outgrow this once they started grade school and/or took control of their own wardrobe?

      I spend a large chunk of my day in the car. Due to traffic, when I'm driving from home to work, it can take me a good 75 minutes. Sadly, that's "fast", as before I found this "shortcut", it used to take me 2 hours. TWO HOURS to drive 35 measly miles.   But enough of that bitching. Suffice it to say, I get to spend a lot of time in traffic watching other drivers. Here are some observations, and other things that give me road rage.  When in the  hell  did people stop using blinkers? I feel like there's been a county-wide memo that I didn't receive. The entire weekend, I counted how many times the person in front of me used blinkers to change lanes. Twice. That's right. A weekend's worth of driving to the beach and around the city, and TWO people used his/her blinkers. This is how accidents happen, people.   Cutting across multiple lanes of traffic in a single swoop? You can't do it, especially if there are cars on the road (and this being LA, there are  always  cars on the road). Yet people persist in trying. If you realise that you're going to miss your turn - my advice? Miss it. Circle back around. It's not going to take that much longer, and you will then not be putting your life - and the lives of others - in danger.    Along the same lines of the above annoyance - if you know that your exit is coming up soon, why don't you merge over earlier rather than later? Wait in the slow lane if necessary. It is Not Cool when you decide to zip along then BAM! realise that oh yeah, you did want to exit/make a right or left turn here, and halt all traffic in  another  because your selfish ass didn't want to wait. I'm not gonna let you in. Especially if you try to motion to me that you wanna cut. Or better yet, just edge your way in as if I wasn't there. Didn't we learn that rule in kindergarten, about cutting in line? It's not nice.    If your windows are down, and the windows of the car next to yours are down, and you talk loudly about them - there is NOT an invisible bubble that surrounds you, keeping your mocking words away from their ears. Also related to this, when windows are rolled down, it is not advisable to play a game entitled "Spot the Hasidic Jew" which entails of you leaning out your window, pointing obviously and loudly proclaiming "twenty five!" or whatever number you're currently on. They CAN hear you. (This is not a stranger who does this, this is sadly crankypants.)    Driving is not the time to notice and remark on pretty architecture, because it takes your attention away from the road. Also, driving is not the time to read scripts or magazines, talk on the phone if you are not a multitasker, apply mascara in moving traffic or eat soup or anything else that spills. I cannot stand it when people do this. Unless one has two sets of eyes and two pairs of hands, such feats are impossible.  And a tip for those drivers, who say, daydream whilst sitting at a red light and consequently perhaps don't realise when the light turns green (not that I've, ahem, ever been guilty of this). When people give you dirty looks, or honk their horn, pass you and  then  give you a dirty look - rather than giving them the finger or returning their dirty look, stick out your tongue instead. Perhaps it's not the most mature thing to do, but the look on their faces is priceless. They just don't know what to do.

       Scene: Leaving the pool at his apartment complex.   Me :Is that crazy lady giving food to the security guard?  Him : Yeah, she knows her place in life. Women should keep the house clean, feed their men, and always have cookies baking in the oven.  Me :  [No words, just a dirty look]   Him : Hm, but I don't even like cookies.  Me : I'l make you cookies if we get to see  The Stepford Wives .  Him : The irony in that statement...   Scene: Eating  urlLink dinner .   Him : So I was walking back to my car after work the other day, when the strangest thing happened. This woman - she wasn't homeless, it might have been understandable if she was homeless and crazy - walked by me and said, "You're handsome," and just kept on walking.  Me : Welcome to my world.  Him : You mean this happens to you?  Me : Well, it's usually men who comment, not women, but yeah.  Him : Really?  Me : Uh huh.  Him : They just walk by you and make comments?  Me : Yes.   Him : Even though they don't know you?  Me : All the damn time.   Him : Seriously?  Me : Yes!  Him : Wow, men are assholes sometimes.    Scene: Driving home after  urlLink brunch  .  Me : I forget that I don't really like their hollandaise so much.   Him : Aw, well, I'd make you hollandaise sauce if I could.   Me : That's so nice of you!  Him : But I can't, so no hollandaise. Unless it comes in a box. Does hollandaise come in a box?  Me : You heathen.    Scene: Driving to the beach through Brentwood, where lots of people are out walking their dogs. A lot of those dogs are small, white and fluffy.   Me : OOOH! WHITE PUPPIES!!!  Him :  [groans]   Me : I really think you should buy me  urlLink Linus . He would love me so much. We can even get him on the way back from the beach.  Him : That dog has a prehensile tail, I bet.  [Note: You see, Linus climbs trees. He's a monkey dog!]   Me : So we'll keep it in your apartment.   Him : It would pee in my bed.  Me : But only if you were mean to it.  [Awhile later; we've since moved on to the discussion of the number of children we (individually) want - for the record, I want 2 girls and a boy, while he wants 2 boys and a girl]   Him : You see, I always wanted a younger brother.  Me : Boys are pains in the asses. I'm having two girls and a boy.   Him : Girls are pains! Always so moody, and you can't play catch with them.  Me : What 1950s universe do you live in? Anyways, maybe now I want three girls who I can dress up.  Him :  [groans]   Me :  (in a moment of inspired genius)  And I'm going to give each of them their own little white fluffy dog to take care of!  Him : That will be the most emasculating experience ever.  Me : Whatever, you want a pug. Like that's not a girly dog.    Scene: Sitting on the couch, after I mistakenly divulged that sometimes I crochet while watching TV.   Him : Can you make me a hat?  Me : A what?  Him : A red hat!  Me : I can just  buy  you a red hat if you want one so badly. Or you can buy one for yourself.  Him : But it would be so much more special if you made me one. A red one. With pompoms.  Me : Pompoms. What are you, five? Do you want earflaps too?  Him : Yes! I would wear it all the time!  Me : That's precisely the problem.

      And so, it has been a quite stressful weekend for Our Little Heroine. First she and Stupidhead nearly break up, and then it seems like nothing has changed. What's going on?  Now it's Monday morning. She wakes up when Stupidhead's alarm goes off at 6:30, but manages to fall half-asleep while he gets ready for work. Then in that hazy dreamlike state of semi-consciousness, she realises that she doesn't want to wait until Friday [he has more orientation stuff this week, which she does completely understand] to talk about this again, because she can't stand this state of purgatory for that much longer. So she dozes off and on until he's actually ready for work, and when he comes over to the bed to kiss her goodbye, she finally sucks it up and blurts it out. OLH: So where are we? S: Where are we what?  OLH: Where are we with this relationship? [Meanwhile thinking,  Do I need to be spelling this out? Where do you think I was last night, you big flaming moron? ] S: I think we're good. [Silence. There's just dead silence as she tries to process this. Hello, what was the angst of the last two days all about then? Maybe she  had  been dreaming.] S: We have some things that probably need to be worked out, but I totally think it's doable. I wasn't thinking clearly on Saturday, and I'm feeling better about things now. We can talk about it on Friday, if that's okay? OLH: I mean, it'd be a shame to throw 2 years away like that, without even trying. S: I agree.  OLH: So we're good? [Still, she's somewhat confused.] S: Yes. Now go back to sleep, you don't have to be up for another two hours. OLH: Okay. Have a good day at work. S: You too. And that's that.   Perhaps, she muses later that morning, if she bashed her head against the wall enough neurons would come loose so that she'd be able to understand his thought processes. Or maybe she could bang his head against the wall so that hopefully his neurons would reconnect and he'd make sense.   Either way. Whoever said that women are the more complicated sex? As evidenced by this story -  perhaps not . Make that  definitely not .  Moral of the story: Starting a conversation with "I've been thinking, maybe it's better if we break up" is NOT the way to deal with such matters, especially if you're going to recant that statement in 24 hours.  Moral #2: Dogs are infinitely preferable to men. They are not so contrary. And if anyone is looking to get Our Little Heroine a dog, she would like to point you to  urlLink this page . Or  urlLink this one . Or even  urlLink this .  THE END.

      So, where did we leave off yesterday? Oh, that's right. Our Little Heroine was zipping up the 101 to Santa Barbara. She first made an hour-long detour at  urlLink Summerland  to relax on the beach there, and debated whether or not to indulge in fish tacos, but since she has an upset stomach due to all this angst she unfortunately had to forego them. Then, she meets up with her Fabulous Friend, who, being indeed fabulous, took her to an  urlLink art exhibition opening , where they proceed to get drunk and gorge themselves on the marvelous hors d'oeuvres, and then it was onto a  urlLink music festival , which, Bach being Bach, a little drawn out and overdone, but it was pleasant nonetheless sitting under the stars drinking champagne.  The next morning, over a scrumptious breakfast of homemade waffles with strawberries, they talk about the entire situation, and really, about how Ridiculous and Frustrating Stupidhead was being. Stupidhead and Our Little Heroine had just visited Fabulous Friend last weekend, and Fabulous Friend thought that they were just so cute together, and that he obviously cared about Our Little Heroine, so she wasn't quite sure where it all came from. Perhaps, Fabulous Friend suggested, it was because Stupidhead had never had to work at a relationship before, and didn't know what to do.  After an afternoon spent shopping and sunning on the beach (as a matter of fact, the title of these posts comes from a t-shirt Fabulous Friend picked up at  urlLink while shopping , and it is also apparently (the beginning of) a rather well-known French quotation), Our Little Heroine decide that she didn't really want to wait a week in this state of turmoil, and that she and Stupidhead need to finish duking it out now.   So she calls him. Asks if he was free. He is, and she says she'll call again when she's closer to Los Angeles to find out where they can meet. Now, keep in mind, Our Little Heroine knows that she's dating a lawyer, and that he's much better at oral defense than she is, so she has a four-page letter all prepped and ready, key points underlined so that she wouldn't forget anything. She hugs Fabulous Friend goodbye, and pops back onto the 101 towards LA.  When she gets off the freeway, she calls Stupidhead. OLH: I'm at Laurel Canyon, where are you? S: I'm at the Farmer's Market and about to get dinner. Have you eaten yet? OLH: Uhh. No. S: Do you want to get dinner? OLH: Okaaaay. So already, this isn't going as she had anticipated. She has this letter that she wants to get out! And now! But she's not gonna bring it up first; she's gonna wait and see what kind of hijinks he's up to.  She picks him up, and they decide upon a nearby  urlLink indian restaurant  for dinner. He plays with her hair during the drive over. She's just confused at this point. Then at dinner, he bandies around all these sentences that start with the word  We .  We should see the new Harry Potter movie. We should go back to that  urlLink comedy club  we went to two summers ago. We should see the Stepford Wives movie when it comes out. We shouldn't make Katie mad, we want to go to her beach house after all. We We We. At this point, Our Little Heroine is positively bemused. She doesn't know what to say. It was like the fight had never happened, that it had just been a bad dream. And she'd bring it up, but a restaurant is no place to have such a discussion.   So dinner is finally over, and they're back in the car. She doesn't really quite know what to expect at this point - will she just be dropping him off at his apartment, or will she be coming up? He answers that unspoken question quite nicely: "We should check out the stuff I bid on on Ebay." Then he up and tells the parking guard that she'll need an overnight parking pass so she can spend the night. Our Little Heroine rubs at an ear, maybe she's just gone delusional at this point. Didn't he just say the previous day that maybe it would be better if they ended their relationship? What's happening now?   Befuddled, she rather passively follows him back to his apartment. Maybe they'll talk there. They've  gotta  talk there.  But what happens? He checks his purchases on Ebay, so she goes into the living room and turns on the TV to this new great  urlLink show  on the WB that she hopes will be as good as  urlLink  Young Americans   was, but prospects are dim. Really, she's just biding her time, waiting for him to be done with his damn auctions so they can talk. Finally, he comes out, and instead of actually starting a discussion, he sits down next to her and cuddles.  Cuddles . Can we say  flummoxed ? Because that's the state she's in right now. Then after some nuzzling and caressing, he gets up and irons a shirt for work tomorrow, all the while chattering away. And then he gets ready for bed, because he has to be up at 6AM the next morning.. and not knowing what else to do, she dumbly follows suit, because what else can be done? He's going to bring it up at some point, right? Maybe after he finishes taking a shower? Maybe when he's done brushing his teeth? Maybe when they're in bed? But no. He opens up his bedtime reading and pulls her close, and she falls asleep because yeah, she falls asleep at the drop of a hat.  Do I finish the story now? There's only a little left. But this is already long enough. So I'll string you all on for another day. After all, Our Little Heroine had to wait that long to get her questions answered.

      One fine bright sunny Southern California Friday, Our Little Heroine wakes up in a royal funk. "I can't date a lawyer," she thinks to herself. There's no rhyme nor reason to it, there was no stimulus to provoke such a thought - it's... well, just because. And so, she goes through the whole day, in this  mood  of all moods. It might help to add that such moods are on an exquisite monthly cycle, if you know what I mean. And generally she eventually sees how ridiculous she's being, but it takes her awhile to work herself out of such a state.   But anyway. She's in a state. Anything will push her from merely being in just a state, to being in a  brooding  state, which involves cold shoulders, no smiles and a pointed nonchalance. And of course, as could only be expected, she did get pushed over the edge. First of all, her boyfriend, let's call him Stupidhead, gets out of work an hour later than expected, so she's stuck wandering around until his roommate gets home so he can let her in to rest. And then on top of that, he tells her that the firm event he had thought she could go to on Saturday? Right, it's summer associates only; their significant others are not invited.   Normally, she'd deal with this in a level-headed matter. Not today. And poor Stupidhead has never had to deal with her in one of these moods before, because their relationship is primarily long-distance, and he's not around when she's in this state.   And she'd like to stay in, but it's Stupidhead's roommate's birthday, and it wouldn't do for her to be at dinner. So she goes, largely ignoring Stupidhead or just shrugging off his questions with a bored, "I don't care," while gaily talking to the rest of the table. Stupidhead is not a complete dunce, and he picks up on it, so At The Table, while the others are engaged in conversation, he asks her what's wrong.  If he had had to deal with her in this state before, he'd know that the wiser thing to do would be to leave her alone, as 90% of the time she can coax herself out of the state, because she does realise that they sometimes border on the unreasonable. But could he let sleeping dogs lie? Oh no. So he prods and pushes at her until, in a burst of quiet anger, she asks him, "Is the entire summer going to be like this?"  There is no need for a scene-by-scene recap. Suffice it to say that he says something - she doesn't remember, because by this point she is well on her way to becoming nice and blackout drunk, and they party on like usual and eventually go to bed.  The next morning, Our Little Heroine wakes up and sits in bed and stews for awhile. Stupidhead has already woken up, and she can hear the drone of CNN from the living room. It doesn't help that she's hungover. Finally, she gets up to get a glass of water, and returns to the bedroom to play on the computer. By this time, surprise surprise, she is in a slightly better mood, and wants to get to the beach. Then Stupidhead comes into the room, reclines on the bed, and says, "I've been thinking; I think we should end this relationship."  Yes, this comes as somewhat of a shock. After all, aside from the previous night, she thought things had been going along swimmingly. Also, this had nasty echoes of last summer's talk, where he started out in the same manner. And it turned out that he had some stupid misperceptions that he drew up out of thin air, and everything worked out then. So they talk. He says that this is only the beginning of his work experience, and that it's only going to get worse, and that obviously she can't deal with these work time commitments, and that perhaps it's just better to end it now. That for the past week, he had been thinking over whether to make things more serious or not, but that he's leaning towards the latter.  She counters this with a, I think we can work on it, it's stupid just to end it right now, and besides, my problems with your time aren't that, per se, they're just safe non-emotional manifestations of a greater problem I have, that namely, for the past two years, she hasn't quite known where she's stood on his priority list (because really, these two  never  talk about anything that might touch on the emotional realm), and that it's kept her more or less in a state of anxious limbo. That's right,  two years in anxious limbo , because she was always too chicken-shit to bring it up. And that while she doesn't want to force him to stay in a relationship he wants no part of, she thinks that they  can  work things out.   And so they talk back and forth like this. Our Little Heroine is getting increasingly frustrated that Stupidhead refuses to see her point, and.. well, eventually it winds down, with him saying essentially that there needs to be a change of some sort, and that he needs a week to think. So she'll give it to him, what else can be done? Contrary to what she was thinking on Friday, she's not ready to end it yet.   Then - and this is the best part - they go to move her car, she showers while he swims laps, she picks him up and they go grab lunch. He picks up some beignets for her while he's getting his gumbo as she gets her sushi, and then she feeds him pieces of salmon roe because he's never had any before.  It's like nothing ever happened  - except that it did.   And she drops him off at his apartment, as she's escaping to Santa Barbara 'cause she  needs  to get out of town, as all of this was entirely too much for her poor system, and she knows that her Fabulous Friend who lives up there will understand and help her talk things through. And he asks her to call him tomorrow, as though she was just leaving on a normal weekend trip, instead of a fleeing caused by his asinine ways.  So we leave Our Little Heroine in a most upset state, as she's driving up the 101 with the music blaring and the wind whipping through her open windows. What happens next? For the conclusion to this little tale, tune in tomorrow. It has quite an unexpected twist.

      Disclaimer: The nail salon I frequent is in Beverly Hills, not because of its chi-chi location but rather because two years ago, it was located across the street from my  urlLink place of summer employment , thereby making it super-convenient to get touch-ups during my lunch breaks. They also do the best $20 french pedicure I've gotten so far, and they don't give me weird looks when I specify  urlLink Essie's  Ballet Slippers for the tip and Mademoiselle for the base. (Believe me, it looks just like your natural nail, but better.) For these two reasons, I will return faithfully, even though it is now rather out of my way. Yes, it might not seem like a big investment if you spend $20 elsewhere for a bad pedicure - but think about it. If you get a bad pedicure, you have to go in even sooner to fix your toes, and then you end up spending more money than if you had initially just gone to a tried and true place. Plus, people at other salons think I'm crazy if I request my very specific pedicure colours. I've actually had people ignore me and do what they wanted anyway. What happened to the customer always being right? Maybe I  don't  want fake white tips.  Anyway, because of it's prime location, you get a lot of interesting people in there. A nice mix of people with too much time on their hands (that sadly includes me), lots of plastic surgery and collagen and Botox, tight tight outfits, expensive handbags and sunglasses and car keys, big bling-bling jewelry, etcetc. It is simply unbeatable for people watching. Take, for example, the two people I was sandwiched between yesterday.  To my left, you have an elderly man, maybe in his late 70s or so. He is impeccably dressed, with a very nice navy blue blazer - complete with pocket kerchief - in the style that only older distinguished men can pull off. He has a very kind face, like that of a simply adorable yet slightly forgetful grandfather. He has been escorted in by a woman of about equal age - her lips overly collagened, in a proper mint green "ladies who lunch" outfit, matching pashmina draped over one shoulder. He has been sat down in the salon chair, and told by this woman (in very clearly enunciated Spanish) to stay in the salon when he is done as she and another lady are going to go to Saks and to not leave under any circumstances, they will return shortly. He is no novice to the world of manicures for men - in stilted yet precise English, he instructs the manicurist to, "File the nails to an oval. Cut the cuticles very very close and clean. Two layers of clear polish." He appends to this a rather odd request, "Do you have somebody here who can clean my ears for me?" Unfortunately, they do not, as this is not a full-service salon. But his nails are filed and polished to his liking, his ears left alone, and he is later escorted over to a sofa to wait for the two women. Like the adorable old man he is, he falls asleep, and wakens only when one of the women wakes him up, kissing her hand as she rouses him.  That was a rather sweet picture. Now, take the guy to my right.  In he comes, swaggering, an aura of expectancy surrounding him. That is the best way to describe his walk - he's a swaggerer, and with certainly good reason! He is still dressed in his scrubs and is wearing a white lab jacket over them. On the upper left hand side under his name, the words "plastic surgeon" are proudly embroidered. He is tall, perhaps in his late-30s as he's starting very slightly to bald. Haven't we heard of Propecia yet, darling? My boyfriend in his early-20s is already on it, as a preventative measure. Digression aside, did I mention that he's wearing ultra-trendy sunglasses, a mix between aviators and wrap-arounds, that he does not deign to take off at any point? Perhaps he has them on so he can perpetually mentally evaluate what new-and-improved body parts he would give others as he strolls through life. And so, a-struttin' in he comes, sinking himself into the chair to my right, and immediately, he starts drumming his fingers on the table. Everyone's busy tending to other customers, but no, that does not matter. Mr. Plastic Surgeon is here, and he is busybusy, and must be taken care of immediately.  After all, he is one of those Very Important People. Too bad my nails were done at that point, I would have loved to have observed him further.  A rather interesting slice of life, if I do say so myself.

      Please remember that you are not living by yourself this summer. That means that your penchant to walk around in just your underwear should be confined to the areas of your bedroom and bathroom, and nowhere else.   This also goes for when you're staying with crankypants. He has a roommate this summer. Said roommate already thinks you're slightly off-kilter. Do not further add to this impression, unless you can blame it on the alcohol. In which case, he'll already be passed out and won't see you in your skivvies. And then it's okay.

      Because I am me, I like to keep this relationship on its toes. I mean, I can't let crankypants kick back and assume that everything is okay all the time, even though it pretty much is 85% of the time. Oh no. What would be the fun in that? I mean, I'd get bored.  So I like to see how far I can drive crankypants to the edge, without quite pushing him over. I don't do anything mean, necessarily. I just subject him to lots of excited squealing every time I see  urlLink http://www.moonlightkennels.com/idsearch.asp?ID=01MT100">cute white fluffy dogs  or adorable children. Or I make him see movies, like  urlLink  Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!   and  urlLink  L'Auberge Espagnole  , which are markedly without much intellectual stimulation and feature some overdone cheesy plot. Or I whine about how hungry I am, or how I didn't get enough sleep. Or I beat the pants off him at Scrabble, causing him to declare the game closed even though I have plenty of usuable tiles, because I'm creaming him by 60 points. Then there was the entire  urlLink cuddleparty thing , which unfortunately fell through. You know, stuff along rather innocuous lines.  Ah, but I've come up with something better now. You see, we don't really have a specific day picked out for our anniversary. It's a rather complicated story - we dated the summer, starting that  June , after our junior year of college, didn't see each other for nearly an entire year (hey - it was just a summer fling) until he came to visit April of senior year. Then we happened to both be in LA that following  June , and have been dating since then.   The first time I brought up our lack of specific anniversary date was last year, as we were approaching one year. You don't understand what a milestone this was for me. Hell, I'd never even made it more than a month being completely faithful to someone. Back to my point. I posed this question to him, and he responded, blithely and clueless as ever, "May? I think May? What do you think?"  I had one problem with this - as I emphasized two paragraphs above, we started dating both times in  June . Not May. As a matter of fact, May was the latter part of my slutty phase of college, but I couldn't really tell him, "Well, May doesn't really work for me because there were at least 3 other guys that month." There are some things one's boyfriend doesn't really need to know. Hey, I would have even bought April, as we saw each other again that month. So I (very patiently) explained that May Just Would Not Do, since we'd never even saw each other in the month of May before. Apparently a mutual friend even told him the error of his ways.  And I thought that that was that. Problem solved. Well, except for the fact that he gave me this fuzzy elephant photo album purchased at  urlLink Pottery Barn Kids  as some sort of half-assed anniversary present. Yes, I love that store, but I also love  urlLink Barneys  and  urlLink Cartier , and the latter two would have been so much more up my alley. Thankfully, I was drunk off my gourd when he gave me the photo album, so the excited squealing came easier.   Then last month, while we were in New York, one of his friends asked us when our anniversary was. Did he say June? Oh no. He said APRIL. I was flummoxed! Didn't we already go over this? And at least if he's gonna mess up, he should be consistent. Of course I corrected him. And he said, "Well, it's definitely early June then," but still, no date was specified.   So,  the test  is this: I'm not going to mention our anniversary this month. I'm going to see if he remembers on his own. And come July 1, because believe me, he's not going to remember it, I'll throw a nice and proper fit.   Sure, this means that I potentially sacrifice whatever present he could have bought for me. (He has since improved - slowly - in that department.) But hey, at least then I don't have to figure out what to get him, the guy who has everything. And sure, call me an evil scheming manipulative passive-aggressive wench. That's fine. He deserves it for continually forgetting. I'm giving him  a whole month  - not even narrowing it down to a particular day. So as I see it, he has 30 chances to figure it out.   And 30 chances to mess up.  Mm, I can't wait for the much-beleaguered look I get to give him come July.

      And indeed, it was a lovely weekend.  Got my  urlLink fish tacos , and was a very happy camper.   Saw two movies -  urlLink one  my choice,  urlLink one  crankypants's choice.   urlLink Did   urlLink some   urlLink shopping .  Sat by the pool or on the beach, depending on our level of laziness.  Ate a lot, drank a lot, slept a lot.  Really, that's all. The weekend was full of banal yet weird exchanges like the following: me: I think I need to cut my hair, there's just too damn much of it. crankypants: No, long hair is a sign of fertility, we want to keep you looking fertile. Even in retrospect, I have no idea where this came from.  Anyway, now I don't have to be at work 'til 10.  What more could one ask for?

      ... people pop up. Just when you need them to.  It's like fate, or something.  So by now, it's no secret that I went to a university with ivied halls. So did my friend Katie (of the famed beachhouse) - but she went to  that  school up north. (The one whose ranks I will be joining in the fall, yes,  that  one. 'That', by the way, must always be said with a wrinkled nose. Because my alma mater is obviously so much better.)   It always galled her that I had more friends from her institution than she did. Not my fault she wasn't terribly social, and that whenever I went up there I met people and kept in touch. And it has served me well. More or less. Guys from that school  love  me. Primary examples:  urlLink Nick , aka the one who just won't give up and  urlLink Nicky , aka the Harry to my Sally. Hell, I've gone to more alumni socials for her school than mine.   There's another guy who used to work on a rather well-known comedy rag at that school. While it's been claimed by other people that he's had a massive crush on me.. well, I don't think so. Or I like to feign oblivion. I don't find him attractive at all, that's why. He's actually a massive dork. But he's a great one for bantering. And I like my admiring throng to have brains. (Goshdarnit, I'm such a narcissist that one would think I was a Leo or a Scorpio. But no, I'm a Virgo.) He lived above Katie her freshman year, that's how we met - I'd go upstairs to play Mario Kart with the boys while Katie studied. (I'd also go drinking with her roommates while she studied - and one wonders why I had more friends there.) He invited me to see the super-secret building that houses said comedy rag one Halloween, which is an impressive edifice indeed, full of gothic touches and secret rooms. (Katie was specifically not invited, which annoyed her to no end. Haha! Why are Katie and I still friends? Why, because I am  that  wonderful of a person. 'That' said without wrinkling your nose this time, please.)   And over the years, we've casually kept in touch. Hm, he needs a name. Let's call him Comedy Man, because that's his schtick. He has written for Dave Letterman and Carson Daly. And every once in awhile he gets in touch with me. Since graduation, he's been bouncing back between New York and Boston, depending on where he can get a job writing. I think it's been at least a good eight months since I've seen him at some house party in New York.   While I was sitting on my lazy ass last night, he popped up on IM.   Him : Madam?  Me : Sir?  Him : Yes indeed.  Him : It's been some time. [Yes, we talk like this to each other on IM. It's amusing. He's weird, and I like to follow suit.]  Me : That it has.  Me : How are you? Where are you?  Him : Hollywood. And yourself?  Me : You're kidding! I'm home for the summer!   Him : Well, then it's essential that you come to a party I'm having tomorrow night. We did some cursory catching up, wherein he said something about withdrawing contributions to his alma mater because I'll be going there in the fall. Bleeeh. They obviously need someone like me up there, all those tightasses.   Did I mention that a good half of Hollywood is staffed by grads from  that  school? (Again, the nose wrinkle please.) Hopefully not all of them will be there - the ones who work for the big agencies are pricks. Nonetheless, it'll be interesting to see who he invites. His parties are always full of weird and random people, but they're fun.   And, of all the lovely irony? He lives - literally - around the corner from fuckwit. So close that I thought Mapquest was going to mock me for mapping it out. Less than a quarter of a mile.  It's a small - really, a teensy - world.

      So on the radio the other morning,  Kevin and Bean  said that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner were seen canoodling in Vancouver. Does that mean Michael Vartan is single again? Hellllooooo!! I am here! If anyone can help me find him, in a manner that does not entail a  urlLink Craigslist post , I will forever be in your debt.   Anyhow. Onto Brooke's Wedding Countdown. Previous installments:   urlLink one ,  two  and  urlLink three .  Dear Diary,  16 days until the big day!!! I am so excited!! :) I have been thinking about this day and night, night and day, and I just cannot wait to become Mrs. Mark XXX. All my fondest dreams will come true the moment I utter the words, "I do." I can't wait!  I am rather upset, however, that of the 185 people we invited to the wedding, only 125 are showing up. It is rather disappointing. Do they not realise that this is  the  premier social event of the century - no, the millenium? Just because I haven't talked to some of these people in over seven years does not give them the excuse to not attend my wedding - after all, it is  the  most important day in my life! True, a lot of them were my mother's friends, as I do not have so many because who needs friends when you have a man :) But some were people from high school! I know I haven't talked to them since graduation, but still. I am hurt :( I suppose a more intimate wedding is not such a bad thing, but I want  everyone  to experience this happy occassion!   Did I not send out the invitations early enough for them to clear their schedules out? But I thought three-and-a-half months would be ample time! Yes, yes, I know that you're not supposed to send invites out 'til six weeks to two months before the wedding, but I was so excited I could barely hide it! Much less contain it! :)  Well, at least I get wedding presents from all of them! I need to remember to update the registries and see if there's anything new that I want - good thing that people can still send gifts up through a year after the wedding date. I'm also running out of gifts on the registry because I am having two bridal showers, and I want to make sure that there's lots of available stuff for people to give me. There are these new Waterford crystal goblets that Mom says I just  have  to have, because it just would not do if I was without them.   Oh! Mom is on the phone to go over the wedding schedule. We touch base at least three times a day regarding the wedding now, since the Big Day is so close. I will write more later! :)  love, Brookie :) :)

        urlLink Payback Time: Why Revenge Tastes So Sweet   Acts of personal vengeance reflect a biologically rooted sense of justice, they say, that functions in the brain something like appetite. Alternately voracious and manageable, it can inspire socially beneficial acts of retaliation and punishment as well as damaging ones. The emerging picture helps explain why many people who think they are above taking revenge find themselves doing nasty, despicable things, and how unconscious biases pervert what is at bottom a socially functional instinct.  "The best way to understand revenge is not as some disease or moral failing or crime but as a deeply human and sometimes very functional behavior," said Dr. Michael McCullough, a psychologist at the University of Miami. "Revenge can be a very good deterrent to bad behavior, and bring feelings of completeness and fulfillment."  ... Using brain-wave technology, Dr. Eddie Harmon-Jones, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin, has found that when people are insulted, they show a burst of activity in the left prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that is also active when people prepare to satisfy hunger and some cravings. This increased activity, Dr. Harmon-Jones said, seems to reflect not the sensation of being angry so much as the preparation to express it, the readiness to hit back.  The expression itself is all pleasure. In one recent experiment, psychologists demonstrated that students who were ridiculed were far less likely to avenge themselves on an offensive peer if they had been given a bogus "mood-freezing pill," which they were told blocked the experience of pleasure.  "We've shown many times that expressing anger often escalates and leads to more aggression," said Dr. Brad Bushman, a psychologist at the University of Michigan who conducted the study, "but people express it for the same reason they eat chocolate." Now I have to admit, I think about acts of revenge about 500 gazillion times more than I execute them - usually because my plans are so elaborate and depend on so many factors that their actually happening is a near impossibility. That, and I'm scared of the consequences sometimes, or that my carefully-thought-out plan might backfire and adversely affect me.   But apparently there is a biological reason that I've been thinking of ways to get back at fuckwit. After all, before this incident, I was  always  the dumper,  never  the dumpee, and while I enjoy the pity I get from being the maligned one - well, it doesn't sit right with me. I'm supposed to always get my way! That's the way this world is supposed to work.   And of course, thoughts turn to  urlLink revenge . There are a score of petty things I can do - but as always, the best one is to accidentally run into him with a hotter and smarter guy who is absolutely nuts over me. Seeing that fuckwit lives nowhere near me, this would've been rather hard to accomplish in the near future, or at least until he moves to LA. And then LA is a large city, so those hopes are dashed. He'd have to hear vicariously through his roommate that I was seeing people, and that's not as good as actually having to encounter me with a new beau in person.   Or so I thought.   Yeah, I might have gotten back in touch with  urlLink cute British guy  and have actually been good about responding to emails, as contrary to my leaving them in the inbox to collect (virtual) dust for months at a time. And I know that CBG has had a crush on me since we met last summer - but alas, nothing could happen then. (And to be honest, I am far more interested in his hotter younger brother, who has his JD/MBA and lives in the US, as opposed to England. But I digress.)   Lo and behold, CBG recently emailed to let me know that he had just bought his plane tickets to Southern California for the last two weeks of December. Ah, I can't be completely vain and assume that it's just to see me - his parents have a second home in Newport Beach. But I know that part of it is to see me as well. How do I know? Because he told me so.   And that is the beauty of it all. Did I mention that fuckwit's parents are on sabbatical this following year, and have rented a lovely house in Laguna Beach? For those of you who don't know Southern California geography, the Laguna Beach is 10 miles south of Newport Beach. Laguna is also about 8 miles north of Katie's beachhouse.   Odds are high that at some point over winter break, I'll be at the beachhouse. Odds are also high that I'll see CBG at some point down there, so I can meet his family (and hopefully his younger brother!) And Newport is fun and all, what with the enormous mall there - but really, I love  urlLink Laguna . I'll take any excuse to go there. It's a  urlLink cute artist's community  with tons of charming shops and galleries. And it's a teensy city. Not so much a city as.. well.. a small town, I suppose.   Now, wouldn't it just be delightful if I happened to run into fuckwit's parents - or better yet, fuckwit himself - in the company of CBG? Did I mention that CBG is tall, cute, smart (MD/PhD from Oxford, of all lovely institutions) and has a British accent? And that as he's on his rotations, he only has enough free time to work out tons? Ah, but the heart flutters.   And he's absolutely crazy about me.    It's almost too perfect.   I just can't decide which would be more satisfying. To run into fuckwit or his parents.  Sweet revenge/fulfillment is so close, I can almost taste it.   (Yes, I know that December is a ways off. But this is excitingly viable, rather than just another fuzzy dream, which makes it.. well, exciting.)

      I realise I forgot to mention one of the highlights of Vegas, primarily because I couldn't categorise it under any of my guy categories. Oh, perhaps I can:  The clueless guy.   But first, a bit of background so that this all makes sense. Kevin had decided to come to Vegas for his birthday, inviting a couple of high school friends to join him. Upon hearing that, Dave (who also attended our illustrious university and who I knew since we had many friends in common. I even think I was his band's groupie at one point) decided to come too because his birthday is the day before Kevin's, and he had heard such great tales from the last time Kevin had been there. I always thought Kevin and Dave were good friends, because they booze together in NY all the time. Little did I know that Kevin considers Dave a "whiny little bitch," and did not want him at all in Vegas, because Dave would be whiny and wouldn't want to spend money - and Vegas is definitely the wrong city to go to if you're looking to be frugal.   The clincher came when Dave - who had told Kevin and his friends that they could stay in the free hotel rooms that Dave's uncle procured for him - rescinded his offer. Apparently, Kevin was inviting just too many people, and Dave was afraid that the hotel would somehow find out. (Technically, you're only supposed to have 4 in a room, but like the hotel doesn't have better things to do than to count the real number of people staying in a room - unless you're in Italy, that is. They're mean about that stuff over there). Since they would have been one over the technical limit, Dave disinvited them from staying in his free rooms. Even more annoyed at Dave than he already was, Kevin booked a room in a  urlLink far swankier hotel  than  urlLink the one Dave was staying in . To add insult to injury, Dave then proceeded to invite so many friends that he was  two  people over the technical limit. Needless to say, this did not sit well with Kevin & friends.   Of course Dave has no idea that he is suchly despised. That would ruin all the fun.   So on Thursday, Kevin and his friends went to the shooting range in Vegas because apparently boys enjoy large firearms. To make the experience even more enjoyable, they blew up pictures of Dave so that they were poster-sized, choosing an especially unflattering picture with Dave in a mini fez, his mouth stuffed with food. And then they used these posters for target practice.  Then they each signed their "artwork," and presented them to Dave at dinner as his birthday present.   I don't know, if I received photos of me riddled though with bullets, I might not take too kindly to it. I might be hurt and madly insulted. Not Dave, however. He genuinely thought that these posters were the Best Birthday Presents he had received EVER. Even after Kevin pointed out that he shot Dave first through the head, then through the heart, "just in case the first one didn't [finish] him off." Even after Kevin and his friends said that this was the most fun they had had in ages. Even after Kevin and his friends said, "We hate you Dave, we really do." Maybe the desert heat addled Dave's thinking capabilities. It was all I could do to keep from openly gaping at Dave, because I just couldn't believe that he thought this was "truly awesome." But he did. And he wasn't even that drunk!  Perhaps you had to be there - but you can imagine it. What would you do if you were presented with three poster-sized pictures of yourself, bullet holes everywhere?   Kevin and I had a good laugh over it afterwards. But really, it's sad. Dave just had no idea.  (See - it's those 4-letter male names. Clueless and moronic.)

      Vegas in the summer is damn hot. No, that's not a big surprise. All those cement edifices, combined with tar and other manmade substances, soak up the heat and add to the already 100+ degree temperatures. So, really, the days were boring. They involved a lot of walking around, and darting into casinos every 5 minutes because it was hotter than Hades outside. And then going back outside because the casinos were freezing cold. Back and forth between hot and cold. I'm surprised I didn't get sick. There is also tons of shopping in Vegas. Lots of fake boobs too. And fat people who get fatter by alternating sitting on their asses gambling and eating at the buffets. And lots of lobster-red people sitting by the pool. Skin cancer ain't cool.   But really, the more interesting part are the guys we met. I would say people, but really, the only other people we really talked to were guys.    The desperate guy.  What, you think I remember names? Anyhow, we were at the  urlLink Foundation Room  at the  urlLink House of Blues  Friday night, which is their member-only section on the top floor (35th? 36th?) of Mandalay Bay. Yes, we're special. Yes, we know people. Or at least people who know people.   Anyhow. I might have been wearing something that exposed rather ample cleavage, which is a great guy magnet, especially in Vegas. To avoid talking to this guy who was only interested in talking to my chest, I started chatting up his friend.   Best line of the conversation? Out of the blue, he asks, "Do you have a kid?" Thankfully, I only replied with a surprised "No!" rather than the "Fuck, no!" that almost came out of my mouth, as this guy was 23, and had a 3 year old child.   That did not stop me from accepting his drinks, and perhaps dancing with him. He was cute and buying me booze. It wasn't going to go any further than that. But then I made the fatal mistake of giving him my real number when he asked for it, for when I'm put on the spot I just cannot lie, it's pathetic.   However, in the end I'm glad I gave him my number because I got to see just how desperate he was. FOUR phone calls Saturday - 2:30PM, 8PM, 10:30PM and 1:30AM. Obviously I didn't pick up and let him go straight into voicemail, where he repeated, "I said I was going to call so I'm calling so call me back" like 500 times. Sure, he said he was going to call, but I never said I was going to answer.    The banterer.  On the way back to our room after leaving the Foundation Room, we ran into a whole group of guys on our floor who were just leaving for the night. One was a slightly less-cute version of Ed Norton, and if I hadn't been so pooped I probably would have taken them up on their offer to join them out. But I had been drinking since 3PM, Katie had gone to work that day and then flown out, and it was 2:30AM and we were  tired . Thus, I felt no need to attempt to flirt with him, so instead had a lot of fun bantering instead which I am far better at because 1) I don't feel the need to pander to the male ego and 2) thus am blunt yet delightfully amusing. Unfortunately, this more natural tendency of mine tends to scare off guys in bars rather than attract them. Oh well. Their loss. Anyhow, this lasted for a good 20 minutes until I decided that I was too tired to keep it up, and so ended the exchange. I kept hoping for a 2nd wind to kick in there and was expecting that trading barbed comments would do it - remember, near-Ed Norton doppelganger - but alas, no.   The loser.  This wasn't one of the guys we met out, but rather another college friend's friend from medical school. Oh my God, I don't know how guys like him  ever  get dates. First of all, he didn't order anything for dinner because he had eaten four hours earlier and wasn't hungry. What? Not hungry? It also is just weird when you're in a large party of 12, the 9 other guys have ordered their  urlLink all-you-can-eat meat  dinners, the two girls have their entrees, everyone has fun rum drinks, and you have a sad lonely bottle of beer. Not that you should feel forced into ordering food when you're not hungry, but don't you plan in advance when you know you have dinner plans at a certain time? It also really doesn't help when you're socially awkward. For example:  Me: I'm hot. I'm going to take off my jacket.  [Takes off jacket]  Him: So you're hot? Can you say anything in response to that? Another variation of this is: Me: Hey, this mojito is good. Katie, you want a sip? Him: So your mojito is good? Maybe he was trying to make conversation, but Katie, Kevin and I (the three sitting closest to him) tried, but he was like a black hole of conversation - it just wasn't to be had. His statements were just conversation enders.  Me: Yeah, so we met these guys last night...  [Continues to recount story of loser guys who won't stop calling]  Katie: Yeah, the one I was talking to was just so socially inept. Him: What do you mean by socially inept? Me:  [Takes a big gulp of good mojito to prevent saying, "You are a prime example of socially inept."]  He also did not know what nor where Coney Island is, and he goes to school in NYC. To top it all off, he was unattractive. Not that I'm shallow. Okay, I sort of am. But if you're going to be just boring as all fuck to talk to and/or weird, at least please be good-looking so I have eye candy.    The bachelor party.  After dinner Saturday night, Katie and I went to  urlLink Ghostbar  which, being on the 55th floor of  urlLink The Palms , has the best view ever of Vegas.   There are tons of bachelorette parties in Vegas, easily distinguished from others by the veil and the various penis-shaped paraphernalia. Bachelor parties are less easily identifiable. But we got to talking to this group of relatively attractive, tall guys who were in town to celebrate their friend's last night of freedom. Too bad he was wandering around talking to his fianc&egrave;e on his cell all night. However, tall guys are really hard to talk to because you can't hear them when there's loud music in the background and when the people at the hotel decide to add to the ambiance by turning on the turbo fans outside to add "atmosphere," causing near pre-hurricane winds. Alas, such is life. But it's good to know that there are cute chiropractors out there. Too bad this group was from Seattle. I'll find ones closer to home.   ******  And so, that pretty much was it. Lots of drinking, lots of walking around. Not too much gambling - after losing $10 at blackjack, I figured I could better spend my money buying food and alcohol.  No, I did not meet anyone on my flight - but that might be because as soon as I put my seatbelt on, I fall asleep, which isn't terribly conducive to talking to your seatmates. Vegas is fun. For the weekend. It's like the Disney World of gambling. But any longer, and I think I'd go mad with the constant ringing of slot machines.

       urlLink Southwest Airline Passengers Find Love in Next Seat  Veteran Southwest flight attendant C.J. Deschaine has seen the sparks fly between couples hundreds of times -- especially on flights to Las Vegas. Please please let this be true. It would be swell! I generally  hate  Southwest - please, I like the comforts of my first class cabin and assigned seating - but, I could learn to love it if - gasp! - I actually met someone on the plane worth talking to. Who's cute. And if it turned into a weekend fling - well, all the better!     My friend Steph and I had this idea once where we were going to somehow combine flying and matchmaking. You know, fill out a little questionnaire and get seated in a row of compatible people. Not the worst way to spend a flight, making friends - beats jostling for the armrest with the fat businessman sitting next to you or watching whatever movie they're showing.     But it looks like it already happens on Southwest. (And according to the article, first class cabins are also conducive to romance in the air, but that is such a lie because all the times I've flown first class I always get seated next to a.. well, a fat businessman who I'm sure wonders why I drink so much. Hey, I'm not going to turn down free vodka. And flying is so boring, you might as well drink yourself to sleep.)     Anyway dahlings, I'm off to Vegas in a couple of hours, so cross your fingers for me. I'll even shower before the flight and maybe, ooh just maybe, dry my hair properly too, so it's not just a limp mass hanging on my head.     Even if it doesn't pan out - well hell. I'll be in Vegas. Katie's joining me.  urlLink Someone else  was supposed to come along also, but isn't gonna. Hrmph. And we're staying next door (quite literally, I called the  urlLink hotel  to make sure our rooms were next to each other) to  urlLink Kevin  and his brethren. There's no way I'll have a bad time, since Kevin and I will pimp each other out. I mean, that's what friends do.     And, there's always my return leg on Southwest.   And if  that  fails, well, perhaps a  urlLink trip to Alaska  should be in the works.     Hope springs eternal.

      Senior year of college, my friend Alissa and I came up with this "game" (and I use the term loosely) where we would determine what our friends'  real ages  were. Okay, it's hard explaining, so I will give some examples. It doesn't make as much sense if you don't know these people, I know, but you can get the general idea.   *Alison was one because she wanted to be carried around all the time. *Julie and Karina were 4, and they wore frilly party dresses with big fat ribbons in their hair. *Alissa was 5 so she could play in the dirt during recess. *Becca, who talked incessantly about sex, was 18 because... well, she couldn't be any younger. *Amanda, who hated it when we started playing this game, was 21, because she didn't understand the point since she was always too literal and because it annoyed her that she didn't get to be any younger, heehee.     Alissa and I could go on for ages talking about this. And no, we weren't drunk or high or in any other altered state of consciousness. I don't know, blame it on senior spring.    But I know that you're dying to know how old I was. Why, three! And very often, I do think that I am a 3-year-old. Here are some reasons why:  My most  favourite  foods (after confit de canard, of course) are chicken nuggets, french fries and macaroni and cheese. Even though I go to fancy-dancy restaurants all the time, you could place those three food items in front of me at any point and I'll find room for them in my stomach. I could eat these three things almost every day for the rest of my life and I'd be happy. Fat and on the quick road to heart failure, but happy.   Related to the above, one of my favourite indulgences is a 4-piece Chicken McNugget happy meal from McDonalds. The toy is the coolest ever. And I get my McNuggets and fries. But most of all, I get a new toy. I just got this awesome skateboarding one that does tricks. It's the best.   If I pout long enough, I always get what I want. This has always worked in the past.   I can get people to happily do things for me. Like washing my dishes. Or washing my laundry and folding it neatly and placing it in piles atop my bed. Or driving me around. Or making photocopies and sending faxes for me. Etcetc. And this isn't just with my parents, but extends to friends and people I work with. It must be because I bring out the caretaker in people. You know, like cute little children do.    I relate amazingly well to 3-year-olds. It's as if I were one of them.   Some of my favourite all-time shows are cartoons like the  Powerpuff Girls , the old school  Scooby Doo  cartoons (pre-Scrappy, of course) and the  Smurfs . Remember the Smurfs? Miss the Smurfs? If you do, be jealous - when I was little my father taped a whole bunch of shows for me, so now I can watch them anytime I want - which is usually when I'm hungover and all I want to do is lie in bed with a plate of scrambled eggs and watch cartoons.  Wow, if you didn't know me, you'd think I was an extremely spoiled only child. Or at least a younger child. But I'm not, I'm the eldest of two. It's all about living in the bubble of denial. That's how you keep this mentality.   So how old are you, and why?

      Obviously, something is not right.     For the first time in my life,  I actually miss the East coast .     I am an LA child born and bred. The only reason I went to the East coast for school was to get away from my overbearing family. Okay, there were other reasons, but that was the primary one. And while I was at school, I would extoll the many virtues of life in La-La Land, from the glorious weather to lack of bugs to the fact that you can potentially go skiing in the morning and be sunning on the beach in the afternoon. (No, I haven't done this, as I don't ski.) I would count down days until I could return home again.     Not to say that I'm not glad I live on the East coast. I never want to settle there. But being primarily located on the East coast for the last 6 years has made me appreciate home that much more.    So it comes as the biggest shock to me to realise that - ohmigod, for the first time ever, I actually want to be back there.    I'm not sure why. It's not that I've been overly drinking or baked my brain in the sun. Okay, I might have done both. But never have they elicited  this  startling response before.     So far, there are only three reasons I can tease out of my addled mind as to why I actually miss the East coast. Feel free to agree or disagree:     Public transportation is so damn convenient.   I think this really only applies to New York, because even in Boston I prefer to brave the crazy drivers rather than take public transportation. But in New York, well... public transport is the way to go.  Now don't get me wrong. I love my car. I love driving, as long as I'm not stuck in traffic and can race down the freeway at 90mph. Because LA is so spread out, you  have  to have a car, so I've grown up utterly dependent upon it, which is great and all - until you have to meet someone at a drinking establishment, where you know you'll get good and wasted. Then you're stuck with either severely limiting the amount you drink, or driving drunk. I admit it, I drove drunk in Providence and Boston plenty - but the streets are less crowded there, and odds are you won't have to get on the freeway or encounter lots of traffic. Not true in LA. Yes, there is this nifty little service where if you get drunk, you can call  urlLink these people  and they'll come get you and drive you home... but it's not the same.  You have to be responsible enough to call them. And you can't just hail down a taxi - it just doesn't work like that. You have to call a taxi service, and hope that the dispatchers are actually responsible and send you a cab. Plus, the city is so big and sometimes so crowded that it can take you $20 to go four measly miles, what with waiting in traffic and all.  And we're not even going to go into public transportation out here. It doesn't really exist. Perhaps I'm a bit of a snot, but I don't know anyone who actually takes the bus or the new metro lines. Why would you? You have a car, after all.   And nobody walks. Why? That's right, you have a car.   But New York. Ah, no need to worry about getting blitzed beyond control - you can just roll into any one of the numerous yellow taxis roaming around the city. Or if you're more coherent, $2 buys you a subway ride home. Or maybe you can - gasp! - walk, if it's not too far. Nobody has to be the designated driver - you can all drunkenly carouse together!  So yes, me, Miss OCD, misses riding with the plebians on subways and taking sometimes smelly taxis. (And it's because I'm an alcoholic.) See, like I said, I think something is seriously wrong.     Living on the East coast means I'm not living at home.   I never talk about my parents, because they drive me nuts. I'm sure they mean well, but the way they go about it is overbearing and just makes me want to bash my head against the wall. It was fine while I was dating fuckwit, since I was at his place half of the time, but now that I'm a freewheeling single, the only thing I want to do is go out and drink and make out with random guys in bars - well, living at home is not a very conducive atmosphere to doing so, because my mother always wants to know when I'm going to be home. "Sometime tonight," apparently doesn't cut it with her. The fact that people - her daughter being one of them gasp! - would actually go out and drink in public and do god knows what else just doesn't sit well with her.   Not to mention that home isn't in the best location for going out on the town, as we live in a very pretty suburb that is unfortunately a freeway's drive away from the bars I like to go to.   I'm not used to being accountable for my actions, having lived by myself for the last 3 years. And even when I had roommates, sure, I'd tell them where I was going if I wasn't going out with them, but it's not the same.   Yes, I could perhaps have found an apartment for the summer here, but it wasn't the best of ideas, seeing that I'm already paying rent on an apartment in Cambridge and that I'm only here for 3 months.   And I'm excited to move back to the East coast for once, to a new apartment in a new city where my parents aren't breathing down my back.   (But believe me, once I'm home for good - that's it. I'm moving out. Finding myself a cute apartment in West LA with  urlLink a great roommate , and I'm not giving my parents the spare set of keys.)     The LA scene sometimes gets too much for me.   If I see one more obviously fake tanned girl in a little flouncy miniskirt with a wifebeater, a newsboy cap, a skinny scarf wrapped around her neck even though it hits 80 degrees by 10AM, aviators and fuck-me stilettos - I will scream.   I don't think I have to go into any further explanation here.  (And yes, call me stupid for wanting to find more down-to-earth people in the vapid entertainment capital of the world. They exist. But even if not - please! Some individuality here wouldn't be amiss.)  I'm blaming this (better be) temporary delusional state on my enormous bug bites. I have been informed that one is actually a spider bite, while the rest are mosquito bites. Whatever insect bit me, I hate you. And hopefully the delirium will pass and I'll go back to scoffing at whatever meagre benefits the East coast has to offer over my lovely hometown.

      To all those mosquitos flying around, looking for fresh blood:    I know you like me. I don't know why, but I do know that you do. I've had multiple welts on my arms and legs as proof of this. Anytime I go anywhere vaguely tropical or hell, just humid (like the stupid South), you find me, and cover me with the most painful heat-radiating bites.     Most people get a mosquito bite, scratch at it a little and that's it. But that's not the case with me. One measly little bite, and for the next two weeks I'll have a nasty welt the size of Texas that emits - I swear - as much heat as the sun. And that's  without  my even scratching it. And did I mention that they bruise, without me touching them? Hell, that's just unattractive. But the scratching feels soooo good, even though I know that just makes it worse. The mere act of my skirt lightly brushing against your bites brings so much relief that I sometimes deliberately swish my skirts a little more just to get that light soothing rub.     And not only do these bites make me look like I'm carrying the plague, but they  hurt . They actually cause physical pain. For some reason, you like to go straight for my joints. That means just the mere act of walking, or just crossing my legs, hurts like never before. And the pain makes me woozy and light-headed - I swear all the blood in my body is being rerouted to fueling the furnaces of inflammation, which doesn't help my already poor incapacited brain that can only think about how much the bites hurt in the first place.     Nothing makes me feel better, aside from the temporary relief of scratching. There is no cream or ointment out there that brings me solace. Even sleep doesn't help, because I can't fall asleep at night because I want to scratch the welts so badly. It's just pure evil.     I understand that you are prevalent in Puerto Rico, and in your glee for my blood you bit my poor but thankfully tan legs until I swear, my legs weren't legs at all, just big welts. I understand that when I sat by the pool in Charlottesville, which is practically the wilderness, you just couldn't help a taste or two or five gazillion, again leaving my limbs all swollen. Thankfully, you have avoided my torso, for which I can't thank you enough. All I can say again is that luckily, I was tan, so the redness was less apparent against my darkened skin. In Madison, you must be super-mosquitos, because it only took two bites to make my entire lower leg red (as opposed to the 6 it usually takes). And I wasn't even tan so the reaction was even more startling. I almost had to go to the emergency room because fuckwit's parents had never seen such a virulent reaction to mosquito bites.    But now I'm home in Los Angeles, not some tropical or godforsaken locale. And so I plead with you to leave me alone. There aren't supposed to be mosquitos in Los Angeles. I thought that all the heat and smog and pollution killed you off. It's not even humid here, and I'm not near any stagnant pools of water! And there is certainly no wilderness here, at least not where I go. For 23 years, I have remained bite-free in LA. But things have changed. Somehow, a few strong ones of you have survived, and found me Saturday evening when I was barbecuing with friends. I could barely enjoy my nice juicy steak and grilled zucchini as I was bemoaning the fact that I had again been bitten. And apparently the bites don't like the attention taken away from them, as while I was at the Hollywood Bowl, all I could do was rather inelegantly rub at your bites while trying to be classy and watch the  urlLink ballet  and the cool fireworks.      There are a ton of people out there. Please leave me alone and go bother them. Go bite someone who won't have such adverse reactions. Sure, it might not be as fun, but haven't you had enough fun at my expense already?    Thank you for your time and consideration.     Sincerely yours,  Me.

      Okay, so apparently Kevin and Bean were wrong. Or hopefully Ted Casablancas is wrong. Because the latter reports that Michael Vartan and Jennifer Garner  urlLink MIGHT BE GETTING MARRIED . What the hell. It's only been 24 hours, and my hopes are already cruelly dashed. But she is in Canada right now. That gives me some time to make him see the light...  Anyhow. It is now less than a month until Brooke and Mark's wedding.  As a result,  all  Brooke talks about are her impending nuptials.     Wait, nothing's changed. This is all she's been talking about since April 2003, when he proposed. But it's gotten so much worse of late. Everything she does now is related to her wedding (whereas before boring tidbits about Mark were thrown in). All topics of conversation can be brought back to her wedding. For example: Her: I just had lunch, but I'm still hungry :( Me: What did you have? Her: Boring food. A turkey sandwich, an apple and a granola bar. Me: I'm going to have a panini. Her: Ooooh that sounds good :) Me: Life's too short to eat boring food. Her: Well, I have to be on a super-strict diet so I can fit into my wedding dress. It's a little tight and I don't want to risk anything. Me: Well, if the dress was made to fit you, why is it tight? Her: Because that's just the way it is. I'm sorry, my wedding dress is going to be comfortable. No reason I have to starve myself eating "boring food" to fit into a dress that's still too tight for me. She also works out  obsessively  (going to the gym for 2 hours every day) as part of her wedding diet (yet somehow, does not look toned at all. Skinny, yes. Toned, no). Please note, however, that we started out talking about food, but ended up talking about her wedding. Another example: Her: I'm bored. Me: Me too.   Her: I think I'm going to add more things to the registries. What the hell? Do we need another example? I think so! Her: What are your plans this weekend?  Me: Beach, alcohol, BBQ, Hollywood Bowl, more alcohol. Hopefully some shopping too.   Her: Sounds like fun. Wanna trade? :)  Me: Why, what are your plans? Her: Shopping for wedding-related stuff. Her: Pretty much from here on out, it's all wedding-related stuff :) Me: Yeah, I noticed.   [An astute person would note here to Shut Up Already about wedding-related stuff. Not Brooke. She thinks that we're all as interested as she is.]  Her: Yeah, there are so many little things to do and details to take care of. You'd think it'd be easy once the big stuff is out of the way, but no. I have to go...  [and this is where I started tuning out because really I didn't care anymore]    It also doesn't help that she has absolutely no friends in Boston. Zero. None. Personne. How can someone live in one place for 2 years and not have any friends? Oh, that's right, she has Mark. Unfortunately, Mark is currently in LA, and she is left in Boston with nobody.   I feel bad that I feel like this, because I  am  a bridesmaid, and I understand for her this is  the  Most Important Day in her young life - but ARGH I have better things to do with my time. Like mentally decorating and redecorating the apartment I'm getting here when I finally move back for good. But this is all Brooke talks about - and believe me, she is so bored at work that she wants to talk all the time and I'm the only friend she has on IM. And then, as a result, *I* end up only talking about Brooke's wedding because I'm complaining over how much time it takes and how it's all she talks about!  As  urlLink Scarlett  astutely pointed out, Brooke could start talking about the Middle East and end up relating it to her wedding.   But this raises the very valid question - what's Brooke going to talk about  after  she's married? I mean, this has consumed her since well, 5.5 years ago, the winter of our freshman year in college, when she asked me if I'd be her bridesmaid. (Remember, Mark only proposed last April.) Babies? Ohmigod if she starts talking babies, that's it, our friendship is so officially over.

      I was going to post an APB for  urlLink Michael Vartan , as I heard yesterday on  urlLink Kevin and Bean  (the  best  morning radio talk show ever) that he and Jennifer Garner are no longer. He is my ideal guy, I swear. 6' tall, part-French, fluent in French, hot, and more than 5 years older than me (as I have moved onto older guys now. But not too old, mind you).  Anyway, my plan is to hunt him down, as he does live in LA and go out here, and convince him that I am  the  woman for him. So if anyone sees him, tell him that there is a perfectly cute girl just  perfect  for him - and eons better than Jennifer Garner, who tries way too hard to be cutesy when she really looks like her face got squished in the doors of an elevator.  ANYHOW. Like always, I digress. In an effort to be more cultured and civilised and whatnot, my theatre-going buddy Katie and I went to see  urlLink  Thoroughly Modern Millie   at the  urlLink Ahmanson Theatre  in downtown LA on Tuesday.   Now, I like my musicals to be  musicals  - lush, overdone, big synchronised song-and-dance numbers. Preferably with a cheesy and predictable storyline - you know, a love interest gone awry but of course they find each other - with a big fat happy ending. One big sappy song about love is always good. Some humour, too. And did I mention the song-and-dance? If you can even incorporate some tap in there, I'll be in heaven. On my 'yay' list:  Kiss Me, Kate ,  Chicago ,  Wicked  (okay, no tap and there's not really a love story, but it was so good anyway). On my 'eh' list:  Les Mis&eacute;rables ,  Miss Saigon  (I do not like tragedy of any sort),  The Lion King  (the amazing costumes made it worthy),  Cabaret . On my 'ew' list:  Rent ,  Tommy . I know that I've seen more musicals, but I can't remember them all now.   Which category did  Thoroughly Modern Millie  fall into? Resoundingly, the first one. With bells and whistles. It had the great cheesy storyline. It had my tap dancing! It was horribly un-PC (I am not an advocate of political correctness as I think that it's often taken way overboard)!  The story is quite simple. A young girl - Millie - from Kansas moves to New York in the 1920s (I love the 20s, if there's an era I'd like to return to it'd be the 1920s. Or the 1960s, for the Mod fashion), hellbent on being a "modern" woman and finding herself a rich husband. There is a second storyline - young girls - of Millie's age - are disappearing all over the city, rumoured to having been sold into white slavery in the Orient.   You can guess the rest. Millie thinks she finds herself a rich husband, but instead falls in love with the poor guy (who turns out to be rich, of course) who had insulted her on her very first day in New York. The proprietor of the ladies' hotel Millie stays in is indeed the part of this white slavery chain, abducting orphans from her hotel and selling them off. It could potentially be deeply offensive, the very clich&eacute;d manner in which Chinese people are portrayed - and maybe I am a horrible person but it was very very funny. Millie's best friend falls in puppy love with Millie's boss, only to later fall in love with one of her potential Chinese abductors. There are more little twists I won't share, I can't completely spoil it.  And there is some tap. There are some big synchronised numbers. There's even that one great song (okay, maybe only great in my head) entitled "Gimme Gimme", here are some of the lyrics: A simple choice, nothing more This or that, either or Marry well, social whirl, business man, clever girl Or pin my future on a green glass love What kind of life am I dreaming of?  I say gimme, gimme ... gimme, gimme Gimme, gimme that thing called love I want it Gimme, gimme that thing called love I need it Highs and lows, tears and laughter Gimme happy ever after Gimme, gimme that thing called love ....  Gimme, gimme that thing called love I want it Here I am, St. Valentine My bags are packed, I'm first in line Aphrodite, don't forget me Romeo and Juliet me Fly, dove! Sing, sparrow! Gimme fat boy's famous arrow Gimme, gimme that thing called love! (I will be deeply offended if you think I liked that song due to its title alone, which reeks of selfishness and material greediness if you don't know the lyrics to the song.)  And for those of you who need the validation of awards before you'll drag yourself off your asses and shell out a pretty penny for theatre tickets -  Thoroughly Modern Millie  won six Tonys in 2002, including Best Musical. So there! You don't have an excuse anymore!   Unfortunately, it closed last month on Broadway. Fortunately, this is only the beginning leg of its tour, and I highly recommend that all run out and see it.   (And if you happen to see Michael Vartan out and about, club him over the head and bring him to me. I will forever be in your debt.)

             urlLink            urlLink            urlLink            urlLink            urlLink     Je m'ai rendue compte ce matin que malheureusement, je n'ai aucune bonne photo de Paris et de la France, en particuli&egrave;rement de la Tour Eiffel, qu'est le plus fameux monument fran&ccedil;ais. Et j'ai habit&egrave;e pr&eacute;s de la Bastille mais &egrave;galement je n'ai aucune photo de &ccedil;a. Tant pis. Donc, je vous laisse avec cettes photos de la France que j'ai trouv&eacute;e sur mon ordinateur ce matin. De haut en bas: la Seine de l'&Icirc;le-St-Louis, la plage &agrave; Nice, les jardins Luxembourg &agrave; Paris, une publicit&eacute; ridicule que j'ai vue dans le M&egrave;tro pour oui, les chaussettes et ma rue pr&egrave;f&egrave;r&egrave;e &agrave; Paris.  While  urlLink Bastille Day  commemorates the storming of the Bastille (14 july 1789), the main monument associated with that location there does  not . It actually marks a different event.  urlLink La Colonne de juillet  - the column in the centre of the place - actually commemorates the  urlLink July revolution of 1830 , les Trois Glorieuses, July 27-30, the three glorious days, after which Charles X - who had tried to restore France to the days of absolutism, pre-democratic government - was forced to abdicate and the throne went to Louis-Philippe, who agreed to rule under a constitutional monarchy.  So yes, while Bastille Day celebrates the events of 1789 - it is rather interesting that the column there, which people generally first picture when they think of the Place de la Bastille, actually celebrates a  much later  revolution. It is because the French government could not erect a monument celebrating the storming of the Bastille and by extension the French Revolution, a shameful time in French history for the government, so they instead built a monument that celebrated the establishment of a constitutional monarchy which was much more palatable. I'm not sure I'm explaining this well; I wrote an entire essay about forgetting and the French consciousness, about how monuments erected in Paris actually don't honour of what people assume they honour, but this was ages ago. You get the jist of it though - rewriting history so that it doesn't make you look as bad. Everybody does it - governments just have the money to build big monuments to aid in the revision. And it did include braving the traffic around the Colonne de jullet to get close enough to actually see the monument up close. If anyone has seen those crazy round-abouts in Paris, s/he will know how I nearly lost my life in this endeavour because just like Boston drivers, Parisian drivers ignore pedestrians completely.   Actually, that would make a really good thesis topic, forgetting and the French consciousness, if it hasn't already been done (which I'm sure it has). But ooh. It's not too late for me though to switch career plans and return to French. At least I have the undergraduate credentials for it, unlike this stupid education degree where I am going to have to take math again for the first time in eight years. Then again, a PhD in French will get me even fewer places. Oh well.  And this brief history lesson (and digression) is concluded. Go out and have some sorbet Berthillon or a crepe or confit de canard to celebrate today.

      I have a friend, Stan, who drives a pickup. He'd always try to get my attention by whistling at me from behind the wheel of his car when he passed me walking down the street. Naturally, being a girl used to the boorish ways of men, I'd ignore him - because  never ever  look at someone catcalling you unless you plan to insult them - and he'd get offended, then yell at me for ignoring him. "Stan, you moron, I'm not going to acknowledge you if you whistle at me," I'd explain patiently. He never got it. I think it's because he's an Italian from Long Island. Not that there's anything wrong with being an Italian from Long Island. It just explained so much though.  But what is it with men thinking that they can whistle at you, leer, ogle shamelessly, mutter remarks under their breaths about your appearance, roll down their car windows and stick their stupid heads out to look back at you.. so on, and so forth.   I don't know why, but I've especially noticed it of late. Maybe I'm more sensitive to it now, or maybe it just happens more. I have no idea. But it just makes me want to chuck a large heavy object - or whatever I'm holding - at the offender. For crying out loud, the other day I was walking back to work from the drugstore, when an SUV of guys in their mid-20s  all  very overtly stared at me, some even rolling down the car windows and sticking nearly their entire torsos out of the car to watch me as they drove away. Sure, I'm cute enough, but I'll be the first to admit that I'm nowhere even in the same league as Gisele Bundchen or some other hot supermodel/actress.   It's vaguely flattering, but somehow deeply offensive at the same time. Flattering because it's nice to know that you're attractive. Offensive because you just feel like a piece of meat.   And sure, women check out men all the time. But I bet that the percentage of women who engage in overt  expressions are far fewer (except perhaps in bars or when there's alcohol involved. All bets are off when alcohol is involved).   A large problem is that I have this tendency to make eye contact with people whenever I pass by them. I'm not sure why I do this - I've been told it's a very European thing? - but really, I need to stop doing this - or at least buy sunglasses with even darker lenses. Stupid American men think that I'm making a pass at them if I look them in the eye. Sometimes, I feel like telling them that no, you're nobody special just because I'm making eye contact, that it's habit, that I want to make sure you're not completely crazy justincase. But you know, the opportunity never really presents itself. That, and I don't talk to strangers.   But it's just galling. I shoudln't have to feel self-conscious walking around. I shouldn't have to feel like I should be wearing a cardigan in 100 degree heat just to cover my shoulders and chest because I'm wearing a strappy top that reveals some cleavage. I'm wearing the top because it's so damn hot, not because I'm trying to attract attention. I shouldn't have to scurry past construction sites because I feel uncomfortable with multiple pairs of eyes staring at me. I should be able to make eye contact with people and have them assume that it's just an acknowledgement of their presence, rather than anything more.   I suppose it is rather flattering that I'm not found utterly repugnant by the male population. But the portion of the male population that indulges in such actions of crassness are repugnant to me. What girl wants a loutish boor? Nobody I know. And the next guy who stares will either get the finger, or some nasty comment, because I am fed up to  here  with it all.

       urlLink     Picture borrowed from  urlLink Hollywoodusa.co.uk  . More pictures  urlLink here .  The  urlLink Hollywood Bowl  is definitely an LA institution. It's the summer home of the LA Philharmonic - but oh, it's so much more than that. From late June through late September, it is home to nightly shows that range from classical music to dance to.. well, there's a wide spectrum of stuff it covers. And, it's also known for nightly clogging up the Highland entrance to the Hollywood freeway, making the already-bad LA traffic an even bigger incomprehensible snarl Every Single Night of the week for 3 months.   But it's a great venue for a summer evening. Pack a picnic (and make sure to include a bottle of wine!) and drive on up, and be treated to an outdoor concert. Nestled in the foothills of the Santa Monica mountains, it's a lovely outdoor amphitheatre, with seats way up in the bleacher going for as cheap as $1, to highly coveted box seats that are impossible to score. Me, I aim for the mid-level bench seats, as often it's never sold out and then you can spread out your dinner. Plus, you can talk in the benches, which is good for me because I can never stay quiet for too long, I have this irrepressable need to add vocal commentary to everything.   I love the Hollywood Bowl. Not the classical performances, to be honest - I'm not quite that cultured yet, as I need more excitement than that to keep me focused. But while I was still dating fuckwit, it took an arm and a leg to get him to come along to concerts (and other such cultural affairs, such as visiting museums. Taking him to a museum was like dragging a 5-year-old along. Actually, a 5yo might even be better behaved. He did it because it was "good for him", not because he actually wanted to. Plus, you could only convince fuckwit to participate in such affairs if they were well-reviewed and well-publicised, which I thought was a lousy way to approach matters. "Let's see  urlLink Avenue Q ," I said once, before it became really well-known. "You want to watch a puppet show?" he asked, but after it won its 3 Tonys, his tune totally changed. That was always a problem with him, even eating out. He lived and died by Zagat's, which true, provides a good benchmark but is sometimes unreliable. Experience it for yourself and then draw your own conclusion, I say), and so not many tickets were bought. But now that he's out of the picture, I have all this free time not taken up by seeing him, and so have recruited my friend Katie as my Sunday Hollywood Bowl partner. The Sunday performances are usually more interesting, in my opinion - fewer classical stuff - plus it's a nice relaxing way to end the weekend. And I get to discover all sorts of new music, which is always a plus in my book.  The one show that fuckwit did get dragged to was  urlLink Brazil Night , which featured  urlLink Da&uacute;de  (which we unfortunately missed, but I've heard some of her stuff since and it's good),  urlLink Margareth Menezes  and  urlLink Jorge Ben Jor . If I had to recommend one, it would hands-down be Margareth Menezes (go  urlLink here  for audio clips). Admittedly, I don't know much about Brasilian music (okay, nothing), but I do know what I like, and she was very catchy and a great performer and had people standing up and dancing in the aisles.  Last night was  urlLink Global Divas , which featured  urlLink Tania Libertad ,  urlLink Oumou Sangar&eacute;  and  urlLink Tracy Chapman . I'd never heard of Oumou Sangar&eacute; before - she's from Mali - but again, another absolutely amazing performance. Like Margareth Menezes, she had people dancing in the aisles. And Tracy Chapman is always enjoyable - what an absolutely lovely voice - even if she lost me somewhat when she did a cover of a Nirvana song, but she re-won me back by following that with "Fast Car."   Coming up? The  urlLink Joffrey Ballet performing  The Nutcracker   and  urlLink  Mame  . The latter, in case you didn't know, is based on the book,  urlLink  Auntie Mame  , by Patrick Dennis. It is an absolutely hysterical book, the story of this loopy free-spirited  grande dame  who's suddenly guardian for her young nephew. It was also made into a play, musical (both on Broadway and on  urlLink film ) and  urlLink movie . If you're looking for a summer beach read, I highly recommend this one. Need more to convince you? Here are some quotes: Auntie Mame: Run along to Ito and tell him to bring me a light breakfast - black coffee and a side car. Oh, oh. And a cold towel for your Auntie Vera. Patrick Dennis: Is she in the guest room again? Auntie Mame: Since Sunday, dear. Now run along to Ito and hurry my tray, darling. Your Auntie needs fuel.   Auntie Mame: Oh, Agnes! Here you've been taking my dictations for weeks and you haven't gotten the message of my book: live! Agnes Gooch: Live? Auntie Mame: Yes! Live! Life's a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death! And if you are in the LA area this summer, or any summer, grab some food (I like  urlLink here , as it's nearby and doesn't close 'til 6PM on Sundays) and stop by the Hollywood Bowl (I promise I'm not shilling for them!) and add some culture to your life. It's not a large investment, and it's such an  experience  not to be missed.

      Okay. Enough about the fuckwit. It's been a week. I can stop talking about him. I'm driving myself mad. Besides, I think it's high time to exercise that  urlLink wonderful notion  put forth by  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  and practice some forgetting (forgetting, since I'm not about to get a lobotomy anytime soon). Besides, my kindergarten teacher first noted it when I was the tender age of five - I have this marvelous ability to quickly forget unpleasantries. My father says it's a sign of someone too into denial, that it's not healthy and that if I choose to forget, I'll never learn anything and just repeat history; I say it's a great form of self-preservation and far better than dwelling. So all his information has been erased from my cellular, its SIM card, my palm and my laptop and I've sent an email off to my roommate in Cambridge asking him to remove all offending photos from their frames and albums (I am nothing if not thorough) - thus let the forgetting begin. (And many thanks for the kind thoughts, and words of support. I'd also like to direct everyone's attention to the  urlLink virtual voodoo doll . There are great sound effects.  And  you can email your pin-studded voodoo doll to whomever you wish. It is oddly satisfying. Whee!)  Of course, that leads me with a dearth of things to post about. Here are things I considered, but couldn't develop any into a full post without being overly repetitive:  Posting pictures of my dog, Yuki, a very lazy and (I think) depressed akita. What the hell. Here's a baby picture of her, taken 7 years ago. She is much bigger now.   urlLink       Posting pictures of my tan line, to make everyone jealous. If there is one thing in life I work really hard at, and am never willing to procrastinate on, it's my tan. What does that make me? Shallow? Nooo.. but it warms my heart to know that I'm dedicated to  something , at least.    Contemplating whether or not it would still be okay to email fuckwit's mom for career advice. Really, I liked his family a lot. One of the hardest parts of this breakup is that I won't get to talk to/see them any longer. His father is a riot, his sister a sweetheart and his mother - well, mothers are always intimidating, but she was always so nice. Also, she's rather well-known in my future field of study, and she'd been such a help so far helping me figure out what I want to do and getting me in touch with the right people that it's a shame that I'd lose her even though I'm not dating him any longer. Did I mention that I hope they tell him he's being an absolute moron? Ah, it'd be nice. Good thing we didn't share friends, except for his roommate, whom I'll email when we're both back in Cambridge.    Writing the latest update on Brooke's wedding, but thinking of it gives me a headache. Suffice it to say that on top of paying for the dress, alterations, appropriate supportive undergarments, shoes, bachelorette party (which true, was mostly paid for by Katie's parents, thankfully)  and with expected expenses of the bridal shower, bridal shower present, wedding present and a visit to the salon for the requisite mani/pedi and updo, the maid of honor thinks that we should buy Brooke a bridesmaid's luncheon present. Why? I've already spent so much money on this wedding; I'd like to have some left to myself so that I can go on (okay, dream about) my  urlLink expensive   urlLink handbag   urlLink binge . (Given my recent budget, I'd probably have to settle for  urlLink this  or  urlLink this ,  which isn't too shabby either.)   Posting the email I got from  urlLink cute British guy , which basically affirms the fact that a year later, he still has a crush on me. Good to know I've still got it. (Ooh, just wait 'til  urlLink Nick  and shithead find out I'm single again. That'll be great for the ego.) Too bad I want his younger brother, who just finished his JD/MBA and is smokin' hot AND lives in New York City. However, I don't quite know how to broach  that  particular subject.  I'm sorry if I'm suddenly boring again. But one can only take so much drama. Give me a couple of weeks or so. I'm sure I'll come up with something by then. After all, I  am  off to  urlLink Vegas  in fifteen days, where Kevin has said he can't wait to "see [me] slut it up some," as apparently my last two years dating fuckwit hadn't resulted in any fun and crazy stories for Kevin. Go Kevin! Always knows what to say to make a girl feel good.

      I didn't expect a response so soon, but get one I did.   Not by phone, which surprised me - he was always one to confront verbally. No, it was short, and by email.  And it wished me well, and that every moment around me was as happy as it had seemed to be, and that the decision was hard. The breakup wasn't planned, but... still.   It happened, didn't it? And I would desperately love to know what made him change his mind so quickly, where Tuesday night we were talking about weekend plans and on Wednesday we weren't even a couple anymore.  I don't even know what I was expecting, for that matter. What kind of response. But I don't think it was that. There was no answers, truly, to anything I had brought up. He had already made his decision, and nothing I could have said or done would have changed anything. Not that I necessarily needed him to realise the error of his ways and come crawling back (although that would have been nice), but I expected more closure than  that .  It brought to mind a college rejection letter, the very cursory, "Thank you for your application, you were a great candidate, it was a difficult decision but we're sorry we couldn't offer you a spot in our incoming class" type of deal.  While I'm glad I said what I did - it would have bothered me horrendously if I didn't get what I wanted to say out - I still didn't expect it to sting so much.   And it still bothers me somewhat, it's  Just Not Fair  that he's probably already moved on, while I'm still in his horrid mopey state. All I can hope, however, is that even though he didn't tell me, that my words made him pause and think.   Mais alors, c'est la vie. I went with my gut, which I've always done. It's all for the best, in the end.

      Okay, this post was originially going to be titled, "Things I Need to Remember to Say to Fuckwit When He Calls," but then I decided to email my thoughts instead, because even though he said he'll call (and I know that he will), I really didn't want to wait until that unknown date, and be taken off-guard (again). Also, I'm far better with the written word than the oral. And finally, you know that feeling when you’re so hungover that you have two options: to puke and get the misery overwith, or to just sit and hope that the feeling passes? It's definitely the former situation right now.  So after the wonderful weekend sitting (okay, drinking) on the beach ("It's 4 o'clock. Who wants a cocktail?" "I'm already on my second one!" "Who's cooking?" "Doesn't matter, who's the most sober?" Oh yeah - my new favourite cocktail is a variation on the orange blossom martini - 1.5 shots of gin, juice from 1/2 orange, 1.5 tsp sugar, all shaken together and strained into a glass filled with ice), deepening my tan two further hues and nearly getting killed by the neighbours whose very illegal fireworks got out of control and exploded so close to us that they scorched Katie's father's glasses  while he was wearing them , these are the choice bits from the letter I sent him. Because it's good to remember what I wrote.    The spark is indeed a beautiful and glorious thing. However, at the same time, there is no way it can ever continue in perpetuity. It’s impossible to expect the spark to last forever is something a 12-year-old girl, imagining a “grown-up relationship”, dreams of. If it does last forever, then there’s something wrong with the relationship, that you’re not comfortable enough with the other person to show your true colours, to lounge around him/her in sweats, burping and drinking wine out of a rocks glass instead of a proper stem... The glow doesn’t mean you’re settling, by the way. We should all find the glow. The glow is what makes you happy to see the other person at the end of a long hard day. It’s what makes the fights tolerable. It’s spending the entire day with one another, without the need of scheduled activities in order to be happy. It’s what makes relationships last, what gives them staying power.    You know right away if the spark is there or not. And then you make the decision of whether it’s worth it to continue dating or not. It doesn’t take 2 years to figure it out. And if this spark was so goshdarned important to you all along, and you dragged out this relationship for 2 years – why? If you knew from the beginning that you needed this spark to make things work, then there is no bloody reason we should have been dating at all. You could have told me at any point that it wasn’t working for you, but you didn’t until last week. And that means you lied. For twenty-four months, you lied through your teeth to me, with such facility that I didn’t even know you had these doubts.    To be quite honest, I’ve felt the spark before, but not with you. It wasn’t a sudden  coup de foudre , as it was with others, that bolt of lightning, that feeling of butterflies in your stomach when you first meet someone new and you just  know  that something is going to happen. No, it wasn’t like that with you in the beginning at all. Or at any point that summer in New York. And if you had asked me at the end of that summer how I felt, I would have attributed to you the title of “perfect summer fling”, a great 8 weeks without commitment, ties or expectations. Then that next summer... we started dating again. I didn’t know what to think at the beginning. Or at the end of the summer, for that matter. Or for any of the following months after that... but after 8 months, a year... we were still dating. And one day, I don’t remember when, I realised that I felt this glow. That perhaps it hadn’t started out with sparkling fireworks, but there was something which I deemed far more important and lasting. And it made me happy, it quieted most of the questions and doubts that I had.    You say that you should  always  want to hang out with the person you're dating. Just plain stupid. Do you want to have no life of your own? Hell, I didn't want to hang out with you all the time while we were dating; I valued my time alone and my time with other friends. Co-dependency is not cool. Having separate yet joined lives is.    Compromise is not the same as sacrifice. Until you understand this difference, things are  never  going to change. Compromise is when I flew down to visit you even though you were too busy to reciprocate, because I cared. Sacrifice would have been my applying to grad school in DC/Cville just to be close to you. Believe me, I considered it, but realised I couldn't give up the chance of going to school in NY or Boston, even for you. All my actions over the past two years were those of compromise, not of sacrifice. Besides, I could never want the person I'm dating to think he's sacricifing himself for me. That just smacks of a character weakness I could do without.   Upon his receiving and reading this letter, my friend Kate vocalised my thoughts the best, "It's like a train wreck - he's going to want to stop reading it but he can't, and I hope that the miserable fucker gets it at work and cries his eyes out, leaving everyone at work to think that he's deranged and maybe needs psychiatric help." We can all hope that.   What I wanted to write, but didn't? "If you claimed you felt the spark with girls you've dated in the past - why aren't you still dating them. Why? Right, that's what I thought. The spark bullshit is just a lameass way to say 'I have commitment issues'." I mean, I think it's definitely a valid statement... but yeah, I decided not to bring it up. I show admirable restraint, if I do say so myself.  Petty revenge  would  have been so much more fun, and people had such good ideas. But I'm trying (really really hard) to be mature. More boring, perhaps, and if I were psycho there'd be fun stuff to read... but alas, that's me. Always trying to be the better person.   After I sent that off, gosh, you have no idea how much better I felt. So, if anyone knows of any cheap tickets from LA to Paris for the next month (cheap, like under $800, not the $1200 they currently are), that would be really really cool.   (And yes, the title of this post is the same as the subject on the email I sent him. Wasting my creativity on the fuckwit, sigh.)

      Did I mention that the beach house has wireless internet access? Ah, yes. I never have to be away from the computer, even while I'm sunning myself.  Anyway, I know that while my breakup isn't that interesting to other people, it (for obvious reasons) is the primary thing on my mind. Gah. I'm even annoying myself. But, I've given myself one week to freely complain, and then after that it'll only be every once in awhile.  The worst time of day for me is early morning, when I wake up and realise that oh, wait, I don't ever get to wake up next to fuckwit again. And as much as I hate to admit it, it hurts, and makes me feel somewhat hollow inside.  But throughout the rest of the day, I get to fume and ponder, ponder and fume. So I generally get over that initial moroseness and move on to being mad. Mad that he's being so immature. Mad that I didn't pick up on it earlier. Mad that I'm this mad. And while I know that it's more mature to take the moral high ground and move onwards to greater and better men, there is this little devious petty streak in me that wants to take revenge. Really really badly. I even googled "breakup, revenge" to see what was out there on the worldwideweb. Yeah, they all said that the best revenge was to move on, improve oneself, blahblahblah.   But That's No Fun At All. Petty revenge, while not advisable, is at least temporarily satisfying. So I've been indulging in some fantasies, and these are some of the things I've come up with. No, I'm actually (mostly) sane and I won't follow through on any of them. But it's fun imagining them happening anyway. My current favourite is the second one.   Signing him up, both on email and regular mail, to a bunch of spam lists, so that he gets  tons  of junk mail.  This one is rather lame, yes. But it is annoying. And annoying is fun, sometimes. But I couldn't really find anywhere online to sign him up! True, I didn't look that hard, I'm lazy. But people usually try to get off spam lists, not on them. Sigh. Along the same lines was submitting his cellphone number to a telemarketer list.    Having a hooker show up on his doorstep.   This one would just be damn funny. I'd pay good money for his roommate to videotape his reaction, too. And even if he didn't sleep with her (which ew, I hope he wouldn't), he'd still have to pay her. I'd make sure to get a high-class escort. Only the best. Or wait, she could show up at his work. But he'd know it was me behind it all, dammit.    Having Katie's father tell all the partners he knows at law firms not to hire the fuckwit.  This one only flittered across my brain for a second. Even I know that this isn't fair and it's just  wrong  to screw with someone else's career. But that didn't stop me from imagining it for that split second.    Replacing his precious Propecia with some other drug that has bad effects, like giving you horrible acne, diarrhea or huge man-boobs. Or best yet, one that would make you allergic to alcohol or the sun, or both.  This one would also be funny, since he is so scared of becoming bald. So he'd lose his hair,  and  something else horrible (but not life-threatening) would happen to him! A double whammy! Too bad my relatives who are pharmacists aren't  his  pharmacist. It would have rocked.    Signing him up on a dating website.  Yeah, this is sort of similar to the first. But since I'd be creating the profile, ooh la la, I could make as  creative  as I wanted. And I have lots of imagination.  And  I'd have the password to the account, not him. Then again, he would so know it was me.   Yes, I know that the  ultimate  revenge is be to fully get over him, become yet more desirable and start dating someone hotter, richer and smarter, who wasn't afraid of commitment and knew that that whole "I need a perpetual spark" bullshit is a 12-year-old girl's fantasy. But until that day comes or I'm not bitter anymore or I'm past this week, I'll just keep on imagining these fun scenarios. Suggestions are welcome.

       urlLink    Moping is bad. Too bad I'm so good at it. But in an effort to help the healing process, this is where I'll be for the weekend. That's right, back to Katie's beach house. Which is what original plans were, anyway. We'll get drunk with her father; that's always fun. He always has some new cocktail he wants to try on us. And yes, I'm petty. I hope that fuckwit (crankypants's new name) has a miserable weekend, as he was supposed to join us. Because really, nothing can beat the resort that is Katie's beach house, especially when her father is there and takes care of us.   Happy 4th of July!          urlLink              urlLink              urlLink              urlLink

      Really, if you're going to break up with someone, you might think that the kindest thing is to feed her first, then spring the news on her. So then she's full, and stuff.   But you know what? That's a really lousy way of doing it. Be a man, and come out with it at the beginning. Don't lull her into a sense of security, even though she might have earlier had the nagging feeling that something was wrong. Don't share your dinners like you always do and talk about future plans, like the hat she's going to make you, like nothing's wrong. Because that's actually just mean. And then to encourage her to take a red velvet cake home for later, knowing all the while that  the talk  is forthcoming? Really, really, really mean.   She's not gonna want the dessert to eat later. She's just going to want to smash it all over your precious vintage shirts and carefully waxed body board.  And those words, "I know it must come as a shock; I've had a month to think about it but I'm just springing it on you now"? They  don't  make it any better. But they do do a great deal to get her past any potential tears and just raging mad. And you're gonna want to hide the cake at that point.    ***  Moral of the story: When choosing between two guys to date,  always  choose the one closest to you distance-wise. Because then when the walls come tumbling down, you won't have spent so much on airfare.    Addendum: I didn't really do anything with the cake. Although I am not one to waste food, in this case I felt that it was better warranted that I just left behind. Though, it would have been great if I was one for public scees and threw it at him. It would have been worth it.

      What has the world come to, when my 18-year-old sister  cannot  be persuaded to see either  urlLink  Spider-Man 2   (Hello!!! James Franco!!!) OR  urlLink  The Bourne Supremacy   (Hello!!! Matt Damon!!!) BUT can be convinced to see  urlLink  The Manchurian Candidate  .   I mean, this is the girl who worships at the temple that is Justin Timberlake and all things pop culture/teeny-boppish. I thought it would be a  cinch  to convince her to see the first two movies. But no, about Spider-Man she said, "It looks like a stupid story, we already know the good guy can't die," and regarding Bourne she proclaimed, "I could barely get past the first one." Yet about Manchurian - a political movie, and this coming from the girl who, like the NYPost, thought that Gephardt was going to be the Dem's nominee for VP - she said, "That looks interesting."  "Do you know what it's even about?" I asked her, suspicious.  "No, but it looks good," she replied. Haha! So I win! Before I gave her time to look up any reviews or summaries, off we were.  Now, I never saw the original, so I don't have anything to compare it to - which is usually better, I think. I read some reviews of it, and perhaps I don't have the fine film critic's touch - but I thought this was a great movie. It was interesting. There were some interesting twists. Sure, parts were perhaps a  wee  bit unbelievable, but hey - anything is possible.  Story is as such. Liev Shreiber is a congressman who is "chosen" as the dem's nominee for VP. "Chosen," because his mother, played by Meryl Streep, basically coerces the DNC into accepting him, ousting Jon Voight (who looks like his face is made of plastic.) Shreiber's character is a war hero, one of the few who has received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery in saving his entire squad (I don't know the terminology?) during the Gulf War.  But of course, it's not that easy. Events that night in the Gulf War differ in reality and in memory. And Denzel Washington's character - the leader of the squad that night - is out to finally figure out the truth. And to get to this truth is a very tricky maze indeed, full of deception and lies and whathaveyous.  Denzel Washington was great in his role as the man trying to seek the truth. Liev Shreiber played the part of marionette very well. Meryl Streep was excellent as the controlling senator/mother. Maybe it was a touch overdone and hamhanded at times, but not so that it was overly detrimental to the movie as a whole.  Sometmes, all you want is a movie that makes you think a little, wince a little, wonder a little. One that keeps you on the edge of your seats - but without scary monsters. (I don't like scary movies.) I know critics out there didn't like it terribly much - but who cares about them? I thought it was a fine summer movie.  And it's somewhat relevant to today, given that it's the time of a Presidental election and all.  (Look, I  am  capable of writing posts that aren't entirely about mememe.)

      Scant minutes -  minutes!!  - after writing yesterday's post, I received the following email: I'll be in LA in a couple weeks on business.  Want to catch up for a few drinks?  Let's call him Crew Guy, because - that's right, got it in one! - he rowed crew undergrad.  Let's see. We met through friends the spring of sophomore year. No, wait. We met the fall of sophomore year, but he was always that weird guy who would make random comments to me when I ran into him at parties. Then one fine spring day, I had just returned from showering after a nice jog (what, me run? I know, it was a very odd time in my life when I ran for fun), all bundled up in a thick terry cloth robe.. and who else is sitting in my dorm room conversing with my roommate but Crew Guy.  I am NOT looking anywhere near my best at this moment.  We get to chatting. I want to change into real clothes. But I'm polite, and we talk even though I just want to kick him out.  Him : So, I hear you're quite the chef.  [I was one of the few people off meal plan that year, because I'd rather walk the mile to the supermarket in order to buy and prepare my own food rather than consume that inedible swill called cafeteria food. I would, however, persuade friends to use their guest credits on me on chicken tender days.]   Me : Yeah, I suppose so. You want to have dinner sometime?  THINK BEFORE YOU TALK YOU MORON. Goshdarnit, look at what the merest bit of flattery does to you.  Before you know it, we had a whole - gasp! - date planned, with a visit to a  urlLink museum  before a home-cooked meal. When he left, my roommate burst out into hysterics. "You have a date with  him !" she chortled.  Him , the way she said it, was not in the oh-my-god-he's-so-hot-how-did-you-score-that sense, but rather the what-in-the-hell-is-wrong-with-you sense.  Keep in mind, he was hot. Or so I thought at the time. 6'4, big strong strapping rower, with sandy brown hair and blue blue eyes. Did I mention the muscles? I am a sucker for that part on the upper arm where the deltoids curve into the bicep. And I am even more of a sucker for blue eyes. (Everyone I have gone out with - with the exception of one - has coincidentally had blue or green eyes. It's not a conscious choice on my part, I swear. That one exception wore blue contacts, so I thought they were blue at first.) And he was not just your average dumb jock - oh no! He was majoring in art history and classics. He was a smart jock!  But dammit. I should have taken more heed of my roommate's warning. Mutual friends, over the course of the week, were just stunned.  What in the hell are you doing with him? [laughter] You're way too good for him. Do you know what you're getting yourself into? You? Him? [laughter] Did I listen? No. Because I'm stupid.  And so began the story of my life for the following two years, where we hooked up off and on and on and off. There was never any real commitment - oh yeah, because he couldn't handle it. It's quite the sad and classic tale. We'd go out on a couple of dates, which would then just devolve into booty-IMs for the next couple of months. Then we'd be on vacation, and he'd start proclaiming that he missed me and he couldn't wait to see me. We'd get back to school and he'd all of a sudden be "dating" someone. So we wouldn't talk for a couple of weeks, then it was back to the booty-IMing. It's really pathetic that it went on for so long, but I kept thinking that he had turned another leaf. That he really meant it this time. I mean, hell! After I returned from Paris, he couldn't stop with the, "I can't wait to see you again"s (I have it all saved on IM to prove that I'm not delusional) - then he came to NY to visit me that summer, and it was just bizarre. (Actually, fuckwit was my rebound from Crew Guy. Funny how things work out.) He would bring up questions potentially leading to commitment, such as: "Would you raise your kids Jewish?" (he is Jewish, I am not) and "Would you convert to Judaism after you got married?" and "Where do you want to get married? Oh, the beach? That sounds like a great idea." What was a girl to think? I just kept "seeing this other side" to him that nobody else saw - the sensitive, intelligent and caring side - and I'm convinced it's still there. It's just too bad he has to act like such a jerkwad because for some reason he needs to be all cool and macho.  By the fall of senior year, I started to tire of this back-and-forth, and would do things such as get him to invite himself over to my apartment, where then I'd suddenly - yawn! - be too tired to do anything, and all I really want to do is sleep thankyouverymuch. I was able to pull this stunt many more times than I should've been able to. Or I would  know  that he wanted to hook up, by the way he hovered around me, so I would purposefully bat my lashes at the closest cute guy and flirt massively with him instead.  Finally, I did finally, more or less, cut him out of the booty call cycle the spring of senior year, as I had bigger fish to fry. (That would have been my slutty phase of college, of which funnily he was not a part. This was around the time he quit crew and started getting a slight paunch. Not coincidental, I swear.) There was one last night in Italy, but that's rather forgettable.  Did I mention that even though this lasted for over two years, we never once had sex? He never even attempted it. My theory is that he must have been a virgin. Obviously he was attracted enough to me to keep hooking up. So either he was a virgin, or he was balls-out terrified (haha!) that sex equaled commitment, which it so doesn't, not all the time at least. But I like my virgin theory better. Seriously. Two years.  But since then! My life has been Crew Guy-free! Even though he lived up in Boston (he has recently moved to DC), I kept my contact with him to a minimum because he is sometimes just so annoying.  So back to the present day. Why did I agree to have dinner with him? At one of the nicest restaurants in LA? Ah, well, he appreciates fine dining. He doesn't know that fuckwit and I have broken up. Oh brother. What did I get myself into? I've definitely dug myself a nice pretty hole with this one.  Remember: THINK BEFORE YOU TALK YOU MORON. Obviously, I have not yet learned this lesson yet.  Oh yeah, I nearly forgot. Date with Blue-tie Guy early next week. He apparently knows that we went around calling him Tie Guy. Hahaha! Ah, and I have the feeling he's in The Industry, based on the fact that he said he works at Universal. Sigh. At least now I know his name. That's a good thing, I feel.  I suck at keeping resolutions.

      I take it  all  back.  I don't want Blue-tie Guy to call anymore (which he hasn't, the bastard - but that's the ego and the pride speaking there). I don't want to deal with the drama of a divorced guy.   En fait , I don't want to hear from any guy for at least the next three weeks. When I move back to Boston, this ban will be lifted. But until then, I don't want to hear from the male gender at all.  I forgot that I had decided that the rest of the summer, after fuckwit and I broke up, was a time for me to remember how great life is  sans  male company. Because it  so  is. It had been a long while, after all, since I've been single - 2 years. Actually, summer of 2001 was spent with fuckwit, the following school year with a whole string of different guys, and then back to fuckwit. And before all of that it was random dates and flings and what-have-yous. Not that I'm one of those girls who  needs  to be dating to make me feel like a complete person - rather, I enjoy seeing how far and how high I can make guys jump. It really is a hobby. But anyway, so really, it's been more like since freshman year of college that I've been completely and utterly guy-free.  So July and August were to be rededicated to doing things for me and to hanging out with friends.  Without men . A return to a more innocent time, of my years in an all-girl's school, where we were blissfully innocent, not aware of the havoc the male gender can wreak on a young girl's sanity. Luckily, the majority of my adoring male throng is located on the East Coast and points beyond, so it was going to be easy.  Now after the tizzy of the weekend, I've decided to return to my original plan.  No guys . Not for the current moment. I never thought I'd say those words - but saying them I am.  What - or who - brings this all on, you ask? Remember my mention of Comedy Guy? That's who. The Monday after his party, I received the following email: Delightful seeing you Friday, thanks for coming! Now I intend to take you up on your promise to recommend a fine local restaurant. Are you free Weds. night? Sure, it could be a harmless email, but I had it checked out by a slew of people I know and trust, and they all said, no, don't be delusional, he's asking you out on a date, especially given past history of him having an unrequited crush on you. So I hemmed and hawed, considered going out to dinner with him but not until I had figured out some way to let him know that it was Only As Friends, as I am SO NOT interested in him. Let's emphasise that  NOT . I wasn't interested in him freshman year, I'm not interested in him now. Things will NEVER change. Not to mention the fact that I can never talk to him for more than 8 minutes at a time before I run out of conversation. And that's what I'm scared of the most in the entire world - running out of things to talk about. What would I do for a whole dinner? Truth be it, I'd rather sit at home alone on a weekend night rather than go out with him. (Coincidentally, my  urlLink horoscope  - I'm a Virgo - agrees with me.) So I wrote back: Thanks for inviting me (and everyone else) to your party! It was nice to catch up, albeit briefly. Oh, by the way, thanks for sending blue tie guy over to talk; it was great fun. I would love to go to dinner on Wednesday - it's always fun to have friends with whom to dine out in LA - but unfortunately I already have plans. I'd tentatively ask about some time this weekend, except for the fact that it's the countdown to my friend's wedding and we bridesmaids are being kept on a very tight leash for the next couple of weeks - but perhaps she'll allow me a breather. Who knows. She actually is bridezilla incarnate. You know. Very nice and polite, and not discounting friendship - but doesn't it read No I Am Not Going To Go To Dinner With You Anytime In The Near Future? That's the message I meant it to convey, at least, sugar-coated because there's no reason to burn bridges. I enjoy his parties. I meet interesting people there. They're just not him. Of course, his being of the male species and all, he sooooo did not get this: Yes, did Tie Guy and your friend hit it off? The only things I know about him are that he's recently divorced and wears a tie constantly. But I hope I was able to help her?  As for you, this is completely unacceptable. You're being held like an indentured servant! Please tell me this bride's name and I'll report her to Amnesty International, and you and I will dine. If necessary I'm prepared to operate a commando operation myself. I'll expect to have a restaurant, date, and time from you posthaste. Holy Mother of Idon'tknowwhat - he didn't get it. Or at least he pretended not to get it. Sure, it's flattering, but you know that saying, "don't beat a dead horse"? It applies here! I wanted desperately to write back, "Funny you ask that about Tie Guy - actually, he ended up taking my number," but I decided to hold off responding for awhile. Then! Instead of letting me make the next move - let's beat the dead horse further! Comedy Guy IMed me at work! It went along the lines of this:  Him : The bridesmaid thing is unacceptable. You gave me lavish promises of restaurant recommendations, which, since I eat Baja Fresh three nights a week, was tantalizing.  Him : How about Thursday? I'm sorry. I gave him  recommendations , I did not say I was going to go with him. Plus I was drunk, and when I'm drunk I'm really friendly. And didn't I already politely turn him down? Obviously he was going to need something stronger than the mere polite brush-off. So, I had to pull out the imaginary quasi-boyfriend.  Me : I'm sorry, I'm going down to Newport Beach that day to see this guy I'm dating. Yes, a blatant lie, but he doesn't have to know that. (And yes, I decided to pretend that Cute British Guy was in CA because if Comedy Guy was going to press for details, at least I wouldn't have to outright make stuff up). You'd think that'd do it. HAH! We forget that Comedy Guy went to That School In Cambridge* where they are woefully inept at male-female interactions and prefer to focus only on the goal and bulldoze their way there, rather than using tact and circumspection and knowing when to retreat as necessary. Maybe this characteristic enables you to rule the world, but it isn't necessarily going to get you girls.   Him : Well, tell him that if he's a gentleman, he'll let you off that night so you can entertain me. What Part Of No Did He Not Understand? So I had to be blunt and say:  Me : I'm sorry, I've already made plans with him. Conversation was summarily ended, much to my relief.  But after this entire exchange, I realise that my pulse was pounding with indignation over the fact that he didn't understand matters, that I WAS TYPING IN ALL CAPS TO MY FRIENDS TO EMPHASIZE THE DIRENESS OF THIS SITUATION and basically, that I was stressing myself out. Over what? Over a  guy . Over someone with the XY chromosome who does not deserve such an output of effort on my part.  My summer was supposed to be stress-free. The only way to do that is to cut out guys. So that's what I shall do. I'm cutting them out.**    *Why the hell am I going there again? It's not going to be a pretty year for dating, that's for sure. Hopefully, this ineptness is only found amongst the undergraduate population. One can dream. **I know, I know, famous last words. It has been  kindly  pointed out to me that pre-fuckwit, I used to say these words every 6 weeks. But goshdarnit, this time I'm certainly going to try.

      So to finish up yesterday's story.  We had chosen Blue-tie Guy for Scarlett. Just because we could. It was based on nothing more than pure girlish mischef - hey, that's what happens when you stick a bunch of girls together and leave them with nothing to do but make fun of other guests' weird weird outfits (see: brown suede stiletto clog mules).   Anyway, I could have honestly given two shits about Blue-tie Guy. He was a fun and harmless diversion, spiced up the party some, etcetc.   Until he asked for my number.  Dammit, I swear, Scarlett, we picked him out for you, so if you still want him you can have him. Yes, I do realise that you didn't want him in the first place and nearly killed me when I sent Comedy Guy to talk to him so that's why I didn't feel bad giving him my number. Besides, you said it was okay. I swear on my future little white dog that we all totally meant for the two of you to get together. Based on what, I don't know. But we were supposed to find  you  the love of  your  life, not some trivial dalliance for me. What he wants with a mouthy and contrary little pain in the ass like myself is beyond me.   Anyway, he said he'd call. And while before I wouldn't have cared if I never saw him again - now that he said those words I find myself nearly permanently attached to my cell phone in the hopes that he'll call. Damn expectations. And damn guys for raising such expectations.   I mean, seriously. I'm not even sure what this guy's name is, much less what he looks like. (Scarlett says he looks like  urlLink this , but I'm not so sure.) If we met somewhere, he'd  have  to wear a stupid blue tie just so that I could identify him.   This is pathetic. I only have 3 weeks left in LA also, so it's not like anything could really happen. Hell, to make it a decent summer fling I'd have to sleep with him on the first date in order to accelerate matters and bring them up to proper speed.  So why do I hold my breath every time my phone rings?   [Addendum]  Comedy Guy - who will  not  leave me alone, dammit, but that's a whole different matter - told me that Blue-tie Guy apparently wears ties all the time (yay! I love a guy in a tie!) and that he's recently divorced (which while I should be shuddering over the amount of baggage this means, I'm perversely intrigued because this obviously is just a summer fling and I've never gone out with a divorced guy).

      So I'm going to try writing a post that doesn't paint myself as being self-centred and narcissistic.  Haha. That's not going to happen. I am both. You wouldn't guess it, but I'm actually really shy (at first) and terrified of speaking before large groups. Must rethink plans to become a professor.   In LA, nearly  everyone  is part of The Industry. After all, isn't that why they're out here? (That, or because LA has the most perfect weather of anywhere 90% of the time.) Fuckwit used to tell people he was an actor to get strangers to stop talking to him, because well - aspiring actors are a dime a dozen here. Anyone with a pretty face is trying to make it in that nasty world of show business. Or they're trying to get in behind-the-scenes, as a screenwriter, an assistant to the assistant of a producer, a mail room clerk, a floater in an agency..   It's a nasty business, and utterly cutthroat. Of all the career choices I considered, getting involved in The Industry never even crossed my mind - probably because you have to slave away and kiss some major ass for years without getting paid much before you've "made it." As can be guessed, I'm none too good at pandering to other's needs, especially if I don't benefit from it in any way.   But it's fun - sometimes - to hang out with people in The Industry. They  do  do cool things and more often than not have some very interesting stories. Or they make for interesting stories. Back when I used to keep in touch with a girl from college who worked as an assistant at one of the larger talent agencies, I'd go to parties with her when I was in town. It was always interesting when, after about an hour of being at a party, it would suddenly double in size because the people in the back room doing coke were done snorting their lines.   It's also fun when you're at these parties and everyone just  assumes  that you're part of The Industry in some way. Such was the case at Comedy Guy's party Friday night. (Thankfully, the drug of choice there was good ol' alcohol, instead of anything more illicit. I'm no prude, but it's just odd when you know that there's some line-snorting going on next door.) Conversations - when the Fortress of Four (explained below) was penetrated - went something like this:  Me :And so, what are you doing out here?  Person in Industry : I'm  [an assistant at an agency/an assistant sound technician/a writer/a professional brown-noser/an actor on Punk'd/etcetcetc] . What do you do?  Me : I'm doing research for the summer..  PiI : Oh, how refreshing! It's always nice to talk to someone who isn't in The Industry! Repeat ad infinitum. It is also really damn hard (especially when drunk) to explain what a Master's in Education is, especially to someone no longer in academia. "So you're going to be a teacher?" they inevitably ask. NO!!! That's an MAT (Master's in the Art of Teaching? I think..) I will be studying  what  education is.. which I realise sounds awfully lofty and abstract.   Oh, the Fortress of Four consisted of  urlLink Scarlett , my friend Katie (who was mightily irked that the only reason she was invited to this party was through me, so she'd proclaim to anyone who'd listen that she lived in Comedy Guy's entryway freshman year. You snooze - or in her case, you're a massive studier with a chip on your shoulder who doesn't know what fun is unless you're bashed over the head with it - you lose. She's more fun now. College wasn't a good time for her) another friend and me. We stood in the corner and made fun of people. Hey, you wear an ugly micro-pleated skirt with even uglier brown suede stiletto clog mules (yes, that's what they were), you are going to be made fun of. Indeed, we were  those  girls who come to parties and drink and socialise with only each other - which I realise we can do without being at a party, but then who would we make fun of? We were an impregnable fortress, for the most part.    I think the most fun of the night was had when we decided to find Scarlett the love of her life at this party because, well, I told her that he was going to be there. I just  know  these things. So we picked out the most decent-looking guy (rather damn hard, this was not a pretty party with wannabe actors; there's a reason behind-the-scenes people are behind-the-scenes), who also happened to be the only guy wearing a tie and slacks and wildly out of place in the land of vintage shirts and jeans and therefore a much easier target. And then we got Comedy Guy to try to figure out what his deal was (even though he did not know him), and to tell Blue-tie Guy (which is henceforth how I will be referring to him) that it would be preferable if he could speak with an Australian or any British accent. Unfortunately, Blue-tie Guy did not have a foreign accent, but it was rather amusing how Comedy Guy dragged him inside, mid-cigar smoking and all, deposited him before the Fortress of Four and promptly abandoned him, leaving him in front of four mouthy girls who then proceeded to barrage him with questions, the poor guy. It was like the Spanish Inquisition. I have to say, he held his own and more. In retrospect, he was very dodgy with his answers too. I think all we got out of him is that he's 33, lives in North Hollywood, drinks rye, had chicken for  urlLink dinner  that night and came to the party with a friend. That's it! (Or that's all I can remember.) He never even divulged as to what he did or as to why he was so dressed up, and I  know  we peppered him with many a question regarding those two fronts. He's a clever and sneaky one!   To be continued, perhaps, at some later date.
