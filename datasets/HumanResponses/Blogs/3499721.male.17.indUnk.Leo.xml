      已经连续三天刮沙尘暴了，搞的我没有心情。忘记了是上个星期几，玮玮给我带来了好消息，他找到了一个自称是你弟的人，似乎有什么亲戚关系。在十八中上学。本以为找到你是一定是事，但没想到今天中午我给玮玮打电话，第一个坏消息是李燕出车祸了，第二个就是那个男孩给你家打电话说你家电话没人接，哎...真他妈的晕死。为什么我做什么事都这么不顺呢？难道这就是所谓的好事多磨吗？ 今天我又上了4个小时的网，一直在找你，没有一点线索和进展。并且我也在那个所谓的204板块发了帖子，他们说应该可以找到，但我并没有抱太大希望。不论他们是一个怎样的组织，找一个人很的就如大海捞针一样，所以我不在奢望。现在我只能通过玮玮来找你。这个学期我一点学习的心情都没有，我就是一心一意的想要找到你，我不知道我找到你后会不会安心学习，但我知道如果我找不到你我是绝对没有心情去学习的。何超我现在做的这一切你是否能够了解呢？今天听“我愿意”我哭了。因为现在就算是我有一千个一万个愿意，都于事无补了。因为我都不知道你在哪里。对于现在自己所做的一切，我从来都没有后悔过。就算我永远都找不到你。因为曾经我伤害了你，因为我曾经用自己的自私伤害了你，现在这些都是我应得的，听一听那首爱情悬崖，想想拥有你时的自己是那样的幸福。其实一个人心里有一个去惦记和牵挂的人，也未尝不是一件好事，就象现在的我在也不会象以前那样迷茫了。我彻底的摆脱了从前，我可以用心爱你。没有顾虑没有负担，只有爱和喜欢。但我没有了机会。 我现在胃好疼呀。怎么回事？好难受....我明白你不会属于我，我...疼..受不了了！

      好久没有写日记了，因为那段时间没有得到一点消息和进展，找了那么久没有一点成绩，有几分失意。对知道的信心有几分怀疑。也许我真的已经消失在一的生活之外，也许你真的已经全部忘记，如果是那样，我找到你对你来说会不会是无聊的举动。你会不会笑我。我的这番举动连我自己都觉得不可思议。昨天我又一次拨通了你家的电话，是吴静帮我打的，因为我没有胆量和勇气接受你家人的回绝。结果我没有猜错，你妈妈接电话说何越不在。哎...无奈了。当时我真的都快麻烦死了，找到何越是我找你的最容易的途径，但我却在这条路上无法前进一步。我真的快被气死了。原以为找到梁雪就可以找到何越，可谁知我根本就没有机会和何越说话，更别谈别的了。这几天我又费了几经周折找到了梁雪，让她帮我问何越，不知道会不会有好消息。但这起码也算是有条路了吧~她告诉我何越在回中上学~好象在高3一班，如果梁雪找不到你的地或QQ号的话，我想就只有找玮玮来帮我了，那样会不会对何越有什么影响呢？只要能找到你我什么都可以去做！真的有几分心灰意冷，但现在有了梁雪好象心里略有几分塌实。但我以前那样对她，他会认真的帮我吗？她不会因为以前的事情反而...那我可就完蛋了。如果她真的帮我找到了你的话。我回去好好招待他！何超，你说这次我能找到你吗？我真的有点害怕！我怕何越不告诉我，如果是这样的话我就真的一点办法都没有了。那样也只有无休止的等待了。希望你会保佑我让我找到你！在网上找一个人真的是太难了。我想利用那个华人BBS的可能性简直是太渺茫了，不现实。如果在上面真的可以找到你。那绝对属于奇迹。遇见你是一个奇迹，我想上天不会那么偏爱我吧！超，你是回民对吧！如果这次我找到你的话，我就决定从回了。怎么样啊？这个想法是不是很幼稚，但我就是想这样做。那样的感觉一定很幸福！为一个所爱的人坚守一种信仰，是多么幸福啊。曾经是我自己背弃了爱，背叛了你，现在我愿意用所以来换会你可能吗？想的太简单了是不是？那就想的复杂一点。你永远都不会原谅我，不会回来，不会在和我说一句话，那么我们就这样慢慢变老。呵呵多么凄美的结局。我不要这样，我不奢望你能很容易很快的原谅我，但我不希望你永远都不会原谅我。我想的是不是太远了。还没有头绪呢。等找到你的邮箱在考虑这些吧！我不想让自己摔的太残。我不能一败涂地，我要给自己留下一定的空间，用来接受失望和背叛后的痛苦。有人说：伟大的人有两颗心，一颗用来流血，一颗用来包容。我想我也应该做一个这样的人。如果这辈子真的无法找到你，那么我选择用两颗心去体会公平和这份特殊的爱！一个女人学会了逢场作戏，放任自己的唯一理由是报复，可是她究竟报复了谁？一个女人放任自己又能报复谁！我又报复了谁？最爱我的人被我伤的最深。 超，对不起！你是我最美的——意外

      何超，你现在在忙什么呢？起床了吗？有没有看见我在BBS上发的帖子啊！也不知道有没有人给我回复，今天我给玮玮写完信了，不知道她能不能帮我找到何越，但我不会放弃任何一个机会。玮玮问我为什么你去了加拿大我还找你？也许你不相信，我真的爱上你了。她也许不会相信我会这样一直等下去。但是我真的会。不知道这个星期去了会不会有什么新发现。 今天我的心情不太好，有几分失落。但一想起你又好了很多。无论我失去了什么，但我始终有我不变的信念——我要找到你！所以失去什么都不可惜，反而它们的消失会让我更专心的去找你，不是吗？：）有得必有失。就象当初一样。现在我去补救还来的及吗？我相信成功往年望是在坚持以后，无论以后我们会不会有个好结果，但回想起来曾经我也为它努力过，我想就不会有遗憾吧！ 其实输了也不是一件坏事，因为如果不能赢就一定有它输的理由。人的一生只是一场选择，怎么做都是可以的，关键是我们要明白自己需要的究竟是什么，并且在决定之后不要后悔，也无法后悔，所以永远都不要问可不可以！

      昨天晚上我睡的很塌实，这是这学期来了以后，第一次睡的如此安稳。也许是有点累的缘故吧。不知道我发的那张帖子有没有人响应。不会石沉大海了吧！今天下午我们上了两节舞蹈课，下课以后我回宿舍洗衣服，洗完衣服我和她们一起玩抓红A，没想到我一个人就抓了三张，最后我竟把她们5个人给赢了。好高兴！你呢？今天过的怎么样？有没有上网呢？是不是你已经不上网了？不会对我那么残忍吧！ 超，也许拥有是上天的偏爱，失去是上天的残忍，拥有后在失去才是上天的公平。也许因为一些不可预知的变故相爱的人会被分开，但真正的爱是不会消失的，它仍然以另外的方式存在着。以前你在我身边我那么简单的带你，现在你离开了我用寻找的方式来爱你，我要用时间和我的努力来挽回你。哪怕过程很苦很单调。哪怕结果很糟很无聊。一点一滴的搜索，那仅有的并不完整的回忆，每一个回忆的片段都是你。我知道我永远等不到，需要你的时候会听到你的脚步声，我知道我永远盼不到，想你的时候你能张开温暖的怀抱，我心痛哭泣的时候，有你轻轻擦去我的泪。我等不来也盼不到。但我依然不放弃要找！找那个我心灵的依靠。你象慢性毒药，开始时没有药效，原来是时候未到。现在它发作了让我难熬。我想我会这样死掉，满脑子都是你何超，让我坐这永远的爱情的牢！超，你现在过的好不好！可不可以让我知道，我只想找到你，但我不知道自己究竟该怎么做，我只有默默的等待，等待你原谅我。会有那么一天吗？我有时候真的不敢去想，你现在也许已经不在是一个人。也许上完学就结婚了吧。真的好可怕，但往往现实总是残酷的。但我却从未想过自己会失败。为什么？我有你家里的点，原以为可以很容易的得到你的消息，可是事情没有那么乐观，你的家人也许已经讨厌那个给你家打过几次电话问你地址的那个女孩。所以我决定放弃这条路。玮玮给我写信了，我准备让她帮我打听一下何越的情况，也许会对我找你有帮助。我不会打扰他是生活，你放心我只是想找到你。好了不和说了，我要给她回信了！希望可以梦见你，希望你别忘了我。希望...

      何超，今天我在网上整整找了你六个小时，也算有点小小的收获吧。对于我来说他已经构成了让我兴奋的因素。我找到了一个多伦多的华人BBS，上面有人多留学生发的帖子。我多么希望你也在其中呀。于是乎我注册了一个号。用户名：伊静。不知道你看到了会有什么想法。呵呵，昨天的收获也不错，找到了一个也是在多伦多留学的人，是辽宁的。一个长相微胖热心的男孩叫王权，他给我留了邮箱，我告诉了他我加他的原因，他问我们之间的事，我告诉他，但隐瞒了我们分开的细节，我告诉他结果你离开了。不，是消失了。他突然说了一句：也许他也会消失。我不知道他为什么要这样说。便问他是什么意思，他说没什么。我下意识的将他的邮箱和QQ号记在我的邮箱里，因为呀是唯一一个说要帮我找你的人，也是我的一线希望，我不允许他消失。今天看见了那个华人BBS有一个帖子里全是照片，看到了那些红男绿女是那样的优秀，我有一丝的失落。我一个平凡的小女孩，怎么有能力让你在那个大千世界里为我停留片刻，更何况都过了将近半年的时间。但按个念头在我的脑海里只停留了不到一分钟便打消了。我找你并不奢望你回到我身边，我只是想找到你看你过的好不好。只想和你说对不起，事实告诉我原来世界真的好公平，我已经得到了应受的惩罚，也许会失去许多。只是因为一个错，我的贪玩害了我。有些事我永远都不能和别人说，只可以受折磨，我笑着，笑着接受这结果，笑着感受这落寞，笑着享受一个人的生活，笑的等待花开花落，等到我七老八十依然没有找到你，那时候我会唱一首“我等的花儿也谢了”：）人的一生只有一次，是该为自己而活，还是是该为别人而活，其实人都是在为爱而活。曾经我找不到了爱的能力，我找不到了认真和自我，我找不到了生活的方向和目标，我游戏着生活，可后来才发现是生活游戏着我。我真的错了。王权说：一个人错了，但他知道改了就是好的。那你觉得呢？曾经因为他伤害了我，所以我害怕爱情，我怕自己在认真的在乎一个人，从内心里我不愿意接受爱。但我想用另一段爱情来治疗伤痛，于是便有了以后我们之间的事情，更错的是我爱你。我会时时刻刻的想你，我想你的电话你的声音。我感觉你就在我身边，我认真的在乎你。但我还要给你不安全的感觉，让你时刻也想着我，但每一次我的小聪明总是可以让你看穿，哎...真没面子。你还总是用心的包容我的小聪明。谢谢你。后来我得了胃病，那几天你也没有给我打电话，我很失落。在后来我便找了一个所谓的男朋友，其实他只是陪我玩，只是一个玩伴罢了。但当时我竟然鬼使神差的不接你的电话。和他相比你是那样的高高在上。而他只是我身边的一个普通人，而且是人渣。我向他提出分手，他声称：得不到我就毁了我。（别把我想的那么不专一我也曾想过好好和你在一起，想要嫁给你，但我们之间的差距你不介意我介意）那段时间是我人生中最黑暗的时间。我真的想过自杀，但我还有家人，他真的很可怕，我觉得他很变态。那几天我真的快被折磨死了，人不象人鬼不象鬼的。也就是最后一次你在视频上见我的时候，我披散了头发，你让我梳起来我没有听，如果当时我听你的把头发梳起来，是不是我还可以和你多说一句话，后悔呀。你的坚决让我好怕，但想想我当初用那样的冷的态度对你，那才可怕呢！ 何超，对不起本来你人在异国，我还那样伤你的心。真的好残忍。对不起，我知道你当时的痛苦比起我现在找你的心情那简直...我现在这样又算的了什么呢？我不怕时间长的等待，我只怕没有结果的等待，我突然想到你在今年2月14那天没有给我留言，难道你有女朋友了吗？没什么我会平静接受。有是正常的。在异国他乡找一个可以倾诉心事互相取暖的人也好。也许你们真心相爱。 在现实中见不到你，在梦里见到你也好啊！希望上天恩赐我一个有你的梦。超，那里的天冷吗？ 21：00

      今天中午洗了个澡心情不错，天气也很好。想你！现在是你那里凌晨两点多吧，我想你一定在睡觉。希望你做个好梦。分享时差你曾经用过的网名，不知道你现在是否记得，你现在叫什么呢？资料改了吗？明天我会去上网，不知道是否会找到你，但我会努力的！何超我好想知道我有没有在你的梦中出现过，希望有吧。 我总有这样一种冲动，如果我有一天会找到你，我们用视频聊天，我会用割脉来挽回我们的爱情，如果真的可以，我愿意...我觉得人的一生会有两次真爱，第一次是年幼无知的冲动它太幼稚。那是我不懂什么叫责任。第二次是负责任的爱无论对自己还是对他人。这种爱往往通向婚姻！何超我真的错了，我希望你能回到我身边，我只想让你做我的老公！也许我这辈子真的注定要做单身了。“喜欢是一种欣赏，爱是一种向往”找到你是我不变的愿望，哪怕我们之间不在有交流，只是我单独的倾诉。我只希望你可以收到。超，原来那个不懂爱的女孩已经死了。现在那首歌好适合我。“后来我总算学会了如何去爱，可惜你早已远去消失在人海。后来终于在眼泪中明白，有些人一旦错过就并不在。永远不会再重来，有一个男孩爱着那个女孩。”

      今天的天气比起昨天好了很多，但依然有一丝寒意。我的心情平静的让人不可思议。每天想着放假的日子。时间过的如此之快，晚上7：30我还要去六楼开会。今天下午老李去开班会，叫我的名字我还以为我又犯事了呢，原来是班级工作问题。哎...开一次班会我就等于小死一次。真是的，昨天晚上3点收到一条短信，我突然醒来便想到了你，那时正是你那里下午3点吧~你在做什么呢？如果我们还在一起的话，也许我们在打电话吧！你那里下午是不用上课的对吗？你是在写作业还是在画漫画呢？今天上午实习老师给我们上课教唱歌。姓名：张向辉  他的样子和你略有几分相似，尤其是头发，只是比你当初略短一点，长的没有你帅，个子和你应该差不多吧，但他操了一口地道的赤峰话，就这样我的神游遐想被打破了。哦对了，他也带了一副和你相似的眼镜，另外还有个位漂亮的女朋友。 真不知道我们为什么有那么多话说，和你在一起的时候我又找到了爱的感觉。但对别人，他们很快就会让我觉得恶心。因为他们太低俗。太平凡了。找老公一定要找一个比自己各方面都要高的，这样才有去交往的必要，也才能谈的上会有将来。但将来这个词用在我和你身上，也只能是我一相情愿罢了。不知道为什么我总觉得自己的QQ依然在你的好友里，因为我的自信吗？因为太自负了吧` 但我总是这样想。我觉得我所改了资料你都可以看到，你是在看我可以见多久，是吗？是这样吗？但我今天突然在想，我们失去联系都已经三个多月了，除圣诞节那天你祝我快乐外，应该说是快半年了吧，我还有可能活在你的QQ里吗？如果你删了我，还记得我的号吗？哎...未知...但我还是回想你总有看到的那天的。：）乐观一点，希望老天会帮我。有人说：“得不到的和以失去的是最好的”也许真的是这样吧！ 你还记得有一次忘记是因为什么事情，我把你给惹生气了，后来我上网和你说话你不理我，我整整给你留了4个小时的言，最后我难受的实在坚持不下去了准备走，刚和你说完拜拜，你便回过来一句怎么还不走，我当时差点被气死。哎...那么这次，因为背叛我想你会永远沉默吧！我没有这样的心理准备，因为我坚信自己会等到你，哪怕只是无语的出现。 你今年都24岁的人了，应该很成熟了，那么对我这样的小女孩你还会有当时那样单纯的爱吗？等待吧！时间会说明一切的！我的真心，我的坚持和决心，你的恨，和倔强，终会有个结果的！当我们努力过我们就不会后悔。我就是这样想的。“聪明的人不会去计较结果，他更注重过程；流行的美丽只在于过程。”虽然我不是很认同这句话，但也只有认命了。 希望你可以胖一点，心情好一切都好！爱你是一种奢求，你还会给我机会吗？

      今天这里的风很大，呼市和北京也是一样，这是上网是他们告诉我的。从今天开始赤峰也需要用卡上网，我没有带身份证，没办法办卡，也就意味了这段时间我不能上网，如果那样找你的愿望就更成为一个泡影。所以我去了西网吧，找二哥，终于搞定了这张卡。3月8日那天晚上，我给你家打了电话，抱着一线希望找何越想知道你的邮箱，结果你妈妈接电话，说他去太原了。可能吗？哎...我真的很失望，我想你的家人也是为了你好，怕你被他人影响不好好学习，我理解。这些天赵静和博博一上网就帮我找你，可是还是一无所获，但我丝毫没有一丝绝望，我会继续努力。我把那个打喷嚏的猫改成了多伦多的猫，寻找何超改成了等待复活节，我希望有一天你会看到，我也希望自己的等待有一个结果，哪怕让我失望，我只想找到你，哪怕回不到从前，哪怕你不理我。我只想和你说我想说的话。何超你现在究竟知不知道我在做什么，我在想什么。你是不是在笑我。何超，也许你对我根本已经没有爱了，那么我做的这些就都是徒劳的。因为“当感情由浓转淡，在说什么到已经晚了。”这一点我知道。有人说：”爱是寂寞时撒的慌“也许当时你是寂寞了，现在变的充实，我也就被遗弃了。是这样吗？ 超，我真的好想你，真的好希望你可以回到我的生活中，哪怕你是报复。我好怀念有你的日子，接电话也是一种幸福，我们之间有说不完的话。可现在...在也不会有那样的感觉了。你在那里还好吗？现在应该刚起床吧。会不会想起我。人活的真的很累。身边放着的幸福不要，偏偏去追求那个不存在的。我不知道是什么让我这么强烈的愿望要找到你，但我就是想找到你，找到以后并会好好珍惜，无论是友情还是别的什么。我不知道自己可以坚持多久。我想如果在我今年生日那天你依然没有音讯，我会很伤心，那天我会喝醉一定会，也许还会哭，也许会放弃，所以我希望你会在那天出现！那样的话我也会喝醉，我一定会哭的。超，你还记得吗？我们在一起的时候你说过夏天要回国看我，也就是今年夏天。那现在呢？我们已经没有任何干系你还会回来吗？当然不是看我。但我还是希望你会回来，因为那时我们是在同一个国度呼吸。希望你一切都好！

      今天天气变的暖和了很多，感觉真好。上街买了这个日记本想记点什么，也许是想用这种方式来表达我对你的感觉，更希望有一天你会看到它们，但那只是一个梦吧！昨天我第一次在清醒的状态下给你家打电话，是何越接的。我不知道他能不能找到你的邮箱，会不会告诉我呢？前几天我也给你写了一封信！   何超：  当我再次想起你的时候，你已经在我的生活中消失了半年了。这些日子里我的身边没有缺少过男生，但我依然无法忘记你。尤其是在我和他们在电话中无语的时候，我就更加想你。想曾经我们是那样的默契！想我们的电话，我们的视频，我们那无话不谈的坦诚。和那些不用解释的无语！你有那种我想要的斯文和霸道，我喜欢你的：“找一下焦伊静，谢谢！”和那种呼市味道的爷长爷短，虽然你没有在我身边但你却是那样的了解我，你知道我的沉默不是因为生气，你不会去追问，我不用过多的解释！你用你的方式爱我。我更爱听你说的那段：“我不想走时你会背着我走。”你说的对，是因为我的贪玩和贪恋而失去了你，但我一直不敢承认这一点，因为我真的好后悔！我不这种后悔是我自己造成的。但是它真的被我亲手给毁了。原以为你会和我身边的其他人一样，将成为一个被我遗忘的陌生人，也许我当时是真的想用这种方法来治疗自己的伤口，我没有意识到，其实我是在那并不很痛的伤口上洒盐，让自己痛的超负荷，痛的找不到自我。当痛成为一种习惯，我觉得他不可缺少。这也正是你所说的老天是公平的。它让我失落的时候得到了你，又让我在快乐的时候伤害了你。我没有想到在我们之间会有爱情出现。她们说：你不原谅我，说明你真的认真了。但我希望你不要用这样的方式来证明你的认真。我从小到大只做过两件后悔的事。第一是认识了他，第二就是失去了你。在失去你以后我过得了一段人不人鬼不鬼的日子。心中的苦只有我自己知道。我从来没有对一个人这么长时间仍念念不忘。何超现在的你是不是早已忘了还有这样一个人，一个曾经伤害你的人。  在多伦多一个人过的还好吗？那个白人女孩有没有和你发生什么？那个韩国女孩有没有和你租住一个房子？你依然铺了蓝色床单吗？现在你那里应该是星期5早晨8点吧！你起床了吗？吃早点了吗？是不是还坐地铁上学呢？你们那里现在冷吗？你现在是不是更瘦了？个子有没有长高一点？在大年夜那天你有没有感觉到我在想你？你是不是都忘了中国的大年夜是几月几号了。那天晚上我给你家打电话，他们说你没有给家里打电话，是真的吗？好想你啊，好想得到你的消息！可是可能吗？你真的特别恨我吗？现在还恨吗？如果你恨我也许我会高兴的。因为那代表你还没有忘记我。说实话，我还从来没有见过象你这样有种的男生，也许该叫男人。你是第一个这样倔强和坚定的。也许我们当时是真的用心爱了！你总是说我对你不公平。如果我们眼认识他，也许我们会在一起。何超，你的生日是1982年1月14日吧~如果我没有记错的话，你还记得我的生日和电话吗？我一共给你家打了三次电话，但是每一次都是在我喝的神志不清的时候，连我自己都不知道为什么要打，在电话中又说了些什么。因为在我清醒的时候我都没有勇气去拨通那个电话号码。虽然我知道接电话的永远都不可能是你。“爱情没有谁对谁错，只有谁没有珍惜谁”我承认我错了。我的QQ号还在你的好友你吗？也许你早已经把它删的一干二净了吧！我改的那些资料你看到了吗？那到是我想对你说的话。何超多么希望你也会象我一样有时候也会想起我，当然你是不用自责的！因为你所做的一切都对得起自己和我。总之你努力过。而我...  我的爱情悬崖，你的断了的弦，真的就这样永远的结束了吗？记得你为我放晴天的是吗？我都睡着了，我生平就第一次打通宵电话，和你。你呢？也许也再也不会有人那样对我了！我真的后悔了。就象现在写信一样，它永远都着不到自己的主人，我的爱情也一样。  何超你还好吗？我想你！不知道我可以等多久，但我会努力！是爱，是恨，原来是公平。谢谢你的公平，谢谢你的爱！

      前几天没有写日记，因为班里灯坏了。不过也过的满平淡的。星期6上了一天的网，何越在网上，上了一下线有下去了。就在也没有上来。我白白等了一天。星期日早晨我特地起了个大早，9点到网吧上网，因为那时是你那里晚上9点，我想你们会在，但是我又是白等了一天，我有些灰心了，也有点着急，哎，所以这几天又感冒，又上火的。赵静也在帮我找人不停的想办法。也不知道我哥那有没有消息。王力那。哎，也不知道有没有希望。上晚自习之前我都要听爱情悬崖。昨天我的眼泪又那样肆无忌惮的掉了下来幸好我感冒了，还可以拿它来伪装掉下来的眼泪。说：我一感冒就流泪。何超，你是否也会听听这首歌。 我还给你弟弟留言了。我就这样每个周末在这里等你20个小时，“我真羡慕何超有你这样一个弟弟，真不愧是手足啊！我5.1回去找你，你告诉他我会想他，我找了这么长时间是不会放弃的并且找到后会加倍珍惜。”留完言心情好可许多。不知道他会不会理会我的留言，我有点想不通，我只是想要一下何超的QQ号，我并不想知道别的什么。在说我知道了他的QQ号，只是想和他说话，我没有别的意思，知道了我又做不了什么。为什么他就不能告诉我呢？都坚持到现在了，我想我会一直坚持下去的。不管对不起谁！他们告诉我如果你爱我你就会原谅我。那么如果等到我绝望的那一天，起码我知道你不在爱我。曾经你在网上说过，当时我连接电话的机会都没有给你，是啊。在看看现在，叫报应吧~ 这几天总是睡的很不塌实，总会在凌晨一点左右醒来。总会坐起来看看窗外的星星，总会想想异国的你，总会想起我们一起分享时差，总回想起你第一次和我视频是那腼腆的笑，总会想起你那放荡不羁的话语，和那首晴天，总会......不知不觉流泪。也许在黑暗中人才会展现最憔悴的一面吧！梅梅说：没看出来我每天看起来挺开心的，原来心里这样麻烦。是呀，有时候我自己也怀疑，现在这个灵魂究竟是不是我。她们都说我什么都能放下，但对你...永远做不到。 我是一个被记忆束缚着的人，并且我不打算做失意者，我的状态非常不适合谈恋爱，尤其是你这样一个人我自渐行秽。我其实不过是需要这样一个拥抱做挥别的手势，温柔的凄凉。但结果是不是我连一个凄凉也得不到。过几天就要回呼市了，到时候不知道是否能够找到何越，不知道我会不会下决心去找他。现在他不会告诉我，我想回去以后也没什么太大希望。并且见了以后会是一种什么样的场面，不敢去想，哎...回去以后在说吧。也许这个星期会有进展的。加油！有那么多人支持我，我不能放弃，否则对不起自己！ 爱的最高境界是经得起平淡的流年！

      找到了何越的号，却依然没有找到你，她们都安慰我说这便叫做好事多磨。我知道她们是在安慰我，但我还是很感谢她们。如果没有她们在我身边，我想也许我不会有现在这样好的心态。“我的生活不是黑暗，我只是在经历黑暗。只有尝试过黑暗的人，才了解光明的美。”我想我就是这样。 何越不告诉我你的号，我想我找到你那一定是痴人说梦，所以我想也只有一种办法才可以找到你，但现在还没有实施。等成功了在告诉你。马上就要到5.1了，我还没有打算好要怎么度过那9天。回呼市？回去也没什么意思。无非是见见父母和朋友，如果这次我回去，我想见见何越，但那样的场面一定很尴尬。 这几天我总是在问别人同一个问题，我告诉她们如果她们是你，怎样才可以原谅我，说法不一，但我最相信梅梅的。她说你一定会原谅我的。因为回民都信奉伊斯兰教，所以人的心都很善。呵呵，我相信你是一个好的伊斯兰教徒。所以你会原谅我的~是吧！她们都说只要我有心是一定会找到你的，我相信心诚则灵。因为这是我所期望的！ 我还和梅梅商量好了如果我找到你，等这个暑假回呼市，她就保举我从回。她说那样太早了。等你原来能够我以后。如果我们真的在一起，她在保举我也不迟。我觉得说的也不是没有道理，毕竟信奉一种信仰不是一件随随便便的事。一但做了就一定要做好。所以还是等有了结果在说吧~听说从回时必须有阿訇，而梅梅的爷爷正巧是。所以一切都拜托她了。 听她们说回族比较重大的节日就是大儿旦和小儿旦，所谓大儿旦就是大约在十一月左右，所有的回回每天早晨5点多进食，然后一天都不吃饭，到下午6点多就可以吃东西了。这样持续一个月左右，也就是回民所谓的封斋节。我不明白为什么回民对这个斋字情有独终呢？小儿旦就是二月多，在这个时候大家都要宰牛羊，如果我以后真从了回呢？我一定要做一个虔诚的伊斯兰教徒。和你在一起！我什么都愿意。好幸福啊。所以做梦也可以这样美啊！ 何超，真的希望有一天能够得到你的原谅！也许用宽恕更加恰当。因为当一个人意识到自己的错误的时候，最痛苦的莫过于她承受这错误带来的后果，我就是这样慢慢的承受着。人的一生不单单是享受，更多的是承受。而现在的我就是在验证着这句真理。超，你现在好吗？希望你能够快乐！不论你什么时候会原谅我，只要你开心怎么样做都可以。原谅我好吗？？？

      今天是清明节，我终于和何越在网上见面了。这是我盼望了多久的一幕啊。可是他是那样简单的否定我那么长时间的成果。 I：你好！ Y：好！ I：你在那？ Y：我哥说他想忘了你。 I：我求你告诉我他的号，我找他找了好久。我在BBS上发了很多帖子，但还是没有找到他，我希望你可以告诉我他的号，我不知道我还有什么办法可以找到他，谢谢！ Y：我想结果令你失望了！ I：我求求你了，我只想知道他的我网号好只想和他说话。 Y：这是他的意思！ I：好的谢谢你，你告诉他我一定会找到他的。 Y：......                             （大概就是这样吧） 再也没有音讯。也许是他走了吧！哎...这条路终于还是没有走通，何超今天这一幕你知道吗？我了解你，我知道何越说的都是你的意思。何超，那如果我真的找到你，你又会怎样呢？说实话我没有被人背叛过，我不知道那是一种怎样的感觉，但我想一定比我现在被人拒绝要难受的多吧！所以我现在这样又算的了什么呢？何超无论是怎样的苦难我都会克服。我不在乎时间和精力。我相信总有一天你会原谅我的。何越说：你想让了我。那他的意思是你还没有忘记的我是吗？那看来我还算幸运，我很满足了·现在的我没有要求也没有权利去要求。 超：起码现在你知道我在找你，我好高兴。现在是你那里星期日的早晨吧！希望你有一个好心情。记得要好好的吃饭。照顾好自己。不要总是喝酒了那样对身体不好。我想你现在不经常上通宵了吧，如果你经常上应该是可以找到你的。不知道你网上的人多不多？有没有聊的很好的网友呢？现在我一点学习的心情也没有！哎...混完算了。我突然在想，是不是你根本就不喜欢我。但为了不让我伤心，所以才这样说的。恨一个人的感觉究竟是什么样子？它的有效期限难道是一辈子？那我岂不是会变成一个疯子！ 如果一个人一辈子可以实现自己的愿望，那是幸运更是幸福。我想我算的上是一个幸运的人。那么我要我的幸福。喜欢是一种欣赏爱是一种向往。我从小到大都没有对一件事情认真过，这次我决定不游戏。我不会放弃的！我发现这次我是越失败就越有信心，往往成功就在坚持之后。所以我要成功，我要坚持！超，现在你是我的一个梦。一个有方向的梦，所以我要一直做下去。它一定会有一个结果。不平凡的开始不平凡的经过，不平凡的结果。我要去创造这些不平凡。无论最后我会变成什么样。我是那么卑微，我好象已经不再那样自信了。 也许从今天开始我在堕落...落...落...哈哈 我会后悔吗？有时候我真的想死。例如现在！社会已经不在相信眼泪。如果我死了你会哭吗？

      前两天给权伟婕打电话，没想到他竟然找到了何越的网号。昨天下午我去上网加上了他，我还因为他也许不会经常上网，可我没想到今天中午赵静上网他竟然给我发送了请求。说明他昨天或今天上午已经上网了，这仅仅是一个巧合还是他经常上网呢？我好兴奋呀。 明天我一定要上网等到他，我一定要让他告诉我你的号。我一定不能失去这次机会。希望老天保佑我，希望他明天会上网。希望他可以告诉我你的号。也希望他不会把我删掉。希望从明天开始我可以重生。希望... 何超我现在真的很想你。非常非常想你。但我怕我受不了你的沉默，更害怕你会告诉我：你们两个人现在很好，你讨厌我的打扰，你对我没有任何感觉，连恨都没有。那我岂不是不需要在活下去了吗？我怕。真的有一点没有勇气接受，现在找不到你我还抱有着幻想和期望。当一切都将成为现实你在依次的出现在我的生活里，并亲口说出不要再见了，那时的我会不会死掉，我想我会！当一个人没有了希望，没有了目标，那他还有什么呢？两个人一旦分开，第一个忘记的是他的相貌，最后忘记的是他的声音，我还记得你的声音，并且我不允许自己忘记。我背叛了你，我不能在背叛自己。一点一滴的搜索那仅有的并不完整的回忆，每一个回忆的片段都是你。在这个腐烂而陌生的城市中，夜空依然会有星星，很多。在这个进步而蜕变的生活里，身边依然会有故事，很多。在这个赤裸而又开放的社会中，依然会有真爱。它是我生活中独一无二的，那你呢？是否愿意来我完成这唯数不多的爱。你是我爱里的唯一，那我呢？会是你的几分之几？我一定要找到答案。 某时某地遇到某人一切都是无知的。如果有故事发生叫注定。如果没有故事发生叫做过眼云烟。我不希望你是烟，更不希望你知识那种光是过眼而已的烟。 曾经我说过要做手中的一颗棋。现在我是否连上场的机会都没有。连做一个小兵的资格都没有。没有...没有...什么都没有！

      Today was yet another day of my life. i'm feeling out of reach, it seems to be that i am isolated from everyone around me, maybe because i'm not in school rite now, while everyone else are working their butts off to prepare for the Final Examination, for many it is the last of highschool.   I have no idea what another year of highschool will bring me, the kind of challenges i will face. what i do know is this is my year, this is when my life gets turned around. man, that sure sound exciting! although a lot of focus and determinations will have to take place in order for that to be achieved, i'm sure i will overcome the hard times. To all my friends who are parting to the next stage of their lives:"Watch out! i'm rite behind ya!" lol  I've turned away from God for quite a while now, havn' gone to church in at least 2 or 3 months, i guess i didn' want to communicate, to discuss my sorry ass life. now i'm gradually getting back on track again, guess i might start to go to church again. i also regained my Faith in God, which is AWESOME!  Today I recieved the Dell Notebook my dad ordered, man this is so damn cool, but too bad, my dad is going to take it back to China, and possibly give it to my cousin before he comes back. But i understand, we r going through a critical stage financially, my dad always wanted to give my cousin a computer as a reward and encourgement towards his university journey, i'm glad too.   i wonder wut blake and jing r doing rite now, probably still up studying. Good Luck guys!

      today can be called wonderful.  i woke up late and got into an argument with my dad.  luckily blake called and i dragged him down to the library with me and li.  he did look awesome today.    while li worked away @ algeo, blake and i had yet another serious talk.  this one was past the emotional stuf, we just really looked @ our options.  whenever i thought about blake and his university stuff, i just think about how centred he is.  how absolutely planned his life could be.  and i look @ myself.  i just want to go to UT, and then maybe somewhere down the line, someone could guide into the right path.  nonetheless, i'm content.  i just noe wherever i end up i'll make the best of it.    the way i see it in my head right now.  i'm brinking a long distance relationship.  which is extremely odd for me because i've never had one of those. but the more openly we talked about it.  the better i felt.  we talked about some of the things/feelings we'll experience.  and we both said that if things dunt work out.  we'll be the best of friends.  and haha maybe meet somewhere down the road...oh the endless possibilities.     BUT .  i dun wanna think about us parting now.  especially not after having such a fun day.  after the library we went over to blake's house and played gunbound.  it actually turned out to be an interesting game.  blake heated us dinner and then we went to play basketball.  that was pretty fun.  and  good news !! i didn't run into any weirdos on the subway.  i am thankful.  thankful also for great friends jack, li and other ppl.     most thankful of all for the bestest friend and lover, my BFG.

      so.  i was in the subway trying to get home.  as i was waiting for the training to come.  this old man come up to me and says, "miss, u huv a green worm crawling out of ur pants."  my first reaction was, "WTF!".  anyway.  i turn to look for the "green worm" and finally i found a piece of green grass sticking out of my waistline.  i was thinking..."sheit, i couldn't even see it.  how the F. did u see it."  anyway.  he came back and said, "guess i was mistaking, it was only a piece of grass."  and this is when i came to the conclusion that i...  attract horny, old, persian, black, men.   on a brighter note: i  love  blake luo.   my wrongwrong .    one more thing: jack is awesome for making this blog.  for the 3 musketeers.  haha.

      Bad day, nothing went well 2day  "shut up"  didn' really expect that one, although i could imagine her saying that.  today i look back, and yes, i've made many mistakes in my life, thought i was mature enough to take on the world, truth is, it's way beyond my grasp. i underestimated everything

      Last day of May, jus had a huge argument with my mom.. i know i shouldn' be rude to her, but she drives me crazy sometimes..   Today is so cloudy, the weather networks says it's ganna rain in the afternoon.  Today i'm going to confess my love, wonder how will she react:  "uh...ok"(roll eyes) "haha"(laughs) "thank you?"(smiles) "i'm sorrie, i got a boyfriend.." "i love you, too!"(this would be nice to hear) "no..i don' wanna jeopardise our friendship"(unlike her) "let's jus stay friends, ok?"(sigh)  anyways, i guess this is also the fun part of relationships, u'll never know wut the other person ganna say..   good luck to myself today

      I havn' had relationships with a girl in a long long time... mostly because i've lost faith in love, it always turn out to be the opposite of fairytales, guess that's why they called it fairytale in the first place, it's jus an unaccomplishable fantasy.  It's funny how the mind works, sometimes u jus cant control, and the thought of losing control of ur own mind is horrifying... I never had any intension to fall in love again, frankly, i never thought i was able to, but i did. and i don' even know how she feels about me... see, it already made me weak, i cant take my mind off her, i couldn' even sleep for the past two days... Jesus, this sux, why have i fallen in love again??!! my inner struggle

      ...life is so damn miserable  the past just keeps on coming back at u, u think it never stops, and finnally when it seem like it stopped, it jus comes back rite at you again, over and over...  in my younger years, i was a immature kid, love, was something mysterious, something, unknown to me, and probably wrongfully defined by myself...  i met a girl, she was, smart, innocent and pure. and probably also viewed love as a somewhat mysterious thing, searching, and dreaming...  we came together, we talked, and we possibly loved  one day, i did something, something that would hurt her, something that could break her heart  i was not aware what i was doing, i was a immature kid, but i did do it, i was guilty of the action i took, cant deny that part  so she left me, so she was apart from my life..  the shittiest part is that I DID NOT REALIZE HOW DEEP DEEPLY I LOVED HER, I DID NOT REALIZE HOW MUCH, truth is, i might not have realized i loved her.  if i realized it in time and confessed to her, i might've rescued this relationship... only if i could go back in time and beat the shit out of the younger me and tell him that 'u love her very much and u should confess to her!!'  now, she is so distant from me, she doesn' talk to me, i'm completely out of her life, and it seem like reaching for the moon when i try to get a grasp of her life...it'll never be the same, because i've broken her heart  i know that, i don' deserve her to be with me anymore, all i want, is to b able to communicate with her, care for her, and most of all, protect her...  she was the right girl, at the wrong time...

      Do you not know? Have you not heard?  The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth.  He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom.  He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.  Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall;  but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength.  They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary,  they will walk and not be faint.  Isaiah 4o:28-31  These verses are amazingly encouraging, Hallilujah~~~~

      IT'z 1.14am, half asleep, but cant fall asleep, 17 yearz of ups and downs, from a little baby learning how to talk and walk, to the man i am today, it'z been rough, it'z been narrow, it'z been fun. growing up is amazing, one blink of the eyes and the world changes, sometimes i feel like a time traveller, mayb because i'm constanly lost in the concept of time and occationally bounces back into reality and realize a day, a week, a month and even years has been past, it sounds weird and scary, but sometimes that's how it is.   Life, an unpredictable journey, not knowing where you will end up, hope and faith, plus a constant and determined goal is all that's keeping us going forward, along this journey, we will meet some friends, make some enemies, diss some people, be dissed by some people, love and be loved. in the end, we look back, and we will say, that was my life, and i enjoyed it  I'm wondering, what will the world be like without the concept of time. when time does not matter, when ppl can stay in their prime as long as they want, and move on when they feel like it. An old man, a wise man, once told me, the process of growing old is an extraordinary experience. i wonder why.. guess it will only be revealed by actually experiencing this process. "when time does not matter" is that what heaven is like? eternal life, that must mean when the concept of time does not exist. then what do people do in heaven everyday? would it be boring? i mean it would sure be exciting to live by God, but when does it end? what so ever i think God has it all planed right, so no 1 will get bored. another anticipating experience awaits.

      The following content is taken from Family.ca I just had to post it after reading it ------> Radio Free Roscoe Drama Series 2002 Colour 30 MINS C8      Nathan Stephenson, Ali Mukaddam, Kate Todd, Nathan Carter Radio Free Roscoe follows the lives of four diverse and quirky teenagers living in the fictitious suburban town of Roscoe. Determined to pave their way at Henry Roscoe High School, Robbie McGrath, (Nathan Stephenson), Ray Brennan (Ali Mukaddam), Lily Randall (Kate Todd) and Travis Strong (Nathan Carter) launch an anonymous underground radio station where they voice the hopes, fears and confusion of their generation. For these teens, everything is changing way too fast: their bodies, their interests, their friends and the expectations placed on them. It is also a time in their lives when anything seems possible, including falling in love with your best friend, or your worst enemy.  Empowered by the anonymity of their on-air identities, Robbie, Ray, Lily and Travis go from being foot soldiers in high school’s “silent majority” to cult heroes whose thoughts and opinions make a difference. During the day, they are trapped in the maze every ninth grader faces, but after school they only have to flip a switch and their fears of not saying the right thing, not wearing the right thing, not being the right thing all disappear. Their radio show gives them the freedom to play the type of music they want to hear and talk about the topics that are important in their lives. It is also a place to laugh at life and sometimes themselves. Whether it’s a satirical look at life at Henry Roscoe High or a cutting impersonation of their Principal, these kids know that comedy can sometimes reach the most sceptical of audiences.   Their daily radio show, called “Radio Free Roscoe,” is free from advertising, free from hype, free from hypocrisy, it is the place where these amateur DJ’s find their own identity. Daily, they meet head-on the stress of conforming to a crowd that demands that they be like everyone else: Radio Free Roscoe is about being a teenager, growing up and knowing you’re not alone.

       "It's all you'll ever hear: Look like this, think like this, be like this, how do you fight it? we started our own radio station. We keep our identities secrete, it gives us the power to say what we want, as loud as we want."  This is the intro to the TV show "Radio Free Roscoe" i recently discovered This is by far the most relative and meaningful TV show i've encountered. It actually has a very good depict of the modern teenagers' highschool life, trying to fit in, peer pressure, crushes between friends, confessions, rejections, broken hearts, understandable friends, you name it.   Basically, there are 4 students, 3 guys and 1 girl, 2 guys and 1 girl have been the best of friends since they were little, and there is the new/silent/mysterious/smart/cool guy. They felt the need for their voice to be heard, and peer pressure is crushing in, so they lauched an underground radio station where they voice the hopes, fears and confusion of our generation.  It's a great show and i enjoy watching it, if you are interested, tune in Family, weeknights 7:30pm and Midnight, Radio Free Roscoe  For more information, please visit: http://www.family.ca/

      I made a mark on my arm last night, as a reminder of the things i shouldn't have done in the past, a recent event, and to remind myself to study hard, i needed some physical pain.   I surprised myself, wonder since when did I turn so psychopathic...  Frankly, this was not a bad experience, it gave me a better understanding of life, though it was way less fatal than a suicide cut, it took a lot of courage to make the cut, especially when i chose the wrong knife...  First i rubbed on some antibiotics, to make sure i don't get an infection afterwards.  The knife i chose was a really bad knife, it's a peeling knife for fruits and vegetables. when i was choosing between a meat cutting knife and this one, i thought, it's knife, any of them should cut, and the meat cutting knife apeared to be very scary, so i chose the other, which was a bad choice. When i finally had enough courage to slice, the knife wouldn' cut, i had to cut 4 or 5 times, in the end, i closed my eyes and used all my strength to make the cut till the point i was sweating.  At the point there wasn't much blood, and i didn' feel much pain either, maybe because i was pretty tense at the time.  After a few minutes, i felt a bit sick, so i lied in my bed, then i started to shake for some reason..  After this experience, I gained better understanding of the people who commits suicide by cutting their vines. Although commiting suitcide itself is an act of foolishness and weakness, but people who died by cutting their wrist must took an increditable amout of courage and determination, they must've been through a lot of pain and sufferings in their lives, to the point where to die is better than to live.  I don't encourage anyone to do what i did, but if for wutever reason u decided to to this, here are some tips: 1. choose a really sharp knife 2. close your eyes when u do the cut

      Yesterday I watched 'The day after tomorrow', it was a movie that depicts how fragile and insignificant us human are. Also it's a remainder for us, that we shouldn't pollute the Earth as if there is no concenquence.  Troy, awesome movie, one of the best ancient war movies ever produced. It depicts Achilles, an arrogant, rebellious and seemingly invincible warrior who was doomed to fall in the pursuition for love.

      (A short essay I wrote in Grade 9 English)  What's Love? It's like the wind, no one knows when it comes, and no one could predict when it's leaving. When it comes, you can not hide from it, when it leaves you can not stop it... Love itself is precious and sweet, when two are in love, they care about each other, they adore each other for who they are, they would do whatever it takes to make one of the other happy, even death couldn't stop love, but sometimes love can be tough... Especially when its left you, you'll feel alone and lost, you'll find yourself lying upon the ground, and searching for an answer you can never find - 'why?'   There are plenty of love stories, and you can see there's something in common, most of them ends up with sadness and broken hearts... The one I'm about to introduce began in the summer of 1999...   Chris, a handsome 15 years old teenager whose parents got divorced when he was 12, lived with his father since. Chris likes to play basketball, soccer, swimming and rollerblading ect. An all round athlete type of boy.   This summer, Chris decided to spend his summer break back in his hometown - Wilstead. One day, Chris was swimming in the lake, enjoying the beauty of nature; he saw a girl surfing, looks like she's a beginner, because her movement is not very smooth. Chris was shocked, because he can see a big wave coming at the girl, and she was surfing in the restricted area because there are rocks all around. Suddenly, the big wave hit the girl, she fell into the water...   Chris knows that the girl couldn't take the big wave, so he swam over to rescue her... When he got there, the girl was drowning, and her head hit on a rock ended up unconscious. Chris took her home, put medicine on her wound spot, and let her rest, fortunately, its just skin, the rock did not damage the bones.   For a while, Chris was totally attracted by the&nbsp;beauty of the girl, she looked like an angel, with blond hair, godly face...   The second day morning, the girl woke up; Chris told her what had happened to her, she said thank you, but started to cry...   The girl's name is Jennifer, earlier yesterday her boyfriend had broke up with her because he was in love with someone else, she was very sad, didn't know what to do, so she went to surf... She was going to choose death, so didn't care about the big wave, but now Chris rescued her, she doesn't know what to do or say...   "What's wrong? Why are you crying? What's your name?" asked Chris.   "I'm Jennifer, my boyfriend just left me yesterday, I didn't know what to do, so..." Answered Jennifer.   "Oh... I see. Well, same thing had happened to me too, but I have learned to deal with it." said Chris.   "But... Ouch..." Her head started to hurt, so Chris helped her to lie down to rest.   For the next two weeks, Chris took care of Jennifer, eventually they have built undeniable friendship, both of them have fell in love with each other!   Chris and Jennifer started dating, they have taken care of each other very well, both of them never felt like that for anyone before, is this faith? Are they meant to be together? Until late that summer, both of them know that their holidays are about to end, both of them are going back to where they came from... How are they going to do that? Live without their loved ones, is that a possible thing to do?   Chris decided that for now, they will go back to where they belong, and next summer, both of them will try to move to Wilstead and go to school there, so both of them left with hope.   During the year, they have e-mailed each other very often, talked on the phone a lot too, everything seem to be fine, until one day...   Chris was planning to go see Jennifer during Christmas holidays, his phone rang...   "Hello?"   "Chris, it's Jennifer, I think that we haven't see each other for too long..."   "I know, I'm planning to come over during Christmas Holidays!" Chris said instantly.   "No, I mean, we haven't seen each other for a long time now, things don't seem to be working out between us, because of many problems."   "What do you mean?"   "Don't you understand? Anyways, I'm in love with this other boy, his really cute, and you know? I'm sorry, because we haven't seen each other for too long, I don't think thing swill work out between us..."   "...You mean you want to break up with me now? After all that we have been through you want to end this?"   "Well, basically, yes."   "But.."   Jennifer hung up the phone before Chris could finish his sentence...   That's about the end of the story, you see? That's when love left Chris, was that predictable? No, it wasn't. In a way, the love you get is never free, if you had too much love at once, you will end up bad, like one of the phrase said - The higher you climb, the harder you fall.

      these days are crazy~~~ I havn't really studied much, most of the time i went out with my friends and chill,&nbsp; i made a lot of friends during this past week, but most of them are over 20 years old.  &nbsp;  In Toronto, there is not much night life, because most of the stores closes at around 9 o'clock, after 10, or 11pm, there's so little ppl on the streets.  &nbsp;  But that doesn't mean there is no night life, if you have a bunch of friends, you can go to the bar and have some drinks, go to the kareoke to sing some songs, go to the clubs to dance, or go bowling, play pool and so on.  &nbsp;  for me, i'm only 17, it's considered under age, so i could not go to the bar, kareoke or go to the clubs, those are for people who are 19+.  &nbsp;  so these past few days i've been out with a bunch of friends, have BBQs, or go out and eat, we usually eat from 9 to 12, lol, ya, because we were chatting for&nbsp;most of the time. then we go play some pool, then go home.  &nbsp;  so my mom's kinda pissed at me because i come home after 1 or 2am everyday.  &nbsp;  gotta&nbsp;do some studying...

      Life is rough, thus i have to be tough, tears are worthless, a sign of weakness In order to protect myself, i have to arm myself with heavey armors, and stone helmets  Where am I? Who am I? These days has been cruel, I havsn't been able to show my feelings to anyone in the longest time.  I feel all my friends are so far away from me, no one understands me, what's the point of showing the real me, it'll only ruin their happy days.  Friends say they are always there, up and downs, happy or sad. but who really wants to know other people's problems? Everyone got their own to deal with. The world is frustrating, not for me, but for all of us. In the end, we are all worn out, without a vision, without any hopes The armors gets heavier every moment you live, soon no one knows who you really are, cuz you are covered up in a blob of armor which you called protection..  i find myself with many facades, the true self is a stranger even to me. who are you jack? I don' know, who am i?

      Everything we do, everything we don't do, it all relates back to decisions.  We are constantly making decisions, everyday, every minute, even every second of our lives. When should I get up today? What should I eat for breakfast? What should I wear today? Who should I talk to?  our future depends on these little decisions that we are constantly making, one can say your life has been planed out by God, every step of the way was meant to be. Others say that you make your own future, the decisions you make forms your future bit by bit.  I don't know if any of you has watched The Butterfly Effect. It's about a guy who can go back in time, every time he goes back, he changes something, and his whole future resulted in a completely different way.  For every action taken, their will be a reaction, that's one of the most common laws of Physics. Many say it is the same with things you do in life, every action will result in a reaction. But I'd like to challenge that. I think many actions taken will result in various reactions. Short term reaction, and long term reaction.  For example, if a boy's father treated him badly when he was a kid, abused him, constantly being angry at him. The short time reaction would be, the kid might cry at the moment due to the abuse, he might start to fear his father, or become mentally ill. What's the long term reaction? The kid grows up, got married, had kids, he would probably treat his son the same way his father did him. Because he automatically perceives that's the way to solve that problem, because that's what his father did.  Every decision we make might directly or indirectly influence our future. Should I take that job? Should I be friends with that guy/women?  so people, make your decisions wisely :)
