        Oh,  Adam , you're so fine, Your personality blows my mind, I loved you in the movie Grind, I wish you were mine, mine, mine.  Oh,  Adam , I love you so, You would look cute with a fro, Put me on a little show, To you, I could never say no.  Oh,  Adam , your face was sent from above, Your eyes are filled with the purest of love, You have the beauty of a graceful dove, Put on your sexy rubber gloves!  Oh,  Adam , please say my name, Hold me close, and keep me sane, Keep me away from all the pain, Maybe make out with me in the rain?  Oh,  Adam , I have to go, But all I really want you to know, Is that I'll always love you so, I'll always love you,  Adam Bro .      I wrote that. I bet it makes you want to have an orgasm.

      This probably isn't a good time to go into keeping track of all of my thoughts, as I'm drugged up from like the 20 Advils I took today for my cramps. And my cramps hurt really bad, too, so it's not like I can only concentrate on this. I've been clenching my stomach all day. But anyway, I have to get this out, and it might be really disorganized and stuff, but here it is.  Well, lately I've been thinking about  the way people think.  My mind, itself, doesn't understand the way most people think. Namely, boys. What the hell is going on in there? Wait, no, don't tell me. Hold on, I'll demonstrate.  *Start Boy Mind*    Italic and blue   = The mind of the boy.  Bold  = Girl talking to him    Seeexxxx...mmm...boobies...sex. Maybe she'll have sex? I can touch her boobs then.    Yeah, so Joe (or Bob, George, whatever his name is)...I had to cancel our plans for the movies, because...   Mmm, movies? Making out? Sex. Sex in the back row. And then more sex. Sex? Sex!!! Ooh wow, she has boobs...   Um, Joe? Are you mad at me? You're looking at me like you can't believe I'm cancelling...I mean, I'm sorry, but I have to...   Wow, her boobs are giant. MMMmmm...I could have sex with her and then break her heart so I can have sex with someone new and exciting! Seeexxx...   Okay...so anyway, I'm really sorry. But you can babysit with me, if you want.    I can have sex with a baby if I want? Oh my god!!! This is a dream come true. Wow, but babies don't have boobs...do they even have vaginas? Sex...      *End Boy Mind*  It's probably true. I might be overexaggerating a little, but I doubt it. I seriously think this is about it.  On the other hand, guys are so  stupid.  I mean, seriously. If you like them, they don't like you. And why not? If sex is all they think about, wouldn't they like you back just so they could have their chance? Everytime I like a boy, he doesn't like me, and everytime a boy likes me, it's because I don't like them. If I start liking them back, thats it. Operation I Want To Date Katie dies off, leaving me with a broken heart and no one.  What the fuck is up with that though? I don't get it. I think I should stop liking boys altogether. Oh, wait, another Boy Mind session is coming on...I can feel it...  *Start Boy Mind*    What? Stop liking boys? Yes! Yes! LESBIAAAAN!!! Oohhh, some girl tongue on girl tongue action, thats what I want, man...sex!!! YES!! THEY MUST HAVE SEX!!!...and I can join! And we can have a threesome! And sex! Sexxxxx!! Omg, the boobs! They will rub against each other and I will be a horny fucking idiot watching it all while drool comes out of my mouth and I stttaaaaaaaaaaareee!!! SEXXXXXXX.      *End Boy Mind*  Um. Okay. So that ending part was more me getting angry and having him basically call himself an idiot, but I think you get what I mean.  But anyway, thats not what I meant. I didn't mean to become a lesbian. Yuck. Girls are not my cup of tea. Even though I hate tea. But I don't like girls. Not that way. What I meant was that I would  wait.  I would wait for some guy to come to me. Stop telling guys I like them. It only screws things up.   What the hell. Sorry. I'm really in a bad mood.      On a final note:   BOYS ARE STUPID.

      I wrote a letter to Meg Cabot today. Well, no, not a letter. An e-mail. I realized that the things I wanted to say were adding up and I might as well do something about it. Well, here it is.    Hey, Meg!    How are you? Well, for the past few weeks I've had a few things to say, but haven't because I don't want to clog your inbox (or whatever it is your mail goes to). But now that I have more than one thing to say, I might as well.    First of all...thank you for posting in your diary that your last name is pernounced Cab-itt. My mom and I fight about that practically every day (She goes, 'Oh, your reading Meg Cab-Oh again...' just about every day, and I go, 'No, mom, I'm reading Meg Cab-itt books.' And she's like, thats not how you say it). Anyway, I'm glad that now I can prove her wrong, hehehe... Nextly, it's awesome that your birthday is on February 1st, because mine is on the 2nd. There are other people born that close to me or directly on my birthday, but nobody I actually LIKE. So I'm all giddy and stuff that we're birthday sistas.    And the last thing I wanted to say was that I know some people write bad stuff about your books (I.E. Oh my god, Jen is way too nice! or Jen is way to mean! or Don't always write about hot guys...etc), but don't let it get to you (even though I know you haven't)! You're a wonderful writer and nobody should tell you otherwise because they're wroooong. You're amazing!    The only one thing in the whole wide world that I don't like about you is that you don't like Nicholas Sparks books. Or Robert James Wallace. Those are both very talented authors as well and deserve a little bit more than that, especially from a fellow author. But I still love you!       Your #1 fan,             Katie      I love to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas...   I can't wait to see Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. Even though it has nothing to do with the books, I still can't wait. It comes out on Friday. Woop woop!

        Thomas Matthew     Tom  you are my hero The way you get up on stage Your voice makes me feel like more than a zero  If I never meet you I will  go on a rage .    Hurley , yeah that's your favorite brand You want to fuck a dog in the ass Upon your ass is where   I   want to lay my hand I wish for show and tell I could bring you to class.  Your voice and  music  inspires me When I sleep you are what I dream Your smile and perfect teeth fill me with glee If I ever saw you in  naked in a wheelchair  I'd scream  I love the way your  hair  falls in your eyes Sometimes you hold it to the side with gel   I   want   you  to  lay   your   hands   on   my    thighs  for me to meet you I'd go through  hell .  Looking at you and hearing your voice is orgasmic You make me all hot and wet If you ever had a  bo  ne  r  I'd ask to touch your  dick  And  Ava she will grow up and be great so don't fret .   Your wife is the luckiest person ever I wish I could be the one you  kiss  goodnight If you asked me if I would ever hurt you my answer is never For you a million bulls I  would  fight .  I love you  Tom  this is no lie I want to stand in front of you and  gaze into your eyes  Knowing that you will never be mine makes me cry If you ever needed one I'd let you have my hair tie.  I don't want to sound like  every  girl out there But its hard not to when  everyone  wants you  Now  I see why  everyone  says life's not fair All I know is that my love for you is sincerely true.   Okay, so I admit it. I didn't write this poem. But the person who did most be my friggin' clone because thats exactly how I feel about Tom Delonge. If you don't know who he is you have major issues and you're a loser.      In other news...

      Hello! How is everyone doing today?  Just so you know - I've already got a  livejournal , an  Open Diary , and a  Xanga , but I've decided to try something new as well.  It's gonna be    c  r a z   y  , and I'm almost  positive  that I won't come back to update this, but I'm giving it a try. I'm going to use it for my views on things, not for telling about my day.  To start off, I'm going to list  20 random things  about me.   I'm really shy, but there are ways you can contact my outgoing side.  I'm easily annoyed.  I'm all for making new friends, but there are certain kinds of people that I just cannot tolerate. These people include: Smokers, alcoholics, drug users, those pro-teenage-sex, and people who make me uncomfortable. Theres probably others, but I'm tired.  I love to read. Especially books that I relate to. But I'll read anything from Sci-Fi to romance.  I'm overly organized. Everything has to be just in it's place or I'm not happy.  I am overweight, but not nearly as much as I was in late December. I actually succeeded in my New Years resolution and have already lost over 20 pounds.  Speaking of reading (Random Fact #4), I found  urlLink www.blogger.com  because I was reading Meg Cabot's diary, on HER site,  urlLink www.megcabot.com .  I've had  six  boyfriends, but three of them were internet boys, so they don't count.  I like to think that I'm smart, kind,  down-to-earth , and I have a great sense of humor, but I'm sure that comes across as way conceited. So when I talk to people, I never say what I like about myself, which are those qualities.  I love to go shopping, but only if I have money. Otherwise I feel sorry for myself because I can't have all of those wonderful things.  I have a gorgeous cat named Whiskers. He's getting old. I also have a turtle named Patrick.  My best friends are  Julie ,  Ashley , and  Jennifer .  Theres a staff day (no school) on February 2nd for this coming school year, the same day that happens to be my birthday. It's those kind of things that keep you going with your Christian faith (which I have). (BTW- That was like three things about me in one, eh?).  My favorite movies are: The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Win a Date with Tad Hamilton.  My favorite books are: The Guardian, A Bend in the Road, the 1-800-Where-R-You series, and the  Princess Diaries  series.  Writing is fun. I have two books underway right now, and quite a few already finished. The ones I have underway are called "Discovering Each Other," and "Her Secret Wish."  Music & Laughter are my best medicine. Reading &amp; Writing are my escape.  I love a good cry. Sometimes people tell me that I cry too much, but what do they know? I barely cry in public and I only cry when something really touches me (positively or negatively). And theres nothing wrong with crying, anyway. So *Sticks out tongue*  I love to float in the pool for hours.  I am me. If you don't like it, don't read this.
