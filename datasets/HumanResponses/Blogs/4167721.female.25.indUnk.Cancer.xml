						   I had an interesting weekend to say the least.  Thursday night I found out that it was possible to travel back to Rochester for one day.  Yes, I said one day.  Some may think that I fell of my rocker on that decision - but no, I had it well thought out.  There was a gathering at my cousin Chris's new house to celebrate his new house and his girlfriend Terrie’s 30th birthday.  That was a gathering I really didn't want to miss.  Friday morning the alarm goes off at 4 so I can get ready for work and make sure I have all my stuff together for my quick trip to NY.  I worked that morning from 6 to 2:30 and then I hit the road.  I ended up getting to Rochester at 10 that night.  Needless to say, I was a bit tired.  That next morning, mom and I were up around 7 for coffee talk with my aunt and uncle.  Then it was off to get ready for a busy day.  I stopped into both Chase-Pitkin’s (Pittsford and Henrietta) then I went to Grandma's to meet up with her and my mom.  By that time it was party time!  Maybe five minutes into arriving at Chris's new house I hear my mom screaming my name from the basement.  I go running down to see her with tears in her eyes and Terrie standing next to her.  Mom motioned for me to look at her hand, and so I did.  Then I became the jumping idiot when I saw a ring on her finger.  Terrie is now and will permanently be part of this family.  Well we always considered her family - but now it will be official!  I couldn't have come back to better news!!  I just wish them the best of luck with all life’s adventures.  They sure make a great team!  Congratulations guys!  The next morning, it was up at 6:30 to hit the road to I could work until 12:30 that night.  One last long day to end a perfect weekend!

						    The week was an interesting one, and it is coming to an end.  I had some visitors at the beginning of the week - it was nice to see my CP (Chase-Pitkin) friends but there is always one guy that is brought that can take a hike!  Besides that, the rest of my week was work.  I feel as if I am starting to fill my roll as a Team Lead.  Cashiers are coming to me when they need to vent.  I won't let them call it complaining - I tell them if they don't say something, how are to know what needs to be fixed.  I have spent most of my week taking notes on ways to improve the department.  On the flip side of work - I have been given the opportunity to make a bulletin board informing people (mainly co-workers) who the Service Team Leaders are and what our purpose is.  I have spent the past couple nights working on that, since I myself am still learning what my job fully entails.  So far, it has been a good project - but I am still doing the homework behind it all...it can only get better!

						    At work - the whole theme is  WHO WE ARE.    Who We Are gives us five key words to live off of, and we have to try to live them every day.  I have been at Wegmans in Virginia for two months now, and I am finding that living those five words makes your relationship with your co-workers and your customers all the better.  I have tried to be there for each person I work with, even if it is just saying hello to them at the start of each day, smiling, and saying goodbye before they/I leave.  I am mentioning this because I went on vacation and when I came back - a bunch of cashiers greeted me ever so nicely.  They thought that I had left for good, and was glad to see I was back.  Now I get hugs when I get to work and hugs when I leave.  When I need a favor, I have people that are willing to give the extra hand because they know I care.  I will have to admit - I was unsure of working and team leading 15 and 17 year olds - but now they make me smile just as much as I make them smile.  Having that at work makes it a 10.  I have a family there - and to know that you are home when you step into work speaks thousands for me!
