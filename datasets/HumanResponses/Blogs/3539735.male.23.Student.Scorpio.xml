      Do you ever feel that the self is buried in our unconcious, and that the purpose we attribute to our actions is a fanciful rationalization? That's what I felt today after my drunken girlfriend started kissing me in the entryway to our friends' house. Her breath reeking of cheap red wine. "Sure, honey. I don't mind if you stay at the party." What do I get? Why do I stay? Why do I keep offering more? I felt that same sort of eerie alienation a couple days ago when thinking about my future. I have to find something to do with the rest of my life. It's getting harder every day to switch course, and it's not merely psychological: the committment of time, money, energy and the promises I make all hold me to one direction. Yet despite this committment, I couldn't tell you (or myself) what values are most important to me. No - I could  tell  you. I could tell you that equality, compassion, and respect for the earth are what motivate me. Unfortunately, I wouldn't believe myself. I wouldn't even know if I was speaking the truth. What if true self-understanding is the understanding of an absence of self? I feel like I'm looked within myself and found emptiness, and am left with nothing to look to beyond that emptiness. As much as I would like to see this as a mental illness, depression, whatever, I'm worried that the reason I keep coming back to it is because it  is  the truth. Nothingness is the truth: it's what we come from, what we are (mostly) and what we will return to. I don't see this perspective as necessarily bad. I'm familiar with the arguments, the pragmatism defense, the lengths people can go to in order to give their lives meaning. I even know the joy of it.  I'm not depressed, or if I am, I have never  not  been depressed. Maybe I see through the cloth, understand the illusion, and am a lesser person for it.  Soon enough, my girlfriend will come home drunk, and I'll pretend to be asleep so she'll leave me alone. Maybe she's the problem... that would be easier for me. If someone should accidentally read this, please don't give me your pink optimism. You don't go blind from staring too much into the dark. Staring at the sun is another matter.

      where having a generic name means  google invisibility .   How will I ever be famous if 400 other people share my name?  There's no reason society has to be organized this way. The injustice!

      I was betrayed by technology. First, by the strange setup required for my DSL connection. Secondly, by the failure of a website that contains forms that I need to download. Thirdly, by the hour I spent getting a friend's computer to function again. Ba!

      The machine rubbed against my leg and purred. I respect it for burying its shit in the sand.  You may object to me calling it a machine. It doesn't care, so fuck you.  No need to shout about what it is or isn't, right? A cat has four legs, a tail, black ears and black face, greying, a sagging belly that should sway when she walks graceless thumping steps across our wrought-iron coffee table. What we know or don't  won't change it (right?).  My eyes are cat detectors: the itch just beneath the lower lid: my eye: another machine. Filled with tears. Itchy. Sees more than cats, but feels them, most acutely.   I lost a friend today. She had been sick - sicker than seemed right. Her sleekness became ragged; something was eating her inside. When I took her in it was cancer, of course. She asked me to look after her cat.

      How do the little people manage? Do they use the same password for everything? It takes me three tries before I can remember the right one for half the shit I'm signed up for. They tell you not to use the same password for everything, but when you use multiple access points it becomes tedious pretty quickly to remember them all.

      I'm just experimenting with blogger, so please forgive my pathetic blog. Yes, yes, your blog is much better than mine. You are a cultured, witty, penetrating author who is widely respected in the blogging community. I'm a hopeless wannabe.  Now fuck off.
