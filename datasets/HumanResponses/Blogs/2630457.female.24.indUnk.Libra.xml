      i hope i spelled her name correctly...you'd think if you love someone you'd know how to spell their name, huh??  there is a song (#6 on the new Fallen cd) that i cannot stop listening to. i would assume it was written about a person, but i can't listen to it w/out thinking about God...  this is the chorus:  you stay the course you hold the line you keep it all together you're the one true thing i know i can believe in...  you're all the things that i desire you save me you complete me you're the one true thing i know i can believe...  i want to write songs like that - straight from the heart.

      i have a whole lot going on and i don't feel like typing it all...  i'm not avoiding you because i don't love you...i'm avoiding you because it always takes a lot out of me to deal w/ everything that is said...i need at least an hour to sit and talk...i'm a horrible friend.  i'm sorry.  things are crazy...i am a complete contradiction.  you know that whole last post several days ago about tyler and it fizzling...well, it's not fizzling.  he went to oklahoma and spent some time w/ family and came back ready to quit drinking and getting high all the time.  (yes, he's said that before).  but the past few days have been great.  no alcohol, no weed.  very honest and easy-going and i get to see him again the way he really is.  and i really like him.  but don't worry too much...things change regularly.  so who knows?  i hate working at a bank.  i'm not sure what my destiny is...what prosperous plan God has for me.  i wish that i could just live a dream life.  my dream life has many different facets.  i would travel all over the place.  i would keep in touch w/ so many people.  i would be a leader - i would affect people (actually God would affect them through me).  i would do things like ride in a hot air balloon.  i would meet w/ women and kids in prison.  i would live near the ocean.  i would be outdoors all the time.  i would spend time helping out at a homeless shelter.  i would paint.  i would make things.  i would try new things.  i would read new books...the list goes on and on.  i know i can do some of those things now but...whatever.  i can't escape the reality that none of that matters in the long run.  well...maybe some of it.  i haven't gone out "drinkin" since new year's eve.  and that's kind of a long time when compared to the past 6 months of my life.  i didn't realize it, but i was going out to a bar w/ friends at the very least once a week...weird.  i don't know why or if i'm running.  why is there a plan for me?  for anyone?  that should be comforting but it's scary.  i think it's a control thing.  mark's grandmother died.  i wonder how that will affect the church.  she actually totally supported mark and would apparently invite her friends' grandkids to come to connect because it's actually a pretty cool church.  and it is.  i just don't know where i fit in there.  i'm starting to think maybe i don't.  not in a negative way...just realizing that there's gonna be more to my life than what's here.  i think i've been saying that for the past year.  i think about virginia a lot.  more than i care to really.  i miss some of the people.  i don't miss who i was.  i'm sad when i think of who i was.  i miss ken.  i miss the way he would say a whole lot w/ just a few words...or sometimes even just the look on his face.  it was frustrating and sometimes just damn annoying.  but i still miss the way that he teaches people about life.  i wonder if he ever remembers me.  and even though i hate to admit it, i wonder about jason every now and then.  i just wonder what kind of person he is.  if he's still the same.  if he loves his wife the way he should.  if their baby is ok.  i wonder why i had to meet him.  usually i say that i wouldn't change a lot of stuff...that i am who i am because of everything i've chosen and/or experienced...but i think i would change that.  i would change him in my life.  OK...can't handle that anymore.  i also miss jay and patrick and mike.  they affected me more than i knew.  and now i'm crying.  i'll write again soon...

      so it's night again...  i had a pretty good day.  just to update:  you'll be happy to hear that tyler has pretty much decided to smoke weed and get ridiculously drunk ALL THE TIME and while i'm pretty laid back about doing his own thing, it gets really old to be blown off over and over just so he can get jacked up to not deal w/ his issues.  and it's worse when he gets mean and confrontational...it's just not pretty.  so that is fizzling very quickly.   i would really like to figure out how to remove those weird "edit me" links on the side...i'll have to do some looking...  something that made me happy today:  the comedian emailed me a good email.  it reminded that yes, we did in fact have some sort of connection and he definitely understands me more than most do (yeah, even after only a few days of talking 24/7).  he's very very cool.  and i'm sure that it will just be a friendship - and that will be good.  he makes me smile.    i don't have anything deep to talk about tonight.  it requires too much effort.  i'm gonna go take a steamy hot shower and use my victoria's secret shampoo and conditioner...it also makes me smile.  :)  monica, i love the massage therapy idea.  i checked into the school right around here about 2 years ago.  a friend of mine just finished and i think it's an awesome idea!  yes, it does suit you.  i miss you so much and i'm trying to find a time to come visit soon.  god seems far away.  i  know  he's not...but i can't feel him.  or rather, i don't want to yet.  goodnight world.

      ok...so i'm back in the blogging world.  and this time it shouldn't be a bitter tribute and/or a play-by-play of everything my ex-boyfriend is doing...i mean, after all he's married now w/ a kid on the way and i have so much more going on in my life now...  God has a funny way of keeping life moving.  even after your whole world has come to a screeching halt.  so...here i am, continuing life.   alone yet surrounded by people.   confident yet clueless as to who i am. seeking answers but standing still. listening while i cover my ears.  my life feels all mixed up. i know all the right things to say...but i don't want to be about that. i never have wanted to be about that. i'm at my best when everything is original...i think we all are.  so we'll see how real i can be on here...

      it's late again. i don't have to much to say right now. just wanted to check in w/ this place and say that i'm okay.  things aren't bad right now. still trying to figure everything out. i've had some good times lately.  learning to live life in "moderation". i can see things better that way. not sure what i'm looking for, but searching all the same.  it's gonna be alright. He knows me.  He sees me.  He loves me.

      well i'm unexpectedly feeling down...  first, a friend from high school called - actually he's called a couple of times wanting to hang out while he's in town... and i   want   to hang out w/ him, but the thought of lighting candles and listening to sad songs and sipping wine ALONE just sounds so much better right now.  i feel like i should hang out w/ him, but i don't have any energy...so whatever.  second, i just watched the first part of the "american idol finale".  and it made me sad - or maybe not sad - just emotional.  that fantasia chick is unbelievably amazing.  and it's not even that she has the best voice ever - she's just a performer.  she appears to put heart and soul into everything she sings.  she stole the show.  i can't get over it yet.  it was incredible.   so then i get online here and check my friends' blogs and to my surprise monica has updated hers.  and it really did make me sad.  sad that "life sucks" right now.  sad that i know how she feels in a lot of ways.  sad that i haven't kept in touch the way i should.  i called her.  got voice mail.  i miss her voice - she was my best friend.  isn't it strange how people come and go in life?  you're so close to someone...so involved.  and then for different reasons - not necessarily bad ones - everything changes.  you don't talk as much.  you start having different experiences.  you put off "real" conversations because...  well honestly i don't know exactly why.  but it happens.  it happened.  and i'm sorry about that.  i am going to do some laundry.  turn up the music.  i feel lonely today - i hope a friend calls.

      ~waiting!!  waiting to get the official "you're hired".  it's seriously been like 3 weeks.  time to get a move on.  ~having no money.  it gets old.  one bill after another, ya know?  ~the guy who sits across the room from me at work. :)  ~not remembering things i say or do (guess i should lay off the alcohol).  that's all i can come up w/ for now - i'm not really in a bad mood so i'm having trouble coming up w/ things to gripe about.  but never fear...there will be some gripes to come.  can't be in a good mood forever.  i'll write later.

        someone  , who will remain unnamed, challenged me to compete with "the glory" of his website.  ridiculous.  some people are obsessed.  and he's arrogant.    cute...but arrogant.

      ok...i'm very lame for using the exact same template as my friend james... www.jamesu2.blogspot.com but i really really like it, so sorry.  nobody ever reads this thing anyway!  i hope i get this new job.  the "other woman" interviewed today - she was early so i got to meet her.  she actually even walked up to me and asked for mike - funny.  she looked very professional and i immediately starting thinking that she's got the job - and i would understand why.  who knows? we'll see.  tyler's in australia.  i miss him most of the time...unless i'm "recording a song".  later

      you've inspired me to write again as well.  it seems to be the only way we keep up with each other, huh?  i read back through the few posts that i wrote and had to give a sad little laugh because things haven't changed much in the past few months.  and i get tired of rambling on about the same ol' thang, ya know?  anyway...quick update:  i'm a teller but have applied for a different job - won't know for a week or 2.  i'm still dating tyler believe it or not (off and on it seems)...it's better but not great yet.  i have a crush on the comedian (Craig).  he was in town about a month ago and we were hangin out the entire weekend...but it's all very romanticized and i know that it's not reality.  hopefully i can consider him a friend.  i miss singing.  i like beer and vodka.  (not in the same night and not in large quantities)  my favorite color is red but i'm starting to like green.  i haven't been going to church on any sort of regular basis.  i still believe that God is real and all around and involved.  monica - if you're actually reading this, i miss you.  i miss our talks and i miss riding in the car with you.  i miss your insight and unique perspectives.  i miss your songs and your voice.  i haven't forgotten you.  don't know what else to say right now.  i love reading other blogs - there are some funny people out there in the world.  where the hell are these people and how can i get to know them??  :)

      i cannot WAIT for tyler to get home.  i miss him a lot actually.  over the past couple of nights i've watched "8 Mile" and "Moulin Rouge", both of which in my humble opinion are excellent movies...very different of course...but excellent.  got an email from craig...cool.  hey tomorrow's my last day as a bank teller - HOORAY!!!  i'm very happy to be moving over to the mortgage side and learning that business and working w/ those people - i'm expecting it to be a challenge that i will thoroughly enjoy.  i've been keeping my parents' pets at my apt this week - they're still in galveston.  and it was fun and they were cute for about 6 hours.  i love them, but they get on my nerves.  a tiny dog and a cat.  i'm sick of feeding them and letting the dog out to pee (or whatever).  good thing i don't have kids, huh?!  my "prom date from '98" called last night - woke me up.  he's getting married next weekend and wanted to make sure i would be at the wedding...i will.  i can't help but think back to high school when matt was my best friend and i couldn't imagine life beyond my own little world.  that was at least 6 years ago.  what the hell have i been doing all this time??  anyway, the movie "my best friend's wedding" came out w/ julia roberts.  and i was very emotional and dramatic at the time (can you imagine?) and i remember being horribly upset thinking that movie was a picture of mine and matt's friendship.  and he would find his girl and they would get married and i would be all alone wondering why he chose her in the end.  and here we are.  he's getting married next weekend.  and he's SO excited.  and he's so grown up.  and the only differences between real life and the movie is that:  1)need i point out the obvious...julia roberts is nowhere to be found in THIS version.    2)i'm not gonna go try to make him fall in love w/ me.  because i'm genuinely happy for him.  he's done things the right way and i love him as a person and he deserves every good thing that comes his way.  so i will be at his wedding (alone, thank you very much) and all will be as it should be.  tired...going to bed.
