      This weekend I went away to The Isle of Wight festival. As usual I built myself up to become bubbling over with excitement before I went, so as it would usually be the experience would not be as good as the idea of it. However this time, my usual experience with times I look forward to wasn't the same. I had a better time than I had imagined I would.  Usually the experience I have at festivals goes somewhat like this. Get there, set up tent, get completely plastered on anything available, come home with no real memories of what happened; only a vague idea that at some point during the weekend I managed to get a little sleep, and was possibly stood in a crowd watching a band.  This time was different. Although not without intoxicants ( including a very special Dutch beer called Oranjeboom, try it, if the name doesn't suggest enough to you the after-taste certainly should), I was actually in the right mind to be able to really enjoy the bands I saw. Especially David Bowie, who is still looking foxy at his age and who was completely amaxing!  So now I'm sat at home, very tired, wishing that i was somewhere else and that the fun would never end!!

      There are some extremely bad jobs around, but i think mine is one of the worst. True, I dont have to pick up other people's waste, clean the houses of people I take no pride in, or systematically pass food through a check out; however I dont feel that these jobs are of much less benefit than mine. The first obstacle is that I work in the evening, so on Friday and Saturday night, instead of being able to go out early and relax, i prepare for an evening at work.  Secondly, the people that I work with. It is hard to make conversation with a middle aged man who has nothing else but the pub he works in, 3 women I barley know anything about, and a landlord who comes in after having a bath in aftershave, which smells like the sort of vinegar you have had in your cupboard for months and is impossible to tell what era it actually came from. So as is imaginable the atmosphere between us all is little to be desired. Conversations consist of the weather, how the pub has run for the week when thankfully i wasn't there, and what needs to be done, the rest of the time I'm stood in an awkward silence that makes me want to grab the nearest spatula and hit myself to change the focus of staring at the floor. The work I do in itself has little perks - if any. For 3 hours of my weekend i either have my had in the most disgusting 3 minute dishwasher in the world, this dishwasher actually has things growing in it, plates go in and come out twice as dirty, nicley infected with all sorts of exotic fungus that you know the customers wont be able to wait to feel the effects of - the next day, in bed, unable to move, throwing up for hours.  The rest of the joyful time i spend in the kitchen i'm either collecting chips or cutting potatoes to put into the all time favourite appliance of every spot on your face, the deep fat fryer. This kitchen appliance is so horrible i actually dream about it for the rest of the week, the dreams finally fading until i have to go back, which makes the nightmare all the more real. And what is worse is the baskets that hold the foods sucking in oil. Being of a weak dispostion (i begin to wonder sometimes if i have muscles in my arms) i find it difficult to lift them, but what makes things worse is that i have to turn them over afterwards. Chips everywhere but in the tray they are meant to be in. So after all that effort the process just has to be repeated again. I could continue, and I will. Another exciting activity is the microwave. I cannot get my head around it. Set times for different foods, which I press into the machine. So why when i take them out again is everything completely frazzeled, or stone cold? Is it me, am i a complete idiot, or does the microwave enjoy making my evenings that little more thrilling. Quite frankly, the rest of the kitchen has already done enough. The only perk i can think of is being payed. But is Â£4 and hour enough for this hell every week. Ah well, as is life I suppose, I have next weekend off!

      I had been looking at some quotes recently and found some I wanted to publish, they should be heard!! "The time is always right to do what is right" - Martin Luther King, Jr "There is a single light of science, and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere." - Issac Asimov "I hope I never gert so old I get religous." Ingmar Bargman. "Shyness has a strange element of narcissism, a belief that how we look, how we perform, is truly important to other people."  - Andre Dubus. "I wash my hands of those who imagine chattering to be knowledge, silence to be ignorance, and affection to be art." - Kahil Gibran. "The world is so empty if one thinks only of mountains, rivers and cities; but to know someone here and there who thinks and feels with us, and though distant, is close to us in spirit - this makes the earth for us an inhabited garden."
