      We've finished three out of four days of our craniosacral class. There are about 50 people in our class, a lot of really, really good people. When I was at school and elsewhere, I felt like a bit of an outsider because it seemed I was in a place few could help me, except for the instructors. Finally, I walked into a room and for the first time, I felt like the baby in the group. It's been exhilarating, the combined energy just catapulted everyone up several levels. I suspect we're weeks to even months ahead of where we would be had we been working alone. I've also, finally, hooked into an awesome network of craniosacral therapists so hopefully, from now on, I'll be able to get more regular work done.  Prior to class, I quit most other forms of healthcare maintenance I was doing, except acupuncture. No chiropractic for three months, no rolfing for over a month, no other craniosacral work for two months; needless to say I was a wreck by the time I walked in that classroom. (The things I do in the name of research!) I'd mixed so many different modalities that when my health improved it was impossible to tell which modality or modalities were responsible for the improvement. I knew enough to know the chiropractic alone wasn't successful; moving the bones without working on the soft tissue meant I was forever going in for adjustments, with small improvements coming over the course of months with no end in sight. But I honestly didn't know if craniosacral therapy alone was sufficient, and I wanted to find that out this weekend.  Prior to class I knew enough to start practicing on myself. I tried and tried and tried to palpate my own cranial rhythms. I did get to a point where I noticed this weird undulation, but wasn't sure what it was and certainly didn't know enough to tell what direction it was going and what it was doing. I know  some people think it's a sham, and I was open enough to that being a possibility; another possible option was that I didn't have the sensitivity to palpate this. I'd seen articles rebutting the idea of craniosacral rhythms because when they did tests, practitioners couldn't seem to agree on the rhythms objectively.  First day we got in there, and luckily with the background work I did, I could at least admit I felt something. And surprisingly, about 75% of the class felt something. We have a remarkably eclectic group. Mostly LMTs, a small group still in school, two (including me) who had just passed the nationals recently, a microbiologist/violinist, computer science/pianist veteran (me), a woman who was an airline mechanic with a reputation as The go-to person for air conditioning and fuel systems, a critical care nurse, PTs, occupational therapists, etc etc.  Luckily I bring my laptop to class and take notes in real time (I've used UNIX since the mid-70's when I was in 7th grade, so I've been using vi or a pre-variant of vi since then, and between that and the piano skills I can type fast enough to keep up with conversations, certainly a lot faster than I can write). Most of my classmates are, at this point, suffering from information overload. Also, if the instructor starts spewing, the only thing they can do is put their pens down, listen, and hope they retain some of the info. I'm able to keep up. I've picked up a lot, but I've also been a lot less stressed out because if I forget anything, I know I can simply go back and read the transcripts again. But I admit I'm probably driving the instructor batty. :P She most likely thinks I'm not listening to her while she talks, but I am. And, I can look at her the entire time while I type; I never have to look at the keyboard except for occasionally to do a sanity check to make sure my hands didn't shift one key. Reading the notes is challenging enough; having to solve a cryptogram before reading the notes - no way.  My first day was a challenge; at our school we got a good foundation in the basics of massage, but nothing out there like energy work. My partner was a student at Bahkti, a school in Safety Harbor where they apparently teach you a little of everything. So her main strength was energy, but not really massage, so she didn't have good body mechanics. As soon as she leaned over me and started working on my throat area, I felt claustrophobic and had an immediate, full blown emotional reaction. It sent me back in time two years; I was mortified, after so much work, what was I doing back here?! I left class that evening, bumped around at home for awhile and slept.  When I woke up the next morning I laughed, because I realize why this had happened. Even though I haven't had any energy training I've always been aware that it's around. And since I'm not trained I've noticed things like the fact I'm a sponge who seems to pick up stuff; I'd never really learned how to protect myself and the few tips I heard I thought... uh... OK... At one point when I was asking my acupuncturist for another craniosacral referral (because the first is very busy, plus she had a heart attack in Feb), my acupuncturist made some strange comments. Two other therapists work at the same office as the therapist originally recommended, but they're not as experienced. She said of one: in a pinch you could try her. But don't try the other person; your hypersensitive energy-wise, and she doesn't have very good energy; she's very chaotic and negative. I remember leaving my acupuncturist's office scratching my head because I had no clue what she was talking about. It wasn't until I woke up the morning of the second day of class that I understood, at a visceral level, what that statement meant. It meant this stuff exists, it's powerful, and along with that power comes responsibility. Tread lightly with respect. It gives me more motivation to keep working on myself (which I have been for the last three years), now that I know how sensitive some patients can be and what it feels like to be steamrolled on an energetic level. I don't want to give them anything inadvertently, nor do I want to pick anything up inadvertently. I need to learn to be just a conduit.  The second day we covered a lot - part of a 10-step protocol that Dr. Upledger came up with to help new craniosacral therapists learn and refine their skills, while also ensuring they don't hurt patients, and actually help heal patients even if the techniques aren't done quite right. It was a bit rocky but a necessary part of the learning experience. I'd already gotten a jump start - I had my rocky experience at the end of the first day. I'm sure other students were curious to see me leave crying. The second day, half the class ended up with headaches, nausea, dizziness, several emotional responses, and the instructors ended up doing a lot of grounding and showing us how to deal with these issues. I say this is a necessary part of the learning process for students because if they don't know how powerful these techniques are, they may take too aggressive an approach with clients initially.  The payoff was more than worth it. By the end of today, we'd been working on each other, and the instructor and assistants had been working on students with particularly challenging problems. The end result was by the end of the day, EVERYONE could feel the craniosacral rhythms because they were so strong. I realized the reason I couldn't feel my rhythms for a months is because my neck and occiput was so badly jammed. The instructor fixed me by using me as a demo, and after that I could feel my own rhythms. In fact, it got to be a challenge in the end - hearing my partner's rhythms and my own at the same time, and learning to distinguish the two. We heard plenty of stories like: my eyesight got sharper! My hearing improved. Wow, you look a lot better - your skin, you're more symmetric, your eyes seem more focused. Headaches, backaches, and pain disappeared. A chronic bruise at the site of an installed steel plate disappeared practically overnight.  And the icing on the cake for me was the afternoon, when my palpation input began to jive with my partners'. We learned how to push clients into a stillpoint, then wait for their systems to start up again. When my last partner worked on me, we both felt the rhythms and felt when it started up again. The same happened when I worked on her.  Granted, this is because we've all had significant work at this point so our rhythms are strong. But someone who walks off the street probably doesn't have a good one, and after only three days I doubt any of us are good enough to detect that. I've learned I definitely have a sensitivity threshold below which I can't perceive much. And that's what we'll all be striving to improve from this point forward. Fascinating stuff!

      My dad is a retired physicist with a PhD from Cornell, so even though I myself only have a layman's understanding of physics, I enjoy reading a range of books that touch on everything from science to spiritual, trying to tie everything together. Carl Sagan's books. Paradigms Lost/Regained, The Emperor's New Mind, Briane Greene's Elegant Universe (string theory), Whitley Strieber's The Path and The Key, http://www.futureperspective.com/futpers.htm, Power vs. Force. It's become obvious from all fronts that there is far more than meets the eye, and that there seem to be numerous dimensions we can't perceive, possibly even multiverses. Time and space are an illusion, so why do we perceive time and space? Why can't we see the future? Why must we grow old, infirm, and die?  I've always looked on this universe as a giant playground, a place to explore. Then this thought occurred to me. Do we perceive time and space so that we experience what we otherwise could not?  What would happen if we didn't have time? If we could see everything all at once - past, present, and future? Would we be able to enjoy music? Or would we perceive everything all at once, one giant chaotic cacophany? Would we enjoy the dancer who floats gracefully across the stage? What about watching those sunsets? There are times we all feel constrained by time and space, we'd love to break those barriers and see beyond them. And I'm all for exploration, I feel it's inevitable. But as we seek beyond what we know, do we truly appreciate what we do have?

      Besides seeing jaw-dropping results with alternative healthcare modalities like craniosacral therapy (hence, the career switch from 16 years of IT to healthcare), the trend towards offshoring of IT was another huge factor in the switch. And not just for me; when I attended The Humanities Center in St. Petersburg, FL, the July, Sept, and Nov 2003 classes all had nearly 30 students, forcing the school to divide each class into two groups. Many in my class came from an IT background, which I think was a huge reason why more than half of our class graduated with excellence or honors. The class after me, Jan 2004,  seems to have shrunk back down to a normal size; I suppose the worst of the offshoring is over because I'm noticing companies finally realize offshoring isn't quite the silver bullet they thought it would be. Also, there is still a shortage of talented IT professionals who truly understand what they are doing, especially in the OO and AOP worlds.  I'm sure a lot of people wondered why offshoring happened: corporate greed, the fact that automation leads to replacing humans with technology, etc. Here are a couple other thoughts:  1. I worked abroad at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo back in 1996 and have kept touch with a few friends; one friend was surprised at what a far-reaching impact offshoring had on the US IT business. I asked why, and she said there had been no impact in Japan, simply because few Indians speak Japanese. Projects that are offshored require translators and that doesn't seem to work at all.  I'd always looked upon the English language as an awesome example of global glue. Our wedding in 1999 was a mini global gathering; I'm Asian, my husband's Dutch. The guests were roughly 1/3 Asian, 1/3 European, 1/3 American with a smattering of Middle Eastern, African, Canadian, and Carribean people. And yet, in spite of that variety, everyone was able to communicate with one another - in English. I'd always thought the US had an edge over continents that consisted of a multitude of countries with different languages and different cultures. Not only do you have to get your work done, you have to expend energy translating everything into different languages. What bursts of creativity are hindered because of the delay or barriers to cross-pollination in communication? But when it comes to offshoring, this has definitely bitten us in the butt. India was once an English colony, so most Indians speak English as a second language. We are literally at the mercy of anyone who is English-speaking anywhere in the world willing to work for less.  2. The healthcare crisis gives a whole new shade to offshoring. I'd always thought large corporations were greedy (and granted, they probably still are), but the cold hard fact is places like India have a national healthcare system in place. So not only are the salaries there lower, but corporations don't have to foot the bill for healthcare. When you listen to the Democratic convention and learn that Starbucks pays more for healthcare than for coffee, or Ford pays more for healthcare than for steel, then my friends, the system has failed. It's time to get off the grid (and looping back, that's another reason for the career change; I'm hoping to enable others to get off the grid). Were I a large corporation, I would be forced to make the same hard decision, for offshoring is the only maneuver that makes economic sense, given our healthcare crisis.

      Boy, a private practice today has a lot of neat options for automating the reception and appointment handling! I've been doing a little research and ran into an answering service that could set up appointments, using online appointment tools like AppointmentQuest. Very convenient for doctors, bodyworkers, etc.        urlLink http://www.answerforce.com/          urlLink http://www.appointmentquest.com/tour

      On another note, we've been in a holding pattern to build a more energy efficient home. Unfortunately, our greatest challenge seems to be finding a general contractor who isn't too busy to build our home! Tampa has been exploding in terms of development, and I suspect the construction industry is the one industry, in this region, that has never known what "recession" really means.        urlLink http://www.domega.org/     Scroll down to the Jan 5, 2004 entry, and click on the "Read More" link to see a computer mock-up of what the place will look like.  Yesterday we visited the property because it turns out we have some banana trees and they were making bananas! I'd never owned a fruiting banana tree before. When we got there, Frank said: hey, look! And Finally, for the first time, we got to see the little bugger tenant we need to treat carefully when we start construction - a gopher tortoise. There he was, in broad daylight, hiking across the lawn. I knew where his burrow was, so I quickly jumped out and ran over, and stopped him. I was surprised at how quickly he can move, I'm sure he saw me, but I got him anyway. He's quite heavy, a good 4-5 pounds. Cute little fellow! No, we didn't have a camera. Gopher tortoises are protected in Florida, and we have to capture any tortoises in live burrows on our property and relocate them elsewhere on our property before we can start construction. So after we all got a good look at him, we let him go and off he went, back in his burrow. I'm amazed the burrow is Exactly the right size for him, I don't think there was 3 millimeters to spare on either side of his shell when he scurried back in.  All in all, part of a great day that included "fishing". I say "fishing" because we're great at feeding the fish, not catching them. I don't ever remember having so much trouble catching anything in NJ when we were growing up. In fact, I have one childhood picture of my sister and I angelically smiling for the camera, along with a monstrous carp sitting in front of us. Yep, it was as big as my little sister, and she was the one who hooked it. It nearly had her for lunch. But down here, I guess it's such a tourist state and you have so many naive tourists coming in trying to fish that the fish have learned how to steal bait without getting hooked. We tried to catch mullet with bread, and kept the bait near the surface so we could see. Almost immediately when the bait goes in, you see it buffeted around wildly as the fish munch away. Within seconds it's gone, and you don't even have an opportunity to set the hook! Must be using the wrong hook... No crabs either.

      Here's an interesting link:        urlLink http://www.digitalronin.f2s.com/politicalcompass/index.html     I take Upledger's Craniosacral I class starting Thursday. I still have some work to do to prepare for this class, and I have a feeling I'm going to get snowballed. I've also stopped seeing my atlas orthogonal chiropractor for months now and my back has gone back to being a little messed up. That's because I've noticed if you mix too many modalities - chiropractic, craniosacral, rolfing, etc. you often don't know which modalities benefit you the most, and sometimes they clash with each other! Especially when you have one person trying to address a problem from one angle and another addresses the same or different problem from a different angle. Also, I've found two very good craniosacral practitioners in the Tampa area but they use two slightly different flavors. The one therapist who is the reason for my career change said Upledger uses indirect techniques, which means manipulation toward areas of greatest ease, to effect a release. Direct techniques, which she uses, mean manipulation to areas where clients don't like to move, to allow them to find a way to release. Which system works better? I don't think either because they've both worked for me, with the right practitioners. And they've both NOT worked for me, with the wrong practitioners. I do feel each technique is better suited to different situations. If I have a client who's more liable to self-heal given the chance, I might try indirect techniques. If someone is stuck and can't get out of that predicament himself, I'll try the direct techniques.  Of course each side poo-poos the other, which I think is not right. The direct therapist says: what are you going to do, just sit there waiting for something to happen? And the indirect therapist says the direct methods are too heavy-handed (which, given the right practitioner, I have not found that to be true). One thing is consistent with both practitioners (and even skilled students who have done craniosacral work on me): I fall into a deep slumber and miss everything!  I'm just thinking out loud as I begin hashing together material for my business website, TouchRelief.com. It's already up, but I'm thinking of a number of important additions. It's funny how, when you're not inspired, you could grind your gears for hours and get nothing done, no matter how hard you try. But once that pump starts to flow, it's impossible to stop it, and you have to write stuff down otherwise it stays in your head, floating around, gumming up the plumbing... I'm in the latter state right now, exhilarating since it's been awhile since I've been this inspired.  The inspiration is also coming from working on my business plan, which is shaping up nicely.

      I couldn't believe we had 19 people show up at our house to watch the Outfoxed DVD and hook in to a nationwide teleconference. What a great group of people, and it's nice knowing there's a growing outrage in this country that's snowballing into, hopefully, more voter turnout at the polls.        urlLink http://www.moveon.org/fox/     Other interesting sites:        urlLink http://www.cursor.org      urlLink http://www.airamericaradio.com/pub/globalDefault.htm

      Tomorrow, Sunday, we're hosting an "Outfoxed" party. This went from signing up on a lark in the middle of the week to suddenly having a full party of at least 15 people; we've got some work to do to reconfigure the place to fit that many people but I guess the 84" diagonal screen on our projection system did it...  The previous weekend we participated in a MoveOn.org call-a-thon in an attempt to register as many new voters as possible. Our little group registered six new voters (including the pizza guy who delivered our dinner :) - hey, you get them any way you can!) and it seems overall nationwide we registered 10,000 new voters. And that doesn't include the tons of messages we left on peoples' answering machines; I wonder what kind of effect that has? Hope they have more call-a-thons like this!  I also did most of the shopping necessary to start my new business. Found a small desk, bookcase/storage unit, filing cabinet, etc. that will all fit comfortably into a 12' x 12 1/2' room. I prefer starting off small, and I wouldn't mind staying like this for quite awhile since the executive suites I picked already have a shared reception/waiting area. The initial overhead in running a business like this (successfully) is not trivial. I also have to work on getting an establishment license and occupational license.

      As you might tell from my bio, I've been a pianist for 30+ years. I started when I was 7, and several months later entered a NJ state competition and eventually came in 3rd place that first year (you have to go through the preliminaries, semi-finals, and then finals over the course of several months). My sister gave her first concert when she was 4 1/2 years old.  My dad assumed he had two little Mozarts for daughters but it turns out that's not true. It's the method that's important, and what's interesting is that my dad was able to capture the gist of my piano teacher's techniques by watching her operate when we took piano lessons. Coupled with his background as a now retired physicist with a PhD from Cornell, and you have an online tutorial that enables others to do the same thing we did when we were children. One teenager wrote to my dad recently to follow up. He started piano lessons in Dec. 2002 using the techniques outlined in my dad's book. Three months later he entered a concerto competition hosted by his high school, and came in first place. He beat out others who had been taking lessons for 10+ years.  Here's the link to the piano book:       urlLink http://members.aol.com/chang8828/contents.htm     And here's the link to the teenager who is now more than a passable pianist; he's put his recordings online:       urlLink http://www.mtm-piano.tk/

      And now I send in the application for my State of Florida License and I'm on my way to becoming an LMT. Just in time, I have a lot to do before I can open up my office.  I think the most gratifying thing so far in switching from IT to doing this type of therapy is helping people with fibromyalgia. I have one patient who was in so much pain she was popping 4-5 Tylenol 8 hour pills each day. She came to me in tears because her mom suffered horribly before she died, and this woman didn't want to suffer the same way.  Probably one of the most devastating aspects about fibromyalgia is the fact that fibro sufferers often can't sleep, probably because of the pain. Same with this woman, she couldn't sleep, she had restless legs, etc. She would toss and turn all night. That's a real dilemma because sleep helps soft tissue to heal, so the situation quickly devolves into a vicious spiral.  Since I've worked on this woman, her pain has gone from unbearable to between good and uncomfortable. Instead of 4-5 pills a day, she now takes one when she has a flare up and feels she needs the relief. And there are a number of days now when she says "I slept like a log last night!"  I admit, I loved IT but the days I run into situations as gratifying as the one above, I am so grateful I closed my eyes, and took a leap of faith off that cliff back in 2003.

      How's that for a first post? It's an idea I've batted around for awhile privately, and now it seems others may be coming to a similar conclusion.  When journalist Bob Woodward asked the president-select if he asked his father for any advice, the response was: "He is the wrong father to appeal to for advice... There's a higher Father that I appeal to." When Woodward asked: "Well, how is history likely to judge your Iraq war?”, Bush replied: "History, we don’t know. We’ll all be dead."       urlLink http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/15/60minutes/main612067.shtml      We have assaults on our environment that may be accelerating the process of global warming, leading to potential scenarios as depicted by movies like "Day After Tomorrow".  We're close to reaching the phenomenon in time known as "Peak Oil", with no true alternative energy solutions in sight.       urlLink http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/RRiraqWar.html     is an interesting article.  We're deeply in debt, with no end in sight. Did you see the MoveOn.org TV ad "Child's Pay"?  We have war with Iraq (see the ratical article) and have, in a short time, lost the good will of a lot of countries who now rightfully view us as a rogue nation.  We have seen a precipitous slide in our rights and freedoms as Americans (Patriot Act), and the looming possibility for martial law.       urlLink http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/cahML.html     We also have the Left Behind groups who feel after the disappearance of millions, those left behind will be forced to choose sides in a spiritual battle:       urlLink http://www.leftbehind.com/     Some thought the second coming of Christ would be in 1000. Then 2000. And now we live in a world burdened with an increasing human population and dwindling resources, and why hasn't the second coming occurred already? Is it because they have not yet accomplished all of God's will by ridding the world of evil?       urlLink http://www.counterpunch.org/cook02222003.html     Americans need to arm themselves by informing themselves. We need to register to vote, and hit the polls in November. And we need to ensure that the election results are not stolen again by companies like Diebold. Otherwise, we may be facing irreparable destruction.

      Not much of an aftermath for those of us in the Tampa, St. Petersburg, and Clearwater areas, thankfully. However, Punta Gorda and other smaller towns were devastated. We really dodged a bullet.  This jarred me (although I suspect, nowhere near as much as it jarred Punta Gorda) - we'd all been expecting a cat 2 or 3 hurricane hitting Tampa Bay. Instead, Charley intensified shortly before landfall into a cat 4, possibly borderline cat 5. For about a half an hour to an hour, we sat slackjawed in front of the TV, feeling a bit like deer in the headlights. Frank made the comment it reminded him of the Uncertainty Principle - the more precisely the POSITION is determined, the less precisely the MOMENTUM is known... Amen to that.  Looking at the live footage from Punta Gorda - few had prepared for the hurricane and they evacuated possibly hours before the hurricane hit. I realize it is far better to feel sheepish because you prepared and never got hit, than to not prepare and get walloped.  Not that I would ever want for this to happen (I'm not the type to say: bring it on!) but I would love to see, in the midst of such devastation, a lone dome home sitting intact and unharmed. Such evidence would make people realize that alternative types of homes - homes that are more energy efficient, more hurricane/tornado proof, etc. are really the ideal way to go, especially all along coasts in hurricane-risk areas.  And, while I am a little, private practice with few resources to waste, I admit even I FTP'ed my critical files to Globat which hosts my website. We may not have the resources to have an extensive backup and recovery process in place, but even something as silly as creating your own Yahoo group private to yourself, and uploading your files, would be better than doing nothing or using a backup/recovery process that is location-dependent. I have everything on my laptop, currently, but it's nice to know if I lost that laptop, that I could still pick up somewhat where I left off.

      Our area of Tampa Bay has't been hit badly with a hurricane (certainly not in the 7 years I've lived here) and Bonnie's hitting further north but Charley looks like it could hit us. So we're taking the day off to trim some branches and trees to prepare.  I was at a networking luncheon and someone said she was surprised they didn't name the "C" storm Clyde... :P If they'd done that, and the timing/positioning of Bonnie had been a little different, why, we'd have the Perfect Storm. :)  The supermarkets must have anticipated a run; I was surprised to walk into Publix and find there were still canned goods available. I had a hurricane store but it was a bit old, and one can exploded some time ago so I thought now was a good time to replace it. The other thing I've been mulling over was a supplier like Survival Instinct for longer term food storage and water filters.  At a time like this, I wish we'd been able to build our dome home.

      What a way to start networking. Even though my office still isn't ready yet, I figure it will take time for awareness for my new business to percolate through the bay area so I went to a Network of Executive Women luncheon today in downtown Tampa; the speaker was the mayor of Tampa, Pam Iorio. She is dynamic and engaging in person; this was the first time I've ever met her. In the past, through the Oldsmar Chamber of Commerce, I've had the opportunity to meet Oldsmar mayor Jerry Beverland and House representative Gus Bilirakis.  I didn't have a laptop with me so here are some highlights I jotted down from Mayor Iorio's speech. She is a mother of two teenagers, so she began with some amusing stories on that subject.  She then told one story of government letting the people down; they'd helped a mother with government assisted housing, but years later the neighborhood had been taken over by drugs that she no longer felt it was a safe place for her and her children. She seems committed to cracking down on drugs.  Currently, there isn't much connectivity and activity in downtown Tampa past business hours; high on her priority list is building a Riverwalk to attract more residents. She said the advantage of term limits is that it helps create a sense of urgency for projects like this.  She said she's delivered a budget this year with no increases in spending.  One interesting question someone asked concerned qualitative metrics to assess the effectiveness of new programs. The mayor replied no one had ever asked her that question, and said she could see the results. Having worked in IT, I agree with the questioner that without benchmarks, we could never know the  efficacies of those new programs.  Mayor's biography: http://www.tampagov.net/dept_Mayor/biography.asp  The Network of Executive Women meets the second Tuesday of every month at the Centre Club at 123 S. Westshore.  One of the things I would love to see, but haven't yet had the time to research: a non-partisan website where you could do a look up by zip code, and see a list of all candidates from all levels - national to local: every Democrat, Republican, Independent, etc. candidate along with their voting records.
