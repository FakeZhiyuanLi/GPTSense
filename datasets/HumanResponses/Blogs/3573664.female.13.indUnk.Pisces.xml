      jUz came back from band.. Janet said that she coming back today come visit us in e end didn't come... total disgrace man~ oh ya, xiangrong came but after 5 mins then didn't see her liaox.. i think she bored le go home lorx.. (siGHx..) anyways, mr quek was hopping mad today... when we wrong dat time he'll yell..."ITS NOT LIKE THAT.. ITS LIKT THIS!" then he'll sing it all  out.. and if we still get it wrong.. he'll say.."EVEN BENDEMEER IS BETTER THAN YOU! CANOSSA ALSO!~ CAN YOU BUCK UP, MAHABODHi?!?" then eveyrone will be alert cause bendemeer's name was mention.. (our arch enemy..)  anyway, adding a blog for 8th june.. forget to add..  juz went to see harrypotter and de prisoner of azcaban(sp..) MAN IT SUX~ Actually its alrite de.. but they changed SO MANY THINGS! for example, the firebolt was suppose to be a christmas gift from sirius but they squeezed it in juz before the end.. LAME RITE~ and they cut so many things of.. and for another thing, malfoy's hair was suppose to be sleek and shiny but for some unknown reason he went to cut a totally new hairdo (i think its layer) and now he looks like a geek! ANd of course, hermione's hair was suppose to be bushy.. but now's its more of wavy and thin than bushy and thick~ mAn i'm really complaining!
