      i should go to sleep. this seems like a common theme so far, my lack of sleep that is. really the problem is i smoke every night and when i dont..i cant sleep..easily. i  was  supposed to have something to smoke but some of my friends arent really 100% reliable. but its not a big deal. lets pretend im not addicted.  normally this is way early for me to go to bed, i have to get up early tomorrow tho. sunday morning, ugh! i have to go work at the boutique...i belong to an artisans co-op kinda thing. its mostly crafty stuff. basically everyone sells the stuff they make at the boutique and in exchange you have to work at the boutique 7 days during the summer. right now im just selling hemp jewelry and bags i made. so far ive made like 4 times my costs for the materials..so its a nice profit. anyways... tomorrow is my day to work. it wouldnt suck so much if i didnt have to drive 45 minutes to get to the stupid place. i think its better i dont have anything to smoke..i dont think id be able to get up in the morning. i know im going to go to sleep and hes going to call and wake me up, the bastard. im kinda damned if i do damned if i dont.

      im waiting.. justa waiting on you.  so-so productive day. i went and bought some acrylic paints. yay! they were on sale too, which was good because i pretty much spent all my extra money for the next two weeks.. and what i havent spent has already been allocated for other activities. im excited to paint again. i dont really have anything to say right now, im just waiting for my sister to finish work so i can go get her..  im actually in a good mood. might have something to do with the fact i dont have to go to work. i pity those bastards who do. ha. its going to be good to just stay home. im antisocial. i feel bad because people want to do stuff with me but im just like, uh..cant, sorry. but i have to say no sometimes i suppose. im afraid of being a bitch, but sometimes you just dont want to go anywhere....

      i dont title my artwork, why should i title this absurd mess of ramblings?  my favorite time of day. all alone. everyone is in bed but me. i keep weird hours, nocturnal but not quite. usually now id be smoking and watching a movie or something..but im out of weed and i dont have anything to watch. my body is surprisingly enough accepting the lack of smoke. maybe because im keeping myself busy. and i dont have tv. well, i have a tv but no cable so either i have to get a movie (quite easy since my sister works at a video store so i get them free) or watch something ive downloaded. ive gotten ahead of myself. ive watched everything on my computer. im really very proud of myself for going this long without tv. its been almost 3 months! ha! i think 3 months without watching tv would be a long time for anyone. i know most of you dont want to admit it but it is. i had to change cable companies when i moved in june and just never signed up. its like, one less bill to pay. its good tho to be without it. youre not mindlessly wasting your life away in front of a glaring screen. i guess you could kinda say im doing the same thing in front of the computer but this is a tad bit more interactive, i think. thats exactly the point.  i think.   i have this overwhelming need to create lately. i think this is the main problem with my depressive outlook on the world lately. ive been denying myself this need. its just such an effort to drag everything out. oil paint is messy. it doesnt wash out. so i cant really do it here in my tiny apartment. it isnt really that small, but its too small to paint. i want to go buy some acrylic paints when i get my pay this week, financial situation permitting. it probably wont permit. acrylics are less messy, water based. im going to atleast try to get something to work with.. i need a studio! i have an image in my head. i  need  to get it out. sketching doesnt satisfy it. i have a need for a project to fill my walls. i dont care if its crap. i spend way too much time worrying about it. i actually drew with someone staring over my shoulder at work this week..something i would have never done before. i cant stifle myself my entire life because someone might judge me. someone will always be judging me. some people will like what i do and some will hate it. i cant help it. i think if i got through my degree, then there must be some validity to my work. or i hope so.  i feel like im going no where. i should be back at school doing my masters. but im not, im here..wasting away. it really sucks. i cant express how much it does. i took a year off after my ba. now everyone is going back to school but me. i feel left out. i feel old. but theres nothing i can do about it. theres not much i can do about anything.............

      just got home from work. short night..which makes it a good night. not so good for the financial situation tho.. but its okay because the less time i have to spend there is usually the better. so in two weeks from now ill just be bitching about being poor. oh well. i dont usually like to think too far ahead anyways..

      my weekend sucked. i had to spend all day saturday driving my sister around shopping.. which, when you have no money, is especially fun :P and we were both in pissy moods that day so it was really hard not to start a fight. shes kind of annoying... its okay for her to make fun of something i said, or say something i did that was dumb..but as soon as you start picking on her she gets mad. and shes got a little bit of an attitude where she thinks the world revolves around her... you wouldnt really know it unless you know her like i do, because i dont think she acts like that around her friends. but no one really acts the same way around their friends as they do their family... or atleast i dont.. but i think i have a mild case of multiple personality syndrome. everyone one knows a different part of me. i wish i could amalgamate all of my different faces into one but i guess im stuck with my neurotic true self. and they get the (somewhat) normal parts. i dont really think thats fair.  people came over sunday night. it was fun til they started acting like idiots. something happened in the hall way..they were pushing each other around.. and then they spent half an hour in the bathroom. my sister listened at the door and heard someone say "lets just go out and act like were normal." mental cases. this isnt helping my theory that everyone is dumb. maybe i need to stop associating with people who are mentally 6? oh well, they werent my loser friends, they were my sisters.  i dont want to go back to work. but what else is new. they should extend the weekend. they should offer me a job painting murals on the walls.. then maybe id be happy.

      im feeling less cynical today. ha. im really not that bad all the time. one person just set me off and i was just like, what the hell is wrong with people?! it just never ceases to amaze me. but to quote bob,  "dont worry about a thing, every little thing gonna be alright.."  really most of the time i just dont care. no, i do care, i just dont think about it. sometimes its better to live in denial of somethings just to save your sanity. despite what some people might think, there are more important things.

      the eternal struggle. i dont want to go to work but i need money. damn capitalism, damn it all to hell. i like shiny things too much. its a curse that shall plague me for the rest of my being, im sure. again, part of the reason is the people. omg..its a job, not a high school! i dont know why i cant be whiney and bitch when i dont get my way.. hmm..maybe its because im a grown up (or i try to be).. or maybe its because i didnt have everything handed to me my whole life... novel concept. thank you mommy and daddy.

      i dont know why im doing this. i dont write things down.. but its late and im bored. i think the whole motivation might be somewhere to say something where no one i really know is listening. because i dont really like most people i know..because mostly theyre dumb. i find myself disppointed over and over again everytime i meet someone new. everyone is retarded except for me, i swear. but, yeah, thats besides the point. maybe i just need somewhere to bitch. i bitch to the few people i know that arent dumb but they seem sometimes not to get it..because, in the end, they are concerned mostly with themselves, like everyone else. so i guess its useless to try. wow. such happiness beams from me. ha. but theres only so much bullshit you can take before you start acting all cynical and shit. and its just been a real bullshit week. and this does tend to be the general consensus lately. "ah, sorry im bitchy, its been a real shitty week." so what does this say about me? i hate everyone pretty much and everything sucks. im a great example of a human being myself! at least i can recognize it, i guess.
