       It was really great... yesterday. oh yeah... almost what you would call perfect.     &nbsp;   yesterday me and cory went to the movies. it was me, him, Ricky, Sammie, and Ben. and it was kewlish. lol we we're sitting there kissing and like well... lets just say it was my actual first kiss. and appearentally im not that bad. which is a relief cuz the whole time i was thinking that i would suck.     &nbsp;   no, we didnt make out the whole movie. but we kissed during most of it... then i feel asleep on him for like 20 minutes. well, i didnt mean to, i actually seriously believe it or not wanted to see that movie. the movie was King Arthur. if it was good... just tell me. lol. but okay when the movie ended we we're the only 2 ppl left n the theater place thingy and like we started kissing and Ricky yells "CORY!" and so we stop and look behind us to find the person who cleans after ever movie thingy standing there waiting for us to finish our lil monment lol. Cory turns to the guy while im running out embarrassed and just starts being like "hey! whats up?" lol it was interesting...     &nbsp;   then like towards the beginning he goes up to this dude who was there from this radio station and like pulls me over to him and says to the dude "don't you think we look so cute together?" lol the guy goes "yeah you 2 look great... hey just for that..." and he gives us a lil keychain thingy. lol it was kewlish!     &nbsp;   oh and yesterday was a really special day bc guess what?! it was OUR day! yes, not only was it&nbsp;a tuesday, but it was the 27th and thats our # cuz 2 is my fave # and 7 is his. hehe so its special! lol

       Ok, yesterday was interesting. Pretty much ok for most of the day. Went to church... got back and talked on the phone trying to figure out who all was going to be going to the spoken concert at my church that night. it turned out to where Cory got to go. YAY!     &nbsp;  we got there and everything was fine. i was with Logan, Leah, and Ben and we we're waiting for Cory to come and Jeff but we didn't expect him till later. I was wearing all black and well, looked really goth. That's not normal for me btw... i mean i normally gots the preppy look goin on and well ok so anyways Cory's dad and step-mom come and drop him off... well... gives me this huge evil look. cuz of what im wearing. and his step-mom had seen me before... and i was dressed nicely i guess then.    &nbsp;  so now, to them (this really isn't me), i am a stupid- depressed- teenager- on drugs. wow...    &nbsp;  kinda pissed me off that cory's dad got all mad at him for what i looked like, bc well he liked me and shit. but yeah. its stupid! i just wanna like hurt him. it makes me feel so bad...    &nbsp;  then well, that was the least of my problems. i see Chris (old uth minister) and Cory had got me to call him up thinking that it would help me earlier. and so i did and we talked a lil and well, we planned on talking more about it later. well okay, the 1st time i saw him it was fine... i went over to his car with him and we just talked for a sec and then well he was out for the 2nd time (he was helping with the tech stuff last night 4 the concert) and like he was hanging out with some of the kids and i just about broke.     &nbsp;  i stood there probably for like 30 minutes with Cory next to me just gently touching my hand just to tell me its okay and that hes here for me while i sat there starring into nothing. i got up and walked away and he kept following me. finally giving up from turning away from him, i just hugged him tightly for a second basically telling him to hold me and like, thats what he did.&nbsp;he just held me.&nbsp; he pulled my face up to try to get me to look up at him but i didnt. i couldnt. and i did once and i just started crying and i couldnt stop. he just held me.     &nbsp;  then he pulled my face up and i opened my eyes a little bit, i could barely keep my head up, and like he kissed me. it&nbsp;almost like hurt at first... but well it didn't in the end.    &nbsp;  but then Cindy (old sunday school teacher before i starting helping out with teaching the 2 and&nbsp; 3 yr olds at my church) came up to us and was like "10 ft away!" lol it was kinda funny but i was to numb to laugh. then she asked me if i was okay and looked at cory odd and well just walked away.     &nbsp;  he whispered "i love you" and "are you sure your okay...?" to me a few times and just held me tightly. honestly, i was so thankful he was there even though it was embarrassing for him to see me like that. but it felt so right. when he stood there holding me... it really did. it felt like that was how things we're suppost to me. so it was like... great though not, ya no?    &nbsp;  we talked about it later and he basically told me that he would rather me cry on him then cry alone... and that he was happy that it happened even though he didn't like seeing me like that. because like, in the end it really did bring us closer. ALOT closer really...    &nbsp;  where would i be without him?    lets not go there...

        i have so many thoughts in my head right now... i'd go to write them down and well nothing would come out.&nbsp; and i hate it. im so tired of hateing life. last night i was talking to Cory at about midnight and he says to me after i tell him whats going on and after i vent to him::     &nbsp;   "You really don't know how beautiful you are, do you?"     &nbsp;   that almost made me cry...&nbsp;i asked him how much he really worried about me and like... "more then you know..." he knows that just the night before if i hadnt like passed out and fell asleep that well... i may not be here right now. so ever since then especually hes been looking out for me.     &nbsp;   i love him sooooooooooo much...

       Well I know what I have to do now... I just don't want to do it. Actually, I'm so afraid of doing it. But I have to do it, and not look past. Even if it means hurting someone else, I have to do it, cause in the long run they'll be okay. And if I don't do this, in the long run...&nbsp; I won't be.     &nbsp;  Actually went out with my dad today... it was kinda kewlish. I mean, I seriously can't remember the last time we went out and did something just me and him. And I hate that. But I feel closer to him now and I think... no, I know it did us both a lot of good.    &nbsp;  I didn't post this yesterday lol so I figured I should/ could now. I have to tell someone... or something since probably no one else reads this... what's been going on. lol   I went and stayed the night at Peak's house and well we snuck out. It was awesome! We went through the graveyard and around town some. Her boyfriend (kinda her bf... not totally... its very complacating) didn't believe that we would actually do it though we said we would. So we went out and knocked on his door even with the possibility of getting him in trouble. (His dad would have killed him if he knew about it... that's also one of the reasons we did it though. LOL) It was great!     &nbsp;  In the process of all that we almost got caught like 5xs. lol, my the police, by someone who walked out his house and saw us, dogs barking, her and this sinario that was quite interesting, and well me once. lol but we made it home without getting caught and yeah... it was great!    &nbsp;  I got the Hoobastank CD, actually the 1st one. I'm not much for those 2 songs they play on the radio (The Reason and some other song&nbsp;I can't think of the name of right now.)&nbsp; But yeah, I mainly got it for that song "Running Away" and "Crawling in the Dark" so yeah... lol kinda pathedic. But the rest of the CD really isn't that bad. I just have to get used to it.

         How do you get over something without burying it?        &nbsp;   I swear its a question that continuously ask myself... especually recently. And the more I do... the more it hurts to think about. I just don't want to say anymore "Oh well..." Becuase its NOT "oh well" its something I need to start dealing with. I need to start doing this because I can't keep comparing Willis to Chris and I can't keep looking for Chris every Sunday morning praying he's there. And I have to trust that God knows what He's doing.     &nbsp;    Easier said then done...        &nbsp;   Sadly... I mean I'm not even really talking to God right now and here I am saying "Trust in God... He knows what He's doing." Uh huh, yeah, I feel like I'm lying to myself when I say that.     &nbsp;   Everything will get better though, just keep telling myself this and hopefully I'll begin to believe it. I have to... I want to... I can... eventually...
