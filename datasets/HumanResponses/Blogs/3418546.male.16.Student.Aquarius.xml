      So it's the week before finals of second semester for my Sophomore year in Highschool... I'm half way there!  My teachers have been POURING on the homework which I have done almost NONE of... =X  I think, traditionally... School would always _slow down_ in the last few weeks.. and since the teachers know that, that give us homework to compensate for the slowing-downage...when in fact, EVERY teacher is giving loads of work so it's hecktic! Oh well... When all is said and done, two weeks from now--I won't be in school!  I can't let my summer go to shammbles like last, and before that. Sitting on my ass from 5 to 5.. and other _unmentionable_ things. I need to be productive. Next year I signed up for as many possibly honors classes available...and I have never been in an honors class in my LYFE!  This means I need to BUST MY ASS! And not the kind of "Okay Pol, it's sophomore year already i really need to bust my ass"... kind of BUST MY ASS... I'm talking-- REAL kind of bust my ass! YEAH!  Lots of physical activities. Staying focused on work. Lots of rest. haha..yeah..I can do it!  But I always have the option of dropping classes in that first month... Which I hopefully will not have to resort to!

      So, the reason I chose to sign up for a Blogger account is because I found out that it's "maintained" by Google! and Google is such a great site/company/people.  I already have a "diary" account (if that's what this is)... on  urlLink LiveJournal   But I haven't been keeping up to date with it and since I created this I will most likely not post there every...again.   I _hope_ that this doesn't turn into my LiveJournal, and slowly crawl into oblivion... but i'm just a person with nothing to write about!  But I have to be optimistic! I'm WRONG! I have _everything_ to write about! And I will not cease to dazzle and amaze you all with my extremely-wonderful-writings! (a.k.a exworits) ...that is, for a week at least. :)  Well as my keychain says... "I

      Ahhh Yes so today is the first Wednesday of my summer...  It's started out really good this year and I can only hope it stays that way!  I've been hanging out with some cool people (lauren, tim, sammy, kelly, rich, dan)... I've never really been around them a lot before so I have yet to see if they really like me.  Yesterday I was at Garrett's house cause his girlfriend got in a car crash :O! and we picked him up.  I played Halo on his x-box..it was fun.  I think I have Rich to thank for most of this cause he's a cool guy and lets me tag along at shows with him and stuff.... I just hope he doesn't get too sick of me.  I've been trying to keep myself busy and it's been working for the most part.  I still need to sort out all my schoolwork so I can stash my bookbag somewhere and be RID of it til next year..  I broke my new birthday-gift computer [twice] and I have the new parts sitting in my room ready to be installed.... I hope I don't break it again!  I really want to be able to play quake3 again and listen to some nice music... I've also been working on a  urlLink website for my mom   Anyway thanks for reading, keep me busy, call me up 9221752! PEACE

      Why must there always be talking?  Whenever I'm with my friends and the chatter stops for just a second, someone comments "awkward silence", or... "Yeahhhhh soooooo....what do you guys want to do now?"  They act like the silence offends them, they can't stand for it and it's just so 'NOT COOL'.  There always needs to be Action, FUN, drama, excitement. Sitting and contemplating is just so "boring" and "dull". You know what, I agree with you.  But words spoken that aren't "forced" are so much more honest, and honorable.  Have you ever had a nice conversation with an adult and hit some silence? Did either of you comment on how "bored" you are now?.....I don't think that happens so often. But why?  I don't talk a lot. Anyone who hangs around with me can easily understand this. It might change one day, but if so--it probably won't be for a while...  I've been called "boring", referred to as "the guy just sitting there in the corner", or "seeming like i'm just not there"...but I have also been called "interesting", "fun", and.. "the kid with the hair". So who am i supposed to believe?

      I've begun a running routine... For the past 6 days I've run 3 laps at Millennium Park [1.2 miles]. I've tried to begin and maintain a routine like this before but quit after several days, but I feel like I can push myself to continue doing and enjoying this.  It helps me stay fit, and it feels good to be active too--instead of sitting at home all day everyday [which is what I do anyway]  I've kept a log of my running...Something like this:  DATE			DISTANCE		TIME		DESCRIPTION  TU 2004-07-06		3 laps (1.2 miles)	N/A		N/A  WE 2004-07-07		3 laps (1.2 miles)	N/A		N/A  TH 2004-07-08		3 laps (1.2 miles)	N/A		The first time I've run a whole lap without stopping.  FR 2004-07-09		3 laps (1.2 miles)	15:00		Unfortunately, I didn't run a lap without stopping.  SA 2004-07-10		3 laps (1.2 miles)	13:23		Ran first lap without stopping; saw Sammy & Lauren!  SU 2004-07-11		3 laps (1.2 miles)	13:34		Ran both first & second lap without stopping.  So good luck to me! :) And good day to you.. !

      I think I might have been wrong about my friends.. I just got home from Tim's house and I had a real great time.  We played some pool basketball, ate some hotdogs [although I didn't have one], and made a fun little dance in the pool. :)  I asked Tim&Sam about the other night--and how it seemed like they were blowing me off.. But it turns out I got the whole thing wrong. It was all in my head.  I always make my best attempt at looking at the bright side of things, but it's like my brain naturally tries to conceive the worst conspiracies....Damn you brain. Heh. Heh.  All I can say is I hope things stay good cause I'm still new to them....But they make me feel good.   Moral of the blog- Look on the bright side of things & THERE ISN'T ALWAYS A CONSPIRACY

      Greetings. ....Sent.  Here goes Google-rave post #2:  I've finally received my [FREE] Google T-Shirt in the mail!  After a nice back-forth email question I had with a Google staff member, the nice guy/girl decided to send off a nifty shirt! ... It's really hot, I love sporting it. :)  And the greatest accessory to go with it? An  urlLink invitation  to a  urlLink Gmail  account.. that's right-- 1 GB of quality email service.. Whoo!  On another note... It's starting to seem like my new freinds lately have been drifting away- sad. :(  Since it's summer, I feel more lonely than usual cause I don't have 2600 faces to see every day.. But- days get better... I know this holds true.  At least i got outside today...I went for a walk by myself for about an hour. But it was well worth it.  It made me feel a lot better than sitting at home on my computer...  A tip to the alienated youth: get outside. just go walk. :)  .........Nice day to you,
