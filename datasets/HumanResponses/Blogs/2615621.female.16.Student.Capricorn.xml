      yay!! we were outta school all week and it's suppose to snow this sunday nite!! WOOOO WHOOO!! haha ok. Last night john came over to eat dinner with just my mom, yea my mom managed to send my brothers away and i went to his house to babysit while roberta worked. I made $40 in 3 hrs. YAY!! good money there. What i NEED to do is put that whole $40 in the bank, but i hate putting money in the bank. If i would just hand it to my grandfather and tell him bank please it would go to the bank and i wouldnt have to deal with it and wondering what to spend it on and then i'll have $40 when i get money outta the bank. And if i give it to my grandfather he usually doubles the amount and puts it in. So maybe he'll put $80 in there and then i'll have $80 instead of $40 just for putting money in the bank!! yay...but wait...i wanted to go shopping-who doesnt though? I wanted to go buy something. im addictied to just buying "things". My dad is coming to visit in exactly a week and he takes me shopping and get to buy all the clothes i want. So why should i waste my money on clothes this week?? hmm..i dont know. If i say to my mom "hey im gonna put $20 in the bank, so will u please buy this shirt for me?" i bet she'll buy it or whatever it is, just because im putting money in the bank. Now, the next $20 of that 40 i wanted to go tanning. I know i know...tanning...maybe a waste to some. But i've always wanted to tan and until recently my mom wouldn't let me. But, i want to tan and it takes $20 for 10 sessions. So, thats like $2 a session which is all good i guess. The first time i prob wont stay in there put 3-5 minutes, so for $2 i guess thats a lil less than an dollar a minute. Then again, i still havnt planned out mine and kaelas girl day. For christmas i was going to take her to get a french manicure (her fave) which is gonna cost me $15 and i was going to just get a regular manicure or my acrilylic nails done again (even though they hurt when u take them off and make ur real nails look and feel like shit, i think they're pretty), so for me im looking at anywhere from $10-30. I was then going to take her to a movie or something, which by the way i had passes for, but i used one of them. So now i'm looking at like $5 (we'd go in the afternoon). I'm sure my mom would supply the difference in all of that with my $40...and since im not babysitting as much these days i don't know when my next $$ will come in..haha sounds like a drug dealer. Oh well, i know what i'm going to do, take mom to the mall, have her buy me what i was going to buy with my money, put at least $10 in the bank and go tanning...more than likely. YUP. thats what im going to do.   Last nite i watched the movie Cabin Fever all by myself starting at about 12am. It's a movie about these teenagers who go up to this cabin after college finals to spend a week. And well..it's full of bloody nasty ass murders and crazy people. I figured it would be really scary like the man in the woods always jumping out with a knife. Naw, it's scary but not in that sense. You're on your toes about what you're going to see next. It didnt give me nightmares. :D lol BUT while i was watching it i did miss lorne. Here's why- he always like put his arms around me and held me ..and well, i like to be held. haha i like to cuddle. And in the movie theres always that couple and then another "should be" couple. I saw them and wanted that too. Buy hey, maybe it just wasnt lorne i wanted, maybe it was just a dude. That's prob it. Oh well.   Lately jordan has been talking nonstop about this amber chick from central. Shes a freshman and i've seen 2 pics of her and i've supposedly met her because she knows me. This is the 4rd girl he's liked since i've liked him. And the thing is, all 4 girls have liked him back, but things just didnt work out between them. In the time ive known jordan and even last year when i just knew of him, i've never seen a girl have a crush on him or him have a gf. But there i went, liking him. And as soon as i dont like him all these girls come after him!! haha well GO JORDAN! Naw, i'm happy for him and prob wouldnt date him if given the chance right now, but i miss that feeling. I want to have a crush on someone, i want to feel like jordan made me feel and i want to be all nervous like the first time lorne called me. UGH. lol I dont know what i want.

J-SnizzleFizzle: lmao uh no JosiahBaker: lol JosiahBaker: uh yeah  awww lol and i know on laurens blog she has something he has said to her too..lol but yeah, if he was right then i wouldnt be without a guy lol At least he's seen me, twice to be exact, and thought the same thing both times...lol yay. anyways i just got back from the mall and bought this cute pair of lite blue cords from Belks..im thinkin black shirt and black boots until spring. I actually bought a size below what i usually wear and they were comfy so i was happy about that..haha it made up for what Goodys did to me the other day. lol oh well, i gotta go eat im STARVIN

      YAY! no school..snow! i think lorne freakin made me sick...all the sudden (a week later) i have this cold type thing. it's really gross..ugh just the taste of a cold is gross. Lorne went for the weekend to Charoltte for a West Coast/Orange County chopper bike show..i bet he was really excited, he loves those things. He didnt tell me he was going, his friend did. I missed him all weekend, just not talking to him. I haven't talked to him since like Thursday. I thought about calling him yesterday but decided not to, i just honestly wanted to hear his voice. Well, comes to find out, it wouldnt have done any good, he went to California. And again, he didnt tell me. I have all these thoughts in my head i want to tell him, i  NEED  to tell him just so i can get it all straight in my lil head. I want to tell him that i still have feelings for him, and no matter how hard i try to push him away i just end up chasing back after him. It's like kicking a ball around. You kick the ball as hard as you can, and if it had feelings i'm sure it would hurt (lol) and then you want it back so you run as fast as you can to go get it..but only to kick it again. I want to stop playing ball...i don't want to chase it anymore. I decided that if i really was over lorne then i would have stopped caring so damn much and he would be outta my head. But there is that little angel on my left side that tells me "if you get him back you'll turn around and do the same thing all over again, and hurt him more" and then the lil devil on my right side says "get him back, you want him for the MOMENT". this may sound against all i have ever said or thought about him, but the best thing that could happen would for him to say "julia, i gave it a chance, but i just dont want to try it again with you" Him saying that would settle everything, i would get it through my head that he doesnt like me anymore, that he doesnt care, and knowing that would FORCE me to stop caring and to stop liking him. I wouldn't have a choice. I want him to say that...but then again, i like him. I want him to make the decision, do we try it again or do we stop and go on by ourselves. Wow..i was just honest with myself.

      Sleeping To Dream by Jason Mraz  I’m dreaming of sleeping next to you I’m feeling like a lost little boy in a brand new town I’m counting my sheep and  each one that passes is anotherdream to ashes and they all fall down.  As I lay me down tonight,  I close my eyes and what a beautiful sight  I’m sleeping to dream about you  I’m so tired of having to live without you  But I don't mind I’m sleeping to dream about you and I’m so tired  I found myself in the riches your eyes, your lips, your hair Well you were everywhere But I woke up in the ditches. I hit the light and I thought you might be here but you were nowhere. You were nowhere at home.  As I lay me back to sleep  Lord I pray that I can keep  Sleeping to dream about you  I’m so tired of having to live without you  But I don't mind I’m sleeping to dream about you and I’m so tired  It’s just a little a lullaby to keep myself from crying myself to sleep at night  Sleeping to dream about you  I’m so tired of having to live without you  But I don't mind Sleeping to dream about you and I’m so tired

      whoa i had one crazy ass nite last nite!! i ( me..julia..the one who doesnt really go all out and do these things) but yeah...i got drunk. haha Actually, it's not what i thought it would be. I went next door to my neighbors, she's soooo crazy and we hang out a lot now, but anyways, she's 28 and lives with her dad (who has been takin my mom out on dates) and i babysit her 3 year old son. haha yeah, crazy story. Well, anyways, i go over there and she's always drinking or on something (shes also on probation so she cant leave her house after 6pm for another 8 weeks) and when i'm over there she always offers me a sip or something of her drinks, but this time..she had like 3 6 packs of this orange beer called Hootch Hard..lmao and well, i drank my own 6 pack..yeah...hey it was good stuff!! I didnt plan on it, but yeah i got a buzz. I then had 4 shots of something, i dont remember what it was, and 2 puckers, which is this really sour stuff wtih a ZAP POW to it. By 1am my mom and her dad had gotten home and i got my ass outta there after eating toothpaste (so my mom wouldnt smell it) and before she caught on. I went home and then to bed...after peeing WAY 2 MUCH i swear, i've never peed so much. Anyways, this morning i woke up and my eyes were still dialiated to like the max and my throat stung soo bad. I get on and i tell jordan all about my nite and he's so proud of me cuz this is what he does like every weekend, but anyways, he tells me that im way too dehydrated and need to drink a glass of water slowly every 15mins. So i drink one glass of water...and still my throat stings. As of right this second, my throat still doesnt feel the same, but oh well. I remember looking through those drunk goggles at school, but nothing seemed the way they do in those stupid goggles..haha I did throw up, twice actually. I drank 2 bottles in 30seconds going against Roberta in our own little contest and i won..and had to pee like amost instantly. We then talked about doing Whipetts (the whip cream can thing) next time we hang out. haha fun stuff, she knew exactly what to do and i thought it was funny people actually do that kinda stuff. I usually dont run around and drink and do things seriously to "get a buzz" but i gotta admitt, i can see why people do it, it's fun. Ok, so maybe my 28 yr old friend is a bad influence, but oh well! haha I dont think i'll ever drink that much again, until this summer when i go to Hondoras!! haha

      i havent written a blog in like a few days...maybe cuz my mom was being a bitch and took the computer away...lol but im baaaackkkkk!!! haha I went to the movies last nite with liz, ashley, and josiah (lornes best friend). Liz was my "date" so dont even begin to think i had something going on with lornes bud, that's too mean haha. Well, ashley got pissed off at me cuz i didnt tell her how ugly joe was...so what...deal u shallow bitch. Yeah, he's not the hottest, and yeah..he looks like a freakin weird monster some little kid would be scared of, but hey, i wanted you to find out yourself. There has been too many times where i've called someone ulgy to only find out the person i was telling that to thought differently. I wasn't going to ruin anything for ashley. (muhahaha i knew he was butt ass ulgy and i knew she'd think the way she did). but who cares. I would only do that to ashley. lol Thats why i told joe to stay away from liz and lauren!! haha as in realtionship wise. He thinks lauren is taken my Willbo ne ways. :D   Mikel went all out asking about Lauren and i went off on him when he said he heard lauren was a flirt. UGH i'd give anything to bet katie mckee started it. she cant stand for lauren to have any attention, when lauren gets attention over anyone, doesnt matter who it is, i'm sittin there going YAY!! THATS MY GIRL!! not "omg how to steal it away from her" fuck anyone who does that to my bitch lauren. hahaha ( i got ur back girl). Lauren deserves a lot more credit for everything than people give her. They listen to katie mckee too much, they stare at katies stupid ass boobs way too much to actually listen to what she says and think "omg is this girl crazy?!" and make their own minds up about the people katie talks about. pisses me off more than anything. Mikel did call Lauren hot, and i corrected him MAJORLY on his "i hear shes a big flirt" statement. fuck whoever started that shit.   The last few days i've been thinkin about lorne on and off more and more. And i thought i liked him again and i would try to patch all the cuts i've already made, but then, and maybe it just hit me..i'm not going to try. I dont want to be single anymore...but i dont want someone who lives 30mins away from me and can't drive yet....  My mom has been dating my neighbor lately, they are going on their 2nd date tonite, well 2nd offical date, i dont think them hanging out at each other houses really count. She hasnt really told anyone about these hot dates though..lol i think its funny. I'm so glad shes going out and having fun with him. He's a really nice guy and loves to do things. My ex-step-dad never did anything like that. He always sat around the basement being a stupid pain in the ass grumpy fuck off. He never took mom anywhere and was a 24/7 bitch making her a 24/7 bitch at times. Well...he's gone thank god, and i'm glad mom is finally have fun. Shes going to the movies tonite with john and out to dinner. Her and mike were married for like 7 years and he never took her to the movies. fuck him. She's really happy and tomorrow shes taking me shopping!! yay!! haha i like it when shes happy..hehehe that means im happy too. She's already told me she's not going to remarry...i hope shes right. It's only the 2nd date, and she's not legally divorced, only seperated, but the thought of another man in my mom's life like that scares the shit outta me. I know...i know...i've just been through too much. I was such a daddy's girl and i did everything with my dad and mike wasnt a "dad" to me, it was like he tried to take my dad's place but he never could..he only told me he loved me 1 time and i didnt say anything back, and it was when he first married my mom...I can't deal with that shit. Ok...before i get on a kick about my shitty childhood like ally hilfigure i'm gonna stop...lol But just for the record, my childhood was great until my parents divorced.   MY DAD IS COMING TO VISIT FEB 6-7th!! yay!!! i cant wait..means i get to see him and go shopping yay! :D

      DAMN MOTHER FUCKER. ok..lorne took it soo hard that i was breaking things off or breaking things off before they could turn into things. ok..he told me he was sorry i felt that way and that i was really missing out ...( no im not...) and how well...idk..lets just say LORNE HATES ME NOW. oh well...i could really care less. You cant know someone for like a week and like them sooo much it actually "hurts" when they dont like you back. well he "hurts" dammit. i dont care anymore. if i get desprate i'll just run back and say i made a big misktake and i miss him..lmao yeah...i just dont like lorne anymore. dammit. its that simple. UGH ok..i'm just really tense all the sudden...fuck everything.

      lol i cant keep it to myself ne more and i dont want EVERYONE to know...just strangers (if they even read this shit) and Lauren, but i gotta laugh about it. OK. Lorne..lmao omg when he was at my house we were sittin on the couch and we start making out, well it wasnt good, but ne ways, we were making about and through the whole time his legs were shakin like he was nervous and well then they stopped...and when we were done i looked down and he has fuckin jizzed his pants. LMAO OK..gross...i think that turned me off a whole lotta. Ok..now that its out in the open with lauren, we can laugh about it now..haha just dont tell anyone. But trust me..it was gross. i made a dude bust a nut without touchin him..ooo im good!! haha naw, hes just not normal.

      yay..lorne came over..and i bet you're wondering why there isnt a bunch of !!!!! at the end of that. I was so excited for him to come over and all and he did and so did liz and lauren and we had a great time and did your normal boy with girl hang out stuff..yeah we made out. was it good?? not at the beginging but he did improve once he let off on the tounge haha. He went off and told his friend josiah that he liked me A LOT and i was exactly what he was looking for in a girl and all that good stuff...but at the same time im thinking "do i really wanna be with lorne??". I decided..uh...maybe not as much as i thought. IDK. IM FUCKING CONFUSED of exactly how i feel. I dont want anything too serious, yet, i've been wishing and hoping to find a serious bf. So, theres lorne...yeah...mr. what i thought was gonna be all perfect and wonderful..and then theres me..not knowing what i want to do. Then, i start talking to one of my good guy friends Todd and we've always kept in touch since he moved schools and stuff and i think i like him. Ive known him since the 7th grade and lorne for only a little over a week...idk it could just be something im going through. I want to have that so called "freedom" to date around, but then again...i've ALWAYS had that "freedom" and have never been too tied down recently. So, i tell josiah all this stuff on my mind and im flat out honest cuz i know it will get back to lorne..and it did..and joe didnt tell me he told lorne so lorne calls me and we hardly talk..i didnt know what to say. the call was 5mins, most are at least an hour. I feel like the biggest bitch. He was so excited about there being an "us" and i went and ruined it at the last minute, its not totally over and its not ruined..just slowed down and put on hold. I dont know what to say or do next around him. We had plans to go somewhere tomorrow...we'll prob go, since i have to give him his dvd back..damn why did he forget it? I dont know what i want..everything seemed to come so natural with him and all..i have no fucking clue. i say fuck it all. i want a bf sooo bad one minute and cry about being single, then i ruin it for myself. my nickname might as well be Chickenshit jr.

Lorne and i can just hang out and it's all good. HOPEFULLY Lauren and Will can come over also..god i hope so. I mean...i know lorne and i arent just gonna sit there through a movie...haha but if we do something then will and lauren just might!! Oh boy..i hope liz doesnt come over and they do that...eeek! haha Its like after 2am and i still have to clean my room...hahaha omg and it's such a mess if u know me u know how scary it can get. Well...im sooo happy about lorne but then at the same time im wondering if its gonna be the slightest bit weird. I dont think it will be..who knows...i think everything will go ok and if it doesnt..then it wasnt meant to be. haha Ok, its like now 2:20 and i gotta clean my room and im about to pass out. Nite

      just felt like gettin on my blog and talking to it..haha I'm doing Honors World History, yay, all of it..usually we get 2 days to do a bunch of shit but i sit there and do nothing, well actually i've been doing makeup work from when i missed ONE day. And i'm still not caught up. I have to finish my world map test. I was talkin to lornes friend tommy a few mins ago and he said lorne was talkin about me while they were working on his car. I wish i could just be a fly on the wall and hear everything he says. I still cant wait until saturday nite. I hope he can come over. Kristen doesnt like joe, but i invited joe over to be with kristen...i really wish that lorne could just come over and be with me, but it might feel a lil weird, we've never been alone. It doesnt make any sense. He's planning on asking me out saturday and we've known each other for not too long, what a huge leap..going from hanging out 2 times to being a couple...hmm..oh well, i'm not gonna stop it. I talked to ashley g. tonite and she told me she liked this guy named jordan and how he was in her art class..it was jordan childress, as in my old jordan. lol I was like yay!! cuz jordan needs a good catholic girl in his life (rolling of the eyes but only for his betterment - is that even a word??) Comes to find out jordan had his eyes on ashley too. They both know the other likes the other and yea..lol YAY me. More hookups..but of all the people in the world, the one person i want to see find someone she truly likes and gets along with is Lauren (yeah u). I mean, honestly, there's nothing wrong with her. Shes beautiful and is a great all around person. It almost makes me want to wish i could have met lorne after she met someone. idk why really... but things happen in their own time. Blind dates do wonders!! I'll have to take her with me and lorne and a friend of his sometime!! haha yeah, but only after i see his friend and he passes my approvement, i just really wish will would get his stupid ass act together, cuz i know he likes lauren- hes told me. maybe he feels nothing is really happening..who knows. but oh well, lauren- step out there and get him--i believe in ya.

      OKAY IM OFFICALLY PISSED OFF. why?! lol well..im pissed off with a smile on my face cuz..one- i got lorne on my mind..and 2- cuz its about lorne..and anything about lorne is smilie. haha WELL. Kristen. KRISTEN KRISTEN. She likes lorne..she calls lorne...she makes lorne take up for her when people say things...she complains and whines to lorne...she makes him stay on the phone with her when he tries to tell her he wants to go and call me before it gets too late...i dont like it. Lorne is sooo totally mine it's not even funny. The one guy that seems like mr perfect the one dude that seems like he could mean the world to me one of these days comes along and kristen has to like him.  Yeah, i've had my crush on andrew when katie was dating him, but god, i didnt step in the way of anything at all. She calls me a whore and a bitch and all these uncalled for things in front of lorne and it makes her look really stupid, but still, the point is she tries to take his attention off of me thinkin it will make him like her. NOPE sorry kristen. UGH i dont like it AT ALL. Kristen needs to let things go and leave lorne alone...lol Cuz by Saturday i'll be lornes GIRLFRIEND. yay lol I can see where kristen is coming from, and yeah shes my friend..but i guess things like this will bring out her true colors. She'll find someone, and it wont be lorne.

      Lauren this one is for u...  You're one of the best people i know and one of the best friends i have. You're beautiful, talented, and a lil quirky which is great!! I just read ur blog and u know i can totally connect to you and now i see why im your friend. Not like i havent seen before, but just that i realized another reason why. I know what you mean about katie and mikel..its stupid...it sucks for andrew...and i have a feeling the "drama" will have a re-run marathon on tv sometime soon...but u know what, i'll be too busy with my own damn life to tune in. Katie needs to stop before she ruins another friendship..takes away another friend...makes another person hate her...or hurts another person. UGH pisses me off too.   You wont only have Blood hun...who knows...i met lorne in a weird situation and hey, i hear that guy has some friends...lol u know what im talkin about.   Just remember that i'm always here...and i've been through most of it too...hey corey did say u were fucking hot. lol whatever happened to him? and i promise chicken shit, i'll never ever ever tell you about a dude and his plans..cuz i found out how it feels..now im sooo nervous about when lorne asks me out..haha   Love ya girl  OH AND U CAN REALLY WRITE A BLOG TOO!!!

      today went alright. There was a wrestling match and it went well even though we lost. The wrestlers are sooo freakin awesome!! lol its fun ridding that stinky bus with those guys. Theres this girl, Laura Greene who used to be a matmaid and comes along to help every now and then, no one likes her. I get on the bus and i hear..oh yeah, laura is coming too. I tell Leslie to sit with me so laura doesnt. They all laugh, yeah..i made a funny..but i kinda felt bad, well maybe not bad, just i didnt want her to hear what i had said. She ends up driving herself there and back all by herself and on the way home a wrestler was like "so which one of u matmaids wants my beef in ur taco?" There is only me and Leslie so we both laugh. Someone then starts talkin about Laura and how they all want her number and they bet she'll put out for all of them. It was soooo mean but harlious. Even the coaches were laughing, even meanier. I then got home about 9:30ish and talk to Lorne.Kristen calls me and tells me she has some news. She tells me that her, joe, and lorne were all talkin and decided that joe liked me and lorne liked kristen so we were gonna swtich. WHAT THE FUCK?! i about had a fuckin cow. Then i hear kristen laughing saying GOT YA!!! omg she scared the shit outta me!!! lol She then laughed and made me promise not to tell anyone, but that Lorne is gonna ask me out this weekend when he comes over. YAY!! He told joe and joe told kristen but lorne made joe promise not to tell ne one..and then joe made kristen promise not to tell anyone..but hell i know now and trust me, i'll tell my friends HAHA. It would be kinda fun to go back to school and be like..yeah lorne and i are dating now..i wish kristen hadnt had told me, but then again...i knew it was coming. Lorne and i are like the perfect couple. Tonite we were on the phone and i was fighting with a diet coke box to get a soda outta it and i couldnt get it open so i grabbed a knife. Lorne was like, why dont u just get a kinfe? like the second i grabbed it. We laughed about it as i stuck the kinfe in the box..not thinkin about the sodas inside..well the knife goes through a soda and it starts spraying EVERYWHERE and im like OMG lol and we're both laughing our heads off over my stupid diet coke mess. We talked on the phone for a pretty good while, for about an hour and a half. Our shortest phone call ever. haha I really like Lorne and i cant wait until saturday nite when he comes over!! yay!!! I tell him around 11:30 that i gotta go do hw..lol he doesnt want me to go but i dont want to go either..but i gotta do what i gotta do. Lorne and i arent even offically dating yet and im already starting to think about how stuff will go and how long we'll last. I dont want to get hurt, but i think he knows that. Ive always been so jealous over people who have a bf or gf, used to piss me off, but now that im sooo close to having that i dont feel the same like i used to. Thats all i used to want, but then..i guess now that i'll have it im worried of what we'll do and what will happen to us since he doesnt go to MA and we wont get to see each other everyday. Another thing, girls like lorne..all i hear about from his friend is how like 5 girls are jealous cuz lorne and i are talking and they dont have a chance with him...damn..what am i gonna do with a wanted man?! haha Trust him i guess. I hope i can..i dont want to turn into ex who is labled "pyscho bitch" LMAO Naw, i do worry about how well i know lorne. Ive only known him like exactly a week i think. DAMN thats not long. But we talk so much its like ive known him longer..he told me he feels like hes known me his whole life..wow idk if i feel that same way, but ok. I'm going out on a limb here to do something and get something ive lately been dieing for. Here he is..what i think is Mr. Perfect and he came around at the right time in my life. I'm truly happy..but nervous about what im gonna say when he asks me out HAHA besides yes that is.

      YAY!! i cant sleep..eat..do hw...do ne thing at all without thinkin about lorne!! omg, he just makes me soooo damn happy!! EEEEEKKKKKK!!!!!!! YAY!!!! lol hes called me 2 times today we've talked on the computer, its like we're always talking, but him not going to school with me sucks major ass. I WANT TO SEE HIM LIKE ALL THE TIME!! I love getting his cute lil offlines about how hes thinkin about me and stuff. It like i like. :D I like the way he sends me lil kisses when we talk and how he does the lil love smiley face and then says "xoxoxox" awwwww lol I love the way he looks at me i love the way he makes me feel period. Theres never a dull moment with Lorne. :) It all just seems too good to be true. I wrote earlier how freakin tired of i was being single and how i wish i was prettier or guys liked me more, and just when i want it the most it comes to me. Maybe it was meant to be that way. Tonite i HAD to tell lorne by cuz i had to do some hw and i cant do it while im talkin to him cuz..well...lol i cant think about ne thing else. So, it took me literally 15mins to say bye. haha everytime i said ok im going and send him a kiss he would say something and i would say something and we would just keep going back and forth. He kept doing his kissies and his hugs and his xoxoxo and his love smileies. He finally said "damn its hard to say bye to u" lol :D haha yeah, its hard to say bye to him too. It's like i could talk to him forever and hang out with him for EVER AND EVER. I really care about him and well his best friend added me tonite and said that lorne told him we were already dating. Um..i thought we were just "talking" but hey, i dont care!! Whatever lorne wants to think we are. lol Naw, he prob just told his friends that...idk...he told his little cousin that too. His little couins is 9 and has me on his list also. he popped up today and said "hey lornes girlfriend, i hear ur hot" lol yeah ok lil 9yr old. He then tells me how there is a lil girl in his class that looks like a monkey and i die laughing. i tell him to be nice because one day that monkey will be really pretty and he'll want to date her. his response to that was "you mean like you and lorne??" lol he then asks what i look like and tell him i look like a monkey. he argues with me for 5mins over if i look like a monkey or not. I say "yeah i do" he says "no you dont" he finally gives up and says  I KNOW U DONT LOOK LIKE A MONKEY CUZ LORNE SAID SO lol so i give in and say ok ok ok maybe im not a monkey. He was cute, but lorne thinks hes annoying. then this 9yr old started calling me babe and stuff and lorne got onto to him telling him he was gonna kick his tail if he messed with his girl...wow...HIS GIRL. im lornes girl!!! YAY!! lmao hehehehehehhehehehehehehehehehehe

      ok its 12am..and a school nite and i was in bed turning on my music to drift off to sleep when i started thinkin about the new guy in my life, lorne, then at made me think about lauren, and then that made me think about my blog and how she asked if i was going to write but i was too busy talkin away with lorne to write..so i decided i better do it, just because..idk lol WELL, this is how everything started: my friend kristen met this guy josiah and he wanted to go out on a date, and she cant go ne where alone so she always tries and hooks me up with one of his friends, well, ive never gone wtih her before on one of these outtings, but i heard the dudes name was lorne..thats a kickass name...lol so i decided i would go, cuz of his name. I then start talkin to lorne and we realized maybe this date which we were both dragged into wouldnt be all that bad. I start freakin out thinkin these things 1- hes gonna he really butt ass ugly and i wont care if he likes me or not (i wish he would have like cuz its fun having people like u) or 2- hes really super ass hot and he wont like me (most guys im into dont like me..lol) well kristen and i go to the mall and theres josiah and lorne. OMG lorne is FREAKIN HOT. and i was like..oh shit, hes not gonna like me what so ever. Josiah is freakin butt ass ugly, but hey, kristen asked for it and she got it. josiah nudegd Lorne and said "there she is..thats julia..go get her boy" and smiled at him and lorne returned with his lil grin. I really didnt know if that was a good thing or bad..but it pissed kristen off. Kristen was really jealous over lorne and hung out with him just as much as i did. We started goin around, me actually quiet for the first time because i froze up. Lorne was really nice and we laughed a lil here and there and maybe exchanged 5 sentences. WHOA!! i know. It was all because of this dude that josiah knew that kept following us around and freakin us out. His name was Hobo Jones. lmao He was sooo stoned it wasnt funny. Now, how bad can it get?? A  hot guy, an ugly guy, and a stoner with 2 lil sweet girls. haha yeah. exactly. so we left. oh and by the way, we stayed there a total of 35mnis exactly. THAT SUCKED. i wanted to hang out with lorne sooo bad even though i figured i didnt have a chance. WELL like every fairytale theres a twist. Kristens cell rang and it was the guys. they were really mad at Hobo (aka HOMO) and felt really bad about him not leaving us alone. We told them we would talk to them later. We got home after runnin around 601 and lorne called askin for me. We talked for about 2 hours on and off so kristen and josiah could talk also. I would talk to joe whenever kris had to go pee or something and he would tell me how much lorne was talkin about me and stuff...yay! i didnt know what to really say. When asked if lorne had a chance with me, i said no duh of course! and well joe then said "well when i asked him if he was intrested in u he said HELL YEA" lol haha ok, for a girl who get few to none guys, that was good, especially one that i liked back. The guys then went to get on the computer and we got on also. We didnt talk for long, but lorne changed the background to the falling hearts and when u buzz it makes a kissin noise and he kept doin it over and over again sayin that he was mad cuz he didnt get a kiss at the mall. Yeah..well...thats kinda weird with Hobo Jones gettin between u whenever u and ur dream guy get close...yeah Hobos suck major ass. The falling hearts were sweet. We then decided the computer was boring and he called again. Kristen was jealous again (letting me know this--she was a real bitch about it by sayin "gosh if it wasnt for me u wouldnt have met lorne") and she said "havent u talked to julia enough for one nite" that kinda pissed me off..but he said all he wanted to do was say goodnite so she basically threw her phone at me and said THERE  SAY GOODNITE!! but this goodnite convo turned into a full out 3hr one with kristens eyes rolling the whole time. She has this thing about puttin me down in front of people i or we like. She wouldnt stop callin me a whore and a bitch and a prep in front of lorne..some friend huh... I finally convinced lorne he needed to go to bed, but only after he asked me if we could do somethign this coming weekend and if i would go with him to his V-day dance. OMG!! lol i was like..thrilled. So i said yeah, i would be happy to. Josiah said he feel asleep with a smile on his face..awww. Well, kris and joe talked for like ever and i was basically asleep through their whole convo. We got off the phone about 4-5am. It was crazy. Then i get a phone call tonite from kristen saying "joe called me askin for ur number cuz lorne was about to kill him if he didnt find out what it was so we gave him ur number and he said he would call when he got home tonite from his cousins" OMG what am i suppose to say on the phone to lorne?! haha like when we talked at kristens, she was always doin something in the background we could laugh about and all..not alone with lorne on the phone! AHH lol Well, sure enough, 30mins later, he called. I programed his number into the caller id so it would show up LORNE when he called just like all my other friends. I pick up and he says.."hey is julia there?" andi  was like..hey! in my very fake happy tryin not to show im nervous voice. We talked about all kinds of things from my pet bird to cars, its always cars--he bulids muscle cars. Then i tell him i have to go finisih my world map and he tells me bye and that he'll get on the computer. Kristen then calls like seconds later and says..I JUST TALKED TO LORNE JULIA!!! and was like gettin details from both of us..ok thanks kris, but no thanks. He had told kris i need to stop be so nervous when he talked to me!! HAHA i wasnt nervous i swear!! yeah right...lol I denied it of course. Then i got online and we talked some more..about cars and stuff. lol he asked me if we were offically "talking" u know the step before dating..wow...lol ive made it this far in less than 2 days. he then tells me he "really really likes" me and how he feels like hes known me all his life because we're so much alike. :D yay! He then tells me im hot...ooookkk...hot, no. not me dammit. lol if u want hot, look at katie mckee, look at star miller, look at all the really pretty girls who get all the guys begging at their feet. Julia=Hot? no. i hate that word. i mean, yeah i was glad to hear he though me of all people was hot..but i would have been a lil better off with "pretty" or something a lil more mild. HOT?! NO. Just because idk..im insecure. Well, he called me hot like 5 times. He tells me hes crazy about me and how we need to go 4wheelin at his house soon and how so i dont mess up my clothes i can wear his old ones and mess up his. lol how sweet. a guy who knows i wont get muddy for nuttin is tryin to get me to go by offering his clothes haha. So i say yeah. Just because it gives us time to be together and its something he enjoys. A friend of mine from central then pops up..its meghan a girl who will always look out for others and tell you the truth. She tells me "a bunch of my friends dated lorne and all the sudden he just broke up with them and they got hurt, so i wouldnt date him" that scared me. I dont want to fall in "love" or totally dig him and he dump me outta the blue. I ask him the longest hes been with a girl and he says 8 months. Thats not too bad, so i decide im still gonna go on with him. He tells me how his last gf cheated on him and all this stuff and how he doesnt really like his girl hanging out with her guy friends alone. i have tons of guy friends...its like me and 2 other girls and then the rest are guys in my lil "group" . He knows that. He gets insanely jealous joe told me and will throw a fit. I can see where hes coming from, but what lorne doesnt know wont hurt his pretty lil face. haha i just wont metion my guy friends to him. He's already mentioned meeting my mom..gosh, couldnt he wait?! lol So, hes comin over friday nite with joe and kris to watch some movies. I thought we could just make other plans because he said he has to work (doin car stuff--he has a business) but then he decided he just wasnt gonna work because he wanted to come over and see me. AWWWW how sweet. So, i figured i would rent like 2 or 3 movies and we woulc hang out..but hes determined to make me watch 2 of his fave movies that ive never seen. lol so there goes my movies. He's bring 2 so i guess i will go pick up Donnie Darko LMAO. That might freak him out. haha It's a really cool movie though. Kris is comin over early to help me go rent a movie and get ready. Then lorne starts talkin about more kissing. lol He brings up that he didnt get his kiss so i send him one :-* and he says u forgot the :p lol yeah ok lorne. he has to have tounge?! umm..hey i thought that came at least after the like..5th kiss...haha at least. I really dont want a full out spit exchange when he comes over friday. So i guess i'll just drop the hint i like the sweet lil kisses. haha he takes hints well, thank god. He then asked if i didnt want him to kiss me. HELLO?! HES FREAKIN HOT. so i say.."haha i dont mind" and he said "ok i will then :D"  hes so cute. haha It's like he knows just what to say and what to do and he shows his emotions well with the admitting he likes me and stuff. Oh, and yeah he has a tattoo. lol its of a knights shield with a helmet (the helmet has his itinals on it MLB) and 2 swords going through the helmet all in front of flames. Now, i havent seen this tattoo..but ok. lol He does have really pretty eyes and WHITE STRAIGHT TEETH!! yay! lol And he works out too!! haha The only thing that bothers me is when i bring him to hang out with my friends..now, knowing lorne, and the type of guy he is (saying looks dont matter, but since im "hot" he gets a "pretty damn good bonus") he prob wont even mention katie..but katie has this way of gettin anything she wants..i dont want him to look at katie and wish i was like that...i dont want him to look at lauren or ne of my friends and think that. I know i know...it may seem stupid, but thats me. Well, i had to finish up my 20%max done world map. It only had the contients outlined..(damn that reminds me i gotta write a pantomine for tomorrow during 2nd period)  and i couldnt finish it while i was talkin to him. When lorne talks to me its not like he'll say one thing and then minimize it and talk to other people..its an on going thing. which is good i guess, but it didnt give me a chance to work. so by 11 i had to tell him goodnite and he told me to call him when i got home from school, i said i would..and i prob will. Nuttin is better than hearing "goodnite hun :-*" from a guy u really like. I do go through phrases where i will like a guy for a week and im over it, but Lorne is different. With lorne its like..its going somewhere. I know we'll date. He told me we would. YAY OOH and his little cousin added me and popped up saying "hey lornes gf" haha it was soo cute. Lorne told me to go invisible haha So we both went invisible, no tellin what he told his lil cousin. haha The word "girlfriend" has come outta his mouth 3 times in the last 2 days about me. So.."talkin" doesnt mean gf/bf..it means almost there...soo maybe we're REALLY almost there!! like really soon i'll be his offical GIRLFRIEND. damn i hope so. lol I'm fuckin tired of being single and hes a really awesome guy. Ok..i've spent exactly 41 minutes writting this and im sure lauren will have fun reading it..haha uh sorry hun!! lol adios!

      Tonite jordan and i talked about this girl he likes, her name is mandy and she goes to east surry. All his stats are about her, even if they are stupid, and she is all he talks about. We talked about her tonite, i was even shown a pic of her..shes pretty...prettier than me. The strange thing is though, they've never met in person. But they are going to the movies tomorrow nite. Luckly, i too have plans with a guy this weekend, so i was sure to tell him about my plans. During our conversation about miss mandy he stops it and asks if im still mad or dissappointed at him. He said that he was just wondering because things felt the way they used to between us. Use to..wow...used to...lets see, we we've been through many stages, so which used to is he talkin about? used to as in when we first met and he was a honry jackass? used to as when we got to know each other and began talking about serious things? used to as when he was depressed and i was there for him every nite to talk to? used to as when i liked him and he was a dick to me? used to...used to can mean so much, so i wouldnt advise using it. I know know what he meant, he meant as in before i was upset, as in before when we were good friends and nothing was wrong with the world when we talked. He didnt have to clarify which "used to", i just knew. I'm actually glad he found some chick he thinks hes crazy about, but it's asking too much when he tells me he would like us all to hang out. Yeah..that means me meeting miss mandy. I couldnt do that, it would just be too weird. Jordan knows that...but then again, i am his friend and he would want me to meet his gf, just like i would want him to meet my bf (if i even freakin had one), but that would just be to prove im not a total actionless loser..which i am...lol This may sound real stupid, but i just want someone that i can sit down with and he run his fingers through my hair...i look at katie and andrew, and andrew is always rubbing her back or playing with her hair..just that sense of sercurity that i know i have someone right there, so close i can feel the. yeah call me a freak, but it doesnt hurt to spend all ur time that a bf should take up thinkin about what you would do with ur bf, if u had one. It's prob more safe, you cant get pregant. Well, i guess i better go to bed just incase it doesnt snow..im already looking at 5 hours of sleep. lol nite!

      YAY!! i didnt have to go to school today! lol why?! cuz i was a "guest" for my mom's art classes, they were doing a lesson on birds and she was using my pet bird as the model, and he bites strangers without me haha so i was the bird handler. yay, i missed all my stupid ass classes. lol Jordan and i are fine, his last words today to me were "fine then fuck u" because i wouldnt go to the wrestling match (im a matmaid) to keep score, i couldnt not show up for school but then the stupid match. He can deal. He was just playing around ne ways..idk he then got offline. Oh well TDB. Kristen then begged me to go this weekend to meet these 2 guys..she gets on who she's been talking to and i get his friend..yay i always get the stupid friends, but hey i guess everyone has a friend..rite...well, he does have a kick ass name , so that made me want to go. Lorne. Thorne Lorne..haha that rhymes. I would have been a lot more excited about meeting him if kristen didnt go and tell his friend (the guy shes talkin to) that i was sweet and hot and a wild child. HELLO?! hot..um no...wild child...how about just not bright enought to understand what im doing LMAO..sweet...just maybe..to strangers at least. Kristen is always like..ohh ur so pretty i'm sure he'll like u!! uh shut ur fucking mouth. If i was sooo pretty kristen then i would have a freakin bf. Gah, i try but it never happens. Ne ways..i'm still going to the mall this weekend and she keeps refering to it as a "blind date" um..thats kinda weird. We're just hanging out. Who knows, maybe this guy is a real catch and i'm being superfical (i heard he had black/ dark brown hair..and usually i dont go for that). haha oh well, at least it adds a new guys list to my yahoo list. HAHA a new guy to talk to, so when someone asks who im talking to i can tell one more guys name..hahaha ok thats low, but it made me crack up. I did buy a new shirt today. i got it from marices and its purple and has a lavander stripe down the arms and it has some glitter on it..it's cute. It was on sale, only cost me like $11 some and it's long sleeved...stupid people already putting out spring and summer clothes. ne ways, i hope it snows..it better snow..i still have a map of the world to draw, lable and color...and a test to make up on it...damn.

      YAY!! Today was so much better than i think the whole week has been (it's only wednesday though). Today i turned 16!! YAY!! Overall today was just great...i understood alg 2, which is good for me since i can't do math haha and then Drama went well, i got to run around, be loud, and talk all i wanted to!! Lunch was better, i could finally eat. lol When i like a guy its hard for me to eat in front of them unless they're like one of my bestest buddies like andrew, andrew, trevor, zack, aaron, ect. My normal boys. And then i liked Jordan and he always sat near me at lunch, the table beside mine, facing me..eeek. lol i just couldnt eat. But since i dont like jordan like that anymore and i was tired of sitting through Hon World History hungry, i ate. lol Hon World History took forver and i basically just sat there. I still have about 75% of my World Map to draw and lable, oh and color oh and study. haha i'm screwed. Spanish went good today, we had about 30mins+ of free time and since katie was gone, and hate to say it..but even catherine wood was gone, i had no one to talk to but andrew gitt and preston. Hey, that's not all that bad. haha We talked about driving and stuff and Preston explained his sketchbook to me. :D lol he's so hot. He has a really pretty smile. I did get my report card today and well..it sucks...as usual, but jordan went to get his at the same time and he was standing right beside me and couldnt even look at me or say hey..uh ok thanks jordan. so i elbowed him lol he elbowed me back...stupid fuck. he can go suck a fuck. lol Today in drama i got to be a thug and look for some spinners. yay!! lol it wasnt one of those things that are planned...i suddenly took on the role of a thug who wanted spinners. It was prob one of the first roles where i havent died laughing and gone outta character. I was proud lol . I HOPE IT SNOWS TOMORROW!!! :D

      This song is one i am always playing. I think the lyrics are beyond well written and i'm sure everyone has felt this way at one time or another even if it's about your best friend. Life goes by all too fast to get too busy to say that thought or words or to dance on the kitchen floor, we all have someone who makes everything all right. "Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly But with you I can spread my wings"  When I Look To The Sky-----Train   When it rains it pours and opens doors And floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love That have to say goodbye   And as I float along this ocean I can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let me go   Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me And you make everything alright  And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me And I can always find my way when you are here   And every word I didn't say that caught up in some busy day And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't dance before And every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all up in a kiss And pick you up in all of this when I sail away   Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly But with you I can spread my wings to see me over everything that life may send me  When I am hoping it won't pass me by   And when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me there you are to show me

      I called kaela today and told her about what jordan said to me. She flipped out and was egar to get a hold of his sorry ass. She just couldn't believe how low he stooped and what all he said to his "good friend". Yeah, i cant wait for her to make him feel like shit, even more than i have. But, then..after all the anger and all the tears and all the hate jordan and i manged to fix it all tonite. He pops up with his innocent like nothing ever happened "Hey". Yeah, i told myself i wouldnt talk to him tonite, but i didnt think he would have enough guts to even speak to me first. I say hey. He then asks what i'm up to and i tell him Alg 2 hw..not my normal answer, but remember, im supposed to be pissed off. He says hes not doing anything ( i didnt even return the "sup?", shows how much he pays attention) and he tell me he's going to do pre cal hw. I say cool. Another thing i usually dont say, just reminding myself to keep my cool. He then gets the nerve to ask how my day went..HOW MY DAY WENT?! uh it was hell. Considering i only got 3 hrs of sleep because of u and every time i thought about u i got mad again and how at lunch i cant eat or think because uve made me so damn mad and i can see u laughin with ur gay ass friends. But, i just tell jordan, "yeah...i guess" 20 mins go by and there's nothing...i know he thinks im mad at him, i want him to. i want him to feel like shit some more. I then finally ask how his day went, he said good but boring almost instantly, he must have been thinking of something to say to break the silence or waiting for me to say something. It's always fun when you know you have someone on their tiptoes. I then all the sudden say this "u know i dont really wanna talk about it right now, but u know things arent really ever gonna be the same and i figured i prob wouldnt even talk to u tonite..but i guess i did.." and he gives me this sad face and says "see i knew u were mad at me" Yeah..he was right. I was mad. But then he guesses why exactly im mad and he says something that makes no sense, so i tell him the real reason and i say " im pissed off because i was thinkin about how u said we were "good friends" and u totally risked our friendship by gettin so low u just had to tell me u liked kaela. i mean, u could have kept it to urself considering that she isnt single and has a bf u know..so u totally put that all out on the line like u didnt care and its not like u and kaela were gonna hook up or ne thing, she has a bf!! so u could have kept it to urself and u should have, knowing it would hurt one of ur "good friends" " He calls me harsh. I want to call him a dick, but then he calls me Bozo...lol Yeah, so what..he makes me smile, even when im mad. It makes no sense to me. Then i say something i would never think to say, but it just came out so damn naturally and i cant take it back no matter how hard i really try, but i said " lol i cant be mad at u jordan..i can be pissed yea..but i cant be mad, just cuz i usually dont get mad u know...just think next time and dont be such a dick lol but at least now u can like and talk about ne girl u want and i wont care haha so thats good..i guess lol " He gives a smily and i say " is that a smile cuz im not mad or cuz u dont have to worry about me liking u?? lol" and his reply is "cus im glad u said u weren't mad at me that shows that ur a true friend" Yeah. Ok. I'm a true friend...yeah I AM but what about you?! jordan has a lot of learning to do and i cant blame him, hes a guy..guys are just like that. I think. But he doesn't get another chance. I hope he thinks more next time. I really wanted a long ass "im sorry". I guess i didnt get it but oh well...maybe kaela will make him feel so bad i get one in the long run. hahaha Hey, long ass "im sorry"-ies are great..it lets u know ur loved or at least loved enough where a bunch of bullshit is made up to make you happy. hahaha I guess it's too early in life to hate people and to spend my days mad at some stupid guy because he said something uncalled for. I have lost all "boyfriend" feelings for him though, those will never come back. I hate that too. Jordan liked almost everything i liked and we thought on the same level and thought about a lot of the same things and had a bunch of the same views. That sucks too. But it will be a cold day in hell before i can ever like him again after that. Who knows...it's winter and i bet hell gets cold too. Well, after things are better and worked out he asked me if i need any alg 2 help tonite, because usually i'll ask him for help. But i had already asked aaron, i wasnt going to ask jordan for anything at the time, but hey it made me smile, once more. How do i do that?! i got from mad pissed off julia who wants to scream and cry to smiling julia who just doesnt want to be mad at anyone. "(s)hes a brick and im drowning slowly off the coast and im headed no where" shit happens. i'm tired of shit happening. EAT SHIT!! LOL ok...now im better, i at least hope so. I'll be 16 in 1 hr and 20mins. YAY!!

      Last nite i wanted to get on and scream some more about how hurt i was about jordan, not really hurt..yea, i guess hurt..but i was more than hurt at the time, i was really mad. But, thanks to blogger...they were closed for construction...so, without it i stayed up until 2:30am in tears because...just a mixture of emotions. I got less than 3 hours of sleep that nite and was still mad enough to fuel myself for the rest of the day..well, maybe it was just because everyone execpts to see this happy girl all the time and when you lie to yourself and others you kinda turn into that i guess. I would find myself thinkin about how this guy i had liked so much, the first guy i didnt look at one day and say "omg hes so hot im gonna chase him", hes not even hot honestly...it was just we clicked in so many different ways he was almost just like me. I dont even know how to explain it. After a lot of thinking and crying it hit me why i was so pissed off..it wasnt because he liked my best friend and a girl he could NEVER get with because of her love for her current boyfriend and she has no intrest in him what so ever besides being friends, but it was because of the potenal of ruining our friendship. He took that step that could have caused me to drop all feelings for him, even as a friend and end it all there, over something he cant have...i wouldn't risk a friendship over something i couldnt have or get. It just made me feel really used and like i was just something for entertainment. Yeah, he said "we're really good friends and i dont want to fuck our friendship up" yeah..well u said some pretty fucked up things and it hurt me..do u think i'll honestly look at you the same again?! Guys make no sense. Just when you think you have everything going for you and things are looking brighter your "good friend" puts you in 2nd place over someone he's only known for a week max and has only seen once, and it will prob be the last time. damn..part of me just wants to kick and scream and cry and tell him how much i hate him, and then the other part of me wants him to hug me while i do it and let me get it all out and then tell me how everything will be ok. It's weird..idk how to explain it, i just know it sucks major ass. It's hard for me to hate people and its hard to make me mad..but he did it. he did something only a few people have managed to do. I dont think he understands, yeah, he told me i made him feel like shit..but how does he think he made me feel?! i felt like shit stepped on twice. I want this perfect guy who will be there for me and not lead me on and not even think about liking my best freakin friend or any of my friends. Yeah, he told me he didnt like kaela like that..he swore to me...then the next day his excuse for lieing was "i didnt want to hurt your feelings" bullshit..u could have been honest with me and i might have taken it a little better. But yeah, he also cares about me and my feelings...yeah ok. He sure does show it. It's not the fact that he doesnt like me the way i once liked him, its the fact that he risked our friendship..like it meant nothing to him. OVER SOMETHING HE CANT OR WONT EVER HAVE. Oh well, i decided i was gonna make him feel like a total dick and like shit. So tonite when he gets his sorry ass online and pops up and says "hey" like nothing ever happened (cuz according to him we should just forget..how can something like this be forgotten?! hello i still remember 2nd grade) i prob wont talk too much and it will get him wondering..and then i'll end up snapping and letting him have it like the little girl kicking and screaming with tears running down her face, i'm the same girl but with mascara to follow. I'm growing up, but i still want that little girl. I want that worry free blonde child whose only concern is if she gets that piece of candy at the checkout after she's been good while momma shopped. I dont want to worry about grades, school, realtionships. I dont want to grow up just yet. I want to stay behind..and maybe that's why some say im so immature. I am immature, i can be serious at times..but why waste lifes good moments being so damn serious? One day there will be a time where i will have to be almost all but immature, so i want to be immature while i can. I want to live my life with no regrets. I want to hold on to so many things, but most of them are already out of reach. Well, tomorrow is my 16th birthday and i should be excited..wow 16!!! i've always looked forward to it. But, honestly..i'm just not in the mood for it. Maybe tomorrow i will be...but idk. I hope so at least. I hope tonite things get better with jordan and i hope kaela talks some sense into him and i want him to say hes honest to god sorry and give me the biggest apology imaginable. I want him to honestly be pretty damn sorry. He hurt me. It reminds me of the time Trevor pulled something simimlar, execpt it wasnt my best friend..it was just me. He told me he didnt mean "lylas" when he told me and how i didnt mean ne thing to him...yeah...that hurt worse than having jordan like kaela and not me, but trevor and i moved on..and we're ok today, as ok as i'm sure we will ever be. Things just flow better when i can type them out while listening to a song (100 years by five for fighting). "the sun is getting high, we're moving on" I wish i saw a bunny like donnie darko....

      Okay...i hate numbers, i hate guys, i hate people sometimes just in general!! UGH It's just life can get so confusing and its like no one fully understands AND THEN LIFE GETS WORSE. im always in freakin 2nd place with my friends.."ooh, ur katie that hot girl's friend" im fucking tired of it. and it gets worse..u tell a guy u like that u actually like them..putting ur heart out on the line, wearing it on ur sleeve...and just when things look good...and ur happy...and ur smiling..he crushes u, i mean..he runs ur heart (and ur sleeve) lol over with a fucking steam roller. WHY?! CUZ HE LIKES UR BEST FRIEND. he likes her, not u. how many times has that happened to me?! too many. I'm tired of being single, im tired of not having a bf there for me or having one to drag along with my friends..it's like im doomed with guys for the rest of my life. IM FREAKIN ALMOST 16!! and the more i say.."it doesnt matter ne more..it doesnt matter ne more.." the more it matters to me. it just gets to me sooo damn much. Like, idk..im almost in tears..its not even funny. What jordan did just hurt so damn much. I guess thats what u get when u put urself out on the line and get run over by steamrollers...lmao if that made ne sense. Sometimes i just feel like im not good enough or not whatever enough, like i'm never going to be good or live up to anything great. I dont know what to do with my life, i have tons of dreams and goals, but they seem just all outta reach. Now, as tears run down my face, and i have to admitt to jordan that he hurt me, and share my feelings and be honest..it hurts..it hurts more, cuz usually i can laugh and people think im ok..but im not ok, i get upset too, i have feelings too...im human too. I want people to freakin understand that. I want someone to tell all of that too, and lauren, ur about the only one who i think i can tell. Not even kaela.. Life sucks ass sometimes...

      UGH okay, my pup Leah is being sooo ugh! lol okay, how can a puppy be ugh? WELL when she finds a hole in ur fence (when ur mom makes u stick her in the fenced in yard while u leave for the day with the other dog) and goes into the neighbors fenced in yard with their 2 HUGE dogs. Alright..so i had to chase her around until i caught her, not exactly, she found a drain pipe thingie and goes into it every time i go near her. Some dog...she loves me...yeah. lol im sure. UGH i swear when i catch her shes gettin a bath cuz she STINKS still and shes gonna stay in her crate and not go outside!! ugh. lol i'll take her out on a leash for her to go to the bathroom geez, but im not chasing her to timbuktu and back. She just needs to be socialized..fuck who ever left her in a pin all by herself and didnt play with her. Poor pup, all she knows is dogs and not people. :( OH WELL. i'm gonna make this thing into a good dog even if she only wags her tail when my other dog walks into the room instead of me...

      yay!! i caught my puppy!! haha yeah. I went to tractor supply and got some doggy shampoo and wanted to get wormer but they were out so i went to walmart and got some more food and wormer and i saw some glitter dog shampoo and it wasnt fair cuz my mom wouldnt let me buy that stuff since we had already gotten this nasty green stuff for her fur. lol it was cool though, and mom wants me to give her a bath once and week at least so she stays clean and gets used to being bathed. Shes gonna be so cute!! I wanna get her a hot pink collar with reinstones or spikes. haha i think hot pink with sliver spikes would be sooo cute!! haha Shes gonna be a bad ass bitch, litterally. lol Shes so cute!! i just love her to death!! The funny thing is, i dont like dogs..at all, unless they are the cute little indoor ones, like laurens. lol But, i have always wanted a german shephard and sure enough one came up and needed a home. So yay! lol i gave her a bath and dried her with my hairdyer and filed her claws because shes been kept up and her claws were too long. So, shes all fixed up now. :D Shes sleeping in this crate/cage thingie on the porch, i really wanna bring her in, but we just wormed her and shes gonna have to go to the bathroom sometime or another. lol Shes very anti-social, we can tell shes prob. never been really held and she doesnt answer to me when i call her, so i cant let her go out in the yard right now. I think i'm gonna give it about 3 or 4 days until i do that. Shes so cute!! haha ok. i got my new pet..yay!

      ***Here's a good song*** It was in the movie The Perfect Score and being the dork i am when i heard it i got out a pen and paper and wrote down some of the lyrics so when i got home i could search them...   Last Way Out Of Here by Paloalto.    Running faster through the trees Feeling nothing underneath Your eyes are opened wide Let it come in Looking for the laughter show Is it out there anymore? Your head is lifting up to see how far to run  And you're feeling who you are And you don't care who it is How do you feel? And you're barely wonderful And you don't care if it hurts How do you feel? It's the last way out of here  Falling backwards Broken knees Waiting to be in between You lay just where you are Feeling amused Yelling, screaming on the floor Louder than you were before You might just bite your tongue When you're reaching for the world  And you're feeling who you are And you don't care who it is How do you feel? And you're barely wonderful And you don't care if it hurts How do you feel? It's the last way out of here  When all your walls are down When all your walls are down There's love  And you're feeling who you are And you don't care who it is How do you feel? And you're barely wonderful It's the last thing that you think And you're feeling who you are And you don't care if it hurts And you're feeling loved That you can't hang on It's the last way It's the last way  Stop to think (when all your walls are down) When all your walls are down Then there's love You take in what you give in When all your walls are down When all your walls are down Then there's love It's the last way out of here

      This morning has been very interesting! First my mom comes in my room and literally digs through everything to find my black boots to borrow..She tells me my room is disgusting, oh well, don't diss my shit when ur borrowing things from me, I think she knew that though cuz she didnt say much. She goes to church and comes home all while im still asleep. When she gets home she says "hey go look at the puppy outside" I HATE DOGS, but a puppy sounded like fun so i get up and run outside to see this puppy she's talking about, and knowing my mom, she wouldnt get me up to see an animal if she didnt want me to go get it so we can keep it...so i knew it was a stray. I go out there and there is this beautiful little puppy but as i walk towards it, she runs away. UGH i sat out there in the cold in my pjs feeding it dog treats trying to get it to come to me...didnt work. Mom told me it looks EXACTLY like a dog she loved that she had as a child when she actually lived down the road from where we live now, u can see her childhood house from ours now. haha so yeah, she wants this dog but wants me to catch it and play with it and it be my dog (she doesnt wanna make it seem like SHE wants it, her kids do) haha my mom and animals. Well, i then set up barricades in the neighbors yard cuz it was going under their little kid's fisher price tool bench. It got trapped and just when i touched the pup, she made a sound like a goat and it scared me! haha so of course i backed away and she ran away. She keeps coming back to the food and water i put out. I'm giving her a break but its about time i corner her and just chase her around until i can catch her because shes so skinny and needs a bath. Mom told me her dog like that was the best dog in the world and she called him Leo, i told her we can name this one Leah. I thought it was cute and she smiled. I usually dont like dogs, but this one is a puppy and it's really cute. She looks to be a shepherd/collie mix, or a shepherd/chow mix, we gotta see her tongue to tell, chows have blue tongues no matter what. She is definitely a Shepard because of her markings. My mom said she looks to be about 4 months old. Shes so cute!! i want her! lol I want to get a pink leash and run around the neighborhood with her. My other dog Molly won't do that, but Molly is a good dog and i love on her and play with her too. And she needs a friend..and my mom wants this dog. lol My cat Willie just walked by and it reminded me when he chased the puppy when it came in the yard. My big fat orange cat that was bottle fed by me chased the dog! lol it was a funny site, almost as funny as Molly (a little yippy blue heeler) trying to outdo the rotylier (spell?) next door in the other yard. Theres a chain-link fence between them. lol its funny to see. I hope i catch little miss leah...

      UGH GRRRR OMG HELLO GET A FUCKIN CLUE!! okay this is what just happened...im talkin to joe and he invites me to this party at tom's house (oh yay..ugh not) and i dont even know these people personally but joe and lorne. I tell him that and hes like "well me and lorne are gonna be there" I DONT WANNA SEE LORNE. He then tells me that lorne REALLY wants to talk to me face to face about things, dammit...not right now, not on valentines day, i dont wanna think about that stupid mother fuckin shit. WELL i tell him im busy on v-day so i cant go. he asks what im doing and i say "what people do on v-day duh" and he asked if i was going to a dance and i said no. he wont stop asking me what im going to do. so then he asks "well who u gonna be with?" and i say "does it matter?--no." he told me it mattered to him who i was spending valentines day with and to a "certain someone" fuck that. fuck lorne. come on lorne!! dont u see, i dont wanna talk to u about "us" there is no "us" there isnt going to be, not after u said the things u said and what i get when i talk to u. NO. dammit. never. UGH GRRRR I dont wanna be in a strangers house with a bunch of guys and then there be lorne--and god knows i dont wanna hang around him, so i would fine someone else (not joe either) and then lorne would get mad and it would ruin the whole thing. i mean, having lorne see me with one of his friends might be entertaing and a ton of fun, but not at toms house, not on valentines day--no, not with lorne period. i dont wanna see him or think about him right now. ugh. why cant  he see that?! he doesnt make an effort to talk to me and when i ask him what hes thinkin or how he feels about things, he doenst answer, changes the subject or says "i really dont wanna talk about it". FINE THEN, we wont talk about it. AND I DONT WANNA TALK ABOUT IT NOW cuz im done with it all..end of story. get it through ur fucking head (even though it is nice to have someone like u enough to chase after u like this...)

UGH how stupid am i?! well i figured cat wouldnt be bright enough to look at his profile, since i dont usually look at profiles and im brillant haha, well she did...i guess hes smarter than i thought. BUT seeing his ugly ass face, she still wants to meet him in person! AHHH what is wrong with her?! SHE MUST BE A FUCKIN ALIEN DEPRIVED OF ALIEN SEX IF SHE WANTS HIM! AHHH EW GROSS *BARF-A-TRO-IOUS* yuck. well, still--people do look different in person at times, i know i do, so im still waiting to see her face next weekend (if all works out) when we go to the mall. MUAHAHAHAH *evil face* She cant stop talking about him. Joe this joe that, joe is awesome, joe is perfect, joe likes singing in the rain, unc, and art AND hes not gay...well no shit, of course hes not gay, wait..i take that back, i bet hes gay and is just lookin to be seen with anyone to make people think hes into girls. THATS WHY HES FRIENDS WITH GAY LORNE. there we go!! lol like i said, im brillant. :D I asked cat if joe was cutier than charlie, a guy she had talked to a long time ago, and knowing that charlie is prob HOTNESS compared to joe, cat said "umm apples and oranges" OMG she went on for DAYS about how ugly charlie was, and im going on for DAYS about how ugly joe is...but hey, this boy is ugly. I may sound mean but then again i never said i was the hottest thing on this earth, but i would be compared to joe. I guess my point is that i was trying to be mean to cat and my plan failed. NOW i really want them to hook up and be happy...and i wanna meet this jonathan dude that goes to central and ( i didnt know this at the beginging but hes friends with Lorne..opps) I saw him on his cam and hes such a cutie!!! hes a freshman, but he doesnt look like one. Oh well, who cares anymore? He would just have to be AT LEAST 15. Thats all i want cuz some 10th graders are still 15. NOT 14, HE CANT BE 14! lol I think i mentioned in a previous blog that joe told me lorne would kill jonathan if he ever got involved with me--all the better. it would make lorne hate me :D yay.

      ok...tonite kinda sucked ass. 1) lauren is upset cuz of will. he didnt say anything to her about her offline and she thinks he doesnt like her. i dont know what to think but i really wish i had the fuckin right words to say to her to make her feel alright. oh well, she knows im lookin for those words and i guess the thought counts. lol 2) LORNE. his buddy joe was tellin me how lorne still cares and shit and im like I DONT CARE. I WANT HIM TO HATE ME I WANT HIM TO THINK "FUCK HER, SHES A BITCH" WHENEVER HE HEARS MY NAME EVEN IF SOMEONE MEANS JULIA ROBERTS OR JULIA STILES I WANT "JULIA" TO MAKE HIM THINK HATE. I got what i wanted...i didnt want him to care. i wanted him to hate me and not give me that second chance i really wanted a week ago, even a few days ago. I told myself after seeing what he said about me, "hell no not now", i made myself believe -- no gonna like him and im gonna end it right this second, no more feelings for him. and once i decieded that i havent gone back to feeling the same way. i know joe says i need to put myself in lornes shoes, and yeah...i know what he means, but hey- if i like someone i wouldnt say "hell no not now" after them trying to make things work, fuck him. lol and joe is makin me feel bad cuz i just have a conversation with some dude. i dont care if lorne gets mad cuz i talk to some other guy, get over urself lorne. damn bitch. lol ok now i sound like lauren. hahaha I'm lonely again, but i dont want lorne...make sense? no? didnt think so.   ok the good thing about today was....MY SOCCER CLEATS CAME IN YAY!! I LOVE THE UPS DUDE! They're sooo fuckin awesome!! :D :D :D :D I showed ashley a picture of them online and she said "arent u suppose to get blue and white ones?" everyone i asked told me it didnt matter. and i overheard some girl had gotten hot pink ones or something over the summer. god...it better not matter. it was $85 for tie dyed cleats...haha but i love 'em!!   oh and i made a 59.9 on my progress report in alg. 2...yay...lol

      *I'm so proud of Lauren! She really stepped up and told a guy she liked him. Wow..im amazed at one minute, but im not surprised the next. She is her own person and i love that about her. She is amazing in everything she does (get ya mind outta da gutter) and i love how she doesnt care what others think. She's really something. :D love ya girl.*  I'm sitting here talking to Mikel. He tells me he saw his friend Brad Gentry at walmart. Brad and i go to school together but yet i dont personally know him but he's in my spanish class. He starts talking about this "cheerful blonde girl" and the more the conversation goes on about this "girl" mikel realizes its me he's talking about. haha   Mikel: He just mentioned this cheerful little blonde girl. He didn't know your name, but we talked for a while, and I'm like "WAIT is it Julia ?" and he's like "Yea, okay, that's the girl"  haha well i guess he wasn't talking bad about me, he doesnt even know me, and mikel wouldnt have mentioned it if he was talking shit..lol but hey, i like it when people say good things about me to people they dont think know me!! hahaha   Jordan is going over to my friend sarah sampson's house to see her friend amber, this new chick he likes. He wanted me to go but hes going after 9 and he cant drive past 9 so his mom is taking him. dammit..i cant go now cuz i figured he would drive me, but nooo, and my mom isnt going to take me to sarah's house all the way in dobson in the middle of the night. I dont know his mom but what mom takes her kid out at 9 about 30mins away and then turns around to go get him in a few hours...dude...lol he is the only child. i guess that has something to do with it. I betcha he doesnt even get to go..hahaha that would be funny. i do want to go with him , so maybe he'll change his mind and go one afternoon to her house to meet amber. I just want to go so i can see how they get along together! haha   I've finally decided i'm offically OVER Lorne. I don't think about him anymore and i've already told Kristen that i dont like him. IT'S OFFICAL. I'm glad he said he didnt care, takes more off my mind. i havent talked to him at all today.  One more day until my daddy comes out!! yay!!! Going to the mall...going shopping...getting to see him...YIPPEEE!! I need a boyfriend. lol

      UGH fuck katie fuck katie fuck katie. i swear, ive never heard of a friend stabbing their own friends in the back in the exact same way she does. dammit..i swear. its like katie has to prove herself, that she can get a guy and take over and lauren cant. fuck her!! (im singing fuck her lol) anyways, i know u can take over and get Will, Lauren. B-E AGRESSIVE!! B-EAGRESSIVE!! haha i know he likes u, what is there not to like? hes admitted to people he freakin likes u, so i dont know what the problem is. I think katie is VERY jealous because even though she has a bf and has HAD one, she still wants to be that one step above you, but u know, shes never above you, not even close to it, ur so much more mature than her (hahahaha) and you listen and understand people and that's something katie will never be able to do. It's like shes superficial or something, i dunno. ( i love her to death but ya know..) B-E AGRESSIVE!  Okay, lorne gets home and i talk to him..but before i talk to him kristen has to go and talk to him and tell him that i want him back and all this shit and stuff and im like..HELLO-that was DAYS ago and i dont want him back. his friend keeps pushing the subject and i think from what i saw of kristens copying and pasting that lorne made it clear that he doesnt want to try it again. his words were "hell no not now" and that he as a "little bit" of feelings for me. why waste my time on someone who likes me a LITTLE BIT? oh well...i dont know whats gonna happen, and i really dont care right now. Lorne used to be the first thought of the day and the last thought of the day and now hes no thought of the day and if i think about him its just because it was nice to have someone to snuggle with, i do miss that. fuck everyone who thinks i HAVE to like lorne again. I wish people would fuckin drop it.   Last nite my mom woke up to our gate rattling, like someone was tryin to open it and she looked out her bedroom window and saw nothing (u can see that area of the house from her room) so she thought she was dreaming and went back to bed. That was at 5:30am. we get up this morning and my dog is back in the yard. i be damned..lil fucker mike brought our dog back, gee thanks, she wasnt urs to fuckin take anyways. Just creeps me out that hes been here, hes walked in our yard and has come near our house. I cant believe i lived in the same house as him. oh well, screw that.   I stayed up all last nite talking and didnt go to bed until 2:30am and i figured we wouldnt have school, but u know what..we did...a 2 hour delay. shit. i was so tired and i was really tired eariler but i have to do my homework, and that was 8:30pm and now its 11:02pm..and i still havent done my homework. lol But ive managed to talk to people, listen to music, oh and fuck, i just forgot to watch a new episode of The Real World..damn...it came on at 10:30....oh well, i'll catch it later. Anways, i really need to atempt my homework...nite

      ok..maybe tonite wasnt so damn great. Okay, recapping...my ex-stepdad isnt suppose to be near our house or contact us what so EVER and well..this morning he was watching us all leave for school and my mom for work..and he stole our dog. Yeah..he stole my dog. So, i went down to the police station at like 10pm cuz thats when my mom finally decided to report it and come to find out in NC u get 10years in jail if you steal a dog, and he doesnt need any more years racked up than he already has- if they can find him. Gee, what a life. Anyways, so my dog is gone..poor molly..and to make things worse the SHERRIF comes by the house today looking for mike, and well..mike doesnt live here anymore and hasnt..hes not suppose to. well, he leaves after a short Q&A session with my mom. A cop hasnt stopped by lookin for him since november when this all went down. anyways, we go to the police station and while we were waiting there was a mouse in the lobby..aww it was so cute. 30mins later, its dead..cuz this young cop (about 20) was showing off and played "hero" and STOMPED on the sleeping mouse in a corner...ew. its guts splated on the window and made a squishie noise...i yelled DAMN. lmao he laughed and acted like he was all proud, he then put lil mighty mouse in the trash can beside me so i got up and moved. I told him i was anti-killing-mice. he laughed. what a dip shit! haha ANYWAYS, we got everything filed and all that good stuff and well...my dog is gone, but at least shes not out alone in this world being kicked around..she's warm and taken care of. I hope we get her back, but i highly doubt it. stupid fucker mike. I hope he rots in hell. WELL, while all this is going on with molly missing and us noticing, my dad calls. He wanted to talk to mom about visiting, mom was too upset, so i had to explain to my dad why she was upset and that her and mike were no longer together. he found out only last week in an email. Mom and john drove around the neighborhood looking for molly while i sat on the couch with roberta eating chocolate ice cream, i know that sounds pretty damn sorry but i was upset and i knew my mom needed space. Im not going to mention this to any of my friends, about molly and all. They dont understand, they dont have a piece of paper that says someone who was once related to them cant come within 100 yards of them, cant look at them, cant speack to them, cant do anything that has to do with them unless its through a lawyer or cop. They didnt have police driving around their house every hour to make sure that person wasnt bothering their family. Normal families dont have that shit go on. I'm glad hes gone..im really honestly glad. fuck him. all those years i needed that father figure and he wasnt it, he told me he loved me once and thats the first time i saw him after he married my mom. I didnt love him, but its good to hear someone loves u, especially ur dad and at the time hes all i had on a day to day basis. fuck him. All the times he yelled at me for no damn reason and all the times he told me i was stupid and needed to shut the hell up and needed to be quiet at 8pm when he went to bed. fuck u mike, damn if i ever have anything to do with him again i'll kill myself. It still brings tears to my eyes about how unhappy i was for all those years. Here was this man trying to be someone and something he could never be. He was no where close to being a "dad" to me. I needed one...i really did. I needed that hug when i got home from school, i needed that..i used to always have that until my parents divorced. It still hurts..i swear, divorce on kids is hard. It caused me to not get along with my mom, it caused a lot of anger and frustration, it caused a lot of saddness and depression, and just until 6th grade did i turn out the way i am today. and i still struggle. I struggle to keep the thoughts of the past outta my head, i struggle not to cry when i get an email from my dad telling me how much he loves me, why didnt i have that every fuckin day growing up? I wouldnt classify my childhood has bad or hard..but emotionally draining, yes. Ive never held so much hate against one person as i held for mike. The one figure i needed the most didnt care. I needed him to at least try to be a dad to me. No, instead he screamed and yelled and acted like a total idiot. Those things will never leave my memories but i hope one day i can make peace with it all. I'm just too angry from 6-7 years ago. Damn...several years ago and i still hold that anger. 9 or 10 years ago my parents divorced, and it took 6 years for me to deal with it. I'm glad mike is gone, but it's gonna take a lot longer to get over everything he caused me to feel. fuck fuck fuck i hope he burns in fuckin hell. ok..i feel better...  okay, and today i go to the store with mom and she lets me and bros go in the store and pick out whatever we want to eat for that week, its usually chicken, frozen pizzas, chips and a lot of junk food and nothing thats not usually frozen. WELL, i made myself pick out only healthy things that contained less than 5 grams of fat..haha Instead of my usual 12pack of diet cokes i got a 12 pack of bottled water...instead of my chips i got carrot sticks and baked chips. Everything of mine was less than 5 grams...yup yup...i'm so on the biggest diet kick. i swear its addictive. dont let ur kids diet!! haha I feel like i cant eat anything unless i pop another diet pill or count the calories. At school i tend to forget about my pills or whatever...but i think i'll try harder to remember. oh, and i've been running anywhere from 1-2 miles every other day..yay...haha trying to be more healthy, yup that's me. :D at least i can say im trying..right??

      yay school got out early!! WOOOO WHOOOOO!!! Oh, thanks lauren for that little bit of happiness about how liz and ashley and mikel...yeah....lol it's just hes such a great guy and we're friend and if anyone ANYONE is gonna date that boy it's gonna be me! AHHH THE PANTHERS LOST!! AHHHH The whole CBS thing sucked because one, they didnt show any panther stuff, it was all for them damn yankees (just had to be somewhat surry county there...) two, they never showed the panther cheeleaders, im not saying i like to look at them, but i noticed it because they kept showing the Patriots cheerleaders and one got up in the camera with real yellow crooked teeth-go eat some more lobster bitch. LMAO ok. The game overall was a really good close game (cuz im sure u didnt see it..uh who wouldnt watch it?!) I ate WAY TOO much and i decided i wasnt going to eat a whole bunch, or just rather say, start a new diet at least this whole week, but i go and eat pizza and fries and a stupid chocolate cookie...eeeek. I'm going to walmart soon so maybe i'll spend all my lunch money so i cant eat this week at school HAHA My dad is coming out this weekend and im excited!! YAY!! The older i get the more i enjoy seeing my dad, at first it was like YAY hes coming out so i can go shopping (he'll buy me whatever i want..which is ok..well GREAT) but the older i get the less i think about materalistic things and i just focus on, wow...i get to see my daddy and i havent seen him since summer. He's 56 and hes been driving the 8 hour drive to see me and my brothers for the last 6 or 7 years. He even drove to Kansas once to get us and drive us back to TN. It was a 28 hour trip...not counting stops for food and sleep and stuff...it was the worest trip in the car ever, and it was even worse when we had to drive back to KS!!! The reason he drove out to get us and take us back to his house for the summer?? Cuz i threw a fit (i was maybe 9) and i wanted to see my dad and go back "home". Makes me really cherrish the time i get with my dad because i dont get to see him much, and one of these days hes not going to be able to drive that 8 hour trip whenever he wants. One day i'm going to have to drive that 8 hr trip (oh i know i'll take a friend lol) and see him. Oh well...i love him and im excited about him coming to visit!! YAY!! Lorne supposedly got home yesterday from california...big whoop. I dunno..i'll know how i really feel when i actually talk to him. Im doubtful actually. lol

      Julia, your subconscious mind is driven most by Love   Everyone has a desire to love. But your desire is rooted very deeply in your unconscious and affects many of the decisions you make in life — whether you are aware of it or not.   You have an energy about you that inspires people to experience their true feelings of love and act kindly towards others. In this way, you and your drive for loving relationships start a chain reaction of positive experiences.   The reason you are driven by love, may be because your unconscious is trying to avoid the opposite of love — hate. You, more than others, may be afraid of experiencing severe discord with others. That may, in turn, heavily influence your choices about relationships and the way you communicate your ideas, wants, and desires to others.   With such a strong orientation towards loving others, your relationships hold a very special place in your life. Your capacity to love may be greater than those around you, and therefore you may have more to give in relationships than your romantic partner does. Remember that this is a gift you have and one most others don't possess.   Though your unconscious mind is driven most strongly by Love, there is much more to who you are at your core.

      YAY!! im bacccck!!! haha i've been allowed to get on the computer a lot more lately, :D yay!!! anyways, i was just reading laurens blog, yes, from the last date back in feb. up til the present. I really hate not seeing lauren in school and talking to her about how much we hate katie and catherine and how much we hate katie liking will and andrew and anything else with man organs and how we hate...a lot of stuff and then we crack up at ourselves and each other..if that made any sense. haha   Let's see..what all has happened intresting to me lately...well...things didnt work out with charlie, i'm a lil too shallow to go out with him, hes..umm..not my "type", so im back to block one, lonely and wanting a bf just so i can dress him and walk around showing a hot dude off...lol im so shallow i might as well drown in the kiddie pool haha. anyways, heres my newest seceret WHICH NO ONE KNOWS, but kaela, but she doesnt count...and of course unless ur in my drama 2nd period class, then i think u've caught on...but here it goes----  Over this past semester Catherine P. and i have become actually pretty decent friends, i mean, we've always been civil and nice to each other and said hey in the halls, but lately we talk a little more and are parterners on the soccer team and stuff like that. She tells me all her issues with her boyfriend Ben...and then again, Ben and i have become good friends this semester also...because hes in my 2nd period drama class, a class where i do nothing but sit, and sometimes lay on a couch with ben. *ouchies* well, Ben complains nonstop about how catherine never puts out for him (hahaha im laughin so hard now) and how he hates almost everything she says and does. In this class is also Chris, which is Falon's ex, and now is talking to Elizabeth M, and has been talkin to her for like EVER, and he flirts nonstop with Falon and its kinda funny, cuz they get the other couch. Chris tells me all about how Ben uses sunless tanner to get tan, and thats why his feet are white and his legs tan, and he tells me how catherine started giving ben head and stopped after a few short mins and ben got bad and went home without saying anything, and about how prom is coming up and again this year, both their dates have to be home when they got a cabin for after prom. Catherine cant go to the cabin without her mom being there and ben complains about how catherine always goes home to hang out with her mom and he hates it...im starting to think he hates everything about catherine. lol poor catherine. ANYWAYS, back to prom, ben, chris and i got into this convo about after prom things, like going to the cabin. Ben and i joked about how he could take catherine to prom but come and get me when he takes her home and i go to the cabin..haha it was a funny joke, but there was a twinkle in his eye. haha um..i was jk. anyways, that lead to a more in depth covno about what all me, ben, chris and falon could do at the cabin after prom, and that includes the comment made by ben "me and chris could train u two (pointing to me and falon)" train, as in.. a chugga chugga choo choo, as in ..we are all gonna be hooked together, as in..one tangled mess of bodies, one complicated orgy. *as i feel like a bad grandkid with my grandfather behind me working as i type all of this* it was funny though haha And then there was the time, well it was friday, we had to use to library as our drama room and ben and sat at a table and falon and chris sat with some other people. Falon threw me and ben 2 pieces of gum and ben took both grrr. he told me i had to earn my gum *rolls eyes* i had to play flick football with him. haha oh buddy. we played football for like 45mins and through out the game he tore off a piece of my gum and slid it across the table. When we were bored with that he started tryin to throw my script in the trash, pissed me off so i turned around and faced the other way and said i wasnt talking to him, he started to sing that "happy together" song or whatever and play with my hair, so i had to turn around and smile, i cant get pissed off at him, anyways, we went back to playin football and u have to like lean across the table to push the lil paper over the edge to get a touchdown, well..when u have ben looking down ur shirt...and then the time he flicked the football down my shirt...it gets more intresting. WELL, change of subject. LAURA GREENE. ugh. she goes up to falon and chris and says " ben and julia are gonna start to date cuz they flirt all the time and u and chris are gonna start to date cuz yall flirt all the time" GRR falon comes up to me and ben and tells us. I'm like...omg...what's ben gonna say or do? Ben looks at me and then looks at falon and just kinda laughs. im finally at ease..haha i was like omg what if he jumps up and goes UGH NO I HATE JULIA haha welll, we just laughed it off. He is dating catherine after all. lol anyways, heres more of the lil seceret, i like ben lol yes...i have grown to like ben. I liked it when laid his head on my arm and held my hand, i like it when he leans up against me and looks at me and i like it when we play the slap game (where u slap the other person forehead when they dont see it coming) and i like it when we joke about how we're gonna screw one day..haha and i really like it when hes pissed me off and he looks at me and puts his hand on my leg and starts to sing me these stupid old love songs. lol i even like it that he has a gf and shes a friend of mine HAHA ..naw it makes me feel bad that i flirt with her bf...lol i like ben..haha and yes, for wondering minds, i would go to the cabin with that boy after prom, ANYDAY haha but i would be good of course. :D   oh and one more thing, chris is hott too...even if ive had his gum in my mouth --might as well explain briefly...ok, he had this gum and wouldnt give me any and he kept handin me gum outta his mouth and i would never take it, then i said if u do it again ill take it, thinkin he didnt wanna lose his gum..well he took it outta his mouth and stuck it in my face..so i had to take it cuz he was like..u said u were gonna..so i did..i chewed his gum...lol hey hes hot, and i got gum...haha   so now u know who i like lauren and the scandalious things i do in drama 2....haha and now im gonna go take my inkblot test!

      today totally sucked ass...first thing in the morning, i get up early and cant fall back asleep...but i only have about 40mins left until i get up anyways, so i go get in the shower and my 2 brothers are pounding on the door wanting the "cool" kind of toothpaste and not the kind that "sucks". SORRY i didnt know that crest organge whitening toothpast was "cool" over the aquafresh. Next thing, my mom is like "julia why cant u ride the bus this morning with the boys instead of me taking you??" UMM MOM MAYBE I CANT BECAUSE A-MY KNEE HURTS AND B-UR TAKING ME oh well..who calls right before we walk out the door...JOHN, now its not that i dont like john, cuz i like him a lot, i just hate it when my mom isnt a "mom" because she spends her days and nites and dinners and EVERYTHING with that one man and HIS family that she forgets she has her oown damn family..ugh...well he calls and i answer and shes on the phone saying she needs to take me to school and if he would like a cup of coffee and how she'll see him at breakfast. OOH SO U WANT ME TO GET ON THE BUS AND HURT MY KNEE MORE SO U CAN GO HAVE BREAKFAST WITH JOHN? i started yelling at her and just going off because honestly, my feelings were hurt. She then gets all mad cuz im yelling at her for "having a life" and how my knee probably doesnt hurt, that im just making it up to make her do things for me, like take me to school. thats the biggest bunch of bullshit EVER. lol so we argue and then she says "u know i hope they drain your knee today at the doctor and u know what else julia? it hurts like hell and im not going to hold your hand! your going to sit there and be an adult" now...i have this major fear of needles. i cant control my body when i know im gonna get poked with a needle. My blood literally runs cold and i start to shake and then here comes the tears...not like sobbing, but like just tears rolling down my cheek. Ive tried many times to control it...cuz shots dont actually hurt, even i know that. But my mom didnt have to say that...they were gonna stick a HUGE ASS needle under my knee and suck out all the juice...and she even knew it hurt like shit and she still said "well im not gonna hold ur hand!" how childish...so she picks me up from school..with a chocolate milkshake...lmao we're in the office and i can tell she feels bad when she hears the dr. talkin about draining my knee outside in the hall, and i look at her, stick out my tounge and say "im not gonna hold ur hand!"...she looked kinda embrassed and gulity...good she needed to feel bad! lol  So..we're in the dr's office...and he comes in says "ive looked at ur MRIs and well...it's not so good." YAY what everyone loves to hear!!! heres what he says:"You have some pretty serious injuries, 3 to be exact. You have torn your ACL, you have compacted bones, and blood has filled your knee joint. Now, the compacted bones is where your bones (the 2 that make up ur knee) smack together causing them to bruise deeply. (he said i was lucky i just didnt break the joint) and the other injury is where the joint has filled up with blood." Now...buddy oh boy...what do u do to fix it? SURGRY!! what fun. the chick who is TERRIFIED of needles has to have an IV! and yes...the IV is the part im worried about, not the cutting or stitching or anything like that...dammit...but there is a good side to this story  I GET TO CHOSE WHEN I WANT MY SURGRY CUZ MY KNEE CANT GET ANY WORSE!!! haha that means after my hondorus trip! lol yay... oh but no more soccer....and i gotta have a special ACL brace fitted to my knee for when i play tennis...  Today at school we had this drunk driving assembly about 2 kids that died and 1 that barely survied. I cried my eyes out...i knew the kids, i had helped someone babysit them...it just tore my heart out. I dont think ive ever cried like that in school...the thing that made me even want to cry more was when i looked at Chris C. afterwards and his eyes were red and all watery...and i said (kinda joking...but i meant it seriously) "be careful after prom okie dokie" cuz we had just gotten done talkin about how much he was going to drink...and he looked at me and said "dont worry, im leaving my keys at home and ill be careful, i promise" and i was standing in front of him and he hugged me...just a nice snug lil hug...it almost made me cry...

      i think granite causes cancer. *go ahead and laugh* but like at my church, it's made of all granite, the people who live in the neighborhoods surrounding the church surprisingly all have cancer! and my neighbor before he moved into his house he had it tested for some kinda radiological thing, stuff that causes cancer. and his house had a very high dose of this stuff so he had to get this special fan put in so it circulates it..idk its confusing, but it hink granite causes cancer. its all in the soil...mt airy is all gonna die of cancer because of where we live. by the way, my mom suddenly has skin cancer spots on her arms...that's what made me make the connection and learning that granite has those radioloical whatevers. but usually its underground so it shouldnt effect it..but noo..the granite is out to get us!   *i had a whole blog written and well..i did something and it all disappeared..dammit...and come to find out...granite does cause cancer cuz it has RADON in it...and i guess now i wont become all rich and famous and marry some hot guy off of the O.C...dammit...*

      hmm...whats up with me? nuttin much...just listenin to some hot vegas...dammit, i wish i would just stop mentioning them even if i am listenin to them!! ok lets talk about...Limbeck. an AWESOME group, they actually played a show with hot vegas and limbeck has made it to the "public" u know, where most everyone knows who u are, like they have a music video for their first single called "julia" lol the guys of hot vegas (there i go again) were surprised i knew who limbeck was, but u know duh i know who they are, they have a song called julia, so umm yeah! lol   my mom gave me the funniest talk ive EVER heard in my WHOLE 16 years of walking this weird earth...and this is what happened:  Me:"omg mom look at those hot guys!!! (skaters skating on the steps at our church when we were driving by)" Mom: "ugh julia, u need to get better taste.." Me: "omg whatever!!! HOTTNESS!!! OMG!!" Mom:"are there any guys at school you would like to go out with, like to a movie or something?" Me:"no one at my school is worth going for and if they are they're taken..." Mom:"im just worried you dont know how to act around the opposite sex u know, i dont want you to be one of those girls who just gets a boyfriend because she'll have sex..." (refering to getting my chest signed by hot guys..aka- hot vegas)  Me:"umm i know how to act, i have guy friends..ive been out with guys...and im sorry but hot guys make u do weird things, and umm..yeah...and who cares what i do anyways, its not like ur doing them, i am, and if i want some HOT dude to write on me with an expo dry erase marker then i damn will please have him do it" Mom:"oh"  Me:"hahaha whatever"   HAHAHA SAYING IM ONE OF THOSE GIRLS WHO IS JUST GOING TO GET SOMEONE CUZ I PUT OUT?! HELLO UMM NO, i just like hot guys.   i do want a dude though...for real...haha i still kinda have a thing for the guy who does my nails, but i took my nails off so i dont go as offen *he talks to my MOM when she goes...* and i guess i would be all CRAZY for him if i talked to him more...but i dont talk to him a ton so u know how that goes...haha i do like looking at him when i go to the mall cuz hes HOT. he's really "pretty" though, not like gay pretty girly, but like "abercrombie" pretty. like muscles and tight shirts...and faded jeans...lol okay hes freakin hot, but right this second i want a skater! haha i always go back and forth..just no rednecks or cowboys please...*barf*  i was thinking about something...im really gonna miss lauren if (and i hope she does) go to NCSSM...i just started thinkin about everything like...idk...life, she i started thinkin about her, and omg im gonna miss the hell outta that girl, but hey, im looking forward to weekends and stuff where we can go wild and ill be driving and hot guys...(that are smart, always a plus) and stuff like that!! lol im excited for her totally, but the closer it gets to the end of the year, 5 weeks, the more i realize how much im going to miss her. i love u lauren!  i hate mrs diamont...especially at times when she moves lauren away from me while we watch a band..thingie..u know 4 mexicans get up and shake their hips and play their guitars...mirachi or whatever. i hate laura greene for telling on lauren too. bitches.  awesome new quote (and yes..here i go again) : "lose all your inhabitions and come get down with me" --"By the Pool", Hot Vegas   i think andrew palmer (the vocalist/song/music writter/guitar) is very talented. his talent is unlike any other i've seen...his songs, theres something about them i really like. when i listen to the lyrics its like.."dude...what is going through his mind?" lol i mean, in "By the Pool" i dont think it even mentions a pool!!! haha hello?!what are u thinking? lol maybe he wrote it by the pool... hmm..and the song called "Many Thanks" it goes like "your so beautiful so perfect im never gonna let you go" something along those lines and no where in the song does it have anything to do with "many thanks" ...weird...haha but my point is that, he writes these songs that have actual meaning, meaning to him, at least i think thats right...who knows, but ive always wanted the talent to write music...and i respect him for his talent, oh and i wanna bang him. lmao   i want to write a book...what kinda book? idk yet...just a book...maybe a book about my life? naw...too unorginal...a book about hot guys...no, too "stupid" ...i want a book that shows thought and meaning that im proud of. i know!! a book of random wonders. stuff i think about, stuff i wonder about...my theories and philosphies. wow..thats deep. but im gonna do it! im gonna write a real book..called...(subject to change) "Self-Portrait".  *much love*

I LOVE U!! lol ok good mood right now. im tired of the same bs day after day. the fake friendships (catherine and sometimes katie and gitt..and u know the usual) and the fake smiles and hellos. im tired of putting up with cat's comments on how im just being nice and friends with "more popular kids just so i can social climb" i think i can be friends with whoever i damn well please catherine. if falon runs up to me and says hey and i say hey back, back off and dont call me a social climber. ugh. just cuz she isnt nice to u doesnt mean she cant be nice to be and just because u put her up on some throne and say "ooo shes so popular" then thats ur problem there. ugh.

      LALALALALA ok finally i get to update my blog, i would have sooner, but i guess i just didnt really think about it. ben and catherine broke up, my reaction "yay no more gulity feelings" but u know what, ive noticed them together since the "breakup" and cat says they are together and never broke up, ben told me they broke up and are still broken up but just "friends" wow..what a weird story. andrew and katie broke up and inside im like "yes, finally, katie might wake up and be a normal person for once in her life!" but then again, this prob. means i'll see less and less of andrew, but u know ive gotten used to it over the last year because i never see him without katie and everyone knows they just do things by themselves and with none of their other friends. ugh.   im tired of catherine (laurens cousin, not ben's ex/gf/whatever they are). she puts everyone down around her and holds herself above everyone else. grrr. i actually spend too much of my free time talking shit about her, i think thats unhealthy, but u know, i eat junk food and its unhealthy, so unhealthyness rock on.   i want to learn how to play the guitar. i just need a guitar...  im getting really excited about going to see my brother in hondoras. REALLY EXCITED! i cant wait. i'm gonna be sooo happy to see my older brother, because jack and i have this bond that i dont have with anyone else. we never really get into fights, we can have serious intellgent conversations and joke around. i miss the times when he would come home from wake forest and sit with me in the basment. he would bring up the topic of his latest gf and he would ask me questions about what he should do or say or think about something she had done. jack was always living away from home since he was like 13, so we didnt get to "grow up" together, even though he is my brother. i pretended not to enjoy it, but i loved having those chats in the basement with him. *..feeling the tears coming on* it was like words werent needed between us, we could just be in the same room. then he goes and moves to hondoras and i dont see him for a year..fun stuff. im excited about seeing him for a whole month or month and a half and then im excited about leaving the country, leaving my friends behind and going by myself. i change the most when im not around everyday people. lol dude i'd give anything to come back all nice and tan and looking totallly different, hello-nasty ass hond. food, i may come back 50lbs lighter. lmao  i have this new crush...hehe he does my nails! haha hes hot. oh and i broke a nail the other day when i fell UP the stairs..but if he asks how i did it while he fixes my broken nail, i broke it during a soccer game. :D   SPEAKIN OF SOCCER something pissed me off last nite. we had a soccer game against south stokes. the other nite we also had a soccer game at east wilkes. well there are these 2 girls on the team that are sisters, pang and mia. ugh. they both play the same postion as me. well, i hate to say it, but they both suck at soccer. mia's problem is she doesnt really understand what to do..she looks lost out there. pang's problem is she think she has to be right beside of her sister mia...ugh, pang does not stay in her postion!! she stands right beside mia. grr well coach usually puts them in together because they play better that way (i dont think so) and since there are 2 of them and 3 forwards on the field, she puts those 2 in and the captain. so that leaves me on the bench. well lately shes been putting me in before them and the 2 captains. yay. i was all happy, but last nite she competely forgot about me, i didnt play any in the damn game. grrrr and its because pang and mia were in and then jenna. GRRRRR pang passed the ball to the other team 4 times, stood across the field from where she was supposed to be (beside mia, pang plays left, mia plays right) and totally missed a shot on goal. dammit. oh well, i didnt say anything but ive started to hate hmongs more and more. lmao not really...but i hate them.

      okay, so i'm now with my daddy in TN!!! yay! lol heres what all i've done so far. After leaving good old mount airy, we drove to Piegon Forge and Gatlinberg, TN which is this tourist area, it's cool though, i gotta admitt. Dad and i rode this sky lift, which is just bascially a ski lift up and down the mountain. that was a lot of fun. Then we went and i got homemade chocolate covered cherries!! OMG my fave!!! haha and we went to the Rippley's aquirum. You get to go through this underwater tunnel and look at all the sharks and fish and stuff. I played with a King Crab haha i got crabs!! and pet a sting ray. lol very intresting. We stayed in this hotel, which was really nice, hot tubs...yay!! but i didnt get in. I was too tired. haha This morning before leaving that town we went to a mall and i bought stuff at Tommy Hilfigure, Gap, Fossil and Old Navy. I got the cutest shoes at old navy!! haha thats all i got there. At Tommy i got this pink shirt and the coolest pink skirt i have EVER seen. At Fossil i got the coolest PINK watch ever!! it was the best $70 spent i think. At Gap i got some capris that are cute. We then ate and headed back the 4hrs to my dads house. We've been all over town, looking at the local univeristy and stuff like that. Tommorrow we're going to go see The Day After Tomorrow and sometime we're gonna go see Shrek 2. lol Theres lots to do here but i miss being back home with all my friends. My mom actually made me cry when i was leaving, i got in the car as i we started to back out of the drive way she mouthed "i love you" that brought tears to my eyes but i sucked it up. I also cried when i walked into my dads house and he had every picture, every card, everything i had ever made him all on his fridge and around his house. He's really excited him here. I never knew he held on to so much. Mine and the boys pictures are everywhere. Gotta love him.   aaron just informed me he wanted to get freaky in my jeep...i was telling him how i want a yellow jeep wrangler. haha ok aaron, whatever darlin. I told him he was "aaron ur so goofy" and he said "what if im not trying to be goofy..." whoa now, im scared!! haha stop laughing lauren, my luck, you prob arent...haha ok. so start laughing!! now stop!! i bet you didnt laugh that time either...i love u!!! haha

Trevor took 15mins..usually he takes the whole damn day. i was proud. haha I then took my Spanish 2 exam and i made a 95 on it..now, this is the same class i had a 57 in and then with many smiles and nice words pulled it up to a 98...but pani thinking that its not far, it got pulled back down to a 91...oh well, i made a 95 on the exam! haha YAY! even though my overall for the class will be an 80 because of the past grades..u know those 72's...haha   My knee surgry is now going to be on Aug. 2nd. yay. before school starts, that gives me about a little over a week i think to recover and get off those stupid ass crutches, im not doing crutches again at school...if i have to, it will be the 3rd time ive had to use them at school in the last 4 years. no way. lol no more please!! especially with all those damn stairs, at least the middle school didnt have stairs.   After my exams i went to my mom's school to sit in on her last art class of the day. It was a 5th grade class and they were doing self-portraits. My mom handed me a paper called the "Big Head", which is a paper with this rather large head pre-drawn for you. You find the marks where to put your eyes, mouth, nose, ears, ect. I was made to do one. As i did mine i was thinking "wow this looks pretty good..." haha It was actually a lovely picture, seeing the source haha i cant draw. I laid down my pencil and crayons and looked at my masterpiece but only to see how depressed it looked. It really got to me. I swear if i was in my room drawing that i would have started crying. It looked so damn depressd! "I" wasnt even smiling! Well, because i couldnt master the smiling lips very well..haha i told my mom "I" looked depressed so she put some lines under my eyes to "change the expression" whatever, i still looked at "me" and saw a depressed face. Then again, i am leaving all summer and i'm going to be without my friends...maybe i am somewhat distressed. not depressed...but i dont know..saddened maybe. Oh and i almost hit the mailman when i was driving...haha   It's a beautiful day!!! People are going to grad. tomorrow night and then to see the movie The Day After Tomorrow. Part of me wants to go since i will be leaving saturday, but then part of me doesnt. I dont know why i dont want to go...i mean, come on now julia, you'll be leaving and now heres a chance to go see a movie you WANT to see and CANT wait to see with your FRIENDS...i dont know how to explain that one. Maybe i dont want to go to grad. Part of me does...but the other part doesnt really wanna sit there and watch people go away. Maybe im just being a stupid bitch stick in the mud. haha I'll prob go anyways...make myself go, knowing i'll regret it if i dont...but i'll have to totally haul ass to pack and clean my room, because if my room isnt clean by the time i leave my mom is going to clean it. That means she'll read every note and evey paper under my bed. I dont know if i really want that. haha no telling what i've hidden in my room i have forgotten about...  THE SUN WOKE THE WHOLE STATE by LIMBECK  Thanks for the ride to the airport.  My head got stuck out the window.  And it felt so good cause I’ve never had that kind of luck on the way home.  When I got out, you were there knockin’ on the front door.  The cold gets in the things you wear.  It’s so good it’s that time again.   Thanks for stopping by the river so I could run to take it.  Of all these days we wake, here is one to remember: the first day of October.   It don’t mean much.  We never had a chance.  We’re out of touch.  The space between us spells it out.  I like that song, im actually listening to it. I was listening to old burned cds i made back when i first got a cd burner (oooo ahhhh hahaha) and i found a song called Tennessee. Heres some bits and pieces. It's by Marcel, hes an "ok" new singer. hes a pop/country mix.   It's a Sunday morning, lying awake, It's just another lonely day, I lie in bed and wonder, How long it's gonna take Then I think to myself, Will I ever get a break, Did I make a big mistake, If you need me, burn it up, Bend the rules leave right away, If you need me take a four lane, Headed my way, Take a bus, take a plane, Take a car, take a train, Take a bike, hitch a ride, you decide, If you need me you know where I'll be, In Tennessee  Kinda a stupid cheesy song...but it reminded me of leaving, and im going to TN..how weird. hahaha    It's not always rainbows and butterflies...

      okay...last few days have been very exciting/stressful/happy/sad/mad/frantic/and anything else you can use to describe anything that is bittersweet. kinda like those chocolate chips at laurens house, chocolate dykes is what i let slip outta my mouth..haha but bittersweet...u know like they're so good, i usually dont sit around eating chocolate chips, but i suddenly had the urge to, they are good but at the same time they are going to ur thighs and ass. bittersweet.   Well i went to laurens house as i have already written in the blog before and we didnt get to go on our little "hike" but we sat around smoking cigs. haha we felt so badassed. It was a great moment. Catherines response..."omg how could you guys?!" and 10mins later "omg i wanna get drunk with you guys!" um hell no.   I read a poem in the school's new literary magaizine today about love. I thought it was 100% correcto. It's by a girl who was on the soccer team with me, Chasity. She isnt someone i would usually hang out with, but that girl wrote a poem that i really liked. It was about how if you love someone, you should tell them. If you dont u may regret it, if you do u'll never regret it. I've thought that for years. A line in it said something about yelling and fighting but still loving. It made me think of aaron. Ive thought a lot about aaron lately, maybe because i feel close to him now, and i never really did. Yeah, that's it..i feel close to him. Hes not much on the outside, but inside we really click. I'm glad we've both grown up and accepted each other for what the other is worth. He gives good hugs too...it's like his hugs arent fake, they're real. i like that. But aaron and i just sit around and talk about immature stuff. we mainly talk about sex. wow..surprised? nope.   Ben and Chris are leaving me. I want to go to their grad. friday but part of me doesnt. I know i wont be able to walk up to them and give them a hug and be like CONGRATS!!! *hug kiss hug kiss* because of everyone else around them and their family. I'm actually happy i have to paint as my exam with them this friday for drama. Ben pinched the hell outta my ass today. it hurt! haha i yelled ouch and he laughed and then hugged me, blaming me and chris for loosing his yearbook i never had. ummm...sounds like chris lost it ben. go ask him and stop fussing at me. dammit. i'm gonna miss them a lot.   I went to the dr. today during 2nd period and we supposedly set the date for my knee surgry, my grandfather took me, so i planned the surgry with the doc. I set it for july 7 with pre-op july 6. That is when he told me it would be the best time, because hes going on vacation during the last 2 weeks in july and didnt want to do any surgries the week before he left. i can understand that. So i was like yay i'll have my knee worked on, stay in bed for a week, and still have time to spend with my friends. i came home and told mom i had set it up...she of course said NO JULIA im changing it. ugh why mom oh why?! wanna know why? i found out im literally spending the whole damn summer with my dad. not just a month like i planned. fuck dammit fucmmit. WHY?! the dr. had told me he wanted to do it in july because if he had to do it in aug. it would be the same week school starts...mom said thats fine, i'll just miss the first damn week of school. thats gonna suck. that means im already doomed to take all my fuckin exams next year. FUCK. well maybe not all...but 1st semester is for sure. fuck. i dont want to go fight those stairs with cruthes and shit during school. oh well...i cried and cried, for like 2 hours. I just laid there on my bed with my head in my pillow letting it all out. i thought about calling lauren and crying but knew she was with hollis, so didnt bother. i will later though. i cried because i was going to miss the 1st week of school, that a lot happens that first week. maybe i should be happy i get to miss a week...but you know, that i means i gotta fight with crutches and stuff...i cried about that. I cried that i wouldnt get to see my friends over the summer. i cried telling my mom lauren was going away and i wanted to spend time with her. my mom said "well laurens not my child" and i said "i wish i wasnt ur child" through my sobs. Its gonna make me cry just writting about it. ...ok im offically crying now. i cant believe this. all summer with the people who keep me going, who keep me who i am. i'd go insane without them. i would have already moved to live with my dad if it wasnt for them. they dont know that, but its true. I love them with all my heart. they are my life. I can hardly go to the bathroom by myself, how will i spend a whole summer by myself?...i dont know. I guess when im laying in my bed during the first week or so of school lauren will still be in town, and she can come hang out with me and we can spend days together watching tv and me sneeking her pain pills. haha nice thought huh lauren?   Now that i have to accept the fact i wont be home all summer ( im coming back the first of aug.) i have to make something positive out of it. maybe i'll come back totally different. i hope so. Randy told me today i looked like a healthy ashley oslen. haha yea ok, thanks randy, but the lighting must have been pretty damn good. even though it made me feel good.   Oh well...let the good times roll... all that is rolling right now is tears and they dont make good times. i hate life sometimes. dammit.

      boy oh boy...ive had quite a week give or take a few days, well, since i last posted. haha there. I'm not going yo hondorus. dammit, i dont gete to drink and party with a bunch of spanish speaking people who have no idea what the word "awesome" is. dammit. hahaha that was random, anyways, im going to go stay with my dad. staying with my dad has its pros and cons, which are listed below for your reading pleasure.   PRO: SWIMMING POOL IN THE BACKYARD TO MY SELF CON: If i get really sunburned, then i get sick haha PRO: WORKIN ON THA TAN CON: skin cancer PRO: MY DADDY TAKING ME SHOPPING :D CON: gaining 10lbs, or losing 10lbs and not being able to wear it all haha PRO: GOING ON AN ANNUAL SUMMER DIET AND THEN COMING BACK TO SEE MY FRIENDS CON: having to wait over a month to see my friends or lose some pounds! haha PRO: JUST BEING WITH MY DAD FOR MORE THAN 24HRS LITERALLY CON: having to see all the things that used to be in my house growing up, bring back memories. it took me a while to get over that, like 5yrs lol long ass story.  PRO:GETTING TO DO COOL NEW EXCITING STUFF, LIKE CONCERTS HOPEFULLY! CON: ummm...i dont know....haha getting raped? naw..hahah PRO: GETTING TO SEE FAMILY I HAVENT SEEN SINCE I WAS 7 CON: being forced on them, i know they dont want anything to do with me, but it means a lot of my dad for them to "accept" me..fuck them all. they havent talked to me since i was 7, im now 16. PRO: MY AUNTS ARE LOADED WITH BOATS AND LAKES AND STUFF... CON: who gives a fuck. i dont wanna be on their shit. hahah  now...the biggest CON of all time? not being able to see lauren before she goes off to school as much as i wanted to. I wanted to spend ALL the time i could, because i hate to say it though, shes my only real friend at our school...which sucks. i could live a good 2 months without katie and everyone else, i could talk to them through emails and be fine with only seeing them 3 times a year, but lauren, gosh, i tell her like everything (yeah u) haha and i just like being around her. dammit, it sounds like im in love with her haha naw, shes just a really awesome friend. which reminds me...  Allie moore, amy deborde, and amanda bruner, and clarise strange are like lesbos. HAHA allie made out with amy at jalisa's house like all weekend and then went and got a hotel room with clarise and then i heard amanda was in on with with allie sometime. who did i hear it from? a very VERY disgusted amdanda williams at the good ol' mayberry mall. hahaha i believe her, she was like seriously distrubed. LMAO and i saw allie and amy at lunch...the look on their faces when their eyes met...awww..LMAO  Theres so much to complain about and to say but u know...im not in the mood! haha im happy  CHRIS C. IS SO FREAKIN HOT! and to think that when i put together all the body parts of his ive seen, ive seen him totally naked!! haha how funny is that? very.   I want a guy...bad....lol and to think theres not any hot guys that live around my dads...that i know of...hmmm im getting ideas.   ANOTHER PRO: i'll have the computer ALL day to myself from 7am-6pm! haha yay so i can talk to all my friends who arent doing anything at all! haha see lauren, it wont be so bad.   VOTE JULIA STUDENT BODY TREASURER!   *much love*

      omg..like im so confused now that blogger has changed...haha maybe i should explore and find new cool stuff to do with it!!..maybe not...haha probably will when i have more time, but im suppose to be translating this long ass spanish story into english, luckly i read laurens blog for www.freetranslation.com girl, ur right, it does kick ass! haha anyways, catherine and i are teaching spanish class tomorrow, i have to teach with 1. a girl i hate and 2. last week my average was a 57...now its going to be a 96...the educational system is just wacked!! haha but im not complaining. All you gotta do is be liked by the teachers. haha fun stuff! Oh and 2. did i mention how much i hate catherine? now sometimes i feel bad that all i rant and rave about is one of my best friends cousins. I wonder sometimes if she is ever like "aww my poor cousin, i wish people were nice to her" but then again, shes mean to her...hmm...i dount lauren is like "aww my poor cousin.." because if she was she would stand up for her, thats just how lauren is. :D  Katie is soooo freakin ...idk...STUPID?! i mean, ugh. shes getting on my last nerve, and believe me, my first nerve wasnt pretty either. haha ive always wondered why people say last nerve, what was the fist one like?  Right now i wish i was back at school to watch lauren sing but i had to do my spanish. sucks. oh well, i know she did awesome.   Leslie East came up to me and catherine and was like "so are you going to be the only mat-maid next year?" and since no one else has shown intrest and all the others were seniors i am the only one. I WANT TO BE THE ONLY ONE. lol its fun being the only one. WELL...catherine says "I'LL BE A MAT-MAID WITH U!" and i was like, *think fast think fast make her hate it* so i said, "well its during swimming and it takes up all my saturdays and 3 afternoons out of the week." and she said "well i'll be there every saturday" and im thinkin "damn damn damn nazi bitch* (nazi sounded cool there) and then it hit me!!! we're all eating and all the sudden i say "OOH CATHERINE!! im glad you want to be a mat-maid with me!! because the 1st years have to clean up the blood and puke!! yay and im head matmaid so i dont have to!" Catherine flat out said she wasnt going to do it. I kept insisting she do it, that its really fun and you get to hang out with hot guys on a bus for hours and really get to know them ;) haha and well thank god she stuck to her "no" answer. Im so smart! :D ...but u do really have to clean up blood and puke, even though i never had to, candiace, last years head mat maid did...but hell im not...coach bodnar can :D haha   Thank you god for my wonderful deciving brain :D - amen.

He was with some little boy named Brad and they went to Katilin Johnsons (keyans house) house to "play basketball", yea them at 7 little girls. SOOO...yeah Brads mom came by my house to drop off something he forgot she stuck around until 1am and they called the cops, 5 cops, an ambulance, the rescue squad and dogs were outside my house along with my grandparents and neighbor....haha and i missed it all. Meanwhile i was at a rodeo with kaela watching her brother "dogshoot" lol (wrestling a steer).   Its a really pretty day!! lol yay im gonna go lay out in the nice warm sun. haha   My dad comes out this weekend! lol im all excited about that one.

      blah blah blah!! life is good at the moment!! lol wooo whooo!! heres whats new:  Katie was TOTALLY talking trash about everyone in spanish today to danielle montely. She was telling her all about her and andrew and she hardly even tells me that stuff, probably cuz half of the shit she says is made up in her little head. She then said lauren (yeah u) was pissed off at her for going after Will. Now...lets see...if i was lauren i would be pissed cuz lauren had this major crush on will..but then again, will was an ass to lauren, and the last thing i would want is my friend going after an ex-major-crush/asshole. lol thats confusing, but im sure lauren understands. and maybe lauren doesnt even care, but what gives katie the right to tell danielle (ugh i hate her) that lauren is pissed and make it sound like lauren is the bad guy?! lol oh well...katie told me she saw a hot guy working at lowes foods and how she knocked over a display and he helped her pick it up and they "flirted" and she went on to tell me how shes going to make will take her to lowes so she can flirt with the lowes boy in front of willbo...how...WEIRD. Katie needs a life.   I had the coolest dream ever: Lauren was off at NCSSM and called me up and begged me to come spend the weekend with her. So i packed a bag, grabbed my purse and drove out to see her. When i got there we hung out and she showed me around and let me meet all her friends. What happened next...is whoa. haha She introduces me to this HOT GUY i mean...hes like kinda punkish...kinda artsy. HE WAS HOT. and well...lauren was totally dating his TWIN bro (how weird) but we all got drunk and lauren and i got laid. HAHAHA ok...how missed up is THAT?! haha it was a good dream though ;)   Today me, ben, and chris were sitting around talkin and ben was telling me once more how his 18th bday is sunday and i was like..yeah yea yea i know. he then asked me if i was getting him a bday present and i just smiled and gave him this look like "of course...but u know its nothing u can buy..." haha a perverted kinda twist to a bday, just being goofy of course. He then told me about this cd he wanted and i pretended to be intrested and he said...no i dont want that cd from you...i want head. and that got my attention so i said "what?!" and he said...yeah, i want you to gimme head for my bday! haha and i said..oh ok ben, sure. and he was like OMG ARE YOU SERIOUS?! and of course i had to get my kicks so i said "yeah.." haha he then grabbed my arm and started pushing me between his legs and i laughed and said not here ben! and he just looked at me and said "ammatures" haha whatever. well, hes right. haha but so what. Would i give ben head...idk but hes cute...haha LMAO shhhh   Today katie and i were talkin about what all we had done as far as drinking and smoking, ect. Well we both have smoked and gotten a little tipsy and catherine wood overhead and about DIED. she said she had no idea our grade was so "corrupt" omg...lol hello. she said she wasnt sheltered but had no idea people in our "clique" OMG WHAT CLIQUE-SHES NOT IN IT were like that. umm...catherine we'd all have to be drunk to hang out with you dear. Thinkin about getting drunk, this weekend this freshman Allyson, i was on the soccer team with her, invited me to spend the night with her at her dads with these like 18-20yr old guys and get totally smashed. I said...."sure" haha i know its stupid, but all reality, i really dount we'll keep our plans and you know i wont be stupid...lol but when oppurtunies come around you gotta take them. :D haha hopefully i wont wake up with some weird freak by me...haha im just kiddin. im not stupid and we prob wont even get together. I wish i could talk roberta into getting me and lauren some stuff!! haha i know ur laughin.   Speaking of katie and drinking.... Katie: heyyyyyyy J-SnizzleFizzle: hey buddy Katie: hola tequilaaaaaa Katie: lol Katie: i love ur name J-SnizzleFizzle: hahahahaha J-SnizzleFizzle:  thats me! Katie: thats me Katie: lol J-SnizzleFizzle: lol J-SnizzleFizzle: so whats new?

      I WROTE THIS DOWN....LIMBECK  We were supposed to have a black and white spring, do you remember that? You’re probably packing some things to bring. Toss the boxes in the back.   I wrote this down for you.  Not because you’re leaving, just because we like you.  Yeah, just because we like you.   That was the last great thing I ever had.  Hope you remember that.   Who’s going to be around with me?   We wrote this down for you.  Not because you’re leaving, just because we like you.   And if my fingers should start to crack or blister, I guess that’s just what happens.  Don’t forget the things you’re leaving.  i love limbeck!!! rock on limbeck!!! they played a show with hot vegas...haha just thought i'd add that in there. Check them out at www.limbeck.net or hear their whole cd at www.hieverythingsgreat.com they even have a song called JULIA, awesomeness!!! The Beatles, Limbeck and FeFe Dobson all have songs called JULIA....wow....im cool.

      yay..its...MONDAY! i hate mondays. just so that is known.  Today katie didnt show up for 1st period and i have to admit i was glad. I decided i was going to sit by andrew in 4th period to get the scoop, so come 4th period i put my stuff in katies seat but here comes katie so i had to move. oh well. She totally showed how immature and phsyco she really honestly is. she made this list of questions for andrew to answer like "do you still love me?" "were you happy when we dated?" and "Is there someone else who would make you happier?" just a bunch of lame bullshit. And andrew at one point kinda got all frustrated and made like "STOP GO AWAY IM DONE!" hand gestures..like throwing his hands in front of him...i dunno its hard to describe with words. haha but it wasnt good. I heard from Lizzie that she kept saying over and over "andrew it's now or never" like 6 times during lunch, she even had the nerve to sit by him. So in spanish i was like...katie, how do you go "OMG OMG WILL WILL!!" to "i love andrew" i said it where andrew could hear. she said "i didnt go OMG OMG WILL WILL!!" and shot me a look. i just smiled. :D kinda like that...haha I asked her why she wasnt in 1st-3rd period and she said "because i just needed to catch up on sleep..." like she lost sleep over her and andrews breakup. WHATEVER. If she lost sleep over anything it was her thinking up some plan to get more attention. Today i asked her how to say Pathetic in spainsh, because i wanted to call her that. And she said "Andres" (andrews name in spanish...duh) shes so stupid at times and to think im left with her for the next 2 remaining years of my high school education. I wont have lauren to make seceret plans with...:( lol and i feel  like a "mean girl" talking shit about katie behind her back, even if its all true, and then having to go be buddy buddy "aww katie its ok...it'll all work out..." to her face. Oh well, i do it to catherine HAHA but i like katie more than her. Sometimes im glad that people have turned their backs and decided they dont like katie as much as they used to. everyone used to just hang around or go places because of katie. Lauren and i were kinda left to ourselves. Now, people are going with us, and giving the eye when katie is told about plans. haha thats what u get bitch. hahaha ok...that just sounded good to put right there.   Today in drama ben came up to me and felt my boobies...haha and asked if i was going to his 18th bday party at a "tittie bar" in winston. I just laughed. He then told me that he was gonna open up his own tittie bar and i could be his feature presentation, but he gets to have sex with his f.p. and if that was ok with me. I just laughed and said sure ben, i'll have sex with you. haha Him and chris kept doing the head smack game and i could never get them back. Ben finally sat down by himself and i walked up and landed the best smack EVER in the history of the game on him. he got pissed off. UGH i mean, he was only hitting me forever and never got hit ONCE until then. I was like WTF?! cuz he was like steaming mad. And he said "we were flirting earlier, you cant hit me when we're not flirting" i didnt know what to say. I mean, yea i liked ben, and i still kinda have a crush on him, but not a major-think-about-you-all-the-time-crush. I didn't know what to say...i mean he just admitted to flirting...lmao i didnt say anything, i just walked away and felt like an idiot.   Now, another crush, the guy that does my nails...lol i know his best friend. He doesnt know that though and his best friend just found out that i knew him. Saturday night i was talking to michael (the best friend) and he was like, "want me to come get you and we can go to my friends house" and i said.."ohh whats ur friends name?" and he said "minh" ...my crush...haha So i said.."well im babysitting, sorry" OMG wouldnt it be fun to show up to minhs house with michael?! haha i would LOVE it! All michael wants to do is get drunk and screw...but hes hot...haha not that i would get drunk and screw, im just stating that he is hot, him and his friend...haha 3 some! JUST KIDDING oh and i think minh added me to his messanger...i hope its him at least...i dont know though, he doesnt have much of a profile, but the name sounds like something he would have...lol telling from the little bit i know of minh. haha maybe im just wishing...which i am.   My biggest worry right now is if im going to Hondorus or not. I REALLY WANNA GO. and i can, even with my knee and all, because the dr said it was ok. but thats not my worry...this is: My mom and john were talking about going. John already has gone and gotten his passport and his shots. hes done just as much as i have right now for the trip. Him and mom want to go down to Hondorus during my last week there, stay for about a week and then maybe come home with me or a week before me, just depending on the week they chose to go. Today mom said "u need to ask your dad for ticket money" HOLD UP. she told me she would take care of the tickets, my dad has already paid for my passport and hes buying all my clothes and stuff i need down there and giving me spending money. knowing my dad, he'll say "your mom needs to do something". now im afraid my mom will be like "oh well...too bad, you cant go unless he gives you ticket money" or that she'll say "oh you cant go becase of your knee" and her and john will take off and go on the trip ive been waiting 2 years for. Why do i think this? because i know she wont pay for me to go to Hondorus and her. Shes already been...i havent...i know it sounds low, but i bet you a million bucks i dont get to go. another factor that plays into it? shes been online looking for HER AND JOHN tickets but hasnt even looked for me. Im sorry, i know shes my mom and i know its almost mothers day (and her bday) but my mom is a total fucking bitch somtimes.

      i went to the movies last nite with Zack, Hollis, And Lauren (you..but i bet u already knew ur name haha). IT WAS SOOO MUCH FUN!!! i wish hollis and zack didnt have to take the SAT today so we could have spent more time out. Not getting home at like 10:30ish-11 at nite is like..idk a good feeling when u walk in the door and i mean, you could have stayed out longer..maybe its just that the option is there. haha i have no clue  Katie is telling me how much she misses andrew and i tell her to back off and stop the crying and to end the knitting of a red scarf for him...how sad. I tell her that she needs to think of his feelings and how he cares about her and i dont think he wants to constantly be reminded of how much he hurt her...cuz i mean, andrew just doesnt hurt people like that...but he had to end things. (sounds like a good commerical for a soap opra..or the back of a love novel...)  MEAN GIRLS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE!! haha it made me want to be mean lol but then again nice to people at the same time. actually, i loved the mean ideas it had in it...like the burn book *evil laugh* haha  *much love* ...and i just thought of how lauren is going away...and how much im going to miss her...and how her last month in mt airy i'll be having surgry...but i'll be sure to recover for her FAST! and how..now in whats left of our "group" katie and i will be the only girls...but then theres now hollis and others...i guess....but i dont want to constantly diss on katie but turn around and she be the only one i have...at least in mt airy.

I didnt really do anything exciting and i forgot all about my lil job i do, packing those pics in those plastic baggie things. dammit, i have 300 to do and i've done 5..the other day. lol Theres no will power to make money anymore. i mean, i know that sounds CRAZY and i love money yes i do, but i just dont want to do it! lol I found these cute lil pink guages at Hot Topic, they're adorable but they're size 16..thats kinda like a regular earring, but the last guages i had were a 14. so i kinda want pink 14s. I didnt even ask if they had them a size bigger, so i'll prob go back later when i have more time and look. i havent spend a time of any of the money ive made so far this summer and its killing me. like, as soon as i think im gonna spend some of the money i change my mind..what the hell is wrong with me? i have no fuckin clue. lol   I saw madison today at his work. i thought he'd be off of work but he was working late. hes such a hot dork. u wanna know what he was wearing? he was wearing these lite blue faded TIGHT ass jeans,(lauern think josh's jeans from hot vegas...)and he had on black and white converse sneakers and an orange shirt and to top it all off..a bright green rugrats watch. lol hes such an...errr...unique person. lol hes adorable!   Yup...nothing else is going on. lol I did buy some new black shoes to wear with my skirts and stuff, they're for the wedding in 2 weeks where i will see almost my whole family on my dad's side. as in my cousins who are my age and stuff...yay. Well back to the shoes. they are black with like 5 inch super tall heels no lie. lol its almost hard to walk in them. but they are soo cute. lol they are shiny black. i also got some anklets (silver) one is just a silver one with a lil dressy charm on it. and the other is stars and lil diamond lookin things. they're both cute. buy one get one free from claires. haha Im tryin to imagine how my family will react to my outfit for the wedding...i doubt my mom would never let me wear what im going to wear to a wedding HAHA. its the black shirt with the pink dots and a lil black shirt with a cardigan (pink). its a cute outfit but it reminds me of something a punk chick would wear when she has to dress up. lol oh well, rock on.   *much love and rugrat watches*

      I just read Laurens blog and it was very entertaining. lol #1..omg why didnt u say hey to jason (..maybe the hottness got to ur head) when he was standing outside ur house?! lol obviously he wanted to see or..or better yet make out with u. haha and hes hot..so why not? it doesnt gotta mean anything. lol #2..awww the stuff about lucus. that's sweet, and yeah that montreat chick from LAST year is wasting her time and NEEDS help. im sure her insurence would cover it..she obviously can't help it if shes that crazy. #3..does lucus not know how to block people? lol dumbass.   I also just got in from nashville and lebanon. I went to church with dad as always and we had communion. Wow..ive never taken communion from a church like that, but u know communion is communion and as long as it symbolizes the same thing it doesnt matter where i take it. It was different. The scripture they use in that church..i dont like it. Something was said today in the communion readings about how jesus died and then was "banished to hell and on the 3rd day he rose to heaven" WELL...ive never heard about jesus going to hell...lol i thought he was perfect and duh..hes gods soon! and if hell is supposed to be feared, why would god send his son? jesus christ, where did people get that idea that he went to hell?! If jesus went to hell, then i guess EVERYONE in the world is going to hell. So, i asked my dad in the car why they said jesus went to hell when i believe he didnt and ive never heard that part of the story. he was like..oh i didnt even notice..umm duh, its YOUR church, YOU should KNOW what they believe. dammit. i didnt like it. lol oh and another thing...i have found a new oxymoron "penicostal hymn". hymns are works or art, beautiful songs, meant to be played by an organ. penicostal hyms are loud and weird and with drums. oxymoron. now, i will admitt, im being a lil closedminded..yes i realize that. but im hardly never like this about something...but as long as people go to church right? its their right and freedom. but..i still dont like. lol i'll be glad to be back at my church.   Dad and i went to Cracker Barrel for lunch after church and i was walkin around the little store and omg..i saw something sooo cute so i went over to look at it. It was a toddlers toy,you know those "no hard plastic" toys that are u know..plush. lol  but it was a jeep wrangler and it had 2 little dolls, a boy and a girl and a dog. The boy was wearing jeans and a yellow shirt and a hat to the side, the girl had blonde hair and was dressed in all pink. They ride around with the dog in the back seat and them in the front. I picked it up to look closer at it and i was lookin at the lil boy and i noticed on his yellow shirt was written DANNY. just like that. wow..freaked the hell outta me. a toy jeep wrangler with a dude named danny in it and a blonde chick dressed in all pink...lol. i was gonna buy it but it was $15..and decided to buy a shirt at american eagle instead. lol well...it was totally freaky.   btw, i just looked over at the fish and theres one up to the glass lookina t me and hes got his HUGE ass string of shit hangin outta his fishie butt. ew...gross. lol hahaha i just put my hand up to him and he swam away, but only some of it broke off...ewww gross. a constipated fish. EWWW and omg..theres another one!! its just hanging outta it! WHATS WRONG WITH THESE FISH?! omg..2 constipated fish in the same tank..wow..maybe i should stop feeding them every morning. haha   I bought 2 pairs of sunglasses today. a pink pair and a clear pair. they're really cute in my hair..i might as well wear em like that.  Mom is on her way to hondorus..hip hip hooray. hope her and her bf are enjoying my fuckin trip. at least she'll bring be back a new purse or something LV cuz she prob feels bad about me being away in tenn and not being able to go on the trip..oh and guess what? john, roberta, and zack and me and my bros and mom are all taking a trip next summer..john wants to go on a disney cruise. hey, thats fine with me. but mom would like for us ALL to go to hondorus..excuse me, but im not going to hondorus with a 4yr old and roberta. she cant stay sober in her own home with her child, so i dont even wanna see her in a town where she can be thrown in jail for no reason. no..noooo. not me. i'll go with MY family as in my bros and mom. a disney cruise would be cool though. we can all be entertained on that one. oh and did i mention mom and john wanna take small trips to like purto rico and shit. umm..that pisses me off, why? CUZ WE NEVER GO ON FAMILY VACATIONS EXECPT TO THE DAMN BEACH AND WE DONT EVEN DO THAT EVERY YEAR and now shes gonna jump a plane and leave everyone here?! HELL NO. ugh..lol thats not fair. she hardly even eats dinner at her own home with her own damn family, shes certainly not leaving us alone for a week so she can have a vacation. and anyways, johns into "family" stuff, where the whole family can enjoy something. muhahah my mommie got stuck with someone who LIKES to be with her kids. too damn bad. lol   im gonna go play some guitar, im finally gettin the chords down and changing between all of them smoothly.   *much love and phish food*

      OMG if i hear anything else about being a fuckin model from allyson im gonna SCREAM. i mean..really scream. shes always like "i know someone who knows someone" or "my aunt knows someone who used to know someone" and then after i say "oh cool" she says "j! im gonna make it!!" and im like..yeah..if all the sudden models have no boobs and braces. and did i mention she has no shape what so ever? not even a lil hip. like, shes like a mini boy. i cant even imagine having 'skeeter bites for boobies. but anways, right now shes all about how its her big break and all this shit. and then when i tell her the story about what happened today with my guitar..or anything with guitar actually she'll change the subject or just said "mmkay" or "ok". when i told her i wanted to get a guitar she tried to fuckin talk me outta it saying stuff like "it doesnt happen over nite" and "its really hard to do...are u sure?" and im like "listen her skeeter bite boobies if i want a fuckin guitar im gonna get one" i mean..come on!! UGH GRRR AHHH!! well, just cuz she cant play guitar herself and shes been tryin to a while doesnt mean im gonna suck at it. god i hope i get great and she still sucks ass.   *much love and happy grass*

      Today has been intresting. I went over to a family friends house, hes basically family to my dad, and i was gonna get him to tune my guitar because ive tried numerous times and im about to freakin smash it!! lol anyways, we go over there and he starts tryin to tune and yeah..he looked like he knew what he was doing. so anyways, after that he starts playing a song on it and his (im gonna be poliet) "brain damaged" 13-year old granddaughter comes up and pulls at one of the strings...the thinnest string....and it snaps. ugh i wanted to SCREAM OMG WHAT THE HELL ARE U DOIN LET HER MESS WITH OTHER PEOPLES STUFF, I KNOW SHE DOESNT UNDERSTAND BUT HEY!! THATS MY GUITAR STRING SHE JUST FUCKIN BROKE! i finally get the damn thing in tune..and then i cant play it. SO..Charlie (the family friend) says to me "well usually when u get a new guitar the strings arent that great, they give you the cheapest strings so they break easily. you need to really go down to the guitar place and have them put some medium strings on there and re-tune it and pick ya up a book about guitars." he didnt even tell his granddaughter "no" or "dont touch, its not urs" hell, sometimes i wish i was retarded and could run around breaking things too. okay..so maybe i dont mean that, because trust me, i feel for her and i understand myself that she doesnt understand. it just takes a few minutes to get over the intial anger. WELL...my dad figured charlie knew what he was talking about and we deiced to get better strings put on the guitar. cuz after all, charlie knows everything about guitars. We go to the guitar store and tell the guy a string broke and the story about how we're lookin for better strings because we were told mine werent basically worth shit. (i'll use my terms) and the "expert guitar" dude looks at it and says "well, these are actually expensive strings and they dont get much better than this" wow..my cheap ass strings that arent worth shit turned out to be good strings charlie. We paid a whole $5 to get one string replaced. Then i asked him to make sure it was in tune. Was it? dammit no. it was tuned too high and "that makes the strings pop" UGH dammit charlie!!!! lol While i was in there i got this book and cd he recmmended and he offered lessons and all and i told him i was from outta town. he asked me if i went to UNC..wow that made me feel good. everyone has always thought i was at least 2 years younger than i really am. pisses me off..but here he was askin me about college. haha i was wearing a unc colored shirt..so maybe that was it. I did tell him that i want to go there one of these days. I decided to pick up a guitar strap while i was in there also. I could either get one that tied onto the guitar or get a lil screw thing to hold the one i already have. Same price. I decided to just buy one that ties on to the neck. I could get a solid color..so i got blue. I wanted pink..but u know, they didnt have it of course. and i can always upgrade lol There was a hot dude about my age workin in there tuning electric guitars. I was like..dude..whoa ur hot..i didnt say that of course, but i sure thought it. I didnt realize he was sittin there and i walked over to look at this awesome pink electric guitar and i said.."hey dad! theres a hot pink one kinda like this online but it has glitter!!" haha the guy looked up at me and im like..i bet i just sounded soo stupid. HEY MAN I WANT A HOT PINK AND GLITTER GUITAR!! hahahaha omg..i need to stop sayin stupid shit.   Then we went to O'Charley's for lunch. i got a salad and these 2 hot college dudes from down the road at MTSU (near the house). One had blonde wavy hair just like a hot surfer dude would have. He was very nice to the waitress i noticed. She was young, but not attractive in my opinion. You could tell she thought they were hot! haha just seein her face. I was surprised he said "please" and "thank you" and called her "ma'am" even when ordering his cold beer. lol   I went to see the movie The Terminal. I love Tom Hanks! but that has to be the worest movie hes ever been in. 3 outta 5 stars. I give it 3 beacuse i felt bad for his character and i liked how he made friends and how much they supported him in the airport. There were a couple of laughs, 2 really hard laughs, no tears, and a handful of smiles. The ending sucked ass. lol   Did you know that Napoleon gave his wife a gold necklace with a locket on it and inside he had "destiny" written in it. That's the only quote that stayed in my head from that movie.

DAMMIT!!! oh well..im sure everyone wanted to know that. hahahaha   I think i have "paranoia" when i drive or when i find myself in a car with someone and theres a lot of traffic and we're going over 45mph. lol that sounds so fucked up. but i find myself checkin the mirrors before my dad switches lanes, like hes not looking or something. and i saw this dude standin on the side of the road and he looked like a thug and i swear i had a mental thought "dude..what if he sudden pulled a gun out?" dammit..am i going INSANE?! i gotta stop that shit. hahaha

      to start off..IM SO PROUD OF LAUREN! she totally made out with a stoner! :p gotta love it. haha and it was her first kiss..lol im glad she got that outta the way, i know shes glad..lol cuz i mean, she used to be really like "UGH ive never been kissed!!" haha congrats, ur not yet a girl, not yet a woman. hahahaha thank u britney. u know i think that song is about her sex transformation. yeah..thats it. she was born a guy, and is now a girl! i mean, shes not a girl..so shes got the boobs and the pretty face and body, but i bet shes still packin heat, so shes not yet a woman. wow thats deep shit.   Oh, i went on this hot date with 2 guys. Ben and Jerry. OMG FANTASTIC! They hit just the spot...:p we sat around eating cookie dough ice cream and watching Bicentennial man and crying tears when Andrew didnt live to hear he was a human...  Today i called my family back home and talked to one of my bros and mom. Mom is excited about going to hondorus. like i predicted earlier in blogs, im not going, and she and her boyfriend are. i told her to buy me something vuitton again and she laughed and said "haha maybe" which means "yes, because i realized what a bitch ive been in the past and now that ur actually gone, i miss you and should have never said half the shit ive said to you" It's funny how people show their love..somehow with me, its always to my back. oh well, i might get a new purse or something outta it. i really want the S-Lock bracelet in the rainbow pattern. :D that would be nice. hahaha   Also, in the phone call, she decided she was going to tell me about my grandfathers health. He's having some heart trouble all of the sudden. He works out everyday, is extremly active, practially has a gym in his house, hes 70 and only semi-retired..and now he can hardly make it up whe stairs without having to sit down. and he has 4 "spells" during one nite. "spells" meaning heart trouble. his heart starts suddenly racing or something, i dont know. I worry about him. How can someones body go from healthy to all the sudden crippling? i dont understand. Most people are like "its ok...ur mom said it wasnt too serious, and this happens to a lot of older people" yeah. but..i still dont believe everything is ok. My granddad is the only one ive known my whole life and hes the smartest man i've ever met. He's patient, i've never heard him cuss (actually, hes never cussed before, execpt saying "damn" when he fell off a horse), ive never heard him yell, and he knows everything there is to know! hes so smart. I know i've complained about driving with him. i hate driving with him! He talks nonstop about how ur not driving right haha. but honestly, i'd give anything to be driving down the road right now with him. My granddad and i have the same birthday, and i cant imagine having a birthday without him there. i mean, one day, i will...but not anytime soon. The thought that things could get worse for him have made me cry all day. When mom told me i instantly had tears running down my cheeks..but i didnt give in to that i was crying. I called to tell him happy fathers day and he wasnt home, so i left a message on the machine, thank god, cuz i would have prob busted out crying when he picked up. Nothing makes me want to go home more. I wish i could go home now actually..just the thought of loosing him makes me want to make sure just incase if anything was to happen, that i would have time...time is all i want. but isnt that what we all want? more time. some people are never on time, others are always on time, some people want less time, others want more time...it's all about time. That statement could be taken many diff ways. take it how u want.   *much love and spring daisies*

      yesterday was intresting. After dad woke me up that morning to go out for a "swim" we got ready and went to a small town called Bell Buckle (it's like Toast back home). We attended their offical moonpie and rc cola festival! haha yay. it was intresting. i saw some cute skaters guys though. its like back home theres never skater dudes anywhere, only a few at school..but i'd call them "prep skaters" cuz they dont look the skating part. lol WELL anyways, here skaters like i like em are all over the place. i better enjoy it while i can.   Everyone got home from Montreat yesterday. :D :D :D i havent talked to lauren yet, but hopefully soon. I talked to andrew..about stupid stuff...lol but i cant ask him ALL about camp cuz he sugarcoats everything and i dont want my quesions like "so did katie fight with anyone" repeated.   I talked to joe last nite about how i hate it when people copy me. such as kristen lambert. i was tellin him about how she copies me and stuff and he copies me too, but he wasnt my main focus. maybe i took care of him too. but he told me to "whoop her" ..what i like to say "kick her ass" but joes weird. i told him i was gonna kick his ass over something and he said "no u wouldnt, cuz then u wouldnt have danny" UGH. lol i said "what if i dont want danny??" and he said "well i guess i'll have to send him to the circus where someone wants him" and i said "aww poor danny. send him to the zoo, they dont starve animals." naw..i'll take him joe. hahaha  Ally only gets excited when shes about talk herself or ur talking to her about her. i hate that.   Ashley and i have become good friends this summer. Its weird..how to become better friends with someone when u arent home? lol we totally crack up. i love that girl. She told me she was seriously "honored" when i laughed at her jokes cuz i was the "queen of all things perverted and funny" hahaha got that right. ;) muhahaha  LAUREN UPDATE UR BLOG SO I KNOW AOBUT MONTREAT!!!! haha cant wait to talk to ya!  *much love and blueberry lotion*

      My dad pays me $50 a week to clean up the living room, kitchen, and dinning room. Well, today i was cleaning up the living room when i came across a fimilar book. It's an address/birthday book. It has this character on it, i dunno, its like this mouse in a tutu. I remember it from when i was little. I looked through it and it had all my childhood friend's phone numbers and all of jack's friend's numbers. Jack had scribbled a lot in it, writting my name over and over through out it, because i had turned 1yr when we got the book. The book was divided into seasons and during winter he wrote "januaray is julia's birthday. it's cool" lol and he wrote the same friends phone numbers all through out this little book. We kept this book for years and years, so as i got older i too began to write in it. It went from Jack writting me name to me writting my name. This book has about 7 years worth of birthdays and phone numbers in it. As i flipped through it tears started running down my cheeks. I stopped and thought "why am i crying?" is it because i miss those days when my family was a whole or is it because my dad held on to it? Maybe it's a little of both. It just may be a little birthday/address/phone number book, but it shows my childhook all at the same time. To my 1st birthday to me writting my name and jack's side by side. So many memories are tied into that book. Even my babysitter, whom i still have vivid memories of, the first black lady i ever knew. lol i even asked her once while her son had a white Buddy Doll when he was black. She told me they didn't make black Buddy Dolls.   I'm going guitar searching again today. I really wanna get that one online, even though it will take like a week to get here. dammit!! i want it now! Maybe i'll find on in town though and get the same kind deal..i hope so.   I tried calling lauren yesterday at montreat, even her cabin, but no one answered. lol i thought she would have liked the surprise but i left her a message on her cell phone. miss ya babes!!  *much love and grape soda*

      I just got done talkin to bailey. Joe is gone to the beach until wednesday and he called her about an hour ago and they talked for a few mins. She told him how she put me and danny in her prayer box and he informed her that him and danny had been talkin about me. but he didnt say what exactly about. i take it there were people around. anyways, now im scared to death. haha i thought maybe he would talk to danny but then again i thought he wouldnt. i esp. didnt wanna think about the things said. I know they were nothing but great things though. bailey gave me another sad story about how joe is obessed with me or something. He used to always say "its all gravy" and i always said "its all grape jelly" and well..now hes started saying "its all grape jelly" too..and when bay told someone "its all gravy" joe corrected her, like butted into her convo and said "no bailey, its 'its all grape jelly!' get it right!" it really hurt her feelings. He does it again with my own greeting..i always say "hey u!" to people and umm..he does too now apparently. I told her the next time he does it just to tell him "i know julia is cool and all but stop tryin to be her!!" lol maybe he'll stop if she calls him out on it. idk..prob not. I told her i'd start using my word "naked" again, i used to say "naked" instead of cool and we're gonna see if he says it. he prob wont cuz its stupid and she said no he prob wont cuz he doesnt like the word or something. so then i decided that me and joe are gonna make up a word and see if he uses it. i bet he will... at least he'll say good things to danny. gosh, everytime i think of him my hearts starts to beat super fast and im like "uuuugh i so want things to work out!!" and "i cant wait to meet him!" and "i'd date him right now without ever seeing him" why? cuz hes everthing ive ever asked for.The beat goes on.  ugh its frustrating. the outcome will prob not favor me. thats just my luck. i told bay that joe liked telling me about danny and if joe liked me he wouldnt wanna talk about me gettin with his friend u know. but bay said, yeah he prob wants u to get with him so he can see u all the time. ooo please!! whatever. i'll update on what was said with danny as soon as i find out!! I MISS U LAUREN!!   OH yeah, tomorrow im going to look at guitars and hopefully buy one!! yay!! and start lessons! isnt that awesome? yup sho is! lol

      Back in the day, and im talking umm..4 years ago, katie easter and i were like BEST friends. well, kaela has always been my BEST friend, but at MAMS katie and i were always together. We spent the nite and gossiped and just did stupid lil girl things. Then i learned she was a backstabbing bitch. lmao WELL...9th grade came along some odd years later and we were "civil". I think she learned that some friends were true friends (like me) and others were fake (the popular kids she idolized) so we could sometimes chat, go to the mall and of course walmart. Well, this summer shes been extra sweet to me and we talk all the time, and she tells me when i get home we're gonna have to hang out some and how i need to call her while im in tenn. and all this stuff. im actually talkin to her right now. And im like.."why all the sudden is she acting like my best friend when we havent been real good friends in years" umm..oh well. I'm nice and u know, maybe rebuilding a friendship with her isnt all that bad. It could be worse..like catherine wood! hahaha Anyways, ive decided its either cuz shes dating this hot new dude and wants to brag or shes honestly intrested in talking. hmm only time will tell.   i was updating my yahoo profile last nite and came up with the cutest quote!!  "u'll never know how much you mean to someone unless you let them know how much they mean to u" AWW isnt that sweet?! and i made that up!! haha  *much love* ~keep ur fingers crossed for me and danny~

      Okay, so heres the thing on danny boy. He's "talking" to someone..but u know ive talked to people and not dated them...so maybe he wont date her. but even if she does, then they wont date forever..and he'll know me..and maybe after her..or whatever. who knows. anyways, on my list i had blue eyes and bay told me he had brown eyes so i made that expection haha but come to find out, he does have blue eyes. I swear, the better he gets and sounds the farther away he is from my reach. Does that make sense? Well, this is what was said:  Joe: hey, me and bay got this friend who wants to date a skater and his name needs to be danny!! Danny: *big smile* haha thats the sweetest   OKAY..now danny baby, think about it..someone who doesnt know u and ur their "mr perfect" come on!! thats more than sweet!! thats meant to be dammit. lol  So bay is gonna go wednesday and just tell him the whole damn story about the list and about how we're perfect for each other and everything. Maybe he'll listen. Bay is really upset, she says she isnt..but i know she is. Her boyfriend has this major thing for me. She was given a Louis Vuttion purse for her grad. present and i got one for christmas and her bf didnt say "oo thats cool" or "wow!" but the first thing outta his mouth was "omg! julia has one of those!! hers is soo awesome!" i mean..those were his words. What a bitch. COME ON JOE!! ur suppose to be hookin me up with ur friend!! Bay said shes not mad and shes ok, but that her bf is like obessed with me. Hes always bringing me up and stuff, makes me feel bad actually. But then again, it does give bay more will to get me taken by danny haha and joe prob cant say enough good things..so thats good. lol Oh and i hear danny has straight white teeth and a pretty smile...that was on the list. dammit. Bay told me she wish something like this would happen to her where her "mr perfect" was a real live walking person. Yeah...he may be my peuguin (they search and search until they find those one other special peuguin and they stay with just that one forever) but who is to say im his? u would think it would all work out, u know, ur soulmate is one person and that same persons soulmate is u. Maybe it works that way, and maybe hes just gotta find that out. haha but hes perfect..i couldnt ask for more.   Something funny kinda happened today with danny too. I was telling ashley about how people at my dads church jump around and dance and stuff. Well, ironically, danny goes to the same type of church with joe and bay and i asked bay how church was and if it was loud or whatever, and of course it is. and she informs me, 2 seconds after i told ash that "i bet he doesnt dance..i mean..come on...", bay tells me that danny dances in church and how funny and awesome it is cuz he taps his foot and claps lol. HAHA..right after i tell ash i hope he doesnt. haha but oh well, i then found out he goes to church by himself, that has to say a lot about him. Hes dedicated. Maybe God tell him that hes meant for me :D haha Idk..but bay has one of those prayer box necklaces and she wrote on the paper "julia and danny together" and stuck it in her prayer box. She loves that thing. Everything she's every put in there has happened. She told me she'd get me one for a get well gift after my surgery. AWWW lol anyways, ashley is lighting a candle for me too!! hahaha i really want this in my life, i want a guy who is like my list..and here he is. right there. the more and more perfect for me he is the harder he is to get. I told ashley about bay's prayer box and called it her "holy 8-ball" haha i found it funny.   I guess i'll eat a few more bites of my cheddar cheese chex mix and flavored sparkling water beverage and then go to bed..it is only after 3am...

      okay, so today is sunday!! yay!! hahaha i got up this morning and went to church with daddy, to his very loud, entergetic church...i described it today as being a Jesus pep rally hahaha i thought that was pretty damn good. Theres people behind us that sound like snakes...and it gets on my nerves and its weird. i dont like it. Then, theres a hot guy that sits behind me at like a diagonal, i tend to always turn and look at him through out the service..haha im sure he notices, i mean, how couldnt u? but i dont care, hes hot. hahah hes a skater, and he has the coolest hair. its sandy colored and kinda curly at the ends, maybe wave-y is better to use. but hes hot!! haha im tempted to ask him his name next week. After the jesus pep rally dad and i went to the mall and i found a Dooney and Burke purse i want REALLY bad and its $155 or a lil more...i can make that in about a lil over a week!! hahaha but i think i'll check out the guitars down the street and if they are reasonably priced i'll get one of those first and get the purse later. There is a lil purse, its tiny with a strap on it, something like u'd take to a bar with ur id and lip gloss in it and theres a wallet, both around $55. I might as well go all out and get the purse if im gonna spend that kinda money. lol   All i could really think about today was what bailey and joe were saying or have said to danny today. They spent forever on the phone last nite talkin over what they would say to him. GOSH i hope they said good things and hes intrested. lol WELL..i would know what all happened if one of them would get the hell online!! but nooo..make julia wait. i want everything to work out...even if he was ugly (and i hear hes a cutie) it really wouldnt matter, cuz i mean..he fits the list!!! haha and that must say something about him if he can fit my stupid lil list that was meant to be funny not really happen. And u can make boys cute..hell, i could take an ugly boy and make him hot hahaha Anyways, wish me luck!!! :D

      Today i called my mom, but glenn said she wasnt home, so i talked to my bro for like almost an hour...and then all the sudden hes like "oh moms home..shes been home.." UGH so i talked to her for about 15mins. I told them all the stuff i was doing and made it sound as boring as possiable..well to glenn at least. hes upset cuz according to him hes not having any fun, and im having all the fun, and thats just not fair! lol We had a nice lil convo and i needed to call first of all cuz my grades were mailed to the house the other day...and if i was there i could at least see them before mom, and knowing her, she wouldnt have even asked for them. But nooo..she gets my grades first. So i called, and she said they were good, she couldnt remember all of them. but i was like *whew!* thats over. I told her i would call back for my classes next week when i know they've come in.   I was talkin to joe today about Danny. Well, that wasnt what we were talkin about first, i told him i wanted to get fake boobs. and he laughed. and then i said "naw, ive got enough boobs" and he said "yeah i wouldnt get boobs either, mine are too big" and  said "sooo joe, u have boobs now?!" wow!! haha and then i was like "so does danny have boobs cuz u know, thats not on the list" and joe said this...  Joe: yeah actually he wears a man bra because he broke his collar bone Me: seriously?! Joe: yeah, he broke it skating Me: he still skates right? Joe: yeah lol   okay..so maybe it was too good to be true...danny wears a freakin man bra. hahaha naw, i know what hes talkin about, and its just to support his back or whatever. oh well..that still wasnt on the list! BUT WHO CARES?! SKATING AND BREAKIN UR COLLARBONE AND THEN CONT. TO SKATE IS DEF. BADASS!! haha

      Yay..today was been boring so far. All ive done since 9:45 is work on putting those stupid pictures in those stupid plastic sleeve things. UGH i did like 200 of them this morning and 300 yesterday, so far i have 500 done...outta 1000. WOW! lol i still have 500 to go!! well, 400some, cuz i almost have another 100 done. I'll be glad when im done because then i'll get paid. My dad wants me to be done with them tonite. DUDE! he means by 6pm that is. right now here, its a quarter til 1. I know i can do it..but u know, i have other things to do! no one is online to talk to..but i did want to put some of my tanner stuff on. The weather is taking a turn for the worse and the sun isnt staying out and its suppose to rain all weekend. sound fun? well sounds like my bragging about pretty weather caught with me...haha Its beautiful weather, if ur a frog. But anyways, back to the tanner. My cousin kaye told my dad before i wore my skirt that i needed some color on me and i cant wear hose with the shoes im wearing...ugh. lol yeah, my legs are white, and yeah they sometimes get color on them when i go outside, but it doesnt last long. SOOOOO kaye told my dad to buy me sunless tanner. and what did we do at walmart last nite after watching some oldie singer preform (kim carnes or something) we bought sunless tanner. UGH haha i mean, ive tried to use it before, and it never works on me right, so im dreading having to put it on cuz i know it will just mess up! and u know what, im wearing sandels, so that means i gotta do my ankle (UGH) and feet (UGH) so no fake ass tan lines. but hey, at least its fake. i much rather go get airbrushed though. that might be fun...lol at least it would look right. i'll try my best! i got the Bulid A Tan, the lightest thing, so u can go back and put more on to make it darker. so it should be idiot proof...just maybe.   I had the weirdest dream last nite. I was with a lot of people, including my dad, and it felt like family. and we were in this big nice restraunt, and we were all looking at what to order and my grandfather told me to order this soup, and u know clover when it gets those purple blossoms? well it was a soup with those things in it!! i mean, it was like flower soup. So i told him i didnt like flower soup and he made me taste it, and i remember it being good, but i still didnt want to eat flowers. So then i got a salad and my dad got BBQ. WELL...they brought him this plate, and it had a mini cow on it. i mean, seriously..a mini live cow. Now, this cow was so cute. It looked like a baby kitten, it was that size, like u could just pick it up and hold it. It looked so innocent. It sat on his plate just looking around and i was like..aww a baby cow!! WELL, my dad picks up his knife, and the idea is to chop off the cows head and then that kills it and u can eat it. ...all i could think of was eating that thing after it was dead and seeing its udders.. haha i know that sounds funny. well he takes his knife and starts to cut its head off and i put my hands over my ears cuz i dont wanna hear it if it makes any noises and i cover my face in the womans sholder beside me. I'm screaming and im ilke NOOO DONT HURT THE LITTLE COW PLEASE DADDY!! and i look and hes sawing away on its head, and i coud see bone, and the whole thing. it was very realistic, execpt for the size of the lil cow. and i turn back away and im like NOOO PLEASE. and then finally, i look over and its layin lifeless with its head to one side and my dad is like "now time to eat!".   It was weird. But its so true. We kill cows (i dont know how..maybe we do cut their heads off..) everyday and its no big deal, and there are people who are screaming NOO DONT KILL THE COW!!! and theres the people like "yay ready to eat!!"...idk...i still like meat, but it was a wild dream.

      okay! Today was intresting. I found out more about this danny kid and the more and more that came outta joe's mouth, the more he fit my damn list. Now, first i was thinking...wow u know this kid fits my list, i could talk to him a lil over the net, meet him when i get home, and u know, maybe my luck will roll around and we'll hit it off. BUT, Danny boy has a gf. Now according to joe, and get this, joe thinks everything is "sexy as hell" from me to the old lady who sits in the front pew at church with her cane and hearing aids. So, i know joe will tell danny good things whether its "dude shes hot" to "dude shes freakin awesome" i know good things will come outta his mouth. But thats not my point, my point is dannys girl. According to joe, shes "ewww" shes kinda punkish, not to put down punk girls, joe even likes them. But he said..absoulutly not to this chick. How bad can she be? Her bf fits my god damn list and my list is nuttin but my materalistic childish dreamy point of views, and nothing on that list had to do with really personality, it was more of a lifestyle and fashion to be honest. BUT, how bad could he really be, he fits my list!! So how did this "ewww" girl get such a "great" guy (according to my list) haha i love talkin about my "list" it...it sounds so stupid. haha but anyways, joe told me that him and danny have the same taste in girl, execpt he doesnt know why danny likes/liked that punk girl (he doesnt know if they are still together) but then he said "if that means anything" my problem with joe is he talks about me all dreamy eyed to his GIRLFRIEND. and his gf and i are friends. Makes her upset i know, i wish he'd stop. but it could be to my advantage..that means he'll tell danny lots of nice things. lol Did i mention danny also plays guitar and drives a jeep?? those things were on the list. haha I havent even met danny yet and im already like DAMMIT HES TAKEN..lauren totally hit the nail on the head with that one! She was right, im getting obessed with a dude i dont know. but he fits my list!! hahaha  I was sittin here on the computer talkin to lauren and joe and of course im a very loud person, so i yell OMG NOOO FAIR!! when i heard joe thought danny had a gf, and well the bug man let himself into the house, so i hear a "uhh hello...??" and i got all embarrassed, and not he wasnt hot.   I dont know danny, but he fits..yea...my list..haha and i mean, thats a rockin list..haha :D so i want things to work out, at least meet the guy.   My mom, grandma and granddad called me this morning, it was great to talk to them, but i was basically asleep. lol   I'm gonna miss not talkin to lauren when she goes to montreat this sunday!! :(( BOOO HOOO!! haha i'll give her a call on her cell!   I wanna get my haircut like Robin off The Real World (my fave show of over 6 yrs) but not how she has it flat in the show, but how she has it on the website. And i was like thinkin of how it would look and u know what...it would look like that girl off of Made who wanted to be a skater..and u know what..i like skaters...haha WELL the weidest things just happen to me!! haha   Oh and 8-ball said " u may rely on it" to "will danny break up with his gf for me" LMAO. hey hey hey, 8 balls never lie "will lauren get her guy like on the list i made for her?"--"most likely" THERE YA GO LAUREN!  *much love*

      haha lauren, sounds like u had some strange dreams, but a good time at the beach! :D haha hot guys are always a plus!! dammit..i miss being there....ughhhh. im in the mood to watch The Never Ending Story 1-3 really bad! my stat right now on yahoo is actually "i love atreyu and his horse artex and that big white fluffy flyin thing!" haha. its a good movie.  i went shopping today with kaye at the mall. we had a GREAT time. first, we went to this place called The Front Pourch Cafe, which inside looks like an old house where you would have tea. They had the best food and the waiter dude was HOT. lol its a really nice place. We talked about all kinds of stuff...she brought up a lot of stuff i wouldnt really wanna talk about, and she shared with me how her was treated by her mom..her mom, my aunt holt, kicked her outta the house her junior year and wanted nothing to do with her..sound fimilar? by the end of our conversation both of our eyes had filled with tears. she must know how to hold hers back better than i do..i was sittin there in this beautiful room with tiny tears streaming down my face. She completely understood. She's been through a lot of the same stuff i have suprisingly. Shes 47..but we relate so well. She acts 16 though! haha its funny.  We then went to the mall and dad told her to just buy whatever i liked and he would write her a check when he got home. Well, i found some skirts and some shirts cuz i needed dressy things. WELL..according to kaye, u have to have matching shoes and jewerly and a purse for EVERY outfit...damn...so we went shoe and jewerly and purse shopping. OMG sooo much fun!! We found the coolest shoes, like 4 pairs and i got them all! lol i also got some orange candie flip flops and she made me promise i would go find a rockin orange shirt to go with it..haha i said okie dokie! dad agreed i could buy one orange tee..cuz the rule is, no tees or jeans until all dress clothes are taken care of.   Dad and i then went to Logans, which is like a Sagebrush. We hot a hot waiter also...lol   OMG just remembered the funniest damn thing EVER: okay, kaye is a teacher and one of her classes is "human sexuality". her mom asked her how oral sex was preformed on girls by girls and on girls by guys..omg mother of pearl..my aunt is like 60 some!! well kaye is like OMG MOM UVE NEVER HAD ORAL SEX?! AND UVE BEEN MARRIED FOR HOW LONG?! hhahahahs piss piss piss my pants!!! well kaye then says...well its just a bunch of licks and kisses. but kaye told her mom she was missin out. hahaha nice one kaye. i love her to death!!   Kaye also eats katsup on everything like me..lol and my dad says breakfast the way i do..brack-fast hahaha not break-fast. lol oh well...funny stuff. anyways, im having a great time with kaye and dad. usually its just those 2 i enjoy being around.   *much love*

      i forgot to mention my new job!! haha yea, i have a job..and its sooo cool. Okay, my dads friend, Fred, is buddies with all these movie stars and stuff and has a business selling their pictures and autographs. Well, i put all the pics and stuff into a plastic bag so he can ship it. lol thats my job. And another cool thing, Fred's gf is Shirley Eaton, a JAMES BOND CHICK. She lives in London and is an actress. She called and i got to talk to her. She was the girl in Goldfinger. Shes really cool. She told me when she comes and visits Fred this summer she'll take me shopping and out to lunch. Isnt that cool?! Shes actually been in movies..and made out with freakin James Bond...omg im so jealous. hahaha shes cool though. Im gonna get some autographed james bond stuff..awesome, even though i honestly hated the movies!! but shhhh. lol i did play the video games..with my bros of course. Anyways, its cool looking at all the pics and everything. I like to look at his personal pics better though, they arent professional, they arent the ones he sells. Anyways, he told me i could have anything i wanted for FREE. how cool is that?! lol yeah..i saw a pic of Geine Kelly..or whatever his name is, Catherine Wood's lil idol and i was like HAHA i bet if i got one i could sell it to her..haha or just rub it in her face that i had an autographed pic of him. lol to me autographed pics arent that exciting, unless i was there to get it done. umm..oh well, thats just me. anyways..it would still be cool.   Tomorrow Kaye is coming to get me about 1pm and we're going to her fave shoe store and out to lunch and to do some "pre-shopping" because me, kaye and dad are going out tomorrow evening to shop for me...more dress clothes. ughhh. At least Kaye will be there. lol Anyways, that should be fun. yay *much love*

      okay, i have exciting news!!! BRANDIE HAD A BABY!!! now, ive never written about brandie in my blog before, but we used to be close friends in middle school, and then in high school we never had any classes together so we kinda drifted, even though we still talk and stuff like that...well...she had a baby!! She had it the last week of school, that would explain why she missed the last day of school and her exams...but get this, she didnt tell any of her friends. OMG we would have totally supported her and would have kept out mouths shut about it. I told someone one day i thought brandie looked pregant and they looked at me like i was crazy, and then some started agreeing, but we never had enough balls to ask brandie, even though we all knew her and zach s. never used condoms and have been bangin for years now. I think shes lucky it just now caught up with her. But anyways, im excited for her, and i cant wait to get home and see the baby!! We dont even know if its a boy or girl...Lauren, Hollis and Zack A found out by calling her and her sister saying "she cant talk on the phone, shes feeding the baby" ...opps. well, we're all excited for her and cant wait to see the little thing!! i bet its sooo cute, brandie is a very pretty girl, so i bet the baby takes after her. Brandie will make a great mother..shes just that way. I do wonder what zach s' preacher father said about the baby...ummm...hahaha Brandie and Zach have been dating since 7th grade, and now we're going into 11th..thats a long ass time. Well, i can only wish them the best!! :D *much love* oh and LAUREN IS BACK!! YAY!! SHES BACK!!! IVE MISSED HER SOO MUCH!! SHES BACK!! YAY!!!!! stupidassmotherfuckerleavesmeallthedamntimebitch

      okay, so today i went to church with my dad and let me say one thing..OMG i was scared to death! he goes to a nondemonataional whatever church and its just like a WOW christian music cd commerical. im def. not use to anything like that. I enjoy my church time a quiet experience with an organ, they didnt have an organ! they had freakin DRUMS! The people yell, the preacher cries, he tells u to put ur hands in the air..so i pretended to look at my nails...he makes u touch people..i didnt like it one bit. im shocked my dad goes there! i mean, he was raised in a quiet church! oh well..im not dissin it, i mean, go to church, thats what matters, but idk..it was too new for me. Its a beautiful buliding though, its like $30million worth. It seats over 22,000 people and has a balcony and all...its cool, but wow..and its an hour and a half long! And its like worse than church camp. i didnt like it one bit. But hey, then again, it was "gods house" but he must have moved..cuz thats not how i remember "gods house". but anyways...AMEN!!!!! haha omg..i was terrified! but..hey for some people thats their thing. and u know what, they talked about how bad gays are, and then they said "we're all unique and god made us that way so we should love each other for their uniquness. and i was like..WTF? u just said people with differences were bad?! lol ok...whatever. im all for gays. *rainbows and butterflies* cuz i mean, not everyone in this world is christian, and what if there was a religion who said "u gotta be gay" and we made it so gays couldnt get married..does that mean we dont let freedom of relgion happen?? umm...whatever. Anyways, i think the chour director at that church is gay..he looks like an older clay akien or whatever. seriously. Gays might wanna go to church too..so u know..gosh i hate this whole thing about gays!! just let them be!! its only like 10% of the population! Its not like the world is comin to an END! ughh..pisses me off.   *much love*

      i just got back from my cousin Kaye's house with her and her husband, aunt holt and dad. We had an awesome time!! Her girls are off in college, so she doesnt have anyone to hang out and shop with. We're going shopping tuesday and to dinner and then just me and her are going (dad is goin on the tuesday trip) to shoe places and to lunch. :D She is so cool! Now, i now where i got some of my mannerisms that no one else has on my moms side. lol My aunt Holt gave me this cute lil bracelet, and it was really nice to see her. She thought i was 14...that kinda pushed a button, but i smiled and didnt correct her until later when i was asked about my grade in school. We ate hamburgers outside by Kaye's pool and talked. It was very intresting. Kaye is a teacher at MTSU and runs the Alternative school with her husband. We talked all about the differences between the schools systems of mt airy and murfreesboro. Quite a difference! lol We watched the horse race..oh gosh..what's it called...the...Belmont! haha yeah the Belmont! We were all hoping that Smartie Jones would win because if he did then he would get the triple crown! Meaning, he would have won the 3 major races and get like 50 million dollars...well, he had the lead just as the race was ending when Birdstone came outta no where and stole the race!! It was almost like watching a football game!! My dads side of the family is big on horse races, i used to go to them all the time when i was a kid. I hated being asked if i remembered Kaye or Aunt Holt, i said yes, because i did, but when asked about Kaye's husband Mike..i just said "well u know its been like forever!" i had no clue who he was. but omg..for a 46 yr old dude, he didnt look half bad! haha hes all built and hes a "sports physiciatrist" or something like that. lol it sounded so funny but its kinda cool. Hes also a teacher and he teaches a number of things at the alt. school as well as karate. Hes really cool. I was glad to find my "2nd half" again. I hope everything else goes well also. *much love*

      i just got in from having my hair done and eating mexican on a beautiful saturday morning/afternoon. I called my house, no one was home, so i left another message. I then called my grandparents and my grandma answered. I talked to her a little bit, prob. the only time i was really happy to hear her voice. I mean, ive been happy before, but this is the most happiest ive been to hear it. Here's the only grandmother i've like known all my life, even when i lived states away. This is the family that's always been there for me. And now, im stuck a state away with my loving father, but with his family who hasnt given a damn about me. I told my grandma i was going to go see my "aunt" Holt soon and she reminded me of what she said, just give her a chance. Sure, i'll give her a chance, the chance she never ever gave me. After i hung up i started to cry, in fact, i have tears running down my face down. Im trying to hold them back because we're going again here soon to see her and my "cousin" Kay, and i dont want to ruin my makeup. This is my time to show how much i've grown and how much she and the rest of the family has missed out on.   My dad took me to this little old village that is suppose to preserve the town as it used to be. Everything there has something to do with the Lynch's. I swear, half the town was my grandfathers or his dads. and my dad shows me all of this stuff that was his families...and i honestly feel like i should actually care and be like "whoa..thats so AWESOME" but i dont...  When i went to get my hair done we went to this place that is inside the families home. my first thought was kitchen chair or basement stool (haha) haircuts, but nope, they turned their lil basement area, almost like its own buliding into this really cool hair place. The man and his wife are like family, they are such good friends, and they are sooo funny! the guy got out his guitar and played me "feliz navidad" haha i wanted to roll on the floor. He then sang me a Barney song haha. He has 2 daughters, one who cut my hair, shes grown witha family, shes really loud..i mean, her voice is LOUD. and he has another who just grad. high school. She'll turn 18 on sunday. They're gonna have a cookout and invite us over, he said there were a lot of cute guys..haha Hes a trip. I'm going to go back later before i come home and get mulitcolor highlites/lowlites. I'm getting my bleach blonde redone but adding some browns, like carmel, and some darker reds...haha yay! it's almost like a britney spears meets christina a. yeah...but minus christinas sluty-ness. lol and of course britney's body..haha i wish i looked like that!  Right now im talkin to Todd Simmons and telling him about how that freshman kid got "turned on" by me in this tutu i had to wear for a play and my hair in pigtails and me with a belt..and a leash tied around my neck..dont ask why i had a belt and a leash, it just seemed funny at the time. haha He's loving it. He said when i get home we're gonna have to hang out. gosh...i like todd...hes so hot...hahaha

      oh wow! i took a personality disorder test and lets see what i am...  Disorder | Rating Paranoid: Low Schizoid: Low Schizotypal: Moderate Antisocial: Low Borderline: Low Histrionic: High Narcissistic: Low Avoidant: Low Dependent: Moderate Obsessive-Compulsive: Low   WOW!! and what is HISTRIONIC? lets find out!   People with histrionic personality disorder are constant attention seekers. They need to be the center of attention all the time, often interrupting others in order to dominate the conversation. They use grandiose language to discribe everyday events and seek constant praise. They may dress provacatively or exaggerate illnesses in order to gain attention. They also tend to exaggerate friendships and relationships, believing that everyone loves them. They are often manipulative.   wow...somehow that sounds EXACTLY like me!!! it even was right about being manipulative...catherine has a car, so what..alright, i can be nice from school to my house...like no one else has done that!

      Here's the song im listening to right now. It's a really good, mellowed out, slow song. :D   Butterfly - Weezer  Yesterday i went outside With my momma's mason jar Caught a lovely butterfly When I woke up today Looked in on my fairy pet She had withered all away No more sighing in her breast  I'm sorry for what I did I did what my body told me to I didn't mean to do you harm Everytime I pin down what I think I want it slips away There it goes; slips away  Smell you on my hand for days I can't wash away your scent If I'm a dog then you're a bitch I guess you're as real as me Maybe I can live with that Maybe I need fantasy Life of chasing butterfly  I'm sorry for what I did I did what my body told me to I didn't mean to do you harm Everytime I pin down what I think I want it slips away There it goes; slips away  I told you I would return When the robin makes his nest But I ain't never coming back I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry

      today was kinda boring...it was raining so i couldnt go out by the pool. I might go tonight thought, i like to swim at nite! haha Anyways, i sat around mainly on the computer. Did you know being on a computer burns calories? i think thats cool. Anyways, well today i figured out just how fast my dads computer is!! i can download a whole cd and burn me a copy in less than 10mins!! so i went to town, getting on www.amazon.com to find cool cds and get the order of the songs, then looked them all up on LimeWire and burned me some cds! i didnt do all the cds i wanted today, because i have to have something to do tomorrow. I burned Avril Lavigne, Jessica Simpson, The O.C. soundtrack, Blink-182, and Yellow Card oh and can't forget Rooney!! 6 cds today...wow....and sometimes if they are short cds i can get 2 on one disk, that saves me some cds! haha Anyways, i have a whole list for tomorrow. :D can't wait. I love music. haha im really bored...thats all...haha.   I called kaela today! i was so excited to call her! haha  I had a bad dream last night, it even made me wake up at 9:30am!! thats too early!! and i woke up crying. I dreamed kaela died. And all i did in my dream was cry and hope she was playing a joke and would come back to me. I know i just missed her, thats why i dreamed it. I told her all about it over the phone and on an email.   *much love*

      HAHAHA OMG LMAO LMAO LMAO! i just had to update!! okay, im searching around on blogger, which i just figured out you can do! So, im looking for any people in Mt. Airy who have blogs. well..im hoping i'll dig up some kids at school and it would be fun to know all about them and how they think...well instead i get some guy named Chris Johnson, and the first thing that pops into my head is "pe coach at school!" haha because his name is chris johnson, but no, its some kid who is 21 and talks about how hes going for this job interview and all..but u know here hes working? AT MY UNCLES BUSINESS! haha okay, i find that amusing. of course its gonna be funny to hear about his work, considering its my families business. Oh the things u can discover. He has a thing about juggling..he likes to juggle. He even juggles in the shower...hmm or maybe he was jk but anyways im almost tempted to go to my uncles work one day, hunt him down and casually ask him if he likes to juggle. LMAO wouldnt that be funny? hey man, u like to juggle? haha and then bring up things. he'd flip. HOW DO U KNOW THAT? dude i read ur blog. LMAO ok..i so wont do that...haha but it would be funny. i wouldnt do it because he'd go search and then see mine. lol

      i just had a major break down moment with allyson. She was telling me about guy troubles and stuff. And somehow i started talking about my dads family and how they havent spoken or seen me in over 10 years. i started crying and telling her all about how my dad saved all my pictures, and poems and everything in his house and displays it. and i told her how there was this gap i needed to fill. and how all i wanted was for his family to take a moment and think about me. Saturday, im going over to my cousin Kay's house where my Aunt Gale will be. Interesting, the names sound so fimilar, but i cant put a face with the name. I think its my Aunt Gale, it might be Aunt Holt..i think it's gale though. She called my dad earlier and told him she would be in town, both aunts live about a little over an hour away from my dads house, and kay is in town. So..maybe they were thinking of me, and thats why she called. I dont know, but she didnt ask to speak to me. My dad said "yeah, shes sitting right here" when he said that i instantly was like.."omg what do i say to them?? just say.."hello, how are you doing? its so nice to hear from you! cant wait to see you.." and all these possiabilites. But does she ask to speak to me? no. I'm sitting there on the couch watching tv and her voice is less than 5 feet away...and she doesnt ask to speak to me? Part of me wishes they regretted now speaking to me in over 10 years. I want them to be embarrassed. I dont want to rebulid a realtionship, even though part of me does. Im confused. But i do all of this for my dad. It means a lot to him. I still dont tell him that i know he really bought the gifts his "sisters" sent me. It almost makes me want to cry again. Thinking of how much he wants me to be accepcted, and how his bitch sisters wont accpect the fact that, yes, i am their realtive by blood. hopefully everything will go smoothly..i hope so. i hope i have to eat all the words i just said. I hope i enjoy them and who knows, we might actually do something fun.   *much love*

      nothing intresting has happened today. I did go lay out by the pool for about 2hrs and then came back in. I didnt get burnt! yay! first time in ages. I even turned a lil brown...wow, im shocked and amazed.   I was sitting in front of the tv watching TRL and hopeing i could catch the new episode of The Real World, where Frankie is gone, because i missed it last nite. I watched Blink 182 new video show for the first time, rocked ass, i love them! Anyways, i was sitting there all by myself eating a grilled chicken bagel sandwhich (yum..instead of bread i use bagels for everything) and i hear the screen door open...and it doesnt shut...and then i hear it shut. and im like HOLY SHIT what was that?! i mean, someone just opened the door, waited for like a minute and then closed it. I was in the same room as the door, but theres a wooden door in front of the screen door so i couldnt see anything. After the blink video i got up and carefully opened the door to find a menu for the new chinese restruant down the road. haha i felt like such an idiot. I was scard a whole 3 minutes over just someone putting a menu in the door. I looked through it, there is actually something called the Pu Pu Plater. I wanetd to call them up and order it and have it delievered but their lunch hours ended at 3:00 and it was already like 4:30. dammit. So i looked through it and decided i might ask dad for something from there for dinner. Right now hes at the dentist.   I called lizzie today and we talked a while. nothing too much was going on. lol   I also read some other peoples blogs. I wonder if other people just browse through blogs like i do. I dont read them completely, just skim them, jumping from month to over other month. Some are stupid, lame, and about some kind of japanese animation-anime. i think that stuff is stupid. I wonder if anyone other than lauren ever reads my blog..i doubt it..haha im not very intresting.   People think its cool here that i go to andy griffths church and school and live in the same town his home as a kid is in. They think its cool that his show is based on my town. Well people...that creek in the begining isnt really in mount airy, its in LA, Cali. And its not like any of the show was actually filmed here..i was even asked if i know Ron Howard. of course not.

      hahaha omg i just got back from my senior citizen line dancing class! haha those old people are a HOOT. i can only hope one day i'll be has...fun...when im old and gray! haha They all knew my grandmother, she had all these titles and all this stuff, def one of the queen bees in town, and they kept asking me all these questions, but the truth, the last time i saw my grandmother was when i was 6 years old. im 16 now, and i know nothing about her. i have a memory or 2, but that is it. and its not even a good memory. i sat there smiling and lying by just agreeing and saying "oh yes, she was certainly a wonderful woman" hell, i didnt know the woman. she choose not to know me. I emailed my dad a letter to give to her when she was in the hosptial, he read it to her just before she died. I'm glad i wrote that letter. I wish i would have saved a copy of it. I wrote nice stuff, nothing like "howcome you didnt call me on my bday and tell me merry christmas?" I did the right thing. These people kept asking me about my uncle and how his health is. supposedly, he's dying, or in "bad health" as most of them said. Did i know that? no. Someone asked me where i got my beautiful blonde hair. "my moms whole family is blonde" and they would say "oh but doesnt your aunt gale have blonde hair?" hell if i know. i figured she must, so i said, yeah she does, maybe i got it from my dads side also. I didnt even know what color hair she had. I'm stuck in this world i feel like im suppose to be a part of, but i feel so distant. I love my dad...and i love his family, but only in a natural, gentic kinda way. I know nothing about them. These people have neglected me for over 10 years. And now im expect to come into a strange world and act like i love them and everything is great? It's so confusing.   Anyways...kaela sent me an email today and i was sooo excited! haha shes my best friend in the whole wide world and i miss her sooo much! this is truly a test of our friendship. We've been through so much. We go to different schools, we live on different sides of town...we have different friends. I was sooo glad to hear from her.

      okay...so today has been...very exciting. my mom called at like 7am and woke me up, i talked to her, but i barely remember cuz i fell back asleep. lol i'll call her back tonite. Aaron and i stayed up until like 3:30 am my time and 4am his talking. Then we talked this morning, actually, we're talking right now. My dads neighbor, Peggy, who is like maybe 60 or 70ish called and asked me if i wanted to go watch her senior citizen linedance class. I of course said sure, and thanked her for thinking of me. I mean...she did think of me, and how i was here all by myself and i couldnt make an excuse, because im not like busy or anything. And i can always go to the pool, even though i was gonna go swim. So...im just about to leave for a senior citizen line dancing class at the senior community center. wow...lol she made sure i told my dad i would be safe and its just a bunch of senior citizens so they dont do anything too wild...sounds like sooo much fun. naw, it will be nice to get outta the house. then when dad gets off work we're gonna go eat chinese and go to walmart and costco and prob. sams club. Fun stuff. Anyways, my senior citizens are calling. *much love*

      Right now im watching Clifford the Big Red Dog with little zackary..fun stuff. :p and i just got back from yelling at my brothers infront of their friends for getting out the rudolph suit and running around the neighborhood...why? cuz its not mine and they got it all dirty and now it has grass stains on the bottom of the feet..ugh just GREAT. anyways..my throat now hurts. i think i screamed loud enough.  Liz got home tonite and i called her and we talked for like an hour and tomorrow we're hanging out and might spend the nite at one of our houses. yays!  Today i went for my surgery Pre-op. funnnn stuff.  I first went to the dr and talked to the PA a little bit who turns out to be my neighbor, and he explained the procedure and all that good stuff. Next stop was the hosptial, i registered in and got my wrist band printed up and ready for me monday morning. Then i went to see the pre-op nurse and she asked me a bunch of ?s and took my blood pressure...gawd it was sky high, im soo stressed out over this. so we laughed about it. Then i went to talk to the dr who is gonna put me to sleep and she was soo nice, i wish she was like my everyday dr. well, she started talking about the IVs and meds and stuff and i went into panic attack mode, i tried so hard to control it, but i started shaking and my blood ran cold and soon shes asking me if im ok and changing the subject...But im told they actually numb ur hand with a "tiny needle" before the IV. great..more needles. I did mangage to hold in my tears until i got in the car and then some came out then they all came out at my grandmas house when she said "gosh julia, u can control that" ..no i cant. Panic attacks cant be controlled or people wouldnt have them!! the drs are well aware of my issues and they were really understanding and will make sure im comfy. I then went and got my meds so i'll have them for monday, i got like a huge bottle of pain killers and a bottle of Perkaset (sp?). good narcotic stuff. lol oh and i also get a morphine pump. stylin there.  I have decided to get my nose pirced..i REALLY want it done. :p yays Anyone wanna watch? im already gonna take kaela and liz. lol pop some pills and go get it done!! :D  Thats basically been my day...I'll update you prob tomorrow..or sunday...but it might be a while next week cuz i'll be in bed and stuff.  *much love and red roses*

      Okay, so the other day i couldnt post because of the storm at my grandmas..and the fact my computer at home is working..so i havent been able to post, but now im at robertas, babysitting, and i decided to catch up. So far this has happened... &nbsp; I came home saturday and mom and john were taking the wallpaper off the walls in the boy's room. mom didnt act too excited to see me..she hasnt seen me in like 2 months, but still, john is like number one in her life. i totally blew up at her cuz i mean, hello..she first told me i could go to the GRAHAM COLTON BAND concert, and thought it was a "wonderful" idea, as im sure you've read many excited posts about it and her reaction..but john said it was up to her if we all went, and u know..she always has to be the mega bitch, and says "i dont think we're gonna do that.." her excuse? "i dont want to make john pay for it" well umm..he'd only have to buy HIS ticket, and yeah, he'd offer to buy urs, i saved up my damn money, but noo..she doeant want him to spend ANY money on ANYTHING i might enjoy. but she doesnt mind if they go shopping or to Hondorus, or even out to some restraunt...wow...anyways, i totally threw a fit and i wasnt even gonna ask about the conecert, but hopefully Lauren and her parents will take us :D so theres still hope..even though i dont have my hopes up, just my fingers crossed. Saturday nite kaela and i went to eat dinner together, TCBY sundaes..yummy!! then we went to walmart and the mall, thats another story in itself, which will be told in a few mins, then we went to zack's house and saw lauren, andrew, and katie..oh and yeah..zack. lol fun stuff. i ended up inviting lauren and katie (haha i started to type zack..) to spend the nite. well i invited lauren, but katie asked if she could come, i dont remember her exact quote, but im sure lauren can tell u. haha They all came over at about 11..and thats another story that will be told sortly. But the point is, when everyone was gone sunday morning, i spent the whole day again by myself..mom and john went for a ride in the convertiable on the parkway...leaving me all alone in my house cuz the boys were off playing at a friends house and whatever they do. so once again, a day of my summer is spent completely alone. when i brought it up to my mom she said "oh i didnt know that would make u so upset" no, u just didnt care. So, while im yappin about my mom, today we totally get into another fight. i wanted to go bra shopping and get some jeans and i asked while we were in the car after dropping glenn off at a friends, and she said "i wanna go home" so..we went home..and i was like "oo werent we gonna take grandma to the flower place?" and she said "yeah, later.." so then im driving along and asked one more time.."well, can we stop at the mall later?" and she finally says is "i have lunch plans" okay..lunch plans with john..yeah...always something. so then im like "what about tonite?" ..."we're going to dinner tonite.." and i have to babysit because roberta is also going out. dont get me wrong, i love babysitting and getting extra cash, but i also like going to the mall and actually getting outta tha house, without people outside my family..friends of mine are like family, so they dont count. but u know..neighbors shouldnt have to be apart of my everyday breathing life. but who cares..im using his computer right now lol BUT my mom did mangage to tell me i was going to go live with my dad and to call him up..i told her he was at work and stormed outta the room, well, im not going to live with my dad, do u know how many times shes used that one? anyways, she told me i was a bitch and jealous of her having a boyfriend, u know the same old shit she always says. and how shes done her job, which includes "providing you with a home and food" well, my responce was "wow mom, i thought love and caring weren't in the job discribition and u just proved me right" so since her kids can now walk and talk she doesnt have to do anything at all..great mom right there. dammit, shes the biggest bitch ive ever met. And she wonders why i act mad at her..hmm *read everything in this blog and maybe u'll find the answer* &nbsp; Now, back to kaela, lauren and katie. they spent the nite and we had a great time. kaela was kinda pissed at me at first cuz i invited them over and before we went to zacks we went to her bfs house..she ALWAYS sees her bf, she was like more excited to see him than go to the mall with me. whats new? so anyways, after i sat around in his living room for like 45mins watching COPS on tv i finally said KAELA LETS GOOOOOO she got all pissed off and was like FINE! so we went to zacks..and according to kaela "inviting lauren and katie..julia..come on, u were about to die at justins and we werent there long, now i have to see ur friends all nite" THERES A DIFFERENCE IN SEEING MY FRIENDS AND UR BF. i told her she sees justin all the time, and i havent gotten to see lauren or katie at all. well..she said it was the same thing. hmm i dont think so. its my damn house, i'd invite the damn pope over if i wanted and paint his nails black. anyways, she shut up after she smoked a few cigarettes, which by the way according to her are "so stupid, julia if u smoke or drink..i swear..." and she was eyeing the vodka all nite and smokin. umm u damn hypocrit! anyways &nbsp; We went to walmart before all of that, and we dressed up in this police oufit, with the huge dark sunglasses, handcuffs on our jeans, hats, nite sticks, whistle, and play gun (we left in the car). we ran around yelling RIOT CONTROL!! yup.."u make em, we break em" and we went up to strangers and asked them to break up their riots before we had to interfere. lol it was soo funny. then we went to the mall, where i attempted to arrest the security guard and we handcuffed someone to those things they pull down over the store entrance when they close..it was fun. lol we looked cool. lmao! &nbsp; Hmm...anything else i need to talk about? let me think...oh yeah &nbsp; At zacks house he did our tarrot card readings...one of mine was like "ur nieve, childish, and pretending to be someone your not"...well...im sure uve read the post about me being a "poser". whatever, i have tried to be a lil more mature and try to be "myself" or what kaela and ashley think is "myself" but that doesnt make any sense..how can&nbsp;u PRETEND to be URSELF? hmm oh and my love reading told me i was on a manhunt, and the "romeo guy" im looking for "aka mr. perfect" aka..danny...aka the list...isnt gonna work out cuz he does something de-seat-ful(sp?) and i break it off or something..i dunno i forgot that part, but then in the end i do find the mr perfect im looking for. yays. but dammit, i hope someone else comes around that is my mr perfect and knocks danny outta that spot, so i can like be with danny...lol cuz he seems cool. anyways...yeah...so once again, tarrot cards are true. i wish i had remembered what mine said back in 8th grade when zack did them.  &nbsp; Sarah called me the other nite and we talked about funny stuff..and how yea, lauren is gonna hafta to come to her house with me. we're gonna hang with jordan (girl), andrew, clement, gary and sarah..and prob jordans bf devin. but hey..they ALL might spend the nite with sarah..never spent the nite with a dude before..esp messed up ones LMAO. yays lauren! haha &nbsp; I think ive covered it all..and if anything excited has happened that i left out, im sure i called u lauren and told u...so tuff stuff random readers :p &nbsp; *much love and magic beans* &nbsp; ps: im cool cuz i like to wear spiderman bandaids for the hell of it :D

      Tonite dad and i went to church in nashville to see some concert, some kids from Norway were singing. Remember me telling about the dude who used to sit behind me in church and i'd turn around all the time and look at him?? haha well..he hasnt been in church for like weeks, so i was all bummed that i wouldnt get my final last look, but he was there tonite. i figured out he has been workin in the control room, therefore not sitting behind me. Well, the control room is in the balcony of the church and thats where dad and i sat...so i see him and im like :o omg! haha so im totally checkin him out and hes lookin soo hot in a black Fender shirt and jeans..and brown flip flops..so i say OMG DAD! THATS "HIM"!! and dad wanted to see him, so we both leaned forward to lookin into the control room window..and just as we lean forward he turns and sees us! hahaha i jumped back and looked the other way, but dad cracked up and was like omg julia..hahahahah HAHAHAHA u just got caught! so..i had to live with him catching me for literally the hundredth time..lol so..hes hot..haha do u blame me? no and im never gonna see him again! haha i should have talked to him..dammit! anyways..on the way home i saw a sign that said "davey crockett" so i started singing "here comes davey crockett comin down mt. trail!!" and my dad was like--umm julia, thats peter cotton tail...OOPs my bad. sorry, am i suppose to know the damn D.C song? didnt think so... &nbsp; its now 12:04 here...1:04 back home, and i still havent packed my shit up. oh well.. i gotta get up at 5:30...and leave by 7am...fun stuff! im soo excited though! i do really need to pack..ive been saying that all day though. &nbsp; Kaela is prob gonna spend the nite and we're going to a baseball game and we might stop by zack's and say hey to everyone..i really want a cigarette, but i know kaela would kill me if she knew i was smoking. okay, once she was like "oo julia, i wanna try a cig, can i have one?" so i stole some and we smoked..then i started smoking with friends and she got all mad..well fuck that. lol i happen to like to smoke, but i just dont have any cigs..katie told me zack bought some at a little country store by sweet talking the lady about how he was really 18 but left his id at home and put on an accent..hahaha thats funny, now i have someone to buy me cigs. haha now i really will turn into a smoker.  &nbsp; Lauren..heres an offer u cant pass up...u, me at sarah sampson's house..guys...alcohol, cigs, and pot if u want LMAO baby..omg its all right there in front of us..we just gotta grab it like morons. ..so maybe thats not the smartest thing to write about on my blog..but u know, its the truth..im a curious lil beeyatch and...yea...lol so lauren, u game? i dont wanna take katie, 1) i know she wont go, she'll just pretend like she is and 2) tha guys will all like her....hell, they'll prob like u. but the only thing about these guys...they want some, even if its just makingout..so be prepared to prob hook up with someone...but then again, u never know, sarah hasnt hooked up with anyone in a while at her house.&nbsp; i just asked jordan childress if he wanted to go with me..cuz we never spend any time together and hes into all of that..he told me "sorry i gotta work bud". shit..i rather have lauren anyways! lol i love ya lauren! :D  &nbsp; Okay..im done looking like a totally dumbass idiot on my own fuckin blog now.. &nbsp; *much love and MAYBERRY here i come!*

      Okay, i had a dream last nite that was the usual julia dream...makingout with hot guys. dammit i swear, in EVERY dream i have im kissing some guy..thats weird. i dont even kiss that many guys in real life! dammit. but anyways, my dream.  &nbsp; I'm at this concert type thing, its a dark buliding with like multicolored stage lights and black lights and has the glow under black light writting on the walls. Pink, white and yellow writting. I spotted these 2 good looking guys sitting at a table (this is in the end of the dream, i forgot what happened before all of this..) but i go up to them and take my guitar and ask them to tune it. They are both skater types. The cutest one says sure and starts to tune, as he's strumming the strings the 2nd one starts to really wiggle and is way outta tune, its too loose, so i kinda laughed and said "yeah i tried to tune it but gave up..as u can tell" he fixed it and said no problem, while hes tuning my guitar im talking to his friend and we go over and sit to watch whatever we were suppose to be watching. I then walk off to talk to my mom and she tells me it's time to go. I walk straight back over to the guy sitting down, hop in his lap, and totally start makingout with him while my mom is standing there waiting for me to go. lol Then i go over to skater boy and get my guitar and then totally kiss him as well. dammit..i think im a lil too forward.  &nbsp; YAY that was my pathetic dream..yup yup.. &nbsp; Lorne just called me baby and asked me if i was talking to anyone (as in guys)...im gonna throw up. LMAO &nbsp; I also just got off the phone with Kaela and shes excited that i'll be home tomorrow....this is my last nite in TN!!! i swear, im sooo excited to go home and now im craving those chicken wings in the fridge..yum... &nbsp; Anyways.... &nbsp; *much love and chicken wings* &nbsp;

      YAY! i get to write..finally...the lil tool bar seems weird..hmm..i dunno. anyways..heres how my last few days have gone:  &nbsp;  I went to carolines. i was doubtful, but omg was i wrong!! WE HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME!! OMG!! she's like the sweetest girl! and we had fun staying up until 3am eating lucky charms and talking online to my friends who she thinks are hot..haha yeah so do i C. We did a lot of fun things like umm..we went to Alabama shopping! OMG thats a story...so we're in Alabama in this huge mall, not the largest in this city (Huntsville) but one of the largest, bigger than Hanes mall. Anyways, so we're shopping in AE and Aero. , and omg my aunt gale totally went all out and bought me like EVERYTHING i wanted..yay. lol i got some pants and shirts. then we went to Aero. and got some more stuff. fun times there. We were headed to Dillards to look at some shoes for Kayre and theres this huge storm outside and all the sudden they call torando! hahaha omg, this place is known for its torandos. so...we all had to go to the bottom level of Dillards at the makeup counter cuz its the "safe loction" of the mall. haha We stood there for like 35-40mins until the torando went away. haha i also took a pic of us standing in Dillards. i now have a pic and i can say "this is me shopping in Alabama during a torando" haha yay! We had a great time. Today i actually got to meet some of C's friends. boy do her friends have WEIRD ass names like Alton (not really weird..), Stiles and Battle. Alton is my age and is a skater kid..hes soooo HOT and Stiles is like a normal dark red headed kid who lives up the road from C and Battle is kinda cute...nice name though. and there was this other hot skater named Braiden. ooo lala. he was playing golf in skater clothes LMAO! bam margera shoes too. :p oh and um..we went and met up with them at the country club. we sat with Brittany and Catherine (ugh that name..) as they laid out in the sun by the pool. we just stopped by for a min before C's denist appointment. anyways..it was fun.  &nbsp;  I went and got my pics developed and im tempted to stick my "skater girl" pic up in here..just cuz i think its funny how im standin by a fountain lookin like an idiot..its a stupid pic. the wind was blowing and my hair is EVERYWHERE..but oh well...u know what i just noticed? BLOGGER did change the whole post setup!! OMG im soo smart!! this is cool stuff now..woo hoo! hmm i would put that pic in here..but idk how! so yay..  &nbsp;  Lets see..im excited to go back home in ONE MORE DAY! thank u jesus! Tonite i went and bought another shirt from AE and got some "flavored chicken wings" ive never had those..umm but the Teryiki ones are good. lol and umm..i bought a bag of cherries! yays and some berry mints from AE too, i love their mints! UBER GOOD.  &nbsp;  LALALALA i love skaters!! LALALALA omg, brandon, the boy bailey dumped joe for, and never dated..is HOT! omg..brandon is good lookin. lol looks like a skater but is a prep. best of both worlds. i told joe i thought B was a cutie and he got mad...but i heard he plays that stupid Magic Card game..thats like really gay..my bros used to play it. umm..that doesnt work. i'm still stickin with danny. lol *please o please&nbsp; o please let me get danny*  &nbsp;  Oh and C's friends are all the really pretty voted most popular chicks..they're really nice though, but i guess it's true if ur a cheerleader then that comes with the package, cuz i mean Caroline is really nice and pretty and sweet and outgoing, but doesnt strike me as someone like that...but anyways, rock on! ...gawd did i just judge? i did..shame on me.  &nbsp;  i talked to good old clement today. he asked me when i was gonna get drunk with him and i told him i was comin home early and he was all happy. He still wants katie to come and party with us..umm..no..im like "well i guess u and katie can just party together" and hes like "no u gotta come too" well it sounds to me u lil mother fuckin punk u just want KATIE and dont care if im there or not. fuck that, i hate being used to get to KATIE. and KATIE doesnt even wanna TALK to u..gawd u phreak.  &nbsp;  im really glad im friends with jordan (a friend of sarah sampson) . shes soo nice and like she was tellin me how she only has one girl friend (sarah) cuz she hates "bitches" and she fights all the time, but she really loves and cares about the friends she has..and shes like "u could do anything to me and i wouldnt lay a hand on u! execpt if u fucked my bf..if u or sarah did i'd kill ya" haha shes had a hard life, but shes doin great. already outta school and in college this fall, and shes 16! and doesnt have a baby. shes awesome, i cant wait to hang out with her and sarah! :p even though they will both prob get me in deep shit. lol  &nbsp;  WHY AM I ALWAYS LABELED THE "SWEET ONE" i mean, u ask guys what type of girl i am and its "sweet"...like nathan just said "ur just the girl i need, but wrong type" WTF..type? so i asked him..and im the sweet one, u know how many people have said that?! i dont wanna be SWEET all the time! he wants someone dirty..well hell, i dont know how to be a "dirty type" execpt screw em and im not home! and i wouldnt screw him anyways..  &nbsp;  Thats all the important stuff i can think of right now...  &nbsp;  *much love and get um*

      yeah i wish i had someone to hold tight after driving all freakin night!   Anyways, like i said, i was too lazy to write about everything in my last blog. So i guess now is the time i write about the wedding i went to. i heard "my goodness! you've grown up so much!" and "wow! you've grown up!" WAY too many times. duh people, 10, 11 years makes u grow up. hell, thats from a baby to middle school! But arent you lucky, u saw me as a baby so u just missed from early school years to *gasp* late high school! i be damned!! hell, i grew boobs!!! OMG!! and i got a life! OH MY! and u know what else, i developed my own views and opinions about things--such as you. Doesnt make a damn bit of sense. duh, when you igorne me for several years i of course got older and grew up, without you so i dont know why they all acted like they had something to do with the person i am today. They should have been embarrased. There were all these people who i had no idea who the hell they were. they were coming at me from all angles, all saying "wow uve grown!" or "hows my 14yr old niece?!" umm..im 16 now. *smile* *wants to run away and take the cake with me* *just keeps smiling, saying "well gordon is the 14yr old one, maybe thats why u thought that*. ugh. Anyways, there was one person who i thought made me feel like family. the groom, my cousin Lance. he saw me and smiled and gave me a big hug, no one else had even touched me...and he said "how ya been girl!, it's been ages!" and he told me he was excited i was coming. His new bride, Hailey, hugged me and said "wow, i've heard so much about you! im so glad you could make it!" they were very nice..then i met Hailey's mother off to the side when my dad introduced himself, and then me, and when she heard my name she said "oo ur julia! i've heard some much about you from hailey and lance!"...made me feel good... anyways, to lance and hailey, have fun in jamacia! :p   Speaking of family, my aunt Gale and cousin Kayre or Cayre..or whatever Kay-re want me to come up and spend 3 days and 2 nites with Kayre and her daughter my 2nd cousin Caroline. I'm a year older than Caroline. Shes the only cousin i actually remember as a kid. I've already written about her i think. But surprise surprise! they actually called to make plans for me to come up. i think i wrote that it would be fun, but i wasnt getting my hopes up. for once, they came through. Spending time with Caroline and her brother Evan should be a lot of fun. Me and Caroline can stay up late and talk about boys and that kinda stuff..i hope shes like that. She's all neat and organized and i'm hectic and choatic. hopefull i'll get along with her...i know i will, but i hope i REALLY like her and i dont have to put on a fake smile and laugh. and god help me if she listens to suckass music.  I called my mom this morning and told her i was calling again to say hey cuz she was mean to me last nite. lol she just laughed. she was totally different. i swear, shes crazy. lol I asked her about the concert yet again, she wants me to get home and sit down with her and john and talk about. i quote.."im all for it julia, but u need to make sure john is" OMG SO IT ALL COMES DOWN TO WHAT JOHN SAYS i know he wont say no..hell, hes smarter than that. doesnt want me to be all pissed off at him! haha so..in other words, im going to my freakin concert. lol i better be at least...im not gonna give a def. yay or nay, but between me and my lil blog, YAY im going! lol Mom also said she was planning a white water rafting trip for when i got home (with john and his family) but then glenn didnt wanna go U DAMN BRAT and then she thought it would be too much for my knee MY FUCKIN KNEE and ive ALWAYS wanted to go rafting, but she said with all the rocks and rough water..it wouldnt be smart for my knee. SO HER, JOHN AND ROBERTA MAY STILL GO. HOW FAIR IS THAT?! HELLLLL NO. but so all of us can do something, we're going to Carowinds when i get home. okay..now carowins..white water rafting trip..carowinds...white water rafting trip..carowinds...HELL I SAY WHITE WATER RAFTING DAMMIT. but nooo julia has to go to carowinds. am i complaing? no. i mean, i like going to carowinds and john does rollercoasters, so that means mom will get on them and i used to not be able to get her on any of them. she would soo piss me off but i guess now since john is getting on them...she will do. i almost asked if i could take a friend and then take kaela with me, but i figured she wanted it to be a "family" thing. i said at least i get to ride the kickass lil yellow kiddy taxi ride cuz u can only get on it if ur like 4 feet tall or with a lil kid. and im sure i'll grab zack..hahaha but who will be with zack when we all go on rollercoasters? umm i guess roberta can sit that one out hahaha naw, she'll prob throw a fit and glenn or gordon will be the babysitter. lol I'll prob do all the coasters, i just hate the old wooden one Thunder Road and i def. wont do it backwards! thats crazy shit...i dont like it cuz when it goes down that big drop i feel like im gonna fall out. i want to be tightly secured in that seat like the newer ones where u have the harness over you, i dont want a lil bar...it freaks the hell outta me lol now, maybe if i had some hot dude..hahaha mom then asked me if i could walk carowinds and i said umm yeah, i walk malls. lol and then told her she did it with her hip before she got it replaced and she was like "yeah ur right.." so i'll be walking carowinds and ridding rides! yay. and not white water rafting...but i'll get to go to my concert! haha  I have decided that if anything goes fucky with my knee i'll get one of those kickass hover crafts!! u know those scooter thingies..im tryin to remember their exact name lol oh well, they're kickass!! i'll get to be in a commerical where i go to the grand canyon and be like "I LOVE MY NEW HOVER CRAFT! IT GOT ME TO THE GRAND CANYON!--CANYON---CANYON-- hahaha love it. but i'll be on there since im young and be like in California with the hippies gettin high "I JUVE LOVE MY NEW KICKASS HOVER CRAFT! IT LET ME GO TO CALI AND HAVE RANDOM STONED SEX!" hahaha   I have this friend Neil who goes to umm..uh..omg he might go to carol county, thats danny's school! omg why didnt i connect those 2 things! neil lives in cana too!

Today i went to church for the last time in tenn. yays. my hottie wasnt sitting beside me..dammit. lol then i changed into my pink and black converses and wanted skater shirt and kept the black skirt w/pink dots on..i looked like some skater chick. i then went out to pick up skaters. lol  I just got off the phone with mom and she fuckin pissed me off. she was talking to me and my grandparents and john were sitting there waiting for her to get off the phone. i asked her about the concert and she TOTALLY played stupid in front of them and said how she forgot and i said "well u do know im missing the one here to come home" and shes like "We'll talk about it, but i cant compromise over a concert" WTF DOES THAT MEAN?! hello. she fuckin pissed me off. she NEVER tells me yes in front of other fucking people and when she goes say yes she acts like i forced her too. well im not compromising with this damn concert either bitch.   Anyways..many exciting things happened today, but im just too damn lazy to type it all...oh and i hung out at some rock stars house LMAO hes on tour with Josh Rouse in Europe, his name is Curt Pirkens. He was in some band called Stella for a long time and then went solo. His cd was number 1 in europe for like 3 months straight. yay curt. i hung out with his cat and listened to his cds...his dad and my dad are good friends...that would explain why i was in his house haha.   *much love and fondu*

      I went to the wedding today. The first wedding i've ever been to in my 16 1/2 years of breathing. yays. It was no big deal and didnt make me wanna cry...everyone was like "awww julia! uve grown up so much!!" and im thinking "yeah beyatches, u havent seen me since i was 5 or 6 years old!" OF COURSE IVE GROWN UP!! IM FREAKIN 16!! I GREW TALLER AND GOT MY OWN LIFE AND DEVELOPED MY OWN THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS AND I GOT A LIFE!! AND GUESS WHAT..I GOT BOOBS! dumbasses. anyways, the only person who made me feel HALF happy was the groom, my cousin Lance. He actually acted excited to see me. He smiled and hugged me and his now wife was like "ive heard soo much about u julia! im so happy to meet u" she made me feel wanted outta the whole damn bunch. then her mother was like "ooo its julia!! ive heard soo much about you from lance!"...i guess lance talked about me. i dont even remember the dude...but im glad he stood there with open arms. made me feel like family. everything about the wedding was nice...made me think about my wedding one day. ive decided i want a live band, not a sound system.   My cousin Caroline, the only one besides Grant i remember(Grant didnt make it to the wedding, but hes my age and caroline is a year younger), but she wants to spend a few days together before i leave. well thats gotta be this week and i really dont think my aunt and cousin (caroline's mom) will come through with driving the 1 1/2 hours to get me to spend the nite with caroline. i hope they do..it would be fun..but ive gotten my hopes up about a lot of things. Caroline is a softball player and cheerleader...she doesnt strike me as a cheerleader and if u saw her you wouldnt think so either.   *much love and altoids*  IM COMING HOME IN 6 DAYS!! HELLS YEA!! AND LAURENS BACK FROM THE BEACH! YAYS!

      Today was not very intresting...lets see...i went to his uncle dave macon days or some shit like that. its stupid ass hell. its like cloggers and shit. think autumn leaves gone to hell but not that many people. i cant still believe lil mt airy brings in that many people for stupid autumn leaves. anyways...i hunted and hunted for a freakin candy apple and no one had any. dammit. so i settled for a cherry limeaide, didnt beat sonic's.   tomorrow is the wedding. am i looking forward to it? no. why not? because even though my dad says everyone is soo excited to see me, i dont believe it. remember kaye, my cousin and how cool she was? well she told me she'd pick me up the week after our shopping trip and we'd go see a chick flick. did she ever call? no she didnt..i actually thought she would. but hey, ive been ignored for 10+ years,why start paying attention to me now? that sounds depressing as hell, but trust me, im not crying over it.   I cant find a song that i really wanna listen to. i put in cd after cd and try to think up of songs to download and cds to make, but i cant...nothing sounds good to me right this minute. dammit i hate that.  a week until i come home!! yays!!   i want a punk rocker boyfriend...a dude in a band with messy hair and a lip ring. hells yea. but i dont know anyone like that...people in mt airy are too..umm..idk...not unique. i guess skaters will have to do cuz those are the grungiest people in mayberry. maybe lauren will find me a good un at NCSSM. :d right L? yup.   rock on  *much love and butterflies*  CH-CH-CHECK IT OUT: www.purevolume.com/ashwin and www.purevolume.com/madison ...i want those kinda rockers...:( oh and props to this other kids blog who i saw and inspired me to look up those kids, which are his friends..lucky bitch. http://acidskater.blogspot.com  (click on his "myspace" link and check out his friend Lee..omg hottness totally all tha way-hes in ashwin) they're music kicks ass, i couldnt get into madison as well as i could ashwin, but hey, they're hot and thats a p-p-plus.

      dammit..i stayed up until past 4am with all of that shit going on last nite. i stayed up and talked to mikel, of all people. he even agreed that ashley and kaela were being a little harsh and mean to me, he made the point they wanted to make tearless in under 10 fucking minutes. i swear, no one should treat anyone the way they treated me last night. thats just fucked up. okay..so maybe sometimes i try to hard for people to like me, but thats just cuz i care and i dont like it when people totally hate my guts. why should i give anyone a reason to hate me? damn. whats wrong with that? oh and yeah, guys..i try too hard to be their perfect person...yeah sometimes i'll stick their fave bands at the top of my list too, i mean, i really do like those bands, but they may not be my FAVE also...sometimes i move that #10 band up to #3...gawd, i could be fucking them to get them to like me and they throw a "OMG UR SUCH A POSER/MORON/LIAR" fit...i didnt deserve that. kaela told me the only reason i gauged my ears a while back was cuz shes sure some dude had it done..umm no. the reason i guaged my ears is cuz i asked my mom if i could and she said "no". thats why. but wait, i must be posing as a rebel. now im copying a smartass!! omg when will this end?! i bet im burning in hell for it all!! *all said sarcastically* then they bust me on madison..wtf...what i do in my own damn time is my business. dammit. So...for the first time in years...my friends have made me absoulutly lose control of my emotions and cry and cry and feel like the world was crashing down on my "poser" ass. Oh and i got spat on for smoking a cigarette and drinking. wow...how can they talk to me like that? esp kaela?! shes not only hooked up with randon boys and smoked and drank (both with me) and smack on me about me doing the same?! WTF. Ashley, shes catholic, i can see why she would disagree, but dont sit around saying "omg ur my fucking idol julia" if u disagree lil fuckers. like ive said before.."YOU GIVE ME AN AUDIENCE AND I'LL PREFORM SOME MORE" i think thats my best damn quote. I dont think smoking an occasionaly cigarette and drinking the occasional drink is so fucking bad. and i know that ive said things like how i wanna go makeout with the kid with the tounge ring..yeah well..i still do. :p haha at least im not fucking him. things could be so much worse, and they dont see that. im exactly 16 1/2 haha wow im smart, and i think i can make my own decisions and live with them. i mean...what 16yr old doesnt wanna have fun? obviously ashley..and kaela only wants to have fun if its her and with her boyfriend. fuck that. whether hes my bf or not, who i kiss and do stuff with is up to me. fuck, its not like i sleep with every guy who comes up..hell, i dont even makeout with every dude that comes at me. why do they do this to me?! well, last nite josiah and bailey told me that it was all fucked up and they think im great and wouldnt have me any other way...they made me feel good. so lauren, when u read this..tell me what u think about it all...  i called my bro and got my classes this morning (after he informed me he didnt hook up at church camp, just made a really good friend--i told him not to hook up at church camp, even though its like the best place..but hey, jesus is def. watching then) and they arent fucked up like everyone elses!   Hon Eng 3- Carson Comp. App- Bailey Ap Bio- Bodnar Hon.Spanish 3- Castillo  Hon. Pre Cal- Gammons Hon. U.S. His.-Mayo Ap Bio.2- Bodnar Honors Thea. Arts- Diamont   i guess thats pretty fair..execpt all my damn classes are either AP or Honors. and i have none with catherine. muhahahaha  oh and thinkin about her, did u know ashley told me i should "stand up for myself" and tell catherine i dont like her instead of grining and pretending to be nice? WTF..hello, shes weird, her mother would be calling mine and we're 16.   *much love and war and peace*

      ashley and kaela just ganged up on me and said i wasnt true to myself and i wasnt myself and how i change to make people like and how im a poser..all in a nutshell. yeah i know how ive said i played up things i did really like to people who i knew liked them and ive said i wanted dannys cousin to like me..but its not that bad. they were saying i was fake with lauren and katie and everyone..just a bunch of bullshit. and asking me which face i used for them. what the fuck. i dont even wanna talk about it. ive been crying now for 3hrs all while being slapped in the face with the word FAKE. joe and bay disagree even lorne does..hell and i thought he hated me. they told me i was an all around kickass chick who no one should hate, cuz i dont give people a reason to hate me..but i guess my own damn friends have thought one up..arent they smart?   *much love and complete fakeness*

I went to Dillards to help dad pick out a tie and then to Walmart where i bought some more blank cds to make more illegal cds out of! yay for me. And then...we went to Diary Queen. i got a small cherry sundae and before i could eve pick it up off the counter i got it everywhere..and i mean everywhere, see the chick that made it overfilled the damn thing, so this red cherry shit was running everywhere and this dude was the one up front that we paid and hes like laughin at me cuz im tryin to clean it up and make it stop. lol not fun..i was like "ughhh" and laughin at myself and he just stood there watching laughin at me. thanks a lot dude, i should have just poured it out on the counter and let ur minium wage ass clean it up. but i tried my best to make as little as a mess as possiable but u must have found it freakin funny. ugh. lol ok...anyways, im offically coming home july 17th. i told my dad. i did make up another story though about how i needed to get my stuff for school together during that week since i wont be able to the next week because the dr will make me stay off my knee before surgery..well, he thinks my pre-op is monday, its really friday as we all know. ok..so i lied..i lied cuz i didnt wanna hurt his feelings and i NEED to go home and get my stuff for school ready (no lie) and see my friends because if i wait another week they'll all be gone to the bahamas (no lie) and i need to get my GCB/OAR tickets (totally not a lie), and i need to get wasted and hang out with people who i have no idea who the fuck they are! which is totally fun.

Dannys cousin just got on and i was like "omg omg omg do i talk to her?! omg omg omg what do i say?! omg..what if i say the wrong thing?!" so i told myself to shut up and said "hey" to her she instantly knew my name and heard all about me..whew...and we're now talking. All she tells me about is danny this danny that...dream come true right? no i dont want her to feel like im being buddy buddy with her cuz of danny. WELL, i did find out dannys birthday, may 30th, the day after i left for tenn. haha brianna told me that one. wow..for meeting this chick just now im pretty comfy talking to her..hmm thats good. she'll tell danny im awesome LMAO. She surfs..wow how kickass is that? and she wants to learn how to play the drums. Now we're talking about music..yay...i did something bad, when she asked me my fave bands i picked out the bands i do really like, but that were also dannys faves LMAO is that bad?! WELL...she asked me if i was doing anything this friday nite and i told her i was outta town and when i was coming back. lol Apparently, she wants me and danny to hook up too..dammit, im one of the most self concious people in this WORLD. like, its a never ending battle. and to think they are hyping danny up to meet me and all this pressure is on me to meet him, and YES! i really wanna meet him..but bailey is always like "omg hes soo hot, like he walks by and im like :o " well..REALLY hoy guys date REALLY hot girls like im sure ive said before, but im not REALLY hot..or even the slightest bit hot..so why would i wanna meet danny when i know we're not gonna be anything? its like getting ur hopes up. If you dont expect the world, then you'll never be crushed. Okay, i just turned a blog from everyone being able to see what a hopeless romantic dork i am, into a depressing pitty party...  *much love and parties*

Its either listenin to music or surfin www.purevolume.com and listening to music. some of those bands are KICKASS but others im like..umm dude, theres a reason why ur band hasnt left purevolume's site...Limbeck is freakin awesome, i love those guys! they're on purevolume, but they left (knew they would!) and everyone should go out and buy their cd. Their single JULIA is so about me..execpt my intials arent JRC..lol To listen to their whole cd go to www.hieverythingsgreat.com Right now im listening to Howie Day. I looked him up cuz hes gonna be playing with GCB and OAR in Cary, NC at that concert. :D He's good actually, plays guitar and sings. I like his stuff. might hafta buy that cd from him. lol I love listenin to people ive never heard of. puts some fun into listenin to music.   That dude who wants to fuck me from central, well him and his gf are back together. and well im sooo glad cuz u know, i have no intrest in him what so ever besides being a buddy and well he turned on him cam today when him and gf were at his house and shes talkin to me online and shes pretty..in a skanky kinda way. sorry, did she walk outta tha 80's with that neon blue eyeshadow shit? umm...should be shot on tha spot. anyways, they looked happy together and thats all that matters u know. well all the sudden she starts tellin nathan she wants to meet me. HELLO! i dont meet guys gf's. esp if that guy has told me he wants to fuck me for weeks at a time. HELLO are u insane?! why would he want me to meet his gf anyways?! thats fucked up. I'm looking forward to coming home, buying my concert tickets, and getting completely wasted. sounds like fun. sounds like now i'll have 2 weeks to make my summer fulfilled before im in the freakin bed with a fucked up knee. anyways...lauren, that means when i get home u'll be home!! YAY!!!! now im excited. OMG and that means u and me at sarah sampsons house with a bunch of strange dudes and alcohol!! lmao. sounds..intresting..I keep u safe!! i can kickass..."ok lauren, on the count of 3 i'll throw a punch and u start running and i'll follow!" haha  I'm waiting for good old joe to get online so i can hear about danny...haha im starting to scare myself. is it wrong to be buddy buddy with his cousin and her not know ur intrested or even know about her cousin...so she'll put a good word in for u when ur name comes up? naw, didnt think so...haha dude if im cool with danny's cousin (they're close) then hmm...i should be cool with some of her family. aka danny. dude if a guy ever did that to me id be scared of him...LMAO. oh well fuck it. im tired of not getting what i freakin want.   *much love and random caos*

      okay..im having 2nd..3rd..4th thoughts about coming home early..part of me wants to come home ASAP cuz i miss my friends and i wanna make sure i have those Graham Colton tickets in my lil hand...then the other part of me was broken hearted when i mentioned to my dad that "mom said i might wanna come home a week early so i can rest up before my dr's appt"..i lied..but oh well. it was to save him heartache. he then asked me if i was home sick..im not really home sick, just sick of being away from home. i said no. so in a few days i guess i'll tell him i do want to come home july 17th because i want to spend time with my friends and they're leaving when i get home and wont be back until i have my surgery, and then i cant leave the house. But he gave me the line "u can rest here just as easily as u can rest back in NC" yeah i know..but its not the same. i gotta stand my ground on this one, even if Everclear would be kickass to see in concert and have pics of..but it doesnt matter..graham colton is just a state away.   -til next time  *much love and chuck taylors*  oh p.s: i added dannys cousin to my messanger list, but im not going to mention danny i dont think. well..i havent decided..she knows bay talks to me about danny but doesnt know why. i might just laugh and say "yeah well i was tellin her my list for the perfect bf one time and i gave him a car and a name and everything and it was basically danny." hahaha giggle giggle act all sweet towards his cousin. Dude i gotta be nice to this chick and make her like me...lol am i a hard person to like? yeah..she'd go back and tell danny either "yea man shes cool as fuck" or "fuck that crazy ass bitch" and i dont wanna come off as though im just talking to her to get to danny u know..so thats why i dont know if i wanna talk about danny right away. Turn into her best friend, then move in on her cousin...sounds like a plan. muhaha

Alrighty, im done here...im sittin here naked in a towel!! can i getta "whoop whoop"?! things are great..bay is telling one of her friends to pretend she knows me..and talk to danny..hello, thats weird. dont pretend u know me and say a bunch of lies about me to a guy...hes gonna see right through that. "yea julia has pretty brown hair!" danny: "oh, i thought she was blonde".."oh yeah! thats what i meant..shes blonde!" fuck. my life is going down a waterslide and hitting the sides on the way down. hope i dont crack a rib.  *much love and rubber stamps*

      I just got off the phone with my mom and we talked for like 30-40mins. We talked about mainly Roberta and how shes like my psyco cousin brooke. Thats another story by the way. We talked about the O.A.R/Graham Colton Band/Howie Day concert and how it sounded like fun and even if the price i told her was about $10 too less for tickets, she still thinks it sounds like "a lot of fun". She said she would mention it to john, and how she's sure he will agree, considering hes wrapped around her finger. I told her about my outfit for the wedding this weekend and how i picked it out because i could care less what my dad's family thinks of me...its..hmm...unique. hahaha i asked to wear my converses with it, but got a no go on that. She told me that if i wanted to come home a week early it would be ok...what shes trying to say it "julia, i miss you and want you home" aww how touching. actually, i would like to really go home, but the thing is, if i leave next weekend, i'll miss my Everclear concert..so right now, im weighing the 2 options...idk what to do. i really wanna go to this concert cuz it would be cool to see them preform, but then again...they're not my FAVE band...and i couldnt be crushed if i missed it...but..i do think it would be cool to go...but then again, i have to make sure mom orders our tickets for the other concert..and if im not home i know she'll be clueless on what to do. and if i come home, she'll DEF take me cuz "i missed a concer to come home early thinking i could get to go to one in aug!" lol oh and she went and bought me a facial at the European Day Spa, so when i get home i get to go get a facial, which ive always wanted, because they clean out your pores and stuff. yays. Now, im thinking about going home. i dont know what to do. I figured i'd mention to my dad "hey i talked to mom today and she mentioned she thought i should come home a week early to get ready for my dr. appointment" my dr. appt. is aug.30th. haha i would have to come home july 17th, to prepare for my aug. 30th appt. wow. I want to come home and see my friends and have 2 weeks of real summer before i have my surgery. I dont know what to do...  now im listening to this 30mins 18 second radio show about "how to not get a speeding ticket" and this dude is callin in giving advice, saying the cops pull over on "sweet cameros" lol this is funny shit. everyone should hear it. how did he talk his way outta a ticket? cuz "ur picking on me cuz my car goes 85..and i pay ur salaries" hahahaha this is funny. http://media.ebaumsworld.com/index.php?e=iroc-speeding.mp3   yeah i agree with the guy, why dont cops go bust out rapiest, gang bangers, and burgulars instead sweet rides. lmao oh and speed raidars bounce off of a clean shiny car...lmao funny shit.  I have just destroyed one of my fave guitar picks. but i have 11 more like it. I started chewing on it, and totally cracked it and made all the color come off, and now it's in 4 pieces. I hate the thin picks. lol they chew up easily. fuck it.   *much love and palm trees*

      Just read lauren's blog. Sounds exciting!! i wouldn't have hung out with mayberry though..i cant stand her! But then again, if you're looking for someone to  hang out..haha Too bad evan (yes yes hot hot hot hot hot ass homemade fucker wucker--and to think we used to be like like tight with that boy! until dumbass katie..) wasnt there. lol Glad to hear you and hollis had a great time. :D oh and i bet that band was kick ass!  *on the phone with momma*  YES YES YES YES!! if only i could do my victory dance!! I told mom my idea about the concert...and...she didnt say no!!!! she said "i will think about it" and i said "yeah it would be nice..since ive been in isolation all summer.." and she AGREED! omg, did my mother just agree with me about going to a concert?! HELLS YEA. she said we'd talk about it when she's more awake. She's been up for a long time, she got back home at about 6 i take it this morning and hasn't gotten to sleep yet, its now like 11:20 there. YES!! fingers are crossed for the concert..fingers crossed! I gave her the sad story about me missing it in nashville because its the day im coming home..and then i told her how i looked to see if they would be in NC...and they were!! i be damned! and then how WOW $19.50!!! and then WOW!! tables and chairs away from the crowd for mom and her bf!! and then WOW!!! i'd fill ur tank up with gas to contribute to the drive! hahahahaha im so full of shit.   ANYWAYS!! THIS IS A GOOD THING!!! now lauren, work on ur rents.   I was reading laurens blog, like i said earlier, and she commented on my song. wow, i had no idea i would get that reaction outta her. I have no idea what reaction i was going for. it was actually going to be kept to myself..but i decided i wanted to post it, and i felt like sharing it with a few friends. Right now im working on music for it and then i might try singing it, but lauren is prob my top choice to sing it! haha She'd put a lot of heart into it. I tend to write songs as my way of dealing with things, and they usually don't leave my notebook. This one did. I guess i was hoping it would make an impact on someone, and i guess it did. Maybe i was just looking for the basic "thats good julia" comment everyone looks for when they show someone a work of art. Something to make you smile and think "maybe i need to do another...". Thanks lauren, u made me feel really good about it. You'll prob be the next topic with you moving away and all..hmmm..maybe a song just for you. :D haha Lauren, you are good at something! You're very talented. You sing, and i think you sing wonderfully! I've seen you in plays! You're wonderful. You're appreciation for musicals and talent is hard to find in someone our age, and i think one day u'll def. find that one thing or do something so spectacular with your life. Dont worry babes. check lauren out at http://thesupposedgoldenpath.blogspot.com :p shes kick major ass ass (as she would say)   I woke dad up at 1am this morning...because i was on the phone. I had been on the phone since 8pm...hahahaha omg what a long ass time to be on the phone with someone! 5 fuckin hours!! OMG! well..we talked for like 2 hours by ourselves and then 3 wayed someone..so i talked to 2 people...it was a very intresting conversation! to make it even weirder, we all 3 were on the computer playing Doodle on yahoo messanger...hahaha I was talking to kristen and nathan. and to think i really dont like kristen...haha weirdness.   Nathan told me i had a sexy lil voice. hes the 3rd guy who has said that. lmao how can someones voice be sexy on the phone?! i mean, i think it when guys have great voices..but me?! He was funny. when he got me off the phone he told me hearing my voice made him wanna fuck me even more. Ive talked to him on the phone before!! ive known the kid for a few years! But the first time i talked to him on the phone was with kristen on the line too and they were dating..so therefore he prob didnt care about my voice. hahaha He told me he would really "love to hang out" with me sometime. yeah...if i really want attention...hahaha. When i called my mom the first time this morning no one answered because she was at grandmas so i left a message..and listened to myself on the answering machine...lmao. i dont find my voice sexy. hahaha i think i sound like a little girl. hahaha  oo maybe i should talk to danny on the phone...hahahhahaha  until next time --- ooh and everyone needs to check out the band Wheat. i recommend them highly. They sing a song called "met a girl" on shrek 2, but all their stuff is good. "All these things" is greatness...  *much love and DUDE i just realized something! sales tax is 9.75% percert here! back home its a freakin 7%!!!!!! or 7.5--i cant remember..DAMN (9.75% is written above the hot dudes name that helped me at hot topic)

      ROCK STAR!!!!! enough said.  My new fave store is HOT TOPIC i love that store!! i went in there to look at some more shoes. there was this HOT guy workin in there as usual, so i got him to help me. he was my shoe slave. muahahaha. he was soo cute, his name was matt. he was quiet and kinda shy which sucked. but we did laugh and talk a little bit. i tried on 3 diff pairs of shoes and couldnt decided between 2 of them cuz the one i REALLY wanted was too big. He had a little brace on his arm so i asked him how he hurt his arm and he totaled his car haha wow..smart move. i then told him i felt bad cuz i had him lacing all these shoes up with his hurt arm hahaha he smiled and said it was no prob that he didnt mind cuz we were having prob the best conversation hes had at work. awwwwwwwww shucks. lol he was a cutie. X-TREMLY bangable might i add. i finally decided on black and pink converse high tops and i started rollin the top down and he was like..oo i do that too! lol so we sat around talkin about shoes. lol he told me i was "rockin'" the black and pink high tops vs the black and white chuck taylors. ..so of course..i got his fave. lol He had black hair, it was straight, like he could have done the hot flippy outtie thing, but he doesnt, so its straight..still hot. and u know..dressed like a skater dude. omg so hot! haha gotta love em. I did really like his silver thumb and pinkie rings. anyways...i should go in there more often and make him get me shoes and stuff outta the locked cabnets just so i can talk to him and ask him his opinion. haha   I went to American Eagle and got 2 shirts on sale, $15 for both of em. Now that i think about it..i forgot what they even look like..oh wait, one has a map on it and the other is green and its about "memories made here" at some hotel or resort..whatever, they were cheap and from AE, one of my fave stores. u cant go wrong in there. I did want a pair of pink carpis with fraded edges and stuff, they were like $20 but unless i was a size 0 or 4 i couldnt get em. lol fuck that.  I think went to DQ and got a hawiann blizzard. yummmm, def. worth driving the 15mins to dobson for when i get back home. :p   Everythings been great..yup...  *much love and power rangers*

      that one just published..so now many if i write a full lenght one, it will also publish...  i tried calling mom today, but i bet when grandma said "monday at midnite" i bet she really meant early tuesday morning. dammit. i wanted to talk to her about concerts and get my classes. I wanted to hear about the stuff she did and everything.   I'm so ready to come home.   Clement started talkin to me again today..dude i havent talked to him in like a year...wow hes being nice to me...lol We're gonna get drunk together. woo hoo! lol too bad all my friends will be gone...i need a buddy. lol he wants katie to come, just so he can tell "faggot andrew i got his girl drunk" umm..ok. whatever clement. He all the sudden pops up and says "julia.." and im like..whoa clement, hes actually talkin to me! so i said "hey..dude why u talkin to me?" lol he told me he was bored and then asked how i had been. we've both changed a lot, hes goin a lil less on the drugs and im going a little more on em. not really hardcore drugs..but u know..lol and we catch up a lil bit and he tells me hes proud and all this stuff haha all the sudden i got happy cuz i dunno..i used to have a crush on him and all this stuff. i really liked him. and for some reason he got mad at me or something, and we stopped talking..for a year. i deleted him and was like "fuck that" and havent thought about him since. Now he wants to hang out and get drunk. he just told me bye, but was sure to tell me hes not forgetting what we're gonna do. yea yea...maybe im cool enough for him now. lol bullshit he prob heard i was doin that stuff now instead of the sweet lil innocent "naw..i dont drink" bullshit that will ruin ur life!  DONT EVER TELL PEOPLE UR NOT INTO THAT SHIT!! IT RUINS UR LIFE.. hahaha well at least i broke outta that. lol anyways, i was worried that id have to see him at sarahs when i got home and he'd be a dick or something, but now he wants to hang out without sarah cuz shes "grody" lol gotta love that word. anyways, i all the sudden became happy when i talked to him, maybe it was the feelings left over from a year ago.   he has his license now. he wrecked his grandmas car yesterday. lol stupid dumb fuck. he gave me the whole story behind him stealing a car and totaling it. lol sarah gave me a fucked up verison. He didnt steal it, he just took it for a ride. haha I'm glad i got to talk to him actually...  Katie told clement shes been drunk before..she didnt mention it was off a bottle of wine. *rolls eyes* she totally blew it up and he asked me about it. haha  Everything you thought was fine has turned its back into time...  *much love and time bombs*

WHY?! cuz i needed a D chord..and my tuner kept saying "G flat"..."G sharp" and im like GEEZ!! I NEED A D so i keep makin it tighter and tighter since d is higher than g..and well..PING!! dammit. my damn tuner misread it. it was a D a VERY sharp D which caused it to break. UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH now i gotta go back to the music store and pay another $8 for one string. i havent told dad yet..im gonna wait until tomorrow and say it broke..i guess when i was tuning it or playing it..idk which made up story i'll use. but he'll be like WHY DO U KEEP BREAKIN UR STRINGS? haha im sure. but oh well, i'll prob give him some bullshit story about how i was told that beginers have a hard time tuning and strings get worn out easily from constantly beinging tuned. :p lol sounds believable.   mom gets back in the country tonite at midnite, but wont get home until like 2am...i was thinkin about callin her at 2:30 or 3am..but i deiced i'd call her about noon. I'm getting my pitfiul speech ready about why she needs to take me and a friend to the concert. lol i was gonna tell her that she can take john too and they can sit at the tables overlooking the lawn and me and my bud can be near the stage, but we'd have to leave after school friday and john might not be able to get off work 2hrs early..hmm...hes the manager, i bet he could lol i'll still mention john going. I CANT MISS GRAHAM COLTON BAND!!! dammit im gonna die if i dont see 'em!!  my knee is fuckin killing me. it hurts...when i go to move my leg, i can feel the bones not wanting to move with my leg. sounds weird i know, but thats what it feels like. think of someone holding ur knee straight and u trying to move ur leg around. almost a lock and pop feeling. dammit, im scared of IVs..not the cutting or the pain afterwards, they'll give me drugs for that, its the IV...lol cuz i'll have a few mins of sedative and i'll know they're puttin the IV in and flip. lol sounds like fun.  OOOH I GOT A PIC OF DANNY FINALLY!!! him and the guys (i know all of them but 1..and theres 4) decided to roll their jeans or shorts up and turn them into short shorts and run around their lil camp site or whatever so i got that pic..im sure he'd die if he knew which pic i have, but maybe not..hes hot. lol Hes not really what i pictured, i picture a dude like Taylor Kranodle or whatever lmao kranodle..dude i just screwed his name over..haha but u know who i mean lauren. him or his bro seth. i pictured their hair. Danny looks much better haha he looks like hes outta some kickass band. idk how to describe him! but hes hot. lol i'll try and send ya a pic sometime. :p   HAPPY 4TH OF JULY!! lol im going down to MTSU to see fireworks and then maybe to Nashville..exciting..oh yeah with my dad...lol im ready to come home. i need to be with people..really bad...lol   my mom better have gotten me something LV when she went..i know she did! i mean, how can u go to LV in a country where its actually affordable and not get me something?! yea..totally...lol   *much love and FIRECRACKER BOOM BOOM!!*

      today was been intresting. I got maybe 5hours of sleep last nite cuz i couldnt sleep. Then dad comes waking me up at like 8 and i fall back to sleep and then i get up..and have to be ready to leave the house at 9..ughhh we go get his hair cut and i listen to his friend play guitar and some lady called me a "doll". we then left and proceeded to hell aka the 33rd annual fiddlers jamboree. god help me. i didnt complain for a solid 2 hours about the annoying sound of a fiddle, which by the way, is a violin..hello people. and the sound of a banjo killing my brain. i was like..dude get me outta here. I then finally had enough after 2 hours and some real lousy food. i ordered a chicken salad, like u know grilled chick on lettuce with salad dressing? no..they gave me that shit u put on bread to make a sandwhich on top of some lettuce..ugh. i ate half of it and decided i hated homecooked meal places, esp. if they serve it all on paper plates and make u eat with plastic spoons. hello, if i wanted that i would eat at home. whatever..   we come home and i talk to my 2 bros and kaela. i spent about over an hour on the phone with them. then i tied to call joe, just like i said i would. well, his grandfather answered and said "sorry hun, hes out playin ball and wont be back in for a while" i was like "oh..well good you please tell him his friend julia called?" and he said "sure hun" after repeating my name like 3 times. ju-lee-a?? yes, julia...JU-LEE-A?...yes, julia. his friend julia. ok JU-LEE-A. dude..havent people heard the name julia? i guess not up there in WV. anways, i really wanted to talk to him and i had worked up a lot of guts to call all the way to WV to a house full of people i didnt even know. I then realized..i didnt leave my number or anything. Bay told me that joe had called for her but she was at walmart..wow..i was shocked he called her. well i knew he'd call her back so i gave her my number to give to him. he did call back and she said he sounded really sad and all. he told me to call him back at like 7, so i was planning on it. 10mins later the phone rings and my dad answers and its joe. i was like yay its joe!! so i pick up the phone and im like "hey u!!" we make happy chat for a few mins and i ask him how hes feeling about things. he then tells me he loaded a shot gun yesterday but then a song came on the radio and it was weird..and it made him stop. god really does answer prayers. I told him once more he scares me sometimes and he told me he scares himself. i felt like during our whole conversation he was a stranger..or a guy i had a crush on..i was nervous when i talked to him and was always thinkin of what to say next, couldnt even form a complete sentence. anyways, after a few jokes and funny stories he sounded happy. i told him i would talk to him monday and he agreed. him saying "yup, i'll talk to ya monday!" made my day. It was great to hear his voice...and i just thought of something, a few months ago, i was trying to hook catherine up with joe cuz 1) hes not the prettiest picture in the world and 2) to get cat the fuck out of my life...now that i look back on that i think "omg, how could i think that about joe?! to set him up with catherine wood..whats wrong with me?!" he really means much more to me than that. i guess u dont realize how much u care for someone until they wake u up to reality. and GEEZ, catherine deserves worse than joe. lol and now joe thinks shes also nucking futs, so..all is dandy.   This damn fish keeps swimming up to the wall of the tank facing me and looking at me. i hear fish see things distorted cuz they're in water..maybe im pretty when distorted. lmao!   *much love and ba-zoo-ca joe* yes, i realize i sounded that out and didnt spell it correctly..

      Title is a lil weird..but i just told someone that and thought it was funny..  Ya know the blink 182 song i was talkin about way back in the day? "all of this" and how mark didnt sound like himself but i could hear tom? well..thats cuz its not mark..its the dude from the cure...duhhhh. lol im so bright.   I showed bay, ash, and mikel my song tonite. it made bay upset and ash and mikel were deeply impressed. i didnt think i would get that kind of reaction. here it is:  Prefers to fly   walking through a storm as the rain pours down on ur soul life has taken its toll  u dance with the angels holding their hands tight as u wish to fly away you think their the answer, the solution, the friend but they dont want to know u until the end.  i talk to angels,but u prefer to fly.  running down lifes path  with a lot on ur mind u see a stone and wonder why ur not strong enough to kick it out of the way  u dance with the angels holding their hands tight as u wish to fly away you think their the answer, the solution, the friend but they dont want to know u until the end.  i talk to angels,but u prefer to fly.  you come in one door but want to leave through another the medicine is out of date  and the cure is too weak to mend your fate   dance with the angels holding their hands tight as u wish to fly away you think their the answer, the solution, the friend but they dont want to know u until the end.  i talk to angels,but u prefer to fly.  There ya go..theres my song. "prefers to fly"   *much love and fairy dust*

      I felt like writtin to my dear ol blog again..for like the 4th time in not even 2 days. man i write a lot in this thing. lol i guess it keeps me from being bored. right now ive been trying to play Time of Your Life over and over and over, but it's just not sounding right. i checked to see if my guitar was actually in tune..nooo, i so tried to tune it. took me 30mins to tune my freakin guitar. lol and get this-it still doesnt sound right to me!! lol but my tuner said its perfect, or pretty damn close to it. so i'll agree with my tuner.   Howcome i'm like always happy and other people arent? i wondered that a few minutes ago. now, sometimes i really get upset and think im done with and im tired of going on, but gimme 15mins and i'll be a-ok. Maybe my chemicals are just screwed up and im getting an overdose of those endorphines or whatever that make u happy. i hear its suppose to give u a high feeling..hmm..that would explain a lot. and u know how when ur nervous or ur about to go on a rollercoaster and u feel ur body release ..whats that stuff...adrelein or however u spell it, and u suddenly have a rush of energy? well, i can be sitting down completely calm and make my body do that, i once asked someone if they could do it and they looked at me like i was fuckin insane and said "no julia, i cant make my body release chemicals that it does on its own.." lol well i can. haha i felt gifted. maybe thats my problem, i naturally drug my body up..hmm..now ive made myself look like a total idiot cuz i bet everyone can do that..haha oh well.   IM FREAKIN TIRED OF THIS "FREE RED LOBSTER DINNER" POPUP!! IM ABOUT TO SCREAM! it wont go away, no matter how many times i click close or end program..it just wont go the fuck away!! GRRRRRR ok..it's gone now..wow, wonder what i did right.   I've written 2 songs in the last 2 days. one is called "the real world has left me once more" and is about how we long for such a happy world where everyone is happy and all that bullshit and the only place (and saddly enough) we can find it is in our own fantasy world. heres a line "sometimes i wonder why the city lights come on outside and wake me from my dreams" the point im makin in that line is not only do we live in a world how we want it in our dreams, but the city lights also smbolize the real hettic world...ok..i prob look like a crack head now hahaha next song. it's called "prefers to fly" i also labled it "joe's song" its about wanting to committ suicide. i wrote it so it wouldnt look like i wanted to kill myself. "walking through a storm as the rain pours down on ur soul. i talk to angels, but you prefer to fly" and the chours is "you dance with angels, holding their hand as you fly away. you think of them as friends, but they don't want to know you until the end." The first song i wrote, i ended up not liking it, but i like the "prefers to fly". i might post the whole "prefers to fly" song..idk yet..i never let people see my songs..so feel honored. anyways, im not sure if im done with both of them.   *much love and photographs*

      i just got out of the shower, dried my hair, and decided to get back online to check up on how joe and bay were doing. this is whats going on. Bay wants to break up with joe, shes like a mini katie when it comes to liking other guys when they give her attention. she tells me shes gonna piss joe off so he breaks up with her so she doesnt have to look like the bad guy once more. Joe wont break up with that girl..shes the love of his life hes always wanted. So..bay shows him conversations she had with some other guy about how they're gonna get together and "fuck". joe gets mad, and goes to this guys house, the guys in his car and speeds off, so joe follows him. they have a little talk. he tells joe that bay told him to say that kinda stuff. joe calls him a liar..i have to tell joe that brandon (the guy) didnt lie, he was right, bay did say all of that stuff. joe is heart broken and im sittin here crying for him. why am i crying? he said some very hurtful things.  He told me that he was tired of this kind of rejection and how he was never good enough, and how no one needed him. it broke my heart..he then told me he was going to kill himself. and how if he didnt come back from WV i shouldnt blame myself. he said "goodbye jules" and i begged him not to leave me worrying. he told me not to worry. he mentioned a letter he wrote to bay last nite. i begged him to please think things through and understand that its not the end of the world. he said "i'll find a way to end up in heaven, i hope i see you there" and then he said goodbye. just like that..and got offline. how can he do something like that to me?! how can he even talk like that? god..i hope he doesnt do anything stupid. please keep him safe. he just got back online. no one can understand how thankful i am right now that he just got back on. He keeps telling me his life is over and that hes tired of being hurt. i told him he was scaring me and how i was crying and wish he would just understand that it wasnt the end of the world. God..hes telling me right now how he wants to die and its the end of his world. and how hes leaving for WV in like 15min..i have 15min..to make him promise he wont do anything stupid. and does he promise? no..he says no he cant promise me. this is the worest feeling in the world. to have someone u love and care about go through this. Heartbreak breaks everyone.  JosiahBaker : but i cant take this JosiahBaker : i have to get away JosiahBaker : i have to get away from this life ~*Julesies*~: but not forever JosiahBaker : from this hell i live in.. ~*Julesies*~: u can go to WV and have a break ~*Julesies*~: and then come back ~*Julesies*~: and i'll be here waiting for u so i can pop up and say "hey u!!!" ~*Julesies*~: and then when u tell me brb i can say "yay!" when u come back to me ~*Julesies*~: when u come back home i'll be waiting just so i can say "yay! JosiahBaker : ill try to make it JosiahBaker : but i jsut dont think i can JosiahBaker : maybe this nightmare will finally be over ~*Julesies*~: please..please let me say "yay" just one more time when u come back to me ~*Julesies*~: it would be the best yay ever JosiahBaker : ok, one time  a few minutes later he's telling me goodbye before he leaves for WV.   JosiahBaker : well i have to go put evrything in the car JosiahBaker : ill talk to u if i get back JosiahBaker : pray for me JosiahBaker : call me sumtime at granny's in wV (304) 967-5285  i will call him..im afraid not to..he'll be gone until monday. i told him i'd be waiting and i loved him. and with that he told me "bye..."   Deep inside my heart i know that he wont go through with anything, the kid is too smart. but then my heart hurts because he feels this way, and theres always that chance he just might do something. i pray he doesnt. I'll prob call him saturday.   and thats been my day...  If i could, i would shrink myself, sink through ur skin to ur blood cells, remove whatever makes u hurt, but i am too weak to be ur cure...  *much love and hope*

      I just woke up a few mins ago..yeah it was 12:12..but i woke up and went back to sleep like 3 different times. I had a weird dream once again.  Me and kaela are ridding bikes through the woods, like on a trail type thing..but we're going really fast cuz we're like running away from something i think..idk but we're trying to either get somewhere real fast or get away from something real fast. anyways, theres a lil creek type thing between where we are and this field where we wanna be. She rides right over it, she must have found like a shallow place to ride through, so i think i see a shallow place, and its just mud and a little big of water. So im ridding through the little bit of water but all the sudden its really deep! so of course i jump off my bike and my bike is floating and im screaming for kaela and she comes and helps me and im like "omg omg omg my guitar!!" and i look down in the water and my guitar is at the bottom. i tell her im gonna go get it. i start swimming down and down and down and i open my eyes under water and the water is clear, and i can see the muddy bottom and then theres this dog, like a mean looking dog..rot riler or whatever they are, and hes swimming from the bottom up towards me and i get scared and start swimming up and up and up and hes coming ater me and i hit the surface and i scream "OMG OMG GET ME OUT!" and kaela helps me out of the water. Then we call the police to come and get my guitar and help us out. They're standing around and tell me to go back in the water and get it cuz they can see it and they dont see a dog. i go back..and the dog is there. They're all like "dogs cant swim underwater julia, go get ur guitar" but i wont go near it beacuse the mean looking dog. I get out of the water and sit on the bank and look at my guitar laying at the muddy bottom of the now deep creek and wishing i could over come my fear to go get it. and the feeling that people who are suppose to help me "the police", "kaela" arent helping me do what i really want to do, which is get my guitar.   Now..what a weird dream, but i must mean something cuz of the things it deals with..lol im not gonna sit here and anyalize it. lol   i take that back..i think my guitar symbolized something that i loved in life, and it was out of my reach..and i feared trying to get it back. did i just have a deep moment?! no way!   *much love and broken sea shells*

      im listening to BRAND NEW right now, rockin. talkin to katie..a drunk sarah sampson, and mikel. wow what a mixture. Katie is about to drive me fuckin up the wall with some of the worest bullshit ive ever heard..and i mean it beats all the bullshit ive ever said myself. "i like eric hart" and why did she decide she liked eric hart? hmm their conversation in a nutshell: "katie, if our school was to have a beauty pagent right now, u'd win hands down" AWW isnt he sweet. katie shows me that and said "i like eric hart, hes so sweet" WHATEVER. then i said "but u love andrew, right?" then "yeah" whatever..BULLSHIT!! i gave her this stupid story about how she doesnt need to do that to guys and how they all think she'll dump andrew for them but in all reality she liked the attention, yeah attention is nice, but not when u have a bf. her bf can give her all the attention she wants. and u REALLY dont start hopein to fuck around with ur bf and start crushin on diff guys. that just bumped nsync off the top of the lame charts. WAY TO GO KATIE!!!! hooray.   Got the chords down to Time of Ur Life. yay for me! lol ive been wanting to learn that song and well, finally i have the chords down..but it still needs some work, im not a rock star yet. lol i lost my fave pick today though. pissed me off. the only one i have like it. its one of the thicker ones, its a lot better than my medium ones. it was black and had a skull on it, lol made me feel badass hahahaha naw..the only thing that makes me feel badass is umm..i dunno, but when i find that thing i'll be sure to tell u.   I told everyone tonite i was gonna turn into a skater. hahahaha throw away all my pretty pinks for a skateboard (bam margera's pink one) and punk clothes. haha Yea..me on a skateboard..i can see that. lol execpt i gotta wait until my knee is all better to skate, so i guess i wont make any plans to star in the X-Games anytime soon. oh and by the way, if im feelin up to it im gonna throw a X-Games party hahahaha everyone should be home by then. everyone gets to come over and watch the X-Games! hot skaters!! rock on! :D but i bet no one would wanna come though...unless i gave em beer or something..haha that would work! yeah, u get my mom outta tha house and i'll let ya all crash at my house.  My next song to learn is One Thing by finger eleven.   GAWD sarah is REALLY drunk..lol she wont even remember having our conversation tomorrow i bet..oh well....lol typing while drunk, not the best thing. i tried to tell someone something once when i was a lil tipsy and he copied it and pasted it to me the next day and i had no clue what i was trying to say..hmm. but do i ever know?   *much love and the power to keep u going and going*

      you know my title was gonna be "Good to know if i ever need attention all i have to do is die" but i thought that sounded a lil morbid. haha  Today so far ive done pretty much the same as everyday, sit around. I have lost about 3-5lbs in the last week. yay for me! lol I was reading some of the past posts of mine from this week. Actually, the ones last nite, or should i say, early this morning. Wow..i have these deep random thoughts at times lol thats crazy. i scare myself sometimes. but then i read about Andrew and how hes this hot skater with a tonuge ring and it seems to make it all better, IM GOING TO AT LEAST KISS HIM dammit it's my #1 goal now. Lauren just got online! :D yay! interaction with another human. haha I'm going to the mall tonight with dad to look for him a suit for the wedding. what fun? lol oh yes. but i get to look around too! and i get to pick up a new outfit for sunday. damn, all i do is buy outfits for church. i want jeans and t-shirts DAMMIT. lol NOW! i guess when theres no more sundays for me to go to i'll get jeans and all that stuff i really enjoy trying on. Lauren just reminded me of the 4th of july...lol i forgot that it's this weekend. If she was smart she'd spend her 4th of july with lipot! gettin high..hahahaha wouldnt that be a fun. lol im jk..kinda..sorta..not really.   I found out about this awesome band. They're called BRAND NEW. kickass shit there! they really are cool. One of the best songs is Jude Law and a Semester Abroad. Well, i love all their songs!! but u know, thats one of my fave. i love the dudes voice. and i got on their site www.brandnewrock.com and u can read their journals and shit but the only one who actually keeps up with their jounral is Brian. kudos b-man. i even joined their street team so i could get to the special stuff on their site..yea, im the coolest EVER. lol   I wanna be just like Gene Simmons when i grow up! :p --but more hardcore.   *much love and sick,twisted personals*

      hey hey hey!!! im at my grandparents and i just got back from church..i was totally all drugged up in church and looked at my mom at one point and hit my arm and said "mom..i cant feel myself" lmao!! It was the youth service so it was way better than the normal church service and i hate our preacher..so yeahs.  Last nite i finally got outta the house and i went with zack, lauren and hollis to the Good Life to watch Will do this acoustic thing. We had a BLAST i swear, that was so much fun. We met some new people and sat around playing Scrabble, i hate that game with a passion but i had so much fun playing it..maybe cuz i was stoned. then me, lauren and zack went to walmart after we dropped off hollis and lauren got beads for her stuff. she made me some cute lil earrings at the Good Life..awwws so sweet. I love Will's lil sis!! shes sooo cute!! shes a kickass 4th grader..i think shes in 4th grade now. Anyways, his lil bro Jack can get annoying, but oh well. It was fun.  Hmmm....lets see....lets talk about Charlie.  Charlie goes to East, im sure ive already written about him somewhere in my blog, but we were kinda friends for a lil while then stopped talking and now we talk everyday for like literally hours. I'm going over to his house saturday nite and we're gonna camp out. Mom doesnt know that of course...she thinks im going to spend the nite with a usual friend, but shes so wrapped up in her and john that she doesnt even think to ask where im going. Sooo..this is whats happening: i was talkin to charlie and we were talkin about camping and how ive never been and how he likes to camp sometimes with his bro and get drunk, and then he told me he would set up a tent in his living room and we can camp out in front of the tv. lol awww and then he was makin fun of my stupid knee brace and it was cute. But anyways...hes all excited cuz his mom is outta town and my mom has no clue and zack is taking me to his house so far. He just lives kinda down the road, not too far. Nuttin is gonna happen anyways, cuz of my knee of course...but i like cuddling and charlie does too and he knows i like it..soooo the most that would prob happen is a lil makeout session and sleepin next to each other. More than likely we wont sleep in that tent, prob upstairs in his bed lol awwww. lol Right now though, its purely platonic. lol  Lauren is going today to meet her roomate. yay for lauren! i cant wait to hear all about it!!! :D  Anyways..off to read laurens blog and see if shes updated it!! :p  *much love and car insurence*

THEN, i was feelin nice after like 10mins and they took me to get my IV. Scared? oh hells yea, but i didnt cry. They numbed my hand, i didnt cry over that needle either..and then i didnt even feel the IV. Then i dont remember my mom leaving me..but i remember being in the operating room and they lifted my bed up and told me to move onto the metal table, i got half way and passed out, they shook me and told me to go some more, i passed out, it took me 3 tries to get on that metal slab of death. They put my arms out away from me and i asked if they were strapping me down, no was my answer. They then put a mask on me and told me to count backwards from 100. i said "100" and then i was out. I woke up and remember them taking the sticky things off of me (which they put on me..i do rememeber that) and taking the oxygen thing outta my nose and i said "i want my mommie" lol like some damn baby. lol And they told me i had to wake up more first. Apprently, the old lady volunteer wouldnt let my mom outta the waiting room cuz she didnt believe she was my mom. LMAO. my mom and i had diff last names. Anyways....she finally came. lol I dont remember this, but i called my doctor JESUS. of all names!! i chose jesus!! lol thank ya jesus!! anyways, i asked for a cherry limeaid and as my aunt was leaving to get it i put my hand high in the air and said NOOO I DONT WANT IT!! ..yeah...along with shaking my head around making a horse "nay". yea...

      Tomorrow is the BIG day....yay....knee surgery. Im so nervous. I go in tomorrow and pick up my wrist band at about 6:30am and go sit in a room which will more than likely be almost empty and shake and hold in tears until they take me back. I will then go back and change into a glamous hosptial gown, take a few pills with some water, and recieve a shot in my ass. I hate needles, i think ive made that VERY clear on my blog, but im not worried about that needle. Im worried about the next one...the IV. haha They're going to stick a little needle and numb my hand, but still...eeek. Anyways, after the IV is in i'll be calm, high, and happy. My next issue is going home. ughhhhh pain and drugs and having to climb stairs and move around.
