Stieneke   This has been a busy and hectic week and I truly meant to get this issue of Opportunity Assistance Online sent out by Tuesday, November 25, 2003. Because of personal issues and just being overly busy in general this issue didn't get out before Thanksgiving.  Therefore rather than wishing you a Happy Thanksgiving, I am hoping that you enjoyed a Happy Thanksgiving with family members and/or friends. I personally celebrated Thanksgiving on Wed. November 26 with several friends. A big Turkey was made, along with mashed potatoes and gravy, stuffing, brocolli, sweet potatoes and all of the other traditions including pumpkin pie but excluding cranberry sauce...  There isn't much left of the year 2003 and the year 2004 is rapidly rushing towards us. Hopefully, it will be a productive year for all of us despite the many changes that legislation has brought for Internet Marketing.  May God Bless you and your families over the coming weeks.  Until next issue, I remain ...  Keith P.

I certainly do not intend to try and emulate any of them in this article. Rather, I simply want to give you my thoughts and ideas, gleaned from many years experience in a training environment. Ideas which are applicable to ordinary folks like you and me.  So where on earth do you start? Start by asking yourself the question, “What do I want to achieve?” What is it that I really want? Understand that when you carry out this exercise you must suspend your negative mind. Don’t start to analyse each idea as you think of it. Definitely don’t think that you can’t achieve what you have written down. This is just a brainstorming session to get your ideas flowing. Write down big, long-term ideas, as well as small and short-term goals. For example, I would describe ‘tidy the house’ as a small and short-term goal. Whereas, ‘be promoted to CEO of my company’, as a big goal and a long term one, particularly if you have only just joined the company.  At this point it is important to put together a plan of your goals. Make separate lists of your long term goals, and your short term goals. It is generally accepted that a long term goal is one that will take more than 90 days to achieve. However, they are your goals, so you can set whatever time limit on them that you like, but make sure the limit you do set is reasonable and realistic (more on this later).  Write Your Goals Down Next write your goals down. There is something quite magical in doing this. The very act of writing a goal down somehow sends a message to your subconscious that you mean business. Write in minute detail. Describe what you want to achieve or have in colourful language. Include everything you can think of to do with a particular goal.  Let me give you an example of one of the first goals I achieved several years ago. My goal was to quit smoking! These are the exact words I used.  “At midnight on December 31st 1989, I will give up smoking. I will become a non-smoker. I will be glad to give up because it is a disgusting, poisonous, filthy, smelly, unhealthy, unsociable, selfish, dangerous and expensive habit. It will cease to be part of my life.”  I wrote those words late September 1989, and told as many people as I could that I was giving up at the end of the year. I read them everyday until December 31st when I gave up. Do you know what is so incredibly powerful about this? I haven’t smoked since, and I used to get through a pack a day.  So that you can gain maximum benefit from this exercise, I am going to share with you a word that I came across many years ago. To assist you in setting your goals I give you the word - Smart.  Make your goals SMART. What do I mean?  Your Goals should be: Specific ­ using the above goal as an example, I wrote ‘I will give up smoking’ Now that is pretty specific!  Measurable ­ From 20 cigarettes a day to none.  Achievable ­ I knew it wasn’t going to be easy, but deep down inside I knew I could do it.  Realistic ­ I gave myself 90 days. It wouldn’t have been realistic for me to try and quit the next day. My brain would not have had time to come to terms with the concept. (Incidentally, it’s a mistake a lot of people make when trying to give up smoking. They try to quit immediately, and get frustrated when their plan doesn’t work.) As with all soundly based goals, you have to be realistic and give yourself sensible targets.  And finally,  Timebound ­ This is so important. You have to set yourself a time limit on every goal you want to achieve. I gave myself 3 months to quit. I even wrote down the day and time, so that I had an absolute deadline. It worked I can tell you, and setting goals has continued to work in every area of my life.  In Closing. So now you have the tools you need, to set and achieve whatever you want for your life. As we head towards a New Year plan what you want to achieve in 2004.  Brainstorm your ideas. Make your plan of short term and long term goals Write them down Refer to them everyday Make them Smart  ‘Goals without time limits are only wishes’  Until next time, make every day a success.

Mr. Hill spent thirty years interviewing the leaders in every field. From politicians to great inventors.  His goal was to scientifically analyze the traits of the greatest achievers of his time.  As result of his study he wrote two classic self-help books "The Laws Of Success" and "Think And Grow Rich."  Mr. Hill's works are credited with creating more millionaires and helping more people achieve success in their chosen vocations than any other author.  That's the story anyone who has read his writings already knows.  But guess what?  That's not where the story ends.  Napoleon wasn't satisfied with his accomplishments and acclaim. There was still one nagging question.  Even though so many were helped by his writings, why were there others who never reached their potential, even after reading his masterpieces?  What was the missing ingredient?  What was the key?  Mr. Hill spent another 30 years searching for the Key that would help bridge the gap between those who were helped and those that never reached their true potential.  What was the missing ingredient?  Mr. Hill called it Cosmic Habit Force.  Habit is the 18th Law Of Success.  We've come to associate habits with negatives, but the truth is, positive habits are the most powerful ally on your road to success.  We all know what the Laws Of Success are, but we've never taken the time to make them a part of our daily lives.  Our actions are governed by the habits we've practiced throughout our lives.  In the words of the Duke of Wellington, "Habit is ten times nature."

By Kellie Marzolf © 2003   If you want to succeed in any type of marketing group or program, there are a few things you're going to need to plan on: an investment of your time, a lot of hard work to build your business and a sense of dedication towards your future.  You don't necessarily need to be a master at selling, but you will need to educate yourself on the fundamentals of basic salesmanship.  If you aren't willing to attempt that much then you're looking into the wrong home business.  When you're looking into any type of program you will want to pick out any and all negatives and hold them up against the positives.  This will not only help you decide if a program will work for you, but you will be able to see what kind of things your prospects may ask about and you will be able to offer more than just the standard sales pitch.  If you know what you're working with and you're happy and excited about the product or service, it will come through in your presentation.  If you are having a difficult time selling for a program, then the chances of your down line members doing well will be pretty slim.  If this occurs and you don't take the steps to properly train your first level referrals, then your membership is going to come to a stand still and eventually disappear.  Targeted marketing is something you will need to do in order to acquire serious prospects to your program lists.  You need to get your offer out to people who will be interested in your program or you will not be able to recruit any effective down line members who will make you money. Placing your ad in a gardening magazine when you're offering car parts will only accomplish a waste of your time and advertising budget.  You need to decide who your niche prospects are and where they're most likely to see your offer.  Make a list of ezines, magazines and newsletters that will more likely be seen by someone who wants to be a part of your organization.  Write an appealing, benefit-laden solo ad including your own personality it.  Prospects want to know there is a real person behind that email.  This will help you to begin that prospect relationship that will hopefully lead to an active member in your down line.  Another good reason behind writing your own ads and articles in the "stale" factor.  You've seen it time and time again.  Ads from different people but which contain the exact same ad.  After while, an ad has been so overused that it quickly gets deleted.  Put some extra effort into coming up with your own angle and arouse prospects curiosity.  A little extra work now can go a long way later.  Your main goals are to gain referrals and train them properly.  Tell them what you offer and give them the option to join.    Let them know what this will require on their part.  If they are willing to put forth the effort, welcome them in.  If they're not, then just let it go and concentrate on someone who really wants to become a success with you.  ====================================================  GIMMICKS NEVER WORK!

Pay special attention to your past customers by providing them with sales and discounts that only they are privy to.  This will help you to create long term profits for your business by building up a loyal customer base that buys your products on a consistent basis.   2. Offer the products of affiliate programs you've joined as backend products.   When deciding on affiliate programs to join, choose companies that offer a product or line of products that your niche market would want to buy.  Also pick affiliate programs that pay you high commissions or residual commissions for your referrals, and that provide you with plenty of resources that you can use to start selling their products.   3. Provide your visitors and customers with quality support by email, telephone or even live support on your site.  This will increase your visitor's trust in your company and help you to get more sales of your products.   4. Publish an ezine.   Your ezine will give you a powerful way to continue to keep in contact with your visitors and customers and obtain more sales.  Make your ezine stand out by providing your subscribers with your own unique content such as your own informative articles that build up your reputation as an expert in your field.   5. Strive to improve your ad copy and techniques you use to market your products to your visitors.   In addition, don't become complacent with your product -- continue to improve and update your product so that it will better meet your customer's needs and be more attractive to your visitors.   6. Track and test which ad copy, sales, and promotions bring you in the best result.  This will save you time and money by helping you to pin point what works best for you in marketing your products.   7. Add a sense of urgency to buying your product by offering your visitors a limited time only discount.   For instance, you could offer your special discount to only your next 100 customers or to only the customers that buy your product before a specific date.   8. Increase your product's perceived value by providing your visitors with a way to earn an income promoting your products.    For instance by creating an affiliate program your visitors and customers can join or by giving your customers the resell rights to your product with their purchase.  ------------------------------------------------------------  Article © by writer, Ken Hill.

Stieneke   Welcome to the first issue of 2004. This is the year that  newsletters will be following a new code of conduct in order  to comply with the new anti-spam legislation.  The new legislation states that all email such as newsletters  shall have a physical mailing address given as well as a way  to opt out of receiving the subscribed to publication.  Opportunity Assistance Online has always followed these  guidelines.  In addition to this being a new year, the look of the  Opportunity Assistance website homepage located at   urlLink http://www.opportunityassistance.com  has been revamped as  have many of the other pages of the site.  I encourage you to visit Opportunity Assistance and leave a  message in our guestbook or at our forum.  Until next issue, take care...  Keith  ------------------------------------------------------------  Bible Verse Of The Week    "We urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage the  fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone." -1 Thessalonians 5:14 NASB ------------------------------------------------------------  Thought Of The Week    Not one of us knows what effect his life produces, and what  he gives to others; that is hidden from us and must remain  so, though we are often allowed to see some little fraction  of it, so that we may not lose courage. The way in which  power works is a mystery. --Albert Schweitzer (01/14/1875-1965) ------------------------------------------------------------  New Subscriber Introductions  - If you are a new subscriber  to Opportunity Assistance Online and want to tell us who you  are and your interests please feel free to do so and we will  print your statements here:   My name is Steve Coffey and I have a hobby of writing articles on how to be successful in life.

George McClelland,  urlLink mailto:webmaster@www.wealthwit.com  ************************************************************ ------------------------------------------------------------  Is Your Program Right For You? by Kellie Marzolf © 2004   Before you become involved in any program, the most  important thing you can do is research.  Learn and think  about the product.  Is it something you could benefit from  personally?  Could you see yourself recommending it to a  friend or family member?  Do your homework and find out as much about the program and  the people that run it as you can.  Get a feel for the  operation and see if it will be a good fit.  You want to  find out exactly what you'll be becoming a part of as this  will save you some time and discouragement in the future.  As you pick your program, you need to be aware that in order  to expect to make any profit, the product or service needs to  be one that appeals to a lot of people.  It has to be one that  you feel confident putting your name on.  Your name is your  reputation and you have every right to be picky.  Does this program provide you with sales material and  training support? If your sponsor is not active in training  you, do they offer the option of being placed with another  one?  It will ultimately be your decision how much time and  effort you're going to spend developing yourself and your  program, but does the program offer the tools to help you  succeed?  Make sure the program is everything they tell you it is.   Many people are charmed into signing up for something and  then being left to wonder what to do next.  They aren't  trained on how to sell, who to sell to and the fact that  their payoff is related to their participation.  You will more than likely have people signup and expect  financial miracles; incomes without the effort.  They'll  hang around for two or three months and then jump to the  next hot program to come out.  These are known as "MLM  Junkies", always wondering why they can't succeed in making  their fortune.  Are you one of these people?  I hope that you're one of the  smart marketers that understands that you need to work one  program, stick with it for at least a good solid year or  until you start seeing positive results before you take on  a new program.  Jumping programs and adding are two different  things.  Those who jump will rarely accomplish anything but a  depleted bank account.  Those who add with patience and  persistence will eventually accumulate several multiple  streams of income that could very well lead to the life  they aspire to have.  So, what are you?  I hope you won't be a jumper.  It will  take time and effort but the rewards will far outweigh the  work.  ====================================================  Join GFTGD Newsletter!

Tell them they can pay for your product or service with easy monthly payments. For example, you could say, "You Can Own Our Product With 3 Easy Payments Of ($)!" Another idea would be to eliminate one of those payments later on in your ad copy.   2) Give your prospects extra confidence so they will order.  Use endorsements, testimonials, a strong guarantee or warranty, etc. For example, you could say, "I'm going to allow you to try out our product for a full 60 days without billing your card!"   3) End your sales letter or ad copy with a strong closing.  It could be a free bonus, a discount price, a benefit reminder, an ordering deadline, etc. For example, you could say, "P.S. Remember, you'll get 5 bonuses valued at $245!" Another example would be, "P.S. Like mentioned earlier, if you order today you'll get 45% off!" ----  FREEE eBook!  5000 Words & Phrases That Sell Like CRAZY!  urlLink http://www.ldpublishing.com    ------------------------------------------------------------  Free Subscriber Ads  urlLink http://www.opportunityassistance.com/subscriberfreebies.html     Weekly FR*E Advertising to 200,000+ & Much More  at  urlLink http://tinyurl.com/kult  ************************************************************ ------------------------------------------------------------  Quote Of The Week    Recipe for success: Study while others are sleeping; work  while others are loafing; prepare while others are playing;  and dream while others are wishing. --William A.
