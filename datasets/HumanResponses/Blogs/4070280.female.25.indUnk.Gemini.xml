       sometimes i feel like the whole world's against me everywhere i turn to, i end up unhappy i cry silently, my tears drop inside me my face keeps smiling, but my heart fails me...  although i try hard, i cannot understand people why are they so mean? why they don't care? is it always me? what am i missing to share? what am i doing wrong? why is this always the same?  why everybody comes and talks behind others' backs? do they do that to me too when i am the one who's not there? who should i trust? is there anyone out there? or should i live with it and look like i don't care?  i am sick of fake people, i wanna shout out loud! i am sick of tolerating them, i want to be heard too i don't wanna be the one who understands 'em no more the only thing i want is to be understood too!  everything is mutual i live one-sided if i'll live alone then&nbsp;leave me alone and don't be fake no more..  11:20am 30.09.2003 tuesday

       today i woke up at around 10am and sooo wanted to do smth fun.. i was like.. lets go to this place.. to that cafe with nice view and all that. but then aunt invited us to their place coz she said she baked pastry and invited us ladies for tea. (bro, sis, dad r out of town)       being to late to everywhere else, i thought i at least should take mom to grandfather's.. (aunt & grandfather live together) coz then at least somebody would be happy:) i love my grandfather alot, but i was in the mood to spend the day outside somewhere coz the weather was fine.. but then i thought i've been such a bad granddaughter lately and haven't visited him as much as i used to be. so i decided i should make my gpa happy rather than going out n chilling..      so anyway, we went there.. i asked how gpa been, he said he has been resting today. (he had heart attack twice, and has been paralyzed twice too - after my granny passed away.. ) :/ so yeah he was weak today, he was resting. he also said he doesnt feel good coz its been two months i havent visited him. actually it wasnt two months but i used to visit weekly so if i disappear for a while, he misses us and thinks its been ages.. last i went there, he was sleeping and i only stopped by for smth so i couldnt stay long, and didnt wanna wake him up either. so he didnt know i went there.. but anyway.. my point is.. he misses us so much when he doesnt see us, and .. he even gets sick after we come back home. he loves us so dearly.. and i realized how much of a bad granddaughter i've really been.. :( lately coz of hectic work life, i dont go visit him on Wednesdays (thats when my mom goes to both visit and have bazaar shopping there for years.. since we were lil kids, so its such a custom for us to be there every Wednesday but lately i've been skippin coz im too tired after work..)       i havent gone there in the weekends too, always have some stuff to do like they r important.. :/ but i definitely felt so bad when i've seen my dear gpa saying he's been feeling bad coz he cannot see us :(((((( i told him i've been so busy at work and was too tired after work, so i decided to go home instead.. but i know this aint an excuse..      God knows how we will be when we are old.. maybe we will need people around us but we wont have anybody who cares.. maybe we will need some medical help but we wont be able to get it.. maybe our kids will be ignorant and never ever ask how we are doing?? who knows!!      so i felt so empty. like.. if i lose my grandfather one day, i'll regret the most. coz i have chance to visit him, hug him and talk to him now.. and im just missing the chance..      him and my granny were the only people i counted as ANGELS living on earth, granny has become a real angel now (inshallah) and my gpa is the only one left that i can hug dearly and he will always pray for me, always love me unconditionally..and will always think of me..      i love my mom & dad too ofcourse, they r precious.. but my grandparents were different in my heart. may Allah give my gpa longer years to be with us and may Allah protect him always...      now i realized once again how much i missed my granny and her tight loving hugs.. :( hope she's resting in peace, hope she's in a better place now.. thats what she deserved..       on the lighter side, i took my niece to a park near the sea.. thats in the place my grandparents live. they live in a coastal place. such a tiny cute place.. like a quiet village.. so anyway, i took niece to the park, we walked abit. i bought her a cotton candy.. we watched the sea, the Bosphorus.. then she played a bit in the playground. a guy gave her a lil flower but she didnt want to take it (she's 6 btw) then the guy gave the flower to me to give her. i took it, then went near my niece to give it. she is well aware that she cannot accept anything from strangers, so she was being cautious.. im now thinking if i ruined that image in her mind or not? :P coz while she was being careful, i accepted the flower n gave her. :) what us adults know anyway.. :P we had a refreshing time near the sea with her today, then we went back to gpa's house,  had tea, ate yummy stuff my aunt baked (she's a perfect cook) then we came home..      ok i talked too much. but thats how i felt today.. :)

        The new Masih Dajjal has risen and is called Moneymakers.... insurance companies and banks, governmental institutions and other greedy non-social non-beings! Hidden behind their glass windows of fake transparency they look at individuals as preys! Always awaiting an opportunity to tackle us and enslave us in their system. They hijacked the lawsystem, with sweet words and big bucks they bought the complete system which was designed to protect innocent civilians, and use it for their own purposes!       What is the matter with me you wonder? The case is that my day is ruined by a letter from a Baillif's office that I have to appear in court august the 11th, only to pay a bill of a lousy € 72,19 I owe to an insurance company... my last bill to them from January! But now they claim a total sum of € 231,76, including all cost for the lawsuit. I dont care about the money, I care about the principle that the insurance company did indeed sent me reminders, but they never listened or even thought about the fact that I may be not capable of paying the sum at a certain time!       The january sum should be paid in februari, at that time I was in India at the wedding of one of my best friends. I was a guest of honor and participated in a traditional nikah (wedding ceremony). This was planned months before, and how could I refuse? Then the payment should be no problem, but it is when you get fired for a holiday! That was the price of my short trip to India, my manager had told me: go and never come back! So I went, I'm not impressed by threats and I'm willing to face the concequences.       This time the concequence were, I lost my job and was unemployed for some months. A time in which I went totally backrupt and couldnt depend on anyone. Not that I blame anyone, my family and friends are not able to support, I dont expect them to.... but some institutions should be able and willing to. And then I mean, the so called social institutions of our social or christian democratic Netherlands or the banks! But apparently, as long as incorporated is not behind your name and your debts are less than €1 or $1 billion, they dont understand the meaning of  debtswap , sad. I should have renamed myself into  Enron  or  Worldcom  maybe  Ahold  or  Shell  would do in the Netherlands.... billions are flooding in then. But my small amount is too insignificant for them. But it is significant enough to sue me! In dutch we say  you cant strip a bold chicken , wich means, you cant take anything from someone who hasnt got anything. But these prayers to Masih Dajjal (Mammoth) would enslave you if it was possible!       And that's sad and gives me a frustrative feeling, an  Anger ! More and more I get dissapointed in the so called enlightend western society, I dont think I find anything better anywhere else though. So what to do? Change the  system  maybe? Inshallah that is possible, though it will be a livetimes achievement....

       Smart and curious as I am, many misstakes come from this deadly combination! Thus I am discovering the way this blogging works. I invite some friends, of whom 1 gladly accepts (I leave it to you who was glad, she or me). Coz her experience exeeds mine, I made her administrator.... then curious I clicked on the admin-tab behind my name...... and I was gone! Couldnt do a thing anymore. It was like locking your car carefully and then proudly staring at your keys in the contact! Duhhh.... so stupid!  Gladly my friends are rather nice, and they know me, thus begging to get back into the party scene is not such a disgrace. One needs grace anyway to get it dissed! I wont say I dont have any honor, but I dont think you would find it on the net, where you can find it? well search for yourself please, if I give it away it's not finding but getting!  Anyway, I learned the hardway, and now I am here to stay, inshallah!

       Normally my days are rather easy, well they shud be! I am a junior communicator and mediator and shud walk behind my senior. Watching, learning and sometimes taking over bullshitting. But now everybody is on holiday, and they left me with some weird assignments! Hmmmm scary? naah I dont think so, the maximum thing they can do is fire me...... so what, there is more in life than acting like a slave to the system of money! Anyway, I just consider it a kind of medieval mastersprove..... they test me... and when they get back I get judged! Well they better judge me, coz when I work my ass of and they dont give a damn, I'm gone!  So what assignment do we've got here today? I actually have no clue, seriously..... I was told to get my ass somewhere over and then there was a void in the communication! Yeah weird for a communications dept. (well department doesnt quiet fit the situation, we are with 2 persons, hehehe)..... I have to watch some trailers in a manufacturinghall... and it can be exciting, coz there can be police attending (once there were threats in this project..... I dont believe the hype)  Enough about work, let's talk fun things, but these have to wait till nighttime!

       Sometimes we think there is only us in this world and nothing else matters. We think in times of disarray and confusion, that we are alone in this world and no-one really cares. It is in these times some of us turn to our deepest spiritual self and become model religious beings. Well at least I have thought this way sometimes. Especially in the times recently when I faced some trouble which were rather big, but not worth to mention! However now I am confused about this matter!  Coz recently I have found some people who DO care and who are there, no matter what! And even the distant between them and me is so incredible that I even wonder, how is it possible? Allah (swt) has strange ways of making people meet. And I've met some people in strange unexpected places who became very valuable. What else makes me wonder is why? Why dont we dare to rely on friends? why do we think we are all alone in matters of hardship, while some of us will stand in line when it comes to help dear-ones? I do at least, I try to, and some friends here in the Netherlands know. I'm the first one they call..... So to speak for myself, why am I always there? I duno, it's just some ***** (dont know any word for it, it's something like: urge, great drive, a strong feeling of my heart, maybe I'm just a weak personality who cant say no? I duno)... what I do know is that sometimes when looking at severe missery from parts of this world I do feel sad and tears rise, so I just think I am a very sentimental weak idiot, coz most friends and family here doesnt feel any, or well they say: pitty isnt it? while pitty was not among my thoughts!  But now, and here I wanna thank one, who made me go and study, by making a bet with me! Best thing you can do, I have this competitive drive, never wanna loose any bet! She became shocked coz of some rather harsh remarks she made another day on the phone. Well you know who you are, so I wont name anyone, keep this piece mysterious, unless she reveals hereself..... Thank you my dearest.... from the deepest of my heart! An example to many you should be! And abt those rather unhappy conversation, well let us say, it was just what I needed, some kick on my ass to get me moving! Inshallah, I'll keep on moving till my nemesis is terminated, ritually burned together with my diploma..... hmm well yeah of course after I used it for a job app.... oh wait, I already got the job! So my diploma is only usuable as toilet paper! Well does this express my ideas about my study? I admit, it's bassically my own fault, but also the philospher in me who wonders, what's the added value of some paper? Where is the valuing of people? Like, I do value my friends, so very highly..... no paper can express that, so I wont reward them a diploma:  Master in being Ameer's Friend    well if you want that, well ok, lemme make it!  Not to insult anyone else, I would like to thank all my fellow contributors and reading friends here for their support and friendship..... love you all!  take care

       Hmmm anyone interested in how I felt yesterday? Actually I dont think so, in the case you are very sensitive...... dont read indeed!!!!!    ok, so I warned you! My day started rather well, though I didnt had breakfast and couldnt take a lunch with me..... I had been moving stuff of my grandmother the whole saturday and shops in this incredible stupid country are closed on sundays! Lemme make a sidetrack here:       the Netherlands is discussing the concept of an 24/7 economy for the last decade! Like all stupidities here, it remains with talking!!!!        So no breakfast, no lunch, but an apparently indestructable mood! I went to the office, which is located in a small village. After few hours working I remembered the only shop in the village closes early so around 11am I ran to it only to discover they were on holiday! Then I wanted to go to the only snackbar in the village: closed on mondays!!! Ok, so no breakfast, no lunch.... that would become a rather hard day!        you have to know: I have serious underweight, not eating is like living on reserves I aint got.... wearing me out very much! Willpower drags me through Ramadan and/or occasional days I dont eat!       The day went by, with huge lose of concentration.... well what do you want? And I closed quickly to catch the bus, I once missed it coz I was too late, so at 5.30pm I stept out the office, turned to the corner of the street and saw my bus passing....... the bus wich should arrive at 5.37pm!!! 7 minutes too early.... I dont like those drivers who cant use their watch! I mean especially in this village, there is 1 bus, once an hour! I quickly regained my good mood and started for a walk, how far could it be? the bus takes me in 30 minutes to the trainstation! So I started walking, must be said, I didnt wear shoes but slippers.... It was an incredible bright day and I was well on schedule to beat the second bus as well! Until my old sports injury came up.... my knees, dropping my speed drastically the last miles were not so much aching, but they were slow! My own misstake, I didnt mind! Thus I crossed the most beautifull undutch brigde: The Rhine Bridge at Rhenen (a big village, but still very small, though it has a trainstation).... you walk from the Betuwe lowlands into the Utrecht-hills where these hills touch the Rhine.... BEAUTIFULL...       The trainstation is just after the bridge and I was there at 7.11pm, so 1,5hours walking, and pitty I just missed the train (7.03pm) but the next one should arrive soon (7.33pm). I sat down, took a rest, listened to some music and waited.... 7.35pm I waited, 7.45pm a message: Due to a traincrash there was NO traffic towards or from Rhenen..... WTF?, how do you get out of such a small town I wondered! There our railroad company is fully owned by the government, dont expect any service! There is a pole on small stations like Rhenen, you can press a button and inshallah get some assistance! So I did and I asked the sweet student at the otherside........ Is there any chance that I will make it home and get my dinner!!!!!!! Well, there was a chance that I would be home before midnight....... well so far, thanks to this incredible sad government who cant get their acts together! Thanks to the Stupid Railroads who dont know how to drive a train! I mean, how difficult can it be to keep a train on the track? There is no where to go????        I called my closest friend to calm down, he was laughing at my tirade..... I asked him, why dont they call the unemployed airforce and blow the train of the track! that will clean up....... then you only have to remove the last pieces! Yes sorry, when I get annoyed.... and the Dutch society has this incredible ability of annoying me lately! I have never met or read about any group of people who behaves so sad.... they accept everything! No-one at the station was angry? they just walked back home..... well easy for them, my home is at the other end of the line..... I was hungry and tired!      After my friend and I disconnected (did calm me down a bit), I went back to the station and listened if they called new information! And surprise, surprise, the train of 8.03 pm should arrive! Which would be a masterpiece...... it was 8.02pm there was no train in sight ( Rhenen station gives an incredible good sight, you can see the train coming from miles away! ), and if it arrives the driver should walk to the other side (Rhenen is final-destination)... which takes him minutes, so no matter what, they were much tooo late.... 8.20pm still no train a new message, the train of 8.34pm should not go........ I was like, if I ever meet the lady who calls these messages I will ask here were the train of 8.03pm has left to???? My God....... and the worst thing is, that stupid railroad company doesnt made any delay on the track Utrecht-Rhenen v.v. and having delays is a hot topic, coz they got permission for a drastic raise in their ticket price, because of  good service and no delays ! This they only make because of a flawn in their service contract:  a cancelled train does not count as a delay!  Think about it....no where in that contract is named that the cancelation should take place a certain time before departure! So now the cancel ON departure time..... I call that fraud! This is the state of the Netherlands, the way we deal with eachother, the way we are governt, or beter said: NOT GOVERNT, COZ!!!! I have a really low esteem of our politicians yes! I really dont like them all, each and single one of them. I can know, I met them closely when I was involved in politics: best decicion I made ever: get the out of Dutch politics!      So I needed a break, I called my mom.... in many cases a source of calmness to me. So I started my whole tirade again. I asked her, why we ever let the Germans go ( ehh for the ones not familair with European history: Second World War, German occupation. Trains did leave on time!)??? Can we call for a second occupation by the Germans??? I mean, I know they did many thigs wrong, but at least things worked !) After I calmed down.... nice mom: saying I should get something to eat.............. aaaaaaarrrrgggghhhh.....I asked her, why her generation (now in control) has ruined up this nation so much? I mean, we're supposed to be a developed country! In India the trains depart on time for god's sake! We are the 7th richest nation in the world, the 3d investor in the USA (after Japan and the UK), but we cant get trains leave on time????? How's that? And by the way, they cant give me a good and stable broadband connection either!!!! Well yeah, when I get started I pick everything at one time, but my internet is surely bad!      I went away from that place of doom and went looking for some information about an alternative. Finaly I found this bus, going to Utrecht! But I just promised myself never ever to set foot in such a thing...... they are driven by drivers who depart too early! My mom told me to get in and shut up, hehehehe I told her that I would threaten the driver that, if he made one misstake, one flat tire, accident or anything I would beat him!... So I get on board, was a bit unfriendly to the driver, went all the way back not to get irritated and did the best thing to calm down: FELL ASLEEP!!! Jazak'Allah, I'm gifted with the abilty to sleep everywhere, anytime! At 9.30pm I was in my own city (hmmm to international standard: town)... I went straight to the supermarket, bought loads of food and drinks and got home at 10pm..... 4 and a half hours, which should take 1 and a half!!!! I was soo hungry but wanted to refresh and do my namaz first, I almost fainted while performing! After namaz I sat in my chair sended my mom and friend a  thank you  txt message and started a DVD to watch..... it was 10.30pm when I was finished namaz, dinner and all....My knees hurted very badly, while doing namaz, getting up was near impossible. Hmmm writing this all down is like almost reliving the memory!       Today the train did leave on time and I've brought me skates, no dependency on the bus! it took me only 30 minutes to skate to my office! Inshallah the train will be on time tonight. I still seriously reconsider my stay in this stupid country... I wanna leave! Anyplace is better than this junkyard here..... the crap the people create here is so bugging me.... I spit on them! Only advantage of today was: during skating I didnt felt my knees, so that's an improvement, a good nights rest has done them good.... inshallah they'll keep this way!      My sincere appologies for the language at some points.... I didnt want to correctt it though!    this post is re-edited due to some messages received in another scrap..... I dont want people to get offended. I removed all bad words!

       My weekend, so unexpected relaxing, you have no idea! It all started saturday morning after only some few hours sleep! I talk in the weekends till early mornings, catch Fajr and go to sleep! Normally I sleep till late, but today I had to shift stuff of my grandmom to her new apartment! My uncle and dad where already there at 10am, I should pick up my best friend who came to help! So at 10.30 we started, only to discover that the heavys stuff would be moved by a transport company! After few closets we were ready. Then we moved a fridge to my apartment and the work was done. I went with my friend, and the rest of the afternoon we spent chatting at his place..... calm and nice, we ordered som chinese food coz unexpected two of his aunties came to visit and then I went home early coz he had to go to family!      I had my nightly weekend chat, which was very much fun again and went sleeping..... only to wake up at 1pm.... I surely need some holiday I guess... but then dont talk about holiday, mine was withdrawn! I started chatting with my Sweet Little Friend, he is 10 years and the son of my  Lieverd  (dutch for sweet)... so I chatted the afternoon with him and his mom, and with a dear Pakistani friend of me from Saudi Arabia..... in between I was cleaning my new fridge (second hand, which has been stored at my grandmom's for months!) and the rest of my room..... I was busy till late night had some food and started watching Tomb Raider: Craddle of Life..... nice entertainment while chatting......after midnight the movie had ended and I was about to go 'n sleep when my Pakistani Muse popped on MSN and we chatted for few hours.... finaly at 3am I went to sleep.... and woke up this morning at 7am.      The most fascinating part of this weekend is the duality! I met some people (my parents, uncle, friend and his GF) and chatted with many more..... and still I have the feeling of spending my weekend alone, but in a positive way... so not like " lonesome " or " lonely ", and I know that some of the people I chatted with read this and think: wtf, I'm nothing for him? But that's not true..... with alone I mean: most of the time I was physically alone, there was no-one around! But mentally I was surrounded by soo much friendschip and peace....... I really enjoyed! Well maybe I cant put it into words, inshallah I find the proper words to express my feelings and emotional state of being, hehehehe      Hereby I can only say, thank you, jazak'Allah for your warmth and a nice weekend and I hope I participated in a nice weekend for you as well!
