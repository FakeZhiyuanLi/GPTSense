      One day we will have to build a pillow fort. That's right, a fort made of pillows. And then we can make signs to hang from them like "No girls allowed" or "None shall enter without the secret password." Oh man, forts are so bad ass. That will be the day...

      I've decided to start the National Organization of Pillow Enthusiasts. After that decision was made, it was only natural that this national organization, just like all the other national organizations, have a web site. And so it was born, the NOPE homepage. Here you'll be able to stay up to date on the NOPE news. You'll be able to get in touch with the organizations president (me), and suggest ideas, or comment on his brilliancy. Now I know you all have questions. So let me answer a few before you go blabbering away.   Why was this organization formed?    As a young man I had always wanted to be part of something big. Perhaps, a world record or something. As I am still a young man, I've found my chance. The largest pillow fight had only 645 participants. I figure, by utilizing the internet, and creating an organization of sorts, I could easily gather more people than that to join in a pillow fight.    So if this organization is about pillow fighting, why enthusiasts?    Because NOPF doesn't sound as good as NOPE, duh!    How can I join pillow fights?    Right now, pillow fights will only be held in the St. Louis County area. If you live in the area, stay tuned to this website. We will have updates on when and where pillow fights will be held.      I don't live in St. Louis, but I still want to contribute.      That's not a question. What do you mean money? That may be set up shortly. If it is, I'll be sure to inform everyone. Most likely you meant suggestions. Just click on the comments link at the bottom of a post, and add your two cents. It's a piece of cake. mmmm cake.     Well, that should take care of some of you. Anyone else got a problem? Leave a comment.

      Last night the National Organization of Pillow Enthusiasts began with its first pillow fight. It was completly impromptu. While we were at Sam's house we got some pillows. Jordan, Ellen, and Anna decided it would be a good idea to just go driving somewhere. we took the pillow. we went outside. we jumped on the mini. Kate actually was on top. She likes it on top. They drove off. She was still on top. I told you she likes it on the top.  They came back two minutes later. We hid behind doors. We hit them with pillows. They attempted to fight back and failed miserably. Fun was had by all...minus the losers. what losers.  Sleep deprevation has brought this post to an end.
