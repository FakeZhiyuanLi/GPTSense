      Rap is all the same. Its really lame. Even more lame than "He Got Game". How many bitches and ho's do you need? Don't you know they are expensive to feed? Do you think your cool because you can show off your bling? Why the Hell is it even called bling? Its not even a cool looking ring. Hell, this rap could go triple platinum.

      “Alright folks, are you ready for the fight of the 20th century?” The announcer hollers into his microphone.  	“I’m Don Vito and I’m the host for this evening. Now, lets get this fight started!” Don Vito yells into the microphone as he scratches the crease between his thigh and ass cheek.  	“In the red corner – you know him from his god-like dancing skill, maybe you know him from his guest appearances in many movies and T.V. shows, I give you the god of soul, James Brown!”   	The crowd goes wild, no one can hear Don Vito as he tries to speak into the microphone, and all that is heard is the chant of James Brown’s name.  	“James James James James!” The crowd chants as James Brown dances across the ring.  	“In the white that was once black corner- Michael Jackson!” At that second the lights go out and Michael Jackson walks out with beat it playing on the huge speakers. 	 	“You may know him as the creator of Thriller, but I sure as hell I know him as the king of pop!” a murmured voice said under the music.  	“I love animals, and I love children, now you gonna get danced upon oh-wee-hee” Michael said as one hand was raised in the air and the other was securely cupping his genitalia.  	“I feel good hoo-haa-ungh!” James grunted while droplets of sweat dripped from his face.  	They make their way to the middle of the ring and began throwing dance after dance moves at each other. James couldn’t hit Michael; his infamous Moonwalk was too much for the aging soul god. It looked as if Michael had won the match but then a pack of ravenous one-legged Russian prostitutes swooped Michael up in their cheaply made lingerie sack and drug him into the back alley where they tore his clothes off and hung upside down on a light post with a bondage ball in his mouth. After a few days without food for water, Michael was dead, and James brown was announced as the new heavy weight champion of the world.

      I love metal  I can’t get it out of my head Ranging from death to black to even power The dark chunks of death metal The speed and screech of black metal The righteousness and mightiness of power metal I love metal In Flames, Children of Bodom, As I Lay Dying I can’t get it out of my head The melodic sound of In Flames The solos of Bodom And the beautiful distortion of As I Lay Dying I love metal

      I need a Gibson Voodoo SG  I think about it all the time, even when I pee  I think I am in love  I want it to look at me above  As my fingers shred through the frets  I need a Gibson Voodoo SG  It is my one and only  How much longer will it be  Before I get my precious Voodoo SG

      Mr. Kitty  (Miss-cho-kitty)   I have a really badass cat He is uber sexy He is orange and kinda fat He is so cute I think he’s gonna give me Epilepsy  His fur is as smooth as silk There is no sexier feline His tummy is as white as milk All the chicks want his body, but he is too fine so he must decline  He loved to sleep in my bed  I didn’t mind when he left fur on my blanket  Hell, I didn’t even care when he would bite my head  Every time he ate it was like he was at a banquet  His nipples were really pink  Every time I stared at them he would shoot me a wink
