      Well yet again I have to post to make changes take hold, I will add my first substance this time.  I am a male to female pre-op transsexual,  I am living full time as a woman, and I am working towards my ultimate goal of sexual reassignment surgery.  As an explanation to those who are genetically gender congruent, this is a birth defect, we are as a group not doing this out of some perversion, or for sexual satisfaction.  We are not like this because "uncle Charley" or our priest abused us as children.  We basically were for some reason born with brains that don't match our bodies.  Some studies suggest that we are the way we are due to an influx of hormones while in the womb, but we may never know for sure.  We are also as a group not sissies, or just running away as cowards, some of the bravest and toughest people I know are trans.  We also are not doing this for fun, this is not fun, nor is it easy.  Nobody truly wins in going through all this, you just get to a better place.  The term transgendered should not be confused with transsexual.  Transgendered is an all encompassing term for lots of different groups, including cross dressers, gender bender, flamboyant drag queens and kings, among others.  Firstly nothing in this world is black or white, we live in a world full of colors, and we should embrace it.  I will over time come up with a quick little glossary for those who are first timers.  ALL ARE WELCOME HERE, JUST KEEP YOUR HEARTS AND MINDS OPEN, AND YOUR PREJUDICES SOMEWHERE ELSE.

      February 29th 2004.  Oh well I did it, my very first website.  Thank God for idiot proofing!  The intention of me creating this site is to share not only my stories about being trans, but for others who have a story to share too.  This is what I am calling a story board, sometimes message boards do not allow you to hop up and tell your story without fear of getting flamed.  I will not allow such commentary to go out, so don't worry, and I am in no position to judge anyone myself.  I promise not to edit content of stories I choose to post, but I will not post anything x-rated or just all out not for mixed company, sorry.  This invite is out to all in the trans community, including SO's, family, friends and allies.  For any story you wish to submit please email them to me trans-story@cox.net.  Please do not send them as attachments, just create them in your favorite program and cut and paste.  Remember I will not edit, so check your spelling if it matters. Ashley

       Back into the belly of the beast...  Well, after three long tedious boring days of sitting in a smoke filled office, learning stuff I pretty much already knew, I am heading back on the road.  I am scared to death right now about how my customers will react.  I can't be sure how or if they are going to take to the new me, I just have to try.  Its time for me lay my cards down and see what I got,  I have been spouting how good a job I thought I was still capable of doing, now is the time to see if I was full of shit, or right on.  I am heading into a very difficult area, it was one of my most productive areas in my last job, along with one of highest concentrations of nasty people.  A few of them know about my transition, so I won't be able to just go in as Ashley to these folks, they already know.  For everyone else I am taking the Principal Skinner approach to it all.  To all those who aren't Simpson's fans Principal Skinner was found out not to be who he was pretending to be, but the towns people appreciated his hard work enough to pretend they didn't know about his situation and just let him be Principal Skinner. I never thought I would want to live my life like a Simpson's episode, but that is the case here.  I hope my life will turn out as good as this cartoon did. I feel it is good to get this out of the way now, and see if I can do it.  If I find after a week or so that I can't cut it in my old field due to old baggage I will have to reevaluate things.  I need to know for my own piece of mind to know where I stand with certain people from my old life. I hope within a few months people will be over things, and no one will even mention Scott anymore, just Ashley.  I can't guarantee what will come of things, but at least a can say I tried.  I love this  attitude I  acquired after seeing Anthony Robbins a few years back, that trying is half the battle, many people aren't brave enough to even try.  I have learned that the best way to fail is to not try at all, and to me failure is not an option.  I have gained so much courage in doing this, I am becoming comfortable with myself for the first time in my life.  Of course I have been neurotic as all hell these last two months and I still have to get used to these self image issues I have.  It is just so hard to take compliments about looks when you have hated yourself for such a long time.  I also never was a person who was into looks, now though I am learning to use them to my advantage, and enjoy them while they last, unfortunately they won't last long.  To me it is more important to be well rounded and pretty all over instead of just on the outside.   Everything else is Kosher on other stuff, I have wicked bad allergies from spending the last three days with a chain smoker,and the trees are starting to pop.  I am working on the blanket, and some other heavy stuff still.  I will be sure to give you all a report tomorrow night and let you know how I did in the belly of beast, I should learn quickly how this whole thing is going to play out. Wish me luck, I know you all will be behind me in every store I trod.  Hopefully things will turn out for as well as the did for Armand Tanzarian.   Love you all, take care.

       Still trying to be a man for Dad...  Rough night last night.  Had a heart to heart with Dad about something I need to digest a little more before sharing.  Sorry but you guys don't always get all the details on everything.  Basically Dad and I were talking about how to handle a situation, and more than anything I wanted to cry.  I let my voice crack, but saved myself before falling into crying.  I told myself I still have to  be a man for Dad.  He is feeling low enough about his manliness between me being like this, and my little brother's homosexuality. Shawn and I aren't like this due to my Dad, my Dad is a fine man, and a good person all around.  My brother and I just were unlucky victims of a genetic crap shoot.  Something from the genetics from Mom and Dad's DNA pool just aligned in the wrong way.  So anyway, I kept from crying, held my composure and cried afterwards.  It was so tough, because Dad was telling me what I knew myself, but was afraid to admit.  It is a hard thing I have to do, but it is my fate.  I made my bed, now I must lay in it.  Forgive me, for not sharing now, it will become more clear later, and I will be in dark mode after my task is done.  Hope you guys aren't sick of my moods. Love you all, take care.

       Not much new here...  Day two of work, no biggie.  My boss did well no slip ups, he did flip out at the other workers twice on non me issues.  Cool to see he is human.  Nobody has really asked me anything yet, they are keeping their distance right now, which is cool.  I feel I am knowledgeable enough to educate, but I also just want to be treated like everyone else, which is exactly what is happening.  Going out in the field will be a different story I am sure.  Going to work I had to laugh.  Some stuffed suit was driving a very nice Volvo, I didn't catch the model but it was of the sportier type.  This little boy of a man did not know how to use that car right.  He slowed down this fine $40k car to less then 10mph getting on the highway, I almost became part of his trunk.  My little $14K car is not set up like his car to corner, and I usually do 30 on that ramp.  I got stuck behind this guy for a few miles on the highway he was doing over 80 on the straight-aways, but he slowed down to under 60 on the curves.  What a fine waste of machinery.  I for some reason have gotten my love of speed back.  It is funny how I am more brave now than when I was a man, and how I seem to be a little more of an adrenaline junkie now.  I skate faster, I drive faster, I love to take risks too.  I guess there are some benefits to going through this.  I have to go work on my blanket, sorry to bore you guys. Going back to work after being off almost two months has been hard on me, not to mention being stuck in an office all day.  I am the type that needs to be out, to be free.  I love to drive around, soak up the sun, and talk to lots of different people.  Sales is my life, I can't wait to get it back.  I am preparing to meet my old customers, and how they handle this, it should be fun.  Good nite, love to you all.

       Blogging with breakfast...  I have to be quick this am.  Not much to say other than hello to all you new folks who have shown up all of sudden, thank you for reading my little blog.  Also check out a new site from a younger trans friend (boy dyke link on the right).  I think doing this while a young person these days is brave, I was never brave enough to do that myself, which leads me to my main topic this morning.        Insomnia..  I am back into not sleeping much mode.  I think it has to do with allot of different factors: my sore tooth, excitement from finally living and working full time,confusion over both my sexuality,and the status of me and co.  The biggest thing I think keeping me up is different factors of guilt.    I hate being a recovering catholic, I feel guilty over good stuff I should be elated about.  I feel guilty I get to transition while others don't, I feel guilty I have an easier time passing then most, I feel guilty I am doing well with things while others struggle.  Most of my guilt comes from my feelings for my family.  I feel guilty for denying Co her husband and my kids their dad, I love them all deeply and want to still be there for them, just not as a guy.  I also feel guilty for failing.  Not too many of you will understand this I think, I am in the minority on this one.  I feel guilty sometimes for not being able to overcome being trans and just stayed a man.  It is  hard to explain it, I have known about my trans issues since 4.  I went into my relationship with Co, with every intent to live through it, or suck it up and get over it.  She did know about this by the way before we were married, she just thought it went away.  I had every intention of beating this, I wasn't just biding time, I really wanted to succeed.  Who the fuck wants to be like this?  Nobody goes through this for fun, but I set a task for myself, and I failed to accomplish it.  I still love Co very much, and I feel for her.  Sometimes I feel that I am moving faster and faster ahead, while she is stuck behind.  I am sorry to go on, these feelings of guilt come and go.  Co has told me maybe I should go talk to Sterner about it, but they come and go, if they become constant I will.  Counseling is good for tough stuff, just not the easy shit.  I will eventually learn to deal with this shit, it is my stupid cross which I choose to bear.  Yankees on the TV this am, I still love baseball, sports is my biggest guilty pleasure from my old male life.  I have been a Yankee fan since my dad took me to a game fathers day 1976.  Back then it was bat day.  Who the hell thought it would be a good idea to give a bunch of drunk New Yorkers weapons?  I think I got Ray White, I believe he was a utility player or outfielder,not a big star.  Finally I am so glad I don't live in Mass., those asholes up there just change the rules when the game isn't going their own way.  The law makers should be so ashamed of themselves.  At the same time though civil unions are a good step, and I would have thought them a victory and a stepping stone towards marriage.  But, since they decided to do it by a constitutional amendment outlawing marriage it sucks.  I will post again tonite, time to go get pretty.   Take care, Love you all.

       Ok I am pissed...  I had written another long Blog when power dipped and erased it. I am very tired but I will try to piece it together again. Oh and sorry to anyone who took my rhetorical blog as insulting or anything, please read my comment.  I won't apologize for what I said, I am sorry if it was taken badly, I am still getting adjusted to my new skin, and all that accompanies it.   First day  All was cool today, I forgot how much I missed work. I know I will sicken some of you, but I love to work, must be the protestant in me.  I love selling pet products so much, I sometimes feel guilty getting paid to do it.  I don't even mind the nasty people you meet every now and then, I look to them as a challenge to overcome, not run from.  So like I said it was cool, started learning the computer programs they use and how they do stuff.  We are going to go over products and stuff tomorrow, hope to be on the road again late this week or early next.  Look out.  I also got to punch my boss at his request. I have know him since I was 16 or as I like to say"since I had hair the first time."  He felt bad after his second slip of the morning and asked me to hit him if he did it again.  He used a wrong pronoun, so I punched him in the arm, not full force of course, he laughed and said sorry. He is about to get his black belt in Twi Kwan Do, so best not to piss him off.   It is so cool he is comfortable enough to be so open about stuff.  I also asked him at lunch if he had told the others in our company, he did.  Nobody had a problem with it when he told them, and they were very nice to me today, so it is cool.  While I love the fact I don't have to worry about being found out latter, I don't like having others know too much about me.  I love to share with all you guys, but it is my sharing not some one else sharing my life.   We also had a customer come in to pick up an order today that I knew I had called on but couldn't remember his name or store.  Al introduced us and said" Paul this is Ashley,  have you met her?"  Paul actually responded" yes, she used to call on my awhile back."  Wow, I don't know whether to be happy he remembers me as a woman, or sad that I made such a poor impact on him as a man he doesn't remember me.  It was cool though, I wonder how many of my old customers will remember me as Ash instead of Scooter.   Remember when  While driving to work this morning I traveled a road I have not been on since my days of attending CCSU.  The days were I was  young and dumb and full of cum.  (wow now there's a statement that gets a total different reaction from those of you who only know me as Ashley) well ok not cum, but definitely testosterone filled.  I was so angry with the world.  I hated every one, even God, and especially myself.  I don't think I had a true deathwish, but not that far off.  I used to drive fast.  I loved to race and my favorite spot to race was this stretch of highway.  I reguarly used to get my car up to 120, I had more left under the hood, but my speedometer had a pin at 120 and I didn't dare push it past.  I don't look like the type now but I always loved big powerful fact cars.  In the 80's those muscle cars of the 70's were cheap to buy, and I had little money.  My two favorite were my Pontiac Grand Le Mans which was the 120mph car, and my old 77ish Cadillac aka the Ghettomobile.  My caddy was fugly, turquoise green with a white vinyl top, but who cares when you have a back seat big enough to sleep in when you don't have a place to sleep for the night, and you have a 454 cu in engine under the hood.  That baby flew, you could steer it with one finger, and it had an eight track too.  Both cars were lost prematurely in accidents one not my fault, the other not sure what happened other than the friend I lent it to wasn't used to a 454.  He wrapped that sucker dead center around a pole, lucky he was ok.  Little old me actually put that bitch  back together. Had to replace the condersor, radiator, alternator, water pump, alternator, main pulley,timing chain, bumper and hood.  I am not just a domestic goddess, I can get dirty too.  Unfortunately they stopped making cars you could work on yourself back in the late 70's early 80's, now I don't even try.  Some day I want to try and restore a 70's Caddy, this time a prettier one.   New geographies  Trying to get used to my new hub of action.  So much seems to be happening for me in the Hartford area.  I have an old friend who lives in Hartford, a new friend who lives there too.  I used to play softball in East Hartford too.  But other than going to one of Kev's parties,playing softball, or going to the Civic Center I never hung around Hartford much.  I remember all the concerts I used to go to when I was younger, and I was too stupid to realize that if I spent money less and saved more I would be a happier person.  I have a very eclectic taste, and I have enjoyed concerts from Billy Joel to TOOL, Aerosmith to Posion and many more.  Not to mention those days of suffering with the Whalers when my dad would get some free tickets from work.  Now I go to support group in Hartford, and my office is near the line in West Hartford.  I will have to learn what is around me in that area.  I believe their is a rail trail in Farmington, maybe I can hit that one after one of my office days or something.  It will be cool to be closer to some things,  I will have to try and meet Kev for lunch one day in town, he hasn't met his old team mate en femme yet, should be interesting.  Oh well better go before power blips again.  Saw a post on a friends site about the immortality of youth, struck very close to home.  I will have to share another time about my other deathwishes, since I touched briefly on my love for speed I had, and still feel at times. I am so glad I didn't accomplish what I was trying to do back then.  Sometimes it is better to fail.  Goodnite all. Love ya, take care.

       Pissed off to all hell...  Ok I thought I was going to get away from this computer today, that was until I went to check my Yahoo account.  For the SECOND TIME since January those idiots disconnected my account.  I have enough email addresses but, I use the yahoo account to do my on-line support groups.  I also used it for some friends I had on those boards and such.  I don't know why they love to pick on little ole me, but I would love to hold the balls of the guy responsible for it and just squeeze.   I found some old stuff while doing some spring cleaning.  I actually found my journal I started around the time I told Co and first contacted the clinic.  I was brought to tears by some of stuff I wrote.  It is so good how things have changed for the better since I told Co that cold November night in '02.  At one time she didn't even want me around the kids as a female.  Thank God she changed her mind.   I also found where I weighed the pluses and minuses of how and where to tell her, and what our options were.  I will share them someday after the wounds have healed over a little bit more.  I also found two poems, 1 cute, 1 very dark very sad.  I have to share how I felt back then, both silly and overly serious.  I hope you guys don't get freaked out by how I can be sickly sweet, or really dark.  I assure you I am not bi-polar, I am merely an emotional person.  This just magnifies things on me, and I am very comfortable with both volatile places.  Enjoy them.  Ok first one very silly, wrote this one during lunch the day I had my first appointment with Doc P( my endroconlogist).  They can give me a pill    They can give me a pill That gives me a woody. Not my first choice, But an oldie and goodie.  They can give me a pill, That regrows my hair. So the few that I have, Aren't so lonely up there.  They can give me a pill, That makes me grow breasts. But I'm sure in the end, They'll sag like the rest.  They can give me a pill, That makes me not smoke. Me without nicotine, Now there's a good joke.  They can give me a pill, To make me less blue. But they don't have a pill, That will make me forget you.   Ok second one I wrote after Co had a reversal of her original change of heart on the status of us.  In plain English she decided she couldn't handle living a lesbian life after thinking she could.  I don't blame her one bit, we all have to be happy with our own lives.  I can say without doubt this poem best says how I felt after it hit me that I would be losing a very special relationship, even though she is still my best friend.  NUMB..    This lack of feeling is scary, I feel nothing, I am numb. I fear nothing, I am numb.  My feelings are gone, Of emotions gone wrong. I am numb.  Did my brain fry out? Or am I just cried out? I don't know how to feel, I don't know how to deal. I am numb.  I feel not the surrounding cold, Here in the blackness of my soul. I feel not the heat of the sun, As the air and myself feel as one. I am numb.  I look not to the future, Or dwell in the past. Nor do I care if this very moment, Is my moment last. I am numb.  How did I get like this? I do not know. Did something inside, Crack, Break, Or  Blow?  There is no way, I can truly explain.   The lack of all feeling, Inside of my brain. No way to cope, But I still will keep hope.  I am numb. Neither glad or depressed. I am numb. No feelings to express. I am numb. No direction to head. I am numb. At least I'm not dead.  I am numb.

       Dis, dat and de udder things..  Not much big going on this weekend, just a whole lot of little shit.  Lots of changed plans, and little cool shit too.  Poor Co succumbed to a stomach bug yesterday, we were on the way to take the kids to the movies when we had to turn back.  Funny we turned around in the driveway of where the COS banquet was just last week.  The flash backs were interesting.  I also got cancelled for pictures today, too cloudy for outside pics.  I also have decided that it might be a good idea to take some inside of me being Ms. Domestic working on my blanket.  Tried to invite mom over for lunch today, but my little bro already made plans with her.  I had forgotten to invite her on Friday, and she made plans, oh well, she'll come over someday.  I have been living here since early last fall, and due to Paul being so sick she still hasn't seen my apartment.  Before Co got sick we went over to Filene's to grab a few more things for my wardrobe.  I used to think they were so expensive, that was before I learned to shop them during big sales and clearance times.  I even lucked out while in the dressing room I found a really cute outfit someone else didn't like, and it was just the right size for me.  I think Co got sick from the cheese filled pretzel bites I bought for her on the way out.  I had one, and they were nasty.  I also wanted to kill my daughter in Filene's.  I had to take my daughter to the restroom and on the way back to Co I stopped to look at some jeans.  I then pulled out my phone to find Co.  My daughter sees me pull out the phone and asks"is that a new phone maddie?"  I explained to her no its the same old phone without the pleather case.  So she pipes back with " oh from when you were a boy?"  I quickly and quietly corrected her "no honey when I was a girl."  She goes on enraging me with " you were never a girl, you were a boy..."  I just gave up told her to be quiet and moved on to find Co myself.  I am sure a few people over heard us, and I loved the points and giggles.  Outted by my own kid, how fucking nice is that?  We talked on the way home in the car, and I explained to her how much she could have gotten me in trouble if she kept that up.  She sweetly apologized and really tried to kiss my ass the rest of the day.  Several times she referred to when  maddie was a little girl.   My favorite was when a my pretty pony commercial came on, she immediately asks"did you like my pretty pony when you were a little girl maddie?"  I told her I did, which is a little more than half true I have to admit.  On the front of a bunch of good or funny shit going on it was an interesting weekend.  I have been so upset by a recent regrowth of facial hair I know it is just the growth cycle of hair, but it is so depressing to wake up scruffy.  While putting on my special ointment I got from my black market source I noticed something funny.  The femising estrogen ointment I am using is made in Italy, maybe that is why I am growing hair again, most Italian women I know have facial hair so it could be.  Sorry for joking about my Italian friends.  I also notice a really cool thing last night, cleavage.  I am finally starting to get some of my own, its not much but hey its more than I had before.  I also remembered that not only is tomorrow my first day of work it is the one year anniversary of me quitting smoking.  I never thought I would be able to quit, but when doc P told me that if I continued to smoke he wouldn't prescribe hormones I quit very easily. I actually quit smoking before going before the board, that was the hardest day of the time.  I had replaced smoking with gummy bears and I think I ate a whole bag that day and evening as I fretted my future.  I was so afraid that they were going to tell me no, and I would have to either do it by myself, obviously I had nothing to worry about.  I equated it afterwards to a tea party, I had been prepared for a whole deposition type meeting.  I am sure approval for surgery won't be as easy, it will be another nerveracking time for me.    I am scared to death about starting work tomorrow, at first I thought it would be good to  get back to work.   That was before I realized it's not going   back  to work  its my first day of work as a woman.    I am humbled and elated at the same time. I can't help but think back to my first real job.  I actually worked for Fotomat, remember those little boxes of glass and tinfoil that littered shopping plazas at one time.  Well I worked in several for about 4 years.  I think it is my working in that little coffin that made me a little uncomfy with tight spaces.  Oh and if you were wondering, yes we did look at your pictures, some of you should really be ashamed of yourselves, others I wished I saved their phone numbers they were doing some stuff I would love to try.   I have a hard road ahead of me going back to my old field, but I should be ok in time.  I am also elated since I am finally starting to live my dream.  I don't have all the equipment yet, but I am going to be working out there as a woman.  I already love how I have been able to live as a woman, now I get to work as a woman.  I need to figure out when I can start bartender school so I can get the second job and get moving towards my goal.  It is nice to have a plan, but it is worthless if you don't use it.  I am also thinking of maybe picking the 29th of March as a date, its my anniversary of being off death sticks, my first day working as Ash, why not add a third thing on that date?  Hopefully Dr. Bowers will get caught up with her work soon and get back to me so I can set the date.  I have come far but I have to keep going so I don't fall behind.  I equate it to those last thousand feet on Everest.  I am tired and dazed from the climb up here, but I am too close to stop now, and if I stay too long I won't make it ever.  I have to go get a few things for work.  I found a place that does Pop shop soda the other day, I have to go back and get some more.  I grew up on that shit, and I haven't been able to find it for a long time.  Co's birthday is in a few weeks I think I will take her to Avery's soda in New Britain to get some of their good stuff too. She really can't do sugar and if I remember they have a wide selection of diet stuff.  Have fun, enjoy the day, I will not post till late tomorrow I have my last 2 hour marathon with Suzanne after work, I am going back to an hour once a week to give my face and my wallet a break.  Take care and love you all.

       Kind,oblivious people...  All went well with Mom at the lawyers, she should be ok.  It is sad the kids are trying to force her out of something that is rightfully hers.  I know that they never forgave their dad for leaving their mom, and not being there for them as kids, but my mom had nothing to do with that.  My mom took care of him when his kids abandoned him, my mom saw the beauty, in the beast that most people saw.  Paul was not an angel nor a friendly guy, but if one invested a little time there was a wonderful person inside.  I myself had trouble with that ruff and gruff outside which kept me back a little, but I also saw glimpses of what my mom saw.  I think that I get my gift of being able to deal with difficult people from her.  I was always the one who took care of the most nasty and difficult people at my last job.  I am pretty good, not great, at getting along with all kinds of people.  I have lost some people since I try to see all sides of things, and to be all things to all people.  Some folks see things in such polarities I tend to piss them off with my soft stand on most issues in conversation.  I assure you though I do have very firm opinions on stuff, I have just found it better to discuss things peacefully and fully instead of just arguing about them from a hard position.  Hard positions just usually make the other persons position grow harder.  Mom also doesn't like my hair.  She keeps offering suggestions, and trying to help.  It is so sweet how my mom wants to help me with my looks, but her idea of good looking hair brings out my strong male jaw and forehead.  If I went with her look, I might as well put a sign on,  Transsexual   on my large forehead.  My hair looks the way it does on purpose.  I need it to cover things, to offset others.  It took a long time to find the right look, yes it looks a little windblown at times, but that helps me look more real instead of too perfect.  I know that real women aren't perfect, and those that look too good attract attention, which I don't want.  I already turn heads with my height and my deceiving figure.  I had an ex-coworker say she thought I was a size 6 the other day, I loved it, considering I was in a size 10 pair of cords.  Oh yeah, the title.  Last night co and I took the kids shopping.  I love how being unemployed has brought out the frugal shopper in me again.  We went to the bakery outlet in town to get some rolls and them something sweet to snack on, since I don't buy that stuff for me, and a couple other places.  We divided the kids as usual, I took my daughter, co took my son.  My daughter and I got to the check out and she in her antsy way started playing around and me being the good parent asked her to please stop.  My daughter asked"why ?" The cashier pipes in to her"honey your mommy doesn't want to see you get hurt."  OMG, I never call myself their mom, I am their  maddie , Co is their mom.  But it was so cool to have someone mistake me as her mom.  I went in solo to CVS after to get some neosporin to help with the face.  While cutting through the makeup isle I was stopped by an older gentleman.  "Excuse me ma'am, which one of these dry faster?" he asked as he held up two kinds of nail polish.  I smirked and then pointed out the one labeled speed drying.  I don't know which one dries faster, and the old me would have just told him I don't work here.  I just enjoyed too much that some poor guy, with eyesight bad enough to miss my adams apple and marked up face asked me a girl question.  It is nice every once in a while to be thrown a bone.  I won't get into too much here, I am the type to kiss and tell, but I also again need to save some details for the book.  Last night was awesome, and I swear to God there are times where I can pick up the energy Co emits while she orgasms.  I cannot get there myself anymore, so I relish being able to feel some of hers.  I don't care if you call me crazy, or if I am.  That is a cool feeling, and I cannot wait to experience it fully, myself someday.  We might try to take the kids to movies today, its my off week for twenty.  Co is also hooking up with a support group I found on metroline for her, so it might screw up my schedule more.  She though needs more help on this journey than I do right now.  I have a direction, a purpose, a goal.  She is still trying to figure out how to put back together the life I shattered on her 1 1/2 years ago.  Also talked to my new boss, he started with the wrong pronouns and then apologized.  I joked back" hey it's ok Al, you've got a three week probation, after that I start smacking you upside your head."  He joked back that he might need it.  Sorry for the long post, I most likely won't be back till sometime tomorrow afternoon.  I am supposed to do photos with Tasha from PFLAG in the am on Sunday, but it looks like mother nature has other plans.  Take care, love you all.

       A hard 6 1/2 inches...  Ok so hormones don't make the perverted sense of humor go away.  I am not writing about a penis though, but how much work I did on my blanket yesterday.  I am trying to get as much done on the blanket before I get back to work and just wanted to see how much I could do in a day.  To those of you who don't know crocheting is a long arduous process.  My blanket is about queen size in width, I am still a novice at it,  I only taught myself how to do it on New years eve,  and it is a tight stitch.  It takes between an average of 90 to 110 minutes per inch of length, that 6 1/2 inches took me roughly  10+ hours to do yesterday.  My wrists and fingers are so sore right now, but this is just not about the blanket.  I will be able to look back at that section of my blanket while recovering and remember how I kept going for all those hours and just worked through the fatigue and the discomfort.  I have a feeling I will need a reminder of both my determination and stamina while recovering.  Even the bravest and those with more fortitude than I have been humbled by this surgery.  I have been through 3 surgeries before, but none this serious.  The first was to set and wire my mouth shut,  hmmm ok don't get any ideas  after I broke it as a kid.  I also have had 2 knee operations and I was back to work within 3 days both times.  None of those experiences were easy to go through, but I don't doubt for 1 second SRS is tougher.  I am looking forward to finding out though.  I also got a chuckle going to bed last night when it hit me that the length of my blanket is close to another old dimension of mine.  I had to stop using the Climara patch all together.  I was trying to cut down the damage to my system by replacing some of the pills I was taking with the patch.  I guess my showers are a little too long, and too hot for the patch.  They tend to only last 4-5 days before they start to bubble, get moisture in them, and turn rashy.  I also noticed my weight jumped up 2lbs since I started them, so even more reason to get off of them.  I haven't heard anything back from my blood work which is usually a good sign so I will just go back to the pills.  I hate to sound so non-challant with my meds, but I assure you I have done hundreds of hours of research on them, and I discuss things with my doctor.  Yes I am changing my meds around on my own, but only after discussing options w/doc P, and his assistant.   I will admit though I did self medicate before even going to the board, I don't like to talk about that time much.  I really could have screwed my body up, or even worse killed myself by accident.    I need to go work on my blanket some more before going to lend my support for mom at the lawyers office, and then I have to get my ass home to get ready for my kids and co.  I am making my new favorite, bbq stir fry.  I use pork and chicken and marinate it in bbq sauce before stir frying it.  I don't eat a whole lot of meat anymore, I am trying to wean myself off of it, but it is going to take awhile.  If you are going to have it, you might as well make something yummy, and pork and chicken are so much healthier than the red meat I used to eat daily. Ok gotta go, take care and love to all.

       Looking through some stuff...  I was thinking about one of the books I plan to write while working on my blanket.  I was playing with the story line a little.  This is the only one of the three that I have planned and partially started that is fiction.  I took a break from crocheting to look for the disk with the work I had so far on that book.  While looking for it I found this poem.  I wrote in only a few weeks back, but never shared it.  It was one of those that came during that week or two of creative explosion, when I was writing 4-6 poems a day.  It is about how I write, not from the head, but from the heart instead.  It is a little conceited, like its author, but hey who's perfect. Enjoy.  My Process     I feel, I love, I hurt, I weep, I rejoice, I reminisce, I share. I let my feelings grow, Grow into words, Words of their own. I take my words, And place them together to form ideas. Ideas that take shape, Ideas that take hold. Ideas that grow into emotions, And start the process again. Emotions grow into poems, I gather them up into packages, And then set them free. To be off on their own, To spread their emotion. To spark other's feelings, So that they feel their own feelings, They feel more, They love more, They hurt more, They weep more, They rejoice more, They reminisce more, They share more.

       Other stuff...  I was just reading the Courant and saw the circus is coming to town.  I used to love the circus as a kid, the clowns the music, the acrobats and the exotic animals.  That was when I was young, innocent and really naive though, before enlightenment.  I have two youngins or kidlets as a friend calls them, they are still very much still in the innocent time, and so cute.  I was able to talk to my daughter a few months back in my highest falsetto and made her think she was having a conversation with the tooth fairy.  My daughter has in the past asked to go to the circus and I have always been able to be busy or put it off to next year.  I cannot  bring myself to give any money or support to something that brutalizes animals like that.  I am no animal activist, I love to eat meat in moderation, I even take premarin because I get wicked insomnia from just doing the synthetics.  I just cant stand to support animals suffering for entertainment purposes. I could go on for days on animal cruelty and the pluses and minuses of eating meat and all that stuff on animal testing but I won't, not today.   I don't know how to break it to my daughter.  I don't want to kill her innocence, but I feel guilty for just blowing it off.  I don't want to give her a complex, she has already "lost" her daddy.  I am trying extra hard to make sure I didn't scar her for life, the relationship between a little girl and her daddy is a special one, I sit and cry every now and then for denying her of that.  OK, composure.  So this weekend Co and I will talk over how to deal with the whole circus issue.  I would love to take her to that animal free circus, but I don't think it comes close enough to go to, kids get antsy on long rides.  On a brighter note, I will be taking both my kids fishing in three weeks.  I love it, we use barbless hooks as to do as little damage as possible.  We have yet to catch anything on opening day, but its not about catching fish, its about bonding while out in nature.  I used to love going fishing with my dad, those are some of my fondest memories of my otherwise sad childhood.  Those times were special I forgot the troubles of my life and just enjoyed spending time with dad, and with nature.  I am sorry I can't be the  great man he tried to teach me to be, but I am trying to be the great woman I am supposed to be.  I have to go with mom tomorrow to the lawyers office, I had planned to go skate, but family comes first.  I hate being looked to as the smart one in the family.  I don't know why they think I am so much smarter than my siblings, they both have college degrees while I took the school of life approach.  All three of us have learning disabilities my siblings stayed back because of theirs, I worked through mine.  I hate to sound like super girl but I have found you can accomplish so many things that others say you cannot just by believing in yourself and hard work.  These are the lessons I learned in my childhood that I have used all my life.  I have not had an easy life.  I spent the last 2 or 3 years as a man with privledge, but I earned my privledge.  I worked for over 10 years doing all sorts of stuff, from loading/unloading trucks,being a warehouse worker/cashier,  running a retail store,all for minimum wage.  I had times where I had no car and walked, rode my bike or caught a ride to work.  Rides were hard to get, and the walk took over 3 hours, oh did I mention it was roughly 10 miles away. When I say I was hungry, I am not just talking about food, I had little money, no hope of transition, but I kept going.  I grew strength and determination from that job that helped me succeed in my next job. Yes, I was given a few breaks because I was a man, but you don't stay long if you don't do a good job, and I kept moving up.  I didn't achieve privledge until about 2 years into my last job, that was when my boss decided to pay us on growth.  I worked so hard those last two years, but I had too.  I had to pay for my transition somehow, not to mention care for co, the kids, buy a house all that suburban white boy stuff.  I have spent well over $10g's so far between hormones, testing, dental work, laser and electro, but I earned each and every dollar.  With every dollar I spend now I think back to that poor young man with holes in his jeans, worn through boots, ragged flannel jacket, and his dream.  I am the lucky sob who now gets to live this dream and it is because I was him I am here.  I truly am very proud of my life and the fact I am a self made man err woman.  I am sorry for being so emotional today, I had intended to just write about the circus, but my heart had more to add.  I hope I don't come across with too much martyrdom, but I am not looking for sympathy for the hard path I took to get here.  I am merely sharing my story for those who are thinking they cannot do in this life so that they can see you can.  I have to get off my soapbox now, and get back to crocheting my blanket.  Take care, Love to all.

       I forgot the best part...  On my ride home I decided to check in with my ex sales buddy Bill.  Bill just happened to be riding with an old manufacturers rep associate of mine.  We got to talking about my new job, and they started spouting off suggestions if the job didn't work out.  It turned quickly into picking on me in a good spirited way, and if one doesn't have wit, thick skin, and a sense of humor in this journey it is a much harder one.  The manufacturer's rep then pipes up  " hey you could always go to work for Purbec, he likes his women young."   I being the well witted smartass that I am piped back to him  "Denny, I am sure Dave likes his women to have  vagina's  too..."   I thought they were going to drive off the road in laughter.

       So much in so short a time...  Wow so much happened today.  I haven't had this much action in the last three weeks, that I had today.  I also am in one of those philosophical self assessment type moods.  I am feeling a little liberal and in the mood to save the world also.  I will break it up into the major parts of today's happenings for you.  I apologize in advance for its length.  Blood work..  Well I forgot that I haven't changed my name for insurance yet.  I got to the lab and while waiting noticed the blood work order was for Scott(ok so now you know) along with the name on my insurance card.  I thought about what my new dear friend recently told me about being stealth, just be "don't ask don't tell" about it.  You know don't volunteer information if you don't need to.  I combine that with my confidence in my belonging it seems to work.  I have learned so much so fast from this friend I won't ever be able to repay her, Thanks Jude. So anyway I just walked in and acted like nothing was wrong, that Scott was my girl name, and I wasn't uncomfortable with it.  She looked at me, looked at the name on the order and got a puzzled look on her face.  She thought she was going to catch me and asked snottily asked for my insurance card.  I provided it proudly with no delay.  She got a little smirk on her face and kept going.  She printed up the hippa form and the form that I would pay if insurance denied it, and asked" make sure the name is right on it."  I replied again with confidence "yes its right" and signed my old name. I am pretty sure she was on to me, but she was kind enough not to question me.  I have only ever met one girl with the name of Scott, and she got teased allot.  But if you can go into a situation clear headed, friendly, and confident enough not to seem suspicious you can do many things that are hard.  I had prepared myself for confrontation when I first noticed it, but then I thought of my past successes using kindness instead of aggressiveness and it worked as usual.   Unemployment..  Had to go to a class on finding a job at unemployment in New Britain to get paid some benefits.  I hate jumping through hoops, almost as much as I hate collecting unemployment, but it beats the alternative.  I was blown away when they explained the class purpose to us.  Our instructor explained that we were chosen because we were shown in our profiles to be the canidates MOST LIKELY to be able/desirable to get a job.  I got pissed very fast.  Why in the world would you take specifically the group most likely to get a job and devote time,money and energy into them?  Wouldn't it make more sense to take the group least likely to get a job and train them with valuable skills, and how to get a job to begin with?  I don't get people sometimes.  If we just spent a few extra dollars in real world job training, helped more people open businesses, and helped society from the bottom up we could save so much money on things like drug prevention, crime fighting, welfare, domestic abuse and on and on.  Do you really think a kid growing up thinks "Yeah I want to be a drug dealer, I want to end up shot up and dead at 20"?  Of course they don't, but like many others in this world you do what it takes to survive, even if that means selling drugs or yourself to just keep living.  I wish we could fix these problems instead of going through the motions fixing imaginary problems, and pretending to make a difference.  Boston..  I had to go up to Boston today to see my old pals at work, console an old friend, pay my insurance premium, and see if I could see my boss.  I start work next Monday, so this was one of my last opportunities of free time for a bit.  For those of you not lucky enough to be familiar with the drive to Boston, it is not an easy ride.  All along the Pike and 95, turn signals are optional, and they become less and less used the closer you get to the city.  Also optional are obeying the traffic laws, you can pass in any lane, and the speed limit is actually the minimum speed you need to travel if you don't wish to become roadkill.  I really also wish to thank  the idiot who thought it would be a great idea to use breakdown lanes as travel lanes.  I came within inches of getting killed going up there over 4 years ago by someone doing 80 in that lane as I attempted to exit 95.  So I get up to the office, and directly across from the front door is the conference room.  As I was coming in the glass door my old boss was coming out of the conference room.  Immediately we made eye contact, he looked puzzled not knowing who I was and just before he broke off eye contact I gave him my patented  shit eating grin , (the best 5 g's I've spent, so far).  I saw the fuse light in his brain, as I came in the inner door he kept walking and got about 10 feet away before the bomb went off in his head.  He didn't recognize me at first but in those ten feet it clicked.  He turned around smiled, shook my hand, and we talked for about 15 minutes.  It was cool,  I knew deep down he would eventually be cool with things, I just wish he had gotten cool with it before he "protected me" by giving me an escape route out of my job.  I have said it before, and I will say it again, I am not mad at him for doing it, I am mad at myself for taking it.  I also was unrecognized by several of my old coworkers.  It was a very good visit.  Talked for a while with all the old characters, made plans for the Boston gay pride event in May(?).  I can't wait, my brother Shawn and I had already made plans to go, now I have some locals to go with too.  I also got the usual "you look good".  Now I really do appreciate it, and they are truly kind.  I just have issues with compliments after living a life of self hate.  I also look to much into compliments, like   what was I that ugly before?   Self assessment, and questioning..  I have been changing my opinions on so much these last 4 or 5 months.  Before I was a staunch conservative.  Now after being so broke and discriminated against, I have dropped that view.  Conservatives as a group are clueless in the hardships of others, they tend to follow instead of lead, and they don't even realize how small minded and heartless they are.  I find it amazing how many opportunities I lost once the job process reached the background check and they found that "m" and the rest of my background.  I can't prove definitely that is what happened, but with every job I pursued that did not do the indepth background check I had a job offer, not a good one, but an offer the same.  It just seems too convienate to be anything else to me.  I got this great idea while sitting in the unemployment class today.  They have special help if you are disabled, if you are a veteran, and such.  Why don't they have someone who works with people in the GLBT community?  Now being gay, lesbian or bi, usually doesn't show up like being T does(that's why we face so much violence), but they all get discriminated against and lose jobs and opportunities.  Just think about something as benign as a holiday office party, how much grief could one face for bringing your partner?  Why shouldn't they be allowed to just be themselves and  not fear ridicule and retribution?  There has to be a way to compile lists of companies with GLBT friendly policies and help those who wish extra help from that community to get jobs with those companies.  This is my new objective for after surgery, once I have that obstacle out of the way, I will have find something new to channel my drive into.  My life doesn't end with surgery(I hope), so I need to start looking past that magical date and plan for the next leg of my journey.  If I can budget it right maybe I should start laying the ground work now for it.  I am going to do some research to see what it would take to get the funding, to get the support, and how to make it happen. I also have been on a quest to figure out my sexuality lately, funny since I have been almost celibate and non active for quite a while.  My only action has been  golden rule sex,  you know do onto others as you would like done to you.  Co has been great and not complaining, so I have been lucky.  The only unfortunate thing is that she isn't into what I am becoming, but she is still here, so who knows.  I have been evaluating what I find both attractive physically and desire personality wise in my next mate.  On a carnal level I am lost, I still find women very attractive, yet I am curious about certain types of men.  Carnal isn't what builds relationships though. It is interesting though to see what kind of gals I am attracted to.  I am not like some I know physically attracted to "butches", I prefer gals who are a blur or a blend on the gender scale,but towards the classic ideal, attractive yet tall, or athletic, maybe attractive yet not into that image, just not fitting the classic idea of the ideal gal next door.  I just don't get that into butches though, they are too far over on that scale for me, but like I said that is on the carnal level.  I of course also love the overly glamorous type, the blonde or redhead and beautiful type.    As far as personality goes though it is a different story.  I have always gotten along better with women then men, which isn't surprising since I have been one mentally since I can remember.  I was in the inner circle with men, and enjoyed the camaraderie and the sense of teamwork.  That is gone now though, I am cast away to outside that tribe and I cannot go back, not that I want to, but that was the relationship that worked best for me with men, team mate.  Now as a woman that same type of relation in an amorous type of way does not work.  So while I may be attracted to some guys out there, I really don't see anything lasting long.  Maybe if I don't like the lesbian lifestyle I may look to the ftm community for a relationship.   I don't know if I would ever look for a relationship in the mtf community, but you never know, things have a way of happening. Binary is not always the best way.  Colors and races have already started to blend and blur, gender is next.   Looking back at my longest and most fulfilling relationship, Co and I, I am starting to see a trend in what I do like in a person, be they genetic man, woman or achieved their gender latter in life.  Co has some really desirable personality traits for me, she is emotionally strong, and convicted in her beliefs.  She is aggressive in handling life's adversities, she is not afraid to be true to herself, and proud of who she is.  I equate these qualities to what has been deemed more male then female. Yet she has so many female qualities too.   I may not be describing her qualities that well since it has been a long day, but she has always attracted me with her inner maleness.  She is not a lesbian, nor does she have gender issues, and let me assure you she is beautiful , attractive and very feminine.  But I cannot help but think it is these qualities that are different than the norm that kept me after the carnal attracted me.  She fufills my shortfalls, I fulfill hers, that is why we are soul mates we are the perfect fit personality wise, but soon we won't be on a physical way.  I really think I will find some of those same qualities I love so much in her in that lesbian community I have always gotten along with so well.  I know she and I can't go on, and I am not really looking to do anything until after surgery.  It will be an interesting self imposed celibacy, I hope I don't go nuts in the mean time.  Over time I will find someone else, I won't ever be lucky enough to enjoy the same connection I have/had with co, but I know I have enough love in my heart for someone else once the scars have healed.

       Tell me about yur mutter...  Wow if I were around in the time of Freud he would have no time for anyone else but me sometimes.  I don't know if it was the resse's before bed to quell the pain of electro, or the conversation I had with Mom before going to sleep, but I had a weird dream even by my standards.  To give background Mom called me to say Paul's kids are already trying to cause trouble by trying to get the house from her, even though her name is on the deed in survivorship, heavy disheartening talk before bedtime.  I feel bad, but it is hard to reach people as greedy as his kids.  Also I am sure this dream was partly inspired by a guest on gender talk who talked about a theory that both God and Adam were hemaphrodites and he split Adam into two beings 1 male 1 female so they could be company for each other.  It one of those theorys that seem to make so much sense I feel stupid for not thinking of it.  The dream..  I don't remember how it happened or witnessed the actual split but somehow I split into two different people much like the theory on gender talk.  But S**** was a separate entity from Ash, and I was living my life while Co was happily living with my old male form.  Well something, and I don't know what happened to poor S**** and he died.  So me being the good friend and having a close personal tie to the guy  attend the funeral.  What a weird feeling to be separate from a self you have been all your life, and to see that old self laying lifeless in a coffin.  It was nice to see it was well attended, at least I was loved.  It was hard though because many of the people from my old life were there mourning the loss of S**** and treating me almost like I didn't exist.  HMMMM a theme?  During the dream though I was so upset with Co because she was burying the old me in a suit, I hated suits, and we had always talked that I would be buried with my old hockey jersey on.  I guess the new old me felt different than I did.   This was both a disturbing and enlightening dream.  While on the surface it was visually disturbing, looking deeper it is how I had been feeling in life.  I have felt like I did indeed die, and so many more people liked me as a man, than can handle me as a woman.  I am not that overly concerned about it any longer, those who are worth having in my life will eventually come around or are here now after a few months time.  Not every one will come along, some will wear black for a very long time. I hope they don't mind while they cry tears of sorrow I am crying tears of joy with each and every victory.  Yes some of the old me is dead, and I feel a little more free of that old bondage and try to throw another shovel load of dirt on that coffin every day.  I hope I can take all the good from my old self and mix it up with achieving my full potential in my new life.   I better go, I have to do a cholesterol test that I am fasting for, then I have to go jump through a hoop at unemployment to get some past money due to me.  And then I am heading to Boston to say goodbye.  I will try to fill you in tonight.  Take care, don't eat peanut butter eggs before bed, and Love to all.

       Early goodnite...  I am posting my nightly edition now even though its not even 4 yet.  I have a two hour marathon session with the lovely Suzanne tonight at 5, so I won't be back on.  I will make this short since I need to go make supper before I go.  Man I am such an old lady lately.  I spent most of the banquet just people watching, I live alone with a cat, and I have been working like mad to crochet a blanket. Now I am eating supper at 4pm,  I should just go get the knee high panty hose, let them droop around my ankles and wear a fucking shawl.  How did I go from being 34 to 84 so quickly? I did have fun crocheting all day while listening to the last few gender talks and planning my total domination of the pet business once more.  I also got a call through the grapevine that a major pet food manufacturer is looking to hire me.  I have to be loyal to Alan at this time, but if it were a really better paying offer, and I mean like double the pay, even I couldn't pass that up.  We will see.  I won't be long in the am either I have a bunch of errands to run, and a medical test to take early tomorrow, and then I am going to say goodbye to some old coworkers before we are competitors, screw what anyone may say, I would love to get thrown out of my old office.  Night all, catch up with you latter on.

       THE BITCH IS BACK...  After 50 long days of unemployment, 2 mini nervous breakdowns, 24 job interviews, 60 online applications, and printing up enough resumes to burn through 2 sets of printer cartridges I HAVE A JOB.   Not only do I have a job, it is back in my old business, it should be interesting.  I won't be in direct competition with my old company, so that is ok, but I also won't be able to go visit either,if I was welcome that is.  I hope I can handle the pressure of coming out to all the pet stores in New England, I will at least be able to say I did it.  I find it interesting how I seem to get bigger  balls  every day, when all I want is to get rid of them.  I don't understand why some people though think I am brave for being me.  Brave is what I did for 30 years living as something I wasn't, presenting myself to be a happy guy, when inside I was a girl.  Now I am just being me, there is nothing to be afraid of, the public before part was the act, now I am truly the over emotional lovely person I was hiding all those years.  On another good note I had two poems published in the latest edition of the trans advocacy news letter.  They also talk about this site, I believe the quote was that  "she posts her literary prose, and just bitches about life."   HOLY SHIT dead on.  I love it when I get understood.  I think all this is happening due to some good karma.  I got the appeal from Gender Talk the other day about needing to do some fundraising to keep the program on the air, or more specifically the web.  I did not delay and wrote them out a check without a thought.  I didn't care that I didn't have a job, or if I needed the money, they do a good service for the community, they do reach out and touch troubled souls even more screwy than I, and are a beacon in a sea of turmoil and confusion. I hope some of you will donate too.  Maybe, just maybe, its karma from that, or sending Margaret a planter as a pick me up, or who knows.  I am just so glad that I am back on track, a productive member of society, and back working towards Trinidad.    "Enjoy" these last few days of multiple posts, when I start on Monday I'll be down to once a day or two.  I don't think I have that big of an audience anyway, and only a few ever shared their own poems and such, so that's ok.   This has been, and will continue to be great therapy for me, not to mention a great way to keep in touch with my group of friends new and old.  Thank you all for reading it, listening to the screaming banshee, and still talking to me.  I am lucky to have all of you.  I've gotta go work on the blanket some more, and cancel some interviews.  Take care, LOVE YOU ALL.

       A real confidence booster...  Ok since I am 99.9% sure I am going to accept the job I just had to celebrate with some food I really shouldn't eat.  So me being the big spending glamour gal that I am grabbed five bucks and headed down to KFC.  I know those fast food drive thru's don't have the best sound system, but if I get called sir one more time at one I might just scream.  "That will be $5.29 sir please drive up..."  I briefly wished to crawl through the box and smack some sense into the girl, but I am a nice girl not a nasty one.  Who really cares that some poor soul who is stuck working a nasty job calls me sir, I know what I look like and what I am so it shouldn't matter.  Unfortunately right now for me it does matter.  I hope I can get over this soon, not that I do much fast food anymore.  I got a call from the nice gay fellow who ran the bartender school, he was calling to offer me a job.  I thanked him, said I was sorry but the offer from the other fellow gave me more input in the business and got me out and about in the field.  I asked him if he thought I would do well as a bartender, he said "Yeah, you have the personality, the look, you would do very well at it."  Hmmm, I hope he isn't blowing smoke up me ass, I am going to take that course once I am settled in the new job.    I found a way to help my friend in Boston, I went to FTD and sent her a little planter of lucky bamboo to give her some luck, she called me crying for being so nice.  I feel so bad for my friend, I wish I could help more.  She is such a good person, she just has been shit on in life just because she isn't attractive on the outside, but let me tell you she could be a supermodel on the inside.  Not too many people fall into this category for me, she is up there.  Hopefully luck will come her way, I know she deserves it.  Oh well I'm going to go work on my blanket, I won't have as much free time soon, hopefully.

       Lost in thought...  Well its decision time.  I was offered a job in my old field, calling on my old customers.  The money is ok, its less of a base but the potential is there to earn more than I did at the old job.  I also have to remember us women get paid less then men so I will just have to get used to it.  The fellow offering me the job is a really nice guy who doesn't care about my issues, he knows my abilities and thinks we will make a deadly team.  It will be nice to build a business up again like I did at the last job, it is fun to see your hard work pay off.  I am sleeping on it, and have to answer him in the am.  I have thought so much about just going stealth and fading away, but why?  Firstly maybe I can help someone see we aren't all that bad, secondly I deserve to keep some of my old life, it is mine and I worked hard to get it.  If I do take the job it will be a rough six or so months as I get reintroduced to my customers, but that is life.  My first interview of the day was also very interesting.  I was told I tested tops of all the canidates they were talking to, wow.  They told me that I was as close to a shoe in as they get.  They of course also don't pay for all the tests and licenses you have to attain from the state before you can work for them.  I am pretty hesitant to dish out $1200 for testing for a job I am not sure I am going to like.  I also am uncomfortable with how you get your opening book of business(clients to all you non-sales folks) they ask you for your natural market.  Basically your natural market is a list of your family, friends, and business associates.  Ok, I don't have many friends who still talk to me, my family has no money and I don't have all that much contact with my old business associates.  I did though get a kick out of what they do for you when you join the firm, they throw a big party for you at the office with all your natural market invited.  Ok, lets see, how would that play out?  Hmm, if I invited a bunch of the gals from Twenty a few I know in Cos, it could be a hoot.  I could not imagine the reactions a bunch of straight laced stuffed suit, white republicans would have when they saw some of my friends.  The value of seeing the looks on their faces though is not worth the costs to get there.  I also wouldn't want to subject those nice people to the ridicule from those idiots in the suits.  We take enough heat as it is. I have also decided that if I do take the job in my old business I am going to have to take a second job.  I am almost positive I will take that bartender training course that I interviewed for as an admission's officer.  I am sure I can use my new charms to make some nice tips tending bar.  It would only be for a year, just so I could make sure I have the $ for the surgery.  I am getting anxious and I don't want to let anything beat me now that I am this close.  I just need to suck it up, put my nose to the grindstone and make it happen.  I know that if I work hard enough I will get there, and when I do, I am going to enjoy it all the more, just because I had to work so hard to get there.

       Feeling helpless for friends in need...  I had a good friend from my old job who called me in tears this am after her boyfriend left her.  He was a nasty poor excuse of a guy, but she loved him. Just because someone is a creep it doesn't make it easier to lose them if you love them.  I feel so bad for her, and so helpless in trying to help her.  I can't give her money, I am living on the edge myself, I can't go see her, my old boss is uncomfortable around me.  She doesn't want to live alone, I can't move to Boston, she can't move down here.  I feel so helpless in helping her.  All I can do is talk to her on the phone and offer advice, but I have no experience in having a relationship with a man, so I am not much help in that department.  The old me would have just gone up and given her a big hug, maybe a cute card and a shoulder to cry on.  The new me isn't welcomed up there any more.  I hate being tossed away like an old piece of equipment, but at times like this that is exactly what it feels like.  I am told my old boss reads this so this part is for him.   I am sorry big guy if you are hurt by this, but come on, when do my feelings start to count?  I have value, I am still a person, and I am sorry I make you feel uncomfortable. I wish you could get to a place where you could take seeing me again so we could talk things out, we were a top knotch team at one point, me being like this shouldn't have ended that team, but that is life.  I have to go figure how I can stop in and see my friend without rocking the old boat.  My old boss usually leaves earlier then the rest of the crew, maybe I will just pop up and surprise her one day latter this week.  I just don't know what else to do, but to offer my now less broad shoulders to cry on, and give a hug.  Take care, and of course love to ALL.

        Knitting, napping and Nascar...  I am such the hip gal.  I just spent the loneliest most boring Sunday ever.  I did some online reading, found  a very interesting story on Calpernia's site about her trip out to LA.  She talked about a party she went to, and how sometimes SHE is a wallflower.  I was shocked  that a goddess like she was still a wallflower too.  She described herself as a 10,000 lb gorilla, going into a party looking fine, but still feeling like the geek she was in high school.  I felt kind of the same way, but I am a 1**lb monkey not a big gorilla like her, but it was good to know that even goddesses get the blues and still feel insecure. Did some more work on my recovery blanket.  I am crocheting it, but that didn't work for my title.  I am about 1 foot into it, and I have some time.  It is my therapy for now, and while recovering from surgery I can look at it and think of all the hard work that I put into it, and how I can make it through the pain of those first few weeks.  I also tried to watch some Nascar, but with its repetition and droning sound I fell asleep quickly.   It was good to catch up on my z's.  Forgot all about my photo shoot today and had to reschedule it.  I hope she can, I thought it was a good idea.  Still no concrete decision on the job tomorrow I will keep you all up to date.  Night all.  This monkey's gotta go work on a blanket.

       No rest for the wicked....   or wickeaad for those in Boston  Ok absolutely zonked out around or after 12, by 4:30 I was up.  I tried falling back asleep, but I got all the sleep I could I guess.  Maybe I'll nap latter since the kids and co went home yesterday.    While fighting my loosing battle of falling back asleep I looked back yet again and examined how I felt on how everything was last night.  I hate to sound catty and judging, but I make no secret about my Catholic upbringing and they breed being both judging and catty.   The People  Really cool.  I didn't talk to as many I would have liked to but almost everyone I did was so nice, so friendly.  I only gave out one of my cards, but I was ducking someone.  On that subject, I don't know if she was on drugs, I don't know what her issues was, or if that was the real her, but omg it was  uncomfortable.  I would suggest to anyone to not look to the fab five on how to act as a woman, they are gay men, not women.  I might also suggest that real women don't have those kind of mannerism, or act like that, those qualities and gestures I saw last night were so Nathan Lane so stereotypical, so Springer.  I am fighting those stereotypes from people in my old life so just stay away BITCH.  I find myself wanting to say more and more without being mean, but I cannot, and I am going back and forth typing and deleting nasty little comments.  I just sometimes feel so upset by some people I just unload.  My little tart of a friend, who looked like Jackie O' with a nasty five o'clock shadow, though isn't worth it. Everyone else was really cool like I said, and there were trannies of all ages, shapes and sizes.  Me and my homophobic background made me uneasy at first, but I got over that very quickly, these were really nice people.  I couldn't believe I was ever afraid of this group by the time the end of the night came, and like I said I look forward to next years.  I thought these people were so much braver than I, I pass I am told without much effort,  (if only they knew the old me and how I look in the am still)   so I have less at risk then they do.  I am sure if they were going through the full ride like myself they would find a way to blend.  Blending isn't all about looks, looks help, but confidence is key.  If you act like you belong most of the time it is easy to pass.  I don't get some of my transsexual group who claim they have trouble passing when all I see is a woman, but hey what do I know right, I'm the newbie.  I was also glad to have an FTM from twenty in attendance it was cool he came even though we didn't talk much.  I just enjoy being around other transsexuals sometimes, it reminds me I am not alone.  I saw something I have only heard about but  have never seen, an admirer.  An admirer is a person who loves trannies, why I don't know. I saw an older distinguished man, but I was blown away when a young lady was over trying to pick up my "friend" Jackie O. I don't get allot of stuff that goes on in my community, but I also try not to judge.  I also was impressed and depressed by the amount of SO's in attendance.  It actually made it hard though to figure out who was real, who was just dressed.    Atmosphere  Food and entertainment was great, as was most of the music, I do have to watch Hedwigg I guess, there was some pretty interesting music off that soundtrack.  I ate very well, stayed away from the seeds, and I was at a table where nothing went to waste.  It was good, I feel like such a bad person for leaving good food on my plate when there are so many people without.  I just can't do anything with seeds anymore, damn stress did a number on my system for all those years.  I did also very much enjoy the conversation, but not the nickname I got for my wind blown look.  A girl like me with a name like that is going to have trouble meeting nice young ladies.  I look forward to more debate, I am getting so tired of doing all the talking all the typing, I really miss listening and just reading.  It will all come in good time as I get out more and back to work.  Helen and Betty  Betty was good looking, Helen was different than I imagined, she was not the total babe I envisioned.  I was saddened to hear she isn't a lesbian either, and I just don't have the effort in me to try and turn anyone that way, and if I could it would be co I would be changing.  I didn't go and talk to them, hard to go and talk to someone face to face when you have talked about wanting to "have some fun with them"(sorry its Sunday) in a blog, or to the wife of said person.  Helen's voice still turned me on, so I sat back and enjoyed it, not to mention the talk was good, I will read her book someday, but she is more about CD.  My  Shyness  Hey for me sometimes it is hard for me to move on and not be caught in the past.  This was my first time out in a party setting of this magnitude without the misses. No oh wait, my last office Christmas party, and I got so freakin drunk at that I was sick for days on end.  I don't like to drink all that much, and this time I had to drive so I didn't go that route again.  I will eventually come out of my shell, I just need some time to heal still.  It is hard to try to build a life after the loss of a soul mate.  It is also hard to try and deal with the guilt of what I have done to my family.  I know allot of people who rationalize what they do, I cannot.  No matter how justified I am, no matter how much I did things right, I still screwed over co and made life hard on my kids.  I don't think I will ever fully forgive myself for that, so maybe the guilt kept me back a little too.    Week ahead  Big 3 interview day on Monday and others scattered throughout the week.  The big one is on Monday which will bring me back to my old bis.  I have very mixed feelings on this.  I have the opportunity to go stealth to just fade away, but I also have an obligation(I feel) to try and help my community.  I can go back and show all those people that we as a group are just normal people(ok me as a spokesperson for normalcy?) but I can try. Maybe by my being out I can show them that we aren't all Jerry Springer types or freaks.  If I am successful in helping normalize this maybe life will be a little easier on others in the future.  I just won't deny what I am, or will I walk away from it, I am a transsexual and I always will be, so why hide it.  It is not going to be easy, but I have to try.  I hate the fact I walked away from it, I was good, and I feel I can still do it, at least that's what I am telling myself.  I am more than a little scared about going back to my old customers though, not all will embrace me, not all will be kind, and some might be down right mean or worse.  I will be very careful, don't want to become a hate crime story up in the sticks of rural New England, but I deserve to live and to have a career too.  I need to go back to work, make as much money as I can, and just get to the next part.  I don't know if I will stay in the pet business forever, but right now I need to go back,if only to see if I can do it.  I also want to try and get back out on the trail again before going back to work.  I was hoping to go Wednesday, but lets see how bad I look after going back to electrol, I have been getting so marked up lately. It will depend too on  if I take the job on Monday but I can go Friday, both days look nice on the five day forecast.  It would be nice to go with someone else this time, but that is the cool thing about nature, I never feel alone while out in it.  I still have so much of my old lone wolf in me it scares me, I guess some things never change. Take care and love to all, even to you Jackie O,and if you'd like I can give up a number for a really nice Electrolysist.

       Just a Quickie...(yeah right)  Just got home from the COS banquet and had a good enough time to look forward to next year.  Being a little tired, a little shy tonight, and being pestered by an odd young gal made it not a total joy.  I never recovered from my short night last night, when I did want to get up to dance I found myself ducking an overly aggressive gal who told tales of great proportion.  I should have just gone out and danced a little, oh well, God willing there is always next year.  I just hate missing out on the here and now.  The highlight of the night had to be some of the really cool people I got to talk to.  I hope I made some connections that may turn into friendships down the road.  I also loved the dialogue and debate I got involved in with one of the partners who attended.  It was fun to talk about issues, even ones where I know she was right, or that I totally disagreed with.  I feel bad for talking too much about myself, hopefully she won't be turned off by that.  I can see why my friend has her as a partner, I am sure they can talk back and forth for hours on end.   I am starting to  love the fact that I am picked on for my republican past.  It is like all aspects of my life part of me and cannot be changed, so why try and why apologize for it.  I can't change the fact I was born a man,or anything I have allready done,  but I can change my life now.  Oh well off to bed, hopefully I can actually sleep tonight.  Looking back on the party it is allot like any party, and allot like life. Each only last for so long and if you wait too long you end up not having as much fun as you could and wishing you did more.  I will post more thoughts tomorrow.  Night all.

       Discussions on flooring...  We all ran down to get me some shoes for tonite, and on the way back my daughter asked if we could go for a bike ride. I replied "no honey there is snow everywere, didn't you notice, or are you on drugs."  She's five so it's all in jest.  She pipes back "No maddie I'm not smoking rugs, mommy's smoking rugs."  Now I was not prepared for the next thing to come out of co's mouth, and I swear on a stack of Bibles she said it without any help.  Co replied" No but maddie would love it if I munched them."  OMG, I have never heard her talk that like before.  I quickly replied "You bet your butt. But not as much as I would love to have one, over the wood floor I have now."  Lesbian jokes are a big step for her, who knows maybe someday she might just be where I would like her to be, a full time lesbian, with me of course.  Who knows if that will happen, I highly doubt it, but at least I know she is comfortable enough about stuff to joke about things.

       A few more Pics...  Letting my hair dry and found some more pictures to share.  They are from a long time ago in a decade far far away....  Boys Toys  All these macho toys really worked on making me the person I am today !      Archbishop Dracula  Actually his name was Archbishop Whalen I believe and he was a nice man.  I am on the left, I don't remember my fellow confirmed souls name.  I just got a kick out of all the regalia from the Catholic Church.      Hell's Infants  Me in black, with my friends who were our neighbors in the projects.  Their names are Paul and Carol and they played a major part in my epiphany at age four that something was horribly wrong with me.

       Busy days and sleepless nights...  Had a late night last night, and thanks to J****,my son, it was a short night's sleep at that.  He originally came up to hop in bed with co and I around 2am.  And has been up since 5am.  My late night was my fault, I was a little amorous thanks to my writing about how sexy I find Co still.  I won't get into too many details, I am saving those for the book, I am a literary whore not a slut, a whore makes money from sex while a slut just has gives it away.  I will share that it most likely will be the last time we do that sort of thing.  I cannot do that any more, its just impossible for me.  I actually won't miss the act from that side of the equation, I will miss sharing it with her though.  Like I said more to come in the book.  So thanks to my brain going all the time as always our little escapade turned to tears.  I guess I should listen to my own poems more.  I wrote in "The Last" that if we spend our time thinking that its the last time we do something it ruins the moment.  And let me tell you it does.  I don't want to sound like I was totally sad, some of the tears were of joy due to the fact co and I can still fool around every now and then and just have some "meaningless fun."  Not that the joy we get from the act is meaningless, but there are no more stipulations attached to that act any longer.  We both know that just because we do that doesn't mean we are getting back together, it doesn't change anything in our relationship, we still are in the same boat.  And just because we can't do what we did last night anymore, doesn't mean we still can't have sex anymore, it doesn't take a penis to make a girl happy, otherwise there wouldn't be any lesbians.  And that has been our MO anyway for the longest time.  It is fun to have casual sex with someone I am so close to, I guess that kind of skews it now doesn't it.  Tonight is a first for me, my first time in a formal party setting as Ashley. I hope I don't offend people with my yawns.  It will be hard to be a party gal with the amount of sleep I got, but hey I'm a trooper and I need to have some fun.  I can't believe that just a few weeks ago I was hesitant.  I think its hilarious that the person who approves of my lifestyle the least has gotten me to come out of my shell.   I had left home at 18 after my dad and I had a falling out, and I was too afraid to tell him about my being trans.  I was taken in by a very nice family, I had dated the daughter, and I worked for her parents.  They really saved my life, she got me back to church this time as a Lutheran.  It was kind of like a "Catholic lite" all of the praying with none of the guilt.  Anyway, I got my life back together thanks to their help.  I also came out to her while staying with her, and she was responsible for "scaring me straight".  Or at least she thought she cured me.  So fast forward 16 years and I came out to her again, OMG the hurtful words that erupted from that disclosure.  In her blasting of me and "my life style", like I chose to be like this, she told me to "go be with my own kind."  Originally I was insulted, what did she think we had a colony or something?  After a few weeks I started being haunted by her in my dreams replaying the whole episode all over again.  Then something happened, a little bulb went off.  Why not go be with my own kind?  Not run away totally from my old life to live in the Trans colony of her imagination, but reach out to the trans community.  I did some online research, contacted a really nice person who has become an online friend and mentor. I have found others too like me in this plight, and have found all to be mostly friendly and welcoming. I also have started doing support groups in person, and tonite I go to my first trans party type function.    Thanks Sandy, your harsh mean words, I am having some fun with "my own kind."   Take care, and love to all.

       Ok I'm not totally blonde...   I think I figured out how to put pictures in a post.  One is my most favorite picture of me in my old life with my son.  The other one was just one I took for fun of my daughters doll, some booze and one of my old cigs from when we first moved into our old house.  I used to love to smoke, 1 week from Monday will be my one year anniversary of stopping smoking.  I never thought I would be able to go this long, but I have.

       Another improvement?...  ok I figured how to add pics. Originally  I set up another page that I uploaded pics to.  I have figured it out now as you can see by my above post. I am different than most in my position, I am not afraid to show what I looked like as my old male self.  That is part of my history, I cannot escape what I was, nor do I feel ashamed of it either.  I have moved on, and hopefully will become a better person for it all.  I do block out the faces of my loved ones though.  I might be willing to share, but I refuse to subject them to any ridicule.  Hope you enjoy them as much as I did.  Just so you know the last one was just before we sold our house so I am pretty thin,and in  the beach one I AM holding in my gutt.   first wig       Pics   indian outlaw   					  Jr. Cross Dresser      Old Me and the Crew      Thar he Blows     Old me and the Kids

       Living up to society's expectations...  I have a friend who wants to lose weight, I don't think she needs to, but hey, only one of us has seen her naked, and has to live in that body so I won't argue.  I too felt the same way about my body, and I still have about 11 pounds to reach my ideal weight that I have set for myself.  I have set this goal in finding genetic gals about my height and getting their weight along with research on bmi and ideal weights and such.  I know some of you will say, shut the F* up you are thin enough, but it is hard to live up to the expectations society places on females.  We did not escape the whole thing with living up to these expectations by going through this journey.  Before as men we were expected to be tough, non-emotional, rocks.  We were counted on to provide, to protect, and were looked to as more manly for being promiscuous .  Really tough things to live up too when you have a female brain.  Now as women(or in my case perceived as a woman) we have to be thin, we have to be reserved,we have to be big in the chest, not to mention we have to be non-aggressive sexually or else we are considered whores.  Now for me personally thanks to Doc P. I am not subject to that last one, I know nuns who are more sexual active than I.  It is amazing how society pressures both sides of the gender fence, we never get to get away from them.  I do admit though that they only get to you if you allow them to.    My best friend and ex-spouse co was one who didn't let her self get affected by these standards, for the most part.  She had a great metabolism so she didn't have to try to be thin, she just was.  She also though is hypoglycemic and didn't eat much sugar which could explain much of her being thin.  She used to and still eats like a truck driver.  I still remember a trip to the buffet after one of my hockey games.  Co and I went to the buffet with a teammate of mine who was a big strapping 250lb+ 6'5" bonafide truck driver.  I actually made $5 on a wager that she could out eat him, she did it without blinking.  She also was a strong gal, even when I was my heaviest male weight of 2** she could carry me on her back, she was and still is super woman to me.  She has no idea how sexy I found her for her just being herself. It will be hard to find a gal that did all she did for me.  She did though have one issue with society's expectations, breasts.  Let me state her breasts are just the right size for her frame, but when you are exposed to all the silicone on TV every day if gives you a complex.  I am approaching her in my natural size and she is starting to get uncomfy about it.  I have a higher percentage of body fat than she, and I have a bigger frame so I most likely will outgrow her, but that is nature.  I would gladly switch with her and be wearing a two piece this summer instead of a one piece and shorts on top.  I know how tough it is for genetic gals to live up to these hard expectations, add 30+years of exposure to testosterone to the mix and it is even tougher.  I know I won't ever be a super woman, I won't be a trans goddess like Calpernia, I just have to get to accept me for what I am.  So far I really like what I have a whole lot more than I had before.   And beauty is not the same as being attractive, beauty is the looks on the outside, they are carnal and fleeting.  Attractive is the a different beauty, it is your personality, it is your confidence, it is your soul.  Really attractive people stay attractive for ever, age, weight doesn't change that as long as outlooks don't change with them.  I would rather be attractive than beautiful any day, unfortunately I have some more primping to do.    Only one interview today, another financial company.  I am so excited about the banquet tomorrow night, I just wonder what kind of people I am going to meet.  I hope to meet some nice people there, and just have a good time.  This will be my first time out in a formal type setting as Ashley, should be fun.  My knee is feeling better so I might even dance, but I had no rhythm as a man, I doubt taking hormones has changed that much, we will see.  Take care, and love to all.

       Shocked to shit...   I got a call from the gentleman that I interviewed with the other day that I had to tell about my situation due to his brother in law being an ex-employer and customer of mine who knows the truth about me.  Firstly he wanted me back for a second interview which is cool, secondly he apologized for being a little distracted during our interview.  I guess they don't train you for some nice young lady telling you she used to be a man.  It was funny how he was trying to be so apologetic, it was bordering on sweet.  I asked him what his brother in law had to say about me.  I was shocked, he said I was a great worker, and while he didn't understand or approve of my decision, he admitted I would be a great person to hire.  I can't believe the same man who didn't wait 5 minutes to spread the gossip of my situation to all he knew that knew me would actually be nice.  The day I told him I was so upset, the look on his face was grotesque, he was looking at me like I had just told him I was a pedophile.  Sometimes I think it takes people just a little bit of time to get over the initial shock and uncomfortableness of this all, before they remember all the good things I did for them in the past, or the past we share.  I hope that even more people closet to me can do the same thing.  It will take time, I will just take it one step at a time.  Gonna go watch the Matrix 2, goodnite all.

       Funny additional thought...  A few years back, Dee Snider of Twisted Sister Fame had a local radio show.  I loved Dee from back in the day.  I was a young teen back in the day, but come on what better role model for a trans boy in hiding than a big haired, loud rocking, shock type transvestite?  He was the first real cross dresser I saw out in the media, I know he was doing it for the shock value, but it still had similarities.  Ok so back to the funny part.  Dee had a contest that was a take off of the Vagina monologues, he called it The Penis Diaries.  They asked listeners to send in a story or a poem about their or someone else's Penis.  I wrote "Ode to Mr. Happy"  I think I lost this one a while back, but I will look for it to post.  I do remember the beginning " Purple helmeted warrior, How I wish you could do more".   Yes more indeed like turn into a vagina.  Anyway my entry was one of the winners selected, got read on the radio, and I got to go down with the group of wiener winners to meet and greet Dee and the gang.  It was pretty cool to meet someone you were so awestruck by as a child and I never even introduced myself.  I was always writing into the show too.  I doubt there are any of his peeps reading this site, but one of the old names I wrote into the show as was Mr. Fister.  Ok not a name I was proud of, but it got me noticed and my stuff on the air.  So I am really looking forward to hopefully being in this new trans v-monologue type thing. Since I've already done the penis one, why not this?  I love being a well rounded individual I think it would be hilarious to be able to look back and have done this.  I hope someday to maybe do the real V-monologues, I just think I need to get mine first.

       The times they are a changing...  I cannot get over how many interviews I have all of a sudden I am so booked solid I have to go to the store and get some more stuff, and I should get another business outfit.  I went to one this morning and had three other people call me while out.  I wish they would have called a month ago, before I tapped my funds so low, before I let myself get so blue.  I now have the opposite problem, I am feeling confident and daring, and wanting to do lots of stuff I was too scared to before.  History lesson time.  I made an awful male, I couldn't get over my being different and let it get the best of me, and felt so defective.  I was so afraid of things that I shouldn't have been so scared by.  For example my last job required lots of driving, I worked in New England so we get a good amount of snow every winter.  I used to be so petrified of dying in a car wreck in the snow.  I was afraid that I would not get a chance to get to experience being a female.  I went out and worked when I could in the snow, but I put myself under so much stress it wasn't healthy.  I also so wanted to fit in to not draw attention to myself, so I poured everything I had into the sports I played.  I was never the best, but I always sacrificed my body to help the team.  All I am left with is some ache joints, 2 knee surgeries, and several mild concussions.  I was very stupid as a man, I kept figuring that the more of a man I was I would enjoy it more, but just made myself and others miserable.  Glad to be gone of that.  Now the new me wants to do lots of stuff.  I write openly about my experiences on this site, telling my story while honing my craft.  I am involved in support groups and such online and in person.  I am meeting so many wonderful people due to "my affliction" and it is making it feel not so bad.  I am supposed to do a photo shoot for someone who is involved in PFLAG, I sent out an email last night trying to find out about participating in the Gay Games. I even sent out an email back this morning for more information on an audition looking for transgendered persons to do a sort of V-monologues type of play.  I cannot believe for one second the old me would have tried to do anything like this, but I am not that damaged little individual any longer.  I am getting so many opportunities just because I am different, I am learning to embrace that, and grow as a person.  I feel, being a Christian, that we only get one trip down here, and it doesn't last all that long.  With this philosophy in mind, why not try new things?  I now will be able to say I did some modeling, even if I don't get to be in the play I can always say that I auditioned.  And even though there aren't many of you out there who read this site, I can say in confidence I am an author.  I want to get as much out of this life as I can.  There is so much that we all have been given, if only we see them, and use our gifts to reach out to them, that's when the fun begins.  Life is also tragic, no matter what we enjoy or get out of life, it is eventually taken away.  We also have many friends and loved ones come and go on this journey, sometimes more go then come, but such is life.  I just want to be able to say I lived, and I did it with courage, poise, strength, and at the end still be me.  Love to all, take care.

       Wasted ASSets...  Oh well another interview that I got extra dolled up for nothing.  I knew I was meeting with a man this time, so back on with the skirt.  I got there, and yes it was with a man, but a VERY GAY MAN.  Oh well, maybe God is trying to tell me something, or maybe he is just keeping up the comic relief.  I don't want to sound prejudice but his being gay actually made me comfortable.  We went through the process of q & a, and the question came up why I left my last job.  I asked if that was his jeep outside with the rainbow bear sticker on it, just to not seem rude in just assuming he was gay.  He replied yes, so I told him the reason I left was because I was a transsexual.  He seemed a little surprised, so I asked the obvious "could you tell, or do I pass?"  He assured me he had not a clue I was anything other than what I appeared.  He was very nice, and wanted me to start next Monday with training in Pittsburgh.  I told him I would take the job right now, except that I have a pending interview with an old friend in the bis who I promised I wouldn't take any other jobs until we talked on Monday or Tuesday.  I told him the only reasons I was waiting was because I gave my word, and I feel I have something to prove to myself in my old field.  He said he would talk to the trainer to see if they could put training off a week, but couldn't promise me anything.  He of course wanted to know how the two opportunities paired up against each other, I had told him it sounded like I could make more money with him, than with the old friend, so they were in the lead.  I hope he holds it for me, just in case, I really would love to get back in the bis, but I also need to eat and replenish my funds to get the big o.  I have another interview in the morning with a cellphone company and the finance co in the pm, so I don't know if I'll be writing much tomorrow.  Take care and good night.

       Help Wanted : Professional Interviewer...  Its going like wild fire again in the job hunt. Interviews; I had 2 yesterday, 1 this am, another tonight, 2 tomorrow, 1 Friday, another 1 on Monday, oh and 1 on Tuesday also.  I haven't gotten to anything good yet, at least that wanted me, but at least I know I could work as a professional interviewer.  I am though starting to feel cheap.  I have always gone out to an interview looking my best, and looking my best now at least for the first interview is a standard outfit: tight turtle neck, nice blazer, knee length skirt and sensible heels.  I love being a girl, but OMG, I really don't like having to keep putting on polished gal look so much.  I hope like hell I can back in my old industry where things are a little more dressed down, business casual instead of sophisticated hooker.  Ok, I don't look like a hooker, but I feel like one sometimes, I'm just not getting paid, the getting f****d part is debatable depending on your meaning of the word. Today's first interview caught me off guard, it was for a very prestigious financial company that you should never leave home with out.  I got all dolled up full effect since I was supposed to be interviewing with a man.  I had to shovel my car out and clear off my car, in a skirt and heels because I didn't pay attention to how much we got, I get all the way there frozen, but still looking good, and out comes this thin little 20 year old 110 lb thing almost as tall as me to do the first part of the interview process.  I hate to sound catty, but I am.  I get so jealous of some genetic girls who can look so good by just being born, and I have to work my ass off just not to be made.  Anyway, they had me take several tests, which I passed easily.  I will say I did take more time than I thought I would on the math part.  I just had trouble remembering equations for back figuring percentages so I found different ways to answer them correctly.  I have to go back tomorrow and Monday for more information.  Tonight's interview is for being an admissions officer for a small private school, totally on commission, getting young adults towards their dream jobs in the field of adult beverage dispensing.  Not a dream job, but it will pay the bills if I can do it right, and give it my all.  I look at all of this as a learning experience I just hope I learn all the right lessons from both what went right and what went wrong.  I better go study up for my next two interviews.  See ya latter, unless I decide to pull out the Matrix and another bag of popcorn that is.

       Break in the action...  Took a break yesterday evening and last night, I just needed too.  No research, no writing, no  job search, and especially no feeling blue.  I decided instead to indulge in an old bad habit, I just plopped my ass on the couch, sat down with some chocolate and some hot popcorn and watched the idiot box.  I used to be such a TV junkie, but I have found that living by yourself and not working makes you not that into TV, you would rather connect with people, even if it is through the computer.  So I watched some jeopardy, I would love to go on that show.  I don't know if they have ever had a transsexual jeopardy champion but I would love to give it a shot.  Co has told me forever that I was a repository of useless information, and I have wanted to try out for jeopardy for some time.  I have always been afraid before, stupid stuff like that doesn't scare me anymore, staying like this does.  I hate this freaky in between time, not fully male, not fully female.  This I hope is the worst part of the trip.  I love the fact I see so much Ashley in the mirror, but when I pass the mirror on the way to the shower I get reminded of my maleness.  I see that growth between my legs, I see the ravages all the years testosterone have taken on my natural hairline, I see how muscular my thighs still are from all those years of manual labor and hockey.  Hey I have it better than allot of T-gals but I still know my flaws and tend to pay too much attention to them.  After jeopardy I just had to watch "Soldiers girl" for the 2nd time.  It was nice to be able to watch it solo, and go back if I wished(sorry co).  I caught allot of things I missed or did not notice the first time.  First of all I hate to admit, but I found Troy Garrity even more attractive.  Secondly I noticed many more flaws in Lee Pace's makeup job, all I kept seeing was beard shadow.  He still has a great body as a woman.  Sorry to lead off with looks, but hey I speak my mind on that stuff.  On a more important note, I found so much more courage in Barry's character this time through.  He went against all that was taught to him by society all for true love.  He went out and was honest with himself, looked deep down into his soul and found that sexuality is not black and white, and that love is worth the effort.  I feel a kinship to him, I too am trying to find my comfort level in the realm of sexuality.  Right now I describe myself as an inactive/bi-very curious/pre op.  I love lots of different looks on a carnal level, but I am more interested in what is inside, personality, and the confidence one has.  These things have no bearing on sex, I know both men and women with these qualities.  My favorite person with these qualities loves only men though, so we can't be together that way anymore, it sucks, but what can you do.  Back to the movie.  I also noticed several interesting things I didn't before.  I do the same exact thing that Calpernia's character did in the movie when nervous.  They show her trying to calm herself down before answering the door to let Barry in, she takes a few deep breaths and tells her self several times "poise, confidence.." .  I do the same thing except I add the word strength to the end.  I also noticed in the movie, she and I share the same old male name.  I don't remember if she talked about it in her book, and co has it right now, but I will check when I get it  back.  I also really loved the music this time.  Number one crush is just so good at times at just making me feel so sensual.  I also loved the spooky sensuality of " the consequences of falling" not to mention the spicy hot sexuality of  "fever".  Lee pace I think really did capture a little bit of Calpernia's stage presence, but I have a feeling not all of it.  When I read her book, and from what I heard, she was larger than life on stage, I didn't get that from the movie.  The best song was the Annie Lennox tune, and I don't know the name, but the line goes " Dyeing is easy, its living that scares me.  Holy shit preach on sister.   Oh well I have to go get ready for another interview, this time as a financial advisor.  I decided to blow off the car sales training course.  I am waiting anxiously to hear from my bud in the bis once he gets back, but I am not stopping the whole job process.  I actually decided against a job opportunity last night for selling high end salon products.  I just feel that while I am confident enough about my looks, I am not the right kind of gal to sell their image or their products.  Oh well, gotta go with what God gave ya, and just make a go of it I guess. Take care, and of course love to all.

       Feast, Famine, and God's Sense of Humor...  I don't know how to take the ups and downs lately, I am getting to live a bi-polar or manic depressive life, with out the chemical imbalance.  Last night I was in tears from Aflac turning me down, today I had two interviews, set one for tomorrow and one for next week.  I also am playing phone tag with another prospect.  I don't know what exactly happened between last night and today, other than a few tearful prayers to God.  I may be a recovering Catholic, and turned off from organized religion, but I still love and fear God greatly.  I do pray to him/her all the time, not only in need but also in thanks.  We are trying to bring up our children to have God in their lives too, my daughter is so cute saying grace at the dinner table every weekend.  Anyway to move on, I am sure God did intervene, and not only through some opportunities my way, but some comic relief as well.  First interview was with a recruiter for a local cell phone company selling service to businesses.  My interviewer was a very nice older gentleman, very tall, which made me feel not so bad about being 5-8 wearing heels.  So we did the normal stuff, background, his bs questions about my abilities my bs answers.  Don't get me wrong I can sell, I have done so successfully my whole life, I sold that I was happy as a man, while all the while I was a female, at least psychologically.  So in the interview, I used my charm and talking and get the poor man off into tangents, being my friendly self, and gathering info.  Turns out he's from Maine originally just like my family, and we got to talking about his brother. He goes on about how his brother's wife left him for another woman, to which I replied" well it is a great big world out there, and it takes something different to make us happy."  I am so glad I went pee before coming, I was dying holding in the laughter.  It gets better though, we then turn talk to the group I would be working for "Its a group of just young men, you would be the only woman working there, does that bother you?" he asked.  "No I am quite used to working in groups of mostly men." I quickly replied.  He then went off tangent big time, and slightly out of bounds when he told me that he always liked employing "beautiful women with brains".  He told me, "you are attractive, don't ever let yourself be afraid to use it to your advantage."  Again I was dyeing inside, and he kept going,"I get allot of candidates in here, and none of them seem to have the total package like you do. You are attractive, your are personable, you present well, and you are smart.  I think anyone would be foolish not to hire you, and you last boss was a fool to let you go."  Wow, lots of compliments, some bordering on flirting, I really appreciated it, but all the time I was laughing.  I love that I have kept my ability to get people to feel comfy enough around me to open up, and say things they normally wouldn't.  It is a gift I've had forever, and I guess still have.  I think it's the smile, and how good I listen to them, that makes them share.  Unfortunately sometimes people share too much.  Overall whether I get the job or not, I really enjoyed the comic relief God threw my way.  Interview two was with a major, big box company in the business of selling home improvement products, and sponsor a certain #20 car on the NASCAR circuit. This was the full disclosure interview.  My interviewer is brother in law to one of my old bosses, an old boss that freaked out when I told him, and spread the word like wildfire. So its not like I had a choice in this one.  I started the interview by handing him my resume, my good one with the cover graphic, he grabbed it joking,"Oh it's pink, I hate pink, don't bother to take your coat off."  Me and my wit replied, "well if you are that upset about a color, I best not tell you too much about my past."  I then asked the big question" so did you talk to John about me?" He hadn't.  I then said" I don't know what he will have to say about me, but the last time he and I talked it was not a pleasant experience."  He looked puzzled. I then continued in telling him, after a brief pause how his brother and law freaked out when I told him of a change I was going through. He looked more puzzled.  I continued" I haven't always looked like this and John kinda freaked out about it."  He understood immediately, and told me he did not care, he could handle that.  He told me how he had seen the dateline program a few weeks back, and had gotten a new understanding for the plight I was going through.  I assured him, I kept my personal life just that at work, and would not be talking about my trans satus.  It was a very good interview, he assured me "my difference" should not be a problem, and he would be calling me if my background came back good.  I told him my old name, so he wouldn't be shocked.  I hope he calls back, they do have good benefits, and I would still be doing sales, just in home sales.  It was so nice to not have to hide what I was, and to not be afraid of latter rejection.  I don't recommend this path to my brothers and sisters out there, it was a tough place to be.  It felt like it did when I  gave my presentation to my boss and my co-workers, like being totally naked and vulnerable, not fun at all.  I lucked out with an understanding fellow, most who try get instant rejection.  This was a good interview too.  The only things that were bad about this morning was the fact I couldn't find my gaff and had to tape, OMG I cannot wait for Dr. Bowers or somebody else to take care of that.  I also found out how much heels could hurt the day after blading for six miles, but you gotta wear them if you are gonna wear a short skirt.  Before the interviews I got a call from an old friend in the bis.  He wants me to come work for him in a bad way.  I am really thinking about doing it.  I need to prove to myself that I still can do it, and that my customers don't care what I look like.  Yeah I'm sure I will run across 1 or 2 assholes, but that's life.  I know my abilities, I've built little bits of nothing into a successful territory before, and GD it I can do it again.  I am really excited about this, and can't wait to talk to him on Friday once he gets back from a trade show in New Orleans.    I will try to keep y'all up to date, I hope you got a kick out of my experiences today as much as I did.  This is not a fun journey, but I so enjoy when God throws a little comic relief my way. Love to all.

       Letting it pile...  Wow, I don't ever want to go through that again.  Last night before bed, I was feeling extremely blue, and wanted to expel those demons before going to sleep.  I tried working on a piece darker than I have ever gone before, a suicide note.  NOW PLEASE DON"T WORRY I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE YET.  I have come too far, and have so much left to experience yet.  I wanted to remind myself how awful that place is. I have been within minutes of killing myself before.  I had planned to drive off the Goldstar bridge on 95 and make it look like an accident, no note, just plain chicken-shit.  Anyway since I am here I had a change of heart, and have gotten over that dark day.  So last night I thought it would be good to try and write a note, to see what I would say.  Of course I included a bad poem, and then an awful note striking out at people.  I cannot describe the utter despair and grief I felt.  I also cannot say I was kind to some who I feel slighted by.  It took me a while to come back after going down such I dark road, I was crying, and sobbing, and just so saddened by the experience.  I actually wrote a blog on it last night around 11, but I needed time to digest the whole experience, and of course reflect. I am not using the post I wrote last night, and after a short night I have had time to evaluate things.  I have come to the realization I need to work out some issues with several people, it is not good to feel so hurt and remain silent.  I also think it would be wise for me to stop working on my book for now, that is until I get a job, and not so emotionally raw.  I think it is great that many of us transsexuals can do this kind of self check on things, but we learned at a young age to not share our dilemma's.  By doing this we were forced to learn how to get in touch with feelings and how to make things better, those who couldn't turned to distractions like drugs and alcohol, others wrote real notes and gave up.  I hope I never get to a place where I am writing a real good-bye note like that, it is a very dark way to leave this life.  Back to real life, I am continuing the job crusade still.  Today is the big test, today is the first time I am going into an interview planning on full disclosure.  I hate to do it, but due to the situation(check out last night) I am left with little choice.  This is not a dream job, but a stop gap opportunity for now, so if it doesn't work out its ok.  I also need to do this to see what kind of reaction I get and to see how I pass.  I think it is good sometimes to use an opportunity to work on things, not all interviews are just for looking work. I have gone through the process several times, just to learn and develop a style.  If all else fails, I hope today will at least be an experience that I can learn and grow from.  I am also really considering going back to my old field and see if I can do it with baggage.  I don't know why I shouldn't be able to.  A very successful rep for one of the companies actually bit someone at her last job, and had a mini nervous breakdown.  I have never bit anyone, ok since childhood, so I most likely will be ok.  It will take some time to get people comfortable with me, but they usually do.  I got a beautiful email from one of Paul's daughters thanking me for the poems, and telling me how brave and beautiful I am, like I need a bigger head.  The thing that made it special was when she first was introduced to me, her face showed her feelings of not being cool with things.  She was able to defeat her pre-conception of me, just by me offering a few kind words to open the door, and her just hanging out around me for a few hours.  People expect the worst out of us as a group, I love it when we can dispel their fears.   Sorry for the dark start to the day, hopefully my pm post will be more upbeat. Take care and love to all.

       Trials and tribulations...  I am running out of options.  I just got an email from another job I was hoping to get, and again when it got to the references part, a screeching halt.  I don't know if its coincidence, or paranoia or what.  I just have this awful feeling one of my references is deceiving me, or just screwing up.  I am working on a way to re-assure myself it is not that but something else.  I hope to God that I am not right.  I am so scared right now, I am so close to either failing or achieving my life's dream, and I am walking a razor's edge. I had written a nastier, ruder version of my theory, but took a second to re think it.  I need to be careful to not burn any more bridges, but I do feel very hurt and bitter right now.  I have another interview with a big company tomorrow,  unfortunately the man interviewing me is the brother in law of one of my old employers, who also was a customer of mine.  This was the customer who almost died in shock when I announced my change.  It should be interesting, I am scared what he might find out about me, when he calls his brother in law, but I refuse to lie down and go away.  I am going to play this one openly and honestly, this is who and what I am.  I can sell, and I have a little something in my past, let me prove to you how good I can do.  If it works, great, if not, I am no worse off, he is going to find out anyway.  On a brighter note, I spent a good amount of time going back and updating the book.  I am reworking the chapter on the fuzzy in-between time of part time rlt, and coming out.  It is really cool to see how stuff has changed in just a few months since I wrote the first draft.  It also opened up some wounds.  I am going to share two snipets from this chapter of my work in progress.  Snipet one talks about my leaving hockey and my friend Chris. I have taken out my old male name, I know some of you know it, but I do wish to have just a little privacy.  I have won over a dozen trophies over the all the years of playing, I"ve kept them all as mementos, but I only display two of them.  The first one is from my only undefeated season, the same season I finished second in scoring by one point, and I had missed some games coming off of knee surgery.  The second one is the last one that I won, my retirement trophy.  After that final buzzer blew on the deciding game of the finals, I turned to my long time friend and team captain Kevin, shook his hand and said "thank you, its been fun, I'm retiring."  The look of shock was replaced with a smile, and he responded "good try", he thought I was joking.  He said things like:" it's in your blood, or you're too young." I just responded that I needed time to fix my marriage, he bought it.  Like I said it is easier to believe that someone you've know forever is going thru marital troubles, than it is they want to be a girl.  They called me a few times, whenever it was time for a new season.  I went back for one game at a state of the art facility that I always dreamed of playing in, it was awesome.  It was a full Olympic sized rink, you could eat off the sport court surface, and they not only announced goals, assists, and penalties, but they also played music in between plays. It was what I had dreamed of, but it was too late for me.  I was too far on my journey, and I needed to focus on more important things than hockey.  I think I finally got them to stop when my good friend Chris called me after N***** and I had split and said" Ok, you're settled, now come back and play, its fun, you could use a distraction."  I replied to him "sorry it's just not in my blood any more, I don't miss it one bit."  From the silence on the other end of the phone, you would think that I just told him I had some terrible disease.  He was shocked and replied" I NEVER, EVER, thought those words would come out of your mouth".  Which I replied "me neither, but things CHANGE, and people want different things out of life."  I kind of thought that gave him a clue of what was going on.  I can't prove it, but I just felt it that he knew.  He had been in the circle of few who knew about my past trans feelings and that we both knew that after his wife found out about me that she would no longer allow us to be friends.  His wife, while a sweetheart, was ultra protective of their two daughters, and she would NEVER allow them to be exposed to someone like me.  They might grow up to be freaks themselves.  I even hoped that they would keep me around just enough to use me as a threat to the kids:  Do your homework, or you'll end up like S****.  Eat your veggies, or you'll end up like S****.  Say your prayers, and be good, or you'll end up like S****.  You know just like we were kids, and our parents would tells us awful things that would happen if you failed to tow the line.  But I knew deep down once he knew our friendship would be over, and he had been close to me since high school.  He was one of my best men at my wedding (yes I had to be different and have two) and he was like a brother to me.  We were often mistaken in mixed company as brothers and we treated each other as such.      Snipet two pertains to a funny thing that happened between me and tubby while I still had respect for him.  My favorite surreal moment at work though came as I was driving to or from an electrology appointment that I had told my colleague was a dental appointment.  He had called me while I was being treated and when I reminded him that I was getting the teeth worked on he quipped" geez the work on the hair, you're fixing the teeth, what's next a sex change?"  I wanted to scream so bad "Yes you fat fuck, that is exactly what I'm going to do.  And then once they are done, I'm going to come up and give you a big ole trans sexual lap dance, just so you can be sure they got rid of every inch."  But thankfully I thought better of it.  I liked the guy, but deep down I always had the suspicion that he was out to get me so he could be top dog.  He never came out and said it, but I think it was convenient for him to keep tabs on me.  I played dumb and fed him the information that I wanted him to have, all the time, he thought he was sly.

       Friendship...  I just had a phone call from a potential employer and was scrambling for some paper.  In my quest I found a poem I wrote a week or two ago about how my relationship with co has changed to one of friendship, but we still have that past.  This one came to me one night as we lay in bed talking about how it just wouldn't work out to be the way it was.  I really learned in that conversation how much in common we have, probably now more than ever.  The unfortunate thing is the thing we have in common is what keeps us apart.  You see, we both lost someone to this whole Trans thing, she a husband and a lover, me a wife and a lover. We also feel guilty for our actions, I obviously for doing this, she for not being able to stay with me.  We both are recovering Catholics, and feel way too much guilt already. We both are feeling the same loss, the same pain, just on opposite sides of the road.  This poem I wrote to show even though we lost in love, we are still blessed with our caring for each other as friends.    Distance..     We may share the same bed, But the distance between us seems great. Greater than any, Comment, Gesture, Or feeling  Could ever bridge.  We roll over face to face, And as we stare Into each other's eyes. The dim moonlight illuminates our faces. We can clearly see, Even in this poor light, How we each feel So  far  away  from each other. These feelings soon give life to tears, In both our eyes. And as slowly we reach up, To dry one another's tears, We bridge that distance. It only took that split second, To get lost in, How close we truly are.

       6 miles, 16ounces...  Oh my God, I just got back from the rail trail.  It was my first time down there ever, I don't remember the last time I skated that much, and guys with sticks weren't out to get me.  I don't know exactly how far I went, I skated down a little past the .3 mile marker on the hamden side, and the entire length of the Cheshire portion, if I was reading the markers right, Cheshire is a little over 2.5 miles each way + the Hamden portion equals 6 miles.  Pretty good for an out of shape ex-hockey player.  I had been afraid to go by myself, but a trans friend who has more experience, I won't dare call her "older" she'd kick my butt, told me I was afraid of nothing, and just use my head.  I am glad as always that I listened.  I ran into allot of nice people, a good amount with dogs.  I had to have some sort of expression, and let those with the knowledge know about my trans-status by putting that cool little symbol from xxclub and as seen on gender talk on my skates.  Nobody will know what it means except those who are in the GLBT community.  I think of it like a little way to say hello to someone else in the same kind of boat.  I didn't talk to too many people, a few nice men gave a smile and a hello, but that was it. Overall it was a good trip, next time though I will skate it the opposite direction as I found it was a slight uphill slope back.  I downed a whole 16oz bottle of H2O on the trail, and another one on the way home. Before hopping in the shower I decided for shits and giggles to hop on the scale, I lost a pound.  I was XX2 this am and XX1 this afternoon.  Let's see if I could do that for another 10 days, I will reach my goal for this summer.  I am not big, but I can be lighter, and do it in  a healthy way.  I still have allot of muscle mass in my legs that will take some time to go, and of course a little bit of a tummy problem.  I have lost close to 50 lbs already from my heaviest male weight, but I did put some back on when I quit smoking and started hormones.  I am back to about 3lbs over my lightest adult male weight, so I will get there.  I hope to go many more times this spring and summer, I hope to find a job that will allow me the time.   The interview today was just a pitch for their training program, a fee based training program.  Of course, he didn't want to discuss how much when I asked, he said we would discuss it on the first day.  I have my doubts about this, but I will sleep on it.  On a brighter note, I guess I am really passing.  The interview was in an hotel room, and he made sure to leave the door open to make sure he was protected from accusations of ill propiety.  It is cool to be able to appreciate the little things in this journey.  I will find a job soon, it will just take some more work.  Not to mention, pretending to be dumb enough to get hired, and then work my ass off, once I am in the door.  Sorry for making it sound bad to be a woman, but if you see both sides, you see allot others don't. Catch you latter y'all.

       Crisis of community...  Lets get the heavy shit out of the way first.  Today is a big day for our community here in CT.  There is an anti-hate crime bill that they are having a rally/testimony for today.  I have already sent in my letters to my state reps and such, and we as a group on Saturday were asked to attend in support if we could.  I would love to go, this bill needs to pass, not so much for the hate crime stuff, but the collateral stuff that comes with it.  Police and other public officials would have to take workshops and get educated about us, they would learn we aren't all sexual deviants like on the talk show circuit.  It would go a long way, just to give us some dignity in the community.  I though am no protester, never have been, and most likely never will.  I remember when my brother came out gay, I told him I loved him, I supported him, and wanted him in my life, I just wouldn't be marching in any parades.  I have chosen the diplomatic route to my form of protest.  My writing is my gift, it may not be much, but its mine.  I have tried to use it to reach out to others.  For instance, I reached out with some beautiful words for Paul, two of his kids liked it so much they hugged me, and told me in confidence they did not care about the trans issue.  I was able to connect thru my poetry to them, and if they are sincere, maybe they will be nicer to another trans person they meet.  The other part of my style is just being me, nice.  I had some pretty awful shit happen to me at my last job where some pictures got emailed around of me.  It was a totally nicely intended thing that got into someone's hand that it didn't belong in, and they spread it.  Two of my friends were responsible for the initial friendly mistake, they were so afraid I would hate them forever.  I forgave them without pausing for a second, they didn't do it with malice or ill intent.  By showing how forgiving I was also showed to these people we are strong.  Lastly at my old job, allot of people think I was railroaded out, I don't know.  My boss had a tough decision, I was under stress, but I took his offer and held my head up high with dignity.  I did not reduce myself to nasty little digs at him, I showed class and respect.  In doing this I think I have earned the respect of others.  I am no saint though, I have ended old friendships with pre-emptive strikes, like with tubby.  I had heard some stuff about his being two faced, and talking behind my back.  It hurt so I struck back hard and unforgiving.  I am told he won't ever talk to me again, oh well his loss.  I hope that I am taking the right approach in this thinking of diplomatic protest.  It is just my nature, I am the Charming, good bitch remember.  I left it up to Co to be the mean one all these years.    A few lingering thoughts on the weekend.  I haven't mentioned my mom's friend Libby.  Libby is a saint, she helped out my mom and Paul so much, and she spent the last few days cooking all the food for the service.  Libby was there so much for my mom, and helped us out so much.  I thank God that mom has a friend that nice.  I gave her this website info, after she said how much she loved my writing.  So if you are reading Libby thank you for helping my mom so much.  You are a great person, and I hope you are paid back with kindness 10 fold.  At the support group meeting I met another member who will be attending COS this weekend.  I had talked to her via email before, and we were just chatting.  She said to me"Oh by the way, there will be a girl there doing make overs."  My heart sank with dread, and I just had to ask" Why do I need one?"  She said no very quickly and apologized, I was sorry for making her feel awkward for telling me, but that is what went through my mind.  I guess it is true, I do have a female brain,and have the same reactions most genetic women have.  Take care, love to all.  I have to go interview for the car job, and maybe head to the LOB after to lend some support.

       In the lions den...  Wow, what an experience.  I can't believe I was strong enough to just do that.  I just spent over 5 hours with extended family and some strangers at Paul's memorial service.  It wasn't easy, and allot happened.  Most of my family are born again, sorry I was born only once, and never strayed, so I don't have the same catching up to do.  They all had little digs, and even making eye contact was a total effort for them.  The leader, my eldest cousin, and head religious zealot was decent, other than the fact he kept introducing me as "Ashley, you know my cousin who used to S****.  After a few times, I took him aside and asked him kindly to just refer to me as Ashley. He kindly obliged.  His brother, the family smartass, only made two bad ill tasted jokes at my situation.  One being the innocuous line from Seinfield, about gay people, "not that there's anything wrong with that."  I know it doesn't sound like much, but if you saw the eye contact we had when he said it, and his little facial message for me.  The second one almost sent me out of the house in tears.  We were talking about one of my other cousins who recently had his third child, he said "yeah they are gonna stop now that they have one of each sex."  I stood my ground but bit my tongue and didn't even blink when all in the room turned to me to see my reaction to his faux paus.  I didn't give him the satisfaction of showing any effect.  While for the most part they were kind and understanding, they kept their distance, and behaved.  No witch burnings, no rack, no inquisition.  My eldest cousin did ask that I call him, so we could discuss more about my situation, you know so he could save me.  The absolute and most fantabulous thing happened though at the service.  My aunt who is in her late 50's early 60's comes up to me and  asks "where's your husband, he didn't come?"  My sister hadn't arrived yet, and she thought I was her.  I fucking loved it, not only because I had fooled my aunt who I have known since birth, but she mistook me for the least supporting member of my family.  Oh and you should know I am a good 6 inches taller than my sister and a little lighter in weight, so we don't look all that much alike, aside from the face.  I think it was so awesome, that she made that mistake.  She came over after my little sister arrived and apologized for not realizing it was me, but I said it was ok and took it as a big compliment.  Paul's family was pretty accepting for the most part, I got a few stares from folks, but who the hell cares, you can't win them all.  They loved the poems I wrote for their dad, and told me they sounded like his words, I almost cried from how touched they were.  I am very proud of my mom, she only used the old name once, and he three times, and on an emotional day, so she did good.  The best support came from Co though, she showed up just to show all the people who were judging me that she was cool with this, that she still cared for me, so they should shut their pieholes, and learn to live with it.  I am paraphrasing her, she has always been the more strongly opinionated of the couple.  I told her the other day, that we still make a great pair, even if it is only as friends, she's the mean bitch, and I'm the charming bitch, so we compliment each other  nicely.  All in all it was a good day, I was so glad I went, and did not let myself to be intimidated by a nasty few.  I have to go and prepare for another interview tomorrow, this time car sales.  Good nite and love to all.

       Have two dreams, and post me in the morning...  Well as usual, another bad nights sleep, I have a cavity that just has to be looked at that has a habit of waking me every night.  Last night I was smart though, I took two advil and got back to sleep quicker and actually stayed asleep.  I also had the pleasure of two dreams, not just any dreams but really cool dreams.  The first one involved me getting chased through my apartment complex by two huge Rotwielers.  You are saying, OK THAT'S COOL?  Well it is if you live inside my crazy head. Firstly, I am still spiritual in a Christian way, I don't attend church but I still pray and honor God in a Christian way.  Secondly, having been a child of the 70's I was exposed to that lovely movie the OMEN.  I only saw bits of the first one, and most of the second.  But in the first one, the main thing I remember is a couple of big Rotties, going after some guy.  Now I could be wrong, they could have been Dobermans, but in my dream language either dog is a agent of the devil.  So  in other words, my dream was cool because the devil was trying to stop me from being happy.  In other words, his goal isn't to have me be an immoral trans-woman, as so many of my highly religious friends have told me so many times.  No his goal is for me to live in despair, and for me to throw everything away.  The dream that he sent out agents to chase me, was pretty cool, it means I am getting close to getting to a better place.  The second dream was not so symbolic, but even more uplifting.  I dreamt that I was having a therapy session with Dr. Sterner about the status of my transition.  Now most of you have no idea who she is, but to me she has a sort of other world existence.  I hate to sound even weirder than usual, but I almost compare it to the same presence of Yoda in the Star wars movies.  She has this presence and this wisdom that just seems to far exceed her diminutive stature.  So I respect her highly due to this perception I have of her.  I don't know what is going to happen to the clinic when she retires.  She is older, and we just lost the Reverend from the board after he finally fully retired.  I hope that the board will continue so that others who come after my journey will still have someone.  Anyway the dream.  She was questioning me on how my progress was doing, it was a little in the future, I had a job, but not much otherwise had changed.  She was telling me how great I was doing with stuff, and that I should be proud of doing this good this soon into my RLT.  She also reminded me I am not a true newbie to the whole process, I had been doing stuff solo for quite awhile now, only trying to be part of the community is new.  It made me really see, if only in a few dreams, that I am getting close, that I do have it better than a whole lot of people out there.  I am one of the lucky few, while I don't come from a highly privledged background, I did achieve quite a bit in my male life, and through working my way up, I learned and earned allot.  Some trans-girls have so little they are forced to sell their bodies on the street for survival, others turn to the demons alcohol and heavy drugs to run from the pain.  I have been raised with enough intestinal fortitude, and given enough opportunity to not be in their awful situations.  I don't think I would survive one day doing what they are doing, and would most likely end up dead quickly.  They have unbelievable courage to just survive, if only they had the opportunity.  That is something, that someday, I would love to change, but first I have to get into a position where I can help them get there.  One of my ambitions is to rise to a position where I can hire some of these girls or give them some opportunity to achieve, maybe a scholarship or some sort of program to help them get off the streets.  I have been really thinking of going back to school, part time to go and finish my degree, not in business, but in social working.  This could be my giving back to the community.  I haven't written or even attempted to write any poems since Wednesday I think.  I think that it is part of this whole big healing process.  I believe I am ready to get back to working on at least one of the books, most likely the story of me.  I am also working on a sci-fi thriller involving gender issues, cloning and DNA testing which should be good, and a book about the life of a salesperson.  I have to go back to my story and do some rewrites on the chapter about before starting RLT full time, the in between time, or to borrow a term sort of a "gender blurr."  It was a confusing time, bouncing in and out of two very specific gender roles in public, and how to relate to everyone.  I have to do some rewrites to the part about coming out, more I have to add, some I have to write for the first time.  While writing it, I predicted what would happen in certain instances, like coming out at work. Unfortunately, for the work prediction I was correct, but now I have to go add the real world details.  I also have to write about my happy life with Co, it was just too hard to write about it before.  And of course I can start writing about my full time RLT.  I promise to include more personal details then I heard Ms. Boylan did in her book, including sex talk.  I think it is important to talk about the aspects of sexuality, how at least I dealt and still deal with sex in this journey, and I have to give you all some reason to buy the book.     I have to go finish getting ready for the great inquisition today.  Today is Paul's memorial service, and I will be seeing extended family for the first time as Ashley.  I feel like I am being called to the Bishops dungeon, they are ready for me with a rack and a bible, waiting  to convert me back to gender congruency.  It should be interesting, and I am sure something that I can write about latter today.  Sorry for such a long post this morning, it is not often I have dreams like that anymore, and I think it is important to be able to write down and share how lucky I feel I am, especially since my writing can be so dark and full of despair at times.  Take care, see you soon, and love to all.

       Ups, downs, and sanitary gifts...  What an up and down last couple of days.  I have a really strong lead on a good job, I am also waiting to hear back about an opportunity for which I have interviewed twice.  I screwed up my pie for the group, ended up making it a Cajun chocolate chip pie, heavily blackened.  Thank God that I had an extra box of mix for banana nut bread hanging around.  I also got my first three unemployment checks today,  I have money coming in again.  Now all I need is to get working again, and I will be back on the road to Trinidad.  The kids were their usual self, happy and restless.  I cannot wait for the warmer weather so we can go do something outdoorsy. The best part will seem very silly to most of you, but it meant allot to me.  Co and I are still trying to be best friends even though our marriage is unofficially over.  She has been uncomfortable with allot of things in my transition, but always has supported me, even if support just meant keeping her mouth shut.  This weekend she brought over some stuff for me to borrow for the banquet next week, I was so happy she would do that.  But the topper of all, and this is silly, she brought me a tampon for my purse.  What better way to blend than to have female sanitary product in your purse.  This way if another woman who only knows me as Ashley, and nothing about my transition, ever runs out herself and asks me, I have one.  I know, I know, you say it's just a tampon.  That's not the case.  It was a non-solicited gift that was given as a sign of approval to my transition status.  In other words she has learned to accept me a little more.  I never thought the gift of a tampon would make me cry,  but it almost did.  It means so much to me that she is in an ok place with my transition, and her gift was a sign she will most likely get there. Hopefully soon she will soon be able to call me Ashley, up to now it has been too painful for her.  Support group was good, last topic was great.  We were talking about getting your life back to where you were as man, but this time as a woman.  It was so good to hear success a story.  Also one of the senior members talked about how she and her ex are still best friends, another ray of hope.  Take care, I have to go mentally prepare for the big memorial service tomorrow and some uneducated, unsolicited advice from extended family.  Love to all.

       Lean pocket with a side of old memories...  A little while ago I just finished my lunch, a Philly cheese steak lean pocket, in homage to all my brothers and sisters attending the conference in Philly, I hope they all get there and back safely.  Anyway, I turned on the TV, and it was still on espn from watching the Uconn game last night.  All of a sudden I was brought back about two years, and to these old memories.... My son had been born in late February 2002, a beautiful, healthy child.  About 10 days after he was born, I figured it was time to get traveling again for work, and headed to Vermont, not easy to do when you have such a precious gift.  I had made a few stops in the Brattleboro area, dodging snowflakes and trying to stay on the road.  I was crossing Hogsback mountain heading to Bennington, not advisable in a snow storm.  I was about half-way up when my cell phone rang, it was Co.  My son had taken ill, and was being admitted to the hospital.  I hope to God, that I never have that awful feeling of utter despair, and helplessness I felt at that moment, and for the 2+ hours it took me to get home, at inadvisable speed, even in dry conditions.  I did get there ok, found Co and my son and had her just about calaspe in tears in my arms.  It was one of the hardest sights I ever saw, there in an oxygen tent lay my 10 day old son, so beautiful, so helpless.  He had been diagnosed with RSV, a potentially fatal respiratory virus he picked up from someone who should not had visited us in the maternity ward whose daughter had the same virus.  I calmed Co down, and told her she should go home, relax and shower, come back latter, I'd take care of him for now.  It was so hard to see him so sick at such a young age, he had to stay in an oxygen tent to stay alive, and had an oxygen tube for extra help.  The only time he came out, was to be changed and to be fed.  Co and I took shifts staying with him, so he would never be alone, as we were not sure he would be coming home again.  I had days, and would read, and watch the NCAA basketball conference finals, while he slept.  One time while feeding him, I still had the game on, and I noticed he was watching.  There I was, dealing with all the issues from his illness, and my own life direction, bonding with my son.  For the rest of the days he was in the hospital we would watch basketball together.  I am sure he couldn't even see the TV clearly, but he was instead attracted to the sound and movements, but it didn't matter.  I was male bonding with my son, one of the few times in my life I have been able to do so, and one of the last too.  I can still bond with the boy, and do man stuff with him.  I will be taking he, and my daughter fishing on opening day next month.  It is just not the same, I feel so bad sometimes, I cannot provide for him a male role model, only another female one.  He got better, even though on his second to last day, he was on the verge of death his oxygen level had gotten so low that if it continued to drop he would be dead.  I am sure he was healed by the power of prayer, combined with the power of science. The little shit fought like hell, and he is a strong boy today from it.  I hope we can make even more memories together in the future. I remember how I felt normal for just a few days,sitting there, feeding my son, while watching some basketball together. This incident delayed me coming out for a little while longer, it was an oasis in a desert of  non gender congruent confusion.  But you can't stay on the oasis forever, and my issues with congruency grew stronger afterwards.  OMG, sorry for losing thought process a couple of times, I actually started crying while re-living the whole incident while writing.  I am so lucky and blessed to have these memories, but they do have an edge to them that still cuts.

       I am lucky...  Was thinking about the whole message board thing most of last night and this morning.  It made me realize how lucky I am.  I hopefully won't end up bitter and hateful of other groups of transgendered people like some I was arguing with.  I have been met with nothing but open arms by all in this community so far.  It is such a wonderful feeling to after so many years of being alone, have a group of peers, some who someday may become true friends.  I feel sorry for those who continued to shut themselves off and hide in isolation, instead of sunning themselves in the warm rays of inclusion.  I also feel sorry for those who are living in such denial of what they are.  I am still getting messages from a few souls saying that "they are or will be true women after surgery."  I hate splitting hairs.  Do we all want to be treated like women?  You bet your ass !  But some people think that this means that the whole trans experience will just go away, they will have no issues from the transition.  I find this unhealthy and unrealistic. I even had one response that if someone invented a time machine, they could go back and make sure they were born a real woman.  Ok, now putdown the bong, and get back to reality.  I used to feel this same way, but why in the world would I want to go back and change things?  Yes my life sucks sometimes, but I can think of three reasons right off the top of  my head, that stops the thoughts of turning back time: co, and our two kids.  Not to mention all my friends through the years. This is the road less traveled we read about, it is a hard one, but the journey is so right when you look back on it.  Back to the whole state of denial stuff. I usually am not one to judge others, but I will in this case, be ok with what you are, you don't have to go march in parades if you don't wish to, but be proud.  We have a really big major difference between us and a normal woman, we worked our asses off to get there, they did no work at all, they were just born that way.  We should be proud that we made it through adversity and were made better for it.  I am sorry to leave out my trans-brothers of this conversation, you guys have a tougher trip than we do. I hope I can finnish this and get back to some poetry, have the kids and co tonite, support group tomorrow, and I'm bringing homemade pie.  Take care and love to all.

       What we have here, is failure to communicate...  I just had the worse day ever on one of my support group boards, and its not quite 6pm yet.  I will not go into full detail,since it is not ethical to bring too many details off the board, and support groups. Basically someone on the board who is a post-op TRANSSEXUAL, threw a GD hissy fit when someone used the term TRANSGENDERED.    She flew off the handle and after several attempts by myself and others to make her see it was just term that did not define her existence, she chose to leave the board. We not only defended the term, but the fact that crossdressers are people to.  She used some interesting words, like we were "wannabes, since we identified with the trans-gender term".  She actually was quite nasty to me for my admittance that early in my transition that I cross dressed.  She was so full of hate and bitterness towards what she described as "fetish-ists".  She was also under the illusion that she was better than us all, because of her beliefs and that she is post op, and me being the loudest voice,as always, was a "pre op who has not been there yet".  I inadvertently sparked further debate when in my trying to explain to her, surgery did not make her a "real woman", you know like this earlier life had all been a bad dream and never happened or something.  People can get so nervy about terms and labels, that it distracts from the things we all share.  I also pissed off at least one person who got upset about me calling God a she.  Hey if they can assume, God is a man, I can assume her to be a woman.  I mean have they seen God?  Did God appear to them naked or something?  We need to take a second and just think about stuff sometimes, and question stuff.  Who knows what sex God is? I myself don't know what sex God is, I hope I don't get to meet him or her and find out for a while. I only used the female pronoun because it felt right while writing it.  Most people think God is man, because that is what they taught us.  They also tried to teach us if we were just a little tougher, we could be real men.   Some also tried to teach us, that we are sick and perverted in what we are doing, and with prayer we could be healed.   Or that if we just loved a little harder we could overcome these feelings.  One tried to teach me that I was gay, and I should be with them to see if I liked it (true story, worst counselor ever). I am tired of everyone being so accepting of all the stuff they are taught.  Doesn't anyone learn on their own anymore, take time to look around, explore?  Wow, Ok, I can breathe now.  Sorry for the rant, I just had to blow steam, and I didn't want to add fuel to the fire on the board.  Take care, and love to all.

       Proud of my mom...  Just got back from seeing mom, we talked, we shared memories, we ate my stew, she cried, I comforted her.  I helped her with some fixing stuff around the house, just because I paint my nails, doesn't mean I forgot home improvement skills.  Anyway, one of the things I helped her with was taking some old photos of the old me out of the living room.  She is having a memorial for Paul on Sunday, and wants me there.  Some of my relatives will be there, and most don't know about Ashley, none have met me as Ashley.  It should be a really interesting afternoon.  I will be respectful for mom, and not make a scene.   I am so proud of her too!  While I was visiting she used all the proper pronouns.  We had others come over, her neighbor and the hospital Chaplin.   She called me her daughter and hit every she on cue, I was so happy I almost cried on the way home.   Sunday will be the big test though, I hope it goes well.

       Helping mom...  Just a quick post before going to see mom.  Stew smells delicious, I hope it will cheer her up.  I will work on a poem for her before going, or on the 40 minute drive.  I feel so bad for her, and worse since I had no real connection to the man.  I feel bad for not weeping for him, but I do enough of that for other things.  Should be interesting, I am sure she will once again be calling me by that old name, and using he.  She will just need some time to get used to it, and like I posted in a comment on Jude's board, "who cares what they call us, as long as they love and accept us."   I also heard back from the gal doing the photo project from the transadvocacy news letter, she wants to use me in her shoot.  Funny when you think about it, if I had just been born an average, white, middle class guy nobody would take the time to even look at my site, or want me for a photo project.  Being transsexual in a weird way good sometimes. It has taught me about diversity, compassion, and humility.  It has taught me that nothing in this life is black or white, just a rainbow of colors.  It has taught me not to judge others, for what I have been taught by society to be wrong. I've learned that  people may do "weird" things for totally sane reasons.  It has gotten me in touch with some really awesome people I would not have met.  It has taught me to look inside myself, to see what it is that I wish to accomplish with my life. It has awakened me and made me alive. So many people sleep walk through this life.  I have learned to soak it all in, and love every moment, happy or sad.  It has also taught me that no one person is bigger than the community, in other words we all need each other.  One person can't take on the world on their own and win,but band together and watch out!  We all have been given certain gifts from God, we just need to try and use them to help others.  Be it a stupid little site trying to reach out to the genetically gender congruent, or something greater like Calpernia sharing her story with the world.  We all can make a dent if we work together towards that common goal. I am so glad that I have a place to share my works, and an audience for them, as limited as they may be. I really hope I can change just one persons perspective about us, that we aren't just a Jerry Springer freak show, but real people, hurt, afraid, scared, but full of dreams and aspirations.  I hope I am providing something to all of you who are spending a few precious minutes to check my site, now get back to work and play some solitaire.  Love to all.

       Change of plans...  Mom had to go to the funeral home with Paul's kids, I didn't want to rock the boat, so I stayed home.  I went down to the store and got the ingredients for my special chicken stew.  It takes a while to cook, so I will cook it up tonite and bring it over to her tomorrow for lunch.  For some reason, that stew usually is a pretty good pick me up.  You may not know it from looking at me, but I am a pretty good cook, and love food. I stay slim because I just make sure I eat healthy food, not junk, & exercise.  It is not my metabolism as both my younger sister and my parents are a little heavy.  My brother and I though really take care of ourselves and are the fit ones.  I am posting my recipe on my site to share.  We all have times where we need comfort food.  This recipe makes a fair amount of stew, so have room in your freezer.    ASHLEY'S HAPPY PLACE CHICKEN STEW   1lb Season Chicken cut into pieces. 1pkg Lipton Pasta Sides Chicken flavor 2-7oz cans of carrots 2-7oz cans of corn 4oz Penne 1-15oz can chicken broth 2-15oz cans chicken gravy( I use low/no fat) 4-med potatoes 1-splash olive oil ¼ cup chopped green onion 6 cups water ¼ cup flour 2 pinches garlic powder 2 pinches Italian seasoning 2 pinches black pepper 1 pinch salt 1 pinch dried minced onion  In a large stockpot place drained canned vegetables, olive oil, spices, water, gravy and penne. Cook green onions in a skillet, and add to pot.  Cut chicken into small ½ inch pieces and season with favorite seasoning.  I prefer a taco seasoning mixed with ½ cup of lemon lime soda.  Cook chicken in skillet, cool drain, add to pot.  Prepare Pasta sides per directions, add to pot.  Cook on high for 10 minutes, stirring often. Sift in flour. Reduce heat to medium and cover for 25minutes stir occasionally.  Add chicken broth. Place on low heat for at least 1 more hour, stirring occasionally.  Enjoy.

       A journey ends, and another begins...  I just got off the phone with my mom, Paul lost his fight with cancer today.  I read her the four different poems I wrote about how he possibly felt, from our conversations.  He had been full of remorse, regret and sadness.  I found it hard to relate, but still drew some similarities in our situations. She loved each one, I thought they were subpar and felt not a really strong connection to them. I also feel bad, I didn't have the courage to introduce him to Ashley, he only knew the old me.  I kept my distance as Ashley as not to upset him, nor make his last days uncomfortable.  I will share the four poems I wrote for Paul, three serious and one for fun.  God-speed to him, I have a feeling Dale Ernhardt was there to drive him home.   Life's final journey..    As life's final journey is about to begin, I look back on it. And its lessons soak in. Sorry I failed to make good,  On relations turned bad. Sorry for friends lost,  And for ones I never had.  I cannot change my past, For its story is written. I can't go back and say sorry then. For theses sins I committed.  At times I was quick to anger, But now I feel love. At times I lived like a hawk, But now I'm a dove.  Yes I was not perfect,  No man is nor will ever be. I just hope you know how much I cared. And what you meant to me.  A man's dying wish, Sometimes gets met with rejection. Some think it's a stall, At life's last big connection.  My feelings are true, My heart remains free. Though my mind might be bogged down, In the history of me.   I ask for your love, I ask for your kindness. I understand your caution, I forgive all your shyness.  I hope you'll forgive, These things that I've done, I hope we can heal, And with life move on.  Life's final journey  Is about begin, I hope you remember my love, And not just my sin.  God will forgive us all, If our hearts to him are true. I will be waiting up there patiently, For the arrival of you.  I must go, he approaches, He's come to take my hand. Leading me on my final journey, To life eternal's promised land.     My legacy...    Regret, Remorse, Bitterness,  Regret, Life's bitter pill, That's hard to swallow. But a riteous path is winding, And always hard to follow.  Remorse, Lost thoughts about, Life's chances not taken. The decisions we've made, Our intentions mistaken.  Bitterness, A long lasting fire, In a pit of despair. No water can quell it, It burns without air.  These things I leave, Behind me I trust. As I ask for forgiveness, From he who is just.  I ask for forgiveness, From both he and you. I know that its late, But my intentions our true.  Learn from my mistakes, That's my legacy for you. Try not to repeat them, Heed them in what you do.  My life is over, My chances now gone. Please grant me forgiveness, So you can move on.  Move on before the three curses, Infect you and spread. A fill you with hate, And clog up your head.  Regret, Remorse, Bitteness. They are always looking to stay, I just hope that you've learned. How to turn them away.     Life,   Bitter sweet memories, Of life's high expectations. Loving longing fondness, To right what was wrong. Can't go back and change, Time has run short. All I can do now is hope. Hope for forgiveness, For love, For redemption. Hope that my love, Was felt in return. For as hard as I found it, To say how I felt, I always cared. Never good with words, I kept silent, Afraid to reach out, For fear I would fall. I've made some mistakes, Some I regret. But they are mine, And define who I was, Learn from them, Accept me for me. And our love, Don't forget.       NASCAR     I wish life were like NASCAR, With more than one trip round  This great track. With time to fix things, Without going back. We'd run at full speed Through curves straights and bends. With a little help  From some of our friends  My friends and I would draft, Down that big straight away. We'd take over the lead, We'd win on that day.  But life's not like NASCAR, This is a one-lap track, So enjoy the view now, So you won't have to look back.  Life's like a race, But more of a journey, So stay off the walls, And off of the gurney.  We don't know where, Our finish lines lay. Just enjoy life, Especially on race day.   Love to all, I have to go comfort mom.

       Hard to find the words...  Believe it or not I sometimes get writers block.  And when I get writers block , I use... Sorry the joke just came to me.  I've written about my mother's common law husband being on his death bed to you all, and told you how I shared a special poem with her that I wrote for this site.  After her request to read a few others she asked me to write one for him.  Not an easy request, to write a poem for someone from their perspective.  For me writing is not about just sitting down and creating, for me writing comes when it comes, it just starts and I let it flow.  I compare it to channeling a spirit like a physic or medium would.  But I am channeling my feelings and emotions, sometimes I can place myself in someone else's shoes and write from their point of view, but only if I can relate to them.  I cannot relate to this man,  he is about to die a bitter man, full of remorse.  I am trying to fix my issues now, not in my last years, because I might be already in my last years.  We never know when we are to go, and life is to short for pain.  That is why I can't relate to this man.  I use my poetry to exercise my feelings of ill and bitterness, to let them from my heart and set them free, he let them fester and blacken his heart and soul.  I will continue to try to write something, but it is for my mom, who I love dearly, not for him.

       Reflections...  A new friend and mentor has a birthday today, and I thought about how I use my own birthdays now to reflect and do an annual self check.  While doing my normal am exercise bike routine, I came up with this little poem.  I think its important for anyone to just do a little reflection from time to time.  It helps bring us down to reality, instead of being bogged down in perceived troubles not there, or that we are bigger and more important then we really are.  On a personal note, I have also decided to submit my application for the photo essay project in the transadvocacy newsletter. I am pretty vanilla in the whole gender realm, so I don't know if I will be useful. But you know, I could pose in my shortest skirt while posing with my hockey stuff. ;) Those who know what I look like now, I am sure got a chuckle.  I was never a big guy, just a little rough around the edges.  Now though I look like a girly girl a little too much for some.  I will send it in anyway, maybe some nice pictures of me outside, my pad, my pen and a poem.  Take care, and of course love to all.   Reflection     I look into the mirror, And what do I see? The events of my life, And the history of me.  I've savored the good, I've handled the bad. I look back with fondness, Of the adventures I've had.  I think of the present, And how I got here. I think of the future, And my reflection next year.  I think of old dreams, Whether they came true or not. I can't win them all, And I love what I've got.  I think of new dreams, And how to achieve them. With out giving up what I have, Or forgetting where I've been.  No matter what I try, I can never turn back the hands of time. But hey, I am eternally grateful. For my life's reflection, since it's all mine.

       The other side of the pain...  One of the hardest things in dealing with this dilemma is not only the trails and tribulations that we ourselves go through but our so's also.  It pains me greatly to see what I effect I have had on my life.  She doesn't quite understand how I could be happy and have had happy times in our marriage,but be at the same time so unhappy with myself.  It is hard for those of us non-congruent people to understand, nevermind for those who have not experienced it firsthand.  I can't blame her one bit, I can't imagine being in her position anymore than she can imagine being in mine. We still are trying to work out certain aspects of where we go from here, and how handle parts of our lives together we wish to still hold on to.  It will be a tough road, and it will take some time to just being friends after being friends and more.  I found this poem she had sent me back in the summer of last year, it shows just a little taste of the pain the other side goes through when we transition.  Hope you enjoy her honesty and vulnerability as much as I do.   I've thought about   I've thought about you, I've thought about me. I've thought about the way, Things were supposed to be.  I've thought about her,(our daughter) I've thought about him.(our son) I thought about how, And exactly what we'd tell them.  I'm so grateful, For all the times we've had, But looking into the future, Makes me kind of sad.  We were supposed to grow old together, Our lives as husband and wife, To be shared forever.  But now our futures, Are quite uncertain. Sort of hid, Like behind a curtain.  I look at couples everywhere, And can't help to start and think, Why us and not them? It makes my heart start to sink.  I know none of this is your fault, And a decision needs to be made. But for now I think friends we should be, And anything else later we'll see.  I've been very distant, This I know. But my feelings and emotions, Are hard to show.  When I think about things, Its like a flood, Almost as hard, As drawing one's own blood.  Our lover is so powerful, That's why it's so hard. To stop being man and wife, And each start a new life.  I love you so much, I never want to lose touch.  Please bear with me, As I learn to cope. And try to shower me, With a little hope.  I'll try to be more open. I'll try to talk. About the things we need to say, I hope you know I love you now, And will every day.

       New and Improved?...  Ok two big changes here today.  First, following the lead and thought it might be good to have the ability to get comments like a friend of mine recently did on hers. Fire away, I not only can dish it out, I can take it.  If you guys use it, I will at least know someone is reading this other than me and two other people.  Secondly if you like the poetry but not the commentary, look to your right and you will notice a just poetry link where I have put on all my poetry and that sent to me.  I hope whoever is reading this is at least enjoying it.  Take care and love to all.

       A ride on the rollercoaster of life...   Transsexuals -we have more moods before noon, than most people have in a day! -   Ok, ok, I sometimes have more mood changes then most do in a day, sorry for including my sisters and brothers.   I had a really cool thing happen when I went to leave for my interview this am.  It snowed last night, for those of you not in the area, and I had to clean off my car.  Two cars away from my was one of my neighbors cleaning her car off.  As she saw me start to clean mine, we started to chat back and forth about this awful weather.  I was so freaking thrilled, that she felt ok to talk to me.  Either she doesn't know I used to be a guy, or she doesn't care.  I only lived there for a few months in my old male role, and kept a low profile, so who knows.  I know it sounds trivial to allot of you, but general acceptance into mainstream society is a big thing to some of us.  Some actually do enjoy messing with peoples heads, and do the whole gender outlaw full time, that is just not me.  I am a  gender jaywalker  if anything, I want to fit in, but I do like to mess with someone every now and then, just to stay sane.  I cannot change what I am, nor do I feel ashamed about who I am.  I AM A TRANSEXUAL, AND I AM PROUD I HAD THE BALLS TO PURSUE GETTING RID OF SAID BALLS.  I do wish though, for now, to quietly fit in, and get a little taste of what I was cheated out of in this life.  Life is so fluid, and changing where I end up on the whole outlaw or in will take time, along with allot of other things too.   I do not feel I did so good at the interview, no connection felt between he and I.  I have a suspicion I was filler anyway, I didn't meet a few requirements.  I will continue and I will prevail.  I have had the drive and determination to go this far, I refuse to give up yet.   I also now find myself looking forward to my night with the girls next Saturday at the banquet.  I was hesitant since while I did crossdress, I did it to get my mind and body a little closer, most crossdressers do it for other reasons.  But I am all about diversity and learning so I am looking forward to it.  And hey, does it really matter why you're a man in a dress?  No just accept it and know there are all kinds of people that turn this world round.  At the very least I might make a friend or two, and get to work on how to act as a female at a formal function.   Oh great, lets see, where should I learn to be more lady like?  Oh I know, by hanging out with some drag queens!   Wow my mood is very sarcastic and fun today.  I hope that anyone who reads things here, if anyone is around that is, they are not offended by my jests.  Everything, ok mostly everything I post, is out of love.  And if you knew me personally, you would know that my biggest target for ridicule is myself, and I love to be ribbed as much as I love to ribb.

       So little time...  Ok the interview stampede begins again.  I have at least two interviews today,as I continue on my quest to interview for every open sales position in New England.  Can't talk much now, but wanted to give those I AIM with heads up about my whereabouts.  Decided last night to go to the COS banquet after meeting a very nice CD at electrol.  I wasn't sure I was going to go until I found a really nice formal dress I bought on sale at Filene's last spring.  I don't know what it was that made me buy it, other than the fact it was like 70% off.  I'm glad I bought it, I need a night to forget my woes, if even for a few hours.  I wouldn't have been able to go out and get something right now to wear, so I lucked out.  I will talk more latter, sorry I didn't post last night.  My mom and I talked for a while, and I made her cry with my poem "the last".  I had planned on sharing it when I saw her on Sunday, but she wasn't in the right frame of mind.  Usually she calls me by my birth name half the time, and my new name the other half, she was so upset, it was the old name and he all the time.  I won't hold it against her, the man she loves is dieing in a hospital bed of cancer, and he is so drugged up she can't even say goodbye.  Mom loved the poem and wants me to print it up for her.  I am trying to help her plan his memorial service. He wasn't my favorite person that mom dated after she and my dad divorced, but she loved him very much, so there had to be some good there.  Take care and love to all.  !!!Come on send your poems in !!!!

       OMG, did I say that...  Just got back from my hearing, shocked the gal,she had no idea I wasn't one of the genetically gender congruent.  I guess I must be looking good today, even though I thought I looked like our lieutenant governor, Jody Rell.  Won't know results till end of this week early next.  Guess I won't be riding that   long black train   quite yet. (sorry to the non-country music fans who don't get that reference.)  I would say it went well though, and I should be OK.  On my way out I did something I don't even believe I would do.  I was walking out, and this young nice looking man of color yelled out from his parked car "hey baby, you wanna go for a ride"?  Well my first heckle, or cat call, wow I felt and still feel special indeed.  Well with me still being in my non-stealth mindset, even though I was dressed up and looking  about 1/2 way decent, I just had to have some fun with this young strapping man.  I replied to Mr. Charming, " sure but only if I can drive honey!", oh did I mention I was using my deepest old male voice I could muster.  He just about turned white the poor fellow, and the passenger started laughing so hard he probably wet himself. I hope I don't come across as being racist, I love all colors, he just happened to heckle the wrong gal today. I never thought I would ever be a genderfuck, but I at least can say I did it once.  Gotta go to what will most likely be my last electro marathon for awhile.  I need to cut back on some stuff right now, until I get back in the realm of the employed.  I will in some weird way miss it, because we do talk like two old women, and I really get a kick out of that.  I eventually soon go back, its only temporary. This little bitch will be back. Take care all.

       Crunch time...  Had a little moment before the hearing, and an idle mind, well at least my idle mind, gets me in trouble.  I hate the waiting shit and this hearing decides allot.  I went to kill some time by cleaning out my old mailbox from my old male days.  I thought it was amazing the amount of penis enhancement e-mails, if they only knew.  I usually just delete them, but a few had funny subject lines that I just thought I had to share.    Grow a new p***y ripping whale dick.  Help! Aliens grew my cock overnight.  You can poke someone's eye out with that thing      Wow they have a way with words.  Funny how these guys have a job in marketing, while I can't seem to get a job selling newspaper advertising, go figure. Firstly  if the products worked like that, I'm sure they would have some clients from our ftm brothers.  Secondly I think that second one they stole from one of my dreams about the bugger growing back!  Lastly I am half tempted to try them, I mean the longer it is now, the deeper you are latter. Oh by the way,  that edit on the first one is mine, I have a little issue with that word.  Weird thing to have an issue with it, and I didn't even know I had one until my brother told me of a p***y party he attended for another trans person.  (small world, I now talk to this person)  Anyway, I was offended by his overuse of the word.  He is not your typical male pig, so I know it wasn't him it was the word.  I haven't even gotten mine yet, and I am already watching out for it.  Wish me luck, if it doesn't go well, forgive me in advance for my rants, raves, or anything else stupid I may do. Love to all, Ashley

       Little stupid hurdles...  OK some times life throws you something stupid and trival that just pisses you off more than it should.  I have taken down the music since it was kidnapping people and taken them away into the land of ads.  Sorry if I sent you there.

       Another day, another opportunity...  Just a quickie, getting ready for my hearing today at unemployment, they don't want to pay me right now.  I already got a real interesting reply from the girl on the phone when I informed her they were sending stuff to my wife's house instead of mine.  I got"excuse me you said your wife, I have you listed as a female." To which I had to tell her about me being trans, and she told me" hey it's your decision, I won't judge you."  Good to now at least one gal at unemployment approves of me.  Should be fun, time to get into be proud to be trans mode, not stealth today.  Yesterday was HELL, I was an emotional mess.  Did my bills and watched my funds shrinking and my wait for surgery growing.  I actually broke down and cried hard, almost to the point of vomiting.  I calmed myself down, went to my happy place, and got myself together and a glass of water.  While drinking my water I looked down at my pill organizer and noticed I had forgotten to take any of my pills today, and it was 7 at night.  HOLY SHIT, its no matter I was a total fucking freak.  I've seen in the past how much hormones can mess with your head, but oh my God, this was scary.  I will be ten times more diligent on making sure I have taken them from now on.  Oh and by the way, I am better today.  I was looking for my name change paper, and my clinic letter that certifies me as a "freak", when I came across some good shit.  I will share a bunch of it latter, one of the poems I want to put on was written by Co and I want to make sure she's ok with it.  But I found this quote I had from a while back.  I can't be totally sure,but I am 99.9% sure this is one of my quotes I wrote, just from the way it was on a page.  Whether it is mine or not I just had to share it.  I truly hope that someone out there is reading this, if so tell a friend or two, and hopefully they do the same.  I really would love to have more people share their stuff, the more you guys send in, the less time I have to bore you with my life.  Take care, love to all, and I'll be back.     I know it is not going to be easy where I am going, but I am not going there looking for easy, I am going there because it is where I belong.

       Another weekend shot...  Kids and 'Co gone early as usual.  I should have taken my skates out of storage on Friday, I could have gone out and exercised my blues away.  The kids keep acting up, and I feel so bad when I have to discipline them.  What kind of memories are they going to have of me, when I have to yell at them so much?  There are no other children in my apartment building, and I don't want to give anyone a reason to get rid of me, I like where I live.  I think it would be difficult to find a place with the same features as this one for the same price. I have some deep thinking to do this week, Co and I are thinking of dropping their visits to every other week.  While it would break my heart to do that, if I knew it was best for them, I would do it in a heartbeat.  I have been a selfish person in how I handled my affliction all these years.  I have continually just tried to "do the right thing", to fit in and be a real man, and have just dragged others into my world of pain.  I need to make sure that I do what is the very best for my kids now.  I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE, AND I WILL AGAIN, I DO NOT REGRET HAVING MY KIDS, I love them and I thank God for them everyday.  I do regret the fact that I have made their lives difficult, and want to make sure they don't get damaged from my being trans, but instead learn to embrace people for what is on the inside.  I have started thinking again about moving down south.  I have several different opportunities available to me down there, and I could just go and make a clean start.  I have a few problems with that though.  First one is I couldn't imagine only seeing my kids once or twice a year, it would hurt like hell.  But again if it was for their best interest I would do it.  Secondly, I have a nice group of friends up here who don't care about my being different.  I have just started making friends in the trans community, and there are many possibilities and options open up here for friendships and relationships I may not even know are just around the bend.  And finally, even though there are more, I can't be a chicken shit and run away from my troubles.  That is what dragged others into this in the first place, me trying to hide from my demons.  I just need to step up and be a woman about it, stop being such a male about things.  I think this is a healthier attitude to have of late, and I have already learned how being a woman is a much tougher thing than being a man is, and then add trans on top of that.  I was told recently by one of my new friends that she thought I might have some trouble dealing with the whole differences after having certain privledges as a man.  She has no idea how right she was.  I am having so much trouble having people take me seriously as a woman trying to find a sales job.  Firstly I am very tired of getting calls from people who saw my resume and want to talk to me about an inside sales position.  Ok now boys, girls can go out on the road and sell too, they not only let us drive now, but we can vote too.  And if the position is for a serious outside sales position my whole personality sends up a red flag to allot of people.  I would never have called myself aggressive or pushy in my handling of myself when I was a man.  Now that I have transitioned though I have a little bit more confidence, I am as I always have been persistent.  Not to mention the fact that I will work for someone like it was my own business.  I love to sit and listen so I can debate and will share my input during a conversation.  I am finding they have a word for women like me; confident, persistent, hard working, has a mind of her own...."Oh you're a BITCH."  I guess I am going to have to find a middle ground and soften myself up just a bit.  Some people can't handle a success driven, hard working, woman with an opinon.  Its sad to admit, but if I was still male, I would have had a job weeks ago.  I admire the people who have beaten the system and succeeded anyway.  That is one of the reasons you will see a few names under people I admire.  Lynn Conway is there since she showed her old company that she could still work and not only survive but thrive in her old field.  Another one Jude, who also gave me the above advice, has her own business from before her transition. Of course Jude is up there for other reasons, like her giving to the community, and for showing me its ok to be trans and talk freely about her own sexuality.  "Girl you lead by example, thanks, I hope I am as comfortable with my own someday, and figure out my own team, as I want to get the right jersey."  It took allot of balls ladies to do it in a mans and non trans run world, thanks for the inspiration.  I think it funny that some of the people I know with the biggest balls, no longer have a physical set. I too think I grew a mental set, once I accepted that I needed to get rid of my God given ones.  Anyway, I also need to go see my dad and find some old pictures.  I am particularly interested in one of me at 4 years old on Halloween.  That year I actually convinced my parents to let me go trick or treating as Raggedy Ann.  Hell yeah, I was a four year old cross dresser!  If they only knew then, what they know now.  I also want to find an earlier picture I remember seeing of a two year old me wearing one of my moms old wigs.  Mom had allot of bad perms back in the 70's and still to this day keeps a wig or two around just in case.  When I figure out how to post a picture on here, I will post them so you can chuckle.  If anyone has any suggestions let me know.  Oh well gotta go take on the day, get ready for one of my few old male rituals I still love nascar, I love both Mark Martin, and Matt Kensith.  Hmm, viagra and smirnoff are there sponsors, maybe its a sign.  I also need to prepare for a hard day tomorrow.I have a big hearing in the early afternoon, followed by electro marathon late afternoon.  I guess she will be working on my neck since I have to go out before, thank God for turtlenecks. Oh before I forget, I finally found the presentation on disk I did for my old work about being trans, it is pretty funny as far as powerpoint goes.  On my presentation I found three of my most favorite quotes, and I have to share them, they are words that inspired me. Take care, and love to all.  The game of life is not so much in holding a good hand as playing a poor hand well. H. T. Leslie   A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty. Sir Winston Churchill  No matter what we have come through,or how many perils we have safely passed, or how imperfect and jagged our life has been, we cannot in our heart of hearts imagine how it could have been different.  As we look back on  it, it slips in behind us in orderly disarray, and with all its mistakes, acquires a sort of eternal fitness,and even, at times, a poetic glamour.

       Just a quickie...  Sorry folks, kids and spouse are over, not much time today.  Wanted to share a quick little poem I wrote last night, after a talk my spouse and I had last night.  Still no change of plans, we are still planning on making separation permanent through divorce. Its a little tough sometimes, but we both will make it through just fine.     Healing   First comes, The over abundance feeling of pain. It takes hold of me, And consumes my soul. It drags me down, Deep, Into my pit of despair.  Down, Down, It weighs on my soul, my heart. Slowly it cuts off  Feelings. Until I am  Completely, Utterly, Numb.  As I sit on the bottom, And look up, From my pit of despair. Hope's light up above, Twinkles, And beckons me, Upward.  Warmth fills me again, I start to climb, As I reach one hand  up, onto the cold rock, then another. But as I get closer,  and start to absorb Hope's light, It soon fills me so much. I start to float, Float as if a feather, Caught on a summer breeze. Filled with emotions, I start to rise. I get closer to the light, Our distance quickly shrinks. Higher, Higher I float,  Then fly. Finally, Exploding, With a supernova  of feelings and creative expression. They rush out of me, Like rythmatic explosions of orgasms.  Now out of my pit of despair, And all bad feelings released. I slowly float, Back down, To solid ground. I land on my feet, And  continue my journey, On life's great path. Healed.

       Ok, so I lied...  Had a moment while letting lunch cool, and thought I'd throw up a quick thought.  I know now that at least some of my friends and ex coworkers are reading this, so thank you.  I have also gotten so many interesting comments about stuff.  Like the fact that I can be happy or sad in different posts on the same day.  Well I could blame the hormones, but I am all about accountability, so I will blame me being human.  My emotions are going up and down, and I am a very open and emotional person, it is my way to heal, so hang in there.  I am quite sane, I have gotten my crying out of the way, and getting my life put back on track.  I think I have healed pretty quickly considering.  All you genetically gender congruent people out there have no idea how much it hurts to loose so much in just trying to be yourself.  Some trans people don't even know, but they are the lucky few, and I myself am luckier than most.  Most have no people in their life, I do, most people can't see their kids, I do.  Most people have trouble finding work, I am being picky.  Allot of people have trouble blending and going "stealth", while I don't think I can go stealth completely yet, I have it so much better than some others.    Please don't take anything as an insult, I am growing tired of having to apologize or clarify things.  Please just remember that I am human, my emotions are appropriate for the scale of things going on, and I will be just fine.  I am still saddened by how some things in my life have panned out, but that what life is all about.  Life tends to make us stronger thru the fires of adversity, so we may overcome them and rise to bigger and better things.  What is my bigger and better thing?  Who knows, I will be ready for it when it comes.  Oh, oh gotta go, or I'll have cold spaghetti o's. Threw this one together quickly while sending out resumes.   Inventory   As I look at my life right now, It lays in pieces, Scattered around me on a large wooden floor. I pick up the pieces one by one, Check them out, And take inventory.  I count up the blessings, Against the curses. I count up the friends, Against the enemies. I count the possibilities, Against the roadblocks. And take stock of my life.  I place all the good pieces of my life, Into a large wooden box.   They fill the box so much I cannot close it. I start to sweep up the bad pieces, and as I gather them up  I am puzzled. For as much trouble as these pieces caused, And as much as they weighed on my heart, my soul, There really weren't all that much to them.  As I throw them upward, And scatter them to the wind. I am glad to find, That in my life's inventory,  The pieces of good, Outweighed the bad.

       Can't change the past...  Ok so I lied, I am back just to say that I have removed the "racy Ashley awards" post from my site.  I talked this morning with a friend who thought it did more harm than good for "the cause".  In my belief that no one is bigger than the community, I took it down.  While it was fun to post, and I really don't think many are seeing this site, due to the lack of feedback I  receive, I still took it down.  I will be happy to share it with anyone who requests it from me via e-mail.  Back to the job hunt, six resumes sent already, I love technology.

       Time to reflect and regroup...  Ok I am going to take a little time off from this site, so as to take some time and reflect.  I also need to get a job soon if I am going to make my goal of surgery in 2005.  I have some savings but if I don't get something soon, I will have tapped them to far to recoup.  I am not going to find a job here, unless a publisher stumbles upon my site, and enjoys my rantings and prose.  I highly doubt that, I doubt many people are reading at all.  Ok off to the job hunt, take care, and see you in a bit. Love to All.

       Back to our regular programming...  Ok folks with all that out of the way( see post below this one) I want to share two pieces about hurtful words.  The first one I wrote today on my way to my interview as a lashing out at the people I intended to insult.  It made me so pissed off, that in my words to them, I hurt other people who wrongly included themselves with them.  I am so mad that some people have hurt me so GD much that I find myself filled with hate, and creating more hate inadvertently.  So anyway I can't ever remember writing 5 poems in a day since the big p hit, and I was so upset about the whole thing.  Unfortunately all those works are lost forever, I gave them to a girl who lost them.  I am really sad that I have nothing left from that time of my life, it was such a raw, rough emotional time, even more than now.  Oh well enjoy.  Oh and this is mainly to my old friends and people who pretended to be friends.  I hope you are smart enough to figure it out, but we haven't talked in so long, you don't even know about this address, so please to all don't be hurt by...  Hurtful words   I tried to tell you how I felt. You chose not to listen.  You now come back to check in, Full of morbid curiosity. Only now to see, My words hurtful to you.  Words I kept in, Feelings I repressed. I was trying to be nice, I was trying to get along. Kept telling myself, "Its all for the best."  I couldn't do it any longer, Bad hurt feelings, Got worse and grew stronger, Slowly Sprouting Into  hurtful words.  Don't be so vain, To think its all about you. That when I say  hurtful words Their pointed to you, Alone. Allot of people have hurt me, Allot of old friends now gone away. So don't feel so special If I do throw  your way, A few, Hurtful words.   Ok second one I wrote a while back when I was fighting back and forth verbally with my spouse.  Fighting always tends to hurt so much more when you are doing it with someone you love so much.  I don't have a time frame down other than I believe it was early last year as I signed it with my old male name, enjoy.  Your words have weight   Your words have weight Your opinion to me matters. Your words can hurt or heal... Your words can put down of flatter...  Your words have weight, They just don't drift into the air. They can take me up high... They can crush me into despair...  Your words have weight, They press against my soul. The bad ones tend to pile up fast, And magnify their toll.  Your words have weight, And I am feeling crushed. I try to let them roll off, But they have got me flushed.  Your words have weight, I hope mine do too. And I hope the weight of my words, Lets you know how much I love you.   Bye again for now y'all.

       Time for some clarification...  Ok as if you haven't guessed by now, I have a few "issues" with rejection right now from people in my past both personally and professionally.  It has come to my attention that by me generalizing I have offended some people who I did not intend to do this to.  I have been very careful not to use anyone's real name, unless it is a name only known to them and I.  People should know if they have wronged me or not, so please do not feel included in the insults unless I specifically point you out.  As you can tell on my site I am not a shy person.  So far one of the few people I have outwardly specifically pointed out was my ex coworker tubby.  Sorry there bud but you kind of hurt me allot by "keeping two sets of books" the one you showed to my face, and the other one you used with others behind my back.  I have always been careful who I keep as my friends I let you in, and you disappointed me, so yes I feel you are a prick for that, sorry but I still feel, ok.  I left out a whole bunch of people with direct insults due to the fact that they are not worth anything to me, but several of my old companies business partners were not kind with their words, but I felt them not worth the effort to insult.  I feel so TERRIBLE though that my ex-boss felt included in my insults.  Only a few of you reading this know who he is, and I won't mention him by name, since it doesn't matter, BUT I AM SORRY.  I feel horrible that I offended him with my indirect insults, they were not intentional.  I greatly respect this man, even though I did not see eye to eye with him all the time.  We at times were on opposite ends of things, but I followed this mans lead and he produced and helped me produce.  I hope he did not include himself in my reference to my gaining privilege from "an old school sexist few".  That comment was pointed at my employer before him, that employer moved me up the ladder really quick and over women with more qualifications than I. It was my position in that company that helped me get into my last job.  Every thing I earned in my last job was just by following directions, using my innovation, and working my ass off. My last boss in the job I came from IS NOT A SEXIST.  I used to get in arguments with other people who thought our company was a boys club, it wasn't.  Yes he did get rid of some women, but it wasn't about gender, it was work ethic and production.  I tend to shy away from these conversations when others bring it up, as not to hurt their feelings. I have had time to be dissconected from it, and see it on both sides, so my perception is different than others right up in it.  I have had mixed emotions about my leaving my last job.  Was it about my being trans of course it was, but it was me who left.  My boss brought up some good points that it would be difficult for things to be handled with all this change, and I agreed with him.  I regret every day that I did though, it was the first big fight that I walked away from.  I was just so emotional distraught and not thinking clearly I took it, I wish now I had taken some time and thought some more about it.  I am ashamed that I was a coward.  I am not mad at him or anyone else for my unemployment, I refuse to blame anyone or anything other than myself.  I was presented a problem, and a choice of solutions, I took the easy way out.  Only time will tell if I made the right decision. I hope this puts all the whispers and rumors to rest.  I apologize to all I inadvertently hurt, by either perceived inclusion in insults or my lack of inclusion in thanks.  I am posting allot and at a very high pace, sorry for any misunderstandings.  As for those of you with no intrest in this matter sorry for boring you.

       Quick post then interview time...  I am adding a new link in the area of people I admire today, my little brother.  He is the one who gave me the courage to be myself, and for that I cannot repay him.  I am posting his new blogspot, pigmy-tribe, it is the name of a group of friends he used to jam with in college.  His music taste and mine share some common things, but not much, he is more folky.  I was never able to get into Ani Defranco, I was more a 10,000 maniacs and Sarah Mclauchland(bad spell) kind of person for female angst. Not to mention Annie Lennox, Mellisa, and Anlanis Morrisett. He grew up with that whole folk movement, while my teen years were spent with the Ramones, the Dead Kennedys, the sex pistols and the like.  My only liking of folk comes from the standard issue Dylan you must listen to and like in white suburban america.  Oh and lest we forget, that Springsteins good stuff, not the overly commercial stuff, has its kind of folkiness to it.  I have enjoyed just about every type of music over the years, and still do. How many people do you know with Sinatra, Tool, Limp biskit and abba in the same music collection? Now I have finally embraced country, if you listen to the words their stories are so real, so much like real life, instead of the pretend ones pop stars sing about.  Oh well, I am adding his site, but be patient it still is a work in progress.  And to all my fellow ex punk rockers...Gaba gaba hey.

        It's a great day to be alive...The sun still shines when I close my eyes...  Ok another day another opportunity.  I don't know what is my deal, but the creative juices just won't stop.  For me its part of the healing process, I write to heal, sometimes I get something good, sometimes not, such is life.  I wrote a total of four new poems since signing off last night.  One I wrote while watching  "kingdom hospital", a shorter one watching the history channel shortly thereafter,    yes I'm a  TV geek.   I also wrote one in the middle of the night, after I woke up and sat there staring at the ceiling at 2am, and had tears come to my eyes, after thinking about my conversations with my spouse that evening.  She is afraid to have me over, to an apartment I helped her move a good amount of shit into, and at one time long ago actually lived in with her.  She hasn't told her brother yet, who lives in the upstairs apartment about me, and is afraid of or for me coming over.  I haven't figured out which yet.  I am getting tired of everyone making decisions to   protect me.   Anyway it was a good poem about unconditional love and friendship.  The last one I wrote in the shower earlier this morning as I looked at what I have now and thought to a day sometime next spring when a surgery will fix it.  Enjoy, my musings at poetry.  This first one is about electrology visits and how pain isn't always a bad thing, if you are doing it towards a good goal, and you make the most of it.   Electrol Therapy   Synaspes firing  probe, beep, zap. Folicles frying, probe, beep, zap. Pores, red and swollen, probe, beep, zap. Hair slowly going, probe, beep, zap. In the warmth of the lamp, probe, beep, zap. I'm out in sun, laying on my back. probe, beep, zap. Erasing the scars of my maleness, probe, beep, zap. They say this is failless, probe, beep, zap. Just block out the pain, probe, beep, zap. Like soothing cool rain, probe, beep, zap. The pain doesn't hurt like it should, probe, beep, zap. When the conversation is good. probe, beep, zap. Time can fly even when it's not fun, probe, beep, zap. As long as you feel the warm lamp like the sun, probe, beep, zap. Through pain some good can come, probe, beep, zap. Yes it hurts, but I'll be sad when she's done, probe, beep, zap. Someday soon my treatment will end, probe, beep, zap. I will be sad, we talked liked old friends, probe, beep, zap.   Ok this next one is just about disconnecting to a place where the pain doesn't follow.   Happy place   I'm here but I'm not,  Its hard to explain. But you have to trick the mind, to win at it's game.  The juice flows from the wire, it sets my face ablaze. But alas I am not there. Body disconnected... Soul floating... Sunny beach... Summer day... Soft breezes... White sand... I do not feel the ground in my hand. I try not to feel the pain. I try not to focus on it. Instead I feel, Sun beating down... Wind in my hair... Talk about life... Both good and despair... But eventually, unfournately, I always get pulled back, by the only thing constant. The old,  probe, beep, zap.   Ok allot of people won't understand those, unless you've lived it.  This next one though we should all get, it is about the unconditional love and friendship we have in our animal friends.    Purrfect Friend   My feline friend jumps up on my lap. She arches her back, kneads my legs, and lifts her chin  as for me to pet. She purrs with approval, & to show her appreciation. She settles down, on the warm comfort of my lap. As I pet her head  and she drifts into sleep.  I lay on bed, unable to sleep. Looking back at the position of my life, I start to softly cry. My feline friend comes up from the foot of the bed, hops up on my chest, slowly kneading purring, as if petting me back. She rubs her face upon mine, as if to dry my tears. She comforts me now, as I did earlier to she. Her love she displays, with her knead and her purr.  She doesn't care about the length of my hair. She doesn't judge me for my clothes. She's never told me I am wrong. She just wants to be loved, and give it back to me. What better friend in life can you get? Her love, unconditional... Her attitude, sympathetic... It's sad and comforting at the same time, for as smart as we pretend to be, we fail to understand love like they do. Maybe that's why we have them for such a short time. We are undeserving... Most don't even realize they don't understand.  She needed a home. I needed a friend. Somehow it was meant to be. I just hope she can fathom, How she has kept me sane. I wish I could pay her back. But for now, with her cry, I let her hop up on my lap, and show her how I care.  To purr is to love... To err is human... Love is not judging... Love doesn't have to understand... Love just have to accept, what it is to be needed, and not be ashamed to need.   Ok so am I now destined to be the little old lady with 50 cats? No!  Ok last one, this one I came up with while in the shower.  I will have to go get some of those bath crayons, so I won't soak the floor again.   Surgery   As I look upon my naked body, And all it's imperfections. I prepare... To be whole.. To be fixed.. To be me.. To be done.  Done chasing rainbows. Done wishing for correction.. Start to live my life, Fully, Freely,  Complete.  The scalpel heals as it cuts, But it cannot fix all, Only make body match the mind. But once body and mind match, World LOOK OUT. For I will be fixed. I will continue to succeed, With even greater success. For if the mind isn't bogged down, with thoughts like What if? It can better concentrate on, Ok, What's next?    Hope you all enjoyed them today, I am all out right now, I need to reset, reflect, and prepare for the next hurdle. Take care, and be well.

       A big decision...  I have been checking surgeons for some time, weighing all the pluses and minuses of each and everyone.   I took in to consideration experience, results, type of procedure, level of care, travel costs, and of course costs both published and hidden.  I had it down to three, one didn't even get back to me so they went off fast.  I got it down to two, Dr. Bowers out in Colorado, and Dr. Reed in Miami.  They both seem to be great doctors, both highly qualified and both caring personalities.  It would be cheaper slightly to use Dr. Reed, but life isn't always about price.  Dr. Bowers has two real pluses, she puts you into a hospital instead of just a hospice type hotel, and she is not only a Dr. but a patient.  She had the surgery herself, and from her experiences has a little different take on things.  I contacted her today about scheduling surgery for next year.  I will wait to get back in the employment field and then send in my application for surgery.  I originally wanted to do it on my 35th b-day Jan 11, but I don't feel comfy with that date, it doesn't leave any room for error, and I don't want to set myself up for disappointment.  I have picked three dates, all with some significance.  My first choice is Feb 22, or 2/22, fitting since it is a bit of a second bday for me, and since my first one is 1/11 it is a fit.  My second choice is April 12,or 4/12 the numbers are for some reason good to me, plus I can give Co one last present on the sixth her b-day.  My third choice is may 10, or 5/10 the height I have listed on my license, but not my height any longer, I swear I have shrunk.  I measure a good 2 inches shorter now.  I lost a lot of muscle mass, especially in the shoulders, so this could explain things, I am going to have to ask next time I go to the endrocronologist.  Oh well off to bed, big interview tomorrow, it will be nice when I find that job that fits, glad I haven't rushed into anything just to have a job, but I have to pay for the surgery, so its time.  I already have decided its 2nd job time, we will get there, no matter how, no matter what.  Failure is not an option.  "Thank you God for giving me the strength to get this far, now help me get to the next round."

        Another Chuckle...  Just got back from a two hour treatment to find a cute litte note from my friend Co.  She always has a way to make me smile.   Bitchology    When I stand up for myself and my beliefs,  they call me a bitch.   When I stand up for those I love,  they call me a bitch.   When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts or do  things my own way, they call me a bitch.   Being a bitch means I won't compromise what's in  my heart. It means I live my life MY way. It  means I won't allow anyone to step on me.   When I refuse to tolerate injustice and  speak against it, I am defined as a bitch.   The same thing happens when I take time for  myself instead of being everyone's maid.   It means I have the courage and strength to  allow myself to be who I truly am and won't  become anyone else's idea of what  they think I "should" be.   I am outspoken, opinionated and determined.  I want what I want and there is  nothing wrong with that!   So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame,  try to squash every ounce of beauty I hold  within me. You won't succeed. And if  that makes me a bitch, so be it.   I embrace the title and am proud to bear it !!!!   B = Babe  I = In  T = Total  C = Control of  H = Herself     B = Beautiful  I = Intelligent  T = Talented  C = Charming  H = Hell  of a Woman     B = Beautiful  I = Individual  T = That  C = Can  H = Handle anything

        A nasty little poem...  Even though I am in a particularly good mood today, I did finish work on this latest poem.  It is a nasty one about  the hypocrisy I am finding in the church in dealing with me.  I am already not going to Catholic heaven for becoming a Lutheran, now I have excluded from their heaven too.  I find it amazing how a religion based on forgiveness and love, can be so intolerant.  Sorry if I offend anyone for taking cheap shots at the church, as you may have seen in my earlier stuff I do believe very much in God, I just am saddened at mankind screwing up with hypocritical religious practices.  Take care and thanks for reading.    hypocrisy   Some times it amazes me, this world filled with hypocrisy. They say: Do as I say, not as I do. I do what I want, and ask more of you.  Love thy neighbor, be tolerant and kind. I'd love to help you out, but I don't approve of your kind.  Go get help elsewhere, far away if you must. We only like our own kind around, it keeps us riteous and just.  See that man on the cross, he died for MY sins. Not for YOUR KIND, your friends, nor your kin.  Yes Jesus taught love, no he didn't teach hate. But I KNOW he doesn't approve, of the choices you make.  And how could God have made a mistake. You see it's not like it for him to do. I sure YOU"RE mistaken, and you should just stay you.  You say its no choice, you say that you must. I won't stand for this tone, I don't approve of you fuss.  I know what's best for you, you can take it from me. Now go be a man,  no longer bother me.  If you become a woman, we won't take you back. You'll go burn in hell,  in the fire, pain and black.  God loves us all, that is except for you. Now be off heathen,  go do what you do.  I have to go counsel, old Father O'Shea. He just got caught in a nasty position, just the other day.  HE can be saved, even though he was bad. He couldn't help it,  it was the lust that he had.  Yeah, we'll pay off the boy, because he'll probably grow to be screwed up. But hey thats ok, because I hold salvation's cup.  YOU won't get into heaven , if you don't listen to me. Unless you wish to pay, Salvation isn't free.  So come pad my coffers, Lets get your salvation plans made. Buy your ticket to heaven, So some ex-altar boys can be paid.

       A contribution from a friend  This poem came to me from a new friend from Austraila, glad to see it is truly a global village.  Fairy Dust.   Fairy dust, and magic wand Change me in an instant from the hung up secret closet-dweller who carries pretty thoughts within.  Change me to the happy soul i know i am and always were. Take away the pain of feeling distant.  Fairy dust and magic wand Give me friends whom i can know. Joyous ways in which to grow, Seeds of honesty to sow. Strip away i pray, the phoney shell and take away the pain of this `dysphoria'.    Brianna. 1996.

       Life's too short....  Don't know what did it, but what difference a day makes.  Gone are my funk and despair, I am once again clear headed and not going full clip in every direction anymore.  I feel bad for some of my actions lately, but I cannot apologize for being human.  We all at one time or another get so excited about new things, and new tastes that we can go nuts.  If I alienated anyone these last few weeks, I apologize, I hope we can get things back to normal.  To my new friends, sorry if I came across too strong, not my normal MO, but I hope I didn't scare you off.  I am a very sane, and usually reserved person.    The coolest thing has happened since I went to my first support group last Saturday, I have started seeing myself as Ashley in my dreams all the time.  Before that I was mostly my old male role in my dreams, with the occasional female form as a treat.  But now, its all Ashley all the time.  I don't know if going to a function with a group of my peers was the catalyst for this nice development, or what, but I do enjoy it.  Before when I did dream that I was Ashley, it was as a genetic woman, there had been no mistake at birth, total fantasy.  I have been dreaming now about be Ashley as I am in reality, and last night I had a dream that I was post op.  Gone were the disillusion that I was never like this, and that time some how went back and fixed it all.  Now I am happy with my present form, and looking forward to that next big metamorphis thru surgery. In the dream I was dealing with some issue(I think it was a big project at my job, not sure what I was doing, but had a deadline to beat) it was nice to see myself after surgery, and healthy that I saw myself dealing with a problem.  Surgery won't fix everything, but it will go towards fixing a good amount of problems.  I also think that I have finally realized that I am fine with the fact that I am a transsexual, in a way it is a bit of a privledge.  I love being a woman, I am not complete yet, but in essence I am treated like a woman by the outside world.  Unfortunately in the world we live in there remains to this day different sets of standards for men and women, some I enjoy, some I don't.  It will take me time to get used to all the different stuff associated with being a woman.  The part where I feel privledged comes from my life as a man, I did many things I could not have accomplished if I had been born female. More doors of opportunity were open to me by an old school sexist few, and thanks to them I can go and be female.   I am not trying to demean women in any way shape or form, I have been on both sides of the gender fence and I have a little extra insight.  I will miss some of the stuff I used to get away with in my male form, but I have a whole new bag of stuff at my disposal now.  I look forward to experiencing more new things as Ashley, while I use the skills I learned from my past time of privledge.  I am finding it cool to be a multiple threat in both business and personal stuff, I am told I look good, so I try to look nice, but I also use my wit when I can, beauty is fleeting.  I also keep trying to learn new stuff, you have to stay up on things and not rest on your past, this drive I got from being a man who wanted to be a woman.  On the homefront I do lots of things good associated with both sexes, I can cook, I can work on a car, I can knit, I can watch and discuss sports.  I can make you something pretty and artsy, or I can catch, clean and cook a fish for you.  I get the best of both worlds from being this way, the only bad part is the pain that it takes to make this journey.

       ok that came quicker than I thought  I had been working on something on how it feels to have old "friends" and co workers turn weird on you, because they are uncomfortable with the whole situation.  I have used some of the actual terms that some of my friend/ex-co-workers have used to describe me, and how I feel lately.  I am lucky to have a few friends who are sticking by me still, thanks,  margaret,k,d,j,co&johnny g you know I appreciate it greatly.  Oh and Tubby thanks for the title you ignorant little prick.   Freak Show   Get out now, go away, You no longer belong. You best don't come back, You've been here to long.  You used to cool, Just one of the guys. Before you grew breasts, And painted your eyes.  Yeah you stood by me, In good times and bad. But that's when you liked, The equipment you had.  You've really upset us, By not fitting in. Now you're a freakshow, Just living for sin.  We don't care if you're happy, since it makes us upset. We can't be comfortable with you, instead we'd prefer to forget.  Forget how you freaked us out, forget you confessed. Forget the picture in our mind, of a man in a dress.  We will just move on without you, and sweep you under the rug. Even though we parted, with a smile, handshake and hug.  Good luck in your endeavors, keep in touch? Oh don't bother. You should have done this before, you became a husband and father.  Our own faults we forget, while yours we'll embellish. For the fact that your gone, Is the only thought we will relish.  Go freakshow now, go be with your own kind. Go get out of my sight, So you'll be out of my mind.  There's no turning back, there'll be no second look. By the way I hope you'll be nice, about me in your book.

       ...You just roll with it baby....  The hits keep coming, upset my brother deeply for not helping he, his boyfriend and their roommate move yesterday.  I don't blame him for being mad, I just haven't been myself lately.  I wouldn't have been all that much help though, I have lost so much muscle mass.  I think we are cool again, we both agreed to keep the lines of communication open more.  I just wish he would have just pushed a little more in asking, he just asked once a few days ago, and then didn't push.  I was so taken by surprise that he was moving, since his plans earlier in the week were to not be going.  I get so confused lately.  I feel bad that I have been so to myself lately, but I am just reacting to my situation.  A good amount of people from my old life are now gone, and it hurts.  I am meeting some new people along the way, and it is cool, just finding my way.  I think I am doing something Dr. Sterner from the clinic warned me about earlier in counseling.  She warned me to be careful because sometimes you get a little taste of something, and you can over do it.  Its a classic thing with us trans people. We just sometimes go nuts like a kid in a candy store wanting to experience everything now.  I apologize to any of my old or new friends that I have freaked out in doing this.  I have found it does some good though.  I had told myself I was never going to be an activist, it just wasn't me, but in just doing little things for myself I am also finding myself doing stuff "for the community".  I am technically a registered republican, No comments please, and I went in search of a gay republican group.  I found the L.R.C, the log cabin republicans, and their motto is victory through inclusion.  There is only one problem, I saw nowhere on their site they include transpeople so I wrote a nasty little email.  I know its not a whole lot, or a really big deal but it was a first step for me.  I think I am going to rethink the whole not being an activist thing.  Oh and by the way, I am going down to the town clerk to register as an independent on Thursday.

        Oh well another day closer to that big goal!    Applied for a whole bunch of jobs this morning.  Luckily  I noticed a big typo on the bottom of my cover letter.  According to my letter I was   looking forward to the pleasure  of  being under you employment.    I am not the kind of girl who would want the  employment   of being under some one, what would I do for fun when I wasn't working? And to honest, I think a newbie like me, would starve on what I would make doing that.  This  typo could explain the spotty response I have gotten.  Those who have gotten back to me are impressed with my resume, they must have missed the typo too.  Electrolysis tomorrow, had to turn down an interview to go.  They said they were willing to change the interview for me, and understood since they called the day before.  I can't keep changing my electrolysis appointments like I have been,  you don't want to piss of the gal that controls the juice . But I also need a job,decided today if I cannot find work by months end I will have to stop, for now, going to my favorite person to ever delivery an electric shock to my dermis.

      Its been one of those days. Lost power long enough to lose my first attempt at this post. I am also still mourning a big part of my old life, that will not be there in my new the same way.  I know my spouse and I will still be friends, but it is not the same as before.  It's ok I guess, I should look at the bright side, this gives me time to figure out who I am and what is next.  I still have a whole lot to figure out, including which team I am on sexually, if any.  I still find some women attractive, yet some men just, I don't know....Also went down to the rental office to pay my rent just as I do every month, sighed in relief when "bob" who is the one that I always paid the rent to did not recognize me from my old role.  I live in a big complex, and while I did change my name with his boss, they are so busy they have already forgotten about the trans renter.  He just has this puzzled, "I don't remember her" look to him, another small silly victory. Any way, I have still been looking through old stuff I wrote, and I just had to share this one from 1990.  It's spooky how I predicted my life would turn out is how it is right now.  I have gained allot, but also given allot up to get here that I held dear.  I just hope that there is another place that I did not see then, or now, in which the victory quells the pain.  Me   My body and soul are not as one, for one is of dark,  the other of sun. I feel far away, as if I don't fit in. But for me to be one, I'm told is a sin. I battle real hard to gain control, but as I scratch and I claw, I just fall deeper in the hole. My soul belongs to not only me, but primarily to God. And I know that through HELL I must trod. But for me do not mourn. For one day I shall emerge, victorious and battle torn. And I really shall neither lost nor won. But my body and soul shall be as one. A HURTFUL VICTORY FOR THE GREAT DISGUISER, NONE THE BETTER, BUT HOPEFULLY WISER.   Sorry and yes I am a recovering Catholic.  This second one is one I just wrote last year, and thought was worth sharing.  After reading in the act of posting it I healed just a little bit.  I hope others enjoy it, this one was tough to write, but I am glad I did.   The Last   If we spend too much time wondering if this will be the last, we are destined to bogged down in times that are past. Instead of asking if "that was the last one?' We should be looking forward in anticipation to the next one. Last kisses, last dances, last hugs breaths and embraces, these are things that to all mortals are certain. But we don't spend all play focused on the final curtain. When God calls us home we all have to go, but when that time is, only God only knows.  From the time we are born. Till the time that we die.... In eternity's time is a blink of an eye. What we do to fill our blink is up to us. We can fill it with love and joy, or we can fill it with anger and fuss. We need to be able to enjoy what is here and now, to be able to look to the future to plan, and ask how. How to get what and where we want to get, to live for the future, but the past not forget. Our lasts will come, on that there can be no doubt.   But you know it could be much worse. For as much as lasts cut to the bone, as much as lasts hurt. Imagine how empty you would feel, if we never had a first.    Sad but right now that is the best piece I can find from the last year.  My mothers common law husband is dying of cancer, I think I need to print this one out and share it with her for comfort.

      Had another scam of an interview this morning.  Are people that desperate for employees that they have to lie to you about certain aspects of the job.  I asked the same gentleman that interviewed me today less than five days ago if the leads they provided were recycled, his story changed in this short time.  I had thought it was a good opportunity, but it wasn't.   While waiting in his office though I came across a great little piece on character.  Sometimes it is hard to remember that we still need to be and still are our true selves no matter where we are on the road of transition.   The Essence of Character   Your true character is revealed by the clarity of your convictions, the choices you make, and the promises you keep.  Hold strongly to your principles and refuse to follow the currents of convience.  What you say & do defines who you are. And who you are YOU ARE FOREVER  Thank you Ms. or Mr. Inspirational office picture author !

      Trying to find a good poem to take me out of my funk, all I keep finding are dark works.  I did find this one in which a do believe I was paying homage to that certain Dr. Suess style I grew up with.  Forgive some of the parts for being flaky, emotions of the moment sometimes cloud my literary judgment in choosing my words.  I hope I can find something good to post soon.  I am also working on a book, but my emotions are too raw to continue right now, so this is what I am doing for therapy.  Thanks for hanging round my soap-box, enjoy this work from about this time last year.  Sorry   I hope all is well,  I'm sorry for putting you through hell. I know you can see, How this is killing me. But yet I still have to do this as well.  I know that this is tough on you,  What are you supposed to do? Do you go, or do you stay?, Even though you're not gay, You still have feelings for me anyway.  Please I hope you can understand, This problem is out of my hands. If I could change things I would,  But I fear it'd do no good, God would just throw something else our way.  This problem's not one easily fixed. For years it has made me quite sick. For us I am sure,  That short of a cure, Somehow, somewhere, someone will make good. Good on the good times that we'll miss. Good on all the nights with no kiss. I do not know how, Not then, Before, Or now. They can truly make up for times that were missed.  But PLEASE don't be confused by the sad. And PLEASE don't waste you time being mad. You're not to blame, For me changing my name, And the restroom that I use in my life.  I'm sorry that this didn't work, I feel like a big total jerk. I hope we're not through, That there's more me and you, Times to be had yet in this life.  Sometimes life likes to kick you in the beans, Yes it can be down right mean. If you have beans or not, When you get that big shot, You hold what you got, And breathe when you can between screams.  I think that I've stopped making sense, I've started to write some nonsense. Please know that it's true, That I'm thinking of you, In future and not just past tense.  Please try as you can to be strong. Promise me you will keep going on. Don't settle for fail, And I know you'll prevail. And have a good story to pass on.  I wish it didn't have to be you, I wish I knew exactly what to do, To not make you feel,  Like life's dirty heel. All covered with all my crap. Love, me I can't change the past, Nor can I promise you the future. I can only hope that you'll forgive me for my past enough to talk to me in the future.   Sorry for the corniness folks it isn't my best work, but I hit a few good thoughts, in spurts, in it.

      Whoa that was not a good nites sleep.    Getting back to my story, I told you a little bit about me yesterday.  I am also still married to the most wonderful woman in the world, unfortunately we are living separate and not as a couple any longer.  I am have seen a good amount of coverage lately where the couple will stay together even after one of the partners begins this journey.  While it does happen, just like someone wins the powerball now and then, most end up in a bad ending.  I am going through an in between kind of parting.  She and I are still soulmates and best friends, we both wish to be in each other's life, but as friends, not as a couple or as lovers.  It does kind of suck, but it is part of the price one pays, at least we have something out of the relationship.  We already have two great children who will always stand as a testament of our love.  Now we are working on taking our love for each other, and to have it grow into a really beautiful friendship.  This is hard on both of us, I have changed so much, and that has been tough on her, I feel I am the same person inside, so her not being into me anymore hurts.  We will get through this like all things.  We have come this far, and we have already lasted more than most do.  I had been asking my wife what our future was after seeing how hurt someone was who thought they had a good relationship and didn't.  I at least know where we stand right now, and like I said it will take time to heal for both of us.  She is hurt by her decision too, I feel for her having to tell someone she has been in love with for so long that it is over in the old way.  Spent a good amount of crying time last night, but also found an old poem I want to share from my old days as a gender confused and depressed twenty year old.  Don't worry, it is dark, but I am a different person now than I was back in 1990, and I value life too much to go and do something like kill myself.    Out of Control   It feels as if I'm not in control. As if someone is trying  To damm my soul. As I travel along at full clipp, On my runaway course, As if over a cliff. I fight like mad to gain control, Over my mind, my heart, my body, my soul. But as farther into maddness and depression I go, It becomes more apparent, That I'm not in control. I can't stop this one way trip, HELP ME GOD GET OFF THIS SHIP ! I need you now, As I need me, To regain control, And set me free.

       Hmm ok now I get it...  I used to tease Co allot because she used to love to clean like crazy when she got down.  It was like she was on a mission to get everything cleaned, and it usually got her out of her funk.  I remembered this while scrubbing the reflectors on my stove a while ago.  I guess I must be more blue then I thought.  Cleaning does feel good, I do feel my mood improving slightly, sorry I teased her so bad about it.   Don't know why it is hurting to grow, but for some reason it is.  Maybe not being able to go back to a career field that I loved and enjoy it, has waken more of those, you can never go home again feelings.  I miss some old friends, I miss my family, I am enjoying my new life, and my new friends too.  It is yet another crossroads, not as big as deciding to do this or to go off the bridge, but important still the same.  But crossroads are good to have, with crossroads you have options, which equal exciting opportunities that most folks don't even have.  I'll keep my crossroads, keep reflecting on where I've been and finding my way by turning cautiously, and enjoying the ride.   Gonna go work out some blues on the cat box.

       Good riddance, bad mood...  Ok not in a good fucking mood.  Feel dirty after leaving my job.  Sent out email saying goodbye and explaining why I left, got not one response.  Oh well, live and learn.  I just don't want to think about the pet industry any more, or old lives already lived out.  Went out last night after school, the company was great, but the bar was not.  It was this poorly done attempt at an Irish pub.  The entertainment sucked, how do you ruin "margarritavile" and "high friends in low places" in the same set?  It felt ok to go out, but I felt bad since my mind was elsewhere.  I may or may not have to skate this one off.  I guess this is what I get for treating my career as too big a part of my life, when things change, which they always do, it hurts allot more then it should.  Sorry for the blog-explosion yesterday afternoon, just getting off energy.  I think I need to find other ways to do shit.  I love it, it just is tough sometimes to keep my emotions so raw.  I enjoy writing, and I assure you everything you read here is unfortunately both real and how I feel.  Not only do I not hide who I am, but how I feel.  Tough being naked all the time, being an emotional exhibitionist.  Gotta go. Love to all, take care...

       One last thing...  I got a letter today from the state about child support since we have enrolled the kids in a few programs.  They called looking for Scott,and I just explained how it was to this really nice lady. She understood, and since I am paying child support and everything is cool, she wished me luck, said how sorry she was for me and my situation and went onto the next case.  Glad there are some compassionate people to be found.  I'm going to go do something nice today to a stranger for no particular reason other than to spread some good will, and pay back the universe.

       Wow, weird thoughts...  As I was pulling into my parking lot I got this odd thought.  I was blue about stuff that happened today, and thought hey at least I have some free time today to crossdress and cheer myself up.    Ok, well hun, you are already doing that full time, what are you gonna do dress as a man?   I don't know why I got lost in my thoughts so much I forgot.  The same thing happened to me the other day as I was leaving for work.  As I am backing out and leaning back glancing over my shoulder, I got a feeling of panic when I realized I didn't have my wallet in my back left pocket.  It took me a second to remember its in my purse.  I love these silly moments and hope shit like this will cheer me up when I am down and blue over life's troubles.

       Ok I really hate goodbyes...  Went in and had a long talk with my boss today, and even shed a tear or twenty.  I informed him today that I had a better opportunity and was leaving after only a month under his employ.  He said he was dissapointed, and thought we should have given it more time, but said he understood.  I felt so bad, he believed in my ability to work in my old field as a woman and took me in when nobody else did.  From his understanding I was able to go out and prove two things, that I could go see all kinds of people and not be afraid to show who I am, and that 99% of them didn't care.  I still have some issues with the company I left before going to work for my last job, but I think I did prove my point to them.  It is so comforting to know that my customers were even more accepting of me then I ever imagined, the only ones who had problems with it were my fellow sales folks.  They got a little nasty when they saw that I was still out closing deals being this "freak" when they couldn't get in the door.  Well if they just had some integrity and a good reputation they would be closing deals.  This is very hard for me to do, I have done nothing else my adult life but deal with pets or foods in some way. I will miss it greatly, but when opportunities or providence knocks you gotta listen.  I did want to share some lyrics from one of my favorite songs, I wasn't going to post the whole thing, and save it for another day, but I had to do the whole thing.  I'm Movin On Rascal Flats    I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons finally content with a past I regret.  I've found you've found strength in your moments of weakness, for once I'm at peace with myself. I've been burdened with blame trapped in the past for too long I'm movin' on.  I've lived in this place and I know all the faces each one is different but there always the same. they mean me no harm but its time that I face it; they'll never allow me to change.  But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong I'm movin' on.  I'm movin' on, at last I can see (at last I can see) life has been patiently waiting for me and I know there's no guarantees.  but I'm not alone.  There comes a time, in everyone's life when all you can see  are the years passing by and I have made up my mind that those days are gone.  I've sold what I could and packed what i couldn't,  Stopped to fill up on my way out of town I've love like I should but lived like I shouldn't; I had to loose everything to find out; Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road;  I'm movin on. I'm movin on I'm movin on.        Oh yeah the new job..  I am the new admission's officer for the Atlantic bartending School in lovely Waterbury, ok if some predator show up I may be a girl but I can still bring it on, so watch out.  It will be nice to be doing something different and not killing myself on the road, I need some time off the road.  I don't know if it will be a career type post or not yet, but if you don't try, you don't know.  I love the people I will be working with, and it kind of follows my wanting to help folks, I will just be helping folks by getting them some training to help them from near self destruction of being poorly trained and poorly paid.  I will let you all know how it goes, it won't be easy work, but as long as the keep sending me leads, and I am doing well at it, I will stick by this one, it just seems a fit.  It was wierd when I went to my first day of class and was asked if I was happy at my job, and if I was still interested in working for them ( I had turned down an offer to work for them in March to go work for my last employer, remember about the story about the short skirt, the snow and the gay guy who didn't care about my beautiful legs)  That is not just a sign, its a hit you up side you stupid head kind of sign.  I couldn't have had this one spelled out for me any clearer, this is my path for some reason, and I am choosing to follow a path for a change, instead of blazing my own fucking trail.  Its allot easier to get poison ivy on your own path then on one provided you by divine intervention.  Oh well I am back to being unemployed until the tenth, maybe  I might finnish my blanket, and try to get some color into my pastey white skin. Love to all, take care.

       Piling it on...  Ok as if I am not trying to tackle enough shit, I decided to reach out an olive branch to one of the few people who were close as family to me, and does not accept this.  We got into a pretty hot and heavy exchange via email, she criticized me for exposing my kids to this, I her for exposing her kid to a drunk of a dad with infidelity issues, and that was the nice shit.  I wrote her a nice email offering to meet somewhere and just talk.  I told her this wasn't my choice, but the other life had failed so bad I have to do this.  I don't know if she will take me up on my offer or not.  I wasn't going to write her, in fact I had written her off, but I am not the type to let go of somebody I love like family.  I friend or associate, ok, get another one, but when they are like family you keep trying until all avenues have failed(like with my sister).  If she doesn't want to talk, I'll try again in October on her B-day, if that doesn't work maybe a Christmas card.  I will go until she just tells me to go fuck myself and stop bothering her.  I have learned how to pester so well from being in sales, and how to just try again once you hit a wall and keep looking for something, anything to get through.  I really hope she comes around, she took me in when stuff went bad with me and my dad, and before I moved in with her fully I spent some nights sleeping in my car or in a tent off in the woods. I've come a long way baby.  I just wish I could get more folks to come along with me. Love to all, gotta go have that talk with a certain someone.  If he flips out and does something stupid, like use his martial arts on me...  thanks for everything, peace to all, may the joy of love keep you sane in an insane world.    Hey you never know......

       Not expecting much sleep...  Ok, ok I promise tomorrow I will fill you all in,but I am so freaked out over a conversation I have to have with a man I like and kinda respect still.  I have told a few of my closer friends, but I am 90% sure he checks out this site.  I just have to remember in the words of my ex boss " it is what it is".  In other words I need to remember to just accept things as they are and not add or subtract from them.  Friends are friends, business is business, and family is forever, even if you sister is a little fucking bitch from hell that needs to have the snobb ass shit knocked out of her for shutting out her Glbt siblings, and maybe walk a mile in our shoes.(sorry major vent)  My brother and I have a suspicion that she is a lesbian who can't handle the truth.  There is something genetically in my family that just makes us this way, why should she have been spared?  I won't go into it here, I do have some compassion left for her, not to discuss shit she told me in confidence in better days.  School is cool and I have made really good friends with two people there who are most likely reading this.  It is just very cool to be treated like a human being instead of a freak show, to be able to talk about fetishes, and joke about leather, and gay issues or being bi without being looked at like a total freak.  I have a habit of freaking folks out by them just knowing my past, never mind having real adult conversations.  If I tried to have half the conversations we have the last few nights, or told the jokes we told to one of my friends that have stuck by me, they would be added to the list of ex-friends.  Oh well I better get going, I have to go prepare a speech, and get ready to take on a new day,which is already here since I am long winded in my typing. Love to all, may happiness brighten your heart tomorrow, and wisdom lighten your load.

       Tear jerker...  Co sent me this great story she got sent to her, and I just had to share.  I wasn't going to blog this am, but I am having a little trouble getting up for another day at my present job, soon, very soon, things will be better because I chose to do something about it instead of being depressed about it.  This story hit home hard today as I have had to make some tough choices and I just got done with an email trying to help a young tranny who is having trouble with stuff.  I am not giving the rah, rah, life as a tranny is great speech.  We are not Jehova's witnesses looking to save some souls, we are trying to make it with a not so great hand in life.  I have been explaining the need for strength, how she will loose allot, and it will get harder before it gets better.  I hope she listens, she as the same age as I was when I tried to transition about 15 years ago, not an easy task.  Oh well the story, hope it touches you too.  Michael is the kind of guy you love to hate. He is always in a good mood  and always has something positive to say.   When someone would ask him how he was doing, would reply, "If I were any  better, I would be twins!"   He was a natural motivator.   If an employee was having a bad day, Michael was there telling the employee  how to look on the positive side of the situation.   Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to Michael  and asked him, "I don't get it! You can't be a positive person all of the  time. How do you do it?"   Michael replied, "Each morning I wake up and say to myself, you have two  choices today.   You can choose to be in a good mood or ... you can choose to be in a bad  mood.   I choose to be in a good mood.   Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or ... I can  choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it.   Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept their  complaining or... I can point out the positive side of life. Choose the  positive side of life.   "Yeah, right, it's not that easy," I protested. "Yes, it is," Michael said.   "Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk, every situation  is a choice. You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people  affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood.   The bottom line: It's your choice how you live your life."   I reflected on what Michael said. Soon thereafter, I left the Tower  Industry to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often thought about  him when I made a choice about life instead of reacting to it.   Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved in a serious  accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications tower.   After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Michael was released  from the hospital with rods placed in his back.   I saw Michael about six months after the accident. When I asked him how he  was, he replied. "If I were any better, I'd be twins. Wanna see my scars?"   I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what had gone through his  mind as the accident took place.   "The first thing that went through my mind was the well-being of my soon to  be born daughter," Michael replied. "Then, as I lay on the ground, I  remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live or ... I could  choose to die. I chose to live."   "Weren't you scared? Did you lose\ consciousness?" I asked.   Michael continued, "...the paramedics were great. They kept telling me I  was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the ER and I saw the  expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really scared. In  their eyes, I read "he's a dead man. I knew I needed to take action."   "What did you do?" I asked.   "Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me," said Michael.  "She asked if I was allergic to anything. "Yes, I replied." The doctors and  nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath  and yelled, "Gravity."   Over their laughter, I told them, "I am choosing to live. Operate on me as  if I am alive, not dead."   "Michael lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his  amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day we have the choice to  live fully.   Attitude, after all, is everything. "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow,  for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its  own." After all today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.      If you wish to fight the world, then choose to fight it strongly, and with dignity, and don't let it destroy you in the process. -Ashley

       To every thing, there is a season...  Hmmm the season is changing, not literally but figuratively.  I can't go into much right now, but I had to make a pretty important decision today that was more made for me, than by me.  I 'm sorry to tease, but I just had to let you know from my last post that I had completed a big decision making process.  Class is cool, we had this fucking Retaad(sorry Boston accent) who claims he is going to run against local congresswoman Nancy Johnson because he worked with Senator Lieberman on getting fuel cell funding.  This guy is a nut, I think he has a good idea of using them more to help cut down on the dependency on foreign oil, but he personally is a nut.  He finally passed his test tonight so it was his last night, and me being in a foul mood had to push his buttons.  I love the fact that I can be more of an asshole without getting smacked in the mouth because I am perceived as a woman.  So I asked him the big current event question on same sex marriage.  He opposes both Bush's doma amendment and gay marriage.  He thinks that gay people should be able to do there own stuff, but if gay civil servants got married then his taxpayer money would be funding same sex benefits, which to him is unacceptable.  Ok who the hell likes how their taxpayer money is spent?  There are lots of people who oppose the war whose money is going to fund that, there are gay people and single childless folks paying for schools their non existent children will never use.  This guy was just a fucking head case, and coming from this gal that's bad.  At least I can use him for my motivation for passing myself.  I most likely won't post in the am since I am on now, and I am sorry for not sharing what exactly I am talking about, but I am afraid someone who this decision affects may be reading this now, and deserves to have me tell him face to face.  How can I not be afraid to be an out tranny, but scared to have regular heart to heart discussions with some folks. Go figure. Love to all, hey keep T in your hearts,minds and prayers, send her some good energy and spirit, she should be recovering from surgery out west as we speak.  I can't wait to get there myself. Take care.

       Quick and short...  Last night was very cool.  School is very GLBT friendly, the director is gay and kinda cute, my instructor is a questioning lesbian and spunky cute.  It took a while to start remembering the drinks but by the end of the night I think I had it.  We will see tonight when I have to learn a new batch plus make some from last night.  The coolest thing was about this class I was the shortest female student there.  One of my classmates is an ex-college basketball player (div 2)who is an inch or two bigger than I, and the other one is just a tall thin gen gal who is about 6 foot tall.  I love blending in for a change, so often I think I get looked at due to my 5'9" frame.  I know I am better than allot of trans-gals but I still ain't no 5'3" average woman either.  The placement is second to none, and I already pretty much have several opportunities that they could get me in no problem.  One of them is the Polo club in Hartford, I've never been there but I heard its a little "different" shall we say, a little parytish.  Hey we will have to go check it out, maybe go with my bro.  On the job front, I have something cooking that I won't discuss here until I am sure.  Things are really not in a good place at work.  I would love to discuss more, but not yet,not tipping my hand quite yet.  Ok off to Massachusetts and then back to school this evening.  Love to all, take care.

       A sign of doing the right thing?...  Ok tired and a little overwhelmed on how I am not only going to make it through the next two weeks of class, but how I am going to handle working all day and then till the wee hours of the am a few nights a week also.  I wasn't going to check email today, but I just knew I had too.  Well after a few months I finally got a response from Dr. Bowers on some questions I had for her.  It doesn't take much to excite me, but this does greatly improve my tude, and will help in regaining that fire and focus I need.  I kinda let myself get screwed these past few months with income, bills and shit.  Instead of boo whoing about it, I have decided to just do something about it.  This is not going to be an easy time for me, but I have worked two jobs before in my life, I know I can do.  If I fail in my pursuit it won't be from lack of trying. I have had several people voice concerns over me working myself too hard.   I won't be tending bar every night, and as I told a friend who raised her concerns, "I can sleep during surgery."   If I am successful I am going to have one of the best vacations next spring.  I am looking so forward to going out to Trinidad or up to Montreal and coming home complete, sore as hell, but complete.  If this tending bar stuff doesn't work out, I won't give up, I will just go another second job.  I cannot fail in this, I have nothing to go back to.  I tried being a man for over 30 years and it was so wrong for me I came close to throwing my life away.  I will apologize in advance to anyone who feels me to be distant in these hard times ahead, don't take it personally.  You know me well enough by now that when I am pissed at you, I will tell you.  Enjoy the rain to all my local pals, hope it doesn't darken your spirits. Love to all,take care.

       Sometimes you wanna go, where everybody knows your name....  Ok just a little reminder I won't be posting much this week or next.  The next two weeks are bartender school.  I will be going from early in the am at my day job and school at night from 6 to 10, by the time I get home and get to bed after 11.  This won't be an easy two weeks,but I am not going to make this journey get any shorter by sitting my ass on the couch.  I love blogging and will miss it tremendously, even though knowing me I will find a moment or two to blog quick.  I am not going to make any money here, unless somebody in my audience can offer me a book or columnist deal, which I highly doubt.  Went to the beach today with Co and the kids, it was cool but way too short.  I think some of my blues are from how little time I am spending with them.  They are my family and I love them, but the way we were doing shit before was slowly driving both me and Co crazy.  We weren't allowing for any closure or moving on, now I feel left behind.  I will have to adjust, I feel that a good amount of my insomnia is caused by me feeling this way.  I can't say I will go to counseling for it, I just need to be able to work through it.  Life is hard and if we keep running to a counselor to help us handle stuff we loose our ability to handle the hard stuff on our own.  It will just take time, some tears, and discovering how to handle my new relationship with Co and the kids.   Speaking of new relationships, one of the girls at my support group asked where my partner was yesterday.  I asked her partner? She says "yeah Nicole". Nicole came last week to a function attended by some in my support group and was liked by everyone who met her.   I told her kindly she wasn't my partner but my to be ex spouse and my best friend.  She apologized but I laughed about it.  I would like nothing better for Co to be my partner again, but it is not meant to happen I guess.  Maybe my friend at support group still saw the love and compassion Co and I still have for each other, even though it is in a much different way.   I have been searching for feelings on what our relationship is. Lovers? No that ended awhile ago, I can't due to hormones, and I look too much like a chick to turn her on anymore. (wow, a little dirt finally) Friends?  I think we are much more than friends, we have a bond of family.  Sisters? Well this one is about as close at it can get, we share family interests, we share everything, turn to each other to laugh or cry, and we both hate our real sisters.  Both our sisters are real nasty Cunts.  Wow me using that word you must know they are bad.  Whatever Co and I are now I am grateful for her in my life, and for my spot in hers.  We compliment each other so well,we are yings to each other's yangs, and all the other metaphors.  We just weren't meant to stay together as husband and wife.  I wish it didn't have to be that way, but why should I get to pick how my life ends up when nobody else does either?    Well I better get going, making lunches for the week, organizing my meds, and working on lessons for school.  Take care to anyone who reads my blog, I will try to write when I can.  Love you all.

I can just imagine stoned college kids across the nation staying on the site for hours on end.  Enjoy it.  Off to twenty with Shelly.  Love to all, take care.

       Funny stuff...  Ok time for a much needed laugh.  Co sent me this test please take it to find out where you stand. I switch back and forth between methods 5 & 7 myself, and they are pretty much right in my personality, weird.  Psychologists have discovered that the manner in which people eat Oreo cookies provides great insight into their personalities. Choose which method best describes your favorite method of eating Oreos:   1. The whole thing all at once.  2. One bite at a time  3. Slow and methodical nibbles examining the results of each bite afterwards.  4. In little feverish nibbles.  5. Dunked in some liquid (milk, coffee...).  6. Twisted apart, the inside, then the cookie.  7. Twisted apart, the inside, and toss the cookie.  8. Just the cookie, not the inside.  9. I just like to lick them, not eat them.  10. I don't have a favorite way because I don't like Oreo.   Your Personality:   1. The whole thing.  This means you consume life with abandon, you are fun to be with,exciting, carefree with some hint of recklessness. You are totally irresponsible. No one should trust you with their children.   2. One bite at a time.  You are lucky to be one of the 5.4 billion other people who eat their Oreos this very same way. Just like them, you lack imagination, but that's okay, not to worry, you're normal.   3. Slow and Methodical.  You follow the rules. You're very tidy and orderly. You're very meticulous in every detail with every thing you do to the point of being anal retentive and irritating to others. Stay out of the fast lane if you're only going to go the speed limit.   4. Feverish Nibbles.  Your boss likes you because you get your work done quickly. You always have a million things to do and never enough time to do them. Mental breakdowns and suicides run in your family. Valium and Ritalin would do you good.   5. Dunked.  Every one likes you because you are always up beat. You like to sugar coat unpleasant experiences and rationalize bad situations into good ones. You are in total denial about the shambles you call a life. You have a propensity towards narcotic addiction.   6. Twisted apart, the inside, and then the cookie.  You have a highly curious nature. You take pleasure in breaking things apart to find out how they work, though not always able to put them back together, so you destroy all the evidence of your activities. You deny your involvement when things go wrong. You are a compulsive liar and exhibit deviant, if not criminal, behavior.   7. Twisted apart, the inside, and then toss the cookie.  You are good at business and take risk that pay off. You take what you want and throw the rest away. You are greedy, selfish, mean,and lack feelings for others. You should be ashamed of yourself. But that's ok, you don't care, you got yours.   8. Just the cookie, not the inside.  You enjoy pain.   9. I just like to lick them, not eat them  Stay away from small furry animals and seek professional medical help - immediately.   10. I don't have a favorite way, I don't like Oreo cookies.  You probably come from a rich family, and like to wear nice things,and go to up-scale restaurants. You are particular and fussy about the things you buy, own, and wear. Things have to be just right. You like to be pampered. You are a prima donna. There's just no pleasing you.

       Memories and milestones...  Really blue day today.  I still feel affected from last nights feelings.  I went through most of the day not knowing what was making me blue.  On the way home I stopped and got some groceries when I felt moved to pay a little visit to my grandparents.  I have been wanting to visit them for a while, and had these feelings intensified by talking with Di on Sunday's hike about visiting her mom,and my other friend remembering the passing of her dad the other day.  You see my grandparents are at St. Mary's cemetery in New Britain, I drive by it everyday on my way home from work and just felt today was the right day to stop in.  I used to go every year to tidy up there stone and just say hi, but I never went last year with everything going on.  I think I am one of the few people who still go to see them.  My dad was the only child of my grand father but my grandmother had 5 or more kids from a previous marriage.  My dad is the youngest at 59 this year and a good amount of his half siblings are too old to drive down, or in the ground themselves.  I don't know why I feel so compelled to visit and take care of there stone like I do.  My grandmother died 8 years before I was born and my grandfather died when I was 5.  I remember so much in our short time together.  I will always remember walking with my grandfather outside my school showing him proudly the room in which I would learn to read.  I remember him taking me to my first movie, I think it was a Disney cartoon version of Robin Hood, where RH is played by a fox.  We are talking first early memories here so I may be a little blurry on details of stuff.  I think part of it goes on because I am like it not the eldest born male child of the family and must take care of family stuff, I will become I woman but I will always be eldest and maleborn.  I also think allot of has to do that he, my dad, me when I was fully male, and my son all look almost exactly alike.  I remember how grandpa looked like an old shriveled up version of dad, how everyone said I looked like him(though I really see my mom in me now) and I will never forget when my son was born and looked up at me with my fathers eyes.  We are bonded not only by blood but almost identicalness also. I hope what I have isn't genetic and my son ends up like me, I want him to have a normal life.  So I cleaned up the stone a bit, I will go back with flowers or something, and I told them what was going on, and how I wanted to make sure they recognized me when we meet again or in my grandma's case the first time.  I miss that all my grandparents are gone, yet I don't know how I could have broken this to them if they were still here.  How would someone born in the first years of the 1900's take this?  After leaving there site I tried to locate the grave of an old friend who killed himself.  He was so young only 21 and a really good kid.  He just got depressed got shit faced drunk and drove himself into a tree, instantaneous death,and hopefully painless.  He was so talented, he was just starting to get jobs painting murals and stuff and he was working hard on his music.  Ronnie could have been someone, going to his grave brings only sadness.  I didn't find it right away so I left, when I go back to visit the grandfolks I will stop in.  I used to leave him smokes, but I don't do that anymore, so I don't know what I will leave.  It hit me on the way home, today and tomorrow are some milestones for me.  Today is the 3 month anniversary of me leaving a company after being told they thought it was for my own good.  I hate that I was such a pussy, and just left.  Why didn't I stay?  I will always look back at Jan 23rd with disgrace in my heart and bitterness in my mouth.  Tomorrow is big for two reasons.  Firstly it is the 3 month anniversary of starting my rlt full time.  Secondly it is the one year anniversary of going before the board at the GICNE and being certified as being a transsexual.  I remember how scared I was, and how I wanted so bad to smoke even though I had quit the 29th of March. I didn't smoke, I did fine before the board and I have used the memory of how hard it was to get there to keep me going forward.  I look forward to both January 24th and April 24th for years to come.  I had totally forgotten about the board anniversary until Co reminded me of it this evening.    Like I said I am blue, so I am going to take a nice bath and soak the blues away.  Love to all,G'nite.

       The sixth sense...  Ok real life confession time,  I see dead people..   Ok I don't see dead people but I couldn't resist, but I do believe not only in a sixth sense, but that I and others in my family have been blessed/cursed by it.  I may not see dead people, but sometimes you can feel them, or at least their spirits.  Ok, put down the phone and stop dialing Bellview, I assure I am sane, and I am serious.  I have had really long conversations with both my mom and my brother who have many of the same experiences.  Let me explain that I don't believe in hauntings or shit like that, I have a scientific theory on that kind of repetitive event viewing.  Those things in my theory are caused by traumatic events that happened in a specific geographic area and they make total sense.  Ok its time for Ms. Crackpot Science, and no I have no degree in electrical anything, though I am sure the few folks I know with the degrees will pipe in on this.  Ok basic science time, all matter is made of atoms, you me the air around us and the materials in our house.  All atoms have a positive and a negative charge to different parts of them,(protons and electrons) .  As far as I know all electricity creates or gives off a magnetic field of some kind.  I also believe in being a complex mass of atoms with conscience awareness and thought that we produce tons of this magnetic field it is our aura.  Ok so now you know the basics, here is my leap.  When a traumatic event happens we are really projecting our aura big time.  Add this the slight magnetic fields in the materials in our house  and you have the makings of a weird but theoretically explainable tape recorder.  I think that the aura from that traumatic event is stored in the field of the house.  When atmospheric conditions are right, boom you get playback, a scream, a noise, a whipsy vision of someone in pain.  It just seems weird to me how most hauntings take place in a storm and in really old houses.  Old houses are slowly but surely breaking down there integretity so this could be causing playback same with the extra electrical energy from a storm.  Ok since now you think I am nuts or an idiot from my haunting explanation, I do also believe in spirits, but in  a different kind of way.  There are two kinds of spirits, most are trying to say goodbye to a loved one or make amends with somebody before crossing to the next plain of existence.  My mom got to say goodbye to her mother this way, she had died suddenly and came back around 6 weeks later with her dad, and she could hear him tell her to hurry up they had to go.  There are also evil spirits those who prey on spirits in that inbetween place, they are the shadows you may or may not see out of the corner of your eye.  Both my brother and I see these allot, I used to hate hotels and would see these shadows every couple of trips away from home.  I hated hotels, I don't know why, but for some reason they attract these evil spirits maybe because all of the people constantly coming and going?  Ok there is also a feeling you can get when somebody you know or love is in trouble.  I used to get this one allot as a kid, every time my dad was gone for long periods of time I got these feelings of something bad had happened to him.  Well I was close, it was around this time I found out much latter my dad was sleeping around on my mom.  Something bad was happening, maybe I felt his guilt, again who knows.  I have always had deja vu dreaming about shit before it happened.  The dreams were always different then regular dreams almost grainy.They were mostly benign stupid shit like seeing what happened when I said the wrong thing at the wrong time.Some are bigger,  I dreamt as a kid about a mother daughter pair who looked alike that would take me in when I was in need but imprison me.  When I left home at 18 for a while I lived with a family who fit the bill to a T, and they did imprison me with the guilt of religion when I came out as being transgendered.  The really vivid dream I had that I wanted so bad to happen but never did was the night before I had surgery to reset my broken jaw and wire it shut.  I dreamt I was in the or, I had never seen one before,but let me tell you, I was dead on.  In this dream operating room was a little girl on a gurney that wanted to be a little boy.  The doctors were going to switch things for us and give us each others parts.  Its weird how I still remember the industrial green floors and white walls of the operating room and the little girl with her olive skin and her longish brown hair.  I never got my equipment transplant, but I will be corrected by surgery none the less.  So know you are half still going to pick up the phone to call Belview and half going to call me to see what is in your future.  Don't call the hospital because I am sane, and I can't predict the future for others.  I just feel I need to share this stuff with others because I don't feel that the few members in my family that have the courage to talk about this are the only ones.  Not everybody is in tune with stuff, it is a good feeling to have, most of the time.   Ok why I bored you with all that stuff above..  Last night as I put down my knitting and was going to bed, I felt a presence.  I am not sure if it was a spirit or somebody on this plain in trouble crying out for help cosmically.  Whatever it was I felt it.  It may have been Paul trying to say goodbye, I never introduced him to Ashley and he never got to say goodbye to the person he knew me as.  It could have been a dear friend in big trouble, I have several close to real big trouble.  It could have been just an old friend looking for Scott and feeling sad when they couldn't find him, and were just thinking of me.  Of course it could have been the onions and the peppers on that sante fe chicken baggette I got last night on my home from the photo shoot.  I have to be careful with that stuff I can't eat it frequently.  They spirit stayed for about 15 minutes I felt it leave as I was drifting off to sleep. It did not speak to me, of course spirits never speak to me I only feel them, I guess my sense is not as powerful as moms is.  What ever it was I hope it was Paul trying to say goodbye I am just too stretched out to take new pain right now, I hope all is ok with those I care about.  Sorry for the non gender post, but I just had to share this stuff.  We shouldn't be one trick ponies, our lives contain much more than our gender status and if we focus on them too much we get absorbed and become that one trick pony.   Thanks for listening to the rantings of an honest open gal, and try to stay away from the light.  Love to all, take care.

       Strike a pose, there's nothing to it...  Wow photo shoot number two was so cool.  I picked up my photographer after work and went down to Elizabeth park in Hartford.  I love nature and I love to perform for the camera so it was pretty much pure enjoyment.  I have always enjoyed fooling around for the camera but never liked how I looked.  Now I love my look, and really had a cool time.  I had good time posing with nature, climbing trees sitting on rocks and walls.  My favorite shot to pose for came in that odd tree down by the softball fields by the road.  I am not sure what kind of tree it is but it is ancient, its bark shows scars of its long time on earth.  The tree is only about 15 feet high but the branches go out and weep down like a mushroom creating a little room underneath it when in full foliage.  The branches are so long that they curl back up towards the end.  I came across two branches that were just the right size and space apart where I could lay in them like a hammock.  I hope those poses come out.  I had fun picking some of the poses myself including coming across a cut tree stump and pretended to weep for its loss.  I did some rollerblading poses too.  I had to write some stuff for her, but without seeing the pictures most of them don't mean much.  I will decide in the next few days if I am going to share them or wait until her project gets shown to debut them.  She is trying to get Real Art Ways to agree to display her photos, I hope she gets the opportunity she's a good kid.  Oh well its my guilty tv night watching friends while blogging and will be watching kingdom hospital in a bit.   Love to all, G'nite.

       Mystery solved?...  I didn't have time this morning to write about my discovery last night, but I think I solved a big part of the insomnia mystery.  I am hard to wake usually, before we had kids you could have shot a gun off next to my head and I would have slept right through it.  After kids I am easier to wake, and living alone in a big apartment complex has made it more an issue.  I had noticed once or twice my cat around me when I woke up, but being the slow person I had it takes me a while to figure some shit out.  Well 1am this morning/last night I woke up quicker than usual and there was my cat touching her cold nose to mine.  I think my kitty is waking me up.  I love my cat, but she has separation anxiety issues.  I adopted her last fall, her owner an elderly lady had a stroke and spent 6 months in a home before dieing.  Instead of taking the cat home her relatives just stopped by every few days and gave her some food, no love or attention nor anything else.  I can't imagine how lonely she felt for that long all alone.  I got her after the old lady died and her relatives dropped off the cat at a shelter.  I came across her the last day before she was going to be put back into the general population at the shelter.  I needed a companion she needed a home, it was meant to be if you believe in that cosmic path stuff like me.  Unfortunately from all that time alone she has issues, even if I am home she will meow loudly if she doesn't know where I am, she hates being alone, and when I am home she wants to be with me all the time.  I love that she loves me, but sometimes it is too much, especially now that I know she is at least partially responsible for waking me up.

       Hope?...  Awoke this morning to a great song on the clock radio I will talk about in a moment, as I was clearing the few tears from my eyes I saw an awesome story on the news.  There is a doctor trying an ovary transplant, wow that woke me up.  It had been a life long dream of mine to be completely real having all the equipment and knowing all the life of a woman, yes including the monthly friend.  I know this will be not understood by most, but wanting to be real means taking the good and the bad.  Its too late for me for a surgery like that, but I am glad to think that someday it will make some poor tranny real.  I don't know if I have shared the story or not, but I am asking to keep my testicles in a jar after they are removed, that way when boys come a calling on my daughter we can tell the boys to  "be careful, if we even think you tried to be fresh with my daughter we can add you to the jar with the last fresh guy."   If they can use them for implantation in a FTM though I would not only donate them, I'd give them today without delay.  They aren't all that, but let me tell you they sure kept me full of T for years.  Ok enough yapping, the article: St. Louis woman to get twin sister's ovary   Associated Press     ST. LOUIS, Mo. -A doctor in St. Louis is performing what he says will be the first ovary transplant in the United States.   Dr. Sherman Silber says he will remove an ovary from a 24-year-old Alabama woman and transplant it in her identical twin sister, who is infertile.   Silber is director of the Infertility Center of St. Louis at St. Luke's Hospital.   Various organ-donor and reproductive health groups could not confirm Silber's claim that an ovary transplant has never been tried in the United States.   Silber expects the transplanted ovary to begin producing mature eggs for pregnancy in about three months.      The song..  Yes I am a bit of a redneck and with all my music taste I listen to shit kicking country more than anything lately.  This morning the clock radio went off exactly at the beginning of Garth Brooks hauntingly beautiful "The dance"  I won't bore you city folks with all the lyrics but take the time to check it out.  I will share a snippet, forgive me if you are a Garth fan and I mix up a word or two.  Looking back, on the memory of, the dance we shared,beneath the stars above.  For a moment ,all the world was right,how could I'd have known you'd ever say good bye.  And now, I'm glad I didn't know, they way it would end, the way it all would go.  Our lives are better left to chance, I could have missed the pain, but I'd had to miss the dance....   Garth Brooks.  I am in a better place with Co and I, but I am still human, and this song really makes me tear up.  Its like it was written for us, we shared a great dance for over 14 years, its over and even though it hurts at the end, I wouldn't have missed it for the world.  Glad your still around Co, thanks for the Dance hun, hope you get to do again with somebody better real soon.  Love to all, take care, sorry for the tears in the am.

       Neosporin affecting my brain...  Wow what a screwed up day, totally dead at work, rushed over to pay my tuition for school and I am in a really weird mood.  I think my mood is a carry over from yesterday when a friend's comment on an e-mail made me laugh so hard my office mate was ready to call the psych ward at St. Francis on me.  Maybe its stress, maybe its all the pain I have been seeing lately, they further I come out, the more pain I see around me.  It is weird to feel so strong and to have people around you lacking that mindset.  I want to help, but I don't know what I can do.  I am not a trained professional , I don't have all the answers, I know what works, for me, not everyone.  I have the gift of determination and the power of positive attitude, I hopefully won't fail not because I am better or luckier than anybody else, it is because I absolutely refuse to fail.  I just went and put down some money so I can get trained for a decently paying second job to help get things back on track after spending most of savings during my period of unemployment.  I will get a third job if need be, I will do anything short of stealing or prostitution or porno to get there.  Well, ok I'd do porno, but don't think I'm the type.  I doubt the top execs in porn land are looking for a waspish mid 30's pre-op MTF self described lesbian with a soccer mom look to her.  It could be an interesting shoot though, maybe some hot sex in a minivan while in the Starbuck's parking lot, or in the dressing room at Nordstroms.  While I would do it if the money were right, and it would have to be lots of money, I am not expecting a call anytime soon to be shooting   "Lesbian she-male soccer mom's from hell".    Can a she-male technically be a lesbian?   On my way back from the school I swung by the old rink where I used to play rollerhockey, I don't know if was my mood or a deathwish that brought me there.  I was lucky, there were no games going on, only practice.  I could only imagine the greeting I would get if I ran into someone I knew down there, and after playing there for 14 years I kinda knew everybody.  I imagine I would have been greeted with a stick upside my head or other areas once they recognized me.  I may go back, its just one of those things I feel compelled to do, don't know why just have to.  Well I better get back to work, doing laundry and preparing for the second photo shoot tomorrow after work.    G'nite and love to all.

       Tired...  Only did 3 miles on the trail tonight, was just to beat to do anymore.  Fell asleep around 11 last night, up around 4 am.  I just did the Lower part of the trail, also feet killing me, not used to the abuse anymore actually had my socks stuck to my foot from a blood blister.  Oh well a little neosporin and a night off from the trail should heal me ok.  I am going after work to pay my tuition for bartending school tomorrow, and the one great thing I forgot to mention is I get to take 2 weeks off from electrol, no not being able to shave, no redness for days, no painful hour.  I also got a hold of the Montreal group today, they are sending me a package, maybe I should think about taking this approach with the other Dr.  G'nite I am going to watch a bunch of toothless Canadian guys skate around and beat the shit out of each other while I go knit my blanket some more, I am more than halfway done.  When I am finished and I find a new server to put pics up I will show you all my work. Love to all.

       Comedy against the clock...  Ok I have to post,but I don't have gobs of time this morning.  I have always been into non-mainstream mainstream pop culture, ok if your head didn't just blow up, stuff like Star Trek, the Simpsons when they first arrived, all the Steven King and David Lynch stuff and my favorite South Park.  I used to be a South Park devote, and have lots of mp3 and wav soundbites on cd I got a few years back.  I love those little foul mouthed youngsters, but things do have a way of being left behind, especially silly immature things.  I did though just install into my computer last month a sound bite from one of my favorite episodes.  It is the episode where all the boys fall in love with the new female teacher only to find she is lesbian and only dates other lesbians.  Well the boys in their innocence have no idea what a lesbian even is, and think it to be an ethnicity not a sexual preference.  The most idiotic of the group Cartman has this quote that I put onto the pc at startup "hey guys you know what?.. My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my Grandpa was Lesbian, that makes me quarter lesbian".   Well I have always loved his naive innocence, and his impossible explanation in trying to fit in found in that quote but after turning on the computer yesterday it hit me, and it hit me hard.  If my kids ever have kids, and my preferences stay the course,their kids will technically have a grandfather who is a lesbian.  Funny life imitating art in a silly way, I don't know what we will tell the grandkids if they come at all, we just got over getting our kids used to it.  Might be one of those funny Sunday dinner conversations 30 years from now.  Love to all, take care.

       Mondays in mom and pop America...  Man I hate Mondays, back to work, and evening electrol.  I have never been the corporate type, I have always dealt with mom and pop type people.  Real people with small businesses built on their own hard work, and flowing through their viens.  I never had to deal with corporate America, I'm glad to have worked for small enough companies that they get to know you, so when they find out about this, they already know how good of person you are, and not jump to conclusions so fast.  Of course it also really screws with some of their heads because we have shattered their perception of us. On that subject, I was talking to another tranny the other night whose marriage is not ending anywhere near well as mine, and I even felt bad Co was there while this new friend was in pain over things.  She is having trouble getting over the fact that her wife can't stand her as a she, even though she was never much of a manly man before.  I explained to her something I learned early on in this process.  We have known ourselves not to be manly or macho, but we were seen differently by others, hence some of us blended well.  We don't only have to deal with issues of self image in this,but even more importantly how others see or saw us.  We know what we have always been it is harder for others to adjust since they saw us as something totally different.  This is a tough world to live in, and tougher by our journey, but if you take the time to figure some shit out, it just gets a wee bit simpler.    Recovering from yesterday..  Not tired from the workout, but shit my calves hurt.  I am going to go tomorrow after work, and latter in the week I need to reshoot some pictures for that photo project I had volunteered for.  They will be more action shots this time, I think I will try the park over by my brothers apartment this time, a little closer to work and now a safe neighborhood.  Another split sleep night last night 9-1 and then 3-5:30, took my pills too late I think again.  Definately no stress after a great day yesterday.   Pulled the trigger..  Called and enrolled in bartending school today.  If I want to get back on track for surgery in 05 I have to get a second job to make up for what I lost being unemployed for over 2 months.  I will not get there sitting in front of my computer, and I haven't hit Powerball yet, so what will change there?  I will switch more to an inside postion at my day job and go out a day or two per week on the road, and the others work out of the office.  At night I can tend bar 2 or 3 nights a week to help pay for surgery. Its only a two week course so I will hopefully be working quickly, if anybody has suggestions on a nice GLBT friendly place to look for bartending jobs let me know, but I am also open to pub type straight places too.   I know this is going to be a tough time working that much, but what other choice do I have?  I hate being in transition with a passion.  I feel like a freak, like a dirty she-male, want hot she-male action call Ashley at 1-800-she-male. Sorry to all the she-males out there, but you can do your thing I'll do mine.  Funny thing though there is always an ad in the back of the advocate from some ts named Ashley who is from the area, she claims to be "CT's hottest".  Hey to each.  I just have to get on path to make sure this part of the trip is just long enough to fulfill HBSOC, so they can be sure, and so I get my date I want.  I don't want to be in this uncomfortable place long, it feels unnatural to me, I have never wanted to be a freak I  merely wanted to be whole.  I also attempted to contact the Montreal Dr.'s today, got the answering machine, and my God my French sucks. They have the end of the message in English but I always try to translate. They are not my first choice, but my first choice still hasn't gotten back to me.  I will get info from Canada and then try Dr. Bowers again.  It is so hard for her, she is busy beyond belief, hopefully she will get back to me soon, I have my heart set on a date now, and I like to get things to feel right on certain stuff.  No matter if I get this done in the desserts of Colorado or my home and native land, I am sure I will emerge better, yet battle torn.  I have also been looking into tattoos more.  I have my mind set on matching phoenix's for co and I.  I just have to find one she likes.  We both have attachments to the symbol of the Phoenix. I am being reborn through fire in the process, in fact I chose my name since it has a meaning of  rising from the Ashes.     But Co's and I relationship has also risen from the ashes, we seem to be so much better as friends then as a couple, it took the burning down of our marriage to find that out.  I of course am also getting the cute little butterfly on my left calf. And I am working on something for the small of my back also.  I have always wanted a tattoo, I could just never get what I wanted before,Scott getting a butterfly would have gotten my ass kicked, but it fits me as Ash.  If I do go with the Montreal Dr.'s, I will be adding a little  Fabrique au Canada.  I will have to check the spelling but it translates to made in Canada. I was planning the same kind of thing when I was considering Thailand, but who wants to die half way across the world?  I will update you all when I find the right phoenix symbol. I am enjoying so much of the info I didn't know on some occult and tribal cultures.  I was looking today and found some neat stuff about the cabbal and how they believe in a hemaphrodite god like I do, hmm sounds like fun research time. If I cannot find something she likes, I have found several nice Thunderbird symbols from Native American cultures that are great.  I do have a bit of Indian blood in me, unfortunately it is a small amount from an all but extinct Canadain tribe,so no casino for my family.  I won't post until late tomorrow, no time in the am, and blading after work. Love to all, G'nite and take care.

       Two tall broads and this short dude, alone in the woods...  Went hiking today with some tranny buds, like a 6 mile rollerblading trip wasn't enough for a day.  It was fun, I can only imagine the guy who kept checking the three of us out thoughts, not to mention his conversation around the water cooler tomorrow, hence the title.  I really had fun, it was nice to get away from the structure of support group and be outside in nature and just talk about life past, present and our plans for the future.  I haven't been alone with a guy in the woods for years, and my FTM friend is somebody I have always considered nothing but the truest of men, it felt safe to be out there with him there in some weird but good kind of way.  We talked about all three of our love for the woods, and how we all used to go hang out there, mostly alone as kids, just to escape stuff.  It was also Di's first time in the woods as Di, I feel special I got asked to come.  It feels good to be accepted into the fold after being so alone all these years in dealing with this stuff, now I am getting help and lending support when others just need somebody there with them.  This is the part of the journey that makes me feel blessed, there are so many good people here, all willing to help, and some who need it, we are all a great community, glad they let me in.  As for today, I haven't felt this tired since we were building the rock wall gardens at the old house.  I remember one particular Saturday where we worked outside all day, moving big rocks by hand, and levering.  I had two back to back roller hockey games starting at 6 in the evening, and then came home  took a quick shower and then showed somebody how much I loved her, and went and smoked a few cigs before bed.  This was one of the few days I can remember in my life where I can truly say that if my life were over right then and there, I would have died happy, and I am half surprised I didn't. I miss the almost super energy I had while a man, but I don't miss being a man.  I still love to do so much stuff, but sometimes don't have the same drive I did before, but if I can do 6 miles on the skates, and 5 miles in the woods, I am sure my drive is just fine.  It also felt good to get dirty today, without a yard to work in I don't get to do that as much.  I'm glad I am not a total girly girl like my little sister.  I don't think the world could stand another princess. Love to all, g'nite.

       The Zen of the trail...  Went out blading first thing this morning with lots on my mind, came back with little.  I got out early so there were not lots of people clogging the trail, which gave me space to fly and quietness to think.  I did my usual 6 mile trip and it felt good.  I tried something a little different today.  I bought some cheapo hand weights the other day to help work on my arms, and when I got to my first crossing I just bonged the little metal post that keeps cars off the track.  It sounded like a Tibetan gong, like I imagined a monk would use in an elaborate prayer ceremony.  Something just clicked then and I decided that for each segment between crossings I would focus on what was bothering me, and how to resolve the conflict.  When I got to the crossing I would gong the next post signifying it was time for the next issue.  I did quite well, a few of my problems I did more than once, since I was only able to improve my mindset not solve it.  But in the end I feel refreshed and not so burdened.  I haven't fully solved all my issues, but you show me someone who has, and I will show you how dishonest they are with themselves.  I won't get into what I had to work through, I just have to set lower expectations for myself on certain issues, and I need to accept that there are tolls to pay on this road to Wellsville. I know at least if I am not more at peace with myself from this, I will at least be exhausted enough to sleep tonight.  I cannot wait to go out with Di and the boy(s) to do a little hiking.  I really want to focus on enjoying the rest of today instead of spending it all day trying to work out problems.  Take care, love to all.

       Really special night...  Tonight was a really big night in my life, I brought Nicole into my world.  I am so proud of her, and so happy she still thinks enough of me to come tonight.  It was a fun night, and we met lots of cool people from all the different groups.  It was nice to have my best friend with me in a world I have going solo in.   She met all the nice people in our group and the other groups and even got into some really good discussions on her own.  She is a really good person, and is good talking to people about this.  I cannot believe how far she has come on this journey, the night I told her, one of her initial reactions was to not want anything to do with me, or let me see the kids.  It is amazing how she has gotten comfortable with all this by me not pushing, and her openness to lots of this due to our love and respect for each other.  I know she won't go the full trip and still be my partner, but I am quite sure she will always be my friend.  I am not mad at her for not coming, somethings like sexuality can't be overcomed, nor would I want her to do it for me.  It was just so nice to finally get her to come out and be seen as the wife of a tranny.  We even continued a discussion on how little involvement there is by the clinic for some of us, she is concerned about people's mental health, I spoke from how overwhelmed the poor Dr.'s are already, with out having people come in who don't need to.  I really appreciate her honesty and her concern not only for me, but for others like me.  There was also some cool moments talking to people.  I was talking to a friend about going hiking together tomorrow, and she was asking me if I had been to a certain park.  I won't mention the name of the park since we are going tomorrow, but it has a funny name that she made a pun about.  I replied to her" no I haven't been there, but I've been by."  So I quickly made the joke" well I haven't been bi, but I think I'd like to try."  Well in a crowd like that, there was a nice bi man listening in who said he had and it is fun.  I laughed my ass off, not used to being able to be so honest and open about sexuality and gender.  Another cool moment was when Co and I were talking to someone from the group who asked if I had a date in mind for surgery yet.  I told her the story and the date next March.  She asked if I was into dates or numerology and I said not really.  Well Co quickly reminded me that I was on certain things like our wedding day.   My grandmother, one of my grandfathers, and an uncle all died on Nov. 9 in various years, so I insisted that we get married that day to break up the bad karma on that date in my family. After telling the story I quipped, "well unfortunately,it really didn't work !"  Then it hit me, it did work, and quite well.  On that date I married my best friend who loves me enough to help and stand by me through all this, even though it means she looses her husband.  I couldn't have asked to marry a better person ever.  I am truly blessed by her friendship and I know good fortune will grace her someday.  Before going we took the kids to Mcd's for a quick bite.  While sitting there a catchy little tune came on, I don't remember if it was Billy Joel or Elton John, but it was of that ilk.  I noticed myself doing my usual dancing with my upper body.  There were some highschool boys eating there, they saw me doing this and just got back to their talking.  I told Co, "see that ,that's one of the reasons why I did this."  If I had been my male self doing that, I would have gotten harassment, now I can be me without fear of sticking out.  It may sound silly to you guys, but little things like this mean so much to me after having to hold stuff inside for so long.  I love to be able to express myself freely, to be girly, and to sit dance anytime I fucking feel like it.  My athletic day tomorrow, blading in the am, hiking in the pm, working out some anger. GRRRRR.  Love to all, take care.

       Honesty?...  Well after the other night out and about and not really knowing how to interact as a woman with gen women I thought I need to go learn.  So where does every 30 something young lonely person who really doesn't drink or like a sea of people go, yup the personals.  Under the category woman seeking woman, I posted my picture, its a nice one too, I titled it "looking for friendship maybe more."  Nice and sweet, I am just looking for a few friends who happen to be lesbians.  I also put a cold dead honest description of my life, pre-op mtf, with kids, going thru a divorce, etc...  No responses yet, hmmm, I wonder why? Can you say,BAGGAGE? I did the same thing a while back under woman seeking man, and didn't put up the whole tranny thing, I was beating them off with a stick.  Of course if I pursued them and they found my stick, I'd be the one who got the beating.  I don't know, I know that online personals aren't the best place to find women, even as friends.  I just need to make sure I am well rounded in my circle of friends.  NO offense to all my tranny buddies, but I am sure you have friends who are other things too.  I am not looking to shut any group out, old or new, I just need to get ready for when I feel confident enough to start dating again.  I am the kind of person who needs somebody in my life, not to complete me, but to compliment my good points, like whipped cream on my sundae, or for me to be the whipped cream to their sundae.  I also need them to be honest with me on my bad points, with a good swift kick in the ass.  I have always fallen in love with the kind of person  who will be totally honest with you good or bad, people like that are hard to find, but worth the effort.  Gotta run. Love to all, take care.

       Weekend plans...  Went and got my license for torturing poor defenseless aquatic creatures by dangling tortured earth eating insects on sharp hooks today.  It was my first fishing license as Ash, and while I love firsts I don't know how much I can enjoy fishing anymore.  I don't know if I am truly becoming a liberal because of who I am allowing myself to finally be?  Or is it I am rebelling against those conservatives I used to hang with since they mostly rejected me?  I tend to think though I am tired of all the suffering I see going on around me, and in my own life, I don't feel right making other things suffer.  I never did enjoy the suffering the fish went through, but I tolerated it for my own comfort, no wonder I have this fate, I was a dickhead.  Co and I are taking the kids fishing tomorrow, it is less about fishing then it is about spending time as a family not doing something inside.  This is the first weekend they aren't coming over.  I really hate living alone, but it is only a train stop on this journey, a painful but necessary stop on the road to a better place.  After we go fishing my dad is watching the kids so Co and I can go to a potluck supper at the community center.  It is her first time into my world, and one of our first times out as just friends, it should be fun though.  Then its back home and rollerblading alone first thing Sunday am, don't know what after that.  I really need to get rid of some of this pent up aggression I feel lately, I think I will push myself hard on the trail.  I actually pulled out my limp biscit disc and caught myself doing over 90 on the highway this morning.  I don't know what the deal is, but aggressive Ashley doesn't pass well, and I haven't felt this way in a long time, I will have to see if I can release it through exercise since other options don't exist right now.  If that doesn't work I will contact Dr. Sterner ASAP, I don't want to screw things up now, by going backwards, but I also have to be healthy on the other side.  Back to firsts, I failed to mention my first paycheck as Ash last week.  It was so cool to actually get paid for working as a woman, it makes me feel real.  I was collecting unemployment, but I hate taking assistance from the state to begin with, and I looked at that money as Scott money, money I earned as a man.  It feels good that I can function in the business world as myself and get paid for it, too bad its not for a little more money.  I also worked today for the first time with only blush and eye makeup on(ok as Ash, if I wore that stuff as Scott I would have had grief).  I actually am finally healed from mondays electrol and I didn't feel like getting all dolled up today.  I love being a girl but even this girly girl needs a day off from the covergirl shit every now and again.  I'll post when I can. Love to all, take care, see some of you tomorrow night, with my baked ziti with chicken and homemade marinara sauce. Bring your pepcid I love to use the spices.

       Wisdom, karma, and the Divinity of depression and such...  I was going to blog this morning on my further dissection of the events of last night.  I hate being in this phase of things right now, recovery.  Usually after a low time I spend lots of time evaluating everything so that the next low period in my life can be easier to traverse.  I need to stop living life as a scientific formulation, and just fucking enjoy it.  I have been missing jokes, over analyzing intentions and on guard lately.  I need to get back to basic Freud where a cigar is sometimes just a plain cigar, and enjoy others and enjoy situations.  I have been an observer of life for too long now.  Before it was a necessary defense to learn how to fit in and shield myself from discovery.  There's not much left to discover, I am an out transsexual right now, who knows how long it will last, and if I want to change it now I would have to move and change jobs, but I'm not anywhere near done yet.  I don't know if it was the cranberry juice clearing out the cobwebs in my mind, or the few days I have had to prepare to delve into it, since picking up this great little paper in Great Barrington the other day.  It is called Wisdom, the website is urlLink Wisdom   I will let you guys take your own journey there, and I will not reproduce the authors works that I enjoyed, it might screw up my karma.  The first article centered around the paradox of doing and being, and that we are not in total control of our universe.  Basically if we do not embrace who we are and just go from there we will be filled with negative energy and lose the joy out of life.  Over simplified by me, but also fully embraced. If I except who and what I am then I will be happy.  Ok I heard the brakes of the minds of all who aren't trannies just lock up back up and read a few times.  You all are being a little to over simplified in thinking,   "you say your happy with your fate and who you are yet you are pursuing a life altering change".     Sorry for speaking for you, but I am sure I am right on for this one.  You fail to see there is more than binary in this life, more flavors than just vanilla and chocolate.  Yes I am a biological man, but I am a biological transsexual man.  That is my fate that I must embrace and not hate, the fact that I am transsexual and I must work through being as such.  Will I emerge something else on the other side as I continue to grow, who knows it all depends how honest I am with myself, how I find exploring to be, and if I allow myself to be true to myself.  It will be fun to find out, and I do not feel burdened as much by who I am meant to be in my life.  The second spoke on the divinity of depression.  I loved lots of this one.  It spoke on how we as a society just give out pills like candy to people when they are depressed and cut off the path of communication between what is causing the depression and the outside world.  If we just give a pill to make it go away how can we grow and heal from it?  I personally find depressed or down times in my life to be some of my most in touch with my soul or creative self.  I go from commentator on the world, like my present mode, into myself so much I open doors to emotions and thoughts and then exorcise them like demons through my poetry.  I am not an overly depressed person, nor do I look at it in my case as a disease, it is a process in life, nothing more nothing less.  What we take or bring into that process makes the difference.  On divinity if depression was pure divinity then I just had my turn to be god the last few months.  But seriously it brought to me some good thoughts on divinity.  I am now more spiritual than religious, I believe in God, but I am not sure what God is, and what Gods role is, notice I have been leaving out pronouns since I believe God is above gender.  I was raised to believe in the Christian God, and allot of me still does, it make the most sense, but had I been raised as a Hindu would it still make the most sense to me?  The parent in me sees a benevolent creator, one who loves his creations(sorry for the pronouns) but lets them go on their own after a certain point.  I look back to teaching my kids to walk, we at first helped them up and helped them take a few steps and such.  But we had to let them do it on their own after awhile, if we kept helping what incentive would they have for doing it on their own?  Soon they were trying it by themselves, and we were there to catch them if they fell, but not interfering in the process, all the time not letting them know we were there to see how much they were willing to do without having the security of a parents involvement.  This is one way I envision God, loving us, helping us when we fall, but letting us grow, explore and giving us the opportunity to fall.  The scientist in me sees almost an accountant type of god, one who is constantly tallying pluses and minuses and reformulating your karma constantly.  I am a big believer in karma, and believe that good deeds done without thought of reward go rewarded and bad things go punished.  I don't know if this is true or not, like I said it is the scientist in me.  The whole universe can be explained through physics and one of the basic laws of physics is that each action has an equal and opposite reaction.  Ok, I never took physics but I read lots on it, so I may be wrong on the fact of it being a law.  It could be a theory, laws cannot be broken in physics, theories can.  But I do believe we are accountable for our actions, not to be cast into a lake of fire when we die, but in the joys we experience in our existence.  I don't know though using this theory how to explain a very nice guy I have known online for awhile and recently met.  He is truly one of the most selfless and all around nice people I have ever met, always giving, always looking out for others feelings.  Yet for all his hard work, he has a bad fate, he is stricken with a disease that will cut this existence short, yet I see no bitterness in him.  He doesn't believe in a Christian God, yet he still lives his life the way Jesus taught his people to, not for fear of burning in hell, but because it is the right way to do so.  I know this person will be let into the best place in the after life.   He is being good without having the fear that if he isn't he will perish. A much stronger act of goodness then most Christians I know.  I wish him all the best and if I could would send him some of my good karma in a hearbeat.  The romantic in me thinks that god is love, and we are all creations of his love.  Or that gods energy from his love live in each of us, and it is this communal energy that will someday reform into god with parts of all of the good parts of us and all our lives we have lived.  I don't know which is right if any of them, I hope it is a long time before I find out for sure, I still have work left to do in my life yet. Sorry for all the deep thoughts on a Friday. Love to all, take care.

       Lots left to learn...  Went out right after work to a mixed event in Hartford, it was really my first time out as Ash in a non-tranny setting.  I noticed something quite sad, as much as I am good at coming out to people, being out at work, answering anyone with a legitimate question, I am lost at knowing how to socially interact as Ash.  I cannot believe how this was missed in my plans, I researched so much on other stuff, but never on how to relate socially as a woman.  I am not talking about how to relate to people or talk to others as Ashley I picked that up quickly, I am talking about the fine art of flirting and how to attract who you are attracted to at a bar.  I think I never bothered even thinking about this since I hoped Co would come along.  She isn't but my life does go on, just like hers will, and I need to learn how to be good at that kind of stuff.  I am not looking for anything serious at all, I need time to heal from the loss of Co.  That being said I still could use some friends and maybe something more, I don't know.  I am pushing forward with the divorce so the both of us can be free, it is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, even harder than telling Co in the first place, but it is what is best for both of us.  Who knows maybe someday she'll change her mind, but if I was the type to wait for somedays I wouldn't be in my RLT right now.  Life is very short, and if you don't take the opportunity to go after what you truly want out of life you will miss it and grow bitter.   Bitterness ruins life, and consumes all the enjoyment out of this wonderful life.  I can't stand this bitterness any longer, I have become allergic to it, and unable to stomach it any longer.  That being said I will have to go out some more and learn how to deal with relations as a women, ok a trans woman for now.  Over time I will get the hang of it I am a pretty fast learner.  Tonight was tough, due to time constraints I didn't have time to change my whole outfit, I just changed from my pants I wore to work into a nice flowing skirt.  While I loved the way I looked that isn't exactly what most lesbian wear these days. Now before I ignite an all out flame war, I am aware that there is no uniform for being a lesbian, and they come in all flavors.  I am not into total butches, if I want a hardened, crass, emotionally always on guard kind of person I will just go get a man instead.  I am sorry since there are some nice butches out there, but I am just relating the kind of butches I know from working with them for almost two decades.  I am looking for somebody a little more blurry I don't mind a little masculine, just not 100% butch, I have been friends with them in the past, they just aren't who I want to spend my life with.   Its the same thing with men.  I find some men very attractive, but I am pretty sure a relationship between me and a guy won't work.  The only way I could see me with a man is maybe with a FTM, most aren't as bad as real men are, they lack the total self centeredness a gen man has.  I know first hand what I speak of, come on, what is more self centered then breaking up your marriage so you can go become a woman?  Its like the line in that movie Normal, where Jessica Tandy tells her husband "you must be a man, only a man could be this selfish."  I know I am selfish and that is my cross to bear, but I don't want to subject myself to having to deal with selfish men.  I know I am beating this to death, but sometimes I need to rant and bitch.  I am so used to being good at what I do, I do things the best I can do and no less.  That is why I am so disappointed to find I am big-time deficient in something so import.  Like I said I have some time, as I go out more and more I will become comfortable with my new skin in that setting and be where I need to be in that department.  I already have done so much better than even I anticipated in so many of the things I knew would be difficult.

       Two things to share...  Sorry I didn't come back and post last night I have a really good thing I need to post about too, my mom.  But the post about mom is too long before going to work, so maybe tonight while I chat online.  I just got so busy last night between talking to my dad, starting work on my book, chatting and watching Matrix Revolutions finally, even though I saw it in theatres.    Point one..  watching Maxtrix Revolutions, which I highly recommend the whole series to anyone who can watch dark sci-fi, I noticed a line that I missed before.  One of the main characters Morpheous is commenting on the end of war between man and machines and says" I have dreamt that this day would come, but now that it is here all I can ask is, is it real? "  Holy shit, I had to stop the dvd.  That statement is almost word for word what I imagine myself saying sometimes next year when the sedation wears off and I get my wits about me.  I think it was me taking my hormones early last night that made me cry, but I won't need hormones to make me cry after I come to after surgery, but they will be good tears indeed.  Again if you haven't watched them all three are great and deal with issues of fate, karma, destiny, and how to make the most of out difficult situations.  These movies is what I credit for my so called right headedness I have gotten comments on so often, they taught how to look a problems differently.  Of course there are all sorts of special effects and kung fu wire fighting too.   Point two..  I have been chatting with people online allot lately, I don't know if its because I have made myself so visible or what.  I am asked allot about my own transition, and that is why I am writing the book.  One of the most important parts that I feel the need to share right now is the pace of this all.  I have gone slow and steady myself, I could have started RLT last May, but I would have lost my support system since they weren't ready yet.  I equate this whole thing to kind of like the story of a NASCAR rookie.  There are several rookies this year on the race circuit and one of them has been listening to his crew chief for advice and it is paying off so far.  On a short track you cannot drive the car as fast as it can go, or you end up into the wall and out of the race.  This drivers crew chief put a raw egg under his gas pedal to remind him to go fast but not too fast.  That's how transition has to be if you want it to be successful.  We all want to get there yesterday, but if we rush things we are very likely to fail.  I am glad that I took it at a "slow" pace myself, I know I could be going to the next board meeting asking for surgery approval if I went as fast as I could, but I could have also crashed hard too.  I will get there in time, and I will still have some folks from my old life to be happy with me.  Take care, have a great day, and of course love to all.

       Just a quickie...  I might post more latter,but I am really tired, and I am starting to work on a book about coming out and passing, etc.  I just find it so weird than when I talk to so many people they don't do things the same way I do, and I am beginning to think maybe that's why I have been successful so far at it.  I need to share how I do and did things with others.  Some think I just got lucky, but I had to work my ass off to put this whole package together, and if an idiot like me can do it, I am sure others should be able to pull it off too.  I will keep you all up to date, right now I am working on the boring intro chapter about my boring life, but with all my secrets for success in the format I want to use it should be a small book of 150-200 pages.  I just need to pour my creative energy into something, since I never heard back about the play I auditioned for, I think nobody else bothered to try out, and that has to suck after Toby and crew worked so hard to put together some really nice stuff.  I just saw a preview for a funny looking movie about two gals(from My big fat Greek wedding) who are performers, see a mob hit, and runaway to LA for their lives.  When they get to LA they decide to start working in a drag bar performing, so we have that whole victor Victoria thing going on again, women pretending to be me, pretending to be women.  It just sounds like the mindless comedy I need right about now.  The link is  urlLink Movie  I will be on latter to talk about my day.

       Just a quick joke...  Got this joke from a woman I got into a flame war with awhile back over the term transgendered.  She left the board, but I kept in touch with her, and we have become online friends.  When I saw this I almost pissed my pants, it is the truest joke I have seen in a very long time. Love to all, take care.

       Strange Days indeed...  Who ever thought being out could be so fun, yet so sad at times too?  Allot of people have warned me this wouldn't be easy, and its not, but see my motto up above just below my banner.  It has been easier than I thought it would be, so many people are so cool with things and really don't give a shit.  Some really aware people suspected it before they heard or before I came in.  I was starting to show, with the hair, the weight loss, the re-arranging of body fat, and of course how my face changed so much.  Today though had a tough morning, one of my favorite customers who I have hung out with away from work stuff just ran away when I came into the store.  It is a real mom and pop operation, a husband and wife in their early 40's own it, and we have been friends for about 4 years or so.  I walked in said hi to the husband really quick and the wife was on the phone, not wanting to do two intro's I just looked around until she finished when I came around the corner the husband hightailed it down to his office.  I could tell the wife recognized me, and asked her" you recognize me don't you N?  I don't think G did."  Holly shit did she get snotty with the head move and the pointing finger and"Yes he did."  When I told her who I worked for she said snidely" we buy from X we don't need stuff from YOU."  Wow I was shocked and hurt, but I thanked her for her past business gave her my card if she ever needs anything and walked out the door head up, walking proud, but hurt.  I knew it would come eventually that one of my core customers would be too freaked out by this, it sucks it was them, but I cannot live my life for other people.  I just don't get why me changing my sex changes my ability to service a customer well.  I hate to say this, but it didn't take long to get over this incident, which actually scared me a little that I have gotten a little cold and don't care anymore about loosing folks.  The rest of the day went very well, everybody else was in a rah rah good for you hun kind of mood, and glad to see me happy for the first time in years.  I sometimes wonder why the fuck I have the good fortune to have a very understanding group of customers who actually support me in doing this, while others can't even get a job?  What makes me so deserving while others suffer for no apparent reason?  I am thankful for it, but I do not understand it.  I have had so few issues with my coming out, I know I pass very well for the most part, but most of my customers recognize me right away so I cannot hide at work, around town I am just another woman, a semi tall woman with a big jaw and some crazy hair but I don't get called freak to my face, usually.  I also caught myself doing something stupid.  I felt bad for a bit after the rejection I got so I went and got something sweet, a black cherry blo pop to be precise.  So I am sucking my sadness away(easy with the comments) enjoying my sugar when I noticed the truck who was about to pass me on the four lane road slowed down to ride beside me.  I looked over and the passenger, young man about 20ish was staring at me, and the driver would too at times.  This went on for a mile of two, and started to freak me out, so I went back to my lollipop and lowered the visor mirror to make sure I looked ok, all was fine.  I left it down and again started sucking the lollipop, and when I caught myself in the mirror I realized the problem.  I looked like I was enjoying it a little too much, and licking it in a suggestive manner.  The boys were still next to me so I gave them a wave and shook my head "no" with a big grin on my face.  They proceeded to pass me.  If I did this as the old me, no wonder I got called fag allot towards the end.  I guess I will have to be more careful, and the only way a penis is going to be in my mouth, is in somebody's sick dreams.  Ok absolute best reaction to introducing the new me.  I was in another family type store up in western mass. It is owned by a husband and wife a few years older than I and the husbands brother orders the pet stuff.  So I walk in looking for the brother, I hand him my card, and the questions start on my relation to Scott.  Just as he is asking me how I am related to him the brother, the owner comes around the corner looks at me, does a double take, and says out loud   "Holy fucking shit, its Scott!" right in front of customers I might add.  The brother starts looking around confused looking behind me, like Scott is standing back there and then looks into my face confused and asks "what you're Scott?"  "Not anymore I told him."  He quickly turned beet red, his eyes started to flutter, and he started breathing heavy, he fell back onto a pile of fertilizer in a half faint, half fall.  His brother and I helped him back up, I originally thought I killed him.  He couldn't talk right, stuttering and shit, but he gathered his composure and we talked for a few minutes, he even got the name right right off the bat.  While I was talking to him I overheard the brother talking to a customer who was shocked at my situation, the brother quipped" hey I'm from New York, nothing bothers me."  I think that is the new state motto or something, every customer who is from New York tells me this verbatim, like they are born enlightened and the rest of us poor morons suck.  I waited to things calmed down and promised to come back in about a month if he thought he could handle it, and wanted me back, he said yes to both.  It was scary when it happened, but looking back it was some of the funniest 20 minutes of my work life.    I am so glad I didn't listen to all the bad stuff about coming out at work.  I work in the third most GLBT friendly industry,just behind theater and hair salons.  I am careful about stuff, I don't go in waving my ts/tg flag, I just be me and walk in with confidence.  I do fall from time to time, but we all fall in life.  This is no walk in the park, but when my time is done on this earth I can without doubt say I did it my way and I tried.  Win, loose or draw I tried with all I had kept true to myself, and lived my life with joy, not fear.  If I happen to die because of it, I hate to say it is worth it.  I really hope some homophobe asshole doesn't freak out on my one day and talk me off to the woods to kill me, but I won't live my life fearing that scenario either.  I have been given one of two things by my creator, either allot of bravado, or zero common sense.  I hope its the bravado. G'nite and love to all.

       Finding friends while looking for help...  I went onto one of my boards to post a question on my insomnia to see if others suffer from it too when I came across an email from somebody I just met the other day who seemed down.  I sent her an email and then found she was online and has yahoo messenger.  So I went and installed yahoo messenger and got a hold of her, we chatted like two old women who had know each other our whole lives.  It is so cool to be able to make new friends so much easier than it was before.  It goes to show you two things, good things happen when you get to be true to yourself, and in some sick and twisted way this curse has some blessings mixed in.  I have met so many really great people who I would never had met if I wasn't this way and they weren't too.  I'm not going as far as being thankful I am this way, I am just thankful there are others like me who share a common story, and past even though we all went thru it so alone at the time.  I won't use her name without permission, but  I am happy to have you as a friend D, glad you decided to stay, and glad we can be friends.   We all need as many as possible in this journey, allot of us fall, its good to have somebody to pick you up when you need it, and a good feeling that you are in a good enough place to offer help back. No am post tomorrow,(actually its already today, its 12:30) I'm tired even with the insomnia. Love to all, see you in the pm.

       Silly observations...  Ok, do you know that most of you gen girls are pigs compared to men when it comes to restrooms?  I have never seen a men's room as dirty as most of the ladies rooms.  Of course there are some really cool ones like the ones down at Moheagan Sun with the automatic plastic toilet seat covers, but nice ones are the exception to the rule.  I don't know if there are allot of pre-op tranny gals where I go or what, but I have never seen so much pee on seats before.  I know allot of you gals do the hover thing,(I have even mastered it, for now) and I know how vaginas tend to spray.  I am quite familiar with how they work even though I have never owned one yet, I even got to see my son come out of one while I assited in his birth.  I really think you gals need to try a lower hover height, I assure you the germs won't jump up that high.  If this is too hard, have you ever thought to wipe the seat for the next person, sometimes people are in a hurry and don't have time to check first.  The other thing I have noticed is I can find out how my customers really felt about Scott when they don't recognize me.  I actually had a customer go on about me for about 5 minutes before I stopped her and told her it was me.  I didn't get an A for my past dealings with her, but I'd call it above average.  I felt so bad for not stopping her, but it was so cool to hear what somebody thought of you first hand without them having to be nice.  So many people think I have a rare last name, but it is a very common French last name, and when people do ask me if I am related to Scott, I tell them  kinda, sorta...   I don't know how much I want to do this to people, but for those people I had trouble reading in my last job, I may use this to figure them out.  It is just so fun sometimes to see peoples reactions to this whole thing, and sometimes it really sucks when someone who used to be friendly to you acts like your a leper.  Hey its all good, I know this is the right thing for me to do, and if they can't handle it, that's their issue. G'nite love to all.

       Bad day...  Have you ever had a day so bad you actually looked forward to the pain of electrol as a the best part of the day? Suzanne tells me I am good with pain, but I hate it, and I usually pop 3 advils before going to help.  I can't imagine the discomfort I will feel after my SRS.  Today was just so bad from yesterday's fiasco at my dad's.  I apologize in advance but I really hate my sister and have decided she has always been a cunt, and will always be one.  She has been such a mega bitch her whole life its no wonder one brother hates being a man, and the other one is turned off by women altogether.  I know it is biological instead of environmental, but if I wasn't this way, I'd be disgusted by women too.  To fill you guys in on how my sister is.... I told her about my transgender problem part 2(yes I came out to her back in 88/89) last summer while under the care of her boss who is one of the best cosmetic dentists in the state.  She was pissed and made me promise not to tell her boss about this, and to promise not to come back as Ash to get anywork done after starting my rlt.  So as with most stuff in my life some shit got delayed, and the final checkup took place about a week into my rlt.  So me being the loving sibling actually went out in the one male outfit I saved and went to the appointment.  It was pure hell, it had taken me so much to put Scott to rest, and now I had to go be him for a few hours.  I handled it ok, but I cried almost the whole way home, I hated going back, it even felt dirty for some reason.  To make the whole day better, some asshole teenagers yelled out Fag to me, and where trying to pick a fight with me.  I ignored them, and just went back to my car and sped off like a coward.  I told myself it was for my sister this will help her see I still love her.  Well after I got home that day, I called her to tell her how much I loved the new teeth.  This is when she really pissed me off by telling me her boss knew, she had told him.  I could have killed her. Why torture me, when you go and tell him anyway?  Yesterday she dropped an even better one on me.  I asked how her boss was, and if he has commented on the whole situation.  Her comment was  yeah, and he's concerned for you mental health since you felt the need to hide it from him.   I think I actually felt my blood boil, she had no idea what she was saying nor did she stick up for me by telling him it was at her request I did it.  So you see she is a nasty fucking cunt.  Again I am sorry for the language, I can usually convey the message without resorting to the profanities.  Work really sucked today, I hate busy work and we just assembled catalogues most of today.  I also found out today from this Friday and all next week I will be stuck in the office while the boss is on vacation.  If it goes well though I may ask to move to a mostly inside position he and I talked about.  I would do the opposite I am doing right now, 1 day out, 4 days in.  Not to hide from anything, but to make it easier to work a second job.  I have concluded I need to take my bartender course asap,and start tending bar nights.  I have decided the first two things I will do with the money are a butterfly tattoo on my left calf, and a divorce for co.  I think it will help both of us move on if we can get past that hard point.  It will be the hardest thing I have ever done to divorce someone I still love, but hey that's my life. If I had been more honest with myself back when I was younger instead of a chicken shit asshole, I wouldn't have hurt her or me, can't turn back time though.  Any money after that will pad the funds a little bit more for surgery, who knows maybe I will enjoy bartending so much I might give up the day job shit.  I love to be Ms. social but I don't drink so this should be a cool job for me.  Hopefully I can find a nice GLBT bar to tend bar at, I would rather not to have to keep explaining to men they aren't my type that would hang out at a straight bar.  But hey I can blend into either place so I am sure I will have fun.

       Making it worth it...  I just came across this article this morning in yesterday's Courant.  urlLink Story  .  While I had to read it quickly from what I saw quickly is that gay acceptance is up in mainstream America.  While trans people and gay people aren't the same thing many in mainstream society treat us as such it is only within the communities the separation comes.  This new acceptance doesn't come from the gay community hiding, but being out.  This is exactly why I do what I do, and others like me do it too.  If we can educate the public even if just for awhile and to a limited audience it does spread.  I know first hand it is not easy, but I want to keep improving things if I can help.  The way things were back in the late eighties and early nineties had I continued my transition back then I probably would have been out on the streets due to non acceptance, and almost surely dead.  There still are places in this country where some young person is too scared to do this, because of fear of being out on the streets, or on the streets due to family and friend non-acceptance.  I am so thankful I was strong enough not to go there, but I also know I am strong enough to help make sure it is better for others.  I just hope I can keep it up long enough, and keep my dignity enough to make a positive difference instead of a negative one.  I really have to go, office day in lovely West Hartford, electrol tonight.  I will post again latter.  Love to all, take care.

       A tale of two sittings...  Interesting day full of really high highs, and rock bottom lows.  While getting ready this morning and not feeling like doing anything to my hair, but wanting to be ready for the cops if my asshole neighbor called them again, I decided on a bandanna for headware.  I laughed my ass off as I passed myself in my full length mirror and caught a quick glimpse of myself.  There staring back at me was the woman I wanted to be back in high school, one of those white suburban uppermiddle class border line lesbian types.  You know if you are in my age group, the kind of girls who would wear a little bit of makeup, a bandana like I had on or their hair pulled back with a headband.  Usually really into the Dead, Stevie Nicks, and Edie Brickell and her new Bohemains.  It took like 17 years, and I did not look like those teenage girls did, but I did look like they might if they never changed their look in all this time.  Its so cool to see less and less of Scott everyday and more of Ashley.  I love the fact that its not cool to walk around topless anymore since I have something to hide up top, I love the fact I have a waist and hips finally.  This is a tough learning process and finding yourself, its hard to decide what to do when you get to the place you wanted your whole life to be, but never really thought you'd ever get to.  This is why I am already starting to formulate agendas to pursue after surgery.  I always dreamed I would get there but never really thought I could do it, glad I was wrong.  This was my first official holiday en femme.  Mom's house was so fucking cool.  You guys may not understand but it was so nice to be helping out with the  women's work.   I had never been asked to pitch in before, but today it made me feel real.  I come from an old fashioned family and when holiday time comes the women are in the kitchen and the men talk current events on the couch.  While I won't get into the whole thing on how this is sexist and stuff, I actually liked being put to task into the womanly role.  It was like I was finally excepted as one of the women instead of one of the boys. Like I said it may sound arcane to you folks, but it meant the world to me.  I also got asked to say grace, which is cool.  Short thankful, sweet, and always ask for help for those less fortunate, because however bad I have it, somebody somewhere I am sure has it worse.  I found out my uncle who is really cool with this is cool with it because he had two friends who transitioned way back.  One transitioned back when my uncle was 18 so if my math is right that would make it 1973, not an easy time for trannys.  The second did it about 10 years latter and hung around until she got married, I doubt I will ever do that, even if gay marriage becomes legal.  We had a really cool religious discussion at dinner also.  My dads was so totally different.  My dad had over his long time girlfriend of over 20 years and some friends that are basically family.  My dad had just told his friends about me Thursday, so it hasn't had time to sink in yet.  I felt like the invisible woman.  Nobody said hi, I barely had two words said to me the whole time I was there.  Then my sister and her hubby shows up, ignoring me as usual.  I have given up on her, she is actually getting worse instead of better.  Her hugs have gotten more forced, her back is always turned to me, and she never makes eye contact.  It is so weird to hate the girl I so wanted to be like growing up.  She is a stuck up snob who hates who I am, and won't accept this anytime soon.  I am not telling her off like I want to, but I am also not bothering to try and contact her either.  Maybe someday down the road she will realize how she has hurt me by shutting me out, I hope I am big enough to forgive her.  I have really started to hate going over to my dads for any family shit, my dad supports me, kind of, but I cannot help but feel so shunned by everyone else in the click.  Oh well I just need to remember they are the ones who need to adjust not me, I just need to be me for me,and not worry about making the rest of the world happy, its not in my job description.  Overall it ended up being a tough day that I need to go recoup from so I can be back on track for another day.    Tomorrows another day, and I'm thirsty anyway, so bring on the rain..

       The day after thoughts on cops...   Ok forgive me, but I do have to make something perfectly clear to one of my most dedicated readers, my spouse Co.  Co I know this one might be a little weird for you to read, but this place is a place for me to be able to practice my writing skills about stuff that is important to me, and you are still a very important part of my life.  I was thinking about the whole incident yesterday with Meriden's finest, and I have come up with a whole new bright side to it.  Co and I both love each other very much, but we both know she cannot have a relationship with me the way I am now.  Knowing this hurts, but if it is what is best for her, then I wholeheartly support the decision and will do my best to help support her in it.  That being said, this has been a very difficult last 6 months on us, the last three especially.  We have lived separately since we sold our home back in October, but everyweeked we spend it together just like nothing is wrong, except for the whole new me stuff.   I know this has made it extremely hard on me to let go, and I am sure it has made it hard on her.  She has told me though since I started living as Ash it has gotten easier for her since I don't look the same anymore, I have not had the same luxury.  It was like I was working in a town far enough for me to have a separate house and the family got together for the weekends, like we were still happily married and were going to stay that way.  I equate it physiologically to an alcoholic just drinking on weekends, not a smart way to beat an addiction.  And yes my love for Co is like and addiction, I love her more than life itself, I love to be around her and still find her to be a very attractive woman, I just can't be the man she needs me to be.  I loved her coming over, as I love spending time with my kids, but I won't lie, I cried so hard when they left everyweekend, trying not to let them see the tears welling up as they left.  It was like sweet torture to be together like a family again where all was right in the world only to have it come crashing down when Sunday morning came back and reality set in.  I really never wanted it to stop, but it has too.  Co doesn't feel comfortable bringing the kids over if the downstairs neighbor is going to give me hell about it, and to a point she is right.  I will have to go out to her place for awhile and visit for the day, or meet her and the kids somewhere and just hang outside all day at a park or the beach, have a picnic, etc..  I don't feel comfortable enough to spend the night at her place with her brother in the upstairs apartment, I still care for him like he is my own family, but I really doubt this feeling goes both ways.  I broke his little sisters heart, and having a little sister myself I know how I would feel if her husband did this to her.  So we are at an impasse and a new time in our relationship.  I again won't get too much into it here, but we were sharing a bed at my house, that is now gone.  It hurts like hell to not have her sweet body laying next to me, I used to love to watch her sleep so peacefully, and I haven't slept in years.  I average about 5 hours tops on a good night, last night I fell asleep around midnight and was up at 4:30 and took up my knitting.  I loved just having her near me, it felt safe, it made it hurt a little less for awhile, but amplified it when she wasn't there.  I cannot speak for her, I don't know what effect that had on her, I just know that this whole incident has made me realize it is something we should have done before.  I want her to be happy, and find a new life, and somebody new to love who loves her, kinda hard to do when you're sleeping with your husband who's about to become a woman.  As for me, I am not really looking for love yet, I need to get to a place where I feel comfortable enough about myself before I put myself out there again.  I have issues to deal with on being a lesbian or a straight woman or something inbetween.  I am so attracted to women still, but I do find some men cute.  I have a real liking for FTM's too, most of them are really cute, and they aren't dickheads like most of the genetic men I know.  There is a certain comfortableness they have that attracts me also.  So many of us MTF's are failures in our lives, thats why we are transitioning.  We have failed as husbands for most of us, and a good amount are also fathers.  Now I haven't met a whole lot of FTM'S yet, but I have yet to meet one who tried to be more of a woman the way we all tried to be more of a man.  They were in touch with their gender issues and had the guts to do something about it.  Most FTM's start off as lesbians and then make the journey, and in the process they hurt allot less people.  Like I said it is their courage and their comfort that makes them attractive to me.  Better get going.  Love to all, take care.

       Out with the girls...    Twenty was cool, lots of interesting topics. A very nice, but very hurt SO came and shocked the room, we were all quiet for about two minutes until someone broke the silence. It is tough because most of us trannies already feel tremendous guilt for doing this. We feel selfish, or a failure for not being able to live as our birth sex, I personally feel both and many other bad feelings about this journey. This isn't all sunshine and lolipops, there is no victory in this journey, only a better level of comfort. The basic thing we get out of this is to quiet the screaming voice that is telling us we are the wrong sex, every other problem still remains, and new ones come too. We all seemed a little hesitant to talk too much about it, we didn't want to hurt her feelings and tell her this is how it has to be,but her spouse has a right to do what is right for her too. It truly is a really tough situation, and my heart goes out to both of them. I feel for both of their losses, and I gave them my e-mail & Co's e-mail so they could talk and share. It was a big step for her to come tonight, I told her at dinner she should be proud for being understanding enough to come for her spouse.   I volunteered to monitor and run the elections for twenty, nobody else looked willing to do it, so why not? I am new enough not to have preferences of one person over another, and I am too new to run for office myself, so it is a perfect job for me. I am actually honored that they agreed to let me do it, and I love to help out when I can. I am so new to this business of being out, and feel so helpless in offering help. This is a good way for me to pitch in a little. Maybe next time elections come up I will volunteer my services there. If nobody gets nominated for treasurer, maybe, just maybe I will place myself up for nomination for that position. I just feel too new to be an officer yet, I need to pay my dues, before I can collect them(insert snare drum, and symbol sounds here.)   I also went out with a group of the girls after twenty down to a cool Mexican place. I have never been out to a real Mexican place, never mind with a group of my peers. It was cool to hang around and just talk to my fellow trannies in a non support group setting. We have so much in common it isn't funny. I was the youngest one there, but my story goes like theirs almost verbatim except that thanks to their generation and their peers paving the way I have the courage to do it at a much younger age. I have benefited greatly from the hard work and sacrifices of those who went before me, they have paved a road for my generation. It is up to me and others like me to make sure that road stays in good shape, and even gets improvements if possible for those who come behind us. My dream is to someday not need groups like ours. A time where we understand gender enough, and are comfortable enough about it that we let our adolescents make that choice themselves. I doubt I or my children will ever see that day, but why should that stop me from trying to make it happen. I am sure my parents never thought man would land on the moon, but we did shortly before I was born. I am sure people like Rosa Parks never thought she would be able to ride on the front of the bus or eat with whites at a lunch counter, but today they do. Nothing is totally impossible to achieve in life as long as you try. Very little is possible in this life if you don't try. Ok enough of Ash on her soap box, I have some nomination notification emails to go write for twenty. Happy Easter to my Christian friends, and an even happier spring to my non Christian friends. Same goes for my enemies too.  Love to all, g'nite.

       The long arm of the law...  Had a change of plans and had Co and the kids come out to my place this weekend.  I don't want to get into too much, but I was afraid I'd wake up today with all 4 of my tires slashed.  Not all of Co's family are as understanding as she is.  And yes even I get scared sometimes.  Nothing though so far matches the fear I faced this morning when the cops were knocking on my door.  I was about to get in the shower, so I'm half naked, just finished shaving ,thank God, the parts of my face Suzanne hasn't finished yet.  So I asked Co to see who it was, she told me it was the cops.  Oh shit what the fuck do I do?   So I threw my hair on real quick, a bra, a half zipped sweat shirt and my yoga pants and went down to see what they wanted.  Turns out my neighbor below me called them for us making too much noise.  My kids aren't angels, they are 5 and 2, and like kids their age get a little antsy in an apartment.  The officer wanted my information so I invited him in and handed him my license, thank God I got the f on it.  I was so scared that he say a stray hair or that he could tell I was a tranny.  I never go out with at least my eyes done and some blush on, I was just plain this morning.  Makeup is my shield that protects me from being made, without it I am so easily clocked, with it I tend to blend.  I was also petrified that he was going to ask what my relationship to the kids were, I don't think he would have understood the whole  maddie  thing.  Luckily he didn't ask, Co was right there, so I couldn't say I was there mom, nor would I.  Maybe he did clock me, and figured it out for himself and didn't want to know.  They told me the downstairs neighbor was upset about the noise every weekend that has started since I recently moved in.  Hmm I've been here since October but only Ashley the last few months, they don't recognize me, cool.  Everything went fine, the cops left after I apologized.  After they left I broke down and cried, too much emotion from the whole experience left in me to do anything but.  Even though I was scared to death I sucked it up and did what I had to do to get by, and pass enough not to get harassed by the cops.  I know several Meriden cops from my old hockey days, I don't know how I would have handled it if it was one of them who came through my door.   Co and I have to figure out a new plan for visits.  I am not comfortable spending the night at her place, and I am afraid I will be evicted from my current place.  We live about 40 miles apart so it is going to be a tough one to figure out.  Maybe I can go over in the daytime to their place on weeks I don't do twenty, and have them over on the weeks I go, or when the weather is nice.  I am an outside person, so when its nice I'm outside, and outside there are no asshole neighbors to call the cops on you.  I hope those sons a bitches get some in return for doing this to me.  I am not sure if its the old crochety lady who keeps getting her paper stolen on her, or the younger man who has some interesting parties about once a month or two.  They tend to talk a little loud, and while I never touched the shit, I do recognize the sweet pungent smell of mary jane waifting from the apartment.  Next time I smell it I am calling the cops, fuck them.  Lets see them get away with a verbal warning for that shit, like I did today.  I am expecting that I will probably get a nasty little note from the property manager about the noise complaint, so I know this isn't over yet.  I will not allow myself to be walked over though just because I am a tranny, this tranny has fight left in her yet.     Love to all, take care, and if your going to twenty, I'm bringing pie.

       Taking a few days off...  Just a heads up, I will be gone from my blog for a few days during this busy weekend.  Friday night I will be closer to Co's house so I am staying the night there to be with the kids, and then going to twenty in the afternoon Saturday.  Sunday is Easter dinner with mom in the pm.  Co and the kids will meet up with me there for desert and we will pop over to dads after.  At least that will make up for our short Saturday.  The kids love to see there grandparents too.  Saturday will be too busy to post, Co has dial up that is so bad I can't even check my email from it. I'll try on Sunday, but if the weather is right Sunday am will include rollerblading.  If anyone needs me badly enough and you have my number, use it.  Have a good time, love to all.

       Back in the graces...  Another day of being received well by customers, a few shocked faces, a few hugs, and lots of  "good for you's!" I hope this feeling of acceptance lasts and doesn't fade away.  The absolutely most interesting thing happened today, I got asked for my phone number from a customer, one who I have know to be a man hating lesbian for awhile.  I had gone to see her since I figured she would hit me with all the  "you'll never be real"  line, which is correct in a way, but I never got it, and she insisted we should go hang out sometimes, so I said cool. As I was getting ready to leave, she said"how should I get a hold of you?"  I paused and for some reason gave her my personal number.  She was so nice today to me when I expected grief, and I can always stand to have more friends, I just hope she isn't expecting more right now. Love you all, take care.

       The big lawsuit...  Ok you have to fast forward to the blog about music and then come back up here to really get this one, sorry I meant to include it while on the subject of heavy metal.  While listening to a Mr. Ozzie Osbourne today, I heard the song "Suicide Solution", my memory hearkened back to how several parents sued the famous rockstar for being responsible for their children's suicides.  I won't get into who is more responsible for a child's well being, society or the parents, but it gave me an idea.  A really great idea.  So without further interruption I would like to annouce that I am suing the follow people for my transgendered status.  My mom- Hey it was her womb that I was in when this happened, maybe she had a little too much soy or other natural estogens that made me like this.  The electric company- for the added effects from the magnetic fields from their transition lines had on my mother while caring me.  Hostess-  I conclude that the twinkies my mother had cravings for while pregnant with me turned me this way, I suspect the cream filling.  The delivering doctor- For getting the sex wrong, come on do I look like a boy now, I see a big misdiagnosis malpractice suit here.  Glidden paints- For adding that yummy lead additive that I loved to eat and made me more trans.  Lewis Eaton- For hitting me in the nuts in little league the day I forgot my cup with a line drive shot while playing short stop, it sure made me stop wanting to have testicles any longer.  Ms. Armstrong- my pe teacher, for confusing me about gender with her mustache.  Twisted Sister- for glorifying cross dressing.  MTV- for promoting twisted sister.  My priest- for not molesting me, it made me feel like less of a man(ok I deserve flames for this one, but I did go thru a failed seduction by a religious counselor so be kind.)  All the girls at John F. Kennedy Jr. HS- for not going out with me, you pushed me over the edge.  That dick head goalie who cupped checked me back in 94-  I don't care cups only lessen the blow, they don't stop anything.  Oh damn I just realized that if I had not worn the cup that day, I would of at least gotten the orchiectomy out of the way that day, ok this one dropped.  Dow chemical- for inventing the spandex material in my sisters clothes that allowed me to fit in them even though I was bigger than she.  McDonald's-  The insect larvae casings they use in their hamburgers contain high amounts of phytoestrogens.  The writers of the comedy Soap- for informing me about SRS when Billy Crystals character backed out of his the night before, it gave me a goal to work towards with no map their.  Al Gore- for inventing the internet, on which I found tons of information on my destructive pursuit of changing my sex.  If you would like to donate to this cause and make it a class action suit, let me know, no donations are too small, and maybe we could add some more.

        Music and Mayhem...  Most of you don't know me personally very well, and some of you who have met me, have some pretty wrong feelings on me.  I guess I come across as reserved and quiet, I assure you nothing is further from the truth.  I have already blogged about my music tastes, and how eclectic it is, but lately I have been going back to my first love, heavy metal.  Yes kiss the devil in the mouth heavy metal.  I was such a metal head, Sabbath, Iron Maiden, solo Ozzie were so cool growing up.  Their songs about not fitting into society's mold, and self damnation were perfect for this ashamed young confused crossdresser.  I absolutely loved Sabbath and Ozzy more so, the lyrics and the song themes just fit so much to my life.  My absolute fav which I had to listen to today is the track "black Sabbath"(the chosen one), this is the tune which Ozzie sings about his finding out he is the chosen one, not the Messiah but the antichrist.  I so identified and still do with this one, I can't get over my feelings of being evil or deviant for being like this. I am still a recovering Catholic and probably will still approach the pearly gates(if I even get that close) with shame and wondering if I will be let in.  I can't see myself ever letting go of that, but even the fear of eternal damnation is not enough to stop me.  I may burn in hell, but at least I'm going there as the woman I was born to be.  I am sure I will run into a pope or two, like the Medici brothers while there.    I have found myself in this mood though lately for loud abrasive aggressive music, maybe part of my maleness is trying to fight back.  This is a learning process and a balancing act.  I cannot merely through away everything I was and just start a new life, that isn't how this works.  I will take lots of things from my maleness with me to my new life.  I am still a lover of sports, I have my music, and I still love women, so when I mix that with my new stuff, all is good.  I do have to be careful though now that the warmer weather is coming.  I am notorious for two things, riding with the windows down, and cranking to music and attempting to sing along.  I used to get such looks when I did this with Melissa, or ABBA( yes ABBA I'm eclectic remember).  Scott used to get many weird looks, but I am sure people just though I was a little light in the loafers.  I have no idea how me singing a limp biskit tune, or Ozzy will come across, I won't even try Rage against the machine, but I have to do it with Tool.  It will be very interesting to see indeed how this gets received. I am used to the looks from my old life, and now I am too mature to really care all that much.  I still love my female agnst music, I cranked Allanis Morrisete's first disc today while recovering from my early morning incident mentioned below.  This time of transition actually is a pretty cool time.  I equate it to spring cleaning the attic, I have stuff that I love that I will never through away,and some stuff that needs to go bye bye.  I then get to bring stuff downstairs and mix it up with the stuff I recently got to make it all work out.  It is such an honor to be able to reflect and prioritize all my stuff in my life,normally people don't do that until they reach middle age or even closer to death, I get to try and figure mine out in my mid 30's.  I hope I get it right.   Rock on and love to all you  children of the grave.

       Ok, so I am still human...  Bad day at work.  Got made for the first time today, not in a good way.  I was in a store I had not gotten far with in my last job, I'm looking around scoping things out, and as I approach the counter unseen where the three young twenty something girls are chatting I overhear their conversation "that's a man" "no it isn't" "why don't you go ask?"  "not me no way I don't talk to freaks."   I actually stopped dead in my tracks and felt my heart sink below my bowels, and fall out onto the floor where I kicked it halfway across the room like that geeky kid I was back in High School.  It really hit me so fucking hard.  My first gut reaction response was to walk up to the counter and offer to drop my pants so they could figure it out for themselves.  I really didn't want to end up in jail in Rhode Island, and more importantly I need the account.  Accounts equal money which equal surgery, so I bit my tongue, took a deep breath, did the normal reciting in my head of   confidence, poise, strength,  and walked right up to the counter unfazed and asked if the owner was in.  He wasn't so I left my stuff and strutted out of the store in my usual feminine way.  Strut it like you own the place, that's my motto.  I went out to my car, and just drove to my next town, music blaring, brain going, self doubt flourishing.  I went and treated myself to Taco Bell at lunch and felt a little better when nobody really took a second glance at me.  I drove down the street to my next account and I got cold feet.  I was so filled with self doubt at the time.  It took a few moments and then I decided to check over myself to see if I had anything blatantly wrong with me.  I spotted a single black hair on my chain at close range, but nobody could have spotted that 10 feet away.  I had my hair on straight no tag hanging out or anything.  I had my earrings in, my "security blanket" hoops, and all 3 rings.  I was good to go.  That was until something caught my eye, my shoes.  It was really no big deal I had my normal 2" sensible heals, but I had tan shoes on with black pants.  I highly doubt that this gave me away to them, but now that I knew about it, and I was already working with a hurt self esteem, I couldn't do it.  I laugh when I hear from somebody how well adjusted I am, especially when I have one of these moments.  If I am not fully 100% confident it shows, and fear is like blood in shark infested waters, it sends a message out, and I get chewed to bits.  Luckily I knew of a Payless and quickly found a nice pair of black flats and they were only $11.  I have spent too much money lately, I got Co allot of goodies for her birthday(she deserves more though), I treated myself to the latest Matrix DVD, I bought a shit load of Itunes music last week, and I just ordered more pills online(yes with a Dr.'s script, no more self medicating).  I put these babies on, thank God I am big, but not really big in the feel department.  I used to wear a size 10 mans boot, but now I fit easily into a woman's 9wide.  It is amazing how hormones and loosing 50 pounds can shrink your feet.  So me and my new flats went back to the store I chickened out on, strutted right in, and got back to work, I had been in here lots of times, they were so clueless to who I was, they even asked me how to pronounce my last name, they never asked Scott in 4 years, guess the new me makes a bigger impression.  I recouped and worked without being bothered the rest of the day.  I also shocked two more people, they didn't recognize me, but they were asking questions, I was too tired to lie about things, so I just whipped out my old card.  One gal had a weird look to her, but she asked me to come back so she could order some stuff.  The other one kept going without blinking, only said " hey that's cool" and went back to talking bis, I have to go back and see her next week.  I am finding most people are cool about this.  I am not going totally stealth, I couldn't do that in this business, I have too much of a reputation.   It is that good reputation that is getting me into places even though I have changed.  I know I am going to deal with some adversity, and I guess today was a good way to prepare for it.  How did those girls clock me, who knows, who cares?  Maybe one of them recognized me, or maybe it was my height with the heels?  Maybe, just maybe, they were just being the little stuck up snot nosed   Cee yoU Next Tuesday'S   (still too close to Co's b-day)that some girls are at that age.  They could have just poking fun at me for my non-traditional looks.  I have noticed this cattiness in young natal women when I have my confidence shining some get defensive.  I guess I missed the memo that only young beautiful women have the right to be confident about themselves to walk with poise and presence.  Us not so pretty people are supposed to slouch and trod aimlessly.  It took me quite awhile to get by this today, but when all is said and done  Fuck them for being the little idiots they are and, fuck me, for being so stupid enough to care for more than 30 seconds what they think of me.

       First Class...  Just watched the UCONN women win again, those girls are special.  What impressed me the most was the friendly embrace between Geno and Ms. Summit.  Patt just can't seem to beat UCONN when it counts yet she still shows class and dignity even in defeat. Yeah UCONN, and cudo's to Patt Summitt and the Lady Vols of Tennesee.  Now bring on the NHL playoffs, go Flyers, go Av's. And while I'm on it, bring on spring and my Yankees !

       Moved to tears of joy...  What another cool day at work, people say the nicest things sometimes.  I got nothing but lots of compliments and hugs today from my customers. I cannot begin to explain the joy I have found in knowing that my customers not only except me for me, but allot of them are actually embracing me for having the courage to be me.  I never imagined the positive response this has gotten me, and how I am selling more now then I did before.  It is cool to have this happy time in such a hard journey.  I won't go on and on about how hard this journey is go to Jude's site and read her take on it today, my words couldn't do justice to what she had to say on it, so I won't even try to.  Her link is on the left, under people I admire.  I did get some rough questions today.  My favorite nice question was  why would someone become a woman to stay with their wife (she used to do nails and knew someone who transitioned and stayed with her wife).  I kindly reminded her that gender does not always go hand in hand with sexual preference.  Gay men do not wish to be women, they just want to be with men.  Us MTF trannies want to be women, some want to be with men, others with women, others like me a little of both or somewhere inbetween.  I got a real nasty question from a usually nice fellow.  I of course can't fully convey his attitude in asking, but the question was  if I had the surgery yet so I could be with guys  .  I assure you his tone was like a how you doing type of tone, he was trying to find out if he was as interested and aroused as he thought he was.  He  really wouldn't have stood a chance anyway, I need to get laid, but even I have standards.  If I am going to end my hiatus and have anal sex with some guy, its not going to be with some guy who weighs 250lbs, 5'3" with greased back hair, more gold than Mr. T, and who is old enough to be my dad(in fact I graduated with this guys son from high school). Now if Ben Afflick calls and wants to do that to me, I'm there, otherwise I need to concentrate on reaching my goal of surgery so I can move on to the next goal and keep on going until I conquer the whole world.  Pizza with Co was cool, it felt weird to go back to place with so much history for me, in a role I never lived outside of a bedroom while Co worked and only for short spurts.  This is different, this isn't playtime or dressup any longer, this is the big show, real world, my life not just a hobby.  No more hiding in shame I wear my shame like a badge of honor now and preach to all who will pay me the favor of listening.  I also ran by my old house for a bit, twice. I am so fucking pissed off how they are treating my baby.  I worked my ass off making beautiful gardens, and yard out of nasty ugly woods, I even had two koi ponds with a waterfall and river connecting them that I dug myself, bit by bit.  I even dug a trench over 75' long with a pick to run the romex out there to provide juice to the pumps.  I poured lots of blood,sweat,and tears into that yard.  I drive by today and right in the middle of the side yard is a wrecked car. What the fuck, my old neighbors must be rip-shit right now.  I lived in a bluecollar neighborhood, but come on who the hell wants to see wrecked cars and parts strewn across a lawn where lush gardens once stood.  I will post a few pics of the hard work co and I put into that yard.  I shudder to think what they did to all the remodeling we did inside.  We did the whole kitchen over, including tile counter tops, new floors, lots of sponge painting, I even put in a closet or two and paneled a whole new bedroom.  Now when I say we and I, I mean we and I, not a carpenter or a tile guy.  I was the ultimate home improvement guru.  I have come along way in getting to the other end of the spectrum of classic gender related tasks in our society.  This area is where I am a total gender outlaw.  I don't believe we should give little girls cook sets, and boys trucks exclusively.  I believe we should listen more to our children and let them do what they feel more comfortable doing.  I am lucky I have found lots of stuff that is usually associated with either gender that I enjoy to do.  I am sure many manly men can cook, they just feel that it is not their role since that is what they learned.  It is time to change the lesson plan, and for people to do what they do best regardless of gender, and just deal with it.  I think it is awful to box anyone in to any stereotypical roles for anything.  Auditions for the play went well, I think. The only problem was I showed up at 7 left around 8 and nobody else showed up, just me and the two great people running the auditions.  I was very nervous at first and picked an easy monologue to read.  It revolved about being found to have a little extra anatomy by a straight man while making out in the back of a car.  I related quickly to it since this is one of my biggest fears and one of many reasons for staying inactive for now.  It took me over 20 minutes to get all I wanted to do it, the gestures, the tone, the pauses and enuciations.  I don't think I pulled it off totally clean, but it felt so right.  They liked me enough to read a second from a 51 year old woman who has surgery the night before her birthday to wake up to her new vagina on her birthday.  This too was a cool one.  My favorite line was about being 51 years old and having a 1 day old vagina.  I identified with this one too, since even though there was an age difference this woman wrote her experiences how I imagine I will feel when my turn comes.  I also got to read a kind of fun, mc type of piece about the bathroom, I did it poorly, but it was a first try.  The most fun I had all night though was doing one from a FTM about his options for a penis.  While reading it and preparing I felt myself slipping into this persons head.  It took me a second, but I soon found my new refined straight posture gone, my old male posture returned along with my legs spread open the way I used to sit as a guy.  I even performed it in my old male voice, not a huge stretch for me, since I am so new into my RLT, but OMG it was fun.  I hope I get selected to do this play, I hope there is enough interest.  I would love to do these, many of them read like some of my blogs, only interesting.  It is cool to be able to slip into their lives and live little snippets of their experiences without having to stay long.  I equate it to going on vacation, or going to an exotic buffet, lots of choices but not normal fare.  I will let you guys know how it goes.  I feel bad that nobody else could show up, if you guys showed interest before but somehow forgot or something get in contact with Toby so this can happen.  I won't post in the am, I have to truck out to Rhode Island and then I have electrol in the evening so I have to hustle tomorrow.  I am down to an hour once a week now, half choice, half economics.  But I will enjoy only having to deal with the discomfort for only half the time.  No offense Suzanne.  Take care, love to all, be good.

       Long day ahead...  Back on the road today, back calling on stores.  It should be interesting today, I am still waiting for some bad words about this, and I will most likely find them today.  I am going to see some folks who are how shall we say "culturally challenged" you know Rednecks, my old people.  I lived amongst these people for years and years, I learned to love country music by my immersion in it, or is the word tortured.  I wore the uniform of flannel, denim, and the oversized belt buckle.  I still feel ties to country style living, just not its closed mindedness.  These people are not going to accept the new me, these people asked if I wanted to use the ladies room after I got my ears pierced last spring.  These people call folks like my brother deviants and living against God. I am sure these folks think like my inlaws did until recently that I was just gay.  I am not just gay, NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT.  But I am more, much more, I am a transsexual bi with lesbian preferences, but I doubt they would ever get that whole thing.  It should be interesting.   I am also going to the nastiest little bitch this side of Hades.  She has hated my guts ever since the rumor spread about her boob job, she blamed me.  I may have told a person or two, but only those who knew even more damaging stuff about her.  I have always fantasized about telling this woman off, now I feel past that and a little braver and not as guarded.  This woman was and still is the kind of woman who used to use her surgically enhanced cleavage and her sexuality to try and distract men.  I never had the heart to tell her I wasn't as effected as other men.  Don't get me wrong she is gorgeous, and if I was into just cheap meaningless sex, she would be great, but her inside ugliness makes the outside nasty and unattractive.  I also am going to have pizza with Co and the kids tonight to celebrate her birthday.   It should be interesting, I haven't been to their house since I started fulltime RLT.  This is the house where my daughter was conceived, it is the house where I confessed my crossdressing to Co, it has lots of memories in it.  It also houses Co's brother in the upstairs apartment, the same brother who has a history of getting a little carried away sometimes, and who just recently found out about the whole Ashley thing, he too thought I was gay.  I hope it all goes well, and on the way if I have time I am going to swing past my old house up the road.  I haven't been able to go by the street, never mind the house since we sold it last fall, too many memories, but time heals all wounds.    After supper I am heading to Hartford for auditions for the gender monologues, a play about gender not in the binary, and transgender stuff.  I haven't seen the script yet, but I saw sample monologues, I hope the finished product is better.  I am no prude, but certain words loose their effectiveness when overused.  Believe me I still throw them around, I actually think I call other women that nasty C word that Co hates enough for me not to use it on her birthday, than when I was a man.  I still have to go to see what this is all about, some of you think I am some kind of Martha Stewart(JUDE) but there is allot more to me than my blanket, my cooking, and such.  Time to show my racy raunchy side a bit.  I love being well rounded, and I have always wanted to try and act on stage.  It should be easier than all the acting I was forced to do to survive and blend in my old male life.  But hey there are worse things to be called, Ms. Stewart is a very strong woman who has gone after and gotten what she has wanted, she is my uber-bitch hero.  I wish I could be as strong as she is.    I will fill all of you in on the boring details when I get back, while I am watching UCONN beat up on Tennessee.  I love the strength these young women have, and to be blunt some of them I find gorgeous, too young for me,and most likely straight, but still gorgeous.  Love to all take care.

       Happy birthday Co...  Today is my best friend in the world Co's 31st birthday.  Hey babe we might not be a couple anymore, but you always have a place in my heart.  I wish I could have been more of a man for you, but more importantly I hope fate shines favorably upon you and brings you a real man.  And when you meet Mr. Wonderful, see if he has a sister.  You deserve more than life has given you, I hope soon you will start the upturn you so truly deserve.

       Hurt self esteem...  It is cool that I have gotten so many nice comments about how I seem to fit as a woman.  I love the fact I am not alone in feeling this is the right thing.  I do have two interesting problems though with some of the compliments I have gotten.  The first one involves people saying how I look like I fit now, and how good I look.  Some people have gone overboard and told me how awful I looked as a man.  I've been described as a man with words like awkward and homely.  Wow I was ugly before, but now I look good.   How the hell do I know you are telling the truth now?  How do I know I am not still ugly, and you are still trying to be nice to me by telling me how nice I look now?  I know I looked kind of weird as a guy, that's why I shared the pics with you guys.  Eventually when I feel more comfortable I will share pictures of the new me.  I hated how I looked before, I had people staring at me all the time before starting my RLT, now I fit, rarely will anyone take a second glance at me like I don't fit in, which is cool.   The second problem I have is how gay men tell me with more enthusiasm than most about my looks.  Ok, not a great self esteem builder.  What even makes it better is when you combine the two.  I have been told several times by gay men that I was unattractive as a man, yet I look hot as a woman.  OK, BACK UP THE BUS.  YOU LIKE MEN,WHEN I WAS A MAN I WAS UGLY TO YOU. NOW THAT I AM A WOMAN I AM ATTRACTIVE.  I thought I was trying to figure out my own sexuality, and you guys are just confusing me more.  The best comment came from my brothers boyfriend who I love to death.  When I was just starting my RLT I sent my brother and his boyfriend a picture of me en femme.  I was on the phone with my brother when he yells" hey Shawn tell your brother he makes a hot woman."  Why can't someone who actually might be interested in a relationship find me attractive?  Well I should look at the bright side, they are compliments , and I could always be a fag hag. Love you all, take care.

       Weekly Rant...  Ok I talk so much about myself, funny it is my site, I do have to spend at least once a week ranting on stuff that effects community.    This weeks rant comes from an article I read from the Associated Press about how both sides are gearing up for the battle over gay marriage debate.  I get such a kick out of the religious rights reason.  I am too young to have lived through the whole civil rights battles of the sixties, but I wonder if the people against granting civil rights back then were just as stupid as they are today.  My favorite quote came from a Michael Carl president of the Heritage alliance.  Mr Carl says(from under his white little pointy hood)  "The issue of marriage is too fundamental to the cultural makeup to leave it to those who want to redefine it for their own reasons."    Well, Mr Carl.  I have a few important questions.  Firstly isn't culture driven by the majority, not a vocal few, and honey most people don't care if two people who love each other get married to each other, even if they are the same sex.  I don't get why you and others like you feel the need to force your morality on the rest of us.  None of us asked for you or anyone else like you to save us.  I have a feeling when my days are done, and I go before God, who I loved is not going to be as important as how I lived my life honestly, and how I treated others.  If you think God hates love of any kind you have big problems.  Secondly Mr. Carl, if someone should control culture for the people,who the fuck elected you.  Your fellow Klansmen may like you hun, but most of society got fed up with folks like you a long time ago.  You religious right folks have scared so many people like myself away from organized religion.  Why is it that church attendance has been at an all time low recently,Satan? No, Satan's got his feet up on the couch rooting for the Red Socks while "God's People" such as yourself do his bidding.  Mr. Carl, I think you should be true to yourself, stop hiding your homosexuality and be you.  I assure you God won't hate you, and if I am wrong, hey at least you'll have allot of company in Hell.

       I love being a girl...  Since I am on a self imposed hiatus from the carnal, I have had to find other ways to please my senses.  Tonight I indulged in the joys of a nice warm bath.  Bath beads, and salt, scented candles, bath pillow.  Oh my God it was an awesome experience, to just be laying in that nice warm bliss surrounded by the flicker soft light while swimming in the aroma of Yankee candles.  Wow I really do need to get laid, huh?  I will know that I have achieved stardom and success once I am able to get a custom made tub long enough for me to lay down and be totally immersed neck to toe.

       A day spent on me...   I'm so vain I do think that song is about me.  Today was a sharing and a day of vanity.  I met this cool young gal named Tasha who  is doing a photo project on transgender issues and people perceptions of gender.  I had no job when I signed up and I was and am still bored, so I volunteered.  It was a cool experience and I learned some stuff, like a new term  pansexual- being attracted to all genders, not just the classic binary two.   That is a cool word, and an even cooler concept, it may describe my own preference, even though I definitely lean towards the female end of that scale.  I really don't care though as much about a person's look or their gender or even age as much as I do their personality.  I love a beautiful soul, no matter what shell it is traveling in at the moment.  It doesn't matter if I am just looking for friendship or love I tend to be attracted to people with beautiful souls.    So anyway, we did some cool pictures, did some outside in the rain, it was cold, but I still had fun.  It was really nice to talk to someone younger than my usual circle and share my ideas and my view on this journey.  I of course got a little preachy on how us(as a group) are usually on the front lines as far as prejudice and persecution since many of us are very easy to spot than most gay people. I am not saying gay people do not get discriminated against, I got called faggot myself many times for being an effeminate leaning man, but a 200lb person with a huge brow, huge hands and feet and a deep voice are going to stick out more than a skinny boy any day.  We sometimes bear the brunt of things from the ignorant morality crowd.  I really don't care about what those people think, and even though I am lucky enough to blend most of the time, I would be doing this regardless.  I have before and still do face ridicule from people even though I blend.  My own family has members who have been nasty enough that if I still was as big as I used to be I would have asked to step outside.  I have had friends just take off when I told them, or the first time they saw the new me.  I have been shunned by my old pastor, who didn't even have the decency to write me back,he just took me off his mailing list and now just send things to Co.  I don't always blend either.  There are people, the awake people, as I like to call them who notice.  Most people in this life are just sleep walking, not really awake and paying attention to all that is going on around them, they are distracted by the pretty stuff too much to see the little things, or the important stuff.  Then there are the awake people, which I include myself in, people who notice the little things in life, and can see the big picture, and how everything is not how it appears to be.  These people may notice my adams apple, or my brow, or how unreal my hair looks on a bad wig day.  They notice my voice, and other things, I see it in their eyes that they are on to me, and I say back with my eyes that I noticed.  I hope you guys don't think I am insane by my observations, I just get these feelings or reads on people.  It is what has made me a successful salesperson.  It is not hard to read body language, or subtle messages in peoples conversations once you learn the signs.  Anyway, I am doing it again.  I talked so much about me today, I need to give it a break and get back to real world.  I have an office day on Monday, tryouts for the play are on Tuesday, electrol wed night, and twenty on sat.  Not to mention Easter is this coming Sunday.  I also have to decide on if I am going to go to the trade show in Atlantic City in two weeks.  It will be a great way to network in my old industry and let allot of people know I am back in a short amount of time.  Unfortunately I work for a small company who doesn't have the extra capital to put up so I can go network, and I need to see how my funds are.  Money is always tight, and I need to watch it and stay on budget if I want to get surgery next year.  I will have to figure it out.  I also wrote a poem today while having lots of pictures taken of me in the rain.  It is my usual hybrid style of half sad, half positive.  I hope it doesn't bore you, that is if the first part hasn't already made you sleepy.    Rain..   Drip by drip, Drop by drop. This deluge from heaven, Darkens my heart, Yet cleanses my troubled soul, And carries my sorrows away.  Each perfectly blended droplet, of Hydrogen & Oxygen Has an effect  Greater than the sum of its parts. Neither one on its own Could ever make me  So sad, Yet so happy. Rain both takes life, and renews it.  Rain, Cold and dreary. Fogs up my soul, Weighs on my heart. It builds headwaters, That over time Will turn into tears And in turn cleanse my soul, And carry my troubles away, Like a river rolling towards the sea.  Rain cleanses as it clogs. Rain brings new life, As it washes away, OLD, LIFELESS things. Renewing As it  Reaps. Carrying away  Troubles  and  Worries From  Days of yore. While planting seeds For  tomorrow.

       Walking on sunshine...  Wow day two of being back on the road was another rewarding day.  Many compliments about bravery bullshit, and good for you's mixed in.  It was also nice to write some business too.  I was blown away for the second day by someone who was so nasty to me in my old job, that was praising to me now.  They hated me so much working for my last employer they threw me out of their store, yesterday they told me I had  allot of balls  to do this like this.  Unfortunately I don't want my balls, that's the whole point of this journey.  Got my first round of really tough and inappropriate questions, but I think at least she did not mean to hurt me by them, it is just her personality. I got hit with such important educated questions like  so you got real boobies yet?  Are you a real woman down below yet or are you still a man? My gut was to respond to both   hun there's only one way to find out, and it too cold to strip in here.   I kindly changed the subject though.  She then saw my uncomfort and asked if anyone else was asking, I told her yes but not so bluntly.  She was cool, and said it looked like a fit for me.  I am noticing a theme from folks that I seem to fit as Ashley.  Maybe my uncomfortableness as Scott was more apparent than I let on.  Yet everyone has told me they were shocked when they initially heard the gossip.  About half of them though saw the signs after looking back at the changes in me the last 2 years, the weight loss, the teeth fixed, contacts, hair growth etc...  I hope I will continue to meet such good feelings towards my journey.  I do know some will be not accepting, but I will have to deal with them as they come.  I am also expecting the slide to come.  My life has historically been filled with really big ups   like this current time , usually followed by downward trends of bad luck.  I am not enjoying my up time any less, but I am bracing myself for any down turns that may come.  With every life some rain will fall, that's why it is life.  I am just so thankful I have been blessed with so many ups in my lifetime, especially these last few years.  Today we are going to try to take the kids to see Scooby again at the movies, and then they go home early tomorrow so Co's folks can take her out for her B-day lunch.  I am also getting together with the gal from PFLAG for my photo shoot tomorrow morning, I am nervous as all hell.  I haven't had many people over my apartment at all, never mind someone I don't know.  Add to that my never being one about looks now posing for photos, hey it was my decision time to follow thru.  For some reason when I saw this project I felt I should offer to do it, don't have any clue why, but we only get one life you might as well try different stuff.  I will let you guys know   if anybody is still here   how it goes for my one day as a model.  Love you all , be good, take care.

       R-E-S-P-E-C-T...  Holy crap did it feel great to get back on the road.  I was almost moved to tears by the kind words of several of my customers.  It was so cool to be to find out I was right, most people don't care what I do in my own life, as long as I service them well. I had most of my customers not even talk about my transition, it was the principal skinner scenario I was hoping for.  A few said they heard thru the grapevine and they didn't care, and after less than a minute we were talking like we did in days of yore.  A couple actually almost moved me to tears with their kind words about my courage and boldness in living my life the way I had too.  They told me to be proud for making a stand and making history, they claim I have made an impact on the whole industry, wow.  I told them thank you, and then told them I am simply doing what I need to do to survive, you don't congratulate someone for breathing, I am merely breathing.  I had to do this to survive, it is not that big of deal.  It is not an easy task, but it is one I HAVE to do, just as someday I will have to die, its just that simple for me.  I don't know if it is my mindset, my drive, or if I am as well adjusted as I am told.  I don't feel any of those things, I am just doing what I have to do.    The best comment of the day came from my first visit.  I have known this customer for over 4 years and actually got a dog from him, unfortunately we had to place the dog after she bit my little girl.  So I went in to see Ray, and he did not recognize me at all.  I gave him my card he looked at my last name and said  "L*? Are you related to Scott, the guy who used to work for g*?"  I replied with a smirk"sort of."  He went on to say how much he missed Scott and was sad to see him go. He then got to the best part he says," sort of related, huh. What are you his ex-wife?  I just smirked at him, dyeing inside.   I didn't say a word and just kept going, and Ray dropped the subject.  I really think he thought I was my own ex-wife.  I wonder how the state of Massachusetts looks at same self marriage.  How would that go?  Do you, take yourself to have and hold till death do you part?  I laughed at this one all day, and will remember it until I draw life's last breath.  I did not have the heart to tell Ray who I am, I didn't lie to him and say I was something I was not, I just didn't correct him.  I hope it doesn't come back to bite me in my fat ass latter on, but if he didn't know about me, or believe the gossip, why shock him now?  He will find out sooner or latter, probably feel a little embarrassed for not knowing it was me, and move on, I hope.    Whether or not I am successful in this job, I will always remember this day, and the adventures I had.  I haven't had a day this enjoyable at work in well over a year.  The last year at my old job was filled with turmoil, so it became a bad time for me, still enjoyable, but not as good as it could of been.  Today I got that old feeling again of guiltiness for enjoying work too much. I felt 10 feet tall today.  Well actually with my heels I was close to 6.  This is my calling for some reason, not the noblest profession, but it is a fit.  I just have the right personality to sell, I am compassionate, an honest person, and a soft seller.  These things have earned me respect, pair that up with a great product and you can sell without selling your soul.  I know most people have a very negative feeling of sales people, not all of us are sharks, and that is why I knew I could succeed in my old field.  I remember hearing "that if life made you a streetsweeper, be the best damn streetsweeper you can be."  I am being the best salesperson I can be, and being happy doing it.  I still plan on writing my books, but that is my second career, or side job.  I am one of those weirdo's who plans on never retiring, I will most likely do some sort of work until I die, it is just me.  Speaking of work I need to go prepare for tomorrow, and work on my blanket some more.  Last night was a little surreal. I was listening to Gender Talk on-line, watching hockey with the sound off, while knitting my blanket.  Almost as surreal as the day I was looking up quotes in the Bible to combat my born again cousins while listening to Zappa.  I truly do some weird shit sometimes, but something about the "muffin man" adds to the whole experience of looking through the joy's of Leviticus.  Oh just an additional thought about my post this morning on the pharmacist who denied birth control.  What would she do if someone came in for HIV medication?  Would she be able to fight her morality and give someone medicine for a disease that is wrongly solely associated with homosexuals and drug users?  I am working on a letter to send to the pharmacy to speak my mind on the subject. It probably won't make a lick of difference, but I have to try. Love to all, G'nite.

       The irony of morality...  Wow a rhyming title, but a scary one. This country has become overly polorised lately on the religious front.  So many groups seem to be using religion to push their own morality or squash what they see as immoral.  It is quite a shame, people like myself who believe in God are forced away from a church type community due to these zealots who make religion such an awful thing.  I am a very spiritual person, I love God, I try to be good and serve God by being a good person, not of fear of hell(used to be) but out of making things better.  I cannot bring myself to going to a church though, I have looked to the Bible, and all I find is confusion and contradiction.  It has gone to far.  I saw this story on the morning news and I went and found the link   urlLink story  .  It sickens and worries me at the same time that someone can use their morality in caring for someone's health.  Basically a pharmacist in Texas denied birth control pills to a customer with a prescription for them just because she(the pharmacist) did not believe in birth control.  I wonder what Ms. Wonderful would think of filling my prescriptions !  While I don't live in Texas, and I will be surprised that CVS doesn't fire her, if she is not reprimanded it could start a nasty trend.  Just like the trend our president is keeping alive of bringing religious morality into government.  I am ashamed that I voted for him, he spoke of so many good things, he had a good plan, lies, all lies.  Of course when your other choice has the personality of a tree you usually will win.  I cannot vote for W this go around, he has moved way too far to the right, he has lied too many times for my comfort, and he is turning this country into a hot bed of religious turmoil.  We are starting to head down a road of big splits in this country, we need to be careful that we remember how much we all have in this great country.  In other countries people like me would have been disposed of long ago. In many countries if I even had access to a computer, a message like this one would lead to my torture or execution.  We do indeed live in the most free, and one of the best countries in the world, instead of trying to change everything, we should just fix the important stuff.  The constitution got us a very long way without many amendments hopefully it won't become a piece of toilet tissue by being fluidly changeable.    Enough preaching I have some pet treats and toys to go sell.  Love you all, take care.

       Back and kicking...  Ok folks I'm out of the hospital for now, and hopefully won't ever be going back for those reasons.  I will share lots when I get a free moment, right now I'm trying to get things ready to move this Sunday to moms, and I am staying there tonight and other nights.  This place has too many bad memories of a really hard fall.  I don't know if I will ever truly recover from it, but I know I am stronger from it.  I hope to be back bitching and whining sometime this weekend or early next week.  I thank you for all your thoughts and prayers, and I look forward to getting back to keeping you all up to date, let me assure you allot happened on my end, and I am sure lots happened on all your end too.  Love to all, take care.  Hope you find one thing good today and just fucking enjoy it.

       Out but still on break...  Ok guys, I'm out it was one of the scariest things this gal has ever been through.  I promise you I will share the experience one day on my blog or at least in my book.  I do need to take a break from the computer for a bit though ok.  I just need to focus a little more on the inside, get my house in order a bit more before coming back.  I also need to get packed, moving in with mom next weekend,hastily try to get shit together, and get some manual labor to help.  In the words of that idiot they elected in California   I'll be back...   Love to all, take care, miss you all.

       Mental break...  it is sad to report that the effects of recent events is making me go talk to somebody about things.  I am taking a little mental break. Don't know how long I will be gone.  I don't think it is full breakdown but I need to really talk to a professional that can help me.  I will write about it after I get out,and I will get out.  I I'm sure co will leave her email on the comments so as you can get an update.  I love you all and thank you for you love and concern.    Sorry for being so good at helping others but so bad at my own fucking shit.

       Dark dilemma...  Ok before I get too dark and full of despair let me first say I had the pleasure of talking to a really nice man for over an hour and twenty minutes this morning who is a friend of JR's when the "J" was in the middle not the first initail.  D is a really nice guy who is trying to turn his love of animals into a thriving business.  We talked at length about the market place up here, pet nutrition and of course just a little about JR or MJ depending on who was talking.  It is nice to find somebody who is from the outside world talk so highly of someone in ours.  It was a nice change to meet a stranger who was cool with things and focused on the sensational stories we hear so often, and the hate and misunderstanding so many have of us.  We even talked about the future and discussed briefly me working for him at somepoint down the road, I'm open for just about anything, I know it won't be for a bit, but as you are about to read things have exploded again at work, but once again not about my t issues.  Here is where the dilemma comes in, I took my job to help people. We give schooling to those on the brink of going under and train them and help them get job in a lucrative field.  Or at least that was the line of shit they fed me.  I found out today our placement isn't all its cracked up to be, we don't have more jobs than graduates, not everybody gets a job right away.  We do provide training and they are highly capable of landing a bartending job when they come out, we just are not providing as much help as promised.  This is where the dilemma comes in, believe it or not I am a sales gal with a conscience, that is how I can be so high pressure and live with myself and look in the mirror at night.  Knowing that we aren't all we claim to be is tough for me to handle.  I don't know how much pressure I can place on something I consider to be a scam of sorts.  I am trapped though right now, I cannot quit my job and wait to fight for unemployment, and I am strict commissions so if I don't sell I starve, and so do my kids.  I really don't care if I waste away to nothing but the thought of my kids going without is enough to make me think about ending it all.  I won't lie to you guys, I thought about it tonight on my way home.  Me, Ms. stronger than steel, Ms. great attitude, Ms. go ahead piss on me world I can take it, was actually thinking of just going the wrong way down 84.  Of course I can't do that, I am too full of myself to do such a thing, but it scares me to look off the edge and look down.  I have done it before and it is always the same feeling of such helplessness, like a sweet siren's song is calling me over, but my strength and my love of life and that of my family and friends keeps me going, thanks to allof you.  I do need to do something though, I cannot scam folks out of there last several hundred bucks on an empty dream.  Unfortunately I am forced to do so for the time being though.  I wish I didn't have too, but it is just a fact of life, I hope the universe forgives me but I can't let my kids starve. I wish I never had the conversation I had today at work where I learned the truth.  Tomorrow I have to let my friend Suzanne know I can't come anymore for now, I can't be getting electrol for at least awhile.  I am sending off my resume to a few places over the next few days, and will work at the present job as long as I can hold on.     I hate to sound so down when I am usually up, and I AM NOT LOOKING FOR: SYMPATHY,PITY, CHARITY, OR ANYTHING ELSE.   I think it is important for everyone who has become involved in my life as friends or just casual observers that even the strong have moments of weakness, even the "easiest" of transitions are filled with many hardships. Yes I have done well, and better then allot of folks, but I am still a trans person in a society that has marginalised me to a place where I am stuck having to face dilemma's like the one I am in. I was turned down for many of the good jobs when that M that is attached to my SS # popped up, and forced to take jobs I would rather not take. I am close to being totally out of funds when before I leftthe male world I was within a few thousand of surgery.  It amazes me how fast it went, but with no income, paying fully for insurance, and all the other bills coming in it didn't take long at all to go through.  I don't know what else I will loose in my journey, but I also know it won't be the last thing either. Still I trod on.  My good friend Peg from my Boston job called me tonight again, and we got to talking she gave me this great quote that I have to share with everyone.  Tough times never last,  but tough people do.  I don't know who originally said it,but it was told to her by a kindly little old lady she once worked with who had a really hard life.  I hope you find the same inspiration in it that I took out of it.  I hope you guys know I am fine, not happy, but not going into oncoming traffic yet either.  If I was I wouldn't burden you all with the details, that would not be fair to you guys.    I wish you all a goodnight, love, peace, and a better day for all, including me.

       Short writing day...  I don't have much time this morning I've been answering emails and taking phone calls all about the old rep thing.  I also have a phone appointment @ 9am to help out a friend of a friend who is looking to break into the area with a new product line.  Any friend of JR's is a friend of mine, scary thought as that is .:>  I also got a call from mom this am while I was on the exercise bike, she wanted to know how it went with my cousin.  I told her, and she told me how proud she was of me for standing up to him, and how she hates how he and others in the family are trying to use religion to change my mind.  Mom really understands me, that is an awesome feeling to have.  Tonight I have been invited on a little shopping field trip w/cos.  I don't know if I will go or not, all depends on my day.  I really do want to go, even though I really don't want to be showing my true hairline to everyone in the world.  A girl like me has her reputation to uphold, you know that of a prissy snob.  I love to poke fun at myself more than anyone else in the world so forgive me.  I think it will be good to go, need to work on the courage a little more.  I really don't think walking into a customers place as the opposite sex that I used to be was all that brave, showing what you look like underneath the big "mask" I have, that takes courage.  Maybe I am stuck up, I don't care allot about others looks, but like myself to look just right.  What's going to happen as I age?  I already noticed some wrinkles by my eyes due to the change in fat there, and my weight loss. I think they are cool though, they make me real, not perfect, and make me feel a little more aged and wise.  I get lots of lip over my age, and it is nice to feel my age every once in a while, and not feel like the little kid I sometimes get treated as.  Oh well, gotta go put my face on.  I will let you all know how it all goes.  Love to all, take care.

       Glass houses..  I wasn't blogging I think when I left my long term pet food job, so there are some stories allot of you don't know from my coming out process there.  Well one of the reps I used to work with that represents Triumph pet foods(I am naming names on this one) was particularly nasty.  She had gotten her hands on a leaked photo of me en femme, with my kids and distributed it heavily, she also told me I would have done my kids better if I had just gone and killed myself, or gone far away so I wouldn't mess them up.  She claimed that me being in my kids lives would turn them gay and just plain screw them up. She also told me I was immoral, and a deviant. We debated for a bit, and I assured her that I talked at length with my shrink and that they said better to have an odd parent then to lose a parent totally.  She also told me I would be responsible for certain brands dropping my company if I were to stay, and I am sure she was among the vocal few that petitioned my boss to send me packing.  After all this I actually thanked her for her honesty and told her "you must care for me allot to have the courage to tell me how you really feel, thank you for caring."  She was speechless, and we never spoke again.  Ok fast forward to the future.  I get a call today from an old friend in the industry.  Turns out my little friend who was so quick to judge my morals was just found to be sleeping with a customer who is a married man and has kids.  I feel so bad for the wife, she was a good customer, and she is nowhere to be found right now, I have a feeling she did herself in.  I cannot imagine the loss and the hurt after 27 years of marriage.  I find it amazing that a person who was calling me immoral just back in January is wrecking homes, and sleeping with married men.  Its funny how so many folks only apply their morals to others and not themselves.  This rep has a history of doing this in the past, oh yeah, plus she got fired from one dog food company for biting somebody.  I don't know too many folks in their 40's that bite other people as a way of fighting.  Ok maybe a little nibble in bed, but not a full out bite.  I guess SB should have checked out her own house before throwing stones.  These are a little out of order so G'nite and love to all.

       Made..  One of the students mentioned to the instructor last night that he is gay, and then had second thoughts saying he shouldn't have mentioned it.  The instructor and the director explained we are GLBT friendly, and all the employees at our school are gay.  He asked" even the tall blonde lady?" They told him I was a lesbian.  His friend who is taking the class with him,and is not gay, piped in "oh I thought she was a drag queen."  OMG my spirit was crushed for a bit.  When they told me today,and I checked her out, all I could do is think back to 3rd grade and "it takes one to know one."  Little girl is a little manly looking, and if I walked out of my house with hair like that, a hawk would be snatching it off my head.  I know I am a catty little bitch...  I am not a drag queen but I have friends that are.  I am a little sensitive when folks try to group us all together, much like ome group all Asian folks together.  I hate more when the use the term in a bad light, like I said I have some friends that consider them selves DQ's and I don't like it when somebody picks on my friends.

       Day 2...  Well lots of different stuff happening even after the events of this am.  Overall work was good, but no-where as busy as yesterday, it better pick back up soon, or I'm splittsville.  I have no trouble closing the deal, but nobody is coming in or calling right now, so its hard to close what you don't present.  I'm on track still to have a good week, I'm just about on the goal I set for the school this week, but I need more than that to get back on track.  At least I have an opportunity right now.  I have an online friend from one of my boards that got dicked around and forced out of her job after she came out.  She is also in sales and had the same experience I had, customers were cool with it, management wasn't.  I fail to see why folks can't just let others be themselves and let us make both involved some money.  Trannies seem to have an extra drive and determination that allot of normal folks lack.

       It is good to know the Good Book...   I was trying to duck my cousin and not go talk to him today, until I realized that I've done my share of hiding from problems for 2 lifetimes, so I called him.  We had a nice chat, he thought he was going to be more schooled on scripture than I, not.  I impressed him with my knowledge and my calm explanations of things written and how to take them.  He doesn't believe this is real, but is very impressed with my spirituality and comfortableness with God.  It was a nice civil conversation, I got him in a bad corner that he weaseled out of when it came to the fact the bible forbids menstruating women to attend church.  He replied "well that part of the bible is just old cultural laws that don't apply."  He walked into the trap, I informed him that was the same section that forbids homosexuality.  He got me good with the fact it speaks out against it in Romans also.  Neither of us won, we weren't even fighting.  I hope he has a little better understanding of me now, and accept me, and others like me. He did think it was a sin to alter what God has made, I informed him that God made me to be trans. I also had the argument about Siamese twins or kids born with holes in their hearts, but he doesn't understand this is a real condition. He still thinks you can be made this way by evil spirits and all you homos that I hang out with.  I don't know if I got through to him or not, but I tried, and I will continue to try.  He is my blood relation, and he is very into God.  I do think he may be a key link in reaching many others in that whole religious circle.  I enjoyed my talk with him and how we shared points back and forth without getting nasty.  He even invited me to his Church, I think I'll take a rain check for now, but I enjoyed the offer.  It was nice to have my first civil discussion on religion in a very long time.  Oh well off to work, enjoy your day all you heathens.  Leave in peace and go forth and be nice today, go hug a born again, they're not all that bad.  Love to all, take care.

       "She's always eating"...  Well first day of work was good.  My boss had the funny comment that made the title tonight.  I was always eating between clients, but healthy stuff.  Just because I am thin, doesn't mean I don't eat. I ate a couple of apples,and made them jealous with my leftovers of the wine chicken w/pasta and my homemade sauce.  I still have a hard time remembering that I am seen as this dainty little lady by some folks who haven't know me long.  Hey that's ok, let them think I am soft and sweet, it makes my harshness that much more noticed.  As far at the money making side of things go, today was pretty decent.  I had figured out how many students I need to enroll to get back on track and I am on goal day one. I don't know if it will last or not, but I am keeping my eyes on the prize.  Ok silly confession time. I am going to put up a picture of Dr bowers in my office.  I remember seeing one or two good ones on Calpernia's Vday site.  I don't want you guys to get the wrong idea, I want her picture up to remind me how hard I have to work to become a patient of hers in the next year or two.  Nobody will really know who she is, so I am not afraid that a client will get freaked out by the picture.  I do like to keep myself motivated fully at all times if possible.  I don't know why, it must be that male part still alive in me that has this addiction to drive and challenge.  I loved the pressure of work today.  I was alive again today, I was being challenged and had to think again, I was using my brain, and working for the first time in a long time.  I know it doesn't sound like much to you all, but selling dog food was tough, there were many brands,and distributors, so I had be top notch or I lost out.  My last job that lasted a month was not, it was rawhide, big whoop.  I know it is a big deal to my old boss, but I just couldn't get it up for selling cow skin and dried bull penises.  With the food it was helping pets live longer lives, with treats it was just giving your dog junk food.  With this job I am back helping, by selling education, and possibilities to folks.  I can feel good about my job,and feel purposeful if that is a real word.  My new job is more stressful than I am used to, it is my first straight commission job.  I was scared to death at first, but it is just like owning my own business, as long as they come through with the leads as promised.  The upside is the harder I work the more money I can make, the downside is if I don't sell, I don't make money, welcome to the real world baby, right.  Of course some funny shit happened to me as it always does lately.  I do thank the universe daily for the comedy.   So I am talking to one client who lives with his folks at age 37, of course to get him to talk I told him I was going to move back with my mom since I got divorced.  Well I was right, he did open up, and I noticed his eyes light up when I mentioned I was divorced.  He was 37, but looked like he was pushing  mid 50's. He may of been interested but he had about much chance of getting me on a date as I do to give birth this lifetime. I am not one all about looks, like I can be picky with my life right?  but he just didn't have that sparkle in his eye I love about the people I find attractive.  He seemed dead, all the life seemed sucked out of him, and hope wasn't home.  I am an soul snob, I look for a gleam in the eyes, and I am attracted to it.  Don't get me wrong I do enjoy the carnal, and I won't turn it away if the situation presents itself, but I love the inner light in folks.  With Co I got both, Co was so beautiful a person when I met her inside, and she happened to be gorgeous on the outside too.  I think I kind of dimmed the light on her by putting her through this.  It is still there inside though, I see it, I feel it, I am unfortunately for me still very attracted to it like a moth.  We had our time though, our dance has ended, and now we both have to move on in different directions.  I doubt I will ever find the same exact light I found in her, but I have found others with the same kind of light inside, and I am glad they are in my life.  The other funny moment came from the older lady who came in to take the class to help pay for her divorce,and to give her back a social life too.  I mentioned my pending divorce and she starting going on how all men were pigs and she wanted to neuter her husband.  I love it when gen women start bitching about men to me, its cute, weird but cute.  Most women accept me as one of their own, and I am thankful every day it happens, I just hope it doesn't ever proceed to cycles, and I don't mean Harley's.  I might be able to hold my own in the conversation, but I wouldn't feel right lieing about having it.  Oh well speaking of lieing I need to call my cousin and cancel our meeting for him saving me tomorrow. I am just not in the mood to be saved right now, maybe I'll just use the excuse up in my new subheader.  I really don't think I need to find Jesus either, not to be sacrilegious but I don't think he is lost, if so we better get him on a milk carton fast.  I get a kick out of folks who are so proud that they used to be really bad people but now they are religious and think us normal folks are evil.  I never really strayed all that much from what they call God and I consider the universe.  I have always treated others fairly,and kindly, and have been thankful for what I have.  I have had my little trips off the path, but never far,and never for long.  My cousins were so far off that path it wasn't funny.  I don't hate them for their religion I hate them for forcing it on folks. They aren't here to save the world, according to their teachings only one guy can do that, and they ain't him.  G'nite, love to all.

       He did what?...  Ok I found out late yesterday afternoon after we left the rally and I got confirmation this am about why the rally ended so abruptly.  Some idiot came up to the steps where the rally was held said a prayer and put down a vial of liquid.  The authorities decided it would be best to get us to scram not knowing the contents of said vial.  The arrested the guy, and they had hazmatt and everyone else come it to remove it.  Now it's probably just holy water or something innocent like that, but what was this guy thinking?  Praying to anyone is not going to get us to go away, God doesn't hate fags, God hates the hate both sides have for the other.  If you want to go being all like God, hug a fag you moron.  Now on the karma side of things this right wing nut has been arrested and will face the full wrath of the patriot act.  It will be nice to see someone who supports all that right wing stuff become a victim of it for a change.    Speaking of Karma..  As we were driving up the mountain on Saturday to get to Castle Craig, this idiot was behind Co in the car trying to force us to go faster then what was safer.  He was getting pissed and making Co more so, he started laying on the horn, so Co pulled over on one of the few straightaway on the mountain rd.  He held his fist up shaking it and beeping as he passed.  Well he sped off like a bat out of hell, and we didn't see him to almost the top of the mountain, where he was outside his car as it was spewing coolant all over the place and non operational.  I think he got a little  Instant Karma breakfast  that day, you shouldn't mess with the universe she is watching, and she can be harsh.   Back in the saddle..  Back to selling today, life is good.  I have had enough "vacation" this year and I need to work badly.  It will take some adjustment time, I was trained well, so I should do well.  I'll let you guys know tonight how it went down.  I am putting up a link too, so if you have ever thought about becoming a bartender, now is the time.  Ok commercial over.  Both nervous and excited for the change of career, but hey remember it was providence that got me here, now its my turn to drive I hope.  Love to all, take care.

       "Where's your husband?.."  Went to marriage equality rally with Tanya, her kidlet, Diana, D, and my bro Shawn.  It was nice to get out and ran into lots of great folks in the community.  Tanya's kidlet is so cute, she is about six months older then my daughter and hasn't a clue about stuff yet.  She was a little concerned with one of the groups voices so we had the talk that every one is different and that is what so special about being you.  She also asked me about my wig, wanting to know "why I had hair on a stand over on the shelf?"  I  in my usual quick thinking told her its easier to wash that way.  She seemed to have fun at the rally with all the different folks there, it was a first rally for both of us.  On the way back she asked me "where's your husband?"  I didn't know how to respond other than to tell her I didn't have one.  She asked "but you have kids?"  So I explained I was married when I had kids, and that they lived with my ex "nick", wow a gender neutral name for Co I loved it.  We talked for a bit on marriage and stuff and the fact my kids don't live with me.  It was so sweet that she accepted me as I appeared to be a woman, it was a boost to my self confidence, like I needed more.    The other highlight of the day was hanging out with Deja. Sorry for outing you hun.  I never really hung with her much before, only seen her at the Cos banquet, and a few twenty meetings, and of course heard of her fun loving reputation.  It was cool, her and I are allot alike, we both have a huge set of ka-honas and love to have fun.  I never realized that we had so much in common, of course lots of people only see my candy coating outside.  I love blowing people's minds once they get to really know me and meet the rougher grittier girl inside.  I do have be careful with my fucking swearing though, I guess I might piss off somebody, and they might be inspired to do some shit to some asshole.  Man I hate the fact that there are so many pussys out there who can't take a mother fucking swear every once in a while.  Sorry that was in direct response and poking a playful stab at a new friend.  I should though keep that down, I do have the ability to describe stuff without settling for the blue streak stuff, but it is fun to unload it once in awhile too.  Hope your not offended girl.  As for the description I had to change it, nobody sends me poems anymore, so why keep it.  I also added that cute little saying that Co sent me from the Christians Suck website.  I will change that one every so often for kicks.    Had a nice diner with D, she seemed a little blue, so I asked her to stay and I cooked up some chicken in red wine,and cooked up some pasta with my homemade sauce. It was so nice to have some company and be able to cook for someone else.  It is always nice to talk to her, we seem to have good conversations all the time.  Oh well better get going tomorrow is day one out of training at the new job, its showtime, put up or shut up time.  You all know I'm not the type to be quiet, so I best do the putting up.

       Not a pleasant way to start a Sunday...  Getting ready for the rally today for marriage equality and went and check out Tanya's site. She had a link on her site to a site that is obviously a few sandwiches short of a picnic.  She did of course post it, just like I am to remind everyone why we need to speak up.  There are some scary people out there, some who may be wearing brown shirts, and waving allot with that right hand way up in the air.  I just get so upset that stupid ass son's a bitches get away with spreading ignorance, hate, and non sensical information in this day in age.  The seem to blame each and every problem in the world on gays, I also saw a petition that was against CBS for Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction, and the idiots were even stating there is no such condition as intersex.  The are supporting a rally on the other side of the capital too today. Ok here is the  urlLink Homophobic Idiot Muther F's who should have their penis fall off or their holes close shut.  Warning this site got me so fucking pissed off today that I am going to pop the first little homophobic, religious right son of a bitch who starts yelling me down right in the mouth.  I guess though I might be living up to the hype that lesbians are evil, anti-social, and a menace to society.  Oh well, give em what they want I guess.  Not sure what they think of trannies, but I don't think it is good either, but unless I tell them I will be just giving off my soccer mom lesbian vibe today.  Have a great day everyone, here's hoping for a very good and peaceful rally.  And here is a better site from what I saw  urlLink Christians Suck , yes I am in a nasty mood today, thanks for fucking asking.  Love to all, take care.

       Ok it's a work in progress folks...  Ok fooling around with colors still, getting better.  Due to the stupidity and clumsiness of blogger powered comments, I have re-installed the haloscan, yeah.  Now everybody will know who did mushrooms back in 85.  And I will know who is giving me color advice and if I should heed it or not, just kidding.  Had a great day at the park with Co and the kids.  What a beautiful day.  Went and helped mom do some stuff around the house.  I am pretty sure I really don't have much of a choice in the move area, I have to do this at this time, I am not happy but I am a fighter and will do what is necessary to survive.  Chantelle helped me with my sign for tomorrow, we colored a sign in GLBT rainbow colors that reads  Love makes a family, we even put a little house on it with a heart in it,and a rainbow colored roof.  I explained to her why we were making the sign, and she told me it was "sad that some people don't want people to love each other."  Out of the mouth of babes.  She asked if she can sleep over every weekend, just her and me.  It won't be every weekend, but every one I am not doing twenty or working once I get my bar job nights.    Hope you like the new changes, I just needed to do something, suggestions are always welcome, but not necessarily implemented.  G'nite, love to all.

       Rehashing the big trip...  Ok I could have used a few more hours of sleep my kitty thought I needed to get up now, so guess who won?    I had originally planned on having little paragraphs for each day, but I have thought better of it and just cover major shit.   Travel..  Traveling is easy for me, I am a driving machine so down to PA and back was cake.  I have become so comfy at popping into the ladies room it is almost comical.  Wore out a set of batteries in my cd player on the way down and almost wore out my Melissa Etheridge tape on the way back.  I love so many of the songs on that tape (Testify, Brave and Crazy, You used to love to dance, and Baby you can sleep while I drive)  This is one of my all time favorite tapes, and I used to love to sing like her long before I knew I would be changing my voice for good.     Folks..  People are so nice down here for the most part, its east coast still but a little more friendly than New England folk.  Got flirted with and hit on a few times, yikes.  I of course am half to blame for my fashion choices, which I assure you were all business but nicely cut to show off my assets too.  I noticed lots of big women down here too.  I think it's all the Dutch blood from the locals to the south, and the fact that this used to be farm country that grows them big down there.  All I know I am glad to fit in at my height somewhere.  Maybe we need to have a little trans colony down there.   Surroundings..  The area was ok, very built up and commercial not what I expected by Billy Joel's lyrics about the place.  The hotel was cool, it was small but nice.  It was a Microtel, which is a bargain business traveler place, had the important shit, bed, desk, bathroom, free breakfast, it even had a really cool window seat.  It wasn't much of a view, but it was comfy to sit back look out at the surroundings and write my book.  Got a good amount done for the time spent on it. No pool which sucked, no workout facilities so I feel fat. The highway that cuts through the area is so much like the Merritt it isn't funny, and the main drag like the Berlin Tpk that I felt so much like I was home.  There were even lots of folks that drive like the idiots do here.  The highway entrances are short and lots of folks ease all the way to the end, and leave no room to accelerate.   Important discoveries..  Ok let me tell you first hand, Secret is NOT strong enough for a man, trust me.  Weather was nice and warm, and I found quickly that I still sweat in the heat.  I did breathe great down there, and I have noticed already today that I am having trouble here again.  I am sad to say I think it is my kitty, and I will need to go get tested for allergies to her.    Ok the big shit now.  I noticed quite the change in me this week.  I have always been good in business but never deadly aggressive, or possessing that competitive edge.  Well I noticed that changed this week.  I developed quite a swagger in my step and a confidence in my attitude.  I love that I have become a strong business woman now, I have this certain feeling about myself now that I saw in a nice looking gal at RAW when I went for the Creative Cocktail hour last month.  She was pretty obviously a lesbian or at least wanting to give off that vibe, short hair, men's type pin striped suit.  She was older, and a little thin, but her confidence and her aura made her one of the most attractive women in the whole joint.  I don't know what did it, but I became dangerous on my trip, I am now an empowered woman, who is stronger now then I ever was before as a man.  All the bullshit static in my head is gone now, I am getting to be the strong person I have always known myself to be.  I am not totally full of myself, but I am comfortable here.  I am not afraid to be a little more aggressive then I was as Scott, and push things that before I couldn't.  I think that going through these last few years and the fact I am still here after being down so low has helped the bravado. Like I need more. It is nice too, since I look so sweet and innocent, yet if I had to I'd gut you like a pig. Ok, not really. My boss though likes my brash attitude, and as unfortunate and material as it may sound I need money.  I am not going to screw folks out of money by selling them some shaky investment, or a sportscar they don't need, but an education that they do need.  It is nice to sell change in life, and help folks that need a little direction in their life right now, been there done that, have the empty potted meat cans to prove it.  I look forward to work on Monday. I am woman hear me roar.  I also will admit that when I can I still pee standing, it is just easier to get it all out.  I don't know who really thought of the idea of mirrors in front of the toilet,but I used it to my advantage.  I looked up once and felt my stomach sour as I looked at my manhood.  I don't know exactly what set it off, but all of sudden I started working through the surgery in my imagination.  I envisioned the incisions they are going to make, them removing the erectile tissue, forming my neo-vagina and stuffing it back in.  I also envisioned how the new product would look on me.  I had always pictured it or imagined in my head, but never visually before. It was weird and awesome at the same time to visually picture what they are going to do to me on my own equipment.  I had always been able to play this visual trick on myself by getting my eyes watery and playing with the focus I used to picture my face as more female.  I cannot wait until I get to see mine for real.  OMG we need a Quiznos up here.  They absolutely have the best grinders/sandwiches anywhere.  The best way to describe them is using the analogy that Starbucks is to Dunkin Donuts as Quiznos is to subway.  The selection is upscale and top knotch, not to many diet choices,but sometimes you just gotta say WTF and live a little, of course I haven't jumped on my scale yet either.  If you are traveling and see one of these, stop in and try it, I don't think you will be disappointed.  Can't wait until they get up here.   Really silly shit..  I heard this conversation yesterday where a salesman for a radio station in the same building as my company was eyeing a 22 yr old hottie.  He stated" hey I'm just a red blooded male.."  I was so tempted to say so am I that I got the "so" out before I cleared my throat and said "sorry, excuse me."   This one guy I met at class who is an older gentle men came to say goodbye to me after he graduated goes to shake my hand and say pleased to meet you, and he bowed his head as an old fashioned gentleman.  It was so nice to be treated like a princess, but if you are going to bow to the princess, just get on the knees buddy,(just kidding).  I have already gotten a bad nickname at work.  The school that I am going to is run by folks in their late 20's so I am the older one.  My boss was pulling at a string on his shirt, and he ended up taking off a button.  He asked if I had a needle and thread on me.  Of course I had both in my bag in the car.  So now I am the den mother of the school.  First a soccer mom, now a den mother. God I hate this, I could make a sex tape, get 5 tattoos, get arrested for who knows what, and still come off as motherly.  Oh well let them call me a mother, its better than when they called me a mother f'er I guess.  Glad to be back, going on a picnic with the kidlets, and having Chantelle sleep over tonight, will have her help me with a sign for tomorrows rally on equality for marriage.  Got a great email that my student friend's project is done, and I am going to be on display in June, I cannot wait to go see what she did with those fun pictures and my words.  I will pass on more information as we get closer.  Love to all, take care.

       HOME...  Wow what a long week, glad to be home.  Too tired to post long tonight, but have funny stuff from trip I will share tomorrow.  God I miss my laptop.  Catching up on e-mail pile.  Upset only one person thought enough to comment on my question about my considered move. Oh well it beats nobody taking the time to comment back.  I need rest, & I'm horny too for some odd reason, but then again what else is new?  G'nite, love to all.     The Bitch is back!!!

       Ok new user interface right before I leave...  Came on to blog tonight and got a pretty bad email from a friend in need.  I never turn away any friend who needs help, I remember not having anyone when I was trying in my youth, and I remember how it felt, so I will try to help anyone who asks.  But tonight's person was a true friend, so it was an easy decision.  I was actually IMing between three folks tonight at the same time, it was hard at first but got easier quickly, heard of three ways but a four way, gasp, I am sore.  I think all ended well with the friend she has my number is she needs to talk more during the week.  I won't be around all week and since I don't have a laptop anymore you all will have to do without my bitching or my insight on stupid shit.  I had planned to have co post for me, but with having to watch two kidlets, it would be too tough.  I am not that special that you all can't live with out me for a few days.  Just don't get pissed when I don't return emails you send.  When I get back I will weed them out from the piles of ads for refinancing and penis enlarging pills that litter my mailboxes.  On a really serious note, I am thinking of moving.  I need a roommate to help cut down on costs, if I am ever going to get surgery.  My mom has been pressuring me to move in with her since Paul died.  I am almost sure I am going to move in with her.  I would save tons of $ from splitting stuff with her, I would have a yard again, maybe get a dog again, and most of all spend a little more time with someone I miss.  Mom has been so great with this, she has really accepted me as her daughter and it is so special to me.  Her and my dad split when I was about 12 and we lived with dad, that's why I know my way around a kitchen and how to do girly shit. I was the oldest and had to help dad out, so I learned to cook and clean along with manly stuff too.  It is weird but it helped me allot in becoming the domestic goddess I am today.  This week will give me some thinking time about this, and you all can post your thoughts below.  I know it seems odd for a 34 year old to move back in with mom, but I would rather seem a little odd and get surgery sometime next year then live alone and be totally independent and be in my 60's before I got it.  No offense to my older sisters out there.  I also think its good for mom to have me around, I can fix lots of shit, and I can cook healthier food for her. We had a discussion on fatty foods today, she has no idea on how much is too much.  It won't be an easy decision, and I have to check my lease on getting out, but if it continues this way for too long, they might kick me out.  I have always been on time with my rent, but I am so on the edge right now, if I got sick one week, I wouldn't be able to pay my rent, so it's time.  I just need to plan an exit stratedgy.   Also talking about GICNE at twenty and figured out what months they are meeting now.  I figured the board will meet in December and February, this means I should go to the December meeting I think.  I may not be able to afford surgery for awhile longer then I first planned but the approval would mean lots to me.  It meant so much to me just to be diagnosed, to be approved for surgery would be triumphant.  Oh well got a while to think on it, and save like a maniac.  Be well you all better be here when I get back from Pa.  I will post in the am if I have time but don't count on it.   Be well, may God or the Universe, Allah, Yahweh, or whoever runs your universe bless and protect you, and treat you well.  May your days be warm and your nights be restful.  May the sex be long and satisfying or your supply of batteries plentiful, and don't forget the KY.    Love to all, take care.

       Asthma mystery solved...  I finally solved the whole mystery of that nasty asthma attack the other day while rollerblading with a friend who is a carido queen.  I haven't had much time to watch the news and haven't bought a paper since last Sunday.  I know this sounds very bad of me, but I have been checking stuff out online since I have been so busy, including weather.  When checking weather online all I care about is temp and precipitation.  Well finally got to watch the weather on TV this morning and they said that tree pollen levels were at severe levels right now, and that the rain should help knock it down a bit, but it would still be strong.  So JR wasn't trying to kill me, mother nature was/is.  I hate these allergies, and I think living in the valley has amplified them more then the "clean" mountain air I have lived in for the last 10+ years.  I will just have to take it a little easy until the pollen settles down for good.  I wonder how the air will be down in PA, taking my inhaler just for sure.  Need to get back to picking out clothes for my trip, I forgot how nice I look(hey somebody has to love me) in business woman attire.  It sure beats the dockers and golf shirts from my old life.  Thank God that I finally started this, I might seem miserable in some areas, but over all I am happier then I have ever been.  Sad isn't it?  Love to all, take care.

       Touched by laughter, haunted by demons, starting the chain...  Wow a very bi-polar type day today.  Started off in Zen ended in tears, laughed heartily inbetween, welcome to my blessed life.     The funny shit..  Had lunch with a friend who is having some pretty major marital troubles and is going to court to put an end to the marriage.  I knew they were pretty bad off and not ending things well but I had no idea how much.  Yeah I know sounds real funny so far right?  Ok so while at lunch we are talking and I am informed that my friends wife thinks I am having an affair with my friend.  Now I love my friend deeply, but there is bigger an age difference then even I am ok with, but my friend is a lovely person.  I am not interested in the person in any other way then just friends, and I think the feeling is mutual.  I feel so bad that I burst out laughing when my friend told me this, but all I could think is that I have been a woman for not even 6 months and I am be accused of being a home wrecker and the other woman.  I hope my friend understands as I explained why I was laughing.  But the utter amount of pain they both are in right now is most likely taking away any sunny outlook they may have had at one point.   The Demons..  Ok all of us in this community just like everyone in life is haunted by some sort of demon.  In our community though at least there seems to be themes.  Some folks have to deal with the demon of passing, others loosing friends, for some its stealth vs. out, lots deal with loss of privledge, many deal with all, I deal with a nasty one myself, the family demon.  I have tried so hard to beat this demon like I have beaten the others, I pass well, I have no trouble being out in certain places but stealth in others, I never had much in the way of privledge before to miss now, but this one is tougher.  I laugh when the older crowd whose kids are already grown give me the old "oh you're so lucky, your young and so are your kids."  Well I really wish that were entirely true.  It is so hard to be missing out on my kids growing up around me.  Everytime I see them my son is more and more distant from me, and it is harder then anything I have had to deal with thus far.  I went over after twenty and Co made this kick ass meal for us.  It was nice for awhile but soon I felt very uncomfortable there.  This is the place we lived in before we were married, in total I believe we spent 7-8 years there.  There are many memories and ghosts in that place, and her brother upstairs.  I jumped at every little noise like it was him coming down to have a talking to me, or to come see the "freak".  It was such a step backwards to the scared little person I was before as I was first starting my part time rlt.  I have grown( or at least thought I had) strong enough to not be scared anymore.  I had planned originally to spend the night on her couch, but drove home in tears instead. I just had to get out tonight, and I don't know exactly why.  I am not loosing my mind, I just don't think it is healthy right now to be going somewhere that I have to be so scared in while being so brave and open everywhere else, not to mention the hurt I feel from days of yore.  I still have immense feelings for Co that will never be answered, and I don't hate her for that, in fact I totally support and understand her position, yet it still fucking hurts the same.  Eventually I will heal fully, I hope, and if not completely banish this demon come to a peace with it that I can live with.   The Chain book..  Ok now the silly savior in me, like I am somebody who can fix anything?  I just had to go get a copy of the Velveteen Rabbit for a friend who is having issues about being a real woman.  I know its a kids book, and it may seem silly to give such a thing to an adult, but if you read the book you will understand.  It goes through and tells the story of a little stuffed toy rabbit who gets to become real because it is loved, even though all the other toys tell it that becoming real will never happen.  It is amazing that it does have so many trans-issues in it.  So I went and spent my $9 on the book and then going to the check out I got this wonderful idea.  I decided to make this a "chain book".  I wrote a little note in the front of the book explaining that real is how you feel, and that "you are receiving this book because you are loved by someone."  I also ask that when they are done to write a little note in it, and pass it along to someone else who is either not feeling loved, or that is having issues with being "real".  I wonder how far it will get?  It got as far as I originally hoped it would by just giving to my friend, so anybody else is an extra.  I hope it does help other folks, this book is one of the things that really helped me in my youth, not as a little kid, but as a teenager.  A teacher had given it to his daughter when she turned 16 to show her she didn't need to do stuff that other kids did to fit in and be a real young adult, she already was because she had self worth since her dad loved her.  I know it is a flawed argument, and full of wholes, but so is most religion, yet millions of folks subscribe to that.  This is just trying to get people to realize they have value in their lives.  Ok g'nite, gotta go work on some demons, and pack in the am for my big trip.  Love to all.

       Ah momentary Zen...  It has been a hard two weeks.  Classes to late night, learning tons of flavors,alcohols, and drink recipes.  While doing this I left a job where I loved the customers, but not the company, had two new friends have mini breakdowns, dealt with another round of insomnia, and of course one hell of an asthma attack.  Well I graduated class last night once I just blasted my shit kicking music and let go the stress, and I have a lead already for a bartending gig, Sat and Sun evenings.  I of course have the new job starting on Monday.  Both my friends that were in bad places are now in good places.  I have two great new friends from class that I will be working with, Tanya even took me out and bought me a drink last night while Cory boy ditched us for a straight boy he is trying to turn gay, like that's possible.  I am having a better time breathing, the asthma is still there but with the stress level taken down a knotch or two I really don't feel it as bad.  I get to go see my kids and co tonight, living alone sucks, and they are so cute I end up missing them more.(like if they were ugly I wouldn't?)  As if this all wasn't enough Krispy Kreme is coming out with a diet donut, I guess I can have donuts again.  So all is well for now, and while it may not last long I really don't give a shit, it's cool now, I'm soaking it in , and living the moment.  Oh, and Ms. Universe when you get my complaint letter I sent the other day, rip that muther up please.  Love to all, take care.

       Ok one last post...  Was lurking on a very gruff site G.O.D( gospel of the dyke) I will put up a link another time, she is funny but the anti-Ashley.  For as sickly sweet as you all think I am she is as rough.  Anyway I love the brutal honesty of her site and her take on shit. While there I saw a link that I had check out.  It is a very satirical look at how main stream society treats latinos.  I watched the trailer and can't wait for it to come around here.  I will post the link so you all can check it out for yourselves. urlLink ADWAM .  Its comedy reminds me of the same ilk of "But I'm a cheerleader". Enjoy I really need to get back to studying.

       "Yes sir, we will fix that for you"...  Ok no ambition to go out, will do shopping in the am before twenty and go to Hartford when I get back from PA.  Catching up on shit I need to do calling Dr.'s paying bills and such.  Also studying and doing a little knitting.    Called my gp's office to have them do another script for Scott for the inhaler.  I went into old voice just fine, but I had enough.  I have been delaying changing the name on my insurance for a while since Co and the kids were still on it.  We got them situated on other plans now so its just me.  I hate the fact that I am in RLT yet I still had to do some shit as Scott if only by name.  I even had bloodwork done awhile back and freaked some poor lady out (I think) by her seeing this gal named Scott get bloodwork.  So I called up my insurance company to change it to Ashley.  I get this really nice guy Jeff on the phone and he asks for the name on the card, I tell him Scott he replies "How can I help you sir".  I cannot explain the feeling I felt at being called sir, it reminded me how truly unhappy I was with myself while a man.  So I give him my new address, and I had mentioned a name change at the beginning of the call.  Jeff says "ok, you said you had a name change too sir?"  "Well its a little more then a name change, the sir changed too." I replied. "Oh! What is your name now then?" he asked squeamishly.  I told him the name, I could feel his discomfort and awkwardness through the phone, but we got through all the stuff we needed to and he ends the call with "thank you sir, we'll get that new card right out to you."  Ok I almost went apeshit on him, but I decided to let him slip. I was using an inbetween voice that could go either way, I am sure he doesn't deal with changes like I had every day, so I kept quiet.  I don't care what some guy answering phones thinks about me, as much as I care about finally getting rid of one of the last remnants from a life I sorta miss at times, but a person I do not.    Its hard to love what you did in your life while hating who you were.  I have a hard time explaining it to anyone.  I am very proud of how I came really out of nothing to achieve things I thought I wouldn't achieve in my life just a few years earlier, but I hated I had to achieve them as Scott. I miss some of the stuff like Co, kids, house, old friends.  But I think the universe's way of paying me back for pulling this on me is all the great new friends I have now.  Before friends would be people you go play hockey with, grab a drink, talk sex, and then go home.  I thought that was friendship and camaraderie.  Now I go twice a month sit and talk with a great group of folks as we try to help each other through some tough shit.  I have friends that I talk to constantly online, from all over the country,  even one from out in Australia.  They are folks of every shape, size, gender,and preference.  I go hiking or do other stuff with some of them too.  This is nice.  Before most of my old friends were just a bunch of testosterone ridden boys with a common love of sports, that's it.  My new friends are good people, some ahead of me, some behind me on the road to full transition, but all good folks.  I even have made some friends in the gay community also.  Before I was thought as a homophobic Republican type, since I portrayed the conservative professional white male.  I WAS(past tense) the republican, but never the homophobe.  Now those who know about me, are very kind and open to me, its cool to belong after not for so long.  So while I wish my life had been different then this path I am on, I am certainly happy I have had the honor to make so many friends on that path.  I hope I am as much of an asset to you all as you have been to me.  Love to all, take care.

       Last day of being unemployed...  Got lots to try to do today and not allot of time.  Monday is my first official day at my new job, have to drive all the way to Allentown, beats Pittsburgh though.  I have to go to Hartford to pick up the tickets to the Rockcats I won for the kidlets.  I also need to call my old doctor to get a new script for my inhaler med.  I woke up breathing fine, but ran down and back up my stairs in my usual old male hurriedness, and became out of breath.  Ok so the allergen is most likely in my house, makes sense, I did have to stop on the trail yesterday, but the breathing got much worse when I got home.  I am vacuuming everything today, maybe it's just shit built up.  I hadn't felt the effects of allergies this bad since when I smoked.  I guess I shouldn't expect to escape 17+ years of smoking a pack and a half a day of cowboy killers without having some side effects.  I tried a few times to quit, but failed, when Dr. P told me he wouldn't give me hormones if I kept smoking I quit right away.  Funny how the right incentive can do the job.  Dr. Phil has couples messed up by mixed up situations; gay hubby, big age difference, and a tranny hubby.  He said something so interesting in the opening, "There are over 2,000,000 couples living in this country that are affected by g/l/t problems."  I don't know why he left out the bi's but he most likely grouped them with the g's and the l's.  I hate the fact that Co and I are a couple that must face these issues, but I am finding more and more we are not alone.  While that itself doesn't help anyone, maybe as more of us continue to find each other and have the strength to come out we can get more help in easing pain.  I also have to go make that shopping trip, I may hold off until tomorrow, but I have to get Co a...(not going to tell).   I am getting my mom some shrubs from Loews, she loves her yard.  Last year I built her a shelter for her statue of the Virgin Mary I bought for her a few years back.  I don't believe in the power of religious idols, but if it helps my mom get through some tough shit, which it has, then I support her wanting them.  I feel bad that this years present didn't take 100+hours of work over a year and a half, like the shelter.  Wow I think that was the last project I made as Scott.  I was always busy, fixing or making stuff, or out in my yard moving rocks, building gardens.  I do miss having a workshop, but I doubt I would have much time to do it.  Some day A.S. (after surgery) I will have a house again, with a workshop, and this time a sunroom or 3 season porch, flatter yard.  I love gardening but hate cutting grass, every yard I have ever had has always been somewhat hilly.  I know its weird to put something off till after a big thing like surgery, but the way I look at it, I have this drive from this.  After I reach surgery I can focus that elsewhere, and in my personal life its a house.  Of course I need to investigate this sort of creepy feeling I have that I need to move to New Mexico.  I have never been there,  orseen many pictures, and have done only basic curious investigation of certain areas.  I can't explain it, but something in the desert is beckoning me.  Mother ship?   TS Phone  Home...   No I am of this earth I assure you, but something higher or spiritual is calling me out to that area.  Maybe if I do follow my gut and go with Dr. Bowers I will fly into New Mexico and travel up into Colorado.  That is if she stays there, keep hearing rumblings from folks (who I think aren't in the know) saying she wants to move.    I tend to be very cautious when hearing rumors.  If she is and does want to move, I would like to suggest somewhere on the East coast.  I cannot see myself moving away from Co and the kids, I miss not seeing them every day, moving far away would cut it down to once a year, not going to happen.  Maybe once they are grown.  Going to try some old Ti-Chi exercises to help with the breathing.  Love to all, take care.

       One down one to go, another test and one more show...  Sorry for the Yes sortta flashback, not a huge fan, but I went through my phase back in the 80's.  Tonight was tough.  Had a stressful day helping out a friend, Asthma flare up, preparing for the test, wrote a goodbye letter to the boss I had to come out to. Mainly was thanking him for all the years we worked together, and that I don't hate his guts, oh yeah and goodbye since I won't be able to stop in like I was doing.  I hit my inhaler again on the way to class and my carpool buddy for school noticed me shaking.  My inhaler is a little old and I think Albuterol is one of those meds that gets stronger when it goes past expiration.  I use mine so infrequently that it expired back in 1999, my son wasn't even conceived yet, I was still playing hockey, weighed over 200lbs, managing an Agway and still living in a small apartment with Co and our daughter.  1999 was also the year that changed my life.  It  had less to do with my issues then learning how to achieve what I wanted in life.  I learned so much that year that helped me achieve in life, relationships, and eventually led to  a so far successful transition.  I won't get into it too much today, but thank you Anthony Robbins.  Ok so where was I?  Ok nerves shot, emotionally drained and shaking from so bad medication, worried that I would fail my test.  So I do my last little cram, pull out my cowardly lion little thing, and take my test.  A gal in my class didn't want music on, so I being the good little bitch I am agreed.  I thought I did ok, but as I watched my instructor grade my test I saw so many errors from not paying full attention to the names, and I got some basic shit messed up to, wrong glasses.  So after all is said and done I got a 56 the absolut lowest score you can get where they let you retake it the same night.  I was crushed beyond belief.  Was I going to come this far in attempting to get a second job to make my transition short as possible only to hit a mental block and fail to get the certification that would get me the job?   No f in way!   I haven't come thus far to fail, I refuse to become roadkill,yet.  I gathered myself, I didn't even think of crying, that's unusual for me lately when shit goes bad.  I studied for another 10 minutes and found a new way to remember all the different formulas we learned.  I blasted the new cd I made today, and just went with the flow. I got a 94, I only got the garnish on a LI ice tea wrong, the vermouth amount in a vodka gibson wrong,and something else silly wrong.  I was so glad to have such an improvement once I got my head clear.  Now for the tough one where I have to make 12 drinks in 7 minutes.  It will be tough but if I focus and find that spot I will do just fine.  I need to call my gp  and get a new inhaler script.  I had read that some hormones may effect asthma.  I have always had spring allergies so maybe its them. My cat has been shedding like mad though, I pray to God I am not becoming allergic to her, she is my only companion right now I see everyday.  I know it sounds sad as I write this, and I am sure I won't end up the little old lady who lives alone with her cat or cats, but for now she's good for me and she really needed a good home when I came across her.  I would add another pill to my regiment before I would part with her.  G'nite to all.

       Going to make you sweat to you bleed...  Wow, I am not in as good as shape as I thought I was.  I just went blading with Supergirl today and she had to stop for me more than once.  I was put to shame in the jazzercise queen vs. veteran hockey player skating challenge.  I knew she was physically fit, but OMG I didn't realize she was in tip top cardiovascular shape, I am obviously not, yet.  Oh well, I guess it gives me a goal to shoot for. I don't know why maybe its my spring allergies,I hope,but my breathing has been very good and I hadn't felt the affects of my Asthma in quite awhile, but I actually had to hit my inhaler on the way home.   I have never had trouble skating the trail before, I have done it many times, but she just does it quicker.  I am glad to see I am still human, too many victories was starting to make me feel almost bulletproof.  That is a dangerous place to be, I am lucky I haven't run into something that I couldn't handle.  This also shows me I really need to start doing more exercise wise then what I am currently doing.    Had the balls to wear just the bandanna for rollerblading and to Walmart beforehand.  I was scared shitless walking into Walmart and had a little 20 something bitch chuckle at me, but I think it wasn't because she thought I was a man, as much as she thought I looked funny to her.  Gave my rollerblading buddy a peak at what my real hair looks like, Ok now 4 people know now, I don't like to share it too much so I think I won't be sharing with anybody else anytime soon.  I did get comfy with the bandanna idea, and think I may wear more as time goes on.   Need to go catch my breath shower and study for the big test.

       Crack o dawn...  Up early this morning need to exercise soon or my scale will start going up again.  Actually got someone to go with today, so I will have another person to talk to other than the voices in my head.  I may go out today for the first time with just the bandanna.  I am afraid to do so though, don't know why, my real hairline isn't totally horrible, just that of an old ladies.  I do have a reputation to keep up you know.   Today is the big day one of testing, we have a written test today and have to remember 40 out of 150 or so recipes, 10 flavors, and 10 call brands from a good sized list of names.  I also came up with another new drink last night  The Vibrator  or for you good little Catholic Girls,  BOB  good luck explaining the second name to someone, but as for its ingredients it is 1/2oz vodka, 1/2oz blue cuaraco, 1/2oz oj, 1 1/2 oz cream, and shake it like you own it.  Its basically what they call an electric creamsicle,  I shortened the name to electric cream, and then to just Vibrator. Any time you substitute Blue Cuaraco for another orange liquor it becomes electric, so I am not a total pervert.  I have been toying around with the smurf looking shit all week and both my drinks contain it.  As for the other name BOB, well that is how a good little ex-protestant/catholic(yes I've been both) gal like me talks about a vibrator in mixed company, its a battery operated boyfriend.  Thanks Co for teaching me that lingo.  Added a new link for a new friend.  She's another CT gal, who has been so sweet to me and doesn't give a shit about me being TS. She just started updating again after she saw how much I do mine.  I check it daily, this way I can stay up to date on her stalking me.  Just kidding.  Lots of cool links off of her site for those long nights when nobody's around, you got no batteries, and your not in the mood for tv.    Have a great day all.  I will let you know tonight how I did on my test.  Tomorrow is speed drills, the harder part,12 drinks 7 minutes only one drink allowed wrong.  Pressure.  Funny looking back on my post I guess my sarcastic bite and darkish humor are still with me, they are just  morning things.  Can't wait to get back to a somewhat normal schedule, but working from 11-8 will be as close as I get for now.  Love to all, take care.

       Forgot the gossip...  Supposedly it became "official" yesterday.  Friends close to the reclusive Wachowski brothers the creators of the Matrix movies confirmed a rumor I heard quite awhile ago.  Larry Wachowski is about to become Linda Wachowski.  Bravo to you Ms. W if it is true.  I so identified with the movies, I saw an underlying trans element to them involving being stuck in a life you don't want, and didn't sign up for.  It also was like a fantasy kind of thing, that maybe I too am really a chick and they have me plugged into the wrong reality, I got put into a man reality program instead.  Oh well crazy film dissecting rantings again.  If the rumor is true I am so happy, for every person in the public eye that comes out with this the shadows become a little brighter, and we become a little safer. That is why I am out, and while I may have touched a small part of New England with this, there are more folks out there sympathetic to our cause now then before.  I hope I can continue to try and do my part, hiding sucks, but is still necessary sometimes too.  With my coming out, others may too, and so on and so forth.  I only did it after finding strength from others who did it before me, had to do my part for some crazy ass reason that even I don't know, just doing what the universe needs me to do, to make it worth me being here.  Thanks for the Matrix, and hope its not just a rumor Linda.

       Shopping quest...  Moms day is coming so I need to make sure both Co and my mom both get something good, I will take Chantelle out after 20(maybe) to buy something personal from her.  I also need to restock my traveling supplies, I am off to Allentown, Pa next week for training for the new job.  I haven't traveled yet as a woman, should be interesting, I may bring my one piece that camouflages really good and take a dip in the pool if they have one, and I have the nerve to.  I might have lots of bravado, but I still get scared at certain situations.  I also need to find a pair of femme athletic type sneakers.  I don't have big feet, I bounce between 9-10 depending on the maker, but the way they make women's sneakers today, it looks like I still have man feet.  Trying to find a nice purple or pink accented pair, not too girly but somewhat girly.  I also am on a very special quest for a book.  I need it as a reminder and I think it will be good to lend to some trans friends when the discussion of am I real comes up.  I remember my nutty highschool history teacher Mr. Boyles talking to us about it and how he gave it to his daughter on her 16th birthday to remind her that she is worthy without peer praise, it is the Velveteen Rabbit.  The story follows a stuffed toy rabbit that wants to be real so bad, and that is all he ever thinks about(sound familiar) he tries so hard to be real, and it tells about being real in a good way.  I am going to buy an extra copy for a friend who is having a rough time and thinks she will never be real, hope it helps her.    I also need to restock on writing supplies to work on my book.  I have the chapter to work on that follows the crazy times of my youth, no roof sometimes, other times no car, and my life with Co.  Not going to be an easy thing to write.  I will also go back and rewrite about coming out, and start on rlt so much has happened in the months since starting rlt fulltime. Half of me is proud that it has been over 3 months already, the other half goes "only three months, felt like a year or two?"  It has been the hardest time of my life, but also in some fucked up way the happiest too.  I started another book on how to make battle plans as I call them for transition and for life in general.  I have reconsidered and still am contemplating it.  I know I don't seem like I have been doing this long, but I was given a very important life changing lesson in life planning/achieving one's goals, I just changed it a bit to focus more on this. I need to share it. That is not where the problem lies. The problem is that I am afraid I have been too much of a cheerleader, encouraging openly for others to try it if that is what they wish, pushing before they are ready.  I tend to beat myself up, I know it shows here don't it?  I for the most part still see the scared stupid little man I was, not the confident gal I am, so when I look back I think "wow if an idiot like me can do it, anyone can."  WRONG, now that I am in a little deeper I see lots of pain, pain from failing or fear of failing.  I don't want to add pain to others lives.  One needs to be totally ready themselves to do this.  This isn't for the faint of heart and if you do not do it with all you got, and believe it down to the very molecular level of your heart, you will fail.  I can't help you, only you can.  I will contemplate my plan book somemore, and sit on it, like my sci-fi book that is sitting and spinning right now.  As I rebuild my life and get things back one by one, I will reexamine projects and writings to see what is good and what is bird cage liner.  Oh well better get some pet birds again, I have a feeling I will have lots of liner.  I am pretty sure I will make some money one day doing this, it just comes so natural and I get compliments all the time, just need to finish a project and go for it.     Appointment for saving..  Cousin Mitch got a hold of me today and we set up an appointment for my saving, the Tuesday I get back from training.  I know it is a waste of time,but if I don't let him try, he won't go away.  I am very comfortable with my spirituality, and I know the bible pretty good and I am prepared to be beaten with it.  The problem is I beat back, I have found, and had it confirmed by others, like that trans goddess Calpernia, that the best way to beat a bible beater is with the bible.  It is such a huge book,  you are sure to find something your accuser or savior is doing in their own life that is wrong.  Oh yeah I should mention, THERE ISN'T ANYTHING IN THE BIBLE AGAINST THIS.  There is no "thou shall not be happy, and become congruent".  There is nothing about changing sex in the bible, yet the religious right still feel it is wrong.  There is nothing about computers in the bible are they evil?  You see my point I am sure.  Well I guess I will be studying the bible in the hotel and adding ammo to my notes.  But who knows, maybe I will be posting on the 19th that I have been saved and made straight through faith.  Yeah right, a taffy puller and a steam roller couldn't make me straight again hun, full ride till I die.  This is my place, my lot, my fate.  It took awhile for me to see, it will take longer for others to see too.    Oh well better get going, will need a quick nap in the pm, up too late last night, helping friends.  If I did help, and their smiles through the computer were legit, it is worth it.  I hate to see good strong people who are very capable be torn down by things, all they need is an ear, glad they think enough of me to use mine,and to listen to the rantings of this lunatic.  Love to all take care.

       In Search of...  Ok no its not Leonard Nemoy, its my quest for staying fit.  I love to rollerblade,but weather sometimes makes it tough to keep a regular workout schedule.  I will be going Thursday am though.  I would love to go back to playing hockey, and go back to a nice safe position like goalie, but its not cheap to play, and I would most likely be recognized.  I can't really jog, Dr.'s removed over half the cartilidge from my right knee, and the bone shaved down due to scar tissue build up.  This is where I developed my high pain threshold, I only did pain meds for a day or two after both, I hate being doped up on pills.  I hope this remains true after srs.  I was thinking about aerobics or jazzercise since a friend is addicted to it.  It is hard to find a schedule that fits my new work schedule.  I found a local place that does an early am class, but only on Saturday.  I work too late for evening classes.  My next option is Curves, but I am concerned with being in an all gal place.  I really don't worry about my passing anymore, I do get made from time to time, but it is rare, and usually involves me reverting to old aggressive habits or just being in a bad mood.  I do worry though when the issue of showers and changing rooms arise, obviously I won't be using them, but most restrooms are in the changing areas.  This will be a no-no and because I really hydrate when I work out, it most likely won't work.  For now I will just use the facilities we have here in my complex.  It is a small place but I think it will work for now.  I will just have to go get a walkman and make some upbeat cds.  I will find and go check out the local curves just to see how it is set up.  Got my handwieghts, and a treadmill over there at the clubhouse, will have to start doing ab workouts at home.   Oh well need to go, IMing with a good friend, making plans for our futures. G'nite and love to all.

       Co's response...  Ok I don't want this page to seem like Ash and Co's love battleground but after a few days of thinking it over I had to post Co's poetic response to what I wrote for her.  It kinda sucks the position we have been put in by this, but when you step back and reexamine it, its not all that bad.  While our relationship as lovers and husband and wife are over, our friendship has blossomed from that death.  Yes we get into little disagreements over going to pride, or me wanting to rush things, but all in all we are friends, like I have equated before almost like sisters.  So please don't shed any tears for either of us, we may be hurting in the love arena, but we are extraordinarily blessed with friendship.  Ok Co's poem, off to register to vote, pay the rent, and call my born again cousin to see how he intends to "save me".  I think that I am too far gone for saving hun, but go ahead and try. Love to all take care.  Choices..by Nicole   Its really a series of choices  how we go on through our life. I hate that one of those choices is I'll no longer be your wife.  I've lost a husband but kept a friend one who I hope will stay till the end.  I never wanted to be one of those women who needs a man in her life. But I want a husband and want to be a wife.  I never could have imagined I could miss you so much I miss your smell I miss your touch.  I look back and see how many ways we've been blessed but then think why did we end up in this mess?  I will need to watch you go through many a change and honestly lots of it is strange.  You've changed your voice You've changed your hair You've even changed your appearance when you are bare.  Sometimes I get so mad this is happening that I just want to scream. But what kind of person would I be to stop you from achieving your dream?  It was such a short time I was blessed to be your wife, I hope the memories will stay with us for life.  I loved when the kids started calling you "Daddy" Now I need to love that they call you "Maddie"   Ashley... Forever you will be my soulmate until the end of time. Thank you for being the person that you are, and not being afraid to become more.  You have taught me alot about life and choices, and I hope we can teach our children the same thing, and they can grow up being loving, unpredjudiced people.

       Lots of drinks in a short time...  Whew had to learn 33 drinks for tonight's class, highball and fruity drinks.  reg highballs are easy, some you just learn little sayings for like the woo-woo, its Vodka,Cranberry ,topped with Peach schnapps, or in my perverted lingo Vagina, cun*, pussy three words for a woo-woo.  I know its more than a little sick, but I am more than a little overdue for something in a sexual release kind of way so forgive the nasty talk.  I even invented a new drink tonight with the help of Ta.  I call it my   screwed blue and tattooed     Basically its a screw driver made with Captain Morgan, so you have the screw and the tattoo for the cap., and the blue comes from blue curacao which is another orange flavor and very blue in color.  This whole section was fun, I used to drink lots of the drinks on the list, like the sloe comfortable screw, or the easy 7&7 or whiskeybuck.  I am going in early on Wednesday to review all I have learned and studying at home.  I get to take my written test on Thursday, I know all the flavors, and most of the call brands, hope I don't choke on the drink recipes.  Practice makes perfect.  Only 22 more recipes to master according to my math. I do highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn to make drinks, or wants to get a bartending job.  As a bonus if you take the night class you get the pleasure of meeting Ta who is the instructor.  I will put up a link for it after graduation.  I also decided on my first drink I will have once I am cleared to drink after surgery, a tequila sunrise.  I have never done tequila before, ever, I love the whole sunrise thing on a new day, and the initials are TS, hmm sees like a fit.  I can imagine the looks I will get as this girly looking gal, drinks her tequila sunrise and smokes a nice cigar in celebration of surviving with my sanity, hopefully I will make it.  I do miss smoking every once in a while and think a cigar while gross will be a nice thing to do to finally wind down.  Oh well good night, and next time you are out drinking have a screwed blue and tattooed for me will ya, I get to have my first taste Friday night after graduating. Love to all G'nite.

       Ranting on the right, labels to the left...  Ok this may not be understood by most because I come from a much different background then most, yes sadly, the religious right.  I shamefully admit I was a registered Republican, and big believer in Christian beliefs as the way to live your life. Well then I decided to stop beating myself up so much, kept my economic republicans beliefs, but became libertarian on social issues, and that is where I remain.  I believe in low taxes, and very little government involvement in folks lives.  I am a big believer in community based help and stewardship.  I know it only works in a utopia, but it does work to some degree.  I still believe in pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, but helping those who cannot, not counting on some government bureaucrat to do it, but for the community to.  Ahh the joys of living in fantasy land.   I cannot be a liberal though, liberals in power create labels, labels create excuses.  "Oh I can't learn like the other kids, I have dislexia or ADD" Bullshit I had both, and it made me work harder in school.  Both my sister and brother were kept back and babied because of the same issues, I excelled and if not for my own stupidity in falling victim to my trans label I could have been something better then I currently am.  Maybe this is why I hate labels so much, because I did eventually succumb to mine.  I am not old enough to have been there but I do know the words to Dr. Kings speech have been not kept up too by so many that embrace him.  He said he "dreamt of a world where children are not judged by the color of their skin."  Well how the hell does affirmative action meet his dream, it does judge, it says you are a minority so you are too stupid to do it on your own, let us do it for you.  I hate these labels, I hate the dependency lifelong politicians try to create to keep them selves in power as they encourage more and more to surrender to the fact that we need them.  I know this one may get people just a little rilled up, please note I am not a racist, I love people of every color gender, shape and size, and I do believe minorities don't get the same opportunities as us white folk.  The way to solve it isn't through forced acceptance of it, it is through working at a grassroots level to show folks people are just people, skin, gender, size don't fucking matter.  Ok so now I have exposed my feelings on politics and the fact I was once in the enemy camp let me tell the story I intended to.  I finally dragged my sorry ass out of bed about 8:45 this morning, man it was good to sleep for a change.  So I turn on CBS to catch the weather, and who but my old favorite Dr. Laura is on .  I lost most of my respect for her when she lambasted a poor FTM on her show a long time back, she told this poor person that she should have done this before she had kids, I was devastated.  I of course still listened for a bit longer, beating myself up, until she started getting really nasty to gay folk.  That did it when she called us(yes I am) gayfolk"biologically errors" , well let me tell you I wanted to shove my biological error so far up her... that, oh never mind, old male aggression dies hard.  So anyway this little stuck up thing is on telling Harry Smith that women should just accept there roles as men's sexual play things, and withholding sex from your man is abuse.  Ok little miss uppitty, I am not going through this whole big transition to be someone's concubine,and gen women shouldn't think like that either.  You may want to think of yourself as a nice warm slot to please your man because that is how god intended it hun, but the real God created man and woman equal, we changed it over time.  Relationships are give and take if both parties aren't getting equal satisfaction out of the situation it becomes nothing more than emotional prostitution, sleeping with somebody because you feel comfortable.  Women can do anything men can do outside of a few biological things, so shut the hell up and take your little submissive white ass back up to your McMansion and let your husband use you like the ho that you really are. I guess I am already the feminist, I don't take too much stock in what a "biologically fuck up" like Dr. Laura says, and sorry that I ever was part of that crowd.  I hope God and the universe forgive me. Love to all, take care, lets sing hymn 782 "sisters are doing it for themselves" as we leave the church.

       Rhetorical and such...  Had some pretty hard talks with Co on some big decisions tonight, also talked about the lawyer I found for an uncontested divorce. I am afraid to call and get a consultation with him, think this little problem may raise his fees slightly.  Not looking forward to when its final, my big failure.  When I die, and get to where ever it is that I meet my maker I have two questions for her. Of course I am young and not planning on going for awhile so there will be more I am sure.  Number one is " What the fuck is wrong with you to make people like me?  Notice it's not why me, as if I am the center of the god darn universe, but why do that to anyone?  Secondly is  Why does a thing so precious as love, hurt so much?   Maybe the animals are smarter than us humans pretend to be, very few species mate for life or mourn the loss of a mate, just eating and mating without fear of hurt.  As they used to sing in one of my favorite silly songs.  "you and me baby ain't nothing but mammals, so lets do it like they do on the discovery channel."    Sorry for writing so blue tonight both language and mood wise.  I am human and its hard sometimes.  Please don't think I am in a bad place, mourning is not bad, it is a necessary human emotion, we all need to just go with our emotions a little bit more, and tell them to a doctor like they are bad things to have a little less.  When did feeling and hurting become a disease?    Wow philosophy girl is back, better shut up before the universe gets pissed and sends me some bad karma for my sarcasism.  Love to all, G'nite.  My last preaching for tonight is  to be you and don't be afraid to feel things without feeling there is something wrong with you, its called living.

       For Co...  Writing poems for other folks still, well not fully on this one.  I wrote this one for co but not from her perspective, on my way up to pride yesterday between Manchester and Holyoke, I write quick.  Wasn't sure if I was going to share it or not, besides what most of you may think I do keep some shit I write private too, my writings here are just what I choose to share. Ok for my gal co, whose life I have tainted, and who I have "left behind" on my journey for wholeness.  Sorry hun.   Left behind..    As I walk down the wooded path I glance back over my shoulder, And see you stopped, Just standing there.  I miss you walking beside me, Holding my hand, As we made our journey Together.   I see you standing there, Alone, Afraid, Feeling Left behind.    I reach out my hand, And motion you to come along. You decline, Unable to go any farther. I pause momentarily, And notice the tear that rolls down your check, In perfect synchronization with the one on mine. I turn and continue walking, Having to go on with my journey, While you continue on your own path. Soulmates split by fate, Heading in different directions.  I pause every so often and look back, But every time I do, You are smaller and smaller, The distance growing between us. I wish I could go with you on yours, As much as I wish you could come with me on mine. I still love you immensely, I'm sorry for leaving you. Behind.

       Quick break...  Studying flavors needed a break, found something fun on a new friends sight try it, put in a word or your name and it creates a slogan.  Try the word pussy, and you get   "Your pussy, right away" wow sounds like a great advertisement for those Dr.'s in Thailand that ignore the HBISOC, and no I didn't put it in somebody did before me.  Ok here it is   urlLink slogan generator   Back to the books.

       More from yesterday, some from today...  Wow got my first sunburn on my cleavage.  I need to burn once early or else I just burn all year long.  Also got a bit on my shoulders, as I was going to hop in the shower I noticed something I've always dreamed of, strapmarks.  I am red all over and have those nice strapmarks I always admired for some sick reason.  I gave co her bumper sticker   "Straight but not narrow"  along with her shirt I bought from Teo.  She won't put the sticker on her car, but hey I bought enough for my car to cover the both of us.  I now have my rainbow pinstripe that I will put on if it ever stops raining, I also bought a funny one  "Jesus may love you, but I'm his favorite." for all my born again cousins.  I also got some nice pins, my favorite is  " Focus on your own damn family"   and " ask me, I might say yes."  Ok that one might get me in trouble depending what I get asked.  Hey as my old buddy Rhinegold Schlitz used to say "its nice to be asked, even if the answer is no".  I doubt RS would approve of my new life, but his attitude is good to continue to use.  Today was tough.  We had a bunch of tears when Chantelle said she missed daddy, and Co piped in that she did too.  It's tough sometimes to feel you killed somebody's Dad or husband but I could have done it for real, or kept part of him alive in me.  I figured part of Scott was worth saving, and I am glad I chose this route instead of the other.  I need to go study my drinks and work on the next group for tomorrow.  I also am posting a poem latter based on comments from Co and some personal discussions she and I have had.  Wrote it on the way up to pride, oh oh, hopefully not going to blue mood already, and starting to do the poetry shit again.  Life is too good, I had the balls to leave a bad job situation, take a chance on a new career, and I am learning a new skill.  Add to this that I am loving being out and proud, not scared and hiding the way I thought I would be, my new "balls" are bigger than my God given set ever was.  Fairer sex my ass, girls do in fact rule, and trannies are tougher then straights any day and twice on Sunday.  Anyone who disagrees can go live a day or two in some of our shoes, I am lucky to be blessed, most are not so fortunate, so don't judge us all by my stupid bravado and good fortune.  Love to all, take care.

       Proud from Pride...  Wow went to my first pride event today up in Northampton, it was fucking cool.  I have been way out in the world of straights, but it was cool to be mingling in the community.  I love to people watch and this was the place to do it, there were people of every shape, size and several genders there, gay,straight, bi, pan alone or a family.  The best thing was, everybody got to be themselves without fear of persecution.  It was so nice to see a young gay couple male or female holding hands or kissing.  It was cool to see the little girl and her two moms waiting in line for the bounce house. It was nice to see people express themselves however they chose to, of course I wish that guy with his ass hanging out of his shorts and no shirt on could have chose different shorts, but hey I turned away.  I just loved seeing all the different organizations, vendors and such.  I spent way too much money, pins, bumper stickers, jewelry, but the best money I spent were on t-shirts for a pal Teo.  Teo is trying to raise money for his top surgery and cannot work full time due to a terminal illness.  His shirts are cool and not all that detectable by straights.  For female to males the logo is "self made man" with a guy on it, for the male to females it's "It hurts to be pretty." with a girl on it.  I am not doing them justice and will try to post a picture of them soon.  It is for a really good cause, he is a great person who has been dealt a really crappy hand and has an attitude second to none about it all.  If you would like a shirt use the email me link on the right and I will forward your requests to him.  I need to ask before I share his email with the world, mine is set up for this kinda stuff. Please buy a shirt today, they are only $25 each, and they go to help a really nice, and cute guy.  It was cool to be with friends and to make new connections.  I am working hard to try and get more spouses of twenty and cos members to go to a straight spouse group.  It is my current quest.  I met with the gal who does the group and brainstormed for about half an hour over how to do it. I need to talk to Brianna and set up a time to have Jan come in and talk to the spouses, of course the hard part is getting them to come with us.  I feel horrid for the place I have put co into, and want to make sure there is support from others and for others like her.  Going to support group was one of the best things I ever did, it really helps, but it takes that first step of going to one that makes all the difference.  I can't help but feeling a little empty that the family wasn't there enjoying it with me, maybe the next one.  It was a fun event with lots of families there, maybe soon mine will be there with me, but I do know it most likely won't ever happen.  The price I pay, the baggage I carry.  Did lots of walking and talking today, got a little red from the sun too.  Time to kick back relax and have that drink I've been thinking about all week while learning to tend bar. G'nite and love to all.

       Blatant signs...  Ok another quick post.  Coming out of the bathroom this morning I hear a  thud  on my window, I go to check it out, and its a bird that flew into my recently cleaned windows.  I live up on the top floor apartment and my bedroom is kinda like a dormer so I have a roof right outside my window and poor Mr. bird is just laying there  yes Mr. bird, a female bird isn't stupid enough to fly into a window.   I figured I'd give the poor thing a few moments to get over the shock and most likely he would fly away, I've seen it happen many times when I worked at fotomat.  So an hour later I go back and check on him, he's still there, this isn't just shock.  Ok suns getting up in the sky, roofs getting hot, the poor thing is going to bake to death.  I grab a laundry basket to throw him in, and figure I'd go get him a cage and keep him comfortable until I could take him to the vet.  So I open my window and start climbing out on the roof,  I get close, but then he freaks out, and tries to fly away from me and falls off the roof broken wing and all.  Horrified I run down 4 flights of stairs and around the building looking for Mr. bird.  There are lots of bushes, so if he died in them I wouldn't find them.  I felt horrid, in trying to save something, I most likely killed it.  I wish the universe would stop sending me such blatant signs, I am smart enough to get it without killing things.    I really do believe it is a sign too.  I think I just scared off a friend by sending her  a poem I wrote from where I imagined her perspective to be.  It is a traight I learned when writting for Paul, and I don't like to do it, you feel weird doing it.  I just had to put my two cents in, she is going through a tough time, and I know I will have the same issues when I am where she is now.  I hope for two things, one that I got her feelings right, and two,(and more importantly) she doesn't hate me for doing that.  I am not trying to save everyone, in fact this friend doesn't need saving, only to hear that it's ok to feel the way she does.  I was trying to explain to her, I kinda know how she feels by writing down how I would feel if I were there.  Oh well, enough saving the world for a bit, don't want to send any other birds over the edge.

       Girls just wanna have fun...  Ok went out for the second time in two nights, just me and Ta this time, (hmm I might want to reconsider those two letters due to their other meaning),naa.  We just went down to Applebees after school and discussed the world, she had a mudslide I had a soda, since I was driving us, and we split a sampler plate, I never drink if I am going to drive,no if's ands or buts.  It is nice to be able to talk to someone openly about being me, but more importantly about other shit too.  Talking all trans all the time brings you down sometimes.  Its also nice to be able to hang out with another "questioning bi", with kids.  It will be fun to get our kids together to play and shit since they are close in age.  I love how I have made such a quick connection in a place I had not imagined I would.  Thank you universe for sending me another great friend, now send me something that will wake me up after two late nights in a row.   Off to pride with two other tall broads and a short dude this afternoon.  Funny I never imagined myself being able to go to a parade/pride event.  Of course, I never imagined: being able to tell my boss, work in the same industry,pass as well as I do, have people not get freaked out by me, be able to finally do it, get Co to accept me so well, etc,etc...  Things change, life is fluid for good reason, and sometimes you just go with the flow. Love to all, take care.

       A nice ride...  Took out my bike, which is actually moms bike she bought last year at a tag sale and never rode.  It's a beat up 18 speed mountain bike, but it serves me just fine.  I had a nice ride around where I live and even into the town over.  I did venture a little too close to espn and got stopped by a security guard.    UM ma'am are you an ESPN employee?   I so wanted to reply " don't you recognize me, I'm Chris Berman?" but I thought better and just said no.  He rudely barks  "This is private property, you can't be here."   I apologized and explained how I thought I was still on a public road since I saw no signs saying otherwise.  He quickly said " no problem"  and I rode my pretty little ass away.  I don't know what the big deal is, I love security guard mentality, and know what I speaketh, I used to be one 3rd shift for a major insurance company that shares a name with a state capital.  It was really boring work, and I got hooked on no doz to stay awake.  I had this fellow employee that constantly packed heat.  He took me to his house and showed me his gun collection.  It amazed me what this guy had.  This was before the assault weapon ban, he had uzis, magnums, all sorts of macho guns.  He also only weighed about 100 lbs, and I'm sure it must have been a sight to see him shoot the magnum or the other powerful guns.  He thought the guns made him more of man, he had that security guard mentality big time.  Anyway I ended up riding for about a 6 mile trip.  A nice easy ride, some small hills, trying to stay to the back roads as much as possible.  I did turn a few heads, this one guy in a jeep kept checking me out instead of the road, and it freaked me out a bit, but hey he can look all he wants, he ain't getting none from me.   Hopefully the exercise will help me sleep better tonight.  If so I will venture a little bit further tomorrow.  Also in a weird irony on the local fox station the friends rerun was the one where Chandler's boss was slapping his ass all the time.  I laughed my ass off at first and it was funny I guess.  A man slapping another's man ass is funny, a man or someone who is attracted to women who slaps a woman's ass is a pervert.  It sounds odd but there are lines and different rules for the different sexes.  I also called on an adult toy store today looking for some advertising from them.  The guy in front of me was buying some pretty damn offensive videos involving women tied up in some pretty nasty bondage sex.  I think porn is ok, but porn that promotes violence towards women or any group is not ok, and violent sex acts are nasty shit too.  So anyway after I snooped on what he was buying I found the manager wasn't in so I headed to my car.  Mr. Bondage fetish was getting into his car, the one with all the religious bumper stickers, choose life, prayer over protest, Jesus saves   I wonder how Jesus feels about hard core bondage porn?  I am hard to surprise these days, I have seen lots of weird shit, and yet me and my kind are the ones first to be called perverts, go figure.  G'nite and love to all.

       Wow has it really been that long?...  Looked at the calendar this morning and realized a few milestones.  Firstly I've been out of the hospital for a month, I think I've healed up mentally pretty damn good for hitting rock bottom so hard. I am not doing some of the dangerous shit I was doing before I had my breakdown, like driving 100mph on the highway or shit like that.  I have noticed I am a bit more unforgiving since I got out, and not afraid to talk more tough than before.  I'm not a violent person, I don't like to fight one bit, since an incident back in 88, but you'll have to read my book. It's also been about a month since I've moved in with Mom which has been another pleasurable experience indeed.  Mom and I have been good for each other, I've gotten her off the chocolate, she coaxed me out of bed when I was still a crying heap a month ago.  She loves me for me, which is the nicest feeling you can ever get.  Thanks again for all those who helped me move in and visited me in the hospital.  I also realized I have been living full time for 5 months now.  It has been full of more turmoil then any other time of my life.  I have been both higher and lower than ever before.  I am looking forward to my six month anniversary next month where I am going to burn some of my stuff from my old life I never wish to see again:my cup, a few old jerseys, old work shirts, business cards.  I have saved a stash of my old stuff for Co and the kids, just in case they want to be able to look back on when I was just plain dad.  I have found some interesting shit out over these 5 months.  You do get treated differently as a woman, it wasn't their imagination.  It's not ok to be treated like less of a person.  But I wanted to be treated like a woman and I can tolerate it ok. UNLESS IT COMES FROM ONE OF MY OWN. Doesn't mean I endorse it or embrace it, it is my lot in life. I have gotten an ok handle on my self image problem I think.  I have had gen women who don't know my situation, and some that do, say I am lucky because I am thin.  I am finally learning to see the thin girl in the mirror instead of the fat dude with thinning hair. I am finally starting to feel "real". In fact I learned yesterday that Co no longer considers me a man.  That was the most powerful statement I have heard out of her yet, and it made me both happy and sad.  I have much left to learn in this journey, but I am looking forward to it indeed.  Insomnia last night came with a plus.  I fell asleep round 10, woke up at 2.  That is a long stretch for me.  But when I woke up at 2 I got to watch a nice thunderstorm.  I love watching them, and I miss my old house, which was up on a big hill, so you could watch them for a long time.  It lasted a few minutes, and I watched tv until 3 when I fell back asleep.  I wish I could find out what is going on.  I'm limiting caffeine in the pm, I'm trying different pill times.  I think I am going to try and exercise in the evening and see if that helps next.  I would just love to be able to sleep for 8 hours a night for a week or two.  I did have another odd dream last night too.  I was pregnant.  Must have been supernatural, aka Rosemarie's Baby, cause I'm not really into dudes, not to mention I still have male equipment, and lack a womb.  The doctors and I were all worried how the baby would come out.  They decided on cesarean, but I wasn't asleep long enough to see the birth, thank God.  Don't know what it means, will have to check my dream book.  Love to all, take care.

       Still sleepless...   Holy insomnia batman, will I ever get to sleep again through the night?   Not any time soon I am afraid...  My insomnia is back on the high frequency end again.  I have had it for the last 3 to 4 years and have had bouts like I am now allot, sleep 2 hours, up for 2 hours, sleep and hour, up for an hour, and maybe sleep another hour.  This isn't healthy and will catch up to me.  I asked my endrochronologist, he claims the hormones shouldn't do that.  I am more in the thinking of stress.  I am still trying to catch up on bills, I am getting used to a new job, and Saturday wasn't a good day at 20.  On the way out a friend who I care for slapped/grabbed my ass in front of Co.  This has been hard on her as it is, she isn't even comfortable enough to call me by my new name.  And here is this more male than female guy touching her husband in a way men touch women, not cool at all.  I won't get into too much, but it ruined the whole night for us.  We still sometimes show our love for each other the way we did in our married life, even though it is much different now.  Mr. Happy aka my little birth defect is non operational due to all the hormones, so I can't do nothing, but there is something so erotic about getting someone else there.  Needless to say the whole incident took away her mood, and has her reconsidering going back.  This isn't a good thing, I was hoping that Co's presence might bring others out of the shadows and into the support group, it will take awhile, but it is a possibility.  I won't though put Co through needless pain to do it, and if my friends actions hurt her like that, they might not be friends for long.  In one of my short periods of sleep I had a dream.  I was in some sort of college for only the folks I went to elementary school with.  It was weird to say the least, but hey it's a dream.  So anyway I'm at my desk waiting for the prof to come in and my old buddy Lewis Eaton, the one who hit me w/ the line drive in little league in the jimmy, calls me snottily by my old name.  I freaked out, threw aside my desk and chair, his when he got startled, backed him up to the wall, and jacked his ass up by the throat.  I asked him if he had an issue with my new look, he meekly said no.  I squeezed harder as he turned purple and told him not to mess with me again.  I threw him to the ground in a heap.  I kicked him in the stomach for good measure and as I looked down it was no longer Lewis, but my good friend who pissed me and co off at the meeting.  What it means I don't know?  I know my friend reads this, I know her to be a good person.  I have left out her name deliberately, she knows what she did no need to humiliate her.  I hope she realizes actions have consequences, and to just take that extra second to think shit through.  Or else I will jack her up against the wall too.  She is a little bit taller and I can't exactly reach her throat, so I will have to find another handle.  I am not a violent person until provoked to be so.  I don't let people push me around much, and I have zero tolerance when it comes to someone hurting my family and friends.  I hope I don't have to show the ugly side of the Ash in awake time any time soon.  Love to all, and take care.

       It's going to be a long week...  I have shitty neighbors.  At least they are better than the ones JR has, no shit box racers.  Mine are total white trash, most days they are blasting some stupid classic rock, and they have 3 junk cars in the yard and garage, they let their dogs run free and shit in our yard,chase our cats,and they can't seem to get their kids to understand our yard is not their yard.  Other than "the little shit" they seem to be ok, until tonight.  Fucking fireworks.  It's not even July and they are starting already.  I hope they run out of fireworks soon, thank God you can't buy them with foodstamps.  I'm sorry for putting them down so bad, but I just can't stand white trash two bit pot dealing assholes.  I think I may have to pull out my Johnny Cash cd's and blast them this weekend, or maybe ABBA  instead.  And next time I find a "doggie mountain" in our yard I am putting it on their steps.  It's not the dogs fault, but the owners who don't leash them, so you have to go after the owners not the dogs.  I am not a total bitch, but hey I don't like when folks disrespect my shit like that.  Oh well time to try and sleep, plot and plan.....  Love to all, take care.

       First of all I hate blogger lately, this is the 3rd time in 2 weeks I had a lost post!!    Yes Virginia it is a wasteland...   Ok sorry for the cornball real title to my blog today, but it is what I felt when I was talking to  Mother Shel  the other day, and found out how naive she still is.  We got in a talk over how much of a wasteland trannyville is, she doesn't see it yet.  It isn't her fault she is new to the pack, I didn't believe it either.  I learned quickly otherwise.  It didn't matter that I had folks like  sister Jude , and others warning me about the landmines on this road, I had to learn for myself.  I gave poor Shel a long dissertation on how this is truly a wasteland.  I will share my feelings here, and hopefully won't have to talk about it too much more.  I am in a good place right now, but the grass always looks greener on the other side of that fence so come over and check out my lawn.   Firstly, to fully understand how tough transition is you need to realize how much it has in common with chemotherapy.  Both change you forever, they damage you greatly in curing you of what ails you.  They both almost kill most folks, and do kill some.  They both are not something one sane looks forward to,but are the last result in one of the toughest fights of one's life.  Even when things go good it is not a pretty picture.  Look at my own case.  Yes on the surface it looks like I have it made.  I have passing priveledge, I have a job, I have a relationship with my spouse, my kids, and most of my family.  Yeah it looks good but lets go over all I had to lose to get here.  I had to sell the house that Co and I worked so hard just to buy, not to mention all the hardwork that we put into it to make it our dream home.  I had to move 40 miles away from my kids to the only place I THOUGHT I could afford.  I can no longer peek in on their innocent faces as they sleep.  Gone is my loving relationship with my wife where we showed our love for each other through intimacy, replaced by friendship and celibacy.  Gone is my relationship with my own sister, and those like her that think I am evil incarnate for doing this to Co and the kids.  Gone is my relationship with my inlaws who for over 14 years treated me like one of their own clan.  I have lost friends who were once like brothers to me.  I had to quit hockey, which was one of my biggest loves for fear I would be found out and beaten the hell out of.  I lost my career, and much of the respect I had earned in becoming the top producer in my company.  I drove myself into bankruptcy, from lack of employment, trying to keep too much of my old life, and trying in vain to pay off my bills early.  I lost my mind for a short time, and ended up in a psych ward.  I lost my apartment, I now have to live with my mom.  HELL YEAH AIN'T MY LIFE GRAND !  Maybe I should be the new poster girl for recruiting new trannies like the homophobes think we do.  The saddest thing is that  mine is a success story.   I am not selling my body to survive, I have a roof over my head.  I do have a family that for the most part still love me.  I don't do drugs or drink to make my troubles go away.  I have a job.  I didn't kill myself.  I walked out of that psych ward healed, and sane.  I haven't turned tail and run back to my old gender when stuff got rough.  I have a mom that cares enough for me to give me a place to stay and a shoulder to cry on.  I have friends that love and care for me, and who truly like me for me.  My wife is my best friend as painful as it is for the both of us.  I get to see my kids without a court order to do so.  I still have a plan to get through to surgery.  Yes I have had a very rough time through the wasteland, and I am not through yet, one never gets through totally.  But yes Virginia, this is a wasteland, welcome to the show..     I know that this isn't as good as Trish's warning page, but it is my feelings none the less.  It doesn't really matter how much the Judes, Trishs or anyone else warn folks, nobody listens anyway.  This unfortunately is something you have to learn for yourself.  Love to all and take care.

       W.W.Y.D?...  Ok time for another what would you do question...  Yesterday I was coming back from the vending machine for the second time in the afternoon, when one of my co-workers saw me eating again and commented " Eating again Ash, what are you pregnant girl?"  I was a little bit flustered, but answered her anyway.    So here is the question:  A co-worker asks if you are pregnant...What would you say?  A. "Yes it's ______'s" (insert gay office worker's name or Michael Jackson) "he doesn't know yet." B. "Yes it's the bosses, shss it's earning me a promotion." C. "No honey you have to have sex to that happen." D. "Yes I was abducted last month my aliens, it's a hybrid." E. Say "no", and run off crying.  Of course as always I went with "C".  I am a smart ass but even I have my limits.  I know this question leaves allot of you guys out, but I thought it was funny enough to have to share it with you.

       Oops,so much for total stealth at work...  My boss and I had a little talk today, she actually figured my little secret out over the weekend.  It wasn't anything in particular, but just the fact the few times I talked about how I was separated from my "spouse" instead of saying husband, and the fact my kids don't live with me raised her suspicions.  I guess the topper was when I leaving in a hurry last Thursday she asked where I was off to, I told her I had to do some volunteer work. She of course had to ask what kind of work?  So I simply explained I was going to lend "peer support" to folks who are going before a board for evaluation.  I left it very vague, if someone had said that to me, I would have figured drugs or alcohol abuse, but she put it together with the other clues, and had an epiphany while seeing a tranny story on TV over the weekend.  She admitted at first she was a little upset by her discovery, but got over it by the time she came back from surgery on Wednesday.  I apologized for the charade, but went back over things and showed her I never lied, she appreciated my honesty.  She doesn't want to talk about things, know about my old life, or ask me anything.  She would rather just forget that she knows and just treat me as plain old Ash.  I promised her I would keep it hush, hush, and she would too.  I did leave the offer open to have her ask any question she has, she claims she won't which is cool. I love the fact I she is treating me like everyone else at work, that is what I want out of life, to be treated like everyone else. I am excited that I can just be plain Ashley for a change and not have to worry about a past life.  I still am a bit worried that she will develop a problem with it, or others may find out, so I will have to watch my conversations with other co-workers.  I am glad that I don't have to worry that she will flip out when she found out, she knows, she's cool with it, and we go back to real life.  I don't know why I keep catching breaks, maybe I am charmed, or maybe it's just my honest "no nonsense" approach. I don't invent elaborate cover stories to blend, I just watch what I say, so when folks find out they don't feel as lied to as if I had told stories.  I am a bit of an oddity an honest salesperson, that of course is the secret of my success, shss, don't tell...  I also went back to the Christian book store and met with the manager. He was very smug and treated my like a second class citizen, and took a really bad attitude with me.  I don't think it was much my stickers, you couldn't see them from where I parked, and I don't get read much by folks, so I doubt it was my issues.  I am pretty sure Mr. Wonderful just has an issue with women.  I am not bitching about it, it comes with the territory, I want to be treated like a woman, and dammit some men still treat us like shit, that is life.  I am not going on a crusade to change the world, I don't like being treated that way, but it isn't the end of the world.  Men like that are small minded, and not likely to change their minds anytime soon on women.  It would be nice not to be treated like that, but hey I need something to keep reminding me how much more I like being with women more then men.  Some dudes may be cute, but honey I really need a woman in my life allot more then a man, not to mention I haven't met a man yet that can make me forget about women.  I do realize that I may not ever be considered a real woman by some communities, but mainstream society tends to treat me as such.  I am in a group that has historically been on the outside looking in on the community, but I am not doing this to win any popularity contests, nor do I care what folks I don't care about think about me.  As far as the way society treats me, as much as it sucks to be treated differently as a woman, it is at least a sign that I am blending well.  God will deal with the chauvinists when they die, I've got bigger fish to fry right now.  Believe it or not there are fights that even I cannot win.  I also am not entirely comfortable speaking out on women's rights when I still have a penis,and technically still a man.  I am not proud I was a man, but I had about as much control over that as I did in my skin, or eye color. Yeah I got a bad draw in the lottery of life, but it is better than others, so why bitch?  Love to all, and take care.

       What was he thinking?...  Ok my first post on this subject was zapped by the Patriot act so I will try again, I hope I remember all my math.  Today  I came across an estimate on the cost of the war in Iraq, they listed it at about $186 billion to date.  That doesn't mean much to most folks.  I had to go look up how much a billion is and found out it is 1000 million. So the war has cost so far $186,000,000,000, that allot of zeros.  Of course that doesn't mean much to most folks, so I thought I could shed some more light on things.  The Christian children's fund says they can feed a person for $24 a day.  There are roughly 291,500,000 people in the USA so we could feed everyone for about 26 months.  Could you imagine not having to pay for food for 2 years.  Of course we would be living on rice all the time, but it is only an example.  Of course there is the simple figure that it is costing us each $640 for the war, that doesn't sound like much, but that is every man woman and child, I have two kids myself and Co so that is $2560 we have paid for the war.  I would like a refund please.  To talk to those in the trannie community, there are roughly 6,314,000,000 people in the world, and 1 in roughly 12,000 are trannies so there are roughly 526,000 of us in the world.  With the money we spent on the war so far we could pay for SRS, FFS, electrolysis,liposuction, breast implants for all the trannies in the world, throw them all kick ass parties, and would have only spent half the money, that thought sickens me.  We could also pay for 342,465 years of round the clock electrolysis, ouch.  Back to the striaght world, an average house in CT cost around $200,000 you could buy 930,000 people or every 3rd man woman child or someone in between in CT. a new house for that money.  There are 7 million people in New York with that money you could give each of them $26,000,000,000.  I bet they still couldn't afford to have a car in Manhattan even with the extra money.   Ok the dead horse has been beaten enough.  There is not much we can do about it until November anyway, please remember this when you go into the polls this year.  We have had our money foolish spent to fight one man's war, and we need to make sure he doesn't get the chance to do it again.  Until then enjoy figuring your own stuff out that we could have paid for with the war money we spent.  I did work a long day so I hope all my math is right, if not thank the schools that taught me my math skills and think how much better that money would have been spent teaching better math. Love to all, take care.

       Onward Pagan soldiers...  Ok so I'm not a real pagan nor do I hate God, I just hate his fan club.  Today I couldn't resist calling on a Christian book store in my territory.  Of course I parked my car so my gay pride stickers and my "Jesus loves you but I'm his favorite" on my car were clearly visible from inside the store.  I was pretty sure I wasn't going to get the account but I just thought it would be fun to go in.  The sales girl looked at me like I was Lucifer himself and I half expected to have her break out the super soaker full of holywater and start soaking me.  She was a little bit kinder then that,  she was cold but no preaching at me or telling me how evil I was.  The manager wasn't in, and I will go back and try to sign up the account, not to mess with them, but maybe just maybe to reach out a bit.  I am not going in saying who or what I am, but if they figure out my orientation by my stickers, maybe they will see we ain't all evildoers.  Win them over one at a time, killing them with kindness, that is the Ashley way.  I was going to try out for a new reality show they are filming down in Middletown about bartenders.  I am sure with my status I would be a shoe in for the show, trannies=ratings.  I really don't want to come out in public right now, I am enjoying the stealth life, and I don't wish to give it up yet.  That time will come when I publish the book, for now I am enjoying the peacefulness of appearing to fit into society.  It is a double edged sword when you make your private life public.  I may indulge you guys with bits and pieces of my life on this site, but I am only giving you the bits I wish to share, and there are like 5 people reading this site anyway, so who gives a fuck? This is how I choose to live my life right or wrong I am comfortable where I am and where I am going.  I hope I can keep up the good work and keep my soul doing it.  So sorry no tv right now, maybe latter on, but for now I will stay in my small pond and under the radar of straight America.  Love to all, take care.

       One month and counting...  A month ago today, well by date, I did one of the stupidest things I have ever done, ok except for voting for W.   I hit rock bottom that Friday May morning and got halfway through committing suicide.  I don't like leaving things unfinished, but I will make an exception on that one.  I really don't know exactly what sent me totally off the edge, I am just glad that I figured out what I was doing before it was too late.  I wish I could say it was the darkest time of my life, but it is nothing compared to when my son was in ICU at just 10 days old and I thought God was punishing me by making my little dude sick, those days far outweighed last month.  It still was a scary time for me, I truly didn't care for about 20 minutes whether I lived or died, I was at some odd peace.  I have a new type of peace in my life.  I have examined it greatly in the last month, and trust me there is allot of living I have left to do, and shit I need to get done.  That being said though, if I were to be taken off the face of this earth today, I would have no regrets.  I have experienced much in my 34 years here.  I have felt unconditional love, I have a soul mate, I have better friends than anyone else I know, I have experienced so much life I am thankful for.  It is odd to have a peace like this at my age, but I don't play by any certain rules anyway.  I would miss all the folks who have made my life so wonderful, but the pleasure of having them in my life has brought me great joy.  I of course would not get the pleasure of having a female body, but the joy of being treated like one is so fucking awesome it really wouldn't matter.  I will be getting surgery one day, and I am going nowhere soon, but it is how I feel now. Of course there is the issue of missing out on some certain extra curricular activities I still wish to try with a whole list of folks who will remain nameless for there own good.  I made a list of my accomplishments when I was in the hospital, and even I was impressed.  I have done allot in my life, everything from saving a few lives (1 drowning, 1 choking), to performing on stage, and  having sex in a hot tub.  It might seem vanilla to some folks but I am really happy with all the stuff I have done over the years indeed.  I am so grateful for all I have in my life, and all that is to come.  It seems so odd to me that I had to almost loose my life to appreciate all I truly have.  Yes I lost all my money, yes it will take me longer to get surgery, yes I am lonely in love, but these are all so temporary compared to death.  While I wish I saw this before, in some weird way, as my friend Tanya put it, I needed to have a breakdown to purge all the stress.  Wow she can make a mean martini and has good advice, somebody better hire her soon as a bartender.  Whatever the reason I am glad I walked through my fire, and while I didn't pass this test with flying colors, I still walked out alive.  I haven't come out totally unscathed, I have some holes in a normally strong memory, and odd feelings every now and then.  I thought I was going nuts tonight when the TV kept changing channels on me, until I realized one of our tenants got a new dish system today, and our remotes got crossed signals.  Man I really hate technology sometimes.  This isn't a time I will look back on too fondly other then the fact I made it through ok.  It's a shame our esteemed Govenor couldn't come through the same way too.  It's about time that snake got his come up ins.  It really couldn't happen to a better person.  I still won't go back to being a republican any time soon, but at least there is one less bad example in office.  Now we just need one more administration to do the same.  I also realized today my big boss, our publisher, is a bit rough and annoying.  He seems like a nice enough guy, but he pissed me off today,he just kept trying to pile more work on me.  It sounds odd, but it was good to see I am not dreaming, but indeed still alive.  He usually leaves well enough alone, but my boss was out getting a lump or two removed from her breasts today, I hope she is ok, she is a nice lady and will be in my prayers tonight for sure.  This whole breast cancer shit scares me to death, my aunt had a bit removed last year, and mom has to go to have some lumps get a closer look at tomorrow.  Neither one of us is really able to handle another big dilemma in life right now, and I hope God and the universe are listening, and that she will be just fine.  I hope I never have to deal with the issue at all, but with my family history I highly doubt it.  Have a great night, and love to all.

       Father's day wishes...  Today is a weird day for me.  I am still a father, and I always will be, but I am not a typical or normal father.  I have stressed countless times that I am not my kids mom, Co is, I was there, I still have the mental images burned in my memory of the whole process.  I am my kids maddie, not quite mom, not quite dad, but something special in between.  My kids and Co each made me a card for fathers day that referred to me as maddie.  I love that they finally have a name for me, yet I still feel guilty for "taking away" their dad.  It beats the alternative I guess, but at times I still feel bad.  I got one of the coolest presents too.  When Co and the kids came over after mom and I cleaned at her second job for 4 hours, my son came running over smiling saying "maddie" over and over and gave me by far the best hug I have had in such a long time.  It lasted for over 30 seconds and I actually started to tear up from the happiness such a simple gesture brought me.  It was a different fathers day weekend but nice none the less.  To all of you dads out there, no matter what you are, happy fathers day.  To all you kids out there whose dads are no longer with us, I hope you have found memories of your dad so that they may live on in your memory.  I am looking forward to week 2 of the new job.  So far it has been fun, I know some day the honeymoon will be over and it will become a bitch, but I am enjoying every second of bliss right now.  I forgot to mention a conversation I had with my new boss last Thursday about name changes. We were talking about my brother being able to enter a contest the paper was holding. She asked, "did you change your last name when you got married?"  "Not me, I kept my last name." I told her.  "Good for you, I wish I kept mine" she added.  OMG I don't know what she is going to do when she finds out my true story.  I haven't lied to her once, but the way I have answered her may be seen as dishonest by her.  I am half wondering if she does know and is just fucking with me.  Only time will tell, if she knows and is playing with me, I applaud her, and am humbled for not seeing it.  I met moms boss the other day, and he knew about me beforehand, and when he met me and shook my hand he backed up about ten feet.  He was looking at me with a perplexed look on his face,  I thought he was freaked out about me.  Come to find out when mom talked to him the next day, he was shocked I looked so feminine, I guess he expected the big dude in a dress look.   Hey be careful boys, you never know who is natural and who is "new and improved"  or just "undergoing construction" like my current status.   It is funny how I do get accepted by some folks who have no clue.  This little boy at the bank was trying really hard to flirt with me today.  He was very interested and was trying way to hard to impress me and make me laugh.  I wanted so bad to do the voice drop, but I do need to play nice.  I can see why some women hate men like this little guy, I really didn't hate him as much as pitty him.  This guys life is that bad that he is hitting on the likes of me, while working in a bank in a super market on a Sunday.   HMM, a date  with a mid twenty something guy, who works in a supermarket,where do I sign up?   Sorry I just have to laugh a bit, I don't fit two mold of most folks minds.  I don't look like what they think a tranny looks like, or a lesbian either.  I have been getting some more weird look though since I got the tats.  It so amazes me the whole thing about perception in our society.  Just because I have a tat some folks think I am a heathen now, of course they are probably closest to the truth.  I would love it if folks could just accept folks for who they are in the inside instead of what they look like on the outside, ah to dream....  Also working with mom yesterday I jammed my hand big time between the big old motorized floor cleaner and a door-jam.  In all my pain I came up with a new profanity laced interesting thing to shout  "Donkey ass, monkey fucker"  I am not sure what it means, but that stupid machine that crushed my hand and split my knuckle open was one at that moment.  Thank God mom wasn't in earshot, but if she was, I'm sure she would have just laughed her ass off at my lame swear.  My hand is ok, and now I have a new thing to shout in times of utter pain.  I always had wanted to try and operate that big old walk behind zamboni looking floor cleaning thing, now I regret it.  Gotta drop those old male curious feeling about machinery. Love to all and take care.

       Strange days indeed...  First of all I fought valiantly against the stomach bug that co, my son and mom had but finally got sick today.  I hate missing a day of work the very first week, but there are somethings you just cannot work through, and projectile vomiting is definitely one of them.  Last night went and did the greeting part for 20 at the gender clinic and I cannot believe what happened.   I was trying to calm down a friend who was going for hormone approval, when someone pulled in I knew I recognized immediately, but wasn't 100% sure where from. I made a little comment to a friend that "she kind of looks like the girl who calmed me down when I was here last year."  It took a bit longer to calm my friend outside and we went in.  We both kept looking at each other, when I finally had enough and told the mystery woman she looked familiar, she said the same thing.  So I went through the normal, "where are you from, live, work, etc?"... It became apparent right away she was one in the same.  We both laughed in recognition.  She had been here last April to get approval for surgery, and was back to get more up to date letters.  I was so happy to see her and exchange new numbers, she lives right around the corner from me.  This is such a small and strange world.  What the hell are the odds, that she and I would meet again in a place that people usually don't go more than twice?  I am glad I had witnesses because nobody would have believed me otherwise.  I am also glad I went, I had a feeling I needed to go, and there was a good reason to.  I can't wait to hook up with her, she is such a nice person, and I will be eternally grateful for her calming me down so I didn't jump out a window, like the cowardly lion.   This journey keeps getting odder and odder to me.  When I look back to all the little things that just happened the right way to bring all the lovely people that have so enriched my life, it amazes me.  I am so grateful for all the little things that have made my relationships with all those special folks in my life.  This was all meant to be, for some reason God and the universe have orchestrated a really weird symphony that has brought us all together.  I hope I can enrich all of their lives as much as they have mine.  Ok gotta go pray to the porcelain god again.  Love to all, and take care.

       Babies n bathwater...  Ok I mentioned last week my flaming a couple of reformed trannies who are trying to tear down the whole HBISOC system and outlaw SRS.  While they are pretty much far gone, and really screwed up they did have a few good points.  Even Hitler had a good idea w/ the VW bug, yet he was a madman.  HBISOC has some flaws in it, and they do need to be fixed.  I know it is scary to folks trying to get through an already tough system to get through without adding to it, but I feel we need to have more maintence and check ins.  We all need some time to check in, you can't always do that in a support group, and some are too proud to make a special appointment when things get a bit bad.  But lots of bit bad things can become a little NB like yours truly had last month, or even worse.  The nuts I have been emailing throw around junk science and the word of their god like they are experts on both.  Forgive me for using "their god", I think they are misguided in what they feel god feels.  My God doesn't hate or tell folks to go around harassing or killing people.  Mine is a God of inclusion and love for all of us.  I think my last email to these folks happened last night, I have grown a bit tired of their recycled mantra over and over.  I will not reach them, and I am tired of being accused of being violent and abusive because of my passion to stand by my beliefs, and stick up for my community.  It has been fun, and while I did say I was going to share them with you, it would take up too much room and too much of my time to folks who need to go away, instead of staying out in the limelight.  Have a great day, love to all, and take care.

       Take me out to the ballgame...  Ok at work my boss came up to me this morning and offered me an extra ticket to the skybox of our local minor league team for tonight's game.  I am so still a jock at heart, and I haven't been to any thing since I started my rlt. Oh did I mention the free food part?  It was such a blast to go to a sporting event again.  Of course I got to feel the joy of waiting for a stall, ah the joys of joining the female team.  It was interesting, and I did get a few odd looks, not because I was made(I hope) but because I was in my business attire, and today was a short skirt kind of day.  So here I am 5'8", looking kind of thin, in a blazer, spaghetti string tank, and a short skirt and heels going to watch a minor league baseball game. NO wonder I turned some heads.  I'd look too if it were me.  I blended well regardless, and the folks we took to the game were very nice to talk to.  One claimed I looked familiar to her, I hope she isn't a reader of this site. It was nice to just sit around with the women in the group talking about art and theatre while the boys were out in the heat focusing on the game.  I did get a little too much into the game and had to admit I played little league.  I didn't get into the hockey part, I didn't want to go there.  "Yeah I played a little baseball, there were some other girls that played too." Was my response to my comment on how 2nd basemen don't hit they field.  It was nice to be accepted as a woman in that space.  This has been a really cool two days overall, I hope the wave goes awhile longer.  My boss and I hit the road this afternoon, and we got in a few odd discussions, one on how some male customers are still chauvinistic in our area.  I love being including in these discussions but I feel a bit odd still about them.  Somehow I feel a bit like an outsider joining the party a wee bit late.  We also got into a discussion on voice and height.  My boss has some nasty throat thing going on and her voice is hoarse, to the point she sounds like one of us.  She mentioned that she has a normal voice that is a little on the deepside like mine, but her mom's was deeper than either of us.  She also commented on my height, she is the shortest at 5'6", her mom and sisters were all 5'8".  She commented on how lucky I am to be tall, it makes me stand out from the crowd a bit.  One day I am just going to loose it with her, and just piss my pants right on sight.  All the shit I fret about everyday I go out she tells me how lucky I am to have.  I am waiting for the day when I am a little fuzzy and she mentions how lucky I am to have facial hair.    I just want to fit in, and for the first time in a very long time that is happening.  I feel at such peace, with the world, with my job, and with my self.  This job is not a very high paying job, but the stress level is so nice from what I am used to, it is hardly there at all.  I know I have only been there a few days, and I have only had to deal with a few deadlines, and as I get into it, I am sure it will get stressful.  It has a nice family type feel to it, it doesn't feel like just a workplace, it has good vibes.  I last worked a job like that back in the 80's and I stayed until she sold the business.  Once I latch onto a place it is hard for me to leave, unless they decide my being trans is too much for them, and have me leave for my own good.  Need some sleep, Love, take care, and G'nite.

       An old friend in need...  Just found out tonight an old friend from my days in church youth group has Leukemia.  He is relatively young, just under 30 has a wife and kids to boot.  I feel so badly for him, and am topping it with the sorrow that I know I cannot contact him to send my love.  I can't go back to that part of my life, I have been rejected/ostracized by the Lutheran church  and not wanted back at all.  It was bad enough I was raised Catholic and converted to a new religion, but now even they don't want me.  This is a part of my life I have lost touch with almost completely except for one of Co and I's very understanding friends.  Of course her mom says I'm burning in hell, but who cares?  My friend may accept me into his world, but why risk him getting stressed out during this time in which he needs all his strength to get well and recover.   So I am going to do the only thing I can for my old Friend Jaime L.,pray, and ask anyone who believes in the healing power of prayer to do so too.  I don't fully believe in the power of prayer as much I believe in the power of positive energy, and thoughts sent to one in need. It is the same as prayer but a different name.  So if you pray, make wicka circles, meditate, channel you Chi, leave your body and travel to suck the disease out of folks, ask the voices in your head to help,or even if you sacrifice chickens, please do so for Jamie's health and recovery.  He needs help right now, and we can always bbq the chicken afterwards.  Love and thanks.

       Working with out that 50lb rock tied round my neck...  Today was day one of being stealth at work, finally just being Ash the woman, instead of Ash the tranny.  OMG I cannot explain how good it felt, I can't explain how nice it was nice to be called ladies in a group of women, and shown the ladies room without a snicker involved.  It really was nice to be working without a 50lb rock tied around my neck, I was able to do it before, but I have also moved big rocks weighing over 300lbs by my lonesome using levers, and neither were pleasant.  I can see why some folks consider the whole stealth thing, and leave all the baggage behind of the tranny wasteland.  I am new to the community, and the one lesson I have learned countless times, is never say  ever, always or never, but I don't see myself ever leaving the community.  It is an important part of what I am.  Will I be marching in parades or be out to the straight world? Most likely not, but I will be at support group and keep myself available to anyone willing to listen to a nut.  I will continue to go to pride, and I will be out as a lesbian.  I am a woman who likes women and that can be my public face to those I choose to let in.  Who knows, with the turmoil I have gone through these last 2 years, how much I have changed and such, maybe I will become a hermit of sorts.  I really don't know and can't ever say for sure, life is ever changing, being stealth feels good for sure, but I do have a "family" I still want to see in my transbrothers and sisters, there is still much work to be done.    I feel so comfortable at the new job, it is a good happy atmosphere to be working in a liberal workplace where we can talk about how bad GWB and the rest of the evil republicans.  I have found nice folks to discuss a need for change in government, without having to bear my soul why.  I hope this one works out, I can see myself here for awhile, and with all the change and turmoil lately, this girl could use a little stability.  G'nite and love to all.

       "Your either with us or against us"...  Infamous words from GWB shortly after the horrible aftermath of 9/11.  At first glance I agreed whole heartedly with this stance, until I learned that when he said "us" he really meant his own feelings, not that of the whole country.  I won't delve into this whole subject again and start flogging the proverbial dead horse, but I find it amazing how the whole community of the religious right has started using Georges mantra.  I have found 2 "separate" sites online via judes site that claim they cured their transexuality through prayer and religion.  It is amazing that they both spout off so much of the same shit with the exception one is a Jew, and one is a Christian.  Their mantra's are pretty much exactly the same, they speak the same bullshit story.  If they wanted to go live their own life after a failed transition I would send them some good wishes and shed a tear or two for them, but when they start assaulting a whole system since they got the short end of the stick so to speak, I will fight them to the end.  I hate when folks use religion to spread hatred or their own agenda, somehow they have spoken to God and in some weird coincecidence he feels the same way they do.  I ran across folks who hear voices lately, and they were all under medical treatment, maybe these folks should go.   I do love to battle the "religious" folks, they know so little of the very same bible that "set them free", that it is child's play to battle them in their own arena.  I used to be one of them, I studied my bible to find the real answers, they have been fed a line and a little bit of carefully picked bible passage to get them onboard.  I don't know where my exact stance is on the whole western religion thing, but I so know that if what I was raised to believe in is true, then I will be just fine.    This leads me to another thought on this subject, if the whole western belief is right, I know who these fervent "Christians" really are, agents of evil.  They are so hateful in their speech when one doesn't hop on the wagon and drink the koolaide, they are so mean to folks that they are afraid of.  These are things an evil force would do, not a loving God.  Jesus never harassed anyone but holier than though religious zealots, he hung with hookers, and other low life's, but again they don't read the whole thing.  I ran across another one of these lovely folks last night while doing something on another screen name.  I thought it was a friend playing a joke at first, I have some funny friends, but to battle that long, I doubt anyone has the stamina or the balls to keep it up for that long without caving and laughing.  This person just im'd me out of the blue on a name that contains "trans" in it.  How this person found me, and what their deal was, hey I don't know or care, but man was it fun.  They started off "strong" and fizzled quickly I will share some highlights with you.  My "friend" stacey as she called herself will be in italics I will be bold.    repent for the Kingdom of God is near.    Cool is it.... I talked to God and he warned me about you...    really what did he say...    Beware of the evil one pretending to speak for me he will try to lead you astray in my name...    I'm NOT the anitchrist...    Like the antichrist would admit it?   we went on back and forth for a bit until I grew bored with them, I did get in a few digs before leaving and blocking them.   Jesus died on the cross for us.    Yes ALL of US...obtw Jesus may love all of us, but I am his favorite...    ...I will see you in hell, I hope you don't too upset when Jesus kicks your ass to hell, and you burn with all the other born again hypocrites...   To which I followed by blocking them, I don't know how they found me, when I asked why she was bothering me, she said because I was trans.  To this I asked "trans what? Am I into transportation? Trans-meditation? Trans-ams? Or Trans-oceanic ballooning? I wasn't battling Ms. Thing to reach her, I was just having fun with her.  I really think though that there is evil afoot trying to make my transition just a little more difficult.  Any God wouldn't hate the transition of a mopey distracted soul into a slightly better, less distracted soul.  Only an evil force that feeds off misery would want a person to stay the way I was.  What ever it is, who ever they are, I am not afraid to take you on, I will not back down, nor will I let your hate go unrewarded or unnoticed.  Ok enough of my crusade for today, I have a job to go get ready for, "oh it's a good feeling to know your alive, it's such a happy feeling, this feeling inside, that makes you wake up ready to say, I think I'll make a snappy new day...." Yes I do miss Fred.  Love to all, take care.

       Relationships...  This was a weird weekend for relationship type stuff.  I did lots of stuff with Co who used to be my wife(ok she still is technically) and realized how much of a great friend she truly is.  It is so amazing to me how our relationship has metamorphisized into what it first started as a great friendship.  She came with me to my old companies trade show, she came to me to Twenty, we did some other things, but it felt so good to be with her again, and I am getting ok at not doing the couple stuff.  I was told countless times how lucky I am to have her still in my life, and I truly am.  It was not an easy task for either of us. It was hard for her to give up me as her husband and for me to loose her as a wife.  But we both were open enough to try new avenues for relationship.  We are no longer what we were before, but something new, even better I feel at times.  Do I miss being a couple?  Yes, of course, probably as much as she does.  We have been friends for so long though it isn't funny.  I still remember the cruise we went on back in 89, It was a eventful trip.  It was my first and last time performing on stage, and there was so much love triangle shit going.  I was after Co's best friend and my best friend was after Co.  Who ended up spending the night together and had a really great evening?  Co and I, no hanky panky, just two friends trying to figure out life in general while eating some good food, getting some sea air, and having some adult beverages.  I loved those times, and that's what we are back too, really great friends who happen to have kids together, and still like to do other stuff too.  On the other side of things my brother and his boyfriend ended things today.  I feel bad for them both they are both great people, and I hate to see anyone hurt.  I won't get into it at all, because its none of your business why they split, but it was a hard decision for my little brother to make.  Mom and I went over and helped him move his shit out today.  It was hard that his roommate (who was his boyfriends last straight relationship) was there at the time.  I hated the atmosphere of hurt that hung in the air it was like oily smoke choking me out of the room.  I hope they both do well, my bro's boyfriend is a good guy who needs to find himself, and my bro ain't perfect, but he is my only brother, unless my sister has a little secret.  Like I said earlier Co did good at support group.  She didn't get much support out of it except that she could go to a place where it was ok to be the spouse of a tranny.  She did not have to hide or worry about the next inappropriate question about her kids father.  I hope she comes back soon, I know the others treated her very kind.  Co was even concerned that others might be hurt because she was there and other wife's weren't.  I told her it was ok if she got help out of it, and maybe others would start to come since she was going.  Who knows?  I am so beat today, mom had me mow the lawn this am, I haven't had to mow since last September before we sold the house.  I went to help her clean, we hit the grocery store, went and helped Shawn move, and after that went and helped dad spread a few yards of mulch.  Boy thank God I still am in shape.  Last night was a short sleeping night too, Jacob got sick and was doing that 4 foot long projectile vomiting thing.  I used to be such a pussy that I would puke when my kids did, now I am pretty different considering he sprayed my sandals and foot with nice warm puke and I didn't even gag once.  It was pretty cool that I could stomach cleaning it up too, I guess I have changed allot in some aspects.  Tomorrow is my first day back in the job arena, it will be an adventure I am sure.  I will let you all know how it goes.  G'nite and love to all.

       You CAN go back to some people, some of the time...  Ok so I did go back to my old male companies trade show last night, several of my old coworkers nice and not so nice check up on this site, and I wanted it to be a surprise.  I had originally planned on making a scene before I thought better of it.  I read on a new site I saw from JR that reminded me that we need to be a little more respectful then revolutionary sometimes.  How did I loose focus from a path I had been on before of trying to be just a member of the mainstream than the lunatic fringe?  Hey I'm just human and got caught up in basic emotion from being screwed over, and of course I wanted revenge.  Instead of throwing on a really short skirt and low cut blouse, I just went in capris, a button up blouse and sneaks, far from strutting my stuff.  I had intended to go up to my old boss and a few of the old school tripods and give them a big ole kiss on the cheek.  Instead I was dignified and walked in shook hands, talked to folks,and walked out with class and dignity.  I got back to basics by being strong not in freaking people out, but by showing them I am not afraid, I do belong, and I am anything but a freak.  This tends to screw with people more, they can't hate you when you don't give them good reason.  I went up and saw allot of old faces and they saw my new one for the first time.  I shook hands with my old boss, a few other ex sales guys, and even a guy who I pissed off so bad he won't talk to me.  I was standing there behaving and everyone else was shaking my hand, so he was compelled to do it too, I love the me too mentality when it is for something good.  I have to admit I really freaked out a few folks just by talking to them.  One guy looked like he was going to cry and wanted to go wash off my germs after shaking my hand, and talking to me I could read the disgust and discomfort on his face and in his eyes.  One of my old bosses wives was there and OMG she just about passed out when meeting me, it must of been my striking beauty, yeah right.  Everyone else was cool if the recognized me at all, and lots of folks didn't even recognize me.  I even had an offer for some part-time work for weekend work for one of the dog foods.  I don't know if I will take it or not, but it was nice for the offer.  My old boss was ok, shook  Co & my hands quick and kept moving said goodbye to me and to "ahgn" which Co was ecstatic to be called.  This is my old bosses MO so busy that when he leaves like that one is not offended, he isn't being rude, he's just busy.  It was nice to hang out with the girls for just a bit, but we didn't hook up to go gamble like we had planned.  That's ok I had really good company in Co.  We couldn't stay long as we had about 3 rolls of quarters between us, but it was a blast still.  I enjoyed going out with her, but it is so weird going somewhere with her and not holding her hand.  I was an old fashioned romantic, I loved holding hands, and other little public signs of affection.  Now we cannot do that without making one hell of a scene.  Overall it was a great night, went back saw some friends, showed others I am not a freakshow, and had a great time with my best friend in the world.  I also found out a side effect of my pills is that I am no longer afraid of heights, pretty weird shit.  We also had a really silly conversation on the way home, but I will save that for another day, I won't that one slip Co.  Also Co is coming to twenty today to lend support to me,and to just meet folks.  It's nice to have her give a shit enough about me to come, and that she has the balls to go.  It will be interesting I am sure.  Love to all, and take care.

       WWYD...  Ok I'm bringing back my take off of WWJD and presenting you with a tougher question then the last one.  I hope you enjoy answering it as much as my little bro Shawn and I had creating it. Here's the question  I have for you... Someone comes to you and offers you $20g's to act in a porno.  It's all safe sex, no body multilation, nothing too freaky like sensual unrination/defecation, no animals, or dead people.  It's just plain porn, gay and or straight.  You need the money, would you do it? A.yes and I would enjoy it. B.no way. C.yes, but I wouldn't be proud/keep it to myself. D.yes, and I would brag about it,and buy copies to give to my friends. E.yes, and I would try to get my significant other involved for some added fun.   LET ME STRESS, THIS ISN'T A REAL LIFE SITUATION QUESTION LIKE WHEN I FOUND MOM'S PORN, IT IS STRICTLY HYPOTHETICAL, UNLESS YOU ALL KNOW SOMEONE WILLING TO PAY THAT KIND OF MONEY TO SEE MY SKINNY WHITE ASS ON FILM.   I of course go with C myself, I would do it, but I wouldn't be bragging about it.

       Taking the easy route...  Well I did indeed have two pretty legitimate job offers that I had to pick from today.  One was a job much like I was used to, just selling advertising to little business for a local newspaper.  This is my specialty, building relationships with businesses and helping them grow.  The money is livable, but on its own surgery would be in 2006 at the earliest.  The other job was a managerial position, high pressure, always on call, no life of your own ever.  You would have to carry that little beeper that could go off any day and at any time.  The pay was excellent more then I used to make before.  Working this job I would get surgery next year for certain.  I had quite a dilemma, go for the bucks and the hard work, be miserable for a year, not have a life at all, but get surgery faster if I didn't burn out,on one hand.  Or take a lower paying job that let me have a life, let me enjoy and mentally prepare for a surgery that even though I want, is none the less lifechanging and hard to undergo.  I surprised myself and took the easier job.  Why? Mental health, stability, and the value of my life to me.  I know that someday I will get to have the surgery, to that there is no longer doubt.  Why put myself through hell to get there?  Why over extend myself and do a job I've done before and burnt out on just for a faster finish?  From what I remember I have told many people the journey is not the destination but the time getting there.  There is lots of stuff I would like to experience and need to experience while pursuing this quest for oneness.  I can't just focus on the end of the trip, there is so much to see on the way.  I can always get a second or third job to help speed things along. I am also not a super hero, I am a human being going through more shit then most people go through, and the added stress of that sort of environment would not have been healthy for me at all.  It's good for me to able to admit my weaknesses and not be afraid I will be looked down upon for them.  Gone is the shame I would have felt if I still felt myself to be a man.  It's ok in society to be flawed and female, we are the weaker sex supposedly, I want to be treated as a woman, so I am going to enjoy one of the few fringe benefits women get in our society, and just be ok with not wanting to take on too much.  Not to mention I have my bartending training, I have connections for other jobs.  This way I can work on my terms, when I feel like it, not having to be a slave to a high stressed job.  I may seem silly to some of you, we live in a society that is so impatient and so dependent on money that we forget the important stuff in life.  Do I miss making gobs of $? Hell yeah, I had some fun when I had $, and I would love to have gotten surgery yesterday.  The thing is I have enough common sense to realize that sometimes we must take a path that is a little bit longer to reach our goals.  What would happen if I burnt out from the stress of higher paying job?  Would I end up with another NB, would I do something stupid, and would/could I come back from another one?  What good could come from burning myself out?  I could get surgery and be so emotionally drained from all the high stress of things that I could have ruined what ever life I have left.  I thank the lack of T effecting my brain for my clearer thinking, or maybe it's the fact I am being me more then it is chemical.  Who knows or cares?  I am sure of two things, A. this is the right decision at this time, and B. the old me would have done it the other way.  I guess I have grown up some, and become the responsible adult I always knew was there inside me after all.  Thank God that I am done having to be a man, be tough, and do the hard things all the time, instead of the right things.  Wish me luck in my new job, I start Monday am.  Love to all.

       Loss of another American Icon...  First a president, now a great musician.  Yesterday passed the great talent of Ray Charles.  I know what you are thinking, I'm a little young and a little pale to be into Ray Charles.  I was raised in a household where skin color did not matter.  We watched soul train and good times as much as we watched he haw, and the osmonds.  We lived for a good amount of time in the projects, my friends where a rainbow of colors and races, so I am not a stuck up whitey suburbanite.  This being said, I only liked a few of Ray's works, I was more into Stevie Wonder and James Brown, but Ray made an impact on music and for that he should be applauded.  I also love his version of America the Beautiful, what soul, what feeling.  I am wondering who is next as these things happen in 3's.   I do have a wish list of course, but in the time of the Patriot Act I think I'll keep it to myself.  Actually in all honesty I wish death on no one.  I do however am hearkened back to the death of one of my female hero's Katherine Hepburn just a short time ago. Maybe she was the start of the group of 3?  She was a great actress, and she showed great strength, dignity, and poise.  She embodies how I hope to act as a woman in society.  Notice I said a woman not a tranny, wow I really think Trisha got to me big time.  I am not ashamed to be a tranny, I will always be, but if I fail to act like a woman, why go through all this?  My goal has always been to become whole as a woman, not screw with folks heads and slay dragons for the rest of my life.  I know most folks feel this way AFTER surgery, but I learn quickly, and I am farther along in this journey then people give me credit for.  I am not going anywhere soon, and I do continue to fight.  I'll just continue to fight like I do everything else my own damn way.  I am trying to live my life the best way I can, not for anyone else but that gal in the mirror, while leaving the earth a better place in my wake.  It's a hard balance, but I think I'm doing an ok job so far.  I had a change of plans for tonight, and it is for the better.  Co is tagging along with me as we go on a trip to say hello to some old friends.  I love it when life just makes things happen in a fun way.  Love to all and take care.

       A nice dilemma to have...  Wow finally a hard decision between a couple good things, now that's a change.  I got an offer to go work for the first job, for the feminist gal.  She is still very impressed with me,and told me the folks she talked to about me had only the nicest things to say.  The other job looks promising too as my source who told me about the job was told by my potential future boss that he was impressed also.  This second job though is the one that involved the background check.  I had to hem an haw about it and after a quickie little discussion with my oracle(JR) I came to the conclusion that I should tell him the basics about my past, not my whole life story but just a quick fact or two.  So I called him and said "Artie, I know you guys are doing a background check on me. And I wanted to warn you about a little something that might come up."   " Uh, uh like what?" he replied.  "Well Artie, I used to work under another name... and uhm...well to make a long story short, I used to be a guy."   "Well I don't see why that should matter to me, I don't care about your personal life, I just care about how you can work." He kindly replied.  "I really don't go around talking about it much, so I'd like to keep this between us."  " Not a problem if it comes up in the check as an issue I'll help you deal with it then."   He finished. OMFG I was impressed to say the least.  I thought for sure I would be asking for trouble, but all I got was at least on the surface acceptance.  He may feel differently, and an easy way to tell will be the interview with his boss tomorrow am.  If he truly is ok with me, it will be polite, if not it will be harsh.  I told him about the other job offer already and that I need to decide by late tomorrow am.  He is going to try and push up the background check to see if it can be done faster.  I really think job #2 is the better opportunity, but I won't throw away another definite job for the hope of getting it.  I have tempted fate enough lately.  I am glad to have one job offer, now I may have two.  JR jokingly asked if I was trying to make "all us mortals look silly".  I won't try and explain good fortune anymore than my bad fortune from 3 weeks back.  But then again I am still alive, so maybe that bad fortune was good fortune in disguise.  Maybe I needed a breakdown as a good friend pointed out today to purge all the crap out of my system.  Maybe hitting rock bottom finally gave me the solid footing I needed to start my climb back up.  Who knows, who cares.  Just a big thank you to God and the universe for all their kindness, love and intervention.  Not that she reads this I am sure, but a big happy birthday to Jude's beloved Alixe.  She is good people, and is not afraid to speak her mind, I can see why Jude likes her so much.  Someday maybe I will get myself into a relationship like they seem to have with each other.  It is so nice to see two people so truly happy in an arena of misery.  They made lemonade with their lemons, and I applaud them both, and wish them both many happy years to come.  Oh and Alixe if you are reading, this soccer mom bitch sends a big birthday flip off to you, with love of course.  Spent lots of time working on the book, got up to 1987 before hitting a wall in 1988.  I will stop for now, the next 4 years of that time were filled with such turmoil of a on again off again transition filled with family feuds, primal love making, drunken fights,love triangles gone Springer, and a bit of homelessness mixed in too.  Those were the days......I have seen much in my 34 years indeed, much more then I ever wanted to for sure.  Goodnight and love to all.

       Loud mouth, rage and a bad tude...  Shit I got a problem again with my mouth and my road rage again.  I have been catching my sarcasism and my use of profanity rising again.  Such behavior is not fitting to a nice young proper lady as myself.  Yeah right.  I've been calling lots of straight men marry as an insult, I've started swearing in front of mom, of course she does it too.  The thing that is weird is my use of the p word.  I never used it much before,now I use it allot.  I think I started using the marry name to cut down on my usage of pussy.  But this morning I was stuck 2 cars behind a big propane truck and the idiot in front of me wouldn't pass the truck on straight aways, he was too busy smooching with his girlfriend.  So what do I do? I roll down my windows and start yelling  POUSSY, POUSSY, CAN'T YOU GET YOUR LITTLE SHIT BOX TO GO POUSSY?  HEY POUSSY, POUSSY, BITCH GOT YOUR BALLS?  WHAT'S THE MATTER CAN'T YOUR SHIT BOX GO FASTER?   After that I just yelled out the  HERE POUSSY, POUSSY .  When he turned off I flipped him off and yelled more non-sensicle profanity at him.  I need to go blading soon to get rid of this pent up aggression or I need some sort of release.  I am working on getting up the courage for a sort of release that I wasn't considering before,and we will leave it at that.  Oh well I gotta go, maybe on the road if I come across any more idiots who can't drive I'll tell them you all said hi, in between my heckling them.

       Hello panic my old friend, it's good to be with you again...  Ok so I'm no Simon or Garfunkel,  but I love that song, and a bit of panic has returned even though I am sure it will be temporary.  I went to observe dispatch at one of my job prospects this morning, it wasn't fun to get up at 4:45 when I was not getting up to get paid, but I did it anyway.  I went down, all went well, it wasn't really any big deal what they were doing, I am used to really high volume high pressure shit from when I worked at Agway and you were so busy on a springtime Saturday you couldn't pee or even eat until after 3pm when you came in at 8am.  This girl can handle being busy for sure.  The thing that has me a little bit panicked and worried is the background check they are running on me.  I love having to put down that old name.  I cannot wait until 2011 when I will no longer have to legally list or mention that name again.  I have no regrets on what I was, I just don't like having to explain it to someone in which it doesn't matter. I will already have to explain it to anyone I get in a relationship with for the rest of my life, I don't think its my employers business of what I used to be.  All they need to care about is can I perform, and will I be reliable and work my ass off.  I hope where I end up working I stay a long time so I don't have to deal with this shit anymore.  I am reverting back a little towards the stealth aspect just a bit.  I have done the totally out at work tranny thing and it got old repeating my life story to everone.  I want to still do outreach, just not in a business environment and not every damn day.  We all fluctuate in our comfort levels in this journey, right now I'm laying a bit low, staying off the radar, and quite honestly and maybe selfishly concentrating on my own damn shit, doing it my own way for a bit.  I'm driving again and for awhile I'm sticking to the paved roads and out of the thickets for just a bit.  It's healthy to not over extend one's self, I have seen other folks dragged down into despair much like you can sucked down saving a drowning person.  But you can't save the world if you can't save yourself, so why try to?  I'm also waiting to hear back from the other job today, last I checked she hadn't checked my references so either she was bullshitting me about how much she liked me, she liked me so much she isn't going to check, or she is a procrastinator.  I hope to find out for sure today.  Tomorrow is supposed to be my interview with the east coast manager for the job I went and checked out today, so I will let you all know, asaik.  Love to all, take care.

       Pomp and ceremony...  Watching President Reagans body being brought into the capitol to lay in state.  It was pretty moving to see how frail and alone Nancy looks right now, whether you liked the man or not we all feel a bit sad at how Nancy lost Ron, they were soul mates who reminded me alot of June and Johnny Cash.  I did not get moved to tears, but I did get goosebumps when the battle hymn of the republic was going as they ascended the west steps of the capitol.  It is weird to see service men carrying the president in a coffin instead of a president putting our service people into them.  Wow where are these coming from tonight?    Mr. Reagan was a good man, who I felt kept me and the whole country safe back through the 80's but what do I know, I was still Catholic back then.  I may no longer be a republican, but then again Ronnie was one only in name, but not in the true spirit of the party line.     May God keep you and grant you rest Mr. Reagan, and may he bring comfort and take care of Nancy for the rest of her days.

       Interviews, Flaming Idiots, Getting Denied, and driving around a dead guy...  Such is life in the land of Ash.  Started out today with a very strong interview, I most likely will be having to choose between two jobs, but I am pressing on making sure I have other options opened to me.  I also flamed this idiot I found off of Jude's site, click her link on the right and check out this freaking idiot who blames HBISOC for having regrets about getting surgery.  I love this modern time of personal accountability.  I skipped over rollerblading for today and will go Friday instead, so JR if you are up to 2x in a few days it will be good weather.  I went out and picked up some tickets I won from a local station for a baseball game, stopped in to grab some want ads from JR, and then dropped off Paul, or more precisely his ashes.  His daughter wanted me to bring by his ashes, mom has had them since he died back in March, and now his family all of a sudden wants him.  MY guess is so mom can't have him, he kids were freaking ingrates, I saw the man more then they did and he wasn't even my dad.  It was pretty fucking weird to be driving around with a dead person in the car, but it wasn't like he was going to hurt me or anything, he had been returned to dust like we all one day will become.  When I got home there was a bad letter from unemployment, my claim was denied.  I am not happy but I am appealing the decision, I deserve it in this case, and while I hate taking state aid it is necessary and due at this time.  I am supposed to hear about both jobs tomorrow, and then I have a busy Friday planned, rollerblading in the am, going to meet up with some old friends in the pm.  I was very tempted to go to my previous company's trade show( from when I was still a male) but I don't see anything good coming out of it, except a little closure.  I will go back and slay those dragons someday, I just don't know when.  On a brighter note, I love summertime, and I noticed something odd while driving Paul to his daughters.  I came upon a stoplight and at the other intersection was one of the most beautiful butches I have ever seen.  I am not into the real butchy kind of girls I like them a little softer, but OMG she had it going on.  Her short hair really complemented her face,she had beautifuly sculpted arms that looked like she either worked with her hands, or worked out, the way she looked so comfy on her Harley, her whole attitude and confident aura around her screamed beauty.  I'm sure if little old me approached her she would most likely beat me to a bloody pulp, but hey its ok to look I guess.  This is a new experience for me, much like when I noticed I liked tall androgonus WNBA type women. It's almost as weird as when I felt attracted to Tim Mcgraw, ok but not expected at all.  Maybe my tastes are changing a little, I think I have more than enough time to figure it all out before I start dating again, and its nice to like different things I guess.  I will try to post my letter to the idiot latter on tonight for your reading enjoyment.  See ya.

       Two weird dreams, and a compliment...  Ok I had two really weird dreams last night.  The first one involved my grandmother or me-me(pronounced ma-may)who has been dead 12 years this coming November.  She was alive still, and living in the apartment she lived in when we were kids not the one she was living in when she died.  She was very confused by me, and the dream was basically me trying to explain the whole Ashley thing to her.  Nothing bad happened except the dream ended without me being able to get her to understand her new granddaughter.  The second one involved a conversation I had with my GP the other day.  We had a deep discussion during my visit about my mental health during transition, including options for surgery due to pending financial situations.  I told him that if it were going to be 4 years or more in my budgeting, I would opt to get an orchiectomy as soon as I could afford it as not to tax my system from all the hormones.  He piped up, "are you sure, you know it's irreversible?"  I told him that was the point of the whole thing, I so wanted to add a "duh" to the end but I kept it adult.  So anyway I dreamt last night that I had the orchiectomy, and six months latter the little buggers grew back.  It was very depressing indeed.  I don't know what either dreams mean, except to lay off the chocolate cool whip pie before bed.  Also was trying to help my little bro with math yesterday.  He was doing graphing for algerbra 2, and I was lost.  I did give him a pep talk on if he wanted to teach he has to get through it just like I have to go through rlt to reach surgery, and neither are fun.  We also talked about some other shit going on in his life, and he gave me the best complement I have ever received.  He called me an "inspiration".  I questioned what the hell he was talking about, and reminded him about my hospitilization. He piped back"yeah you fell, but you got back up.  You refused to stay down.  That makes you an inspiration for me when life gets tough."  I never intended to be a role model or inspiration to anyone except maybe my own kids, but it is nice to have my little bro say this to me.  He is an inspiration to me, for just being him and not caring what the world thinks.  Oh well another interview today, this time with a referral from a friends husband.  I hope its one of those things that if I get hired he gets a bonus.  She is a good friend, and her husband therefore must be good people to since my friend has high standards.  I would love to get a job, and help them out by him getting rewarded for finding me.  Wish me luck.  Love to all, and take care.

       Job Ho!...  Not a job as a ho, but a job none the less on the horizon, so hoist up the jolly rodger, adjust your bandana, get your saber ready and try like hell to land that bitch.    I had a really good interview today, I am 99% certain I have a job, and will find out for sure on Thursday after she checks out my references.  She told me point blank she liked my confidence and my assertive nature.  She is a little bit older and a bit of an old school feminist.  We discussed how women have to work harder then men at stuff.  OMG it felt good to be included in that group, and be appreciated for my brashness.  While I did come from the land of the tripods(as the girls at my old job called men) I never had much privledge.  I may have been an ultra tough and rough competitor on the hockey rink, but in the business world I was just a small little effeminate type beta male.  I had to work very hard for all I got, since I was smaller and not as masculine and aggressive as most guys.  I got shit on quite a bit, and took more stuff than I should, so I guess I know a little bit how it feels to be treated like a second class citizen already.  I have always been a feminist, now I get to be one as a female.  It is a good feeling.  I will let you all know how it goes as soon as I find out.  I am also continuing to look since I am not 100% sure of anything.  Love to all.

       It must be tough...  I keep getting this comment from folks on how tough it must be to be going through stuff, on how hard it must be to go and look for work, and just adjust to being a woman after being a man so long.  I don't want to make it sound like a joy of any kind, but this is the easy part.  Living as a man all those years was the hard stuff, now I am free to me, and it is pretty cool.  Even though I have lost many things, I have gained the peace of congruency.  I can't explain how much the turmoil hurt beforehand, and the joy I get from just being me now, but it is pretty damn neat.  Oh well I have to go for my interview, off to sell the world on Ash again.  Eventually I will get it right and become a contributing member of society one day soon.  Love to all, and take care.

       Wow you've changed a little...  Went to see my Gp for the first time as Ash today and got the comment that makes up the title tonight.  I felt a little uneasy with the staff,but over time I'm sure they will come around and warm up a bit.  On the way in I ran into a girl I went to High School with. I was scared shitless that she would remember me and say something, but I only went to that school for 2 years since we moved there my jr. year, and didn't make that many friends.  I felt very uneasy about having to explain this to folks I haven't seen in a very long time, and hopefully won't have to any time soon.  Afterwards I stopped at Stop n shop to grab some apples for snacks and as I am getting back into my car up pulls next to me someone who I went to church with.  What is God trying to do to me, kill me, or just send me into panic attacks?  She looked at me with a puzzled look on her face, and almost asked if she knew me.  I could see it in her face she knew me, but wasn't sure from where.  I knew her quite well for a bit, believe it not, I used to teach Sunday school and was quite active in the church. I kinda doubt they would want me to teach now.  A few really cool things happened today too.  First I have an interview tomorrow for a really great opportunity.  Secondly I got co to kiss me really quickly in the parking lot of the Dr's office.  I shouldn't be the type to kiss and tell and it wasn't anything like tongues in the mouth, but it felt good to kiss my wife again.  I miss kissing and she was good at it.  Thanks for the kiss hun.  And thirdly in the same plaza as Stop n shop I noticed a new store coming in Quiznos. Yes there is a God.  Also got some good pics back from walmart today, I won't post them since they involve my kids, but I assure you if you know me and I see you, you will see them.  Gotta go get prepared to do the interview thing again.  G'nite and love to all.

       New stuff/Old ways...  It was a weird day yesterday, I did post some pictures of stuff, enjoy the Scott shot while you can I won't leave it up too long at all.  I just had to share it after finding my POS digital camera and it was on it.  I got to go help mom do her second job yesterday.  Mom has been working 2 jobs since I was a kid, she doesn't have much education so she really has no choice but to do so.  Yesterday was the cleaning job at a local manufacturer.  OMG the place was huge and the work was pretty hard, I need to not only get a job soon, but something good enough that mom doesn't have to do that kind of work any more.  It was interesting going into a men's room after such a long absence, even if it was to just clean it.  I also reverted a bit back to old ways.  I went out of the house with NO MAKE UP.  Now for me that's is a true sign of the pending end of civilization.  I topped that though by wearing one of my old favorite male sweatshirts with a hoodie on it.  I looked pretty freaking butch, but I was going to clean an empty building not go on fashion patrol.  I was a little nervous when we went to stop n shop afterwards but I did fine and not a single head was turned to look at "freak girl."  Maybe I am becoming "REAL" finally.  My sister is a little princess who would never go out like I did, but most women don't really give a shit some days, I had my first real day like that.  I am more than a pretty face, and I don't need to be all made up to be a real woman at all.  It was a pretty fucking cool feeling to have, and a nice thing to finally realize. I wish I had done so sooner.  Also talked to JR's pal about the pet food job for over an hour + last night.  For now I am just doing consultant work for him, but if all goes well I will become his sales manager down the road.  This feels right, and it is weird how I met him not through my usual pet food network, this may be Karma again.  I hope so, he and I seem to be so on the same page when it comes to how a business should be run, and the importance of having a great and honest product to sell.  I can see why he and JR remain friends.  Today I also go to my GP for the first time as Ash, it should be fun.  He knows about me, and has another trans patient already.  I am just worried about staff more than the good Dr., and it is weird to go to such a space that was so Scott for many years.  He has been my longest lasting Dr. I can remember going to him with no insurance back in the late 80's and early 90's a scruffy and gruff guy, now I'm just a little different.  I will let you know how it all plays out.   Back to looking for work.  Love to all, and of course take care.

       Last minute invite...  Got a call from JR last night as I was about to start supper inviting me to go to the GLBT film fest at Trinity last night.  I needed a night out and she had a free ticket so why not.  It was fun to get out and see a couple of movies that were good.  I got to meet someone I only knew from emai in person who was also showing a film she helped make.  Unfortunately for her and the audience there was some equipment problems and her hard work got messed up.  It was nice to meet her finally, and I feel bad that her movie didn't work right.  The main feature was pretty cool, it was about this little missionary man who goes out to LA to spread the word of the Mormons, and this little gay boy who is shallow and lives by the one night stand.  It was a cute love story, even though I felt a little bit uncomfy with the sex scenes, I'm not into man on man action, sorry, kisses are ok to watch, but I'm not into the male body so I don't enjoy seeing 2 naked on the screen.  It was tastefully done though and didn't spoil the movie for me or anything.  There were a few scenes that were tough to deal with due to their closeness to things that have recently gone on in my own life.  I cringed more than a little,but it didn't really bother me that much.  I am stronger than I thought, and JR had to ask me if I was ok too.  I must still look fragile to her or something.  It's hard to explain how I feel now, but I have been in some nasty car crashes over the years yet I still watch NASCAR without flipping out.    I thought after I "broke" I would not be the same person that my fire would be gone.  I am finding though as I heal I am better and stronger than before instead of worse.  I got tempered in the fire instead of burnt up, and I am thankful for that.  I lost faith and thought I was forever singed.  I have my scars from the ordeal and will always remember them, and hope to never go back.  Overall it was a cool night, it was fun to just go out and hang with JR, and of course as usual we got called ladies again.  I usually never get the ladies comment in groups , so its a nice feeling to go hang out and not feel that 2 trannies amplify our signs of our past lives and draw attention to us more.  I may try to go make it back to see another night of movies with another group of friends next week, but I need to make sure $ is there.  Love to all and take care.

       The Greatest Generation ever...  I am a firm believer that the generation that had to deal with WW2 was in fact the greatest generation ever.  I have constantly looked to the hardships they endured and thought how it must of felt any time I have had to deal with something hard.  I would then laugh at myself and feel guilty for stressing out over something so trivial when they went through real hell.  My family has a little bit of military history in it, but all in my dads generation.  He and the 3 half brothers he had that I knew all served. Dad volunteered for Nam, in the Army, Uncle Henry served state side during Korea, Uncle Adrian served state side for so many years it isn't funny, and then there is uncle Lawrence, the hero from WW2.  Uncle Lawrence was a quiet man, and never spoke much about the war the few times I met him, but he passed shortly after we found out Chantelle was on the way, and the stories his family told were incredible.  Turns out Lawrence fought through the battles of the North African Campaign,and then into Italy.  He got as far as Anzio, that is where he became the hero.  During fierce fighting an enemy grenade came into their little area and my uncle took it upon his self to try and save his fellow soldiers by getting rid of it.  Unfortunately it went off a little too close, and he left some flesh in Italy, and the explosion left some metal that remains there in his leg.  I admire his selflessness and sacrifice that he showed in his brave act, and am happy he got a chance to live life after.    Today though marks the 60th anniversary of the start of the end of the last necessary war.  I hate war, and think it is awful how we trivially send our young people to die for no real purpose other than leaderships personal vendettas.  This though was to eradicate pure evil and hate from taking over the world.  Many died and sacrificed with their lives so that we may live in a world that is a little better than when they got here.  They have made it possible that there are not many necessary wars anymore.  I want to thank and pay tribute to all those who lost their lives 60 years ago today on a beach thousands of miles away from home, to all of those who fought evil, and to those at home who sacrificed too.  I hope for all our sakes we will someday stop having to fight wars, but if we do we know where to look for inspiration on how to do it.

       Tribute to the great communicator...  I used to hide the fact that I was once a registered republican and proud of it, not any more.  I feel that the best way to heal is to admit what you are or did, and deal with it.  I have made apologies for voting for the worst president in my life time or any other life time our current "clueless leader", but I will never make excuses for admiring the best one, who passed yesterday.  Ronald Reagan was more than the great communicator, he was someone who stood up for what he believed in, and had a way of doing things the right way.  I remember times in the 80's fearing that the Russians were going to snap and just launch missiles at us any day.  Mr. Reagan found a way to start ending the cold war not by sending young men and women to die for a personal war, but through the fine art of showmanship, and brinkmanship.  I bet he was a fierce poker opponent.  I also feel he was a blue collar republican, he was of the party of Lincoln, not the party of the rich and elite like the last two republican presidents we have had. He may have been a republican in name, but he did many things for us normal folk, and would most likely have fit in the democratic party side of things, but hey nobody's perfect. I will miss you Ronnie, you did many a great thing.  And Mr. Kerry it is now up to you.... Go win one for  the gipper...

       Ok I love a bargain...  Went down to a tattoo parlor that came highly recommended to me today with my phoenix idea.  The owner was awesome and we came up with a really nice original design together.  While he was working on the phoenix I looked around at the different work he had on the walls.  I fell in love with this little blue and purple butterfly.  When he finished I asked him if he gave a break for multiple tattoos, showed him the one I wanted and he gave me a great deal.  I got a decent sized(roughly 4"x3") custom designed  tribal tattoo and an off the shelf 50 cent piece sized butterfly for only $120.  It wasn't as painful or even the kind of pain I expected.  I thought it would be like electrol pain of being stung by a needle, but it was more like a burn then a prick.  I didn't bleed much at all, and the guy was so nice it wasn't funny.  I highly recommend them and if anybody wants more information on them send me an email and I can fill you in.  Have a great night, love to all, and go get some ink it feels pretty fucking good to do.

       Me thinks it's time for ink...  Well the time has come, I am finally ready to take my first step into the land of the tattoo.  I have been wanting one for awhile and actually came up with a tribal design idea of my own for a phoenix while in the hospital.  This last little bit of my life has really been a cleansing fire for me, now its time to rise up and be renewed.  My name means to rise from the ashes, just as a phoenix, we both have been renewed.  My second tat will be a butterfly, but that is down the road. For now I need a reminder of the hell and the fire I have just been through.  I also went and saw my Dr. from the clinic last night, and all is pretty freaking well.  We talked at length, and worked through some shit, and basically caught up.  I am still on schedule to be approved for surgery in Jan/Feb 05, now I just have to work the finances back.  I wish I hadn't tried to be a good girl and pay shit off early like I was still working, it was very foolish in hindsight.  I have also decided to publish the book after getting approval for surgery instead of after surgery.  It is hard to understand if you haven't been there, but I always thought I would feel like a real woman after surgery, you don't.  You start to feel like a real woman when society treats you like one, and baby I'm there.  I cannot explain the joy of being maamed on the phone, or having a gentleman hold the door for you, or catching some dude checking you out.  Now if we can get a nice girl to check me out, you know maybe a wnba player or something.   I never imagined some of these silly things would ever feel so good.  But I also don't wish to stay in the middle too long, so as soon as I get the $ its peel that sucker and stuff it in their baby.  Gotta go get some ink, love to all and take care.  If I can find my POS digital camera maybe I will post pics soon of the new ink.

       W.W.Y.D.?...  Ok I'm sure most of you are familiar with the silly expression What Would Jesus Do? AKA WWJD? People would ask this in present day situations and think how Jesus would handle it. I find it fascinating that the same folks who worship a God who is by their own admittance far superior to themselves think that they can act in the same high regard and to the same standards as he did.  I really never understood this about religion which is why I am a hybrid spiritualist.  I believe in God and refer to her(actually in my world she's a hemaphrodite) in a classical western way.  But I believe it is more like an eastern way where the collective love and energy from all us souls who inhabit this universe gathers and amplifies the effect of Gods love more.  It is a chicken and egg thing, did God come from love, or did love come from God?  I think that God was born of love, we were born from her love and not wanting to be alone.  God does not spite, or curse good people, shit just happens sometimes to good folks, and karma happens when the universe is watching.  Karma is the souls in the universe on a higher plain watching you and screwing with you or helping you according to how you live life on this plain.  Ok enough philosophy and discussion on my beliefs.  I titled this WWYD?  What would you do for a reason.  I am still getting settled into moms place and came upon a problem/question I thought would be fun to share with you all.  While helping clean out an old entertainment center filled with old tapes I come across a few choice adult titles.  So here is my question.    You've recently moved in with mom and stumble upon her porno collection...WWYD?  A.File them alphabetically for her B.Destroy them and when she gets home read the story of Sodom and Gommorra from the bible to her. C. Put them back in the pile, way in the back and don't mention it. D. Wait till she gets home, and watch them with her, and make some viewing suggestions from your own stash. E. Take a hockey stick and beat myself in the head until I forget ever finding them.  Please let me know via comments what you would do. I just went with C on this one.  This is a new weird experience for me, but not that long ago when my brother was using my dads computer he found his stash on computer porn to.  I guess I have some pretty open/active parents now don't I?  Love to all,and take care.

       Ok I'm back, no really, I'm serious this time...  Well contrary to popular belief and vicious rumor I  still human .  The events of a few weeks ago showed me and others how much and humbled me greatly.  I won't go into full detail yet, I will however in my book, I actually wrote over 42 pages of journal I will share when I finish the book,which will be sooner than latter.  What I will share with you is that I lost all hope, all focus, and all my strength and ended up in the hospital and then the pysch ward.  I am not crazy, I merly fell the wrong way off the razors edge we all dance upon in this journey.  Lucky for me I landed right when I hit rock bottom.  Being in the psych ward was more life changing than the consequences that brought me there.  I was so low, yet my fellow patients were even lower, they had no chance or hope of ever being normal.  I felt for them so much and felt deep pain after making connections with them in their up times only to be crushed when I saw them gripped by the bad effects of their mental illnesses.  They are   not bad people, they just had something break or happen so bad to them that they are gone into another world I was brought into if even for a short while.  It was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do.  I was stealth to all the patients, yet the staff knew.  Could you imagine what would have happened if a patient found me out?  My safety and the whole wings safety were at stake while I was there, it was no option but to pass, and it was higher stakes than I was used to, nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide.  I did fine though and even had a fellow patient get sweet on me, and told me I looked like princess Di. It wasn't all bad, I have a way of making the best out of many a bad situation.  The highlight of my stay was playing pictionary, one has not lived until you've played pictionary with folks who hear voices and see shit that isn't there.  I cannot find the words to do justice to the whole experience yet, but let me assure you it was really freaky and outrageously fun once you let yourself have   fun with it.  Special thanks to my family, Mom, Shawn, and Dad were all there, and my lil sis even called me, wow I am special.  I also want to thank Co for not going off the deep end herself, and for being the rock this time.    Sorry for the added stress hun, thanks for visiting me so much, I know gas isn't cheap yet you came as often as you could.  .  I also need to thank Sister Jude, and Mother Shel(religious not family) for visiting me, bringing me stuff, giving me some much needed advice, and the kick in the ass I needed.  Shel spent more time with me than most of the nurses did.  I also want to give a special thanks to my new friend  Nipsy II  my new canine friend watched over me while in the hospital and I will treasure him forever.  Thanks to everyone who sent their thoughts and prayers along the way, I appreciate them all.  I will be on a not normal schedule for awhile as I adjust to the new move, I am now living with mom for a the time being and loving it.  I have a really  good question to post, but I want to save the comedy for another day, and let this post be a little more serious.  I also wish to post two poems.  The first one I wrote a week before I had my melt down, the second I wrote while on a gurney in the hallway in the hospital,they are both pretty raw, so enjoy them.    Change...   Like ancient alchelmy These magical hormones  Have transformed me. Not into gold, Yet no longer lead. But an alloy instead No better  Or worse Than either. Mixed together In just the right fashion To provide Someday Optimum Satisfaction.  As I gaze upon my reflection. Before me lies In all my nakedness Both as nature intended, And what I have changed. I am overwhelmed  By joy. By grief. Married together Almost as a single emotion.  I am comfortable with the changes, And wish they could happen faster. I see the equipment, From the masked life I once lived. Pretending to fit in, And longing not to be there.  I imagine the scars That will one day greet me. And remind me What I once HAD to be. What I went through to get them. And how I lost everything, Just  To Be  Me.  I hate this time Inbetween. Its uncertainness, And of not belonging. I am a mid thirty something teenager.  Casting off old things, While looking  For something new. Too tied down to the past, To reach the new yet. Too close to the new, To ever go back.    Lost...    Lost in the dark Looking for truth. Looking for light, Trying to find my way back. Back from the brink. Back from the edge onto nothingness, Emptiness. TOTAL hopelessness.  Alone, In the dark. I truly lost ALL hope. Somehow a flicker Shown itself at the right moment. It guided me to safety. Safety from myself, From the hopelessness.  I still feel helpless. My courage and fire are still lost. They are MIA. I am waiting for them to arrive. They will get here soon I hope. I need them to get out, To get home, To be healed.

       Now without haloscan...      After thinking about things for a little bit, I have decided to take the comment feature away for now off this blog. I am doing it for 4 reasons. First it is always the same few folks who comment on stuff, the same folks who I talk to all the time online anyway. Secondly I think by going back to just getting hate email it gives folks a little bit more time to read things over and think about what they want to say about what I wrote. Third I just am not comfortable that anyone could basically have written stuff on my site, and it would of been a pain in the ass to delete it. Lastly I am doing it because it is my blog and I feel like it. That really is the only reason I need anyway, but trying not be a total asshole I thought I would explain.      Sorry for taking it away, if you guys really want it back you have my email both of this site and my main email so use it. I am sorry to silence your voices online, but I assure you that if you want me to share something I will.      Heading up with mom, co and the kids to the Boston area this weekend. Not totally a pleasurable trip, but a necessary one for mom.      Love to all, take care.

       Good vibrations...     Please Ms. Universe, share the good Karma you have graced me with to my family, friends and loved ones. I know allot of them can use it, especially since they have to hang around me.     Had what could have been a really crappy day at work today turn into a good one, by just doing. In our daily am meeting my boss was looking for a volunteer to go to a store not in any of our usual territories, and who ever did would get all the revenue instead of having to share it. I loved the idea, except for the fact it was a customer from the old life. I told my boss I had dealt extensively with several of the folks there and they new me in the male mode.(she still doesn't know my male name, nor has she asked.) She had to think about it for a bit and we had a little heart to heart. I assured her that I was ok with it, the guy I was meeting was not one I dealt with in the past. I told her it was ok, and I had to do it, to show myself I wasn't afraid to do it. I talked her into it, and assured her I would stay professional and not risk the integrity of the paper by causing a scene. So I went out, had the meeting, made a decent presentation to a man who knows it all. I really hate the type who have been in business so long they are experts and you are shit. So after dealing with Mr. Wonderful, I tempted fate and went over to see my friend over in the business office. She didn't recognize me at first and in fact gave me a nasty look. Once she figured out who I was, she was cool. She punched out and we went down to the local deli, she got lunch I grabbed a soda, and we caught up. She hasn't seen me as Ash only the old me. She talked to me for less than a minute on how good I look and transition stuff and then we got back to real life shit. It was so cool to be treated like a normal person by someone from my past. No awkward questions or pauses, no talking about tranny stuff for 30 mins, just two old friends talking about normal life. It was nice indeed. I get that kind of reception at work but they only know the present and not the past, so it is different. I know I won't ever get some of my friends to jump on board, but it is nice to have the ones who do.   After I got back from the meeting I went and gave a recap to my boss, and then we had another talk. I assured her I didn't want her to think I wasn't capable of doing my job or taking care of any customer due to my issues. She agreed and we now have an understanding, if there does arise a situation that is not good for me to go into, let her know. It is the same thing she does for the other reps. Sometimes personalities clash and the boss has to step in. Glad I don't have her job right now, but someday I would love to have it. I would also love to have the little gray sporty BMW I saw at a clients shop too, but I have better things to spend $ I don't have on.   Before work I had to go to electrol. Never again will I go that early. I didn't have time to hydrate properly, add that to all the salt I have been eating lately,and you got some intense pain cooking. I only booked 30 mins but I barely lasted 20. I have never to my knowledge had her stop, nor do I remember squirming so much on her table. I felt so bad, and I was in tears from the pain. I hope it is the hydration issue, and not something like the Celexa I take. It might be a side effect but I am not sure. What ever the reason, after today I am glad I don't go back for a few weeks. I am usually very good with pain, but not today.   After work it was more work. But this is the easy ass job. I get paid for much more than I have to work, I can finnish the job if I go full bore in less than 25 mins. I get paid for the whole thing so I earn $55 an hour. Nice # but shitty time working for that. I have learned how to work very hard, very fast, and do a good quality job. I want to make sure I get to keep this second job for now. It isn't rocket science, it is mindless work that keeps me in shape and gives me a bit more cash. I do need to get a budget worked out or my kids will be in college before I get surgery. I know what I have to have to get the surgery, now I just have to make the map to get there.   Today was also my first day published in a main stream newspaper. I unfortunately got no bylines since it is what is called  additorial (an editorital section for an ad). Basically they used my piece on how to choose landscaping and how to choose a roofing and siding contractor.&nbsp; They also used portions of my pieces on Auto repair, RV shopping and how to choose a day spa.&nbsp;My side appears across from the ads.&nbsp; I also happened to design some kick ass sweet ads, I love it when I can figure out what the customer wants by just taking few moments with them, and making the magic happen.&nbsp; The writting part isn't totally exciting stuff, but I consider it a small step to being someday a mainstream writer. I still want to do&nbsp;the book on my life, I&nbsp;have been through some really&nbsp;interesting stuff in my life.&nbsp; I have been blessed in&nbsp;having seen allot of shit, and being in lots of interesting situations.&nbsp; I would also like to write some murder mystery, and sci-fi&nbsp; books too. I love to write and I have lots of ideas for stories, I just need the time and the courage to sit down and set my mind to doing it. I am never going to be a prize winning author by any means. All I want to do is share some good stories and entertain a few folks with some decent tales of suspense, and action. Maybe someday. Of course my other dream is to someday be a columnist for a mainstream paper, but somehow I think I lack the interest level to pull that off. I would love to write like Collin McEnroe, but he's a flaming liberal, I'm merely a hot match when it comes to political stuff. I just love his brashness and sense of humor. It is allot like my own, but if someone is doing the job perfectly now, why try and improve on it? He does a much better job than I would do. Hey I hope to be on this earth a long time still, maybe over time I will get there.      Goodnite friends, may God not only give you great dreams, but may you also get the courage to go after those you really want.      Take care, and love to all.

       Caution,mean side alert...  I commented the other day how I am in a good place, and I am for the most part.  It feels nice to be on solid ground again, not running on ice.  Not all is perfect in my world.  I have some friends who are having a rough time,I just lost a pet, for me life is sometimes lonely, and of course working for someone else tends to have issues from time to time.  It is nice to get back to normal life, but after all the shit I have been through I have had enough.  I just want to grab life by the collar and bitch slap it for throwing so much into my little part of the world.  Go bother someone else.  I am not blue about it, instead I am operating in Bitch mode, or Fucking Asshole mode.  I keep pissing people off lately, family, friends, friends of friends, ex co workers, present co workers, people on the street.  I just seem to be doing everything right to make everyone else's life miserable.  It is harsh to say, but sometimes you just have to.  I truly am a fucking asshole, in fact I am thinking about forming my own support group, I will be the founding member.  I don't know why it is happening now, things in life happen in phases.  We are never only one thing all the time.  For one reason or another I have gotten totally sick of society in general.  Has nothing to do with trans shit, most of society has no idea I'm trans.  I am thinking about becoming a nun after surgery.  At least that way I can hang out with a bunch of gals who drink all night, and aren't afraid to use a battery operated device.  Wow see now I'm picking on nuns, I am an asshole.  But I am dead serious about the drinking.  My grandmother lived behind a catholic school and some of the nuns lived on site, and I got to see the bottles they threw out.    Anyway, not sure what is going on. It could be a whole list of things.  I heard another horror story about things falling off after surgery the other day.  Pets are dieing, people are in danger of dieing, credit being sent to hell, and lots of folks mad at me about what I write.  And yet this are goodtimes in all seriousness, I am oddly in a good place.  If you happen to talk to me, or write to me, and I snap back at you, it most likely isn't you.  In the mood I am in, if it was you, I am sure I would tell you.  I assure you down deep I have a good heart, but sometimes I do need to let the inner asshole take over.  Hope it doesn't last too long, and I hope I don't scare too many folks away before it does.  Love to all, take care, and be careful not to piss me off.   I love the smell of burning hair folicles in the morning..  Ok, ok yes I know the line is napam, and the little bits I remember of being able to sneak a peak at when my folks weren't noticing I don't remember anyone getting electrol.  I know I can watch it now, but I hate war movies now, It is one of the few things that have changed about me in the last decade for the better I might add.  I do have an early morning zapping treatment today, and I just had to use the line.  Too bad I couldn't download flight of the valkaries(sorry for spelling) into the blog for added effect.

       Nice problem to have...  After reaching almost 6 months of bitching and whining daily if not several times a day I am finding that things are finally settling down enough not to have to right every day.  Is is the calm before another storm?  Are things finally right in Ashleyville?  Work is going good, the girls treat me just like they treat each other, nice to my face, bitch behind my back. The key thing is they accept me,  I got a playful response from a gal when she told me she lost 6lbs the last 2 weeks, I told her back that I found 4 of them on my stomach and ass.  It is nice to be able to just be a person, not a freak, not have to talk about a past less ordinary. My relationship with Co is going nice.  Once I was able to handle being only friends it made life so much easier.  We won't ever go back to being lovers, but we both want to be the best friends to each other that we can be.  We still have some bugs to workout, but we aren't dancing on a razor edge anymore, we are on solid ground.  It is nice to have someone so understanding in my life, and I thank God for her everyday.  It's nice to not have to write shit if I don't want too.  I do love to write, and the more the better, but it does tend to get old having to write about how bad shit is all the time, followed by really good times.  I could use some flat line shit for awhile.  To just be able to set the cruise control and let life drive for awhile. Life tends to ebb and flow, glad to see the tide is in and I can do some sailing close to shore for just a bit.   Love to all, and take care.

       Reality sets in, and the "gift"...  I didn't get a chance to share a few things yesterday due to the death in the family.  I do want to share both so here they are, silly and strange but serious.   Reality setting in..  I was never a big dude, but I was strong for my size indeed.  For years I hefted big bags of grain on my broad shoulders.  For years I played hockey and gave punishment as good if not better than I took it.  I moved big shit that smarter men wouldn't have attempted to pick up.  I used to stay at a few hotels for my last big job that had really nice stationary equipment.  I would go down and dick around on the machines to kill time.  Life was lonely on the road, I needed something to help pass the lonely nights, other than the usual cd'ing.  So I would always see how strong I was, and each time there try to beat the last time, so freaking male I know. I actually used to max out one machine.  It was the leg press and maxed out at 210.  Other machines were various weights, but the legs were my strongest muscle group.  So fast forward to present.  Mom and I were cleaning the workout room at the place we clean together on weekends.  I had to try the equipment.  It was nice to see the reality of things.  I am nowhere near where I once was.  Here I have been fretting about still having muscles making me look to masculine, and I go and find out, it's all in my head.  I couldn't do half of anything I used to do except for the sit down row.  I still have my back muscles, probably from hauling around the kids every weekend, and cleaning shit 5 days a week.  It really is nice to notice a big difference between the old and new, it means I am getting somewhere.  I have been so non receptive to compliments about my looks and I still see allot of the old me in the mirror.  Maybe this will help me see what is really there.  A mix of old and new.  Improved over what I used to be, but still retaining some of the attributes non the less.   The "Gift"..  Now for all you who don't already think I am crazy here is a reason too.  I have talked in the past about being able to sense presences and such of spirits and other things.  I didn't mention the "gift" or I as I call it the curse of premonition and vision.  This gift has ebbed and flowed in various times in my life, just like with my ability to write poetry in mass quanities.   I remember several specific times in my life when this has happened before; shortly after my parents divorce, when we moved in my teens, after my failed transitions in the early 90's and I guess now is another.  I hate being able to see shit that comes true, it is not a fun thing and messes with your head.  They are not dreams this time as they were before, this time they are coming in awake time, really freaky ass shit.  I don't know if it from the meds or what, they always used to come in my sleep and they were easier to deal with.  Now they come in the day time and I am not only subjected to disturbing images but disturbed by how they come in the middle of shit.  It makes not losing one's mind just a bit harder, don't you think?    The first one came about 3 or 4 weeks ago, and I did share it with a friend since it was so damn vivid.  I envisioned Dale Jr. of Nascar fame, getting in a firery crash, but not in his normal car.  It looked like a race, but it wasn't his normal red #8 car.  The flames from the crash were so intense I assumed from it he had perished.  I told Shel about it, just to keep myself sane.  She picked on me for being all doom and gloom and told me I was being silly.  Well you could imagine my fear when watching the news last Sunday they showed Jr. getting in a firey crash in some sort of race he normally doesn't do.  It was sobering indeed, Shel was a little bit freaked out by the whole thing too.  Ok now the important shit.  I recently had another vision about the death of a friend from a work related accident.  It was scary, I didn't see what happened but I was giving a eulogy for her.  I remember saying how "she wasn't just my friend, but a friend to so many different people.  She reached out to many communities to try and make things better.  She was indeed a friend to all."  It was creepy when it happened.  I was at my night job cleaning and all of a sudden I had to stop cleaning while this mini movie played in my head.  I know who it was, but I am afraid to tell this person.  This is where the gift becomes a curse.  Was it real?  If so is it imperative to tell this person?  If I tell them, will the be overly cautious and then end up getting hurt?  If I don't tell them, and it happens, could I have prevented it?  Does it come true because I tell her, and in essence I will be responsible for her death? Was I working too hard, and it was an over active imagination?  I have so many questions on the whole matter.  I will have to sit back some more and think about it allot.  I wasn't going to say anything about it, and only a week after the first one coming true can I even write about it.  Trust me I am not crazy, I have had this stuff happen before and in about 6 months I will be back to just having little Deja Vu dreams again.  It sounds silly to me writing it, so it must sound even sillier to you reading it.  But I assure you it is real.  I do have a question for all who take me seriously enough to answer.  Should I tell the friend?  It is one of you guys who reads this, so answer carefully if you would want to be told or not.  It may never come true and just be a silly thing I ate, it may come true before I get to say anything, I don't know.  So if you read this, and feel like humoring a crazy gal,tell me your opinion on the matter.  Should I tell a friend of possible impending death when I know I sometimes see shit before it happens?    Love to all, take care, and be careful out there.

       Mixed weekend...   It was the best of weekends, It was the worst of weekends.&nbsp; We had a decent time at the 20 picnic, good eats, good weather, good company, and good behavior for the most part by the kids.&nbsp; We did not go hungry for sure, I don't think anyone did.&nbsp; I had to do my usual good Samaritan bs and wouldn't let the recent post ops carry anything bulky or heavy.&nbsp; I am sure it gets annoying after awhile how I baby some folks.&nbsp;  Saturday was also my 6 months of being Ash full time.&nbsp; It has been a long 6 months, sometimes it feels like 6 years sometimes.&nbsp; It amazes me how it all seems so natural to me,&nbsp; and how it nice it is to be me.&nbsp; I also got a return note from an old work chum.&nbsp; We both are hurt by some of the stuff that has happened,&nbsp; and I loved that he took the time to write me.&nbsp; I wish him well, and hopes he checks out the site himself and stops listening to the grapevine.  I also burnt some old stuff I would rather not remember.&nbsp; I took a few old hockey jerseys from the teams where the guys have been the most brutal to me.&nbsp; I also took some of the shirts from the companies who had been the nastiest to me, along with some stuff I don't want to remember.&nbsp; It was nice to watch them go up in flames, I felt the bad vibes and feelings leave with every item perishing into the flames.&nbsp; It was sad in a way too, I had allot of good memories in those items, that is the only reason I kept them when I got rid of my male clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hard sometimes in this life.&nbsp; I had so many good times while being miserable.&nbsp; If I hadn't had this problem I would have been in pure heaven.&nbsp; I look forward to maybe getting many more good memories in my good life.&nbsp; I don't think it will be that hard, I am simple to please, I love the simple things in life.  Today was a hard day.&nbsp; I kept my little girl with me longer and she helped mom and I clean, and then I took her home.&nbsp; Well when Co went home earlier in the day she found our cat in full seizure.&nbsp; She called the vet and within the next 30 mins our cat had another 3 massive seizures.&nbsp; The vet ran some quick tests, but in her examination she noticed that the kidneys had shut down, and there was some other damages.&nbsp; We don't know what happened to her, but Co did the only reasonable thing and stopped the suffering.&nbsp; She is getting her cremated so we can have the ashes.&nbsp; Co and I lived together for about 5 years before we had kids, so our pets were our first kids.&nbsp; We took a cat I had when me moved in together but soon after acquired a puppy named Rocky and the kitten of course was Bullwinkle.&nbsp; We lost Rocky last year to old age before we moved, Bullwinkle's day was today.&nbsp; I wish I had a chance to say goodbye, I still remember bringing her home in my pocket.&nbsp; Her mom had been squashed by a dumpster and she was only 3 weeks old when I brought her home.&nbsp; We had to feed her with a bottle for the first few weeks, she was like my little baby.&nbsp; I am trying to hook up my scanner so I can share pics with you guys of her and Rocky too.&nbsp; I know it might seem silly to some of you to cry over a cat, but I love my animals. I miss her greatly and I hope she didn't suffer too much.&nbsp; Bon soir mon chat, j'aime tu.   Love to all, and take care.

       Ice queen, big 6's, R.W.T., and the swift hand of Karma...   Wow now there's a title for you. Today had some much shit in it, so I had to make it a long title. I will do it piece by piece so enjoy...    R.W.T...   Ok flipping through the channels I came across an appalling spectacle on one of those access Hollywood type shows. They were covering a tranny beauty pageant. This shit makes me sick. How the hell do we ever expect to be treated with respect and not as punchlines if this is how we let folks see us as a group on TV? All you seem to see is a bunch of middle age white folk who have spent tons of money to look like Pam Anderson or some other type of plastic freak. Where are the people of color? Where are those of us that choose to not have plastic surgery? Where are all the stories on the ones that live normal quiet lives, or lost jobs, or are so bad they have sex for money just to survive? I really don't get why all they do is show the  Rich White Trannies , making asses of themselves and making a mockery of what the hell it means to be a woman. I hate that these assholes are the self nominated spokes persons for trannies. You idiots may be trannies, but don't ever think you speak for me or my tribe. There seem to be two types of trannies, the idiots who think being a woman is all fun and games aka the  cartoon type , and then the type that want to be real. The  real ones  tend to have a bit more respect for gen women, we tend to tred lightly into spaces and try to treat people with the same respect we want. The  cartoon type  tend to think they still have all the privledges of men and think they can bust into anywhere. They love to freak folks out all the time and make a mockery out of not only being a tranny but a woman as well. You won't ever be treated like a woman if you fuckheads don't start acting like a woman, or even a real human being for that matter. Cartoon characters live in the Sunday comics, or on cartoon network not in real life, stop trying to be one.  R.W.T's  are always closer to the  cartoon type  more than the  real type.    The swift hand of Karma...  That little bitch who was fucking with me yesterday got hers today.  She lost two of the accounts she sold for the contest.  She even lost the one she beat me by 10 mins or so that earned her a paid day off.  When I asked my boss if I now got the paid day off, she replied that it wouldn't be fair to her to take it away.  I don't care if she wants to continue screwing me, I will just continue to sell for me.  I outsold people that have been at the paper a long time, and I get better every day.  It is not nice to enjoy other people's sorrow, but I have to admit I loved seeing her so upset.  I guess she got hers quicker than most, even though I highly doubt it was what she did to me, but it was nice to see anyway.   The Ice queen..  This morning with people loosing ads the last minute and all the crap of trying to get all the ads finished and proofed for 2 really big projects on top of handling all the normal advertising stuff, the office atmosphere was horrid.  Stress and anger, along with panic filled the air and it was really making work an unhealthy place today.  I got out as soon as I could and hit the road.  While I was thinking about all the crap and thinking about going to talk to my shrink about the negative energy at work and how to deal with it I had a brain storm.  I stopped at the grocery store and got 2 big boxes of popsicles.  I proceeded to go back to the office with popsicles in hand and went through the entire building handing out popsicles.  When folks asked why I said "  Two reasons: first it's hot in here in more ways than one, and we all need to chill.  Secondly we can't yell at each other when we all have popsicles in our mouths.    It was so nice to get everyone in the building in better spirits.  No matter where you seem to go, someone is always bitching about how bad it is there.  I don't get it, we have jobs, we get paid, and it really isn't hard work if you handle it well. In figuring things out, I actually saved myself $12.  If I went to see the shrink the co pay is $15. The popsicles I got on sale cost me $3.    Co pay for a shrink $15. 2 boxes of popsicle $3. Saving $12 and making people smile... PRICELESS...    So now I am the ice queen at work, but in a different meaning.  I am know for being a bit unorthodox in how I do things, and this was odd for me.  I don't know exactly why I did it, but it was fun being nice and trying to pay back some good Karma back for all my blessings.   Big 6's...  Ok it's time for big 6 month anniversaries.  Tomorrow is the day I was asked to leave my job.  Saturday is the start of my life as Ashley full time.  I have to say it has been an eventful 6 months.  I have had a few times where I never thought I would make it another day, but I keep going.  I haven't figured out why I do, I must be a gluten for punishment.  I may not be the brightest bulb in the box, but I assure you, I am the most determined and preserverant.  Love to all, and take care.

       Comfort zone...   In an ok place right now.  I am not on the top of the world, but close to it for now.  If it weren't for a few things I think I would be on top.   First the bad, I found out yesterday a friend from my old life, from way back to high school is in the hospital.  He had a little trouble with his meds, and had a little overdose.  He is being transferred to a facility down south a little closer to his family who all migrated back down there years ago.  The other thing is one of my close alies at work has gone a bit off the deep end and taken my competition for this sales contest as personal.  She is constantly talking down to me when I make an error in paperwork or don't know an answer with "  Oh that's ok your new, we'll forgive you being stupid, you don't know any better."    So I hit back the whole contest as I have been outselling her..."  Umm don't you feel bad, the new girl is beating you...but that's ok, I'll forgive you, because I'm new."   I guess it got to her more than I thought.  She is a mamma's girl goody 2 shoes, or at least that's the airs she puts on.  From what I know of her, she is 6 months my jr, still lives with mom and dad, never left home, and while in hs and college was a little drunk ass, drug addicted whore, and those were her good points.  Today she made some digs that she had no idea how much they hurt about mental health issues.  She also called me loser as I was coming in behind her, even though she claims she said booger,yeah right.  I have been known to be a sore looser, but the only thing worse than a sore loser is a sore winner.  She sold less than I, yet she sold at the right time and ended up with 2 rooms at the casino, $50, and a paid day off.  I sold 2 more than her and got $40.  I don't get the whole incentive program at my company, but I do have to say it is a little bit fucked when the top producer gets shafted.  I have to ask myself why push so hard next time?  But then I have the same answer, because I have to.  I can't ever accept failure, I don't allow myself to fail if at all possible, and it was this ethic that has brought me far in the past and will serve me well for a long time.  The baseball game was excellent, I loved being hostess.  The game was great the guests were great.  It was even more polarised than the last time.  All but one of the women were gathered inside while the boys watched the game. I don't even really miss the whole group of men watching sports thing. It is nice to be included in the little tribe of women.  I can not explain how much it means to me to be accepted in.  I am one of the lucky ones who blends nicely into the whole realm of womanhood.  Many are not so lucky. Of course after the guests all left before the game ended because we were up and it was late.  I sat with my feet up and watched the game comfortably from a great seat.  I got a few looks but who cares? I did have to deal with my least favorite group last night too.  Teen age girls.  I have no idea why they give me such fits and nerves, but they do.  One is ok, 2 or more freak me the hell out.  Teenage girls are brutally catty picking on  anyone and how they look.  While I pass fine with the adult crowd, my hair and makeup are not the in teen thing, and my clothes are purposefully loose which is another teen faux pas.  So they whisper, and the whole time you wonder, are they talking about me, is it my style, or do they make me?  I know as Co has told me time and time again, the whole world is not concerned about me, but it is hard not to think that around teenage girls.  I hope to get over this before my daughter becomes one.  Only a little bit more than 7 more years to go.  So over all things are ok.  Jobs are good, even though I didn't win the prizes I still sold the most ads,and earned the most revenue.  I sold just under half of our total ads, this with a total crew of 8 working on it.  Friends are ok, but I still worry, fam is ok.  I do have a new worry that I didn't know could happen thanks to JR. JC and the boys, never mind nightmares, you are giving me daymares too.  I won't go into it much but it involves a complication from someone she knows who didn't take care of their new equipment properly.  I guess allot can happen if you don't take care of it, or yourself.  In the revenge file, I just found out today that someone from my old job, but I have known much longer is in dire financial straights with their business.  I won't say who because it is not nice to spread the word on sorrow.  They were one of the nasty ones to me over this.  They were turning the old rumor mill on me, even though I asked them not to out of respect for Co and the kids, who they knew.  It didn't matter and the rumors flew faster than anywhere else.  I am sorry for the folks that work there that they may lose their jobs, but I shed no tears for the owners.  It may take awhile but bad things do get paid back.  This one took a longer time, and like I said they were from way back in my life, so Karma is a bit backed up right now.  I hope the good stuff works faster than the bad for all of you, even the ones who will get the bad someday.  Love to all and take care.

       Shock treatment and baseball...     &nbsp;  First I got to finally go back to my electrologist for the first time since God knows when.&nbsp; I have to admit, it hurt like hell.&nbsp; I need to get my tolerance back up.&nbsp; There were sessions where I would go through 2 hours of zapping without much pain at all.&nbsp; It will take awhile but I will get my tolerance back up, no more 2 hour sessions, but I don't like it when it hurts so bad either.  &nbsp;  Tonight is my night to play hostess for our skybox for our local baseball team.&nbsp; My company owns a skybox there and we use it to take out important clients.&nbsp; I get to take out a few of our biggest non national accounts tonight.&nbsp; I have only been with the company a bit over a month and already I am being trusted with taking out the big clients.&nbsp; Wow I guess I am good.  &nbsp;  It was nice to get some really good news in my circle of friends for a change.&nbsp; From my old life, some friends who used to be really close, but aren't any longer, just had their first child(Madison Rose).&nbsp; Even though I don't talk to them anymore I do talk to his bro every now and then.&nbsp; I know how many tens of thousands of dollars they have spent in trying to have a child.&nbsp; I am glad to see they finally succeeded.&nbsp; I would have adopted myself at that point, but he makes excellent $ so he can spend it how he wishes.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  From my new life... I have a friend who just got her appointment for surgery.&nbsp; I am very happy for her, I wish her well.&nbsp; I know she has thought about this long and hard, and she seems sincere that this is the right option for her.&nbsp; I have another friend who just mustered up the courage to call and make her first appointment with GICNE.&nbsp; It has been a long journey for her too.&nbsp; I have been telling her when she is ready she will call.&nbsp; I guess she was ready.&nbsp; I try very hard not to cheerlead, and encourage folks to hop on the tranny bus.&nbsp; I talk with them and ask the hard questions and try to help them make sure this is for them.&nbsp; This is a hard life, and I don't hide it.&nbsp; I cry often that my life is like this.&nbsp; I wish every day that it could have been different for me.&nbsp; Nobody SANE wants to be a tranny, it just happens.&nbsp; I wish I didn't have to be one myself, but since I do, I will work hard to make the best of it.&nbsp; I try and help out folks I see along the way.&nbsp; It is very hard to do, folks have to be able to help themselves to be able to make it.&nbsp; Glad to see some make it on their own terms. &nbsp; Ok off to take over the advertising world and build my empire.&nbsp; Not to mention catch some good baseball while smoozing clients.  &nbsp;  Love to all, and take care

       The  bad ole  days...   &nbsp;  Mom was getting ready to leave this am as I was preparing my lunch, potted meat and ketchup sandwiches(aka cat food and ketchup).&nbsp; She asked if I need $ or wanted for her to pick up some cold cuts.&nbsp; I explained to her its ok, potted meat may not look great, but it is an ok lunch.&nbsp; I grew fond of them again back when I was on unemployment.&nbsp; We grew up with potted meat.&nbsp; We were poor, but we NEVER went hungry as kids.&nbsp; Mom and dad always made sure we had something, even if it was potted meat and mac n cheese.&nbsp; Mom apologized when I told her I like it, and yes it does save me money.&nbsp; She went on how she had to buy it for us when the $ was really tight when I was a kid, and she told me a bit more about her childhood.  &nbsp;  My grandfather was a hard working carpenter, but when the mill shut down, no one had the money to hire him.&nbsp; He was also too proud to accept handouts or government assistance.&nbsp; My mom and her siblings were malnourished as a result.&nbsp; Mom was telling me how sometime my grandfather would do work for barter and get a few bantam chickens in return for services rendered.&nbsp; Yet even though the family was starving he didn't have the heart to kill them himself.&nbsp; So my grandmother had to do it.&nbsp; As mom is telling me the story I am envisioning in my head a younger version of my grandmother chasing little bantam chickens around the neighborhood with a small hachet in hand.&nbsp; What a sight that must have been to see, I bet the neighbors thought she flipped her lid.  &nbsp;  Well mom survived the bad ole days, and made sure as kids we never went hungry.&nbsp; I have had times when I was homeless that I did go hungry for a day or two, but never too long at all.&nbsp; I have been blessed I guess with good luck and a hard work ethic that always seems to help me get out of situations.&nbsp; Glad my folks taught me well by example.&nbsp; I hope my kids will learn from Co and my struggles in life and learn from them too.&nbsp; One must work hard in order to make it work.&nbsp; A famous man once said " It's funny, it seems the harder I work, the luckier I am."&nbsp;  Who said it? The name escapes me, but I am pretty sure it was either a founding father, Abe Lincoln or Henry Ford, but I cannot remember whom.  &nbsp;  Oh well off to take over the world of advertising once again, followed to a visit to the goddess of pain and hair removal.&nbsp; I was able only to get a half hour appointment tonight, I will get longer ones in the future.&nbsp; Thank God I am going though my brows are getting to look like a muppet.  &nbsp;  Love to all, and take care.

       Just a normal weekend...     &nbsp;  It was nice to have a normal weekend for a change.&nbsp; Actually got to sleep in late on Sat. am, it was nice to get a morning in for a change.&nbsp; Co and the kids came over, we went down to the park for an"inner city picnic".&nbsp; Basically we went to the drive-thru at Wendys, brought it to the park and ate it on a blanket.&nbsp; We let the kids play on the play scape for about an hour and the kids loved it.&nbsp; I made an awesome dinner.&nbsp; A friend was supposed to come over for dinner, but cancelled last minute.&nbsp; It still was a great meal; bbq chicken, wrapped around bacon and provolone cheese.&nbsp; I also made homemade french fries and onion straws.&nbsp; Add some farm fresh corn on the cob, and it was a great summer meal.  &nbsp;  After dinner I experimented with a new drink, and came up with a great one.&nbsp; Apple pie a la mode.&nbsp; You take 1oz of pucker sour apple schnapps, a small scoop of vanilla ice cream, and a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon.&nbsp; It truly tastes like real apple pie a la mode.&nbsp; Co and I shared one, neither one of us are big drinkers, but we do indulge every now and then.  &nbsp;  Today was ok, Trev came over and picked up the cat.&nbsp; He recently&nbsp;had to put his cat down&nbsp;and mom really thought 3 was getting to be too much for our apartment.&nbsp; It works out great since Trev fell in love with the kitten at the picnic.&nbsp; It was truly meant to be.&nbsp; We are also going to Podunk together and splitting a campsite.&nbsp; I will be taking my daughter to camp out Friday and Saturday, she will have a great time for sure.&nbsp; I used to do lots of stuff with my daughter to try and keep our relationship special.&nbsp; I feel so bad for taking her daddy away so I try extra hard to keep it special with her.&nbsp; A little girls relationship with her dad is a very special one indeed, so I need to make sure I try and keep working hard on it.&nbsp; She is very well adjusted so far in this, I know she will get through it all ok, we both need to work hard to make sure she does.  &nbsp;  My friend Di and I are starting to work on a little project together that should be fun.&nbsp; I will have more information to share as we go along, but&nbsp; it will be good I assure you.  &nbsp;  Ok sorry for the boring commentary tonight, sometimes it is nice to get a little bit of a break, but it makes for boring writing sometimes too.  &nbsp;  Love to all, take care and g'nite.

       Sometimes your the foot and sometimes your the ball...     &nbsp;  Ok today was one of those days where I was the ball.&nbsp; I forgot to take my damn meds so I was worried all day.&nbsp; Never got blue too much, but man did I get angry today.&nbsp; I've been working my ass off on this really big project I have been telling you about, and I have sold by myself almost half the ads we have,  showing off again. &nbsp; Meanwhile one of the merchants I sold an add to was leaving on vacation today, and needed the ad this am.&nbsp; The girls upstairs who promised me it by this am, poo poo'd it like it was no big deal.&nbsp; I am very afraid the deal is dead.&nbsp; I took my anger today on my steering wheel, if you lose the ad due to their attitude I am going to go apeshit.&nbsp; No violence mind you, but when I am done with talking to my boss and the design girl someone will be leaving, and I like it there allot.  &nbsp;  Still dealing with the whole sick friend issue.&nbsp; I wish her well, and wish I could do more, but I am not the person she needs to turn to for help in this.&nbsp; This is out of my league for sure.  &nbsp;  Went and cleaned tonight.&nbsp; This time the ladies were the pigs in the restrooms.&nbsp;  Ok gals you know those little boxes next to the toilet with the bags in them.&nbsp; It makes life so much easier if we place things in the bag before stuffing them in the box.&nbsp; Here's a better idea.&nbsp; Put your discarded personals, in the bag and throw them in the big trash so other folks don't have to see your garbage.&nbsp; I do know where to get some white hot pepper,and I will put some on your tp if you continue to piss me off.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  After work mom and I took all our cans and bottles to cash them in.&nbsp; And then went to the package store.&nbsp; I've never been in a packie with mom before never mind bought booze with her.&nbsp; She had to have her Yukon Jack, I love the shit too.&nbsp; I also got a small bottle of apple pucker schnapps, yummy.&nbsp; I also got a nipper of tequila.&nbsp; Before it hit the back of my throat it was in the sink.&nbsp; It was the nastiest shit I have ever tasted.&nbsp; No more tequila for this gal.&nbsp; I'm happy with my sour apple schnapps on the rocks and sitting outside talking with mom.&nbsp; It is funny how we have a really great relationship.&nbsp; My little sister never got along with mom, so mom missed out on having a real mother daughter thing.&nbsp; Now she is&nbsp;trying to make up for it by doing lots of shit with me.&nbsp; Hey I love it, we are all on this earth for such a short time, our folks are here less than we are, we need to enjoy them while we can.&nbsp; I love both my parents and I am lucky to have them.&nbsp; I don't know what I did to keep having great folks around me, if I did I'd bottle it, or write a how to on it.  &nbsp;  Speaking of how to, our big project with the same name is coming to a head.&nbsp; We end it on Tuesday.&nbsp; I am actually writing editorial content for the special tab.&nbsp; That is great news that I get to write for the paper, I would love to be a columnist for a mainstream paper one day.&nbsp; The bad news is I get no byline or written credit for my work.&nbsp; I was given a nice compliment in a way and a nice boost when the boss told me that my editorial would be used by the other papers in our company too.&nbsp; So if you buy a paper owned by the Journal Register company, and read a how to article on; finding a moving and storage company, finding a day spa, designing landscaping, or how to choose a roofing and siding contractor, it is my work.&nbsp; Enjoy they are just so exciting indeed.&nbsp; I feel like Bob Newhart's character on the one with Larry, Darrell, and Darrell.&nbsp; All I need is a b &amp; b in Vermont, and some how to books under my belt.  &nbsp;  Need some sleep, pucker is getting to my head.  &nbsp;  Love to all, and take care.

       Please say a little prayer for Shel...  I cannot say why, I made a promise.  But all who stop and read and have an ounce of human compassion in their souls, please say a quick little prayer to who ever you pray to for my friend Shel.  I won't get into it too much, that's her job, but if you could say a prayer for her well-being I would appreciate it greatly.  Thanks and love to all.

       Too much courage...  Ok I may be over doing it a bit with the Sobe Courage drinks.  Let me back things up a bit first.  Work was normal, but I had a hard thing hanging over my head today.  I have a close friend whom will remain nameless, who had to go for a test today.  She was all worried beforehand and I kept telling her over and over again, it was nothing and she was being silly.  Well unfortunately I was wrong and it is something serious.  She should recover just fine from it, but it will take some work.  I will not talk anymore about it until she is ready to talk about it.  Please don't pry, I won't tell a soul just as promised.  So after work to get my mind off things I went out to raw with a new straight friend Steph.  She is a friend of K's and K usually hangs with good folks, well ok she makes an exception for my sorry ass.  So I took Steph to Real Artways for the creative cocktail party.  It was interesting to say the least.  The art was a little too odd for me, it didn't speak it kind of mumbled.  There were some beautifuly painted exhibits of Puerto Rico's disdane with it's imperail masters, and our idiological commercialism.  We met up with AU and I introduced Steph to her(here come the friend stealing remarks from someone).  AU showed us this odd machine that was in the exhibit and how it worked.  It was nice of her to show us around like that. Of course we also ran into Di and talked a long while with her.  It was so loud and crowded inside, we spent most of our time outside in the night air and smoke.  I also ran into the friend who I had the little run it at twenty with, and things are cool to a point.  I guess more than one person sent her a nasty email from what I heard.  We talked for a bit, and tried to bridge the gap.  I know she is sorry for what she did.  I'm sorry she felt hurt by what was sent to her, but I cannot apologize for other folks reaction to a situation.  It is going to take awhile but it was a really nice first step into normalcy.  Ok back to the title now.  While we were outside I saw this guy I knew that I knew from high school.  I didn't have the courage to say hi in front of all those strangers, and as we were going to leave and I was looking to say goodbye to AU I ran into him again in a small room.  We were watching this film short on this guy who attached a trumpet to the exhaust pipe on a moped and is riding around the island of viagas(could be wrong on name) that was previously used by the US military for bombing exercises. It was interesting in its creativity and symbolism of reclaiming the land with his little trumpett blaring.  So anyway I asked him if he went to school in Southington, he said no.  I still knew I knew him.  So I asked what's your last name. He gave the name I thought and I said Peter right?  He looked puzzled.  He said yeah I went to school in Burlington though. I said class of 88, right?  He looked more puzzled and asked "how do you know me."  I told him we went to school together, but he wouldn't recognize me and before I even knew what I was doing I told him how I had been Scott.  It wasn't nearly as bad as I thought.  It has been 16 years since I graduated and I look nothing like I used to, so it was hard for him to recognize me.  I don't know why I did it, it just felt right to do at the time.  Peter was never a close friend, I don't even remember having many classes with him.  It is good practice for the day I finally decide to say hi to an old hockey buddy I run into on the street or in a store, or an old childhood friend who knew me better.  I just can't believe I had the balls to do it.  It seems small to some, but it was a pretty bold thing to do.    Spell check is down for some reason so please excuse my spelling tonight.  Love to all, take care.

       A good day(I think?)...  Today seemed like a good day overall.  I had my hearing today to try and get the unemployment from the time I was out between jobs due to my little breakdown.  My previous boss failed to show up, I think that was a good sign.  The referee was interesting.  I have trouble trusting a man who wears a wool suit in the summer.  Either they are very frugal to an extreme, or they are very old fashioned.  I had to tell my tale about the whole experience working for Allen and the whole change thing to this guy.  When I told him I "changed from Scott to Ashley" he said snottily "what like a sex change?"  I told him "not yet" and then explained the whole rlt thing.  I noticed his discomfort but didn't notice veins coming out or anything.  Latter I mentioned my kids and he replied "YOU have KIDS?" with more than a bit of disgust.  I really hate having to tell people like this about my life, but it is unfortunately a necessary evil at times.  I do expect to have to do a few more times, for my divorce and our bankruptcy hearing.  I don't look forward to them, but when you act like it is the norm folks usually behave themselves.  I won't know for at least a week if I won or loss.  If I lose it is no big deal, I will just appeal.  The state will be foolish to keep going, they are going to spend more money fighting paying me than I am trying to collect.  I'm not some flake trying to milk the system.  I truly was unemployed and I think I do deserve to collect for that short time.  As far as my cleaning job goes, it is still an easy job.  But sometimes bathrooms get nasty.  I really don't get how the men's room gets so messy?  I won't mention the place I clean but I do have two questions for  the guys that work there.  A. How does a man short shoot a urinal by 18 inches?  I know the equipment well, and realize you don't have pinpoint accuracy but come on.  The wall I can see, right under the toilet, but 18 inches away from the wall?  Nobody exists that is that big, and if they did they would be doing porn.  Unless someone cut your dick off and the sewed it back on backwards there is no excuse for missing that bad.  B.  How does pubic hair end up in the sink?  Did it get caught in your mustache while you head was up your boss's ass?  Or maybe your own ass?  Or is it that you are washing your junk in the sink?   The bathroom is usually not that bad, and I usually don't bitch like that, but the mess tonight was a little over the top.  At my day job I got called babe by a male customer, so much for that chivalry comment from yesterday huh?  I know it is just a part of the whole female experience, but that doesn't mean I have to like it.  At least he didn't call me b'eotch, or ho.  Love to all, and take care.

       Simple silliness...  Co sent me this, and it is funny we all need to remember to try and laugh a little bit more.  Thanks for today's extra chuckle Co.   12 truisms..   1. Now that food has replaced sex in my life, I can't even get into my own pants.   2. Marriage changes passion. Suddenly you're in bed with a relative.   3. I saw a woman wearing a sweat shirt with "Guess" on it. So I said "Implants?" She hit me.   4. How come we choose from just two people to run for president and 50 for Miss America?   5. A good friend will come and bail you out of jail...But, a true friend will be sitting next to you saying, "Damn...That was fun!"   6. I signed up for an exercise class and was told to wear loose fitting clothing. If I HAD any loose fitting clothing, I wouldn't have signed up in the first place!   7. When I was young we used to go "skinny dipping," now I just "chunky dunk."   8. Don't argue with an idiot; people watching may not be able to tell the difference.   9. Wouldn't it be nice if whenever we messed up our life we could simply press 'Ctrl Alt Delete' and start all over?   10. Why is it that our children can't read a Bible in school, but they can in prison?   11. Wouldn't you know it...Brain cells come and brain cells go, but FAT cells live forever.   12. Why do I have to swear on the Bible in court when the Ten Commandments cannot be displayed in a federal building?

        No rest for the wicked...  Busy damn week, last night and this morning spent working on two projects for the paper.  Finished working on distributor agreement for my friends in Florida last night.  Today I have my appeal hearing for unemployment, yuck.  Having to tell yet another state official how I used to be Scott, this is old sometimes.  Tonight is also my late night in the office followed by a few hours of cleaning.  Wow I am back at my old speed, always working at something.  I guess being a workaholic wasn't just a male thing.  On a bright note I found out last night chivalry isn't dead.  I was standing in the dairy isle trying to find the Italian blend cheese I needed for my pizza I was making last night, and I couldn't find it.  This nice older man who was also in the section started talking to me and asked what I was looking for.  He actually took time out and dug until he found the stuff I was looking for, my hero.  I am still getting used to being treated this way, and I know it is not the norm for most trannies.  I thank God that I get to feel this little fringe benefit.  I will never know what it feels like to be a gen woman and have the whole experience, at least not in this lifetime, but it is nice to experience some of it even if it is just a nice old man helping out a lady in distress over her cheese.  Life sure is odd sometimes.  Love to all and take care.

       God's sick sense of humor...  Ok yesterday it became very apparent to me that someone upstairs is messing with me and has the same sick sense of humor I have.  At work yesterday conversation turned to vacations and one of the girls is taking her family to the Cape.  I asked what part in my usual carefully asked questions leading them to the answers I want.  I have no idea where I learned this skill or acquired this gift.  Over time I have refined it and it has become so ingrained in me I don't even realize I am doing it sometimes.  Within a few questions I got to the part I was leading her to, P town.  She said they were going, so I questioned " you take your little girl to P town ?"  The pay-off question, I was a little bit more bothered by her answer.  "yeah we've gone before with her, I can remember when she saw her first man in a dress and I had to explain to her what   IT   was.  I told her now don't you ever bring one of those home to mommy now."  On her choice of words I was bothered, even though I didn't show.  From her tone, and body language she doesn't know and it wasn't a dig at me.  I have very mixed feelings on her little speech.  I don't want to piss off my cd friends but, I do not consider myself a man in a dress.  A man trying to become a woman in a dress maybe, but not just a man in a dress.  I don't feel her words were pointed at me, but the shock type drag queens that fill the scenery up in P town.  Later yesterday, after cleaning I had to run to the store to get a few things, and the divine intervention started on the piped in music in Stop n Shop.  First song I noticed was the Begee's "More than a woman".  Ok this song is hilarious to me, since I am more than a woman.  I know I shouldn't read into things but it keeps it fun.  I just gave the slight chuckle to myself, until the next song started, "not a girl" by Brittney Spears.  This one pisses me off, she whines in her song how she's "not a girl yet not quite a woman."  Ok if she isn't a woman yet, I'm in trouble and never will get there.  I had to chuckle to myself on the two songs back to back, and got out of there before Lola or dude looks like a lady came on.  I know it's just dumb luck those songs happened to be on while I was shopping, I just get very amused by the simple things in life sometimes.  On a sadder note, no one is now returning my calls from my last career, even my good friend Johny G.  I'm sorry that I pissed him off, not even sure what the hell I did to him.  If you are reading this G, hope you come back.  My other friend is gone too I fear from up there.  This has become so hard not only for me but for them.  They know me as one thing, I tell them I'm something else, and they get caught in the middle. Whether they approve of me or not, they get to hear all the shit from both sides on what Scott did.  I feel bad I involved them in the middle, it has worn on them, and because I am still so vocal on it, and out of the picture in the work place I have become a casualty of it.  It is so much easier to stop talking to the one who is being talked about, then it is the people you have to work with all the time.  I have brought it upon myself and I miss them all, yet I don't blame them I guess.  We all have to work, put food on the table etc, and I have made things very uncomfy up there by attacking those I feel wronged by, even if I have taken it easy, I keep doing it.  So to all the bipods up there in Hyde park, sorry.  I know I said the other day it would be my last apology, but I lied, I need to say sorry for the whole thing.  This has been a really interesting time for everyone involved, I wish I didn't have to involve them, but I did.  Ok enough of that, gotta go look over a distributor agreement and then go take on the day.  Love to all, and take care.

       Funk n festivities...  Won't go into too much here, but in a bit of a funk today.  Between the fallout on Friday, the fact my last friend from my old job stopped returning calls, and some other stuff, I was pretty down today.  Went to a nice little quiet party at a nice couple's  place.  It was nice to meet some new folks and just chill for a bit.  Of course the food and company were excellent, and there was lots of nice conversation, and no fights, always a plus.  The party helped my mood a bit, but I am still down just a bit.  One of my friends asked why I looked down, I told her she and I where both better off not talking about it, and we should just enjoy the party, and holy shit it worked.  As for the beach yesterday, I couldn't haven't imagined it any smoother.  I can't believe I had the balls to go to the beach when I still have balls.  I camouflaged everything pretty damn good, and nobody gave a second look.  I don't know what I am doing right, but it is working.  We went out after for some seafood to make the experience complete.  Yesterday was also the 4 month anniversary of Paul's passing.  It has been tough on mom, and it doesn't help when his kids are trying to get her pissed.  I am so glad I am here with her to help her realize they are bluffing, and backing her up.  His kids are so damn greedy, mom is leaving them part of the house after she passes, they want it all.  She isn't looking to make a quick buck like they do, she just wants a place to live.  Mom and Paul bought this place and paid the bills together for 5 years, the kids never lived here, yet they feel entitled to the house so they can profit from it, go figure.  They will get theirs someday, Paul I'm sorry your kids are disappointing you hun, I know you tried to raise them better.  I didn't share something very funny that happened on Friday with you since I was a little bit pissed about other shit.  I got another client for the big project and I am still responsible for half the clients we have on it.  The most senior member of the group, a male who I am sure is gay, not that there's anything wrong with that, asked "what did you do Ash, let him take you to the back cooler and have his way with you."   Now I may have changed allot in my transition in some regards but I am still a major smart ass, and too immature to not strike back at a put down.  So I quipped back snootily  "Why Michael is that how you get sales?   I love trading insults in jest, and I am finding he does too.  I have found a home in a really small click of me, Michael, and my fav gal Sam.  We have so much fun just being bitchy about everyone else in the office like our shit don't stink, we truly were made for each other.  It is so nice to fit into a group as a woman, I was so afraid I would never find my niche and I have by being a bitch.  Oh well off to bed, I am alright in my funk, so please don't prod.  I just have some stuff I need to work on, and some emotions and feelings I need to sort out, such is life.  Love to all, take care.

       A few words on rants...  Got a call yesterday from the only person brave enough to keep in contact with me from my old job telling me how much I upset my old co-workers with my rant the other day.  First of all I am flattered that almost 6 months latter that I am interesting enough for some folks to read almost every day.  I installed a program to see who is here and when a while back and it is interesting who is interested.  I know who the trouble maker is, hey tubby.  As for all those in the office that were hurt, read my words carefully, I attacked vendors, not you guys.  This is my last apology to you guys, I'm sorry you keep feeling hurt by words I say, but the aren't pointed at you.  Read MY words, if you have questions call ME, don't rely on hear say and innuendo to fill in the blanks.  I stand by all I write and any thing I write here I will say to your face or on the phone, trust me.  I guess I have my old boss mad at the guy who told me the info on his sales being down.  Calm down, I don't mention the company, the food or anything, he mentioned his business was down not yours. I wonder if the fact his business is down is due to the fact he isn't included in your demo program my old customers told me about? I am not in the business, I am not giving information to your competitors or anything else.  I never name real names when the information is something that can jeopardize anyone's business or life.  So just chill out ok.  I have been very nice in handling things all along.  I limped away when I left instead of fighting a battle in court, cut me some slack.  As for the new guy I called a flake, hey hun sorry, I am just getting information from some of your customers that I am still friends with.  I still shop for my animals at some of the stores you call on.  Some advice for you, customers like someone who will help them, have some good product knowledge etc, not put on a show for them, or put down their clientele.  I can't believe that 6 months latter I am still pissing folks off.  They are acting like I don't have the right to be pissed about what happened.  What happened really sucked, I won't forget it for the rest of my life.  I would rather move on, and I thought I had until it raised it's ugly head again.  If what you read here pisses you off, go else where to read shit.  There are over a billion other sites available on the net.  If you can't handle that I am pissed at you, too bad, I am very open with my feelings, and if you want to know why call or write me, don't just bitch to the person you hope will call me and stress her out.  I don't know what to do about certain trouble makers in this part of my life, but I have a few ideas.  I don't know why folks have to bother with me, when they should have enough shit in their own lives?  I mean Tubby has some pretty steep numbers to beat from last year from what I remember, he might want to focus more energy on his own life and work than mine.  As for everyone else, I have told you all how I feel, sorry for confusion.  Like I said this is the last apology I am writing to folks from that time in my life.  I am sure I am going to really piss off some of them when the book comes out next spring.  I won't be naming names exactly, but they will definitely know who they are.  So to anyone I piss off in the book, either you deserve it, or I am sorry in advance.  Heading to the beach with the fam to relax.  Love to all, and take care.

       Booyah...  Today was an awesome day indeed.  We had and inhouse sales contest for all the sales people.  The office was set up with a beach motif,and as I said this am, we got to dress casual.  It was hilarious when the other female sales gal showed up in the same coral colored capris I had on.  We are both tall for gals, and they kept teasing us we looked like sister's today, I laughed quietly inside to myself.  We broke off into 3 teams, and drew categories out of a hat and each team had to sell an ad for that category.  It started off slow for everyone and really slow for me, I don't know many of the accounts being the new girl.  One team sold the first two ads, and got the first two prizes.  The team that sold each of the first 4 ads got to pop a balloon and won the prize inside.  They won a night at Mohegan Sun's Hotel, and $50.  I was getting flustered, so I ate a snack, had some caffeine and refined my approach.  I ended up selling one right before lunch, we won a lottery ticket.  We ate a good lunch and then I went back to it and within a few minutes I had another one.  This time we won $50.  I went right back to it, I had the pitch down I had the angle down, I was back to be a selling machine like I was at my old company.  I sold 2 more in the next hour, I was doing great.  At the end of the day as a group all 8 of us had sold a total of 10 ads, I sold 5 of them myself.  I know it is mostly a male traight, but I really think I thrive on competition to really bring out my best.  I became my bosses star today she told me.  I laughed when they said "hey the  new girl  showed them up today".  They have no idea how new of a girl I really am.  I really enjoyed being able to excel again at work, today showed me my gift for sales is inside of me.  It doesn't matter that I am not a guy, I can sell no matter what.  I was starting to worry that I couldn't sell as well as a woman, I changed my mind today.  I still have a long battle ahead of me in getting to where I once was in my old profession, but I assure you I will be there once again.  I am working 2x as hard as the other reps, they are doing about 12 calls a day, I try to do a min of 20 visits and 12 calls a day.  I need to get my territory moving, the last two reps let it slide, and neither stayed long at all.  I know I won't see immediate results for my hard work, but it will pay off down the road, it always does.  Today was a nice day indeed, each day I am starting to feel like I really do fit in there more and more.  Slowly the old scars from my last career are healing, they will never be fully gone, but with each day they hurt a bit less.  G'nite, love to all.

       Just another day...  Wow today is my first casual in office day, I get to look like a bum in my own office, can't wait.  It actually took me longer to pick out some clothes for today than it does on a normal day, go figure.  I was going to go up to have coffee tonight with the Springfield group.  It is nice for them to invite me, I know a few of them, and I like being invited to meet new and interesting people.  I am just so damn beat from the last week that I doubt I am going this time.  I may take them up on the next offer, and I still might go tonight still, all depends on work.  I also think it is important to go since my friend who did the bad thing at support group will be there.  I need to see her and show her, no hard feelings as long as she keeps hands to herself.  It has been odd since the whole thing happened, I see her all the time online, but she never Im's and I don't like to push.  If you are reading this hun, it is ok to talk to me IF you want to, if not that's ok too.  I am just not going to be the one to start the conversations.  Things happen in this life all the time, if we chose not to forgive anyone who ever made a mistake we would all be holed up in our own individual caves somewhere holding shotguns to kill the bastard who tries to come in.  This is too short a life to not forgive, I don't forget, but I am not the type to rub things in either.    Oh well off to work, got some lovely telemarketing work to do today.  Love to all, take care.

       Details...  Ok first I am bushed, had the second job tonight for the first time solo for my section.  It took me just over 2 hours which is cool since I always get paid for 3 regardless.  I would have been done sooner if not for the fruitloop gal who cleans the other half of the offices getting mad at the vacuum and smashing it into the floor.  Her little tantrum bent the pan that covers the brush and belt drive and the brush wheel was rubbing hard against the pan.  I took it apart really quick and fixed it in about 10 minutes.  Unfortunately because I had to wait for her, and fix the machine it added some time to the day.  She was happy I fixed it for her.  She does know about me, she has worked for my mom for over 7 years and mom told her everything awhile ago.  She seems pretty cool with it, I only met her A.S (after Scott) so she doesn't know the male me.  I have found folks who know about your trans status but never dealt with the old you are usually allot cooler than those who did.  Ok now for the details on yesterday.. I felt bad afterwards but I had a little go around over the phone with an old work chum.  He was complaining how his numbers were down in my old region and that the idiot they replaced me with is pissing off lots of customers.  He started to get a little whoa is me, and I snapped, and pretty harshly.  My rant..  "Well I don't feel sorry for any of you vendors.  You guys did nothing when sparky let me go.  Nobody said boo, some like you gave your support to me personally and have stayed in touch, which I really appreciate, but nobody took him on.  You guys get what you deserve.  Nobody stuck up for me after all the hard work I did for you guys, if the new guy is a flake and is playing the "sales game" of staying under the boss's radar instead of working like I did, you deserve it.  Nobody stuck up for me, and I am pissed, so don't come crying to me about numbers. I have to declare bankruptcy, I lost a career, I lost everything.  Who shed a freaking tear for me?"    I felt bad for snapping at him, he is a good friend, he just happened to be in the wrong place at the right time.  He is one of the few folks from the industry I can without a doubt call friend, and I called to apologize to him today. I do feel very hurt for what went down, and how it happened, I am not bragging when I call myself top dog, or say I worked hard, I am being honest.  I got paid handsomely for growing my business, the harder I worked the more $ I had for transitioning.  I worked my ass off not only for my company's own good, but so that I could reach my goals. It is so ironic that the man who hated me so much that he got rid of me a week after finding out is probably most responsible for helping me get there. He set up the system that I used to make the most money I could,it worked and he profited well from it believe you me. I am sorry to tell him though that nobody else is going to work as hard as I did for him, it was my drive to be whole that made me work the long hours, do reports on Sundays, and put my job before shit it shouldn't have been in front of.  I'm sorry Mr. M, if you really want to grow the business again, hire some determined trannies, they work really hard for you, and you don't have to worry about any maternity leave either.  I am sorry to joke, I have heard lots of bad stuff about my old company, it's not like it used to be.  People who I used to compete against to be top dog are now on top with no competition and have gotten fatter and lazier. I hear little bits and pieces from different insiders in the biz, from all different angles, and while the company will be around for a very long time, a change is a coming for those not pulling their hefty weight. I hope they like potted meat and macaroni and cheese.  At work yesterday it was hilarious and spooky too.  I was up in our all female design department, and the girls started talking about men and how awful they are.  It got nasty.  Several of the gals had been cheated on, it turned to all men are scum, and shouldn't be trusted, can't train them etc.  It got to such a fevered pitch, it was almost like a scene out of the book  Lord of the Flies     "kill the man, slit his throat, badger it, badger it.."   I am glad I am in the tribe with the conch shell for now.  I feel very awkward in these situations, I can't give myself away, yet I feel wrong joining in the discussion, yet to walk away from a conversation where my fellow co worker is almost in tears as she talks about her husband sleeping around on her is not an option.  I just added "Hey you can never change a man" and got back to work.  I hope they are not onto me and trying to get me to crack, it ain't going to happen.  I'm waiting for the flack to come when they figure out my gay pride rainbow wave on the car.  I don't know what I will say when they do, but I'm not going to loose any sleep over it either.  We also need to welcome a new reader, Yosef who regrets his surgery and is blaming HBISOC for his transition failing.  Yosef found us by JR's site, and is a bit mad about her comments.  I started writing him a letter saying she was kidding, but I stopped and deleted it.  A. I don't speak for JR, she is a big girl and can handle herself.  B. Why do it, I have talked at length w/Yosef, we have reached an understanding, we don't hate each other like I think we once did.  We are on far ends of the spectrum on how to achieve things, but we both agree there are some problems with HBISOC.  He wants to put all the doctors out of business and make it almost impossible to get srs, I want to make sure people get more help before deciding on SRS and RLT etc.  I have seen lots of hurt folks, and I have been hurt myself, something needs to be fixed, not torn down, but fixed.  Yosef also has the problem that he isn't seeing all other points of view on things, he is using his own experiences as the standard, he thought this was for him, and it wasn't so we are all wrong, not true.  This has been working for me as tough as it has been, does that mean it is right for everyone, no.  I also disagree with his assumption that all of us can be cured of our wrongly assumed afflictions. I tried that first, before doing the transition part.  I went through my counseling, I tried with all I had to not have to transition even though I knew it was the right thing to do.  I did all that, I turned to God, unfortunately it didn't work.  I wish it had, I could use the company of my wife every night, I miss my house, my kids, my friends, counseling and praying didn't work for me, they might for some, but not everyone.  I once wrote how I was going to share with you all my letters back and forth with Yosef, I am not going to anymore, I feel sorry for him.  He down deep is a good soul, I found it even though we were trading some pretty nasty emails.  Yosef has been through enough in his life, I wish him well, and hope he finds happiness someday.  I hate to tell him, he isn't going to bring down HBISOC, all he is going to do is have to relieve an awful time in his life over and over again with each battle he chooses to fight.  I hope he will realize it before it gets too much for him to bear.  Good luck Yosef, hope you find what you are looking for.   Oh well long night, and another in store for tomorrow.  May you all find a little bit more happiness and peace tomorrow... damn I must of doubled up on my Celexa again.  G'nite and love to all.

       Busy, busy, busy...  Sorry folks I feel guilty when I don't get a chance to blog, but yesterday and this am have been event filled.  I will get to the good stuff tonight, late, but I will fill you in really quick now on a few things.  After work(which most of the excitement happened, check back tonight) I went to my Gp's for a little month after getting out of the looney bin check up.  He is so sweet and is truly concerned about me.  I had to promise him that if I thought of doing that shit again I would call him no matter what time or day and have him paged.  I am blown away by his kindness.  He has been my Dr. forever, and is the old fashioned small town Dr. type.  Somebody else broke him in on the tranny thing, I am his second patient like this, thank God.  But it was really nice, and he asked the best question..."so when you come back to________, does any body recognize you?  I can't see how they would or anything?"  Wow here is a man who takes care of lots of people giving me a big vote of confidence that I look like a real woman, that is cool.  After the appointment I flew down and changed to go to a local concert in the park.  I wasn't going to go, but my straight friend K has a way of getting me to do shit.  It is funny we dated like over 16 years ago, and she still knows the right buttons to push with me, the girl has a gift.  The concert was pretty cool, an oldies group that will remain nameless.  A little before it was done, this older gentleman who was walking by, stops says hi, gives a quick look and a smile, I said hi back and he moves on.  K was beside herself   "I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it... I thought you were imagining things"...   she went on flustered.  "That guy was just flirting with you..."   I'm not sure why she was doubting me, but it was nice to know that at least now she believes me.  K still sees me as me, whoever that is, and has trouble with seeing me as Ash.  Hey at least she talks to me.  After the concert we went back to her house and just sat in the driveway and talked about lots of shit till after 11pm.  She is truly concerned about Co, who has been her friend longer than I, and we talked a bit about her, and stuff in general.  I like having straight friends too, nothing against my tranny bro's and sisters, but we all need some straight friends to hang out with too.  I hope I can get more of the straight ones to meet the tranny ones soon, they all seem to be good people.  Love to all, take care.

       Busy weekend...  Mom and I decided Sat. am to do the tag sale after we had decided Friday not to do so.  We ran around like chickens with our heads cut off getting ready. It was ok, mom made good $ for a tag sale, I made like  $15, wow.  Yesterday and this am we spent getting the house and the yard ready for our cookout, lots of grunt work.  This am we also had to run and do the weekend cleanup job over at her 2nd job.  On the way home we went and picked up one of those big gazebo tents.  It was a pretty big and heavy box, maybe 15-20lbs. I am pretty strong still when the adreniline is going and I quickly picked it up with one arm without a struggle and freaked out a the lady who witnessed it.  She gave me the oddest look, I don't know if I exposed myself to being made, nor do I really give two shits, but the look on her face was pretty horrific and not good for my self esteem.  The picnic went well, there was a little argument that I wish hadn't happened, and I feel at least partially responsible for starting. I won't get into details but I had two passionate friends on opposite sides of the spectrum of being able to go into certain areas.  I agree with the gen friend more than the tranny one, we must be careful to walk carefully and lightly through where we trod, and not bully our way like what we were in our old lives.  We are trying to be women, we need to act with a bit more dignity and caution if we ever want to get there.  I did agree with my tranny friend a bit though too, in the respect that there needs to be a time when we finally get to "join the club" and be accepted at least as a woman on some level. Not gen, but not men anymore either.  One of my tranny friends really made my friend K upset.  K is a little bit big boned, but all girl, and gen.  My distant friend TM asked her if she was trans or gen.  My friend K was pretty upset and from what I heard went home and got more upset over the whole thing.  I really hope K isn't scared off by her, TM meant no harm, and K looks like a woman, TM was just going to ask her for her secrets if she was a tranny.  Overall it was a success, mom, my uncle, my cousin all met a bunch of my tranny friends and was cool with it all.  I am very lucky to have a very understanding family, and I am very thankful for them.  Co and the kids did great too.  I tried to get a picture of JR playing in the puddles with my kids, but by the time I got my camera she had stopped.  It would have made a great pic too.  Co really liked meeting some more of the people I have been talking so highly of these last 6 months.  She liked them all, I am glad she is still with me in some capacity in the wasteland.  I hope to have a few other picnics this summer, I hope they all go as well.  G'nite, love to all, take care.

       Happy 4th...  I love this holiday, it has great meaning to me, and will always be a special day in my heart.  On this day a few hundred years ago a small group of folks banded together to battle oppression, and tyranny.  It is a fine example that shows what a small group of folks with compassion, persistence and a cause can accomplish.  It is a shame that after they won the battle they just did the same shit they were fighting about.  It doesn't matter, I know the founding fathers were a bunch of white European, male oppressors, that is not what today is about.  Today is about the birth of a nation where people can be more free than any other nation in the world.  As imperfect as we are everyday folks risk their lives to try and get in.  We are held as a shining example of a democracy that works around the free world.  Today is the day we put our differences aside and celebrate our oneness and uniqueness in this world.  Tomorrow we can get back to making plans for the overthrowing of another tyrant named George, this time through peaceful election.  May God and the universe grant you and yours a safe and happy 4th as we celebrate our freedom.  Happy 4th of July to all.   And heres to over 15 years to someone who has been my best friend and hopefully always will be.  Love you Co.

       Nouveau Duality...  I have lived with duality of lives my whole life.  For years I hid my distaste with being a male and my secret crossdressing practices.  I had to have a public very tough face on while secretly yearning to just be me, a female.  I had to put on a face I hated.  I had to do lots of things I really only did to survive and fit into society and stay under the radar.  The stress of duality really took it's toll on me, and led me to do some pretty bad stuff to my body, the worst was 17 years of smoking.  Now I have a nouveau duality and I actually like it.  I am having to deal with the two different sides of the new me, or the real me.  There is soft and pretty girl Ash, who dresses up nicely for work and fits into society.  Then there is the other side of me, the side that likes to drive fast, the part of me that misses contact sports and competition, the part of me that likes to smoke cigars every once in awhile. Of course there is also the part of me that really wants to make mad passionate love,(not with my present equipment, thank you) to folks like Co, and still fantasizes about wild nights with gals like Gina Davis, or Terry Clark, not to mention I could have some fun with Gretchen Wilson too, I could make her into a redneck lesbian woman. There is the part of me that loves to put together the perfect outfit and get my hair just right, and the part of me that loves to swing a hammer or go dig in the garden.  I really shouldn't let it bother me so much the only thing that says a girl shouldn't like to do some of the shit I do is society and they already don't approve of my life so who cares?  I like being a bit rough, I don't care if I am looked down on or not, I am being true to myself for the first time in my life....  There is something that is bothering me though about being true.  I feel horrible for having to lie to the girls at work when they ask me about my husband and my kids.  I really hate to lie to them all the time and just shortly mention "my ex nick".  I am very tempted to make up a bigger lie to stop lieing about Co.  I am thinking of telling them my ex is not a man, we were a same sex couple, co is my kids mother, and there father is my dead twin bro "Scott".  It seems horrid taking a step back and looking at it as a whole.  I hate lieing to people, I don't even do it in my job I shoot straight with my customers and that's how I earn their respect and eventually their business.  It is part of my "passing priviledge".  If I didn't appear to be a normal woman and appeared to be trans I wouldn't have to lie about my past.  It is a catch 22, either you don't pass enough to blend into society, or you pass enough to blend and have to invent a pass to fit in.  Ain't a trannies life great?  I hope in my next life I get to have a little bit better of lot...  Love to all, take care.

       Drive...  MMMM my new favorite Sobe.  Strawberry grape with ginseng and some shit I can't pronounce or spell.  I really don't need more drive, I just like the flavor and the nutrients in there.  Tonight is an example of my new drive as I start my new job.  It's not much of a job, only 15 hours a week cleaning for the same company mom works for.  The offices I will be cleaning are right around the corner from where I live.  The nice part is I will be able to afford going back to electrol again soon, the bad news is I'll be working.  My fav zapping lady does it Monday and Wednesday nights, nights I will be working.  I will figure something out, I need the extra income.  I may even need a third job down the road, but I am not going to let myself get discouraged or let anything dampen that drive I have.  I need every ounce of it to get where I need to go in this life.  I wish mom had the same drive sometimes, she has decided she isn't ready for the tag sale.  I told her we were, but she is insisting she isn't so we will have to wait another week. Seriously I really shouldn't blame her, mom has worked two or more jobs since I can remember, she is most likely where I get my drive from.   GO MOM!     Oh well, gives me more time to cook for Monday I guess, and now I can take the kids down to the park tomorrow while Co goes and gets some much needed alone time.  She deserves it so much more than anyone else I know.  Even though I highly doubt we will ever be in the same kind of relationship ever again, I love how we are best friends still.  I care very much about her and want to see her happy, even if that means her spending her life with someone else.  Who knows what will happen down the road, I am just enjoying the company of a good friend while she is willing to share it.  Love to all, and take care.

       A different dilemma...  I know it sounds weird to be happy to have a dilemma, but I am of sorts happy to have my latest.  The other day I raised a stink over the touching of my ass by someone who is into women, and in front of my spouse.  I got really mad that it happened, women shouldn't be treated like that, etc...  Well yesterday I had to go see a difficult male customer who habitually is late with his copy and keeps me at work until after 7 every Wednesday night.  So I picked out a nice low cut blouse to wear, with a zipper, and wore a flesh colored tank under it.  When I went in to see my buddy the butcher, I lowered my zipper a little bit more.  He got a nice cleavage show, and I got my copy quicker then normal.  But then it hit me on the way home.  How can I talk about women not being sexual objects and then go out and act like one?  What gives women the right to do it?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not the type that agrees with the "oh she deserved to be date raped, look at that outfit" bullshit defense, but seriously.  How can a woman be expected to be taken as a serious equal who is not a sexual object if we continue to use sex as a weapon?  I didn't sleep with the guy to get my way, but I showed more skin for him.  I really don't know how to think on this one.  I have worked very hard to lose weight and take good care of myself so I look good, I do want to show off my hard work.  On the other hand I need to find the line where I can look good, without demeaning myself into a boob flashing, skirt hiking little sales girl.  Just because I have this opinion too doesn't mean I condone what happened the other day, I was in jeans, and dammit we were in a support group!  I do understand a little bit better both sides of the sword now though.  That is one of the good things that has come out of living parts of my life in both sexes, I have gotten to see things from most angles.  I will need time to reflect on this one a little bit more for now.  As I said in my open this is a nice dilemma to have, that of a woman, not a trans person.  99% of the world treats me as a woman, most folks don't know, so in more ways than not I am a woman.  I know I will always have my trans issues to deal with, but it is nice to be getting some new stuff to fret over instead of rehashing through old shit continuously.  I hope I am able to slay these dragons as well.  I did sleep ok the other night thanks to exercise, but was not as lucky last night.  Yesterday I bought the new Sobe Courage.  It was excellent, cherry flavor, had some nutricuticals for more energy.  Unfortunately it also contained 78 grams of caffeine, add that to the 2 cokes I had and I had like 5 times my normal caffeine consumption.  I was high energy all day, still am just a bit.  I fell asleep fine, but kept waking up. Last night it was 4 or 5 times, all about 30 minutes each.  So as much as I love the lizard, I will stay away from that one except for late night recovering the day after. For now I will have to continue looking for my perfect Sobe. I might need my Courage though for getting through the tag sale on Saturday, a sad day on Sunday, and my cookout on Monday.  Sunday is a mixed day for me and Co. It is the 15th anniversary of when I first asked her out, at a friends picnic as we sat on a bench swing together, way back in 1989.  We were talking last night about it, and I think it is another good type of anniversary, that of our friendship.  We were best friends before we even started dating,and we are again after the end of our marriage, so I guess from now on every July 4th we can celebrate our years and eventually decades of friendship.  Love to all, take care.

       Ok,Ok, I put it back on...  Today wasn't the best day at work, and my discussion with my boss got me to bring back the comment feature. She was telling me to be careful what I say about my life in the office, I fully agree. I guess she heard some buzz and was telling me the girls wanted to know why my old name was Norman. Now here lies the problem I obviously was never named Norman. The overheard conversation was between me and an ally at work that figured me out awhile ago, and only had the balls to approach me recently. Norman is her ex brother in law in more ways than one. Norman was her ex husbands bro and is now Heather. So someone overhearing us talk about her family turns into me talking about my life. I got a bit pissed about the whole thing and I do guess I do need to be aware that the walls have ears, albeit ones that don't hear straight. I am not really all that worried about it getting too out of hand. I am just going to ignore the buzz go about my life and keep things very quiet. I have found that if you make too big of a stink about shit you tend to stick out. My buddy C at the game slipped on a pronoun, and annouced "he"(meaning me) was ordering more drinks and wanted to know if there were any requests. I ignored him and it wasn't a big deal. By just ignoring it, C looked like he simply misspoke instead of anyone thinking I was a he. I learned this awhile ago, and it has served me well to keep my mouth shut, even though I am dieing inside. So I will just lay low, and not talk to her anymore about that shit in the office.  This is where I got really pissed though. I have to listen about someone who is having a hard time with their SO or their life and bore me with all the details of their "crummy life", and I can't even have a private conversation about mine, because someone might eavesdrop. I don't know if my boss is bullshitting me about how accepting she is of me, or what? I don't plan on going anywhere yet, and hope to be there a long time. It is good a few people know so that if she were to railroad me out, there is someone who knows the real story to stop it from happening in the first place. So talk away, share your comments, I want to give you the opportunity to put in your 2 cents, no censorship here. But flamers beware, I flame back, and I am heavy on the gasoline.  I also ended up selling my other boat today, and now am without marine vehicles for the first time in over a decade. I am a bit depressed. I am an outdoorsy person by nature, but the little but heavy boats I had were not right for me anymore. I may buy a lightweight kayak or something, but I am in no rush. I don't quite get why I sold both of them without any haggling. I don't know if men are afraid to haggle with women, if they were scared by how easily I threw the boats around, or if they felt sorry for my divorce sob story. Maybe as a few of my friends keep telling me, I am just a good sales person. It is nice to feel good about yourself in doing mudane type shit like selling stuff in the paper.  I also am going to apply for a different night job, in fact a dream job. It has been my dream ever since I was a kid to drive the zamboni. Yes I want to be the person driving that cool invention that makes the ice nice and smooth. The ice rink is a customer of mine, and called me to run the ad. I asked when they needed folks? ,nights , and how much$?,  better than I make cleaning . I am going down tomorrow to apply for the job. The lady who runs the rink is a sweetheart and is the one who invited me to try out for the women's hockey team. I hope like hell I get this job, I would actually pay them to do the job, but keep that our little secret. I will have to let you know how it all goes.  Tomorrow night I am playing hostess at the Gicne meeting. We are trying to go to let the folks know there is a support group out there, and try to calm them down for the meetings. Going before the board is one of the most intense things one must do in this journey. I am not a big cheerleader type to try and encourage anyone to come join the "big party", but if they are here and need someone to talk to I am here. This is not a fun trip and allot of folks just need someone to talk to.  I also am doing some more consultant work for my contact in Fla. I have been sent promotional material and I am now the front person for this project. I don't know how I keep going with all the jobs, but it seems to keep me out of trouble.  No rest for the wicked, I will never let the bastards wear me down, and I will sleep when I am dead.    GD, now even I think I sound butch!    Love to all , speak up, and take care.

       Finally trouble with "the man"...   Ok I had my first real issue at my new job today with the big boss aka "the man."  I wore what I thought was an appropriate albeit short dress today that he thought differently on.  He didn't have the courage to tell me himself, I don't blame him I'm like 4+ inches taller than him without the heels.  But he had a talk with my boss who had a talk with me.  As much as I do disagree on the length of the dress, which BTW is between a mini and a knee length, I will happily respect their request and not wear that to work again.  I really think it is hilarious that I got a talking to for dressing too promiscuously, it really makes me laugh my ass off.  Oh well maybe I am getting a little taste of what a teenager goes through in getting into trouble as I try to find my way and my place.  Life is good when I all I have to worry about in my own life is this kind of menusha.  On the serious side of things, Shel did get released from the hospital today, and is resting comfortably in her place of recoupment.  She still has a battle to fight, and she will fill all of you in who happen to read her blog.  For now she sends her love and wants you all to know she is ok.  I also got to talk for quite awhile to an old friend who recently moved to Florida.  He recently had a bad breakdown like I had back in May.  We were close in HS, and I am glad that we have reconnected through our common tragedies.  I think he is a nice guy, and even though he hasn't met the new me, he is very supportive.  I will have to go see him one day when I can afford to fly down to FL. for the weekend.  I also get to meet another old HS/hockey buddy tomorrow night for the first time. I have the skybox to entertain again and I invited him with the extra ticket I had. I hope it goes well.  It will be an interesting night either way.  I will let you all know how it all goes down.  I have allot of other stuff I would love to write about, but I am trying really hard to refocus my writing energy into the book, so I will wait.  G'nite and love to all.

       Making long sweet love...   To my shower that is.  No I am not actually having sex with my shower, but being able to take a nice warm shower felt so damn good yesterday and even today.  I soaked up the warmth and enjoyed it more than I normally would.  There were shower facilities available at the campgrounds, and I know the subject has started intense debate in the past.  But this is the bottom line.  With me being a pre-op, I do not feel comfortable using an all female facility involving nakedness.  I don't feel it is appropriate, and I will only start using such facilities involving open nakedness after surgery.    So now that I have once again stated my stance on the whole thing, I just didn't feel right so I didn't take one.  Would I have loved to take a shower?  You bet you ass I would, but there are just some things that are even taboo to me.  I am trying to tred very lightly in this journey as far as acceptance to female inclusive areas.  I think so far it has worked out good.  Of course I have tried to tred very lightly in this whole thing, but of course those who don't agree with me(hyde park) think just the opposite. In fact I have been accused of being difficult, blaming, hateful and even I am sure the "enemy". Not a single person from the job I did so well for over 4 years will even talk to me. Oh well, I guess it was wrong for me to get a bit upset when I had to leave the job I loved, and throw my whole career down the toilet just because a few folks were uncomfortable with me.  Oh wait a second, f that shit, I can be pissed if I want to be.  Hey I wish them well, and I can't make them see what they don't want to see, so let them think what they want.  I do wish it had turned out different, but life somehow never to works out the way we want it to.  Oh well gotta split and get ready for the big meat grinder of work.  Love to all, and of course take care.

       Knee slapping good time...   This weekend was pure heaven.  Good food, good friends, great weather, and some shit kicking music with lots of folks picking and grinning(some toothless folks too.) There was lots to see and soak up, I spent too much $ like I always do.  I did buy a beautiful batik print dress with moon and stars and a Peruvian clay flute with a kokapeli on it.  We got to see some really good acts from the front row, and really had a great time.  I made a new friend and found some new bands I enjoy, I will post them soon.  Even if you don't like bluegrass you do owe it to yourself to go give a listen to a few of the bands.  So much of modern rock and roll and country flows out of bluegrass.  It is like jazz in that it tends to flow from the soul, and is a bit grittier (if that is a word) than most music.  I love music that has a heart of its own or that is played with heart.  I feel the energy that goes into the process and love to soak it all in.  I am planning already for next year, and it is going to be an awesome time for sure.  Hopefully we will have a little bit warmer weather at night.  The record lows Saturday night made for a long and cold night.  Thanks to my kids busting one of the zippers on my tent the cold had an easy time coming in. I slept in allot of clothes and covered up tight.  It wasn't too bad while I was covered, but OMG when the covers came off I froze. Oh well I did worse when I was homeless back in my late teens, and I know I could very well end up there again someday too, so it helps me appreciate my warm bed that much more.  Shel is doing ok for all who are interested.  She is getting out of the hospital shortly to continue her recovery at home.  I hope you guys continue to keep her in all your prayers.  She says she will be back blogging as soon as she can manage to sit comfortably at her desk, but it might be a week or so.  I visited her a few times in the hospital and she seems in very good spirits indeed.  She sends her love and thanks you all for you love and concern.  I have another busy week, with the 2 jobs, hosting another night at the ballpark and being an ambassador for the GICNE meeting.  We are all heading up to a friends cottage up north next weekend.  I will enjoy that, I haven't been able to spend as much time with my friend as of late, so I am looking forward to it.  I am not looking forward to putting on my bathing suit though, I have put on 6lbs in the last month, not sure what is going on, but I have let my discipline fly out the window in trying to keep up with a busy schedule.  I need to crack the whip on myself and keep myself on track.  I didn't change my whole life and loose all the weight only to put it back on.  I felt good at my weight I need to get back there, and I will.  If I can just stop slacking off I will be just fine.  Love to all, take care, and keep me away from egg and cheese bagels and ice cream ok?

       Ok really quickly...   Stopped in for a really quick visit with Shel, she got thru surgery ok, but is in allot of pain as expected.  I will get to visit her again tomorrow for just a bit, but may not get to write about it much.  This weekend is a busy one, I have a Doctors appointment tomorrow evening, then have to go clean, go home and pack for Podunk.  I am working all day Friday and grabbing my daughter, and going to Podunk right after work for the weekend.  It should be fun, and I don't know how much blogging I will do.  But I do offer this advice to anyone who is concerned about her, use the no news is good news philosophy on this one.  If there is something bad to report I assure you I will let you all know ASAP, so if I don't blog, it means she is ok.    Love to all, take care and enjoy life.

       Shel's big day...     Well I will keep it very solemn this morning, as today is Shel's big surgery day. It isn't the surgery that she was looking forward too, but if it wasn't for this surgery to save her life, the other wouldn't be happening next June for her. I hope all who read this will say a little prayer for her, even those who come in just to check in on me and then twist my words in reporting to an old boss. If you are reading this and don't have enough heart to say a little prayer for my friend, I hope you come down with the same affliction she has.  Friends are precious gifts, you cannot go down to any store and buy one. Good ones are very hard to find indeed, and once you have them it is hard to keep them due to the business of modern life. Forgive me if I get a little over protective of my friends, but I am.    Good luck my friend may God help you through this hard time in your life, and help make you stronger and more able to once again take on the world. We all pray for your quick recovery, and look forward to our next time together  .  Love to all, and take care.

       Just one of those days I guess...   Today was one of those action packed days I would rather live without.  It all started this am as I was scrambling to grab a refill for my check book I grabbed the set with the misspelled name of  Ashely , and they did me no good at all today.  On my way in as I was stopped at a light and taking off my jacket as I put down the cell phone, I heard the God awful sound of screeching tires.  As I looked up I witnessed 1 really big pick up truck hit one mid sized car almost head on.  He hit more on the side and actually ripped the whole tire off her car and sent it flying over 10 feet in the air.  I ended my call and called 911 really quick and stopped to make sure folks were fine.  I am not an emt, so I left knowing enough other people had stopped to help out.  I hope all are ok and not too banged up from the nasty looking crash.  Seeing shit like that scares me.  I am in the car much more than most folks, even though I am not on the road as much now as I was before.  Before I did around 200-300 miles on an average day some days almost 500, now I do less than 100.  But that still is more than the average person drives daily for work. I am pretty sure when my time comes it will be in the car.  That doesn't stop me from driving though, when it is my time, death will find me, driving or cowering in a corner afraid of life, so I might as well live. I did one of those mortality tests back when I worked for the big company and it said from the amount of miles I drove I was 400 times more at risk to die in a car wreck than the average person.  Of course it also told me I was exercising too much, and back then I was smoking so I think I came back with a life expectancy in the low 60's, lovely thought ey?  I should go back on and take it again, I will have to search for it.  So I get to work and I start experiencing trouble with my zipper.  I would zip it up, it would work it's way back down.  It was frustrating, it is not like they were too tight, they are actually too big for me. Oh did I mention the zipper was the only thing that held up my pants also,so it was a little bit more than just a nuisance.  So I keep fighting all day with the zipper and as I am going into customer #9 for the day as I am going to zip back up the pants,   pop  goes the zipper head, sucker broke right off.  Thank God I had my hand back there to hold them up or else allot of people in Wethersfield may have gotten a free show, and not one most want to see.  I awkwardly made my way back to my car and searched for a safety pin.  The only one I found was a total piece of shit and wouldn't hold them together.  So here I am, pants that won't stay up with appointments to go see, and no real way to go get a new pair of pants because the ones I have won't stay up.  So I look around the car and have my McGuiver moment.  I happened upon a roll of white hockey tape that I keep in the car for quick repairs of things.  I took the tape and made a belt of sorts by taping the pants all the way around the waist.  It was a good temporary fix and I hustled into TJ Max with my blazer pulled down low and my purse and my had strategically placed over the hole showing off my ass to the general public.  I was a bit worried people would stop and stare, they were black pants, it was white tape, but beggars cannot be choosers.  I got a pair of pants went in to try them on and let the attendant know I would be wearing them out.  She started to give me lip until I turned around and showed her the state of my pants.  She happily agreed.  When I got out she had to call the service desk and the little girl behind the counter was laughing before I got up there.  She rings me up with a smirk on her face, and I send her into laughter with "  Wardrobe malfunction.   I am just glad I didn't give a show like Miss Jackson did.  All in all it worked out, I even laughed my ass off at myself for a few minutes afterward.  Only me would have something like that happen, and solve it with white hockey tape.  After work I went out for a really nice quick dinner with Shel and we went over some stuff in case the worse were to happen.  I have no plans on having to carry her wishes out, she will do just fine and live for many years to come I am sure, but if it helps her feel at ease I will do it.  If by chance it did happen I of course would comply with her wishes to the best of my abillities, so she need not worry one bit if she reads this.  Afterwards I stopped into a little pet store to get something for the damn fleas the cats keep bringing in.  I am talking to the clerk in the flea isle when out of the corner of my eye I catch this low flying  rather large blue and gold macaw flying low, being chased by a golden retriever puppy.  I guess the bird came in with a customer and the store dog decided to try and catch it.  I ducked just in the nick of time, he barely missed me and knocked a bunch of lightweight stuff onto me that was on the top shelf.  I helped the kid and the customer round up the parrot and made my way home.  I had enough for one day, hopped in my jammies and not going anywhere, it's just not an enjoyable day to be me. At least I survived it all, and I get to live another day.  Oh well we all have those days where shit happens allot and today was my day.  Love to all and take care.

       Preparation Ash...     Ok I couldn't pass up on that title, especially since I am such a pain in the ass lately. This week is full of preparation. I am preparing to take my little girl camping, I have a check in with my shrink and need to prepare which things I need to talk about with her, a priority list of sorts. I am also preparing for the major surgery on a friend. My good friend Shel is stricken with colon cancer and undergoes life saving surgery tomorrow. I am trying my best to prepare to be strong for her, as she was for me while I was in the hospital. She put a notice on her blog that I am the contact site for updates on her health, so if you came over from her site, welcome in, set your self down and enjoy the ride. Shel will be ok, she is in the hand of good dr's, but she is also entrusting me with handling her affairs if the worse happens. I also have to prepare myself for that God awful scenario. I told her I would do it, so I damn well be ready to do it if it does indeed happen. I don't like having to go back on my word, especially to a friend.  I'm also trying to get things back on track towards a date with surgery. So much had been put on hold just to get back on my feet again. It is time to start making the big plans once again, life has gotten as normal as it will get for me any time soon. It is nice to be mentally better than I was before I came out last January. I hope to be better than I have ever been by the time I hit the 35 in January. I have seen lots of good progression in myself not only as I am finding my way in life as a woman, but as a "normal" person for the first time in my life. I have finally found my place, and so far it is a nice fit. I wish I could of found that fit in my old male life, I tried for so many years to make it work, and with it not working out I have lost many things I held dear. I never chose to have a life like this, I would have much rather had one a bit more ordinary. Speaking of my old life, I am once again picking up the pen and paper to work on the book on it. I am still only on 1987, and I also need to go back and work on the late 70's on one little area. This is the hardest part of the book to write. It was in 1988 that I met Co for the first time. It was in 89 we became best friends and later that year started dating. I tried like hell with her to make things fit, and in the process forever scarred the love of my life. I can't ever fix that, and it hurts just a bit to say the least. I need to write my story, if for nothing more than expelling my demons. I do think I have a good and interesting life story, but that will be for someone else to decide.  Love to all, take care, and go soak up that sunshine.  Oh and when you have a big pain in the ass, think of  preparation Ash....

       Its a man, its a lady, no it's   PURSE MAN !!!...            Ok I haven't pissed off my cd friends lately, so I think it is ok to share with you this story from today.   I was beating the streets for my job today when I took a much deserved break at one of my favorite consignment stores in Rocky Hill, which will remain nameless, when I observed an odd looking fellow with a purse. I was a bit uncomfortable at first, I don't know why, but one should choose what sex they wish to portray and not mix them was my gut feeling on this one. I thought about it as I walked around the store, and then thought about it differently. If I didn't think it was right for him to walk around with a purse, what gave me the right to try and be whole? So I came to terms and smiled at purse man as I passed him and his designer $200 purse as he perused the women's jewelry, he didn't smile back. I don't know what made him want to genderfuck folks, but hey that's his deal, it shouldn't affect me any. So I find a couple of nice dresses, both really short, one too small it turns out, for like $4.50 combined, quite a steal indeed. I proceed to the check out and purse man is front of me. The little teenage clerk behind the counter asks Purse Man " Are you all set ma'am?"  He snipes back " Yes and that's  SIR NOT MA'AM !".   He just about bit her damn head off. I then lost all respect for Purse Man. It is ok to go around with a purse if you wish, but you shouldn't get you panties in a bunch if you weigh 120lbs, wear tons of jewelry, have longish hair, and oh yeah carry a purse. What do you expect people to call you when you are presenting as a woman? There is no need to bite peoples heads off when they read the signals you have decided to send. It would be like me thinking the whole world should stop because some male pig customer calls me honey now that I am working as a woman. It happens, we all need to live with it. Me getting called honey when I am all dolled up is no different from you being called ma'am because you have a purse. And now that poor little clerk is going to have this negative image of trannies because of this guy. Is he a tranny? Not sure, nor does it matter, he is sure to get grouped in with the rest of us. Thanks Purse Man, great job. Next time I stick with my first instincts.  I also had the first time since I have been living as a woman that I did not feel safe. I was at a light at the end of the expressway near my home when this truck with two young men pulled up behind me. Now I learned a long time ago a bit about reading lips from a childhood friend who was deaf. It isn't much and it helps when the person talking is loud and talking with passion, as they seem to take there time pronouncing shit. So these two schmucks pull up behind me and the passenger notices my " Jesus loves you, but I'm his favorite"  bumper sticker. I can see them talking about it and then the driver butts in about my other stickers. " Yeah that is funny...the wave one means the driver is a FAG or a DYKE." "What's the equal sign". Shoulder shrug..."Don't know."  Of course reading lips is made easier by reading body language especially when the people talking like to use their bodies to talk allot. They then got into something about "fucking Faggots" and "against God, etc." I wasn't sure if they were going to start trouble or not. Two pretty big dudes against me meant no trouble, I wasn't stopping for nothing if they tried something. The old me would have egged them on into confrontation, the new me is smart enough to know which battles are winnable and which are not. It was sobering though to see how folks still see gay people. Even after all the strides that have been made towards getting some sort of equality. It shouldn't be surprising though. Lincoln freed the slaves in the 1800's and black people are still discriminated against daily. Gay folks will never be fully accepted in this society. As much as that sucks, we need to remember it and be cautious in public. There are too many folks killed because of their belonging or perceived belonging to the GLBT community. If we all try to be a bit more cautious we can hopefully cut down on those numbers just a bit. This world isn't safe for us, so we need to be just a bit more cautious than most folks.  G'nite, love to all, and be carefull out there.

       Beantown, in the guise of a NY soccer mom...     Our weekend trip to Boston was a nice one indeed. Mom rented a beautiful Buick Rendevouz SUV to make the trip a little bit more comfortable. Of course me being the lover of the open road was the chauffeur for our little excursion. It was so interesting to be on the other side of the glass. A woman driving an SUV, I felt my perceived IQ drop 20 points the second I got behind the wheel. Add the NY plate to the car, and you got trouble. The odd thing was nobody tried bullying me around like my usual Boston trips. I don't know if it was the vehicle, the plate, the driver or all three.  We headed up to Weymouth, Paul's hometown, and visited with his childhood friend and got to visit some of their old haunts. This was a nice trip for mom to take. It was emotional to say the least. At the park where Paul and Andy used to play mom broke down, I was playing with the kids in the rocks I found a nice heart shaped rock and gave it to her as a memento. She took it gave me a big hug and dried her tears. I am so glad that mom had us come with her for this trip back to remember the man she loved so much. I have to say I think I have earned a new appreciation for Paul after his departure from this world. My mom loved him allot, and has shed many tears for him, she wouldn't do that for a jerk. And I know he loved her allot, and that somewhere he is watching over her, and trying to make things a wee bit easier for her. I hope he can do it, she deserves it.  We also took a side trip up to Salem, and took the kids to Salem Willows Amusement park. This place is a blast from the past. It is more a boardwalk than an amusement park. There are 3 arcades, a few little kids rides, a few eateries, a pier, and a beautiful park. Co and I have taken the kids there before, and it is such a great place for families. So many people just packed a picnic, ate in the park, went down and crabbed or fished off the pier, and then had some fun in the arcarde. It harkens you back to a different time, a simpler time, without all the troubles of today. My favorite things are the old penny and dime machines. They have the dancing monkey band, where for a dime a band of monkeys play a Mexican tune for you. And all the penny love testers (I'm naughty but nice in case you were wondering),  and other gadgets that make you feel like a little kid again. Overall it was a great weekend.  After returning I had to run down to Radio Shack for a few supplies so I could finnish making the dc party lights for camping next weekend. I went in and this 30 something year old geeky boy comes over to help me, and he starts talking down to me like I am too stupid to find the door back out. So he asks me what I'm looking for. I reply " Well let's see, I need about 6 12 volt leds with enough candlepower, or most likely a different rating at that size. Some terminals, a knife switch, some rosin free soder. Oh if we don't have the leds hopefully you'll have enough low voltage halogen lamps that won't draw too many amps as to draw down my batteries too fast."  He looked puzzled at that point, so I didn't add the variable resistor that I was thinking of getting to dim the lights. He asked what I was making, and told me it wouldn't work. I told him how I was going to do it, and he was impressed. He is a bit at odds with my knowledge, (and trust me it is basic at best). He then asks me if my husband is an electrician or something. I simply told him that a. I wasn't married, b. I took 2 years of electronics in HS., and c. I did my own household wiring in all the remodeling we did in my old house. He started back with his weak "oh yeah I can do low voltage stuff, like installing car audio." But I noticed he became really interested in me. We talked geek for a few moments, I could sense his interest growing with every ongoing sentence. I was sure by how he switched his stance like he did, he was now sporting wood. If I had told him that my elf lord had 10, 000 power points, I'm sure he would have had a wet dream right there. (  sorry to pick on all you D&D geeks, I never even picked up a die for your game or what ever you guys call it.   ) I finished my business and made my way out. I laughed all the way back to the car. I am still getting used to all the shit involved with being a woman, good and bad. It is weird how I manage to turn some heads so far, and others barely pay attention to me. Hey it is nice just be accepted as a woman. It has made me feel "real" even though in most respects I will never truly be a real 100% woman. All I can do is try to be me and make the best of things.  I am real, the real me, not 100% man or woman, but some odd but still relevant person in between.  The best I can hope for is to be treated like a real woman by most of society and get the surgery that will bring me as close physically as I can get to real in this lifetime.       Oh speaking of SRS, our SUV was equipped with a fancy radio that displayed the call letters of most stations, along with song titles and artists. It was pretty neat indeed. Well the one station we listened to the most was 96.1(if memory serves me right) and more importantly as Co pointed out to me the call letters were WSRS. Hmm, they are liberal up in Mass aren't they?   I am sure it wasn't for the surgery most likely  "Something, Radio, Station."   It is just another one of those silly little things that keep coming my way to make things just a bit more livable.   Off to bed, hopefully this caffeine wears off soon, I need some z's.  G'nite and love to all.
