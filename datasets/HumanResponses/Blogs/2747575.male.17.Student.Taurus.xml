      I watched a whole 2 movies today. The first was  urlLink Eurotrip , which was okay, in a sense. It wasn't that funny, but I really, really liked the music from it, which completed me to get the soundtrack (download, of course). Here are two songs that I particularity liked, and if you don't like them, well, too bad. I found all the songs on the soundtrack to be quite good, just like the  urlLink Elephunk  album by  urlLink Black Eyed Peas .  Link:  urlLink Lustra - Scotty Doesn't Know  Link:  urlLink The Salads - Get Loose   The other movie that I watched,  urlLink Taking Lives , was not that bad. It was quite interesting in some parts. For anyone who wants to know,  urlLink Angelina Jolie  appears nude in the movie, which didn't really make the movie any more interesting. If you have the time and the will, you can always download it though, or use one of those  urlLink free Blockbuster rental coupons  to rent it when it comes out on DVD.  Doom III is almost out. It has been  urlLink reported  that some stores in the United States are already selling the copies, illegally. Best Buy is one of them. It will probably be leaked very soon. I, for one, can wait to play it because I don't think I will like it very much, but I am, as is the rest of the public, hyped up about. However, only the limit on multiplayer (4 players) restricts the game drastically.  We decided we will be going to  urlLink Playdium  some time an a week or so. If anyone wants to come, drop me a message. Will says he's got very cheap tickets, and I can provide the ride some time after my parents come back. He also suggested that we invite some ladies - Ontario's biggest shopping mall is located steps away from Playdium. I say that it's a foolproof plan.  Oh, and here's a poem that Henry sent me. Interesting indeed.   A peach is a peach,     A plum is a plum,      A kiss isn't a kiss,     Without some tongue.      So open up your mouth,     Close your eyes,      And give your tongue,      Some exercise!

      Well, my parents have successfully left me for a week, all along with nothing to do. Last night was fun; we watched  urlLink Kill Bill: Vol. 2  and  urlLink The Bourne Identity . I didn't even watch the first  urlLink Kill Bill , but ah well, it was fun nonetheless, thanks to Rob's  urlLink Sony 60" Grand WEGA TV . It allowed me to take my mind from other things.  Right now, the weather sucks, so there isn't much that I can do. I'll probably be watching movies all day while I wait for  urlLink Doom III  to leak out onto the web - shouldn't be more than a day from now. And then, I might call her up and see what she says - it's always more fun do go places with a bunch of friends, no? I would think and hope so.  I just watched  urlLink Eurotrip . It was an okay movie, but the soundtrack seems so much better, downloading it now. It has all the famous songs from different countries, it seems. And now, it's time for  urlLink Taking Lives , so take care all, and wish me luck for all my future endeavors, as I need it.

      Everything is over. Chaos is everywhere.    I have predicted my mark correctly, and ended up with an 87%. I don't even care about the mark. Vic is going to  urlLink Wonderland  today, as Will asked her when we were driving by, but we forgot to ask the time that she is going at, or if we could come. I would've went.    Time to move on and celebrate the boredom of summer.

      Well, my high school, English had just ended. I just have to pick up my report card tomorrow and there will be no more English for a whole year, or maybe even more. I feel more relieved and sad at the quick ending of the course - only 18 days of school. I think I did okay on the exam, and I assume I will get around 87% overall, but that is just my guess.     Today, I did nothing. We could not figure out where to go, so we decided to go to the local shopping mall, which wasn't quite local actually. After chilling inside for an hour, my friend's car wouldn't start and we had to wait for about an hour while help came. Turns out that when the workers were replacing the manual transmission a day before, they didn't tighten some wire, which got loose and did not allow the car to start. We were actually almost about to leave the car at the parking lot.     Another highlight of the day was when me and my friend Dave (who's car wasn't starting just minutes before) blocked in another person. It was a 60 km/h road, and we decided we'd block this person because she honked at Dave before, so we took up the 2 lanes and went at around 30 km/h. That was fun while it lasted.     Tomorrow is the last day I will see Victoria. Although this does sound lame, as I don't even really know her, I will miss her. Nothing will probably happen tomorrow as I am too shy to do anything. It will definitely haunt me down in the future. Well, if I really wanted to, I could always call her, but that would be both weird and wrong, for obvious reasons. As I said before, I should smell the fresh air more often.

      Well, our last day successfully ended today. Tomorrow is out exam, and then after, we're gonna go do something, however, I am still not sure where we are going and with who. We cannot seem to decide where we would want to go, and I personally am too shy to ask "them" to go out with us. Doubt they will even want to go anywhere. Ah well, it was fun when it lasted, although I will not give up hope yet.     In other unrelated news, my parents are leaving for a whole week starting this Saturday morning, so I will have nothing to do. I won't have a car either, so someone will have to pick me up and we'll go somewhere, or so I hope. Or I can bike somewhere, that will surely be fun.     And now, it is time to study for the English exam. I don't really feel like studying, so I will probably do around 15 minutes of review, and consider myself ready for the exam. Although summer school was quite easy, I am very tired from school in general, and feel very lazy at the moment.     Ps. I heard they might be going to  urlLink Caribana .

      Well, nothing new today, as usual. My English mark is constant at 89%, which, in my opinion, is exceptional for this subject. Uh, we didn't do much today in class and I was very bored. I felt like sleeping, but my group would kill me. Right now, I have so much homework that I don't even want to think about it. I should get started now. Here's a picture of a guy enjoying himself in class.     I just went to Wal-Mart to pick up some things for my presentation (candy in fact), and since it was raining, I almost spun out. I was making a turn not that quick, wanted to test the abilities of the car, and I really felt like it was loosing control. ABS might of kicked in, and the car slid a bit. It was a fun experience, but always remember: don't do it when there are other cars present.  Tomorrow is the last day. I feel happy and sad. School is over for a whole month, which is a good thing. However, I will probably not see Victoria again after tomorrow (well, maybe for short periods of time on Thursday and Friday). I am extremely mad at myself for that. It is time to get out more often and smell the roses. Will did grab a picture of her today, so, if he sends it to me (and I get his permission), I might show it to whoever reads this blog. She is really sexy.

      Well, it looks like I just finished my individual project - my big CPT. The whole project is 58 pages, with 17 of those pages being completely typed from scratch by me, which is 8436 words of typing. I feel very honoured right now, especially knowing that I have a Unit Test on  urlLink Joan of Arc  tomorrow, and that my homework night tomorrow will probably be much more packed due to the group presentation, which is due on Wednesday.     Anyway, away from all the homework stuff: it is becoming too depressing for me to handle. Nothing really happened today. Will and me are still trying to figure out what to do on Thursday after the exam, and what might be a good way to approach the whole situation of them coming with us, somewhere. In fact, we have not even decided yet upon the place where teenage girls like to go, and where we, as a group, could go at 10 am. on Thursday. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd gladly hear of them. I am quite desperate here, as school ends in 2 complete days, and after that it is good bye to them, unless Will and me do something right now.     Lastly, my third point is completely off topic, but should prove to be a fun one.  urlLink Henry Chee , my good friend from Montreal (also known as p00kie), sent me a link to a game, which I found very interesting. It is a racing simulation game. Hope you enjoy it, as it is very addictive, and you can even save your progress.     Link:  urlLink Drag Racer v3

      Well, today went by smooth, except for the fact that I was not able to finish everything I estimated I could. I am still working on my homework, the individual part of the CPT (Culminating Performance Task), so I should be done by around 10 pm tonight. Then there is the group CPT which I still yet to properly start. I blame my laziness, and my lack of self control.     In other news, nothing new happened today, so really, there aren't really any other news. But I might as well just write something in here. Uhh, if this is news to anybody, school ends a whole 4 days from tomorrow, and then I will have a whole month of boredom. Obviously, that boredom could easily be turned into fun filled adventurous days, but I have yet to see how I could achieve that. One thing is for sure, since I do not have a summer job, I will be sleeping in and staying up much later than I did for the last 11 months.     Well, now, it looks like it is time to go back to work. I hate English as a subject, although the atmosphere this year is very pleasant.

      Well, today went by pretty well. I got a few things done, less than I hoped I would get done, but a sufficient amount. Obviously tomorrow will be a much more demanding day, since it will be Sunday. Still, I am very lazy. For example, instead of finishing up one of my summaries for a short story, I am typing this message up. Not that it really takes long to do my homework, it's just that I get easily distracted. I have two computers, one is a new one and one is old. I purposely do my typed homework on the old one because it sucks and I tend to stray away from my homework less on it, but it doesn't seem to stop me from posting a message in my wonderful *cough* blog.   And also, my thoughts about other things never disappear.

      Last night went well. We saw the movie  urlLink I, Robot , which was quite interesting. I almost fell asleep. I can sure tell you that the car in the movie,  urlLink Audi RSQ , was surely very awesome. That's about all I can say about the movie. I gotta get more damn sleep before I go that late, and the comfortable chairs make it all even worse.   On another note, I have, as mentioned before, lots of homework. "Lots" is just the beginning of it, actually. This is my last homework weekend of summer school, and around 10% of my mark lie on it, as well as an additional 20% of my mark, which is the exam, which I'll be writing next Thursday. This means that I will be very busy these last few days, but I will obviously find some time to slack off.   And on a third note...I am still available.

      And damn does it feel nice. I have a shit load of homework to do over this weekend, but at least I can just relax for the rest and the day (and night). Today was a fun day; we didn't do much and the hottness factor (of them) does not seem to be diminishing. One thing's for sure: they do like driving, and going out on Friday nights. I just gotta somehow tell them that I do do those things too. Next Thursday and Friday would be a nice time to do that, but who knows, I am not big on dialogues.

      Hmm, I probably should not be rambling on about this, oh well. Anyway, I really need to do something about this whole situation. I need to maybe get out more often, or something. I don't know. Someone help me, please.   Victoria is hot. She is nice. She is beautiful. She likes talking. She is everything anyone can dream of. The question is: how do I tell her that.   And the answer will probably never be discovered.

      As many of you might know, I am taking a summer school course. Nope, I didn't fail anything in day school - my marks are actually quite good. I wanted to take a course so that I do not have to take it next year. I am taking Grade 12 English by the way. There is an upside to my extended schooling: there are quite a few hot girls in the school, particularity in my class. Damn, if only...   Well, I should probably stay away from that route. On a second thought, no. I seriously have to do something, get a girlfriend or something. It's long overdue, and Victoria would make a nice one.   Anyway, here are some poems that I have to analyze. Oh well.     Welcome and Farewell    Johann Wolfgang von Goethe       My heart beat fast, a horse! away!  Quicker than thought I am astride,  Earth now lulled by end of day,  Night hovering on the mountainside.  A robe of mist around him flung,  The oak a towering giant stood,  A hundred eyes of jet had sprung  From darkness in the bushy wood.   Atop a hill of cloud the moon  Shed piteous glimmers through the mist,  Softly the wind took flight, and soon  With horrible wings around me hissed.  Night made a thousand ghouls respire,  Of what I felt, a thousandth part---  My mind, what a consuming fire!  What a glow was in my heart!   You I saw, your look replied,  Your sweet felicity, my own,  My heart was with you, at your side,  I breathed for you, for you alone.  A blush was there, as if your face  A rosy hue of Spring had caught,  For me---ye gods!---this tenderness!  I hoped, and I deserved it not.   Yet soon the morning sun was there,  My heart, ah, shrank as leave I took:  How rapturous your kisses were,  What anguish then was in your look!  I left, you stood with downcast eyes,  In tears you saw me riding off:  Yet, to be loved, what happiness!  What happiness, ye gods, to love!

      Last night, I experienced another tragic power outage. No, it didn't last the whole day, like the one last summer did, but it was quite an experience in itself. It happened right at around 12 a.m. I was putting the rechargable mouse in it's cradle, as I was about to go to sleep, and boom, the power cuts. It scared me for a second there, as the timing was just perfect. Then the power came back on for another instant and shut off. Deciding it wasn't worth to stay up and do nothing in the dark, while waiting for the power to come on, I went to bed.  The power came back on at around 12:35 a.m. I didn't bother turning on the computer (which also happens to be the server for this website) as I thought that the power might just shut off once again during the night. It stayed on the whole night after.  What is the moral of this story? Err, I don't exactly know, just that Hydro companies should have better reliability.

      Jesus, wow, this site deserves an update. Well, what can I say: nothing, really. Uh, it is Tuesday right now, and there are about 4 weeks of summer left for me, after which I have to go back to school. However, others have to go back in around 2 weeks, like my friend who lives in Montreal, so I should be happy, that is, if I like summer. Well, I do.  Well, we're finally doing something tomorrow - going to  urlLink Playdium . It better be a nice day tomorrow, or else I will kill something (notice it doesn't say "someone"). It's been quite boring sitting here at home and doing nothing, and tomorrow will be a chance to kick back, relax, and kick some ass at the arcades. Or not. I will also get to drive - for a very long time, and on the highway, something that I have not done in a while. It should prove to be fun, unless I get some sort of a ticket, or worse. Hopefully it won't be too crowded either, however, since it is a discount night, I feel like there will be lots of people present. Oh well, we'll have a whole 4 hours to kill. There is even a chance Victoria will come - something that would definitely make my day.  Yesterday, I also got these free  urlLink Toronto Blue Jays  tickets in the mail. I almost forgot I ordered them for free around a month ago. I have 2 tickets for this Saturday's game, each one of them worth $40, and I am not sure what I should do with them. Thoughts are floating around though.     Other than that, I hope you can wish for me to have a wonderful day tomorrow. Oh, and I promise (if that means anything) that I will try to update this site more often.

      Well, nothing happened today, as usual. Nothing will ever happen with me. I installed a DVD Burner for a friend, and that's about it. I didn't watch any movies today either. Instead, as pathetic as it sounds, I tried to organize my thoughts and emotions and call Victoria. Well, at around 9 p.m. I finally did just that. I said "Hi" to her mom and asked for Victoria. She picked up very quickly. I was just saying "Hi" to her, and the phone starts beeping. The conversation was cut. Just my luck, the cordless phone died on me. No, I did not hang up; the battery rang out. I was very disgusted - you cannot imaging how hard it was for me to dial the number, and now, it was almost like for nothing. Wait, no, actually it was not.  I did not call back, however, that does not mean that I will not call her again. I have, indeed, accomplished my goal for today. It did not go as far as it should have, but the cause is beyond my control. I will, and I promise this, call her again tomorrow and speak to her. I will just tell her how I feel about her, and nothing more. I will leave it up to her to interpret - she can do anything with my emotions towards her. The way I see it, the conversation will lift a whole lot of pressure from me. If she denies me sharply, I will be able to forget as I have done everything in my power. If she shows some sign of interest, it will be a bonus, and I will definitely take advantage of that bonus.  Sure, this sounds all lame, but I have to give it a shot. I really do love her that much.

      Well, summer has been steaming ahead at rapid speed, while I enjoy doing nothing in the comfort of my home. That didn't make sense much.  I watched a total of 4 movies at home today, by my myself. So, since nothing else happened in my life (I might be a bit under exaggerating), I will critique every one of those movies.  The first one that I watched was  urlLink Beyond Borders . It wasn't a bad movie, especially since one of my favorite actors is in it,  urlLink Clive Owen . The reason that I think he is so great is because of  urlLink BMW Films  that he stars in. If you haven't yet caught on, my dream car is a BMW. Anyway, back to the movie. If you want to feel bad about yourself and the world around you, then this is the movie to watch. Otherwise, it is complete garbage.     Next, I watched  urlLink Adaptation . Sad little movie, but it just did not hit me hard enough. I was so boring until around the last 20 minutes when something actually started happening. Basically, the movie is about a movie in which a person is writing a screenplay for a movie based on a book. Yea, something as messed up as that. Anyway, if you like to be bored and like  urlLink Nicolas Cage  acting as a freak, again, then this is the movie for you. By the way, he is 2 characters throughout the whole movie, being on stage twice all the time, which was probably quite hard to actually film.     The third movie that I saw was  urlLink Punch-Drunk Love . It was another one of those very boring movies about a mentally challenged (retarded) person, except in this movie, the guy got everything he wanted: he got love. Well,  urlLink Adam Sandler  did a brilliant job, but this movie was very boring as well. It was hard to see such an incapable characters get anywhere in life. This characters is so out of it, yet he manages to somehow get his life fixed and finds the right girl (well, actually, she finds him). Pathetic, although, I do appraise the movie, as its ratings are very good.     And the last movie that I watched:  urlLink The Perfect Score . Now, this movie really cheered me up. Yes, the plot is not the greatest, but the actors, in particular on of them by the name  urlLink Leonardo Nam  where great. Leonardo, who played Roy in the movie, was the "comic relief". He was so funny, it actually made the movie very much worth my time - much better than the other 3 that I watched today. I highly recommend that you watch it: you might not learn much, but at least you will be entertained. Here are some memorable moments from the movie.         That wraps up the movie review for today. Just one more thing that is worth mentioning: I still do like Victoria very much and I am even going to try to speak to her tomorrow, and we will see what happens. Call me crazy, and I know I am, but it is worth a shot. I hopefully won't be disappointed that much. Wish me luck.

      Well, I just watched this movie, and boy, is it weird. First, I'll start off with quoting the first thing you see on the screen once the movie starts.    It has been said that something as   small as a flutter of a butterfly's   wing can ultimately cause a typhoon   halfway around the world.

      I watched  urlLink Shrek 2  today. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but fun nonetheless. The music was also not bad, however, it wasn't as good as in  urlLink Shrek . It was very short as well. Other than that, I've been drinking  urlLink Dr. Pepper  and  urlLink Coca Cola  steadily throughout the day to stay alive. I'm sort of too lazy to make food; so much for my health.  The  urlLink CNE  opens its doors on August 20th. Yes, that is quite a long time away, but we should probably go. I am sure Victoria would be going there with her friends anyway, so it is another possible location to go. It should be quite fun too; I've gone a few times around 5 years ago, when I lived in Mississauga.  urlLink Ontario Place  might be another fun place to go to as well. I cannot wait.  In case you are still bored, like I am, you might want to check these videos out. Viewer discretion is advised.  Link:  urlLink Dork Vs. Glass  Link:  urlLink Dr. Pepper Is Not Safe
