       Today I watched ROnald Reagan's funeral.  It was like the most beuatiful thing i had ever seen or heard.  Of course not the people talking..but the choir, and the music was breath taking. I decided that i want the guy who sang Amazing Grace to sing at my funeral...remember that friends!!     I am having a lesson today with Darlene. (thats my horse trainer) Pegasus (my horse) got his feet done by like the best farrier it town yesterday...for like 150 bucks.  But its supossed to be worth it, because it improves their gates when you ride. And they stay on better. Which "A OK" with me. I hate it when their shoes come loose. Any way....Rachel was supossed to come to met my horse ans see me ride but something came up. Its ok she can come next week. Barbara..who is one of my best friends, and role models in the horse business...is coming to watch me ride as well. But she comes like every week so its no big surprise.  My mom and her boyfriend Pete are coming as well. And so is my friend Becky. Im excited. Well i g2g. I LOVE YOU GUYS!!

      Hello,    My name is Julia, im almost 16.  I live in Tennessee with my parents.  My dad just bought a really cool digital camera...so i thought hey ill build a little website where i can post my pictures for my friends to see.  And write little journal things.  It is summer now...we have been out for about 3 weeks, but it seems like longer to me because all i have done is work...go and rid my horse...and sit on ass at home doing nothing.  I have spent some time with my two best friends rachel and becky. But Rachel has to go to summer school for 6 weeks so i dont get to see her for the morning part of the day...(which is a ok for me since i love to sleep in) ne way that is me in a nutshell...actually there is much more to be said about myself..but if i tried to write about it, it would very hard to follow. BYe
