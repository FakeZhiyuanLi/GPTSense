      Sometimes quickies really are the best.&nbsp; This goes for a lot of things in life. I don't have much time to post tonight so I'll get to the bottom of how I'm feeling today. Betrayed, yup that about sums it up. I'm so fucking pissed about mitch staying at kate's house.&nbsp; The bitch hasn't called me ONCE this week. Which brings her three week total for phone calls placed to me up to all of TWO. And one of those was returning a voicemail message I left to her. I was talking with Clay the other day and he suggested I just whip her ass. Now normally, I'm not the type to resort to violence, and I can't see myself actually physically assaulting her. She is slightly handicapped. It wouldn't be a fair fight really. Unless she was geeked up and in that case I would be just asking to have my ass beat. I don't know what to do really. I know that acting like I dont' care would be the 'grown up' way to handle this. But I don't feel very adult-like right now. I'm pissed; I'm upset; I've been stabbed in the back. And the fact that I KNOW mitch is doing this just to get at me makes it ten times worse. If I ignore them, she wins...If I get pissed and let him see that HE wins and I'm not sure which is worse right now. I don't want mitch back, that's not what this is about. Yes there are some strands of green woven in this fabric of anger just a bit but for the love of GOD I was MARRIED to this man. He is the father of my child! I went through hell, and I"m STILL trying to claw my way out of this hell hole because of my feelings for him. I just don't get it. When is this nightmare going to end? I don't trust girls in the first place because of shit like this. I let my guard down, develop a friendship with this chic. A very unlikely friendship might I ad. And she basically, commited the ultimate friendship sin. More to come tomorrow.

      There's this Avril Lavigne song I'm completely obsessed with lately. It's off her new CD, number seven, Nobody's Home.  *I couldn't tell you Why she felt that way She felt it everyday I couldn't help her I just watch her make The same mistakes again What's wrong, what's wrong now Too many, too many problems Don't know where she belongs Where she belongs. She wants to go home but nobody's home That's where she lies broken inside No place to go, no place to go To dry her eyes broken inside. Open your eyes And look outside Find the reason why.&nbsp;&nbsp;You've been rejected, And now you can't find What you left behind Be strong, be strong now Too many too many problems Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs. She wants to go home but nobody's home That's where she lies broken inside No place to go, no place to go To dry her eyes broken inside. Her feeling she hides Her dream she can't find She's losing her mind She's fallen behind She can't find her place She's losing her faith She's fallen from grace She's all over the place* &nbsp; Well anyway, that pretty much says exactly what inside my head and in my heart the vast majority of the time. Maybe that's why I'm so in love with it. My sobriety is coming along pretty well. I've been slipping a little but not with Coke, just green, which I had been doing for years and it never posed a problem. I know deep down I should let go of this too but one at a time I guess.  That's about all I really feel like saying today.

      The past couple days have been pretty normal. Got through without too much stress. The DFCS worker decided to close the case finally. One of the boys I take care of fell out of his crib and broke his arm last week, and so of course, I was under investigation. The Sperm Donor didn't show up for his own son's birthday. Big shocker there. My ex-mother-in-law will be in town next week, maybe she'll have another intervention. I get these moments of clarity, when the fog in the black cloud I live in momentarily lifts and I can actually see things clearly. Yea that corny song does come to mind. It usually doesn't last long. Maybe the closer I get to recovery, the better I'll feel. I have always had this 'sixth' sense. I'm not sure if I believe in the whole clairvoyant thing but there is certainly some sort of deeper thinking going on sometimes. Or I guess it could be just gross hallucinations, that's always a possibility. Take for instance deja vou. It happens to me about once every other day or so, and it's something I've just gotten used to feeling. Seeing things because I've experimented one too many times with one too many drugs is not something anyone can get used to. I was driving to work the other morning and I pass this old appliance store. Well I guess you could call it a store , but really it's a hundred year old cotton gin that someone turned into an antiques store and then into a used appliance store/repair shop. The yard is littered with old ovens, fridges that are missing doors and washers with no working parts. As I rounded the corner and the old tin gin came into view I saw a black man, slumped over an old stove/oven combo. It was that old dark brown color, the stove, probably from the 1960's. The black man was obviously dead. Except when I looked away and back again, no one was there. Nothing. Just an old abandoned oven. Probably used 40 or more years ago to cook thanksgiving turkeys and Christmas cookies, possibly a birthday cake or two. That dead black man was as real as real could be. I saw him. I know he was there. A couple days have past since this happened and now I have to think. Ok, he obviously wasn't real. Just a figment of my imagination. Alright then, why did I see him? I was telling someone this story and he asked me if I had seen Secret Window, that jonny depp movie. Well I haven't and I'm under the impression that, with my already fragile imagination, I probably shouldn't watch it either. Ah, well the sun is out and the humidity is low. I had better take advantage of this rare occasion and take the kids to the park.

      If ever there were a person to lead a true double life, conservative by day, radical liberal by night, it would be me. Full time (and then some) I'm a nanny. Not only do I raise my own son, I take care of 2 other boys and a handicap woman. I thought the boys how to walk, talk, feed themselves, and 2 of the 3 know how to swim (enough to save their lives if an accident happened anyway). I've help suzzie (the handicap lady) go from wheelchair bound stroke victim, to a woman who can half-way manage her own life. All this in the name of good karma. Because when night falls, my alter ego decides to show up. The manic depressive, self loathing, drug consuming monster comes out. And in all fairness to the good me, I've been rather successful in keeping the monster at bay during the vast majority of weeknights. Come Friday my chains, and all the restraints I've placed on myself all week can no longer contain that evil demon that lives in my soul. The pain of being alone, seeing the hard life I have in front of me, all becomes too much and I need to be numb. My white horse gallops in to rescue me, taking away my pain, my suffering, any grasp I managed to grab hold of that week, and my weeks hard earned wages. This seems self defeating, no? Yes, the rational day-light hours me thinks so too. So with the help of HIM waltzing back into my life and destroying what little friendship bonds I had made since his departure from our marriage, my parents finally saying "enoughs enough", I took on long swallow and locked that bitch asses demon deep down inside of me somewhere. It didn't go away. It's not like you can just up and decide that part of you doesn't exist. She's still in there, somewhere, dying for the moment she can get her sweet release. It's like a constant black throbbing. Opposite my heartbeat is the heartbeat of Her, my demon. I get the playdooh out for the kids. We were having a grand time, laughing, squishing, mashing, throwing bits of brightly colored freedom around. It was fun. Then I caught a good long whiff of the playdooh and it reminded me of my cherished powder. It was like someone tickled the hibernating bears nose. Insane! I know! Here I am playing with three beautifully innocent little boys, who know practically nothing of how cruel life can be. (rest assured all three will one day know part of the pain, 2 of them have a mother that can't walk, talk, or control bowel movements. The other has an, ironically enough, drug addicted father who is so strung out he can't remember is own name half the time)Anyway, like I was saying...Here I sit playing with these innocent boys, them soaking up the 'good' life. And me? I've had to walk outside to smoke a cigarette because all I can think about is that sweet burning sensation going up, up, up my nose and numbing everything. My nostrils, the back of my throat, the roof of my mouth, my teeth, gums, my demon. I could call D-man. He would deliver. God I can't believe I'm saying this to myself. There are CHILDREN here. Sweet, innocent children who don't deserve to have a eff'd up mother/nanny. The nicotine hits me and for a moment, I'm okay. I shake it off. Go inside, drink a diet coke and start cleaning up the playdooh. Put on Blue's Clues, feed the kiddies, and then it's nap time. Time for a swim. I'm like a robot until I jump in the clean, cool water. The smell of chlorine has a way of calming me. I'll swim for a while and then go take a shower and lie down for a quick power nap before I hear the kids. Errands to run, shopping to do. Tomorrow is my little boy's second birthday.

      So I guess this is where I can come clean about all the trash in my life and no one has to hear it but they can if they want. (why anyone would subject themselves to it is beyond me) So where to start. Today is my exhusband's birthday. The arrangement was, he was going to get eff'd up all weekend and stay sober today so that he could spend today with his son. This, to make up for not spending time with him on father's day. Well, suprise suprise, I haven't heard from him. Why I bother with it is another one of those things that escapes all the realms of logical thinking. So point being, I was suposed to go to Six Flags with a guy friend of mine. (yes one that i've slept with but only once and not recently) Needless to say, I'm not at six flags. Intentionally or not, He always has a way of ruining even the smallest amounts of fun and excitement I manage to muster. I had come so far in the past 10 or so months since the final split. I had gotten past most of the anger and resentment, the pain was still there but I had found a way to make that go away too (it may have been illegal but it sure as hell worked). I had made all new friends, not a single one left over from my previous life. Late one friday night HE called me. Not totally abnormal for HIM to call out of the clear blue wanting to hang out and pretend like nothing bad had ever happened to us. Somehow, sometimes we both secretly need to pretend like our lives never fell apart, somewhere deep down parts of us still need to feel like the other is, was, and always will be there. Anyway, HE calls and wants to come hang out with me and Kate (my 'best' friend). It's all good at first. Chillin', getting wasted, remembering the fun times. A couple days passes and the good "i missed you" feeling is gone and the "now i know why i divorced this punk ass" feeling returns. So I go back to my seemingly normal role as failure daughter, struggling mother. Only, HE doesn't go back to his life. HE stays in mine. As in, he moved in with Kate. Although both deny the obvious, I'm not a moron. I did live with him for seven years, I do know his game. Hang out, get her eff'd up, get her hooked on me and the drug, and then wammo....'love'. I was the only one in his past that the game wasn't run on. I was the only one that didn't fall in love with the hard assed druggie. I was the only one who knew who he really was. It's one of my great accomplishments, seeing the real HIM, and also my curse. Now all I have left from that life is a little boy that is the spitting image of HIM, a 'bestfriend' who denies being in love with my exhusband, and a whole slew of folks that think I'm absolutly insane, and a habit that I've only recently come to terms with and tried to fight. So here I am, forcing myself back into the protective confines of my self made prison. My parent's home is probably the leat productive place a person can be. You just sit here, with judgmental eyes beating down on you. They walk past me and I just feel the disappointment, the shame. They don't see that I'm trying to turn it all around. It's true what they say. One day at a time. sometimes, One moment at a time. Started therapy, and of COURSE, the main thing that good ole Doc James tells me is 'keep a journal'. (I wish i got paid 6 digits to tell folks to keep a journal)hence the idea for my internet journal. Why not let a bunch of perfect strangers read my random thoughts? My day to day struggle with sobriety and single motherhood? Maybe if enough perfect strangers tell me I'm messed up it will help give me the motivation to change. We'll see.
