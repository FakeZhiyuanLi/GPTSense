      Think I'll try black font today.&nbsp; Well the last day or two has had alot of ups and downs.&nbsp; We did the spanish day thing and saw Spider Man 2.&nbsp; It was pretty good but some parts seemed funny when they probably shouldn't have.&nbsp; I now owe two people money and have none so I need to get some.&nbsp; OOH, somewhat funny story for you: Erica and Brittany pulled up in my driveway as I was talking to my Mom shirtless and shoeless on the deck...I got ready quickly and found that I had no money (well, like a 2 dollar bill and a whole lot of change, which didn't do me much good.)&nbsp; So I asked mis madre for some and she reveals that she has no cash.&nbsp; So we take the unusual approach to it and she writes a check.&nbsp; Rushing out the door we (Erica, Brittany and I) went and picked up Kevin and we stopped by the bank.&nbsp; I thought for a second and said "I don't know what to do...someone come with me."&nbsp; So Kevin and I stood in front of the machine densely and said..."Hmm, well I guess we have to go in."&nbsp; Needless to say we were like the most conspicuous looking people in the bank that day and we stood around dumbfoundedly for a moment before Kevin said he'd just pay my way in.&nbsp; We then went and ate at subway and lots of confusion occured in the ordering process and Kevin ended up not having enough for my ticket and Brittany had to pay my way in.&nbsp; So, anyway, that's how I owe people money.&nbsp;   I'm sad today because my dog had to be "put to sleep" (killed) and that sucks.&nbsp; She was bought as a puppy for me&nbsp;from the pound when I was like 4 or 5 and she was the only red pup in a litter of black ones.&nbsp;   I quit air alert 3 last night...I just didn't feel like doing it and it was getting to push more towards torture than exercise.&nbsp; I'm not sure if&nbsp;that's a good thing or not because Brandon is still doing it.&nbsp; Speaking of Brandon: I believe I FINALLY&nbsp;decided on his position in the band...he's gonna learn guitar and be a rythm guitarist.&nbsp; With the motivation&nbsp;of&nbsp;being in a band and me telling him "Come on, you're holding us up you son of a pig!" he'll probably learn relatively quickly.&nbsp;   That's all I can think of&nbsp;right now so, have a good day.&nbsp;

       Hey!&nbsp; Time for more mindless ramblings of my personal, non-sexual, affairs.&nbsp; I couldn't think of a title&nbsp;but I&nbsp;saw my ferret&nbsp;run&nbsp;by and seeing how that's a totally random little creature&nbsp;he seemed worthy of being&nbsp;the title of my&nbsp;post.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I went to Gannon's yesterday and saw a bootlegged addition of Anchor Man (is that supposed to be two words?&nbsp; Oh well)&nbsp; It was really funny.&nbsp; We explored all his little barns and stuff&nbsp;that are for some reason scattered throughout his&nbsp;backyard.&nbsp; I got trapped in a little house and like 5 wasps buzzed around in my face when&nbsp;I tried to open a door...miraculously I wasn't stung but they blocked my window and&nbsp;door escape routs so I found another window and&nbsp;climbed right into a thorn bush to get out.&nbsp; He also burned Secret Window but&nbsp;either my&nbsp;@%$#&! up&nbsp;PS2 and DVD player or his @%$#&! up disc wouldn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;ANGER!!&nbsp; By the way, whoever you are, you should buy that movie cuz it's really good.     &nbsp;   Our&nbsp;(people from spanish)&nbsp; Spanish Day is tomorrow and that should be fun.&nbsp; Holy crap I just saw a transfer truck (well...a really big truck of some sort) back into a driveway across the street...that's gotta be hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Ze band name (if my opinion on best-thought-of-thus-far band names&nbsp;makes the final decision) is Gone Astray.&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose this cuz it sounds cool, it's catchy, and it could have alot of different meanings.&nbsp; I&nbsp;thought about it&nbsp;and Brandon&nbsp;may have a&nbsp;more minimal&nbsp;role in the&nbsp;band than I was thinking.&nbsp; Of course we'll&nbsp;probably have a long uncalled for arguement on the subject that will hurt relations but I&nbsp;believe it's for the best&nbsp;so that's the call.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Well that's about all for now so...see ya later.&nbsp;

       My cousin spent the night at my house (yes I kicked my brother and parents out) last night and my brother was driving us INSANE!&nbsp; (if you've ever been to my house you'll know what I mean.)&nbsp; So we became shirt ninjas (there's a rather simple technique where you turn a shirt inside out and kinda put it on and tie it just so, so that it looks like a ninja mask) and went outside and up the road just walking around.&nbsp; Not wanting to go back home we went up the road to a new housing developement called "Huntstone" and walked around up there.&nbsp; Now...I didn't think anyone lived there yet....I found that I was wrong.&nbsp; Walking past some houses I saw two different houses with a car in the driveway and one little dog&nbsp;wouldn't stop barking.&nbsp; We couldn't turn back now because we didn't know if it would take longer to go back or forward so we kept going and eventually made it to the main road.&nbsp; As we came over the crest of a hill I saw my dad pull out of the driveway and go up the road, when we got down the driveway we saw him go past the house and by the other way (strange).&nbsp; Brandon and I went to the backyard and were hanging out when my dad came up (didn't see us at first and went to the shop) and told us quite demandingly to "Get in here." Here being the shop.&nbsp; Once we were inside he asked where we went and we said up the road and he said "Well a lady from up at Huntstone called the police and said she saw two young men walking around up there and she was afraid they were gonna tear something up".&nbsp; Holy crap!&nbsp; But...then my dad told us that he was kidding and the police hadn't been called.    &nbsp;  I still haven't started reading...and I haven't written (book) in several days...DAGNABBIT!&nbsp; And I have English first semester so I'm screwed unless I get to readin'.    &nbsp;  Well if I haven't told you (which I probably didn't) I'm trying to start a band and my cousin may be in now.&nbsp; My brother rented a snowboarding game with a song called "Courage" by Alien Ant Farm&nbsp;and it's been stuck in my head ALL DAY.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  That is all.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Hey, as you can see I've created a blog because it's all the rage and it matches my hair.&nbsp; Actually I think it was Kevin's relative Josh who had one first, then Kevin copied him and Erica copied Kevin and I'm doing one because Erica suggested that I do so.&nbsp; I'll probably steal a digital camera (probably Gannon's) and get some crazy pictures up and maybe I'll post some creative literature that I make or something.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  Kevin went to Kansas this morning and I'm not entirely sure when he comes&nbsp;back but I need to go terrorize his mom, cat and house whilst he's not present.&nbsp; I (like the procrastinator&nbsp;I've proven to be) haven't started summer reading yet and I have two books to read.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was supposed to go by&nbsp;Kevin's and get "To Sir With Love" today and of course forgot to.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  Anyway...I don't really have anything to post of today so...comment&nbsp;on this&nbsp;holy creation of bloggism and&nbsp;go stomp on your neighbor's roof!&nbsp;

      Well, Gannon and I went to the jamboree yesterday.  We screwed around for awhile and I just walked in without buying a ticket.  A tornado touched down somewhere and it was raining so it got cancelled.  Gannon came back to my house and we did random stuff and talked about Jacob half the night.  The next day (today) we walked up the road to some little old house.  We walked through alot of tall weeds and grasses and stuff to the front porch only to find that the door was locked.  We went around back where the ceiling was caved in and went through that way.  I was caught off guard by a picture of a woman on a wall that someone had drawn on...freaked me out.  We went up stairs and looked through lots of pictures and papers and there was lots of writing on the walls but both the digital camera and camcorder died so...little help there.  Hurricane Charley (haha!) is coming today/tonight....I'M READY FOR HIM!  It'll probably end up as a little breeze but it's been raining on and off all day.  Well...that's about it.  Later.

      Hey, actually not much has happened since my last post but I have to keep the flow goin' in the bloggalicious lair.  Things have been dull outside of school...and in school for that matter.  I talk to all my people and go to classes and things go on as usual.  BUT!!!!  We found a bassist for "GONE ASTRAY"!  Some guy named Jake....ok, I don't know his last name, and I haven't talked to him yet...but he's been playing bass for five years and sounds good enough to be in.   Maybe I can do something this weekend to liven things up and make things more exciting for all the blog readers...since you have such scandalous fun reading of my fun.  I kinda suck...I have a poster thingy due in english on Friday and haven't started it...but it's a drawing thing, so that'll be pretty easy; I also haven't written anymore on my book!!  It nags at me everyday and I somehow come up with something else to do that is obviously superior in prioritative (that's a word now, if it wasn't a minute ago) rank in my little bubble of procrastination.   I have to go get ready for bed...after I write in my little computer journal thingy (yeah I keep a journal...cuz I'm a fag) OOOH!  Aren't you so hurt and afraid that I have secret files on my personal life that you can't lay eyes on!   That's all...go spray paint yourselves blue and streak down the hallways whilst pretending you're on hallucinogens.

       Well...week one of school is down.  Yippee!  only like...175 days left...then 360 more and i'm done forever, always assuming I don't drop out...that's not extremely likely though.  Feelin'  uninspired...think I'll start a fire.  I desperately need to write SOMETHING.  I don't know...song, poem, book, story, whatever.  I'll do that and THEN start that fire.     I got some tricking inspiration by watching Jujimufu in his latest video, and watching the aerial tutorial.  I still don't have the guts to try an aerial so I just did some cartwheels and seeing how I can't even do a one handed cartwheel I need practice.   If you didn't notice I really had and still have nothing to write about...I'm in a kinda weird mood today.  I think I'll go out in the woods or down some trails or something...maybe draw some...write somethin.  Later.

      I hate double posting on things...nothing big but if anyone didn't know I got a new computer like...umm, i dunno, a few months ago.  And we left our old one at ncol cuz it was screwed up.  Just now they figure out that they can fix it and it's gonna be fixed by next week, so I'm gonna have my own computer then...which is cool cuz doing all my randon non-porn-related things on the computer is annoying when my parents and brother are right behind me.  This means there is gonna be some massive rearrangement in my room cuz my room is little and kinda cluttered.  Umm...I  think  that's all.  Go be cool expressive unique people and go smell some flowers and pet some kitties and hug some old fellas.

      Well...back to school tomorrow...suckage.  But that's ok cuz i'm gonna...wait, no...i'm not gonna see my friends because I have no classes with them.  I have two classes with Matt and one with Emily but that's all that I know of.  I'm gonna take my anger out by being a jackass in school and maybe vandalizing something just for the hell of it...hehe i love insurrection.   I went shopping today and got like 3 pairs of pants and 2 shirts.  Now I have something to wear!  Goody!  OOH, this catchy kinda upbeat music with a hint of techno (and a dash of paprika, hh) was on in Goodys (where I was shopping) and I was being stupid and strutting in tune with the music and doing hand motions and head bobbing, half way to embarrass my Mom.  I came to an intersection where the little tile path splits and there was some big advertisement there and I went around it, and this kid was going all out like it was a disco floor with his arms flying and feet moving.  And it wasn't like a little kid...he was a probably 10 or 11 redneck looking kid and he just stopped really abruptly when he saw that I saw him and I just started laughing to myself cuz I was just acting stupid and that kid was doing so much more.  Oh, and I heard "Another Postcard" by Barenaked Ladies while I was there and that's funny because it's a kinda funny song you wouldn't expect to hear there.  I finally finished To Sir With Love and I guess it was ok but it wasn't my kinda thing.  I read cliffnotes (spelling?) for Siddhartha and that seemed much more like a book I would have liked to read all the way through.     I found another artist that whoever's reading this needs to check out: Shinedown.  I've only heard the song "45" but it's really good and it's been stuck in my head.  That's like the first good artist I've heard of on MTV...well it  was  the rock countdown though, so I guess there are more decent artists on that.  That's about all for now...later.
