        Yesterday, it was the usual Sunday thing...that we have to wake up @ 8am to catch the 9:30 mass then have lunch at my grandparent's house. It's been 2 months that I wasn't able to do this ritual that my family and my whole clan used of doing. My Grandma kept on calling me up then and asking why I haven't visited her and Grandpa...I made a lot of excuses and that I told her that I'll visit her next Sunday but never did...   The reason why I wasn't able to visit her is because my friends and I are almost always in Puerto Galera or if not, i'll just stay at home and sleep all day. But my main reason of not visiting her is that am tired of my grandma asking me about my ex (my 1st BF of 5 years), that until now (after a year and a half since we broke up), she's still hoping that we will end up together. Also, not only my grandma, but my whole relatives will indeed asked me about work, and when am going back abroad. Am tired, so tired of reapet questions and answers...   In the 24 years of my life, I have lived with their expectations. They have been looking up on me and that I've always been the role model of my younger cousins. My whole family and clan has always been proud of me...of all my achievements in life...that actually for me is no big deal.   Until last Sunday...finally, i went to my grandma's house...because my mom got pissed and she trew a pillow to me just for me to wake up and go with them...so i did...my grandma was so happy to see me again...we talked...shared stories...she was excited for the wedding she will attend on Tuesday...and as usual...she's teasing me when am going to marry and that she wants to see his apo sa tuhod...and i joked her that if she just wants an apo, i can give it to her anytime...hehe =p she told me that am pilya...we shared tons of laughters and all that...it was a great Sunday...and i was suprised, for the first time, she never mentioned about my ex! but she asked about my suuitors that my mom told her...so after 2pm, we all went home...kissed my grandma goodbye and hugged her...and left...well, i actually thought while i was hugging her that i indeed love her...   when i arrived home, i spent time with my dad...because my mom stayed at my grandma's house...so dinner time, my mom arrived but my dad left because he has a bowling tourney...so my mom and i shared stories together...   10pm...my mom received a call through her mobile...from her 2nd to the youngest sister...i just heard my mom shouting and saw her freaking out...so i calmed her down and asked why...she told me that my grandma was sent to the hospital because she can't breath...so i told her to calm down and that everything will be alright...but then...she did not...she immediately went to the hospital and asked me to call all my aunts and uncles to tell the news and call my dad as well...so i did...after 15 mins...my cousin Mic called me up and asked me where i am...so i told her that am home...she told me that she will pick me up and that we have to go to the hospital...so i just said okay...so when we were in the car, she's quiet...am not used to it...we are always wacky when we are together...when we arrived in the hospital...i saw my mom weeping...then after 2-3 mins, all of my relatives came...then...after 15-20 mins...i got the shocked of my lifetime...my grandma's gone...she's gone...I didn't know what to feel...what to say...what to react...i just shouted...i cried so much...i can't explain it...but it hurts...SO BAD ='( until now...i haven't accepted the fact...i felt it was just a bad dream that i'll be awake soon...   am here in the office now...to turn over my work...i'll be on leave till thursday...later...i'll be going to my grandma's wake...damn! i can't stop crying...the pain is too much for me to bear...i just can't imagine myself going to a wake and that it's my grandma who's inside the coffin...somebody please help me...it hurts...SO BAD! i just love my grandma so much...but wasn't able to show it to her the past few months...i hate this! i just totally hate the feeling!!!   My dearest grandma...wherever you are right now...i want you to know...I love you...and that if you can come back...please do...because I NEED YOU! More than you know...please grandma...please come back...I LOVE YOU ='(   --April 26, 2004--

          Good question ...and yet...can't figure it out myself...all I know is that I enjoy the feeling of dating...getting to know a person...and analyzing if I could actually spend time with him...but come to think of it...i have dated a lot of guys already...but then, after a date or two, i can alreadily tell them that it won't work...why?  Because conversation for me is REALLY IMPORTANT.  If i can't actually have a wonderful conversation with a person, it's just a waste of time. What's the puspose of us being together if we can't really talk right? I mean, haller!!! We can't just say hi and hello then just look at each other the whole time...I need somebody who could speak their mind, who could share his insights...his thoughts...it doesn't have to be like we should have the same thoughts about everything...i love debates...healthy arguments i may say...i love learning from other people... them letting me realize something that I haven't thought about all my life ...i just love that feeling...and that would make me really crave for more conversation with that person...   oh well...to be honest...am kinda tired of dating and ended wasting my time...but, i will still not give up...i know...somewhere...somehow...in time...i would definetly find that   ONE DATE   I have been searching for...A date that i have been longing for...a date that I'll never notice time coz we are having a wonderful conversation...and will always end with something worth while...IN TIME =)   --May 24, 2004--

       This is one of my most favorite songs...just wanna share it though =)   She'll let you in her house  If you come knockin' late at night  She'll let you in her mouth  If the words you say are right  If you pay the price  She'll let you deep inside  But there's a secret garden she hides   She'll let you in her car  To go drivin' round  She'll let you into the parts of herself  That'll bring you down  She'll let you in her heart  If you've got a hammer and a vise  But into her secret garden, don't think twice   You've gone a million miles  How far'd you get?  To that place where you can't remember  And you can't forget   She'll lead you down a path  There'll be tenderness in the air  She'll let you come just far enough  So you know she's really there  She'll look at you and smile  And her eyes will say  She's got a secret garden  Where everything you want  Where everything you need  Will always stay  A million miles away   http://candysroom.freeservers.com/bruceweb5.html   --June 19, 2004--

      I was very excited to come to the office today...because I have a couple of deals to close and that I will be able to meet my quota =) My energy was indeed high...i don't know...but i was just happy...to see my friends...to do my work...and to chat with my best guy friend jay...oh well, i'll be honest, i can't think really what's the reason why am happy...the bottomline is,  I WAS HAPPY....   Until, my friend, whom i was dating for almost a month now sent a message to me through YM...we chat...shared stories...then, i was teasing him about him adding my close friend wows while me, I was the one who added him in friendster...i was just joking...but he replied "babawi ako"...I got curious so I asked HOW? He replied and told me that he would let me read his blog...i was  shocked  and  excited  at the same time...because he told me before that he woudn't want to share his blog...not yet...not now...which i understand because it's indeed too intimate to share...coz i myself can't just easily share my blog...so...just today, he gave me the permission to actually browse and read his blog...though i was really busy, i made sure that i'll be able to at least visit it...so, when i was kind of free, i immediately went to the site...i was smiling while i was looking at it...then, suddenly i just realized that am actually reading each story that he has posted there...i didn't recognize the time and the deadline that i have to finish...i was  DUMBFOUNDED ...suddenly...tears fell into my eyes... it hit me!  People closest to me knows that am not the type who would just cry out of nothing...so, it just means something...but have to figure it out though...perhaps, i never knew how emotional or sentimental he can be...and that I was able to comprehend the  REAL HIM ...I  am able to appreciate what he is right now...   Oh well...it really looks like i was kind of affected with what he wrote...and what i have discovered about him...and that, I indeed thank him for  TRUSTING ME ...i indeed value it...SO MUCH! I just hope and pray now that this would be a start for us to really understand each other  MORE DEEPLY.  =)   --June 14, 2004--

         &nbsp;   My good friend Len and I decided to see each other since we became too busy with work and haven't seen each other for months now.&nbsp; Since Rei texted me that he will be celebrating his 25th bday at his place and asked me to invite some of our&nbsp;friends, I&nbsp;told&nbsp;Len about it and we'll just meet up there.&nbsp; So in short, we all met up at Rei's bday celeb.

        Today, my best friend in college and I had our lunch together.&nbsp; It's been long since we did this and we have decided to&nbsp;really make time together when&nbsp;we&nbsp;exchanged messages in Friendster and also with her blog.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really felt that I miss her, so bad.&nbsp; We were a tandem them, like one cannot live without the other, something like that, and&nbsp;we did crazy stuff&nbsp;then that our&nbsp;barkada cannot really forget.&nbsp; But because of our bloody work and working scheds, we had a hard time seeing each other.&nbsp; Oh well, so while we were having our lunch, we shared stories with what's happening in our lives right now.&nbsp;   I felt&nbsp;I was a new me   because&nbsp;I gave her advices that I've never dared to tell when we were in&nbsp;college.&nbsp; Because then, whenever my barkada had a problem, I always&nbsp;gave them sound advices, plus a verse in the Bible.&nbsp;&nbsp;There's nothing wrong about that I know,  but too much of something is&nbsp;not healthy as well. &nbsp; Everything has to be balance right?&nbsp;&nbsp;She even called me then&nbsp;  a&nbsp;"pastora" - a woman version for a pastor.&nbsp; I never knew I was that extreme then but the bottomline is that now, am balancing everything in my life, and I know, she's happy to see the new me ;-)

        Everyday, before I go to the office, my dad and I have lunch together...yesterday, while we were having our lunch I shared to him my weird dream last Monday and I told him that I was scared with what would be the meaning of my dream.&nbsp; My dad told me that it's just but a dream that I need not to interpret.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I&nbsp;told him that dreams are sometimes a warning to what would happen in our lives.&nbsp; Then my dad explained, that people always want to complicate things that though it doesn't matter at all, still we tend to overanalyzed and make our lives complicated.&nbsp; Then he told me:-  Dad: Anak, that's your problem sometimes,   you tend to overanalyzed and complicate things in your life and that you are missing the joy of your journey.   &nbsp; I was quiet when he told me that.  Dad: Sa, since you were a kid I've always admire you.&nbsp; Though I wasn't a good father to you then, but everytime my kumpadres and I talked about our children, I've always been proud of you...You are smart, intelligent, independent and you always know what you want in life and you always get it...that's why I was scared of you then because you never let me feel that you needed me...I know that we have been experiencing a lot of problems since you came from abroad but I am so happy to see you again, to be with you and spend the rest of my life with you...but my dear child, I want you to enjoy your life...I haven't seen&nbsp;your sweetest smile, I haven't heard your most loud laughs...and it bothers me...tell me anak, what's&nbsp;been bothering you and&nbsp;even your dreams scares you.  Saz: Dad, sorry if am taking life so seriously and that I sometimes forget to enjoy the journey...am just worried with lots of things...like my work, my life...and you...I love you dad...so much...and   I&nbsp;feel the pain that you are experiencing now.  &nbsp;   My Dad interrupted.  Dad: Sa, I know how much you love&nbsp;me and I can't thank God enough for having you in my life...perhaps I have died early if you weren't here in my life.&nbsp; But anak, you are still young, I want you to enjoy your life.&nbsp; I want you to fulfill all your dreams...  Saz: And you are part of my dreams dad  Dad: I know anak, but you taking good care of me and helping me prolong my life is more than enough.&nbsp; It doesn't mean am badly sick, you woudn't enjoy life anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know anak, it would help me best if I would see you happy all the time and reaching all your dreams and goals in life.&nbsp; Please anak, bring back your old self.&nbsp; Go and enjoy your life.&nbsp;   You are young and don't waste that.  &nbsp;   My dad smiled and gave me a hug.&nbsp; Then he joked me.  Dad: Kaya ka di mag ka boyfriend, madalas sinusungitan mo mga manliligaw mo. Tsk tsk, mamaya kay Jim ka pa ma-uwi talaga. Hahahaha.  I looked at him and gave him an angry smile.  Dad: Anak, joke lang...tawa ka naman kse.&nbsp; Always smile at everything, may it be a problem, a challenge, a disaster but most of all to love.&nbsp; You know anak, you need somebody with you already...I know you have experienced a lot&nbsp;all this time&nbsp;but that made you a better person and you have learned from it.&nbsp; And from that experiences, you have known yourself, you have loved yourself, you know what you want and what you need already...  you are a complete person now...and therefore, you are ready to really love.  &nbsp;  You just have to meet&nbsp;the RIGHT ONE for you.  &nbsp; Saz: But dad, how would you know if he's the right one for you.  Dad:&nbsp;Well,   you shoudn't be really compatible, but you complement each other  .&nbsp; Meaning, the other shares to the other what the other doesn't have and then makes the both of them better.&nbsp; That's what you called  BALANCING. &nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore you make a very harmonous music together.&nbsp; That's true anak.&nbsp; If that&nbsp;someone makes you a better person or gives you direction in your life and you do the same to him, then you have found a&nbsp;right partner.&nbsp;&nbsp;It just means you&nbsp;really love each other because you&nbsp;allow the other&nbsp;to grow independently, to be really successful and vice versa...that's called selfless love.&nbsp; And when&nbsp;it's there, you woudn't be able to deny the feeling.&nbsp;Basta pray ka lang.&nbsp; God will guide you ;-)  Saz: Thanks dad.&nbsp; I needed that. =)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I just had a talk with my boss and I finally told her about the real situation of my life...I was relieved after that talk and I had 2 things that I would do starting next week: -    &nbsp;  1. spend more time with my dad   2. fix myself    &nbsp;  I'll be taking a leave&nbsp;come Monday, and it may take a week or two...but all&nbsp;I want to do is just be with my dad...spend more time with him...do things we&nbsp;never did before...we'll just be carefree and happy...and at the same time, I would be able to relax myself...unwind...and have a great time with my dad...we'll clear our minds from all the worries and stress and just enjoy life together...and I believe&nbsp;this would help us have a clearer view to where we are heading to and to&nbsp; slowly embrace reality...

        I have been reading Chicken Soup for the Couple's Soul again...I have stopped reading it few years back.    Anyways, I have highlighted something&nbsp;in there that&nbsp;I would like to share.&nbsp; Here it is: -      Love is the most powerful, magical force in the universe, and there is nowhere it displays its beauty and wonder more than in the intimate relationship between two people.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Some loves between two people endure a lifetime.&nbsp; others are destined to only last for a while; then the two lovers are separated, either by choice or by fate.&nbsp; But one thing is true; no matter what the outcome of a relationship, when love enters our lives, it never leaves without transforming us at the very depth.&nbsp;

        Last Friday, I wasn't able to sleep well until last night...because somebody has slapped me had me faced reality...  &nbsp;  Since I was a kid, I have never loved my dad...he's the monster of my dreams...he always wanted me to be perfect and to be somebody that I am not...I always have to meet his standards of perfection and if am not able to meet it, I am but a loser...a failure…he manipulated my life...and there’s nothing I can do but to meet his expectations and do whatever he said...but no matter what I do to be as perfect as he wanted me to be, I was never good to him...that's why, I hated him...so much...  &nbsp;  So right after graduation, my mom has given me the privilege to travel...so I went to Bangkok and spent a week there...then when I came back, my ex has told me to visit his parents in Dubai...so with much excitement, I told my mom I wanted to go there...though she hesitated when I initially told her that, because she was questioning me what's with that country that interests me...so I told her, I've always wanted to go desert safari...so she permitted me...so I went there...and after a week, decided to try applying for a work…I was surprised that a lot of companies would like to hire me...I was overwhelmed...without consulting my mom about it, I have signed a contract with a very prestigious company as an Executive Assistant to the General Manager of the world's only seven star hotel...I felt great...I knew my worth...and I told myself that this would be a slapped to my dad's face that am indeed a great person that only he can't see...so I just called my mom and told her about it and she was shocked and begged me to come home...and I said that I have signed the contract already...though it hurts my mom, I was firm with my decision, I wanted to know my worth...I wanted to prove the world that am really good...especially, to my dad...so, no matter how hard it was for me, and that I did cry every night longing to be with my mom and sister...I kept all the pain inside me...just so my dad would know my importance as well...that's how much I hated him...I wanted revenge...then, after some months of staying and working there, I got the news of my lifetime...that my dad is sick...badly sick...I didn't know what to feel when I heard of that news...but I cried after I heard about it...I knew that even though I felt so much pain, I still love him...and that am still afraid of losing him...  &nbsp;  I knew that my dad cannot accept such fact that fast...it took at least a year before he actually accepted it...and also, that was the time that I have received a letter from him...he was asking me how I was and all that...I was crying when I was reading his letter...because that was the FIRST TIME he actually communicated to me...that was also the first time he told me, that he loves me and that he apologize for all the pain that he has caused me...I cried so hard...and asking myself why now? Why does he has to experience a sever sickness just for him to open himself to me and to express the love that I have been longing for since I was a kid...but I knew then it wasn't too late...I told myself that from then on, I would also do all my best to show him that I do love him too...  &nbsp;  I came back to the Philippines after 2 years...and when I saw my dad, it's really obvious that he's really sick...the tall, buff guy has turned into a dried leaf...but then, he was able to pick me up in the airport together with my mom and sister...I was surprised...such a wonderful effort from him...anyways, when I came back, we didn't really talk much yet...simple and small talks only...but it means a lot to me as we haven't really done that...until last year, we became really close...as I have finally convinced him, that above all things, above all men...above all the pain...I still love him...dearly  &nbsp;  We became closer each day…he has told me all the feelings that he has kept all this time...I felt so wonderful and I can't thank God enough that finally, my prayers were answered...though I knew that he's badly sick, I told myself that I will indeed DO EVERYTHING to PROLONG his life...I will sacrifice even my life just for him to live longer...as I needed him more now...as I have now felt the love of a father...and I wanted to show him the best of everything...  &nbsp;  Until last Friday...the doctor has told me to prepare myself for the worst...that my dad could only live for months...when I heard of that, I felt like am so gonna die...tears just fell into my eyes...I kept quiet...and just left...walk around...I didn't know what to feel, what to say...but it hurts me so bad...I knew that later he would bid goodbye to us...but not that soon...not yet...not now...I wanted to spend more time with him...I wanted him to enjoy his life to the fullest...I wanted him to be really proud of me...I wanted him to be really happy...to fulfill if not all, most of his dreams...but I needed more time to do all these...oh God...until now, I can't stop crying every time I think about this...I know I have to prepare myself for the worst, but please…my good Lord...not yet...give us more time together...  &nbsp;  So to my few good friends who can read my blog...I need your help in prayers...kindly please pray for my dad…kindly beg God to prolong his life…please help me...I need him still...please ='(  &nbsp;  *It would be greatly appreciated&nbsp;

            Last night, was fun...I had a great time with my friends...Vhal, Noel, Ryan, Gitz and I had our bonding again after a month.&nbsp; We did crazy stuff and laugh as if the're no tomorrow...hehe =P well, to be honest, I miss that...so bad...I have been stressed out these past few months and and getting crazier about work, family and love...i'll discuss one by one...  &nbsp;    work -   my current company now is okay...it's not that financially rewarding but the people are good...they have been there for me, supported me and all...but you know, it's not all that...i need a career...am good at sales which am doing right now...but this is not the job i want to keep for long...i wanted to be in the field of marketing...or to be an executive assistant to the president or managing director...that is the job that am longing for...so now, am actively seeking for such...hopefully, landed on what i really want...but am very much thankful for the company am at right now...for the people around me...for taking good care of me...for loving me...and for believing in me...so much! No matter how discontented i am.  &nbsp;    family -   well...i do love my family...my mom, my dad and my little sister...no matter what would be our struggles in our family right now, i would still choose this family if ever i'll be given a chance to live my life again...though it's making me crazy sometimes especially if am torn between my dad and mom...sometimes, it's just to hard for me to bridge the gap that they have...hoping the love that i have for them would be the key to rekindle their relationship...well...am still not giving up...i know, in God's time, they would feel the love that they had&nbsp;then...and i also want to thank them for making me what i am today...a strong, independent woman...who has been surviving and fighting the game of life...if not with them, i woudn't be what i am today...No matter how tough it is to be in our family.  &nbsp;    love -   the craziest of them all...  when it hits you...it hits you...and you are too powerless avoiding it  ...you see, i've always avoided love..whenever i date, i always put a high wall between me and my date...because i just wanted to enjoy the feeling that these guys are falling for me...ego tripping i may say...my only goal then is to just date and enjoy...no feelings involve AT ALL...then suddenly, in&nbsp;an unexpected day...a guy&nbsp;i never knew and i&nbsp;wasn't even physically attracted to, got&nbsp;my attention by having a wonderful conversation about soceity and religion...after that conversation, he asked for a date and without any hesitations, i alreadily said yes...so when we were on our date, our converstaion never stopped, as if every stories that we tell each other interest&nbsp;us...we went out by 10:30pm and went home at 4:30am...we never noticed time...and from then on, until now...we almost always go out together...out of town, gimicks, coffee, movie, etc.&nbsp; and it's funny...before, almost everyday i have different guys to date...but this past 2 months, i only dated one guy...i only dated him...i declined&nbsp;every guy who&nbsp;asked for a date...i don't know why...but i have this feeling that i'd rather date him than other guys...i have told him&nbsp;personal things about my life which i don't do to any dates...i do things to him that i don't normally do...and i feel&nbsp;something that i haven't felt for long...though we talk, we txt, we chat, we see each other...i still always miss him...i still always look forward to be with him...hayyy...the feeling that i have been avoiding all this time finally hits me...i was in denial when my friends asked me if am in love...but it doesn't take a genius for my friends to actually know...they have seen me how i handled my dates before and how firm i was of not involving any feelings...they can see the BIG difference...and that was a big slap on my face that hey, be true to your feelings...to yourself...that you just don't like him...that you actually love him now...UGH! I finally admit it...oh well, i need not fear...as what my Aunt told me: -&nbsp;  &nbsp;  "For&nbsp;no matter what we say, what we have or do..  if you don't know how to love and invest in love.. you are totally bankrupt without love.   In ending, i would rather admonish you not to be afraid to love again.&nbsp;   We don't "fall" in love.&nbsp; Rather..love lift us up to become the kind of person God wants us to be.  &nbsp; I know you know that my niece,   and refusing to be in love again is a loser's and a pessimists' choice in life.   You're not one of them.&nbsp;   Live happy and at peace with God and you'll be surprised to find true love come knocking at the doors of your heart once again. Keep smilin' at love. Don't let one failed relationship shut you off to shine and discover a brighter future with another prince charming...   i bet you know that! You're a&nbsp;smart and gutsy girl.. don't refuse love! And&nbsp;when it's there.. grab it&nbsp;ala Michael Jordan! =) "  &nbsp;  After reading her email...i felt i should not be scared at all...i'll just love...and it's up to the person if he'll love me back or not...but the bottomline is i'll give and share love... i can't force him to love me back...but i can&nbsp;be a person that can be loved... so no fears now...i will just love,   life my life to the fullest...make something worth while...as life is short... i should never be afraid to share love, share my self ...  so when am gone, i have touched people's lives...and when i face God, i can tell him that I have loved...trully loved =)

        Yesterday was my dad's operation. Woke up at 4am and we left at 5:30...the operation started at 7am and was done by 9am...that was the longest 2 hours of my life...i didn't know what to feel...i was nervous then, but i was a little calm by the thought that God would help my dad and that there were a lot of people who prayed for him...before the doctor took my dad to the O.R., I called my dad and went to him, hugged him...kissed him...and told him that I do love him...so much...then after that, I turned to the doctor and told him to please take good care of my dad...and the doctor just told me to pray...so while I was waiting for him, some friends have been calling and texting me...which made me felt better...i needed somebody to talk to then...and i know that was too early for my friends to actually be awake but they were...and I appreciate it so much...I needed that...and of course, the presence of him (F), the man i have been talking about in this blogger...since the day before my dad's operation, he always made me feel that he's there...and he was...gave me all the encouragement that i needed...yesterday, he kept on texting me...asking about my situation and my dad's as well...I appreciate it so, so much...knowing how busy man he is...that's indeed one great gift he can give me, and that is...his time...his concern...his sincerity to help...i felt good...we even had lunch together...though we only spent an hour and a half, but that was a great lunch...it's like I have felt home...I felt secured...I felt that am in good hands...I felt better =) after that, I went to ortigas to see my friends...I just needed some time off...had coffee with them and all that...and when am about to go home, it rained...so hard...and that i wasn't able to find a cab...so while I was waiting for that bloody rain to stop, I sent a txt message to F, asking about his meetings and all that...he replied and told me that he has 2 meetings with their Indian Vendors and asked me if I want to listen...so I told him I'd love to as I needed a good laugh...so after a few seconds I received a call from him and heard him speaking with the Indian vendor...he told me to just listen...and I did...I was really laughing so hard...it gave me a tummy ache though...hahaha...so after he finished speaking with the Indian Vendor, we talked...and shared laughters...then he asked me where am at and told him that I was stranded because of the bloody rain...so he told me that if I won't be able to find a cab and he's done with his meetings, he will send me home...and I said okay...after 15 more minutes of waiting, and I was still there...standing...getting soak...I decided to drop by to our office instead while I was waiting for the rain to stop...so I did...after an hour, F has texted me and told me that he'll be on his way to pick me up...so I waited...then he came and went on our way home...when I was in his car, he gave me a donut that he got from starbuck's...so while we were in the car, he shared to me what had happened with his meetings and all that...then I also shared to him the e-mail of my dear Aunt to me...and I didn't notice that my Aunt mentioned to her letter that I had 2 exes after my 1st BF...so he asked...when we arrived in our house, we talked...I told him that I posted a comment on his blog about him finding another letter of the alphabet...so from that conversation, I told him about the "other" ex that I haven't mentioned to him for the reason that I felt it was unimportant to discuss anyways...so i told him...and I felt better after...because to those people whom I considered really important and special to my life, I always, always give them the BESTEST GIFT I could give...and that is trusting my life to them, my family, my past, my present and my future...which I just don't share to anybody...only FEW PEOPLE who're really close to me knows EVERYTHING about me...and this is my way of ENTRUSTING my life to them...with full faith and trust that no matter what I was, what I am, and what would I be, they would never judge me and would love me for what I am...that's how much I value it...so if am able to tell you all the details of my life without any hesitations, it only means that you are indeed special to me and that I consider you as one of the few closest people in my life...   F, thanks for everything...thanks for the time you have been giving me...thanks for the support and encouragement...Thank you for helping me carry some of my burdens...and thank you for helping me to trully trust again...THANK YOU! =)

        Tomorrow is my dad's operation...whew...okay, okay...i'll admit it...am a little nervous...not because i don't trust the doctor and makati med...it's just that i don't like the feeling of my dad or any of my family members getting admitted to the hospital and undergoing operations...uh! i totally hate the feeling...perhaps i got a lot of traumatic experiences in the hospital...well, since i was a kid i've always been the  "emergency room gurl"  meaning, i've always been hospitalized and almost always getting into the grave...that's why my family is always worried about my health, it's like when they hear me cough they would really freak out...that's how "fragile" i was...   Anyways, I just hope and pray that everything would turn out fine...i know it would...i just have to get rid of this bloody nervouseness...and perhaps that's why am this nervous because am doing this on my own...it would just be my dad and i...and i promised him not to tell anybody as what he asked me to...well, God will be there...I know...He's always been there for us...and I know this would be the start of getting my dad's health back...it would...though it would take time...but it would...In Shallah (Arabic term for "God Willing"). =)

        Hahaha...let me laugh first...hihi...yah...true...am getting crazier and insane each day...with work, with my friends, with my family and most of all with LOVE! Damn! I hate to admit it but it's true...somebody has swept my heart away...again...and am getting crazier coz i don't know if i'll be able to risk my heart again...i know love conquers any fear...but does it also conquers trauma? I don't know...i have been through a lot! as in a lot! you woudn't imagine...that's why, am having a hard time giving my heart away...but i can easily love any person...it's just that i need an assurance that he would take care if it...but i know that's impossible...crazy huh? perhaps, i just need more time to really heal...to really get over with the trauma...i even wanted a professional help...that's one of my goal though...just for me to be able to conquer all these...and that i could love again...trully love again =)   --July 8, 2004--

        I refuse to fall in love again. I understand the overwhelming reaction it provokes on anyone it touches, which only reminds me that situations of  intense hatred are not all that far removed from intense love.  They are strong, driving and powerful – which makes them dangerous.   Don’t get me wrong  I have nothing against love.  My cynicism has not been totally hacked away, but chipped chunks of it permit some glimmer of light to shine through.  Love is beautiful…love is sublime.   Love is the greatest inexplicable feeling of all.  All too true, but perhaps, meant only for other people. Not I. Not just yet anyway.   It isn’t that I’m obtuse, as much as I know that love can make people do things they wouldn’t normally do. Love has a way of taking you out of yourself and making you dedicate yourself to another, who may or may not respond in kind. Love is also a very disruptive experience.  All your life you walk alone then all of the sudden somebody comes along and shakes all that.  All this is what I find formidable - the power of the unknown. I have not been unloved, and I am not a total stranger to the feeling. I know how it feels to fall in love – the exultant euphoria of coming across a special stranger who touches something deep within you. Perhaps that is what I fear – to lose control to another human being like that, knowing all too well how fallible human beings are despite love; it is an unsettling prospect at best. Whenever I feel the pangs of stirring affection, the full of heady attraction, of the aching pain of missing someone of whom I am very fond of, it is not long before I stop myself and hold back, creating a safe distance, an impasse from which I can view this intruder with a cool, detached critical eye, not driven and blinded by wild, unreliable passion. I will myself to drift away – “I can live without this person” is what I often tell myself – in order to prevent the other from overwhelming me.  Because I know that when I fall – I fall hard. And, if I fall again – I’ll fall harder.  Which only make me hold back all the more. That is, keep everything to myself…silently.   Is it selfish to relinquish the  “I”  for an unassured  “WE” ? Perhaps, but when it has taken too long to find that “I”, one cannot entirely put to task for wanting to cherish the treasure of self longer than usual. At this point, I cannot gamble myself the self I sought for so long for the promise of a “YOU” and “I”; what guarantee is there that the other will not simply take my heart and stomp on it?  Love gives no guarantee ,  and trust that is needed to bridge this uncertainty is perhaps what gives love its luster.  But I have never been one easily given to trust, and therefore taking the leap into love is not an easy decision to make for me. Others plunge in with nary a second thought. They are not I.    Perhaps this primal insecurity only speaks of immaturity, and hence the inability to love, truly love.  For mature or being in-love is one that does not seek fulfillment in the other, nor dependence, but rather,  the mutual understanding and exchange of love connecting only to themselves.    Then, maybe then…when I am ready and bold enough to risk my heart again in asking the same promise which brought me to grief… IT COULD BE THE LAST.    --July 7, 2004--

        A friend of mine once asked me, what do you think is the sweetest thing that you have ever done to someone? Hmm...i wasn't able to answer instantly...but my friend told me that it will really take a couple of weeks, even months to even realized what was it. And yes, after like 6 months that i am able to answer that question.   The sweetest thing I have ever done to a someone is to give up everything, literally EVERYTHING - my family, my career, my friends, my own happiness...my whole life JUST FOR HIM. I have never imagined myself going to a foreign country without my family, my friends, my career, except HIM and yet...I DID! Without any hesitations i just went there with him...without even thinking what would be my life there, what's instore for me there, or what would my family will feel that i'll be away from them for years...i never thought of anything but just to be with him...this man that i have loved so dearly...that i have entrusted my whole life completely...I have never been like that with my life until he came...   Damn! I realized now how POWERFUL LOVE CAN BE...it can make you do things you never thought of doing...or just the thought of it scares you...but love conquers fear...grabe! ganon ko pala talaga sya minahal...I made everything possible...just because i loved him...   Though we didn't end up together, I am still thankful that he came into my life...because he made me conquer my fears...fear of not being with my family, fear of going to a place i have never been, and fear of entrusting my life completely with someone...   Jim, I know that you are very much happy and contented with your life right now...you have fulfilled our dreams then...but you have done it alone though...sorry if i wasnt there to help you, inspire you, support you and to love you...but at least, you did it! You are now in Canada, the place we always dream of settling down, you have a wonderful job as an IT Manager, and of course you have now your family of your own...am so happy for you Jim...and am greatful...because i know, on those 5 years that we were together, i did help you to boost your confidence...am glad you are a better person now...so now that we are living our own lives, and that we both are better person now...I just want to thank you...because you have also helped me become what i am today...Thank you...and someday, somehow, we will meet again...and I will still not stop thanking you for stepping into my life =)   --July 3, 2004--

        We all have our own stories of our love experiences, may it be painful or very joyous. But the common thing about us when we actually fall in love is that we do things that we never imagine doing when we are not in love. Funny but true.   Here are the things I never thought of doing but am actually doing it now: -       - Remembering every details of that person (like the way he smiles, he reacts, the way he walks, his perfume, his clothes, etc.)   - Looking forward to see him and getting excited just the thought of seeing him.   - Longing to hug and kiss him.   - Would always want to spend time with him alone.   - Listening and remembering all his stories and never get bored.   - Speaking to him over the phone, while chatting with him (multi-tasking) =P   - Having some unique words that only the two of us could understand   - Sharing my most intimate side with him.   - Sharing my past, my present, and my future...   - You can actually tell everything without any hesitations.   - Overcoming inhibitions   - Being really sweet and very much affectionate   - Giving up all my dates    And above all these, I  can still be THE REAL ME!  =)   I know, most of the above are the kilig parts of dating...but you know what I really love about US, is that, no matter how kilig and romatic we are...we are TRUE to each other...we have showed the REAL US...no pretentions...I just hope and pray that this would lead us to something really special that we could keep for the longest time. God permits! =)

        The problems you face will either defeat you or develop you - depending on how you respond to them. Unfortunately, most people fail to see how God wants to use problems for good in their lives. They react foolishly and resent their problems rather than pausing to consider what benefit they might bring. Here are five ways God wants to use the problems in your life:

        Last weekend, F and I went to Tagaytay for our weekend getaway.  It’s our usual bonding thing.  We had fun and enjoyed those 2 days together.  Then we had a topic about souls/ghosts and though I don’t normally tell people that I have this gift, I have honestly told F that I do see them (souls/ghosts) since I do trust him anyways.  So while we were discussing about it, he plead to just continue our discussion on our way home.  When we went out of their house and got into the car he asked me “Ok Sa, so meron ba sa bahay namen?”  I just smiled and said YES.   When I was a kid, I was always disturb by the fact that I can see these souls and I didn’t know who should I tell about it and that am afraid that my friends might laugh at me.  Until when I was a teenager, I found it more disturbing as I can see them more often, so I told my mom about it.  Surprisingly my mom has that gift too and that she told me that I need not be afraid and that I should just pray for them because they are just asking for my help in prayers.  So from then on, that’s what I’ve been doing.  Though these past few years, I was really trying to avoid it and I have never told anybody about it.  I just don’t want any further discussions about it, until last weekend…  When we reached Manila, F told me that we will drop by at Loft to meet up with Dougs, and so we did.  While we were there, we had the same topic.  Then they have introduced me to Dougs’ brother-in-law who has the same gift.  He even tested me and asked me if there’s a soul at his bar and I said yes.  He asked if it’s a guy and replied yes.  His last question was what he’s wearing.  I concentrated and closed my eyes and I told him that he’s wearing a white shirt.  And he agreed.  So we shared our experiences and it was all the same.  Sunday came and F invited me to their house as he will be giving lecture about direct marketing that he has attended last week.   So, I was there together with his friends and listened to his lecture.  After the lecture, we had dinner and we went swimming.  And surprisingly, we had the same topic J I had fun sharing stories with F and his friends, though I felt a little awkward because this is the first time I have ultimately shared about my gift.  Thought I felt good as well as they have made me feel that it was a wonderful gift and that I should be proud of it.   This morning, I woke up with a smile.  I felt like am no different with other people it’s just that I have this certain gift that others don’t or just hasn’t been developed yet.  Thank God, am still normal! LOL =P

       Yesterday was an "OK" day though my work sucks, I still enjoyed it just so because I started my day right.    I've read in the book (In The Meantime) that it's healthy to tell yourself "I Love You". I thought about it and realized that I have never told myself that...and so I did and it felt good after. So had a wonderful shower, a nice lunch with my dad...a good game of billiards and a lovely dinner.    So everything was okay, though I received a lot of text messages and IM messages from men that have always been there, expressing their feelings for me. G texted me that he misses me so much and that he wanted to see me. I didn't reply. Then P, texted me and told me he misses me and that he loves me. I didn't reply. L texted me too and asking if he can pick me up after work...I didn't reply. R sent me messages through MSN asking how was I and that he hasn't seen me for long and hope we can meet for coffee...I didn't reply. M sent a message to me through YM asking how am I doing and how was my dad and he will visit me next week and we'll have dinner. I didn't reply. Then my colleague asked me if I can date her husband's colleague who saw me in the pictures that we took here in the office and that he wanted to get to know me better. I just smiled and didn't confirm anything.    I really don't know if am ready to date again. There's this something that holds me back. Perhaps I have to rest my heart for the meantime, because now, I really don't know if I will be able to risk my heart again, to spend time with someone again, to be intimate with someone again, and most of all, to trust again.     It's funny how I attract men so easily, and most of the time win their hearts...but I just can't seem to have the same feelings for them. These men who likes/loves me for who I am and for who I was and that they are willing to wait for me to love them back, though I have never promised anything to them. See how ironic life is? There are men who are willing to do everything to have you and yet you can't love them back and there's a guy you really like and that you are willing to risk everything but seems you can't have him. Now here's a question.  Which is harder? To learn to love somebody who loves you or to wait for that somebody that you love?      Oh well...I have to continue my journey...though am in a bumpy road right now, I'll get through this. And yes, my friends are right. I shoudn't dwell too much with the pain...As they have been telling me, I have lured and luring a lot of guys wherever I go, I just have to be really, really picky and to be EXTRA CAREFUL on who to really like and who to really trust. Because I know what I can give...and that is a TRUE and LOYAL LOVE and that I need to get the man who really and trully deserves it.

        Today, my best guy friend Jay who's working in SG now texted me and told me he was waiting for my call (because I promised him that I will call him). So, I called him up. I told him about what had happend with our friend Ryan and with all the things that are happening here in our office. Then, we talked about what was happening in our lives. While we were on the phone, I just suddenly told him - "Jay...sobrang miss na talaga kita".

          I haven't slept for the past 34 hours and I just knew now what I really feel: -      1. I was sad to know that the person whom I like a lot and have learned to trust, doesn't really trust me. He said it was him...the problem was with him...and I understand it...but, was just hurt...For as far as I know, I have enrusted my life to him...I may haven't told him all the details of my life just so because we haven't really had the time to really talk about it, but at least the important things were told to him...I was very true to him...I never pretented...I have showed him the real me...trusting that whoever I was, whoever I am and whoever I would be, he likes me as a whole...I mean, I've been through a lot too...from supposedly getting married, to cheating...to believing...to friendship that I have kept for 12 years was gone in a snap. It's all about TRUST...but then, after all that I've been through, I have learned to TRUST again...and that is...him.         Now, I've relaized that it's easier to love than to trust...with love, you just feel it...but with trust...you have to earn it  ...so perhaps, that's one thing I should do, to really make this person feel that I do deserve his trust...because I know I do! But anyways, I just hope everything will be better with him soon...and that, In Time...he would be able to learn to COMPLETELY TRUST ME.      2. I was hurt to know that my parents were arguing early in the morning...and it was really petty...well, it's no big deal because it's but normal with any relationships...but was just affected...perhaps because of what had happened in number 1.      3. When I was about to go to work...I was just forcing myself...am really not happy anymore...and it's driving me nuts...but I can't just go...am still waiting for the job that I really want.       Well, after knowing these 3 points that I have felt for the past 34 hours, I believe that the virtue that God is teaching me now is -  PATIENCE . I have to wait for the time that F will learn to trust again. I have to wait for my parents to completely understand each other. I have to wait for the right job for me. I know, God has wonderful plans for me, it's just a matter of waiting for  HIS OWN TIME.  Not my time...but  HIS OWN SWEET TIME .         **Lord, as I am waiting...please grant me the patience I needed to survive so I may be able to receive the gift that awaits me at the end of this journey. I will encounter tough times along the way...so kindly help me be stronger and help me endure all the pain that I'll be going through. Amen.
