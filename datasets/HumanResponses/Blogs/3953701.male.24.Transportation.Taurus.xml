      I just finished putting together my new Computer! It rocks, the Computicon, as I call it is simply the most advanced piece of gaming hardware I have ever laid eyes on. It glowes a subtle UV blue and handles like a dream. The p4 3gig is way fast, and with teh gig of RAM behind it Battlefield Vietnam runs flawlessly. This definitly cements my move to the fraggin world of gaming.. welpers talk to you all soon...

      I should make this clear...   I DO NOT OWN A PS2 OR X-BOX   I am a pc gamer.. a comment I got from a friend made me realize that most gamers are on consoles... I on the other hand am not. I am a PC gamer first and foremost. I do however have the recommended equipment (mouse, keyboard, headset) for ps2. The USB equip for the ps2 is great. ok.. have a nice day, back to fragging.

      Well holy crap, my first post. Thought you'd never see me with a blog did ya. Ok.. well I am waiting for my gf to get out of class and I haven't played DOD or CS in a couple of days. (Feeling withdrawal...) I think I am going to go get Battlefield Vietnam today. I was watching a review of in on X-Play and I really want it now. Also I am waiting until World of Warcraft is out.. then there will be no end to my gaming pleasure.   On the subject of buying new stuff I am getting a new computer. It will be a p4 3.0 HT with a gig of ram. God, I can't wait.. it will fly like greased owl crap. I am also getting the Artec guardian case in blue which you can see  urlLink here . I hope to add an Ultra UV kit to it and watch it glow. Also I am adding a 600w Ultra power supply with 2 80mm blue LED fans.   OK, well... I gotta run to the bank and go get battlefield... write soon.

      I know its been a while, but I am back. The new comp is running great, but needs more cooling. I have found some products from Zalman that I am gonna use. My scores have gotten significantly better, now I'm up in the 20's constantly. I am going to try to join a clan... I like DbD and a few others. All in all it has just been way too busy at work and home to play too much, and with the advent of getting Star Wars: Galaxies I have had little time for my fps habit. Well I gotta get back to the fragging fields, write more later.

      This is a blog for my personal life. I am a 23 year old white male. I live on the east coast of the United States, and drive a school bus. These are all the things that build my "wireframe model", hopefully through this blog I can start to add some textures to that model. Well, let's see where this goes.
