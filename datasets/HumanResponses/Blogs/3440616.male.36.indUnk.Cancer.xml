      Well, I didn't feel so well this morning.  My CPAP mask has been particularly hard to endure lately.  Hopefully soon I'll summon the muster to get the insurance company to get me a new mask.  Emilie broke her glasses last night.  Kim and Em went to the eyeglass place where they originally bought them, and they "warranted" them for $15.  Not a bad deal, but they won't be ready until next Tuesday.  I decided Emilie shouldn't have to wait that long for glasses and so we went to Pearle Vision, arriving about 2:00 PM.  We found them online by checking to see what our insurance company (CIGNA) prefers.  The eye doctor saw us immediately with the only delay being the time required to fill out the "new patient" paperwork.  Emilie received the standard battery of tests, ending with eyedrop solution to dilate her pupils.  The doctor suggested we look at frames for the 10 minutes required to fully dilate the eyes.  We did, and found the staff there wonderfully helpful and patient with Emilie.  She picked out some glasses and then we went back to the eye doctor.  She examined Emilie in a dark room and everything checked out okay.  We paid the optometrist and headed out for a late lunch.  Much to our surprise, one of the Pearle people chased us down in the parking lot.  They had already made Emilie's glasses and we wouldn't have to come back.  Couldn't have been more than 15 minutes from when she picked them out.  Now that's service!  Emilie is very happy with them, and we left the store at 3:00 PM.  When the $15 pair come in from the other place, they'll simply be used as a backup pair.  After lunch (Burger King), I lounged on the Sofa while Emilie and Kim cleaned upstairs.  This was no ordinary clutter pickup, but a complete cleaning and purging of old clothes, toys, books, etc.  I appreciate the ambition but I have no desire to participate.  It's mostly their stuff anyway.  We're off to my office soon, where I'll load in the June 1 price update for Tadano parts.  Then we'll stop for a quick dinner, come home and pack, and head out to the farm.  Connie's birthday is being celebrated Sunday afternoon.  Emilie hopes Sierra will be there because she hasn't been able to see or play with her in a long time.  I just hope everybody gets along.  :)  ...til next time...  -Trevor

      Today is almost the last day of 4th grade for Emilie, and the school is sending home all the accumulated assignments, journals, artwork etc., as is normal for this time of year.  I find that I am particularly impressed with Emilie's poetry.  She has such a creative flare and a way of stringing words together that not only makes sense but rhymes well.  They also sent home her accumulated Journal which is very interesting reading.  It's sort of like a blog in print.  Truth be told, though, her writing was much better in the beginning of the year (when she clearly thought journal writing was cool) than it is at the end of the year.  All the writing is good, of course (we are talking about Emilie here), but she seems to have lost interest in making the journal entries interesting.  Must be the anticipation of summer.  'stros won 5-0 (Oswalt is da man).  Not much else to discuss.  So that's it for today.

      So I was just chatting with my sister via instant messenger when it hit me.  I really like my sister.  I don't mean in that "she's your sister, son, you have to like her" kind of way.  I mean if I ran into her on the street I would want to know her and be friends kind of way.  How cool is that?  Who would've thunk it after seeing us fight as kids?  She's a terrific person with a terrific husband and a terrific son.  Check out her blog at http://collinsmom.blogspot.com.  My family is having a minor crisis.  My father, bless his heart, has been watching FOX News and the bastards have turned him into a war loving Republican.  Yes, this has gotten extreme.  The fact that he tries to be respectful of Democrats and Liberals (such as myself) is more a facet of his personality than his true opinion.  He raised me to be a Democrat and now he's turned on me.  To an outsider, this is not a big deal.  To me, however, this is a crisis.    What was the turning point?  When did he give up on civil liberties?  Could it happen to me?  His reasoning and justifications are based on History - a subject he is qualified to opine about.  But at the core, he makes it seem like knowledge will naturally lead one to his side of the argument.  If you disagree with him it is a simple matter of education.  After he informs you of the facts, you can understand why he is right.  But, I am of the same opinion on my side.  How could anyone with intelligence and education be a Republican unless they are the type of person that is selfish and only concerned about singular issues and their immediate affect on the pocketbook?  Anyway, if Connie (his sister) finds out what he's up to things could get really ugly.  So, I had a birthday recently.  I don't remember how old I am now, but I think it's still "mid-thirties" and not yet "late-thirties." One of my gifts was a scanner with attachments for slides and negatives.  What a cool toy.  I've about filled up my hard drive just "testing" it.  Now, I need a project so I can do some masterful work.  I don't do creative stuff - that's for Kim and Emilie.  But, I can restore and retouch photos like nobody's business.  Maybe I'll put together an Uncle Ernie powerpoint slide show if I can talk my parents out of his slides.  A last random thought.  I had an idea today for making a charity portal.  I remember on september 11th, I just ran to Amazon.com and gave to the red cross.  Quick, easy, and painless.  Why don't I ever do that for other things?  Certainly I could spare $10 here and there for various causes.  In truth, I don't know anything about any of the charities or even how to get more information.  Sure, I can find red cross and united way on the web, but what about all the little tiny charities that I never heard of?  How do I know if they should get a small contribution from me?  I'd like to go to a place on the web where I could put in my zip code and see all the charities divided into national, regional, and local and then by type (cancer research, child care, etc.).  Then I could just click contribute to whichever one I wanted to and the portal would process it like Amazon did for Red Cross.  I could also research them and find out details like size, administrative overhead, and on and on.  Maybe I could even set up an automatic payment plan.  Does this exist?  How hard would it be to setup?  Could it be a business model or would it be better as a free service?  I suspect it's just another idea that I'll forget about tomorrow.  Good night world.  Thanks for listening.

      Today was Kim's first day at Region IV school and we had a horrible thunderstorm.  Poor Emilie had to stay outside under a pavilion at the YMCA all morning.  They do a great job of keeping the kids busy over there, even in bad weather.  I'm glad Emilie is there.  Kim seemed to enjoy her first day at school.  She reports being the eldest student in the class, and most uninhibited.  She already used up 1 of her 2 allowable tardies, however.  Shame shame.  Work has become more interesting recently primarily because of our new President, Mr. Sawada.  He expects more from us with communication and information sharing.  I've enjoyed rethinking all of my processes for him.  I've also enjoyed tweaking GAINS, building parts stock for new models, and kicking off a warranty database development project.  I'm reading a Dan Brown book now, Angels and Demons.  It is very good so far.  I'll write a review when I'm finished.

      Well, we saw Harry Potter last night at the old Loewe's theater.  The theater itself was awful, but we knew that going in.  The movie, however, was spectacular.  The best Potter film yet.  The new Dumbledore was great.  My 10 year old daugter, Emilie, was on the edge of her seat through the whole movie, sometimes clinging desperately to my arm.  This movie was definately a winner.  Today's focus is Kim's résumé.  We're really having trouble deciding on a format and also how much content to include.  The job fair is tomorrow, so we really have to step it up.  If Kim isn't happy with her résumé, it will be really hard for her to present herself to potential employers.

      John Kerry understands that America’s “my way or the highway” stance doesn’t play well around the world.&nbsp; We can get away with it as long as our military is the best in the world, but it makes everybody hate us. &nbsp;I don’t do my friends that way and I don’t want my country to do its’ allies that way.  John Kerry is committed to education and lifelong learning. &nbsp;He understands helping kids succeed in school keeps them out of jail when they become adults. &nbsp;He supports initiatives to help adults go back to school for retraining or broadening their knowledge.&nbsp; He supports expansion/improvement of Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” initiative.  John Kerry will reform the American health care system. &nbsp;It’s a mess right now, and stop gap measures won’t work. &nbsp;It needs an overhaul.&nbsp; John Kerry will fight for it.  John Kerry’s proposed Conservation Covenant with America is a bold step for the environment.&nbsp; He will also roll back the damage done to the clean air act under Bush/Cheney.  It’s the economy, stupid.&nbsp; Bush Sr. didn’t get it, and Bush Jr. doesn’t either. &nbsp;&nbsp;America survives on the backs of the middle class.&nbsp; Bush is making the rich richer and the poor poorer leaving too few middle class citizens to bear the burden.&nbsp; Fair doesn’t work.&nbsp; Get over it.&nbsp; Tax the rich.&nbsp; Problem solved.  The number one reason I’m voting for Kerry – he is not George Bush. &nbsp;I want that putrid soul out of office and I’d vote for anybody to do it. &nbsp;George Bush is no different than me or any of my neighbors. &nbsp;A great guy with a good sense of humor and a belief in the American dream. &nbsp;Sorry, but it takes a hell of lot more than that to run a country. &nbsp;So he didn’t get a blow job in the oval office. &nbsp;That’s the only qualification you need?&nbsp; Bush couldn’t run a business, he couldn’t run a state, and he can’t run the country.&nbsp; The sooner he’s gone the better.&nbsp; And yes, that’s a bitter pill I swallowed.   &nbsp;

      Well, Kathy with Kelsey-Seybold called today and says they did a "full metabolic workup and urinalysis" - whatever that is.&nbsp; Everything's great except my liver test is more elevated than April of last year, which was already high.&nbsp; So, they've scheduled me for an ultrasound of my liver on Aug 3rd.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Have a nice day!&nbsp; :)

      Okay, life’s been dragging on recently and there isn’t much to blog about. &nbsp;I can tell you that I went to the doctor yesterday for an exam&nbsp;to get my blood pressure medicine (Norvasc, 5mg) refilled. &nbsp;It’s been a year since I’ve been to the regular doc. &nbsp;Anyway, he says things look good but he wants to do bloodwork on me since I ‘forgot’ to come in last time after my enzymes were elevated. &nbsp;Fine.&nbsp; He also wants a urine sample to test my kidneys. &nbsp;Fine.   I go to the lab they have on-site. &nbsp;I love the gal they have there to stick you. &nbsp;She’s the same one who’s been there for the 4 years I’ve been going to this doc at Kelsey Seybold. &nbsp;She’s one of those people with a severe attitude.&nbsp; For example, I approach the lab room and wait patiently at the window. &nbsp;She is on the phone, so I just wait.&nbsp; Finally, she hangs up and says, “What the hell are you doing out there? &nbsp;Get in here, put your butt in that seat and don’t say a word.&nbsp; I’ve got enough trouble without someone else here to yack at me.” &nbsp;Fine.&nbsp; I sit in the seat she indicated.&nbsp; Another woman is already inside seated, looking a bit worried.&nbsp; This other woman says she feels uncomfortable about the process – I don’t remember her exact words, but she thought the nurse was a loon from the phone conversation.&nbsp; I told the woman this nurse had stuck me before and she was very good. &nbsp;Nurse says, “of course I stuck you before.&nbsp; I stick everybody. &nbsp;Didn’t I tell you not to talk?&nbsp; And you lady, uncross your legs.”&nbsp; She uncrossed them without reaction.   The nurse took my blood first.&nbsp; The other lady couldn’t watch.&nbsp; I told her not to worry, it wasn’t impolite. &nbsp;I wouldn’t watch her either.&nbsp; The nurse said, “I told you to be quiet, why is that so hard?” &nbsp;I shut up.&nbsp; When she finished, she handed me a plastic cup with my name on it and said simply, “Bye Bye.”   So I head to the bathroom.&nbsp; Next to the toilet is a little window. &nbsp;After you pee in the cup, you open the window and set it on a shelf inside. &nbsp;They can open the window from the other side and grab your sample. &nbsp;Nice system – you don’t have to carry a cup of pee around.   I tried like hell to pee in that cup.&nbsp; It just wasn’t going to happen. &nbsp;I finally gave up and went back to the nurse empty handed. &nbsp;She told me to get back in there and keep trying. &nbsp;I refused.&nbsp; She said go drink some water and come back before 5 (it was about 4 PM). &nbsp;Now, this is a lot of pressure for a guy like me. &nbsp;This drill sergeant nurse had me so afraid I didn’t think I could pee for a week. &nbsp;I suspected I wouldn’t come back after leaving.&nbsp; Then, I remembered the same thing happened last time and that’s why the doctor was scolding me for not finishing all my tests.   I went home, guzzled 3 large glasses of water and waited for Mother Nature’s signal. &nbsp;It wouldn’t come.&nbsp; Finally, Kim had to leave to go pick up Emilie from her friend Kelsey’s house and I decided we could leave together and stop at the doc’s office on the way.   I went in to the lab and politely waited at the window.&nbsp; I didn’t think the nurse noticed me at all, except she called out, “what’s your last name?” &nbsp;Nobody else in the waiting area answered, so I said “Clark.” &nbsp;A few seconds later she hands me a cup without saying anything and walks off. &nbsp;I went in the bathroom for the moment of truth.&nbsp; I still didn’t have to pee, but I knew 3 glasses of water should be enough to start some flow. &nbsp;I ran the water.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; I was worried about peeing on myself, and thought that might be a mental block, so I took my pants down.&nbsp; I washed my hands and went back.&nbsp; Finally, like a tidal wave, the urge came and the yellow river started flowing. &nbsp;Only it was flowing too strong.&nbsp; I filled up the cup but I wasn’t close to being finished. &nbsp;I couldn’t get my bladder to stop, so I re-aimed and nailed the toilet without trouble. &nbsp;Phew!   Anyway, so that’s where my story ends. &nbsp;It’s only blog-worthy because there isn’t anything else going on. &nbsp;Sorry you had to read it.&nbsp; :)

      So I'm at work, in a meeting with an associate who is droning on about something I can't even remember and my phone vibrates.  Curious, I check the caller ID and notice my sister is calling from Chicago.  I answer the phone, "Hello?"  No response, but I can hear what sounded like a merry-go-round in the background.  "Hello?  Is anybody there?"  No response, but I can tell somebody is fumbling with the phone.  My business associate gave me a strange look.  One more try, "Hello, are you there?"    A 2-year-old child's voice comes out loud and clear with, "Rode the train!"  Clearly, this was my nephew Collin and he was so excited.  In my mind I could picture his excitement.  "TRAIN!!!" he says again for emphasis.    I tried to talk.  "Collin?  Is that you?  Did you enjoy the train?"  My business associate is wondering about me because I'm using a baby talk voice.  The only response I got back was a giggle and more fumbling of the phone.  Then, the line went dead.    I wondered if Emi even knew he called.  I guessed that Collin hit the speed dial on accident.  I prefer to think that I was the first person he wanted to tell about the train, being as we're such buds and all.  :)    That's about it for interesting stuff today.    -Trevor

      So I read Bill Clinton's new book "My Life."  Actually, that's not true.  I listened to it on Audio CD, read by Billy himself.  The CD's were borrowed from a freind who bought them at wal-mart because they were half the price of the book.  Anyway, it was a good listen during commute time.    It is very self-serving, which I suppose is what an autobiography is supposed to be.  I have to say that I truly have a great deal of respect for Bill Clinton.  He thinks like me.  Well, maybe I think like him since he came first.    He does delve into the Monica Lewinsky scandal in some detail, but from a defensive posture.  I really feel sorry for him on that count.      The only other comment I have is that he rambles on a lot about stuff I don't much care about - especially the Arkansas years.  But it was only boring in parts.  :)    On the whole, I give it two thumbs up (if you can borrow it for free).    -Trevor

      Okay, so it's a little after Midnight on Wednesday and I feel like shit.  My nose is stopped up.  That alone is difficult enough, but it means that the damn CPAP can't force feed me air.  Basically, it means I have to choose between suffocation and sleeping without my breathing machine.  It's the dark side of OSA.  My eyes are so tired I can barely keep them open.  My body aches and wants to sleep.  But, I just can't fucking breathe.  The internet is so boring these days.  Everything is kind of a been-there-done-that.  So I'm stuck in this hell between states.  Can't sleep, can't wake up.  Fuck!  Watch out for the lizard men... they have ray guns!  -Trevor

      I'm certain Emilie would not like me broadcasting this to the world, but it's what's going on and this is my Journal, so here it is.  My 10½-year-old daughter has the first trickles of her period.  This is accompanied by a hormonal onslaught that has her crying and laughing within minutes of each other.  Oh I feel for this poor girl.  Of course, Kim has prepared her very well for this.  Kim was also an early bloomer, and expected it would happen to Emilie.  They've had numerous conversations about the birds and the bees, they've read at least 3 books together dealing with puberty, and Kim has engendered a sense of trust and normalcy about the process.  I'm so glad for that.  I never got any of that from my parents.  What I learned about it was mostly from my cousin Kerry, who went through it before me.  Even today, I have feelings of inadequacy and shame that I can attribute to this uncertain period of life.  Kim's birthday seemed to go well.  I got her a scale, a DVD (The Butterfly Effect), a mushy card, and an [unmentionable] that needs batteries.  She also did some shopping for herself and got clothes, a lunch box that's way cool, and some miscellaneous other stuff.  I made her a cake all by myself - chocolate with chocolate frosting.  My parents came out and we ate dinner at Johnny Carino's.  We didn't talk politics except briefly when they noticed I was listening to Bill Clinton's "My Life" on audio CD in the car.  Emilie expressed reservations about joining Grammy for vacation bible school next week because she was afraid of being homesick.  It made her cry in front of all of us, and I think that embarassed her.  She was very afraid of hurting Grammy's feelings.  Anyway, that's enough rambling.  Everybody's happy now, and getting ready for bed.  Good night!

      So, I'm just reading an article from Timberjay News about Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11.   urlLink http://www.timberjay.com/current.php?article=1086   Part of what it says is comments about how Moore creates a "conspiracy theory" in the movie.  Here's a quote:  "He quotes Congressman Jim McDermott, of Washington, at length, who believes the administration has used a message of fear, ratcheting up the terror alert level when politically desirable, to keep Americans distracted from issues the administration would rather not have explored."  So, then I google back to the main news, and I find "Ridge Warns of Election Terror Plot."  No specifics.  No details.  Just a general warning.  Why publicize that?  I'm beginning to get outraged at the current shrub administration.

      Okay, I just want to give a quick recap of my 4th of July festivities.  We (Kim, Emster, and I) decided that our best chance to see a big fireworks display without the hassle of a huge crowd was to see it in Katy at the Katy Mills Mall.  Normally, we do our own little fireworks show in the driveway, but (1) we're broke, and (2) Em's never seen a professional show.  So, with Emilie's friend Zoe in tow, we head on over to Katy Mills and arrive about 7:45 for the 9:30 show (we wanted good seat placement).  We heard they were shooting them off on the east side, so we parked as close as we could to the eastern edge.  Then, we hiked over to the mall looking to kill some time til the show starts.  We decide Jillians looks happenin (it's like Dave and Busters), and besides we're a little hungry so we make our way through the games to the restaurant.  After being seated in a nice booth, we decide it looks more fun outside, so we just get up and go.  Outside is a Hawaiian buffet, live music, radio station setup, etc.  We down our buffet nice and slowly - after all, we are killing time.  After finishing off plates of terriyaki chicken, sweet ham, tomato and cucumber salad, oranges, pineapples, watermelon, and sodas we sat back to relax a bit.    That's when the announcer started calling for "father and son" volunteers for a watermelon eating contest.  He made it clear that mom's and daughters were okay as well.  Of course, Emilie and Zoe were squealing with excitement and pulling us to compete.  Kim and I gave them the don't even think about it look to no avail.  As it turns out, they were having trouble filling slots, so they kept asking for volunteers.  He told the kids if they couldn't get their parents to come up, they should find a stranger willing to join them.  Emilie wanted to compete, but not bad enough to tap a stranger.  Zoe, however, had no trouble grabbing a member of the band and lining up.  I couldn't let a stranger be her teammate for goodness sake, now could I?  So, I tapped the band guy on the shoulder and asked, "you really want to do this or?"  He replied, "Nah, you go ahead.  You look like you could pack away lots of watermelon."  Uh, thanks, I think.  So now I'm on stage with Zoe and Emilie joins us to (1) be on stage and (2) play the role of cheerleader.  Our competition was 3 other teams.  Team 1 was an old lady and a young girl, maybe 5 or 6 years old.  Easy prey.  Team 2 was a father son combo that looked tough.  The boy was maybe 8 or 9, and Dad looked like he really wanted this.  They were the first to sign up.  Team 3 was two brothers - one about 10 and the other a teenager, maybe 15 or 16 (it's so hard to tell nowadays).  These boys were ready.  Team 4 is Zoe and me, the last and most reluctant participants.  Zoe and I put on our game face and said nothing to each other or the other contestants.  The game table was a standard 8 foot foldup, with and red and white plastic checkered table cloth.  Each team had a large platter on it with 2 longish quartered watermelon slices (not the seedless variety, it should be noted).  The rules were explained quickly by the announcer.  The team that eats the most watermelon in 1 minute wins.  No hands.  Ready go.  Just like that we started eating.  The no hands rule came in so fast and so close to the start we all had to let go of our watermelon before we could eat.  We dove face first into it.  The top part came off quickly, because you could open your mouth and bite something off.  As you started eating down, however, it became more difficult.  It's like trying to eat a big  sandwich that's so tall you can't get it in your mouth.  Since you can't use your hands, it's difficult to scrape a layer with your teeth.  But, Zoe and I had a zen moment and we used each other's slice to brace our own slice still while we scraped with our front teeth.  The strategy didn't seem to be working, however.  The announcer was calling out the terrific job team 1 was doing.  I was sure that was only because of the little girl, cause there was no way that old lady was scarfing watermelon.  But, I couln't take time to look.  Scrape, chew, swallow.  Announcer says team 2 is going at it seriously.  He says team 3 has a voracious appetite.  Then he comments on team 4 (us) with, "team 4 is well, eating."  Okay, the other teams get hyped up statements with emotion and drama and we get, ho-hum eating.  I'm thinking we've got to put it in high gear.  30 seconds left, the announcer says.  It's getting hard to breathe.  I'm suddenly conscience of the fact that I'm bent over with my ass facing the crowd.  Butt crack showing?  I decide stuffing my hand in the back of my pants to check would just make it worse, so I try to chew on.  The mother of all burps is loading up, the seeds aren't sliding down without chewing anymore and the whole experience is beginning to seem like a big stupid mistake.  I pause for a moment to catch my breath and swallow from a standing position to see if I can get the watermelon down.  I'm really ready for this to be over.  15 seconds left.  Zoe is going at it furiously.  I can't let me teammate down.  Emilie is cheering me loud and clear, "go daddy go!  you can do it!"  I started enjoying the competition again.  Zoe and I butted heads a few times trying to scrape that watermelon in.  Neither of us looked up or reacted to it at all.  Scrape, chew, swallow.  Scrape, chew, swallow.  The other teams are still getting glowing praise from the announcer.  He doesn't even mention us.  He's making it out to be a tight race between team 2 and team 3.  Scrape, chew, swallow.  Scrape, chew, swallow.  My mouth was starting to fill up with seeds that were stuck to my teeth.  I couldn't take the time to chew them properly or even steer them with my toungue.  As far as I knew, we were in last place and getting further behind.  I wanted to win.  I had to win.  I wanted to make Emilie proud.  I wanted Kim to give me that smile she gives me when she's happy with me.  I wanted the announcer to ask us our names and interview us for the radio station.  I wanted Zoe and Emilie to spend the prize of $50 in gaming credits in the arcade.  I just had to eat more watermelon and catch up to team 2 and team 3.  Then, it happened.  He called it.  Time was up.  I was very sad.  I just didn't have time to catch up to those guys.  If only I hadn't paused for air I might have done it.  I looked over at Zoe to compare and sure enough, I had only eaten about the same as her.  We locked eyes for a second and she looked very pleased.  Huh?  We then both let out a HUGE belch.  The kind you can't possibly control or contain, no matter what kind of manners you have.  The announcer started the judging from team 1.  The little girl was a mess, with watermelon all over herself.  The old lady had stopped eating during the contest to take pictures, and the announcer was poking fun at her.  At least she'll have fun memories.  I looked down at their watermelon and noticed they hadn't eaten much.  It was then that I noticed team 2 and team 3 for the first time.  Neither of them had eaten anywhere near as much as Zoe and I.  Heck, we ate more than team 2 and team 3 combined!  Still, the judge slowly talked his way over, with wonderful comments and praise for the father/son team and the 2 brothers.  He said he was going to have a hard time choosing between them.  I was confident by then - even cocky.  This was all an act on stage.  Any idiot could see at a glance we were going to win.  Just come annouce it would ya?  So, he finally gets around to team 4 (us).  "Oh my God!" he says in practiced astonishment.  "We have a clear winner."  I do a little hokey-pokey like dance, Emilie and Zoe scream, then Emilie hugs me and announces to the crowd, "I'm with them!"  It was a joyous moment.  I'm only sorry that Emilie didn't get to participate.  I know she would have won.  For our troubles, we got two $25 gift cards in the form of a business card with notes and a signature on the back.  The girls went to cash in while Kim and I conversed for a bit.  There was no big announcement, no inverview for the radio station, nothing like that.  But, Emilie was clearly proud, and Kim gave me that smile I love.  A stranger came to my table and congratulated me.  Then, I sent Kim in to find the girls and I waited for the check.  Then I waited some more all by myself for the check.  Then, new people came and sat at the table around us and I sat alone, waiting for the damn check.  All the other contestants were gone as was the announcer and the watermelon staff.  I still had to wait on the check.  A manager came by and asked if everything was okay.  Yes, except I'm still waiting for the check.  "Great!" he says with a smile then continues to other tables to check on things.  I guess he assumed the check would be coming shortly.  I wondered if Kim and the girls would come back out and sit with me, since I had obviously not joined them in quite some time.  But, no, I still waited alone.  I remembered the butt crack possibility again, so I reached back to check on it and along comes my waiter with the bill.  While my hand was in my pants.  Lovely.  So then I grab the women-folk, and we head out to the car in preparation for the fireworks show.  I notice that everybody is facing different directions in their lawn chairs, and we don't know which way we should face.  We decided on East about the time the lights went off in the parking lot.  Emilie and Zoe crawled up on top of the car and then the first blast went off.  They were mesmerized.  As I sat watching the fireworks I felt very fortunate.  Fortunate to have such a wonderful wife, a terrific daughter, a good job, and very few troubles.  I felt for the soldiers celebrating in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I wondered what life must have been like for the early Americans as they started up a new country.  Was it anything like what Iraq was going through now?  Emilie and Zoe were leaning against each other, looking up at the sky as it exploded overhead.  It reminded me of times when Kim and I laid outside and just looked up at the stars.  Moments like these stick in your memory for a long time.  Happy memories.  Happy thoughts.  The show was great.  We were only 75 yards from the fireworks base.  We could see the guys setting them off. It was special.  After it was over, we returned to Jillian's to use up the game cards.  We were there for another 2+ hours before calling it quits. We returned home and went to bed just before midnight.  I wish I could go to bed every night feeling that content.  Happy Independance Day.

      Let me just start by saying that I LOVED this movie.  If that angers you, stop reading and go find a war-lovers blog to read.  This movie was more about entertaining the anti-war, anti-bush crowd than it was about documenting facts.  My emotions ran all over the place.  I felt disgusted early on, I laughed out load several times, I cried a LOT, I felt guilty, and I felt like cheering at some points.  I know very well that Michael Moore twisted and manipulated my emotions (and perhaps even some facts) – just like any other Hollywood filmmaker.  However, he is very good at it, and it has had a profound affect on me.  I do not regret seeing Fahrenheit 9/11 instead of spidey2 this weekend.  At $8.50, I feel like I got my money’s worth at the movie theater.  The only thing I’m disappointed about is that I can’t bring a copy of the movie home with me and dissect it piece by piece.  From my memory, I’ll recount some of my favorite parts.  I don’t think reading this will “spoil” it for you if you haven’t seen the movie yet, but if you are concerned about that don’t read on.  Gore v Bush (Florida) Moore spends very little time on this subject and it’s only in the very beginning.  What makes you get that ‘tisk-tisk’ feeling is how Moore connects every decision maker on the vote counting issue to George Bush or his family.  No wonder George was so confident of winning.  Even more powerful than this was the video of protestors during the inauguration.  Did you know Bush’s limo was pelted with eggs?  Did you know he was the first president that couldn’t take the traditional walk to the white house from outside because of all the protestors?  Why didn’t any of this make the news?  I remember FAIR.org complaining about this at the time but I had no idea just how strong or large the protest was.  Also, did you know the swearing-in ceremony was full of people with petitions to block or at least debate the installment of the president?  There was an endless procession of people who were given a chance to speak, but the first question they had to answer before speaking was “Do you have a signature from a senator?”  They had hundreds and thousands of signatures, but not one senator.  So they were set down, one by one.  It was moving video.  I felt angry.  George Bush’s reaction to 9/11 Now this is classic comedy.  George Bush was on camera in front a classroom full of kids when they told him the 2nd plane hit the WTC, and that America was under attack.  He looked dumbfounded.  With nobody there to tell him what to do, he just sat their dumbfounded as the clock ticked away (a clock Moore added to illustrate how long).  You don’t have to see the movie to know the look he had on his face.  He was not reading to the kids, as I had previously been told.  He was just sitting there while somebody else was talking.  His mouth was open a bit, his eyes empty – he clearly didn’t know what to do.  Remember, though, that he was aware of the 1st plane before he even entered the classroom.  This was his reaction to the 2nd plane.  We were all dumbstruck when we heard about it, but we don’t carry the burden of the being the leader of the free world.  While we all started wondering if we new anybody in the towers, who could do such a thing, what our response would be, who we were going to war with, etc., George Bush just sat there like a bump on a log catching flies in his open mouth.  Maybe my vision of leadership is too Hollywood for real life, but I have to tell you that I was disappointed in my leader.  It became very clear to me after watching this that I don’t hate George Bush.  How could you?  He’s an imbecile.  He’s just a puppet for other, more powerful people (including his dad).  Patriot Act To those of you who think the Patriot Act is a necessary tool to fight the war on terror I ask you to reconsider.  The Patriot Act trumps all kinds of civil liberties.  It was kept secret until it was printed in the middle of the night – the night before the vote was called.  It passed the next morning with nobody even having read it.  Moore asked a congressman about that and was told, “Sit down my son.  We don’t read most of the bills.”  I laughed aloud as Moore then talked an ice cream truck driver into driving around in front of capital hill as he read the patriot act aloud “to congress” on the loudspeaker with the familiar ice cream truck music going in the background.  He then went on to chronicle some of the groups and individuals targeted by Sheriffs and the FBI as potential terrorists.  This was both alarming and comical.  The Saudi Connection Moore carefully illustrates with pictures and facts about the influence of Saudi money in America.  For example, the Saudi embassy has nearly $900 Billion invested in America’s economy – measured to equal about 6 or 7%.  When Moore stood across the street from the Saudi embassy to interview a guy about all the money, the secret service showed up and started politely asking questions.  Moore: “I didn’t realize the secret service guards foreign embassies.”  Steve Kimball (SS guy): “Not usually, no sir.”  This exchange was absolutely hilarious in the theater, with the whole audience (a packed house) laughing out loud.  Moore goes too far sometimes.  He noted that Bush earns $400k as President, but the Saudi’s have given Bush and his business interests more than $1.4 Billion.  He went on to question Bush’s loyalties because of this.  War Footage This movie deserved its R rating.  The war footage is graphic.  You can clearly see bones sticking out of blown off limbs, US military wounded screaming in agony, charred and dead babies from bombs gone astray, Iraqi mothers wailing over their dead children.  There is footage through the lens of gun sights as Iraqi’s are shot and killed while trying to hide.  Army men sing some song with a refrain of “Burn mother fucker burn” as they blow up palaces.  At one point they call in an air strike of napalm only to discover they just melted women and children walking to the market.  Yes, you get to see the melting, screaming women as they die.  We all know these things happen in war - that you have to step back and look at the big picture.  What is the big picture again?  Did Iraq EVER attack the US or a US embassy?  No.  Did Iraq ever threaten to attack the US?  No.  Does Iraq harbor any terrorists responsible for 9/11? No.  Why was it again that we invaded them?  Oh yea, it was those weapons of mass destruction.  Good thing we solved that problem.  I cried a lot during these scenes of war.  You will too if you see the movie.  Military Recruiting Moore follows two marine recruiters in Flint, Michigan as they try to sign people up to fight the war.  They are very good at what they do.  They know to stay away from the malls where the well-off people are, because they don’t have any luck there.  They stick to the impoverished areas where people don’t have jobs.  It’s crazy how the people who sacrifice their lives for Bush and America are the people least served by Government.  Rich people don’t put their kids in the war.  Moore strikes out with a marine at one point in the movie and tries to get congressmen to sign up their children for the war in Iraq.  You can imagine their reaction.    I’m getting tired of writing, so I’ll wrap it up.  The movie ends with a wonderful clip of George Bush trying to talk.  We all know how humorous that can be.  I can’t quote exactly, because my memory isn’t that good, but he said, “There’s an old saying in Tennessee.  Well it’s a Texas saying but I’m sure they say it in Tennessee too.  Fool me once…(struggling pause)  and…it’s uh, shameful… (struggling pause).. and… well… the point is don’t get fooled.”  Check out the movie.

      Grammy is taking Emilie out to the farm tomorrow, so Kim and I will have Friday night to ourselves.  It's been awhile.  Too bad we're flat broke.  I think we may have to at least go see Farenheit 911.  What do people do on dates these days?  I'm getting awfully tired of dinner and a movie.  I'm not a dancer or a club hopper.  What am I left with?  No wonder so many of us have become couch potatoes.
