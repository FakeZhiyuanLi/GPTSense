      Well, It's been awhile but I'm back. I read a book the other day called   The Keys to Success   by Fred Crowell.  There was something he said in there that made me stop and think...                              "In light of God's resources, I refuse to accept my limitations." I looked at this two different ways.  We have two different types of limitations I believe.  Those that we put on ourselves, and those that others put on us.  Isn't it said that we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us?  HMMM.  Oh, well, just something to think about.

      I've been spending a lot of time recently talking to military recruiters.&nbsp; Some have been nice, some have been very persuasive, and yet the one i talked to today was the most boring woman I have ever sat and listened to...besides my old biology teacher.&nbsp; Now I am sitting in the pastor's office talking and doing nothing.&nbsp; It's quite fun.&nbsp; Fellowship is an awesome thing.&nbsp; Find a buddy.&nbsp; Sit and talk.

      I have come to the conclusion today that girlfriends are the biggest waste of time and money a 17 year old guy who just got in a car wreck can have.&nbsp; If you know me, keep me accountable on this.

      I'm spending time in California right now in a little town called Susanville.  Looking out over the valley and down at the Susan River, it made me stop and think...What an awesome God we have.  It's amazing to see the awesome display of the power that God has.  Don't ever take anything for granted.  If you do, hopefully soon God will show something that will just take your breath away.

      Well, all day yesterday I got to spend cramped up in the car with two very wound up sisters of mine.  We had a good time.  For awhile my mom and I listened to a tape series on living a Spirit led life.  The preacher made a very strong emphasis on the fact that the Holy Spirit is not an "it"..."it" saved me..."it" helped me through this...The Holy Spirit is a "He" I had never really thought about it that much.  Something to ponder...

      Today at work, I was stuck at the cash register.  We had no more than 10 people in the store at any given time.(KMart)  It was soooo boring that my supervisor and I ended up having a rubber band fight.  Yes, I've got welts.  I've discovered, that when you have a 5 hour shift on a federal holiday that involves fire-works, you will probably end up wanting to scream.

      Right now I am reading in a book called "So what's the Difference" by Fritz Ridenour.  It's a study of the differences between "orthodox" Christianity and other religions such as Buddhism, Mormonism, Islam...and Roman Catholicism?  I always thought that my faith as a Christian and the Roman Catholic faith were fairly close to the same thing.  What an eye opener.  This book went through everything from the Seven Sacraments to mortal and venial sins to pretty much everything about the Catholic church.  Boy am I glad that as a  Christian  I can read and interpret God's Word the way He reveals it to me, not through a priest.  The original New Testament was written in Greek.  Not the Greek used by the teachers and leaders of the day, but the common Greek that was spoken in the marketplaces and in the homes.  That's a suggestion to me that the Bible was not only for the authorities, but for everyone to interpret how they read the Word, IN CONTEXT.   crazy

      It seems that in times of trouble, people tend to turn to God more than any other time.  Why is it that most people aren’t reached until they reach a “breaking point?”  When the World Trade Center was destroyed, the amount of people in churches went up by around 42%.  People know where the answer is.  Yet, people don’t live the Answer.  There was a time historically where a group of people was living in sinful, worldly lives.  A man was sent to them to warn them of God’s judgement, and the entire city fell to their knees, begging for mercy.  We as Christians have been sent to tell a group of people about God’s judgement…but also how they can escape from that judgement through the love of Jesus Christ.  People today don’t react the way the people of Ninevah did, and my name isn’t Jonah.  But we are still called to be prophets, you could say.  Let’s get on our knees and plead for God’s mercy for our peers and coworkers, so that maybe they will react the way the people of Jonah’s day did.

           Ok, let's go on a journey.  You are a small-town kid with a big dream.  You save up using several summer and part-time jobs to pay for the big move to the big city.  You make it big.  Here you are now, in the movies, or singing songs when all of a sudden, cameras everywhere!  Flash here, click there!  You don't mind the attention...Until your problem starts.  Whether it be drugs, alcohol, women, or whatever!  Pretty soon everybody knows about it!  Why can't you just try and get help privately?  It's your problem, not ours.  I wouldn't want my addiction to be published in every tabloid from LA to NY.  Would you?  Why not let Mary-Kate or whomever just go through rehab without the emotional stress of having to deal with the press punks.  Freedom of Press versus Freedom of Privacy.

      Well, today I met with a cool kid at the beautiful haven known as Starbucks.  It's amazing how a cup of coffee will really affect how a 15 year old will open up.  In my meeting with him I have come to realize how much God has blessed me.  Especially in the area of family.  I also realized that you shouldn't take what God has given you for granted.  Always be thankful and never give up working your hardest for the things you have.
