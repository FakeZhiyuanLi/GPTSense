             It takes a lot to piss me off.&nbsp; I'm really easy-going and laid back, and I get along with 99% of the people I meet.&nbsp; But there are certain things that will make my blood pressure&nbsp;skyrocket in&nbsp;a matter of seconds.&nbsp; One of those things is people coming into&nbsp;our home and disrespect our things and not giving a shit about it.  &nbsp;  Justin came down Thursday night and basically the whole time he was here, he was a complete slob.&nbsp; He got bowl resin all over Todd's desk and didn't bother to clean it up.&nbsp; He left crumbs all over the kitchen counter.&nbsp; When Debby picked him up (after he called her to come and get him because he was bored), he didn't put his pillows away or fold up the blanket, and he left half a cracker on the floor and half a can of Mt. Dew on the coffee table.&nbsp; Oh yes, and he made some long-distance phone calls.  &nbsp;   What the fuck? &nbsp; He's fucking 15 years old and doesn't give a shit about the things around him, even if they're not his things.&nbsp; What an ungrateful little asshole.&nbsp; Todd told Debby that he was the nastiest fucking kid he's ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rudest.  &nbsp;  I will give him  some  credit though, because he came down clean and actually took a shower while he was here.&nbsp; That's more than I can say about the last time he was down.&nbsp; He hadn't showered in two days and his feet were so fucking disgusting-smelling that we had to leave the camper and come home at 2am and force him to take a shower.&nbsp; On top of that, he had athlete's foot.  &nbsp;  What I don't understand is how he can have a girlfriend and an ex-girlfriend that chases after him, because he doesn't give a rat's ass about anything, including personal hygiene.  &nbsp;   Grow the fuck up.

       I got out of class early, thank God.  Today was reader's theater and all went well.  My group's kids did pretty decent; they skipped a few lines toward the end though.  All in all, I was impressed with them because one of the girls didn't show up and one of the boys who hadn't been there for any of the practices did show up, and everything went smoothly.  Of course the rich, snobby bitches that sit at the front table (and are pretty much stuck up the prof's ass) went completely overboard with their skit and song.  I can't wait until they have to actually  earn  something that they want instead of having it just handed to them like everything else has been.  I need a shower before I go to work.  So here's something not many people know about me.  I like to smoke weed, and I have been just about every day for the past couple of months.  However, as much as I like getting high/stoned, I am giving it up.  For one thing, it's bad for my health.  But the real reasons that I'm giving it up are that I have too much going for me right now and I can't afford to fuck it up.  Weed makes me stupid.  I have very little short-term memory right now, and that's not a good thing at all.  Plus, starting on July 20 I'm going to be taking two math classes and if you know me, math is my worst subject.  I can't afford to fail these classes because if I do I can't student teach, and I won't be able to graduate in December.  Also, I've noticed that during the past few months I haven't really given a shit about what I'm doing.  Like I'm not sure if I even want to teach.  Part of it is burnout because I've been taking classes nonstop since last July, but a lot of it is the weed, too.  It's starting to make me lose focus.  I don't want that to happen.  I don't need that to happen.  Teaching is what I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life, and if I'm already starting to not care about it (or really not even want to do it) then the only thing I've done is waste a shitload of money, time, and effort.  So many people would be insanely disappointed in me.  Ultimately, I would be a total failure.  It's time that I take my priorities and place them in the right order, which is what I've made the conscious decision to do.  Will it be hard?  Of course.  It's always hard to stop doing something you have a good time doing.  But with patience and willpower, I can do it.  I  will  do it.  Thank you.

        So I'm trying to make my blog post some of my favorite links and I can't figure it out. I'm getting pretty pissed about it.   Maybe I should eat something... No more goulash though. It was very good and I'll eat it again in the future but as for the leftovers in the fridge, please dear God don't make me eat anymore. Blah.   Fucking blog.

       This is my first post.  Well, technically, it's not.  I have a weblog/journal at  urlLink LiveJournal  that I have been keeping since October 2003.  However, I'm getting quite bored with it because there isn't much you can really do with is.  I decided to explore my options as far as weblogs are concerned, and as you can see, I ended up here.  I liked using LJ, but after a while I started getting bored with it because really, there's only so much you can do with a free account.  Hopefully this will better suit my needs.  What I'm struggling with right now is whether or not I want to be brutally honest with this thing.  Yes, I am a good, honest person but do I really want to post  everything  that I'm thinking or do I want to conveniently leave out specific details about my personal life, like I have with LJ.  It would be a different tactic to try with this weblog, and I'm sure it'd make me seem that much more interesting to those who happen to stumble across this page.  I'll have to think about it some more.  I should go ahead and end this now because I read somewhere on Blogger that they're going to be doing some maintencance this evening and I don't want this entire post to be lost because I didn't publish it in time.  Adios, amigos.

         I guess I'm glad it's Saturday... I don't have to go to work or go to class. However, I still have to do a bunch of homework and catch up on the housework I've been neglecting. I think I said that in my last post.   I got a lot of housework done last night; I did the dishes and changed the cages and gave the piggies their much-needed baths. Today I still need to do more dishes, refill the fish tank, clean the bathroom, and do the laundry. Oh, and pay the bills. One of them, at least, since Todd isn't going to pick up his check until Monday.   I was thinking about getting my hair trimmed today. I desperately need to. I also really need to go down to Earthborn and get a 10-gauge retainer stud for my tongue, since I seriously doubt that it's kosher that I have one while I'm student teaching. Guess I'll have to put that off until Monday.   I am going to go work out today, woohoo! I really need to, especially since I was bad yesterday. I did okay for breakfast, eating some cantaloupe. But the office ordered Red Lobster for lunch and I had a Caesar salad, two of their cheesy garlic biscuits, and a big plate of shrimp and lobster linguine. It was good, but I'm sure there was about a million calories in all of it. Then later, Kelly went to Dairy Queen for everyone and I ended up getting a small strawberry cheesecake blizzard (my favorite). Later in the evening I had a Mt. Dew and a couple slices of pizza. Ooh I was so bad yesterday. So when Todd leaves I'm going to go to the Y and do some running, do some weights, and then some more running. And I'm going to attempt to read chapters 3 and 4 for math methods while I'm doing that.   Todd has started calling me Noodles instead of Butthead. I can't stand that nickname... It's fucking ridiculous! I'd rather be called Butthead, to be honest. LOL I swear he comes up with the craziest shit sometimes.   Speaking of Todd, he's going to go over to Harrisburg today and then he and Tyler are going to Metropolis to play in a pool tournament. I'm going to stay here so I can catch up on everything, which is what I'd rather do anyway because Donna's going to be working and I wouldn't want to go watch the guys play pool. Todd told me that the tourney doesn't start until like 7pm, so he'll probably end up staying in Harrisburg for the night. Woohoo house to myself! Whatever will I do? Maybe once I get everything done, I'll finish the rest of the margarita mix that's in the fridge.   I'm kinda hungry. Mmmmmm waffles. Blueberry waffles!   Damn my ankle itches... I put some hydrocortisone cream on it but it doesn't seem to be helping much, so I'm doing the best that I can to ignore it. I wonder if it has anything to do with the Olux or the fact that I have stopped using it like the Dr. told me to. I'm going to see him for a follow-up on Tuesday... I wonder what he's going to say. My arms are now 99.9% clear but you can still see the spots on my legs although they are fading.   Alright, I'm going to get going so I can do something productive with myself.

          Holy shit has it been a busy week!    Summer III started on Tuesday, and this time around I’m taking two classes instead of only one. I’m retaking Math 205 (Computer Science) since I didn’t pass when I took with Stegemoller in the spring, and one runs Monday-Thursday, 8-930am. Most of the work is done in class, so I’m not too worried about that class. Plus, this guy Ritterskamp has already taught me more than Stegemoller ever did and it’s only the third day of class. So I’m pretty happy about that. My Math Methods class is a little tougher, but it’s not as bad as I was thinking it was going to be. That class runs Tuesday-Thursday, 415-715pm, which sucks because those are the only nights that Todd is home early. But, at least it’s only for a month. The prof is pretty strict and the workload is going to be like those of my previous methods classes, but it’s nothing I can’t handle. At least we’re not doing formulas and whatnot; this class is more like the psychology behind teaching math, and it’s actually kind of interesting.     I’m really happy I don’t have classes on Fridays because that way I can work all day and my mind can take a break from thinking in school mode for three days. Yeah right. I still have a shitload of work to do for class plus I have to catch up on the housework I’ve englected for the past few days. The cages, dishes, vacuuming, my desk, the bathroom…     Todd is wanting to go over to Harrisburg to play pool with Tyler and to visit Reger’s grave since he’s taking Saturday and Sunday off. I don’t mind if he wants to go, but I’ve got too much to do to go over there with him. I haven’t told him that yet, but I will tonight. I really hope that doesn’t deter him from going because I know he wants to. Hell, I want to go too, but it’s just not feasible on my end right now.    Sunday, Todd and I got new sneakers. I got a pair of white New Balance cross-trainers; the first new pair of sneakers I’ve had in I don’t know how long. I’ve always heard that New Balance shoes are really comfortable, and that they are. Of course, they  are  new shoes so they’re bound to feel ten times better than my old ratty Adidas sneakers did. Anyway, so I only got to wear them like twice before a hole was torn in the side. I’m not sure if it happened on one of the machines at the YMCA or if I inadvertently kicked something, but yesterday I took them back and exchanged them for a brand new pair. So once again, I am happy.    I’m so glad it’s Thursday. The last day of classes for the week, yippee! I’m thinking that when I get home I’m going to do the dishes, clean the cages, and do some homework, but I seriously doubt I’ll be that ambitious. Todd will be at Sky’s for his pool league, so he won’t be home when I get there. Maybe I’ll just take off all my clothes, have a nice hot shower, and drink a tall margarita while surfing the net.    Sounds like a great plan to me.

       Shelley called me last night and told me that Paul is coming home this week!!!  He's flying out today but since it's such a long flight, it probably won't be until tomorrow when he gets back into the States.  Yay!!!  I'm so excited for them!  It's been so hard for the both of them this past year with him being in Japan.  Not to mention the fact that it was their first year of marriage.  But now he's coming home, wooooooohoooooooooo!  Of course this means that they're going to be moving to North Carolina soon.  Probably within the next two to three weeks.  That'll suck, because I won't ever get to see them.  But when you think about it, how often do I get to see Shelley anyway and she's right here in town.  I will have to spend some extra time with her before they leave for NC.  If I can get her out of the house, if you know what I mean.    I'm working all day today because I don't have class.  Then tomorrow classes start, and I'm going to be super-busy.  I'll have one of my math classes from 8-930am on Monday-Thursday, then my second math class will be from 415-715pm on Tuesday-Thursday.  Not too happy about having to be away in the evenings, but it's what I have to do.  However, it's only for a month.  Not too big of a deal.  I sure will be glad once it's over though...  Yet super-nervous because then I go into student-teaching!    I need to get off here so that I can start getting ready for work.  Have a great day!!!

       I'm in an okay mood today.  I was pretty shitty when I got up because I'm still so tired (mentally) and I didn't want to have to work today.  I did sleep in until 7am, and that made me a little happy.  I got to work, and nothing was planned for my birthday.  I'm not surprised though because several people in our office are on vacation, including the one person I share July as a birth month with.  I think they're going to do something on Monday because when I came in yesterday, Cat asked me what time I will be in on Monday morning.  I don't know though.  Not too worried about it, to be truthful.  Dad took me out to lunch at Lone Star and it was nice.  It improved my mood substantially, that's for sure.  We had a good meal and talked about things.  I got to vent about being so stressed about school, which made me feel a ton better.  He assured me that my hard work is not going unnoticed and that he (and Sharon) are very proud of me.  I'm glad he told me that because even though I know it, it works wonders on my confidence when I actually hear it from someone.  After lunch we stopped by Batteries Plus where Dad gave him something that was in the paper (Dad wouldn't tell me what it was, but I suspect it was prices on digital cameras) and Todd came out to the car and gave me a birthday kiss.  I talked to Shelley and she and Paul are going to meet me and Todd at the Hilltop Inn tonight for dinner.  That should be fun.  I'm going to get me some catfish fiddlers, mmm-mmm!  First though, I'm going to go home after I get off of work and I'm going to run a nice, hot bubble bath, pop open a beer (or pour a margarita), turn on some classical music and I'm going to pamper myself.  Fuck.  Mom's mad.  I don't know who exactly she's mad at though.  She called me earlier and I missed her call.  So I called her back and left a message for her to call me back, which she did.  Well she's disappointed that me and Shelley and Paul and Todd are going out to dinner but they weren't invited.  She said, "Don't you remember me asking if you wanted to do something last week?"  I told her, "Yes, and I told you that I am so stressed out about school that I didn't want to think about it so I left it up to Shelley and Todd.  Shelley called Todd and they got everything straightened out and I said that was fine."  She said, "Well it would have been nice if they would have thought of other people.  I would have called Todd but I didn't have his number."  I said, "Well, I told Shelley to call Todd and talk to him about it."  "Well, she didn't say anything to me.  Well, I hope you all have a nice dinner."  "I'm sorry she didn't say anything about it to you.  I'll stop by there tomorrow."  "Well, call to make sure we're there.  Talk to you later."  Now I feel like shit because Shelley's lack of consideration for others.  God damnit.  It's my fucking birthday!  I don't want to do a damn thing, now.  After dinner I guess Todd and I are going to go home and watch  Mystic River , even though I have no desire to watch that movie.  I'm just not into movies anymore.  It'll probably be good.  I should try to be positive, huh?  Yeah, good luck.  Maybe I'll get lucky and smoke a bowl.

        I want to take a nap.  I'm leaving early today so I think I'll go home and take a quick nap before I have to go to class.  But I just had a Mt. Dew so that probably won't be accomplished.  My eye hurts for some reason...  It hurts whenever I blink.  Tomorrow's my birthday and I want a digital camera.  The one we have now is too big and clunky and the photos aren't the best quality and the zoom in/out button rarely works anymore.  Plus tomorrow's my birthday!  Todd's concerned with spending that much money on a camera when he has spent more money on cues and other miscellaneous pool stuff than I would spend on a camera.  Not fair.  I probably won't get it.  Oh well, it's not like we need to spend that type of money on me anyway.  There are other, more important things that it could be spent on.  Like pool.  *rolls eyes*

       I know I know, I'm on a roll with the bitching but can you blame me?  I absolutely hate it that every single morning I wake up and I am burning up until the time that I leave.  I even turn down the air to like 71-72 but I still feel like I'm on fire.  Ugh.  It's the same way at work, too.  The girls will all be freezing their asses off but I'm comfortable, then when they turn up the air so that they are comfortable, I'm burning up.  It's madness, I tell you.  And that paper that I finished writing yesterday...  That has got to be the shittiest paper ever.  I waited until this morning before I printed it out so that I could proofread it one last time and I know that it's a shitty paper but there isn't anything else that I can come up with to change that fact.  I've got to get ready to leave.

       I am so fucking  sick  of doing homework.  That's all I've done this weekend, besides housework.  I swear to God I'm going crazy...  This paper I've just finished writing is one of the hardest I've ever had to write.  Well it wasn't really the hardest in terms of topic (it was just a comparison paper between the NCTM National standards and the Indiana State standards) but it was the hardest for me to put into words.  Ugh.

       Damn.    I can't believe how much I've busted my ass these past three weeks for school.  I've got an 84% so far...  Two weeks to go.  I'm hungry but I would have to fix anything that I want to eat.    Not much is going on besides school and work.  Three weeks until my last day.  I can't believe it.  I hate to use this cliche but it seems like I started at the Building Commission yesterday.  I have never had a better job in my life.  I love the people I work with, I love what I do...  I have a lot of fun with them all.  I am going to miss them so much.  I am so glad mom helped with the laundry today; it helped so much.  I will be able to get more stuff done tomorrow since I won't have to take time out for that.  I study while I'm at the laundromat but it's all the getting stuff together, going to the ATM, going to the laundromat, loading four separate washers and dryers and folding it all then driving back home and getting it out of the car and bringing it in and folding it..  That's what takes so much time.    I'm hungry.

       When was the last time I mentioned that I am fucking exhausted and I am sick of going to school? Oh, that would have been about 5 minutes ago.  One week to go.  Mrs. Wells is a fucking bitch and I can't stand her. I hate the way she talks, I hate her voice, I hate looking at her. Fatass bitch.  Fucked up the pizza last night because I'm too stupid to figure out that if I take the number of carbs per slice, multiply it by 5, then divide it by the number of slices I did end up cutting then I could figure out how many per slice.  I tell you I'm not good for anything sometimes.  Excuse me for fucking shit up.  I'm not going to go on because I'm already in a shitty mood.   I AM FUCKING EXHAUSTED AND I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.   Fuck this shit.

       I managed to piss Todd off on his day off. Way to go, Jen. I went home after class and Todd was still in bed but he got up because I was home. He was on the couch and I was ironing when the phone rang. I went over to my desk to check the Caller ID and it said that it was Debby calling. I told Todd that it was her and he asked me to answer the phone. By this time I had gone back over to the ironing board and I snapped at him " You  answer the phone, she's  your  mom." That was a really bad idea. The phone stopped ringing when the answering machine picked up and Todd got mad at me because he had something in his mouth and I didn't know about it. That's the only reason I told him to answer the phone; because I thought he was just laying there. I had no idea something was in his mouth at the time. I thought he'd swallowed it. Anyway, so he is pissed at me because I was rude and he'd just gotten up. I said that I was sorry (a couple times) for being rude and that I was sorry for pissing him off. Damnit I hate it when I do that. I didn't think about what he was doing, I just opened my mouth and snapped at him. Sometimes I am such an idiot.  What I plan on doing is leaving him alone for the day so he can brood about me pissing him off and hopefully get over it, then when I go home after Math Methods I'm going to stop by Subway and pick up some dinner so he doesn't have to eat another Lean Pocket.  Karen called me last night and said that their gathering was moved from Tuesday night to Thursday night. I'll get out of class at 7pm so I would be able to make it, but I probably won't go because I'm tuckered out from school on Thursday nights and I will want to get a head start on my homework for the next week. Plus work on that damn activities notebook.  I don't have anything to do right now, so I'm going to act like I'm working. I'm hoping the time will pass quickly. It usually does; time passes almost too fast now.

       I'm going to stop getting my nails done.  I like having them done but I just don' t need the extra thing to take care of nor do I want to spend $40+ per month to have someone fuck them up.  I'm kinda pissed because the other day I burned 5 copies of my SIME favorites CD that I'm going to send out and when I tried to burn a 6th copy this morning it said that some of the songs wouldn't fit on the CD.  I will probably have to go and drag each individual song into the Windows Media Player so that they will all fit because when I was trying to do it this morning (in a hurry because I want to mail those things today) it wouldn't work.  I'll probably end up mailing them tomorrow.  We tried to shampoo the living room carpets last night but Debby's machine is a piece of shit and didn't do much.  The carpet does look better, but it's nowhere near as clean as it should be.  Todd's off today and he might fuck with it some more.  Fuck.  Class started.

       I have  got  to get my nails redone. The girl who did them when I went to Lovely Nails last week is still pretty new and she fucked them up. A few of my nails have dents in them where she didn't file the tops down very well and the edges around my cuticles are really rough. Not to mention that it's only been a week and I am in serious need of a fill-in. Oh yeah, and when she did my nails it took an hour and a half for a damn fill-in. It should only take 30 minutes, 45 minutes tops. That's why I always request Tony to do my nails. But he's always so busy with other requests and appointments that it's almost impossible to get him to do my nails. So this is the second time she's done my nails and it's the last. I'm not going to go back there. I want to go to the woman that Ashlie went to when she was still in Evansville, but I can't remember her name or where she works. She files everything by hand instead of using a dremel, which I like, and she's not much more expensive than these places I've been going.   I sent Ashlie an email last week asking her the girl's name but I haven't heard back from her yet. I don't imagine that I will until they get settled in their new place. So for now I'm going to go to the place Karen went to last week. I need to take the ones I have off, but I don't want to have to sit with my hands soaking in acetone for God knows how long. Sure I'd cut the tips off for it to take less time but I'd still have to soak them. I keep trying to talk myself out of a new set until next month but I really want a french manicure again and if I have it done with the nails I have, it's going to look fucked up. So I guess I'll have to take these fuckers off sometime this week.  This weekend was actually pretty good. Volksfest was going on but we didn't make it down there this year. Todd was hungover all Friday because he went out on Thursday to his pool league and didn't get home until 430am Friday morning. I wasn't too happy about that but I guess I felt okay about it because he ended up feeling like shit all day. He brought it on himself so I wasn't going to bitch about it. Serves him right. Anyway, so Friday night I talked to Karen for a while and then ended up staying home with Todd, which was nice. I didn't do any homework so I actually got to spend some time with him. Mom did the laundry for me on Friday so I had all of Saturday to do what I wanted, which was great. I fucked around on the computer for a while making my SIME CD that I need to send out, then I picked up Todd's check and bought him some lunch from Chick-Fil-A. I went to the mall and got my hair trimmed and bought a clear tongue stud for when I start student teaching. I stopped by the Italian charm place but didn't get anything because I didn't want to stand there and look at them all and they're kind of expensive anyway. I'd already spent enough money. So I was leaving and I made a pit stop at the candy store. Bought about a pound of Jelly Bellies, mmm. God I am going to make myself so sick. It's amazing that with all the junk food I've been eating for the past month that I've lost 6 pounds. I feel like shit though because of all the junk food. Blah. Anyway, I had to go to the Teachers' Aid for class and that wasn't too bad. I'm a sucker for school supplies so I liked having to go down there. It was really cool because instead of having to remember everything I looked at or taking in a pen and pad of paper, I just typed up my whole report on my Palm, then downloaded it to my computer. I love my Palm. Then it was off to WalMart, where I spent an hour shopping and another hour waiting to check out. It always amazes me that WalMart has ~30 check out lanes but they only have like 5 of them open at a time. It also pisses me off that their commercials brag about how fast it is to get in and get out while getting everything you need, but that's total bullshit. Anyway, then I went home and put the food away and did the dishes and vacuumed and put the clothes away and made the bed... I was so productive!  I thought Todd and I were going to go to Volksfest but he called me from work and said that he was going to go down to Jimtown Bar to play in a pool tournament. That was fine with me because I wanted to go to Karen's to hang out, which I did. That was cool because I got to see her and Bobby and the kids, I had a good meal, and Bobby made it worth my while with a little gift (and gave me some to take home). I got home at 11pm and Todd walked in the door like 5 minutes later. He wasn't too happy about the fact that I'd smoked with Bobby and he was skeptical that Bobby would just give me some with no strings attached, but after a few minutes he let it go, which I was happy about. The last thing I wanted was to fight about it. I understand why he's uncomfortable about it, but there are things that I am uncomfortable with that he does that I just let go. And it's not like I do it all the time. Anyway...  Sunday we slept in but the day wasn't wasted. We got the trash taken out and cleaned the porch off really well, plus the sidewalk next to the porch. We dusted and washed off the furniture, and dusted and lubed the bike which I took out for a short spin. I should do that more often. We smoked a bowl, had awesome sex, then went to Dad's for dinner with him and Sharon, and Shelley and Paul. I brought home some stuff that Sharon had given me but Todd gave me some shit about it because he's always saying that I bring stuff home regardless of whether we need it or not. That's true, but I had plans for the stuff that was in the bag. But I didn't want to hear him complain about it and he was right anyway, so as soon as we got home, I pitched it. We talked about it some more when we got in the house and I brought up the fact that he brings shit that we don't need home too, though he might not do it as much as I do. We finally just let it go and then later he said that he felt bad for making me throw the stuff out. I told him to not feel bad because he didn't make me do anything and he was right.  Anyway, so now I just got done with class. Two weeks left, thank God.
