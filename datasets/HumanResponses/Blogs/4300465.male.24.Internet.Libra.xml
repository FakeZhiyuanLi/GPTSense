      Okay. I have three, count 'em,  three   urlLink GMail  accounts  I can give away . I checked with  urlLink GmailSwap  and there were no intelligent or worthy trades.  So let me know in the comment link below if you want one, and why, and what you may have to offer in return.  I'm throwin' it all out. I've got three invites today and that's it.

      If you're a reader of my  urlLink previous blog , you'd know up front that I'm a huge  urlLink Lisa Loeb  fan; I have been for 10 years. It pretty much comes down to the fact that if you were living and breathing past May 1994-- you'd know her  urlLink trademark song . Who doesn't.  What I'm debating is if I am going to go to an appearance of hers just 30 miles away in Los Angeles on  urlLink Wednesday night . She's playing at  urlLink The Grove  with American Idol's Kimberly Locke as a part of The Grove's every-Wednesday-night Summer Concert Series. There's supposed to be, and I'm guessing here, a few thousand people scheduled to show up. Just a couple weekends ago Jada Pinkett-Smith and her band performed, as her husband, actor Will Smith, made a surprising "jump onto the stage" appearance and sang his 1991 hit  "Summertime"  which drew heavy media attention. I watched the news that night when it aired and it was mentioned of Lisa's and Kimberly's appearance for this Wednesday.  I'd like to go because I support Lisa Loeb and any concert she gives just plain rocks. As a matter of fact-- I just saw her in concert at The Greek Theatre, just over three weeks ago, up in the Griffith Park area of Los Angeles-- in the Los Feliz neighborhood. It was great. She opened for  Heart . After her performance, before Heart took the stage, Lisa went outside the seating area and met with dozens of fans in the merchandise booth and autographed many  urlLink CDs ,  urlLink pictures  and her children's book.  If you're on Lisa's mailing list (e-mail) and/or a frequenter of her website (or forum member thereof, such as yours truly), you will have been made aware of the following information:     Lisa wanted to make sure you knew she was playing at THE GROVE (the outdoor mall on Fairfax and 3rd Street in Los Angeles) on Wednesday, August 25 at 7:30PM. It is a free show and she will be signing CD's after at the Barnes and Noble. Come on down- it should be fun.    The only thing is-- she'll announce this during her concert and you just watch how many people will just run  urlLink across the street  to the Barnes and Noble just to wait for her. This happened at the concert a few weeks ago. I loved it. What's really interesting is that Lisa's website is reporting that actor Jeff Goldblum will also be appearing with those two. But anyhow it starts at 7, but her set begins at 8. That's really cool-- given L.A. traffic could take that extra hour!  On a side note: Lisa appeared at Largo tonight-- which is a  urlLink dinner club . It was one of those that if you didn't make reservations ahead of time-- you were outta luck. That should have been a nice performance tonight. I tend to favor her smaller venue appearances as they are more personal.  So we'll see. I just thought I would dribble this out before heading to bed. Maybe this will help make up my mind on going. My thing is that I just can't stand large crowds. I've been to places, of the greatest enjoyment, and have my day/night ruined because of crowds. But this is Lisa Loeb we're talkin' here. As a true fan, Lisa's worth battling a large herd.

      As I  urlLink mentioned earlier , I found a website called  urlLink deviantART , which was through a website of a fellow Blogger.com subscriber. As we know-- I can't subscribe to deviantART, but that doesn't mean I can't turn a negative thing around into a positive.  The fellow Blogger in question is a girl named  urlLink Jeanette , a southern Texas gal, who has a very nice photograph gallery of pictures she has taken with her own digital camera. What enlightens me is the same style pictures I have taken myself. The outdoors, family, home and vacations-- all in which  urlLink I have done . I am making a separate gallery for my more prestigous pictures-- which is what I had wanted deviantART for.  Jeanette has taken good use of light and dark with a mix of symmetry in her pictures, along with the vibrancy of color. My particular favorites are  urlLink the stairs  and the  urlLink sunflower .  She has a few photo galleries...and I would like for you to check them out! Not bad for a college student who works too much.    urlLink deviantART: jlea   urlLink idiotinsulted's photos   urlLink the Mind's Eye  (her webpage)

          Jeff Slagle Original   A 1970s sofabed   So last night I'm sitting here at my desk, and one of my good friends,  urlLink Jeff , instant messaged me and wanted to know how to get rid of a couch. As I inquired, he states that his father had purchased a new one for their den, and he was wanting to unload their old one-- which has been in there home since it was brand-spanking new (sometime in the mid-1970s). It just so happened that I was going to hunt for a small couch for our living room here of the townhouse I share. My buddy who owns it, whose girlfriend used to live here, took the original couch with her when she moved into her own apartment. So lately I've been hankering to find something to suit as it's been hard to entertain company when there is nothing more than the recliner to sit on in the living room.  So this was a perfect deal. I drove over to Jeff's place in Anaheim and he and I hauled back on over here in my truck and walla-- there you have it. We thought we lost one of the armrest covers on the 91 freeway, but sure enough-- we hadn't. It was nothin' doin' to get it inside my door and onto the floor and up against the wall. That's two sofa beds I now own. My other one is sitting in storage at another buddy's house, whom I used to room with, collecting dust. I was going to go get that one, but it weighs 300 pounds as the metal framing is thicker and the mattress is bulkier. It was hell getting up the stairs where it is stored now-- on a second story structure. So it's gonna wait until I go to my new place-- whenever that may be.

      I happened across a great website where you could post your own pictures and artwork. It's called  urlLink deviant  urlLink ART . I actually found this through Jeanette's blog,  urlLink the mind's Eye . With all my digital photography I do, this was to be perfect.  Well, not exactly.  deviantART has banned Earthlink internet customers from signing up for an account. Apparently someone did some goofing off and now ruined it for the rest of us. :(  Oh well.

      ... I recommend the  urlLink Automatic Enkoder Form . I've used it for two years and it works. It's based on encryption technology that blocks the spam robots from snagging your address and storing onto the thousands of automatic lists out there. So to say the least, I have not recieved many e-mails with offers to enlarge certain body parts, WindowsXP for $80 or all the Vicodin in the world for a couple bucks. It's a great tool for web site designers and webmasters.

      Well, that's what you do when you get off. I ended my previous blog under a week ago. It became larger than life and I, incidentally, had an extensive fan following. So why would I end it? It's not the fact that I went out while I was on top, but rather it became more than I wanted it to be. I actually said too much in that blog. I will still share life's woes and upliftings, but I'm going to have to leave out the  urlLink pretty language . I also found out that girls just don't dig it when a man gets liberal with the mouth. It was Ms. Blevins, my sophomore English teacher at  urlLink Sonora High School  in La Habra, who said it best:  diarrhea of the mouth . She wasn't kidding and I should have learned. After all, it took me ten years to figure that one out.  It's creeping upwards to 2am. I have not stayed up this late in a couple weeks (surprisingly). I have been aiming for an approximate midnight bedtime with an earlier time of waking up the next morning. I think tonight I will break that rule just once; a full hour of Three's Company is on next.
