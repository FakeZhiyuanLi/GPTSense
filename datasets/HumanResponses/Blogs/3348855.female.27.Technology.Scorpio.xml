       Once on chance impulse I stopped a happy crazy thought it was to visit with the tarot reader on summer soltices day  A big and busy fair it had been with silly friends I had been seen bubbling with all the skepticism I shook hands with a mysterious man  He spoke in hindi to my surprise had lived in pune at Osho's premise inquired with polite grace what I pressing issues I meant to trace  Alas if only I had no worries I spoke of the one thing on my mind he spread the cards across the table I picked one as I was able  With fan and flare he proceeded its the "Ahha" card he conceeded An impending revelation - a sudden flash of  comprehension was to delight me!  I must certainly have looked confounded for quite unnecesarily he expounded words I wished he wouldn't have spoken wounds I wished he wouldn't have opened  All the turmoil - I know I bolted into the temporary respite of sounds and sights a crowd had gather around to cheer an honest street artist conquer his fears.

       Knowing how to fight to the very end, yet having the wisdom  to give up on a spent cause  Flowing quickly like a stream, yet having the ability to slow down and pause  Expanding - growing like a cloud, yet knowing boundaries of where to stop  Loving caring and forgiving yet knowing when to give in no more.

       I've always been a little unsure Is this my friend for evermore?  People change and drift apart can I really count on this one heart  To spill the beans - no holds barred to show myself - the pretty and the dark  The scars and fears, and still be cherished still be told "You can be so much more"  calm and clear, I must remember  to rejoice in simple things - like his voice.

       Solving puzzles, its always been fun - Working with the pieces in my hands. Has it always been the easier ones?  To the same puzzle - again and again. Has anything changed? Has it been a few years? already!  So set - am I? In my approaches and solutions. So dependent on the same set of tools.  Are these shackles or is it just me - Have I turned into my own enemy?

       With my back to the wall the wind in my hair I stand poised, about to take off into the open wide skies  Some exhilaration, a little trepidation my mind is made, a chance I'll take - just to find out what it will be like  It is his voice, barely a whisper, that calls my name - I stop to consider.  The view is nice, from this ledge on the twenty fourth floor of IDX tower, I'll step away for now - however.

       My thoughts, like leaves  on a forest floor, by gusts of autumn wind, have all been strewn around.  Quick now, lightening fast I leap from thought to thought and leaf to leaf to grasp and hold but a chosen few from all those that have gone askew.  This one's interesting, that one's fine no not that one, oh - this one isn't even mine In youthful frivolity I do not mark the stealthy passing of the time.  Why the shock, the surprise, the horror when in a pools broken faded mirror stooped over the forest floor, I see an old old .... old me!
