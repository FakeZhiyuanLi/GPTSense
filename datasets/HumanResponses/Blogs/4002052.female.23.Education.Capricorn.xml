       I did it !  Congratulations to me!  Finally... now I can sleep peacefully. Heh!  Just a thought. No wonder people say that even if you have been friends with someone for a long time, you will still learn new things about that person. I've been with him for 6 years and we've really been through a lot together. BUt it has been a great learning experience and all those ups and downs have, in their own special ways, helped to strengthen the bond and feelings that we share. He's one person I am really comfortable with ... as he knows my character inside out and I don't have to explain much. Simply because he knows..  Now , what's my point? the point is I am finding it a little difficult to handle  changes/ mood swings/ watever you call it with new friends. For the past ten years, I have only been close to two people  -- my best friend and him. They are the only ones who know me well enough to predict my future actions, to know when to keep away and leave me alone.. blah blah....could it be that because of this, I've lost that skill to handle differences with new friends? Don't get me wrong... I can get along easily and pretty well with people...just that sometimes frustration gets to me when I can't understand the rationale behind some of their actions. Of course not everything can be rationalized.... but it just gives me headaches sometimes.  I guess this would just be another learning journey. :-)  okies....back to work. I am to finish three piles of test papers over the weekend. .. good night all.

Then , I stumbled upon a friend's fresh-from-the-oven new blog...and there are pictures! So yes, the determined me shall try .... if it doesn't come out, pls don't laugh. I'll laugh at myself voluntarily   ..* winks*

      Today was a heavily-packed-with-lessons day. Had only   one   break throughout.. Gobbled down my mee soto as quickly as I could. Wanted to prepare for tomorrow's English lesson but there was just not enough time.   Currently, in my English course ( hahah....). the course is something about using technology in teaching English ...therefore, I have access to the Internet. Pretty bored with the lecturer so I decided to update the blog.   Anyway, back to school.... Had a   fulfilling   lesson with&nbsp;one of my sec&nbsp;3 classes. the class&nbsp;consists of a&nbsp;bunch of restless students.Most of the time, they can't keep still. ALways need to chit chat a little, then do some work... play around a bit then back to work. Just now was    splendid   . I decided to be&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;a bad mood so I stepped in with a black face. Taught for&nbsp;abt 20 mins then made them do exercise. Told them they can't go home if they can't finish...I even locked the doors...haha..it worked. But one guy tried to play a fool and wanted to bring his work back with the excuse that school was ending....Stayed back with him until he finished it....:-P SOmetimes I wonder what they come to school for if they just want to be lazy. I don't remember being like that last time....or should I ask my teachers first before claiming anything?   There's no major concern on my mind at the moment. just work. boring? yeah, I think so too. I'm boring myself to death ( is that correct structure? heck. who cares...)

         Burp....   he he .  Sorry , excuse me. just had my brunch ..chicken rice today . nice nice.      but guess what ? I actually forgot to go into one Math class today. No wonder my break felt like ages... berkat agaknya. Have been feeling tired, a little out of 'range' ... think I'm rather exhausted with all e stuffs going on around me.        &nbsp;   I want to go rollerblading... haven't done so for quite some time. My body needs to sweat it out and my blades need the exercise too. Fri? Sun? If I can squeeze some time out of the busy schedule....       &nbsp;   Anyway, something sad happened. A sec 2 girl passed away last night , asthma attack. I don't know her as I've never&nbsp;taught the class before. But I emphatise with the class. It must be real difficult to lose someone. Kinda gone through that before , though not this serious. Just hope God gives the family and friends the strength to go on with life.      :-( Cherish what you have. You'll never know how precious something is until it is gone.        &nbsp;   To my family....  I love you...

      He's back to being his 'idiotic', yet super-lovable self. Phew! The agony of worrying for him.... so glad he's fine now.But that cute monchichi is now having hiccups! hahha... he claimed nak besar...ntah apa ntah yg nak besar :-)  My dad had quite a lot of visitors just now. I didn't really want to go down to the hospital because of the workload. But decided to go in the end as I forsee myself not going down tomorrow. Sigh... I know my entries had all been about him and my dad. But i guess I couldn't help it. They are the only two things / worries on my mind at the moment. Yes, I do worry about lesson plans for the week, the piles of markings on my table (but I actually completed 3 piles on Friday! Clap clap!) ..I do worry about those monkeys in school, how they are coping, my form class etc etc  ... I don't have a choice, do I?  work review tomorrow. Hope it'll be short and sweet. Like me. hah.   To all my friends starting their NIE courses tomorrow : All the best in your new journey. Enjoy NIE life while it lasts ( esp those in PGDE! slack while you can ... )   Good night all. Sweet dreams .

      he's finally feeling better. For the first time in 4 days, he sounded normal on the phone. Glad that he's much better. Got me real worried. Hopefully, he is really getting better and it is not just a false alarm.Anyway, he sent me a really sweet sms. It shall remain a secret  *grin wide wide*  Workshop yesterday was actually quite fun. Could also be because I had great team members. Yeah! Go Math Dept!  A few people asked me about my dad...yeah, words do get around. I rarely express my emotions in public but I couldn't help feeling sad when telling them about what happened. Maybe I just need a good cry. But Laalaa cries??? see lah how... :-)  I'm feeling sick. On top of my irritating headaches. my throat feels sore and I've been sniffing ...oh no... Well, still must do work. My work review is tomorrow. Better complete it soon. And lesson planning for the week... AAAAAARAGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!

      His fever has gone up yet again... 39.2 degrees. Just when we thought it was going down. Sigh, I'm pretty worried. He went to see the doctor again , was given a new set of medicine and told to wait till MOnday. I'm just afraid it's some kind of infection. Coz it doesn't seem to be the usual kind of fever. This , plus my dad's situation , has somehow affected me. just wasn't enthusiastic at work just now...I practically went into the classes, did what I had to do... and went out. Can't even remember how my lunch tasted.   I & E workshop tomorrow... NOt even spared on Saturdays. Tuition. then markings yet again. Is this how life's going to be like always? It's not that bad actually, but i just feel lousy today. Shucks.

      Testing testing...&nbsp; it's finally up . I have always wondered what it is like to have an online diary. Pretty busy at work at the moment but decided to give it a shot. Be Patient with me... I'm new to this and honestly, am very blur about this whole blogging thingy.   What do people normally write for their first entry?&nbsp;intro?&nbsp;but that's so lame... but what the heck? so here goes.... I'm 23 , going on 24... had always been the youngest in class during my sch days as my birthday is in the 2nd half of Dec....yups, December baby. A Capricorn...known for its stubborness. So yes, I am stubborn or rather, a determined and strong-willed person ... Don't like to be forced into doing things which I can't rationalize. But I can be nice to you... in fact,I think I'm quite a nice person  lah  :-) I won't say much about myself.... I'll let people find out for themselves....   Wish I can go on writing.... It seems to get easier ...hehe ... But I have tons of marking to do ... better ciao now.... oh yes, I love  Pink !    &nbsp;

      The production.....  it was , overall,  good. The Students were really putting up their best and it was apparent how much passion they put into their performance. My colleague and I kept exchanging comments but we both agreed it was well put together. Congrats to my fren who was the scriptwriter and basically the one in charge of the whole thing...GOod job!  Had a long talk at the Padang while enjoying the night scenery. I don't think I've ever done that ...or mebe not for a long long time...must ask the BF to spare me more time....:-)  Life is complicated and always full of activities...we should always try to stop and smell the roses...talking about flowers, I like the sunflowers ( ? ) yesterday...

Things to look up for: tomorrow's musical at VT (it's a school's production). And the weekend.Yippee.

      It has finally happened...  All these while, I've been wondering what will happen if i knock into one of the vehicles on the road as I am always feeling sleepy....Just now on the way home ard 10pm, I kissed the bumper of a taxi . I was sleepy and having a headache. I just blacked out ...didn't even know the taxi was in front of me until I felt the vibration...panic skejap....luckily the driver wasn't the obnoxious kind...meeting up with him tmrw to settle stuffs. Sigh ..there goes my miserable money ...  But it was great meeting up with the girls . We had cakes and coffee at TCC at Orchard Cineleisure...the crab sandwich looked so appetising .If only it was halal....Sheng really liked the collage.She was teary when she saw it ..he he...we made her recall the story behind every single picture on the collage. Shall post the photos up soon...

      wat a morning...  Good morning to all.... It's not a brand new year or month or week...it's simply a brand new day for me! and you too. but it wasn't a very a good morning though. I had to wake up at 6 ( mind you, I only managed to fall asleep around 4am) to send my daddy to hospital. Reached there at 7:30...didn't know where to go after that since my tuition only starts at 9:15.. wanted to drop by east coast but decided against it. East coast is splendid for its serenity and tranquility ...but it is also a place for you think of any problems you have, and I don't want to think of them at all.. I waana lead a problem-free life...hahaha....so idealistic ...but just for now, I want to be care free ! yahoo......So here I am in school...it's like a ghost town. I'm the only one in the staff room....  Today's gonna be a busy day. I promised my students that I'll meet them for a game of pool but I'm not sure if I can spare the time... smack myself for making that promise! And Aly and I have still not decided where to bring sheng for her post-birthday lunch. We're not entirely rich at the moment...in fact, we are very broke, after buying the present.Maybe we'll just settle for pizza hut.. sigh...so much for keeping things simple. :P ....must remember to bring my nikon later..then can take pics many many!  I miss my best fren...the last time I saw her was when we went for manicure/pedicure together. She used to be the place where I pour out my 'sorrows' ..but now I have to resort to this blogging thingy since she's so busy and all... I think I should make a date with her soon.  JUst listened to the duet by Clay and Kimberly...they have such strong vocals esp Clay. Love him...    Never even thought to cry When I heard you say good-bye Never said where you were going There's no laughter in the air Only silence everywhere And so much left unspoken Since you've been gone I haven't been the same I wish that I could see Who's to blame          Without you, where do I belong? Without you, how can I go on? No love but yours will ever do Tell me how am I supposed to live my life without you          Was I lost in you and me To the point I couldn't see That what we had was dying Now it's all that I can do To see photographs of you And stop myself from cryin' I should learn to live without your love Got so many memories, but it's not enough          Without you, where do I belong? Without you, how can I go on? No love but yours will ever do Tell me how am I supposed to live my life without you?          feel helpless and oh so all alone Ooh Like I've never felt before You made me feel alive     But I don't remember what it's like anymore    Hmmm.... I really wish I had more time yesterday. but we can't turn back the clock...life goes on baby...rollerblading in the evening , i hope. Need to sweat it out. I shall call him.

      My sec sch cikgu told me before ...we must have  faith  in the decision we make. I made my decision. I should stick by it, come what may. The same goes out to all of you out there. Once you've made up my mind, do not give in to temptations that may just spoil your plans.  Life is and will always be a mystery.  On a lighter note, we're having national celebration in school. I want to go rollerblading but there's a national day lunch-cum-movie screening. SIgh sigh... I'm supposed to help him send his car for servicing. tuition. then dinner with fren.how? dada's chemo appt is 8 tomorrow morning!!!!  I reckon I'll  be dead beat tmrw night.  oh...there goes my phone! yeah... It's him....ciao all!

      DOn't know why I felt uneasy when I woke up this morning. Then I couldn't find the right clothes for today. Couldn't find my answer sheet for one of the sec 3's worksheet. Computer couldn't be switched on and I badly need a file from the hard disk. Confused.  Reached school slightly earlier.     Read something   . Maybe that's the reason for my subconscious uneasiness? I don't know.  I don't want to know anything.  Still uneasy.  But happy that things are working out for those whom I care for.

      Goodness...it's my buddy's birthday in   2   days and I haven't bought her anything.  But tell me, what do you buy a girl who has practially everything, earns more than $3k a month and that money is absolutely all to herself? I've realised that the standard of our birthday gifts just keeps getting higher and higher each year....at the rate we are going, I'll disappear in a few years' time and pretend I never know her.....:) but seriously, I'm at a dead end. Bought her a dkny watch last yr, digital camera the year before.... she just bought a new mobile phone so that's out...and it's too late to make anything....AAAAAarrrrrghhhhhghhhhhh! I welcome suggestions ...  I miss her though.....can't wait to see her and catch up on all the missing pieces of life....I think I'll call her tomorrow. And yes, I still welcome suggestions for the pressies....

      I've always been nice to people. Some may irritate me but I always try to put it aside. Never in my intentions have I ever wanted to hurt anyone. So, it sucks to know I've caused hurt to some people. Unintentionally. Never ever in my dreams. Feeling  sucky .Wish I can do something .  He wanted to spend more time with me after Johor trip. I went up to my house to take something to pass to him...saw my dearest Ainul there. Brought her down to his car together coz she wanted to see him ... He was glad to see her but he wanted to spend some time alone together actually... Another person I hurt. Oh ... what a day...  my cousin's so tall now... baru eight yrs old... haha...let me rephrase...I'm the less tall one...:)
