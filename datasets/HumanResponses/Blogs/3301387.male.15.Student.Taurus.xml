      Sk8boarding sometimes makes u go insane. And I mean realllllllly insane. It gets real fucked sometimes. I mean like u can't land tricks , u get fustrated and stuff. Fuck i mean I cleared 9 steps and i used to be sooo good at stairs and just yesterday i was struggling with four. OMFG. Oh my fuckin god. Tat makes me think of this guy by the name of Lim Yong Zheng. Fucking says 'oh my wife' Sounds wierd to the ears. Jux yesterday when i was sk8in with Lim and elyas at commonwealth stairs at bout 8. This fuckin fog started to form. Really freaked me and elyas Out man. Elyas was like "DUDE what the fuck was that??" I was like  Let's get the fuck outta here. And lim was like 'Go's prescence is here, he has blessed us' and blah blah blah yadayadayada. so we were ok ok let's jux get the fuck away then we went to the bus stop.  Like the bus stop was like across the street and the only way across was the overhead. We took it and at the top there was this shit that stumped me. It was just this huge tall extremely white wall. It was sooo bloody fuckin wierd looking.  and yea anyways we went to the bus stop then we started rapping and singing and stuff. I told lim to tell me when 105 came but he made me miss it. Damn that dumb fuck. oh well, then we started rapping again and we were smokin and there was so nobody. Occasionally some cars went past but we were alone and BOY WE WERE LOUD and RAWkking... Their bus came, they took 123 to somerset and my bus was just behind, 105. Good deal, good day. It was great. Can hardly wait for Friday. Oh...and the struggling with 4 steps? I realised it was just my mind. After we had this long break and rapping and chatting and laughin bout life and smoking. Went back, had fun. 100% clear every single one. hell of a nosebone ollie. :D Friday friday come come soon. lalalalala.

      [Hi hi hi hi N hi. Good day. lalalala (ahhhh such sweet sound) the fiddler on the fucKin roof. Is that Mr Bentley Frankswell? Indeed it is.     Sup ppl, ya know, there's gotta be a first for everythin. first for this first for that. but if so, i never got first for anything else. i was more rather first from the bottom. N' Here i am on this com playin "love is only a feelin by the darkness" and it just strikes me. millions of things strike me a day. out of these million, just one is enough to change everything that 'everything' would be to you. you wouldn't go about two blocks thinkin in ur head what this kid walkin right past u was thinkin. It would never hit you. Wouldn't it hit you... yea but even if it did what's the use, you can't do anything about it. There are so many things, so many questions being asked, so many truths to be seeked but really, there isn't actually that need.  All i ever wanted to do in my life was to enjoy time. Each second of time that melts into an entity of what we like to call life. It's really better just to not question anything. Cos u can't let it turn, you can't make anything else change, you'd still die one day, you'd still be afraid for the rest of ur life of just one single second of ur life - death. One short moment of pain for a life of Immortality. I think if u could actually see death...it'd be just soo awesome. what if u could see death? what if you could see that exact moment of death takin away what we love so much yet hate. what would it be like? Death... i mean..like wow. ]    That's just one of these many million of thoughts that go round inside my head each day. Millions of em' just like fireflies , like a dragonfly infestation like Spawning. And it goes like 'zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz and ZZZZZZZZZZZ each time it passes my head it goes really loud just like______________________________________BAMPH*     ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Hi, I'm tom.
