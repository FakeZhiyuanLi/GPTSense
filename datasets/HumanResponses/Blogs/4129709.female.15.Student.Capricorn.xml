       ei guys!just wanna share withe you my  ateneo essay .Ü please do a comment about it.thank you.Ü      In a house where its façade could almost be compared to that of Queen Elizabeth’s palace, there lived a girl. She had stayed there from the moment of her birth. And almost half of her life was spent lurking at the backyard or playing with rag dolls inside the big house. The house may appear beautiful to passersby. It may even provoke a sense of envy and jealousy from the people who pass by the house on Navotas. But when you go inside the house, you will see broken windows, broken doors, broken sinks, and a broken family with broken promises. It’s too long a story to tell. But the girl’s parents went on their separate ways carrying with them their own reasons as to why they had to leave and abandon their children behind.  And here comes her auntie to whom she and her siblings were sent to and to whom the big, beautiful and almost picturesque house belongs to. Her auntie, swirling behind her head the dreams and hopes she has for her nieces and nephews, gave them the quality of education they needed, fed them with what they need, gave them clothes to wear, and gave them two things that their parents weren’t able to give them: time and love. Still oblivious of the reasons why her parents had had to leave them behind, she grew up perfectly well with questions she never found the answers to.  After she had her grade school graduation, her auntie transferred her to an all-girls’ school, St. Scholastica’s College, Manila. Her auntie chose this school both because of the reputation it has gained for having a good quality education and because of the outreach exposure trips St. Scho has to offer that would help this girl to be more independent. She found gaiety in her first year at St. Scho until her sophomore year when an incident she never expected to happen occurred… a tragedy that she could never forget for the rest of her life.  It was the time when her mother disowned her and her siblings. The words that came out from her mother’s mouth made her so weak that she couldn’t utter a single word in front of her mom. She felt the world breaking apart right in front of her eyes.  But despite everything she’s been through, she is determined to continue her bubbly outlook towards life. Still, she cannot remove the memory of the day when her mother came up to her and told her she isn’t hers anymore. Forgetting is hard and she knows that. But she won’t let that one incident in her life ruin who she is known for today. At school, she is perceived as a very fun-loving person, never forgetting to smile even in the most troubled times of her life. And she’s not about to let anything ruin her optimistic perception towards life. Her life may seem happy, but beneath those laughter lies the real her, almost drowning in hatred. Things aren’t always what they seem to be. She talks a lot even in the most boring of days…all because she finds gaiety in living.  And the girl, whom everybody admires because of the ecstasy she found in living, was me.  I learned to accept the mistakes that my mother has committed. I am humane, and so is she. She deserves to be forgiven and to be loved. And I, on the other hand, deserve to be happy. And I can only be happy when I learn to let go of the hatred and bitterness I have for my mother.  I needed to think about the things I’ve done in my life, including the incidents that transpired between me and my mom. And so I found out about the outreach activities St. Scho has to offer. And I sought refuge in the company of kids in Pandacan. I received the kind of love I needed in the company of people in Pandacan. And for once in my life, I felt how it is to be accepted fully without hearing any judgment. And in Pandacan, I found what I have been longing to find; I found myself and the one thing that I need to survive this “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” life; I found God.
