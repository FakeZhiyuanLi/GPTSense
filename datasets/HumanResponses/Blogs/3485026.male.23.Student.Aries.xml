      Hoping to find purpose, find direction, To end the wandering, destroy the void, Why must they always be here, never leaving, How can I escape from this place, boundaries.  Boundaries set by me, restricted by same, Walls enclosing, thirsty in a desert of illusion, Hungry in a sea of emptiness, Lost inside a map.  Needing something, but I know not what, Capture by meaningless, drowned by routine, Impatience persists, calculated to perpetuate, Hollowness, and fear.  Doubt creeping back into the mind, Worth decreasing systematically, Shadow clouding my soul, Poisoning my heart.  Progress past forgotten, Reversion to the horizon With darkness in the forecast, And a rut in the mud.  How do I escape… How do I defeat… How do I move… How do I see light… How do I avoid past mistakes… How do I beat setback… How do I step forward… How do I wander aimlessly again… How do I handle torture… How do I fight demons… How do I survive….  Do I survive?

      I have been thinking a lot so far this summer, just about my life in general, law school, and its direction.  Law school has started to become a double edged sword in my life.  I love the intellectual challenge, the order that the law can potentially bring to things, and the opportunity it can give.  At the same time, law school seems very dark.  Most people are pessimistic and distrusting concerning human nature.  Sometimes, the nature of the very inquiries we are being trained to make assumes that people are inherently bad, and  that when someone acts in an honorable and noble way, that it is the exception.  Maybe this is true of all of society, but I know that the concept is overwhelmingly prevalent at law school.  Anyway, I am not sure where I am going with this, it just something that has occupied some of my thinking lately.  In addition, with Jackie graduating from SJC, she is now 2 to 2 1/2 hours away...and with her working two jobs, me in classes, gas prices being what they are, just seems like a recipe for a very stressful summer.  The worse is that the future is so open ended with her job...depending on if and where she finds a teaching job, the next year before our marriage could end being very trying...trying not on the relationship, just on each of us individually.  When she comes to visit, I am able to deal with the stress of classes better, I laugh more, I live more, and in general and a much happier person.  Being here by myself leaves me alone with my thoughts too much, and I don't like where my mind goes sometimes.  Overall, depressing thoughts have started to creep back into my life, and I hate that they have, especially when I know that there is so much good present in my life.  Seems like things pile on... the uncertainty concerning the next year and beyond, the dissatisfaction with the atmosphere of law school, the living alone, hardly seeing Jackie or my other friends, and questioning what I should be doing with my life...  Part of my overall frustration with things I know is traceable to the fact that I don't have a job this summer and I'm stuck taking summer classes.  I know that the classes are better than doing nothing and working a typical summer job, but oddly enough, I miss working...I miss the feeling of doing something productive and seeing the results of it, a weird advantage to those summer jobs.  My life has turned into a routine of books...which wouldn't be all that bad if I were choosing the books, and maybe doing some writing, instead of reading law case books and just having to attempt to hold onto all the information...  At this point, I just hit on something..."maybe doing some writing."  I have always held that in the back of my mind, that I would love to write.  Problems are that I do not possess good technical writing skills, and I can never decide on a direction, so anything I start to write seems to be completely sporadic, much like this and other journal entries.  Sometimes I think that writing might be a solution for me, something that would give more purpose than just the law school, but something the law school could help me with.  Still, it always comes back to the issue of what would I write about, what topic or group of topics would interest me sufficiently to put the time and effort into writing something substantial.  I think about writing about some philosophical ideas, but I am to indecisive about those topics, and not sure if I can really discuss them at a great depth.  I then think about writing about religion, and specifically my experiences with it and how I came to discover God again, and the general relations between the religions that I see, but who is interested in what I think...in reality, the only aspect concerning religion that I feel a lot of passion about is how people tend to compartmentalize their life, and leave religion, God, and so forth out of their day to day routines...but I don't think I could write for very long on that, which would then turn into an essay and nothing substantive, and I'v written essays, I have this desire to write something more substantial, something that is thoroughly in depth on a subject...and then I wonder if I have the patience to actually write something that is substantial and thorough.  Oh well, I guess I have exhuasted some of my thoughts for now...I will leave myself with a message from the Dalai Lama, words of wisdom...  "It seems that often when problems arise, our outlook becomes narrow.  All of our attention may be focused on worrying about the problem, and we may have a sense that we're the only one that is going through such difficulties,  This can lead to a kind of self-absorption that can me the problem seem very intense.  When this happens, I think that seeing things from a wider perspective can definitely help - realizing, for instance, that there are many other people who have gone through similar experiences, and even worse experiences.  This practice of shifting perspective can even be helpful in certain illnesses or when in pain.  At the time the pain arises it is of course often very difficult, at that moment, to do formal meditation practices to calm the mind.  But if you can make comparisons, view your situation from a different perspective, somehow something happens.  If you only look at that one event, then it appears bigger and bigger.  If you focus too closely, too intensely, on a problem when it occurs, it appears uncontrollable.  But if you compare that event with some other greater event, look at the same problem from a distance, then it appears smaller and less overwhelming."  Random quote "Worry is the activity of the mind which does not understand it connection with Me" - God

      Didn't know what to put for the title, just something to represent how I am thinking.  I have finals next week and then the summer session will be over, which I have very glad about.  I have noticed how tired I am this last week, and how much I really need a break from law school, just a chance to recooperate my focus and ethic.  I am starting to experience with some user friendly linux alternatives to windows...in part due to my frustration in dealing with Microsoft products and in part to support the ideal of capitalism by lending support to the competitor.  I have even started using a different word processor to get away from the autoformatting that Microsoft Word always does and ends up annoying me in the process.  Anyway, I have also noticed that the urging to write something that I mentioned a few weeks ago has not gone away, but I still have no idea as to what and how and so forth...but maybe, after finals, something will come to me and I can start writing something.  On to some thoughts...  I had a discussion last night that made me think hard about being alone/loneliness and similar states.  Specifically, I am thinking about what distinguishes the two states.  I mean, one can be alone without being lonely, but what makes it that way.  As I am writing this, I think that I need to think a little more in order to make my thoughts a little more coherent.  I remember reading a book a few years back called "Solitude" and am thinking of going back to that book to reflect more on my thinking.  Anyway, I will get back to this...

      I have been noticing as of late that I have had a hard time paying attention in my summer classes, not sure if it is because it is the summer, or if I am just tired from the previous year.  But the class I am in now, The Legal Process, is by far the most bring class I have ever taken.  The reading is horrendous, like reading a Math textbook where it gives you the problems then the answer right after it, so there is no thinking involved, like a book is lecturing.  Then to make matters worse, in class we rarely cover anything that is not in the book, so we just end up repeating the textbook.  The only time we leave the text is when the professor points us to some article or review that he is written and what his thesis is.  And, if you have a question, you will never get called on.  Last class, a guy had his hand up for 20 minutes, the professor looked right at him while he was lecturing, and kept going and never stopped to see what the question was.  This summer I have gained experience with two new professors at the school, and I am not impressed with either, I actually rearranged my schedule for the fall and spring so I could avoid taking them.  My professors during my first year were all really good at teaching, with mixing lecture and questions, and did an excellent job in relating the relevant material.  These two professors this summer lack all of those characteristics.  Anyway, enough of the complaining.  Lately, I was surfing randomly over the web and came upon information concerning the Baha'i faith.  I was really fascinated by what I read and learned, and found that much of what they believe relates to things I have thought about in the past.  I especially liked the concept of continual revelation through the "manifestations" of all of the major religions.  I also liked the concept of breaking down the barriers between people and working towards actual unity in the world and justice for every human being.  They also provided this free download of a library that has roughly 1,000 texts from various religions.  The majority of the texts are from the Baha'i faith, but there was literature from Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and more, and it is an awesome tool to research different concepts of the religions and be able to quickly compare them to each other.  I plan on doing so more research into the Baha'i faith, probably not to adoption, but probably similar to my relation to Buddhism, where I read the literature and embrace the ideas within the framework of my own spirituality and beliefs.  In the spirit of my inquiry into the Baha'i faith, here is a short excerpt from a Compilation concerning Scholarship within the Baha'i faith:  "Knowledge is one of the wondrous gifts of God.  It is incumbent upon everyone to acquire it.  Such arts and material means as are now manifest have been achieved by virtue of His knowledge and wisdon which have been revealed in Epistles and Tablets through His Most Exalted Pen - a Pen out of whose treasury pearls of wisdom and utterance and the arts and crafts of the world are brought to light. Knowledge is as wings to man's life, and a ladder for his ascent.  Its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone.  The knowledge of such sciences, however, should be acquired as can profit the peoples of the earth, and not those which begin with words and end with words.  Great indeed is the claim of scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world...In truth, knowledge is a veritable treasure for man, and a source of glory, or bounty, of joy, of exaltation, of cheer and gladness unto him."

      It is our mind that creates this world  I found this quote from The Buddha while I was looking for some are online today, and I really like it.  It puts into words very accurately and concisely how important I believe perspective is.  I think it is unfortunate that at times we hear the cliché about how important attitude is that whenever we hear it we quickly dismiss it by stating that “we know” and “I’ve heard that.”  And I do mean dismiss…I am not sure we really realize how significant our perspective is.  From any point of view, philosophical, skepticism, religious, pragmatism, cynicism, and so forth all recognize the importance of perspective, while creating the interesting situation of being a perspective themselves, talking about the importance of perspective.  But here is one short and quick argument for the absolute superiority of perspective.  Philosophically speaking, nothing in this world, including the world, can be proven to exist.  Descartes’ famous “I think therefore I am” is actually inadequate to prove one’s existence, as it assumes being before the being thinks when the statement is deconstructed.  The best that can be said is that there I doubt, and doubt implies a doubter, but there is no guarantee that the doubt is “your” doubt.  Science, which many people prove to, is based on a reasoning method known as induction.  Deductive arguments proves something is true if the premises are true.  Induction, which is science, makes it so that if the premises are true, the conclusion is only probably true.  This means that all of the scientific “truths” of our world…i.e. gravity, light, sound, and the discoveries of biology, chemistry, and physics, and so forth, since they are all based on our senses and our interpretation of our senses, is induction, and therefore gravity, although our experience, which may not really be our own remember, tells us that it is always true.  However, the point is that technically and logically speaking, all scientific truths are only probably true. This argument is only offered to show that since so much of our everyday world is unknown, and consequently very much out of out control in our everyday actions, that how we view the world may be the one aspect of our existence that we truly can exercise complete control over.  Everything else, our knowledge, our experience, and our science are all, to some extent, outside of our control.  Whereas, our perspective, while it can be influenced by external forces such as family, society, and circumstance, is something that can be determined independently.  When determining our perspective, we can consider these factors and reject our accept them, their influence, in an ultimate sense, is dependent on us. This is very elementary at this point, but just something that I was thinking about…possibly the beginnings of something more involved and detailed.  Just trying to show how important perspective is and how it may be the only thing that we can really control, and how we should have more respect for it.

      Well, I am having some serious motivational problems right now.  The case comment for the law review competition is due on Friday, and I haven't done anything for it.  Part of me is starting not to care about it...all you hear about is how hard it is and how time consuming it becomes.  But with my grades being a bit lower than I would like, I feel like I have to at least try and make it, even though in the back of my head I am pretty sure that there is no way in hell that I am going to make Law Review.  Considering that I am going to spend two days on it, and I will need to either pull an all nighter tonight, tomorrow night, or Thursday night, and I am pretty tired right now, so tonight is probably not going to happen.  This most likely means that I will have to stay up for both tomorrow and Thursday night, which will make my trip to Indy on Friday morning interesting...but at least all I have to do when I get back is crash and sleep for a day and half before helping Justin load some stuff and head over to Fort Wayne to see Jackie.  Anyway, I guess that is about it for now, I think I will head to bed early tonight to try and get some good sleep so I can be as productive as possible tomorrow working on the case comment...hopefully I can at least get six pages of it done, which would be half of the maximum were are allowed.  Oh well, enough for now, off to bed...zzzzzzzzzzzz

      little bit hungry right now, so now sure how long this will be.  Thinking about the word hungry, outside of the physical sense, I wonder what I am hungry for in life.  This past weekend Jackie and I went camping with my familiy and I met my (step)nephew for the first time and was able to spend some time with him.  It made me realize more than before how much I want a kid, and more to the point, how much I want the experience of being a father.  I get doses of solitude in my daily life, I get little doses of fellowship when I talk to friends online, be it email or instant messenging.  I get large doses of fellowship whenever I am able to talk to a friend on the phone or meet up and have dinner, hang out, and so forth with one or a group of friends.  I get doses of love whenever I talk to Jackie, and almost always become overwhelmed with it when we can just be with each other.  I get doses of the divine when I pray, meditate, and take in the wonder of the world around me.  I get all of this, yet I still feel a yearning...I know some of it is a spiritual yearning, to have a deeper understanding and relationship with the Divine, but after the past weekend, I feel that some of it is also a yearning to be a father.  Just a matter of being patient I guess....    I have been thinking more and more lately about the spiritual yearning/emptiness/hunger that I have been feeling.  It never seems to predominant me, but it seems like it is always just there, nagging at me for some reason.  I have gone to church in the last few weeks, but I have never been able to put myself forward and worship like that...just not me.  At SJC, I got involved with retreats and Faith Group and I think that really was my form of worship, and enabled me to really connect with God more so than ever before.  This last year at law school, I got involved with the Christian Legal Society and the Bible Study, and I think that came close to do the same thing, closer to the kind of worship that I think I am able to best do and form the best relationship with God.  More and more, I realize that whatever church Jackie and I end up attending in the future, I need to be looking for one that has a lot more than just the Sunday worship, one with small informal gatherings of people dicussing faith, God, life, and experiencing fellowship in that way.  Anyway, like I said at the very beginning, getting hungry so I am going to make some dinner...

        A lot has been going on since I last wrote in here.   First and most importantly, Jackie moved to Elkhart about two weeks ago.  Consequently, most of my time has been spent there to attempt to help her adjust to living on her own...I know that she does not like it at all.  I am just hoping that it becomes like last year at SJC was, where she was able to get so busy she didn't have the down time to think about being alone.  Otherwise, she will probably end up being miserable for the next year living there, which will just make the year incredibly stressful for both us.  The good news is that we only have 10 months or so before the wedding and the beginning of our marriage and the end of living apart at great distances.  The experience of living apart has been incredibly difficult, especially after coming from SJC where you saw each other every day and for many hours.  I think it has helped us put things in perspective to better appreciate each other and to be more patient individuals, but despite the possible good things it has been a hard road, and I am looking forward to its end.  In other good news I found out about a week ago that I made law review.  I am very excited about it.  After I turned in my case comment I was pretty doubtful about it...anyway, making it will be a big boost to my law school career, and hopefully help my get a job in the location that I want.  I also bought my books earlier today, always amazes me how expensive they are, makes my book purchases at undergrad look small.  Oh well, I guess education is expensive.  I am looking forward to the beginning of the school year...near the end of summer classes I was completely burned out...but now having a couple weeks of being able to relax and read things of my own picking have helped me get energy again for another go around.  It will be a taxing year...classes being harder, law review, the job hunting process, and I still hope to get more involved with CLS...but I am looking forward to the challenge.   I finally saw Nick on Tuesday night and was able to ask him about being co-best man at my wedding.  My wedding party is now set...and I can't help but think about how blessed I am to have the friends that I do, and to be as close to them as I am.  One thing I have always loved about the group of friends that I am in is the diversity of interests and talents.  When at SJC, we were all involved in some stuff together, but we also were individually involved in other areas, and for the most part, were all studying different disciplines.  Now, post SJC, we all are doing different things, working different type of jobs, some related to our degree, some not, some taking grad classes part time, some full time...I just love being able to be in the large group and talk and realize how many different things that we are doing.  Anyway, can't think of anything else to write about for the moment...guess it's time to make something for dinner...
