      well today i got up at 10 which is really early for me crazy!!!! anyway i got up so early coz i was going to meet jess at 1. When we met up we had to go to my mums work to get my money to go to the cinema but while we were doing this we forgot about the bus times so we missed it whoooooooopps. But when we got on the bus we got to the cinema at about 2.10 and tht was the time garfield started and i knew jess wanted to see tht so i promised her tht we would go see it when i get back. So we decided we would go watch spiderman 2 which we both had already seen, but hey its a gd film in side the cine we this dude sat nxt to us and like laughed at ever single bit of spiderman and we had some kids which were on r other side being really loud. But half way through the film i elbowed jess in the nose which i am really sorry for *big hug* but i explained to her tht i have done loads of nice things for her. Its hard to expect tht im a nice person but i am i gave jess one off my t-shirts in the pouring rain when she was cold, carried her accross puddles,  i walk her home every night and walk a really long way to escape kevs i love u babe, anyway we got the bus back and i walked jess home and i was thinking tht when we were kissing her parents would walk round the corner coz we saw them walk past but they didnt crazy. then i got home and i found my bon jovi cd which i have been looking for, for ages and ages yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey. Jess also left me to decide wat we r doing 2moz big mistake im a brain dead person so who knows wat we will end up doing lmao o well gtg il tell u wat we do 2moz sumthin crazy probley c ya............Jackman..................
