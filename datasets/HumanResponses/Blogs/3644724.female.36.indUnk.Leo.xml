      Catchy title, huh?  Now, I am a Yankee girl, who grew up with the notion that roaches are a sign of a dirty home.  I never in my life saw a roach until I moved South where the climate is more inviting to them.  I do the quarterly pest treatment, and feel pretty confident in my housekeeping.  Unfortunately, I am married to a man who sets out a midnight roach buffet before retiring.  My post dinner cleanup includes washing all dishes, wiping/cloroxing down all surfaces, and vacuuming up all crumbs.  Dog dishes are emptied, garbage taken out, and food is put away.  I usually go to bed before DH is done watching Monster Garage/Pimp My Ride/American Chopper/Overhauled.  I wake up to a living room littered with Little Debbie wrappers or a cereal bowl, and a glass of milk or juice on its side with just a tiny dribble leaking out onto my carpet.  The kitchen counter usually has a trail of crumbs or wrappers/empty boxes that just can't make it those last few inches to the garbage can.  I don't care about the cleaning up after DH, but I don't see any point in hanging a welcome sign on our house to my German, Oriental and American "friends". My husband mocks my paranoia - he grew up in FL where you can probably saddle up a roach and ride it around the house.  Here are MY experiences with them.  1.  I used to work with a young woman of questionable hygiene, who announced to me one day that she had to leave her microwave outside in the sun.  "Why?" I asked thinking it was just one of her quirks.  "Well, it's full of roaches.  I mean, I can see them behind the number pad.  The sun should kill them."  Swallowing my disgust, I asked the obvious, "Why don't you just buy another microwave?"  "Nah, I can still use this one." Note to self:  don't eat anything she brings in to work.  2.  We went on vacation to Myrtle Beach, and around 5 am the first morning I felt something on my cheek.  I thought maybe it was a moth or even a fly, but when I brushed it away, it felt pretty substantial, and I could hear it hit the carpet.  I flipped the light on, and saw that it was indeed a roach - ON MY FACE!  After waking up DH and probably our neighbors on either side of our room, I scrubbed myself down, and called around town to get another hotel (not easy during Bike Week).  I waited until 7 am to go downstairs and cancel the rest of our vacation.  I tried to be discreet to the clerk at the counter, but she kept arguing with me that "That's not a roach.  That's a Palmetto Bug - that's our state bug!"  I've never heard of a state bug - does South Carolina also have state vermin?  Palmetto Bug - a roach with an endorsement - unbelievable.  3.  I have found these critters in my dishwasher, utensil drawer, front porch, back patio, and upstairs hallway.  A sighting - though VERY RARE - sends me into a tizzy that only my sweet bug man, Tim, can soothe.  He assures me that I have no infestation, and that it's just a stray that gets in through crack or opening in the doorways and heads to a water source (hence the dishwasher sighting which now forces me to use the heat dry cycle to nuke any infiltrators).    Truthfully, I really only see these critters outside - where it's to be expected. But I still remain ever vigilant against them crossing my threshold.  As Tim says to me, "You Northern people sure are funny about roaches!"

      Ahhhh...summer vacation.  Time to kick back, relax, and have endless fun with my children - just like the pictures in my latest Parents magazine.  The sun will be shining, our yard perfectly manicured, and my children and I will all be tanned and cute in our coordinated summerwear.  Ahhhh...summer vacation.  It's raining - again.  Our "Simple Set" pool, is leaning - again - and we're looking at our fifth go around at draining/refilling. My two oldest kids are at each other's throats, and I've finally had to implement the "kiss and make up" rule to cut out the squabbling. T-ball has ended, so my contact with other adults will be limited until school starts up again in August.  As for my tan, when I take off my t-shirt at night, it looks as if I'm still wearing one.  No one wants to hear just whining, so here are some of my bright spots:  DS has learned to tie his shoes, DD#2 has learned to walk, and as I type this she is scaling the mountain of books and magazines by my nightstand, and I've taken the first baby steps to pursuing my teaching certification.  Oh, and today, I'm visiting my "Happy Place" - Target!  I love Target, as do most other stay at home moms.  I think once we get discharged from the hospital with that new baby, there's a homing device in those hospital issue receiving blankets that propels us to the red bulls-eye.  When I first became a SAHM, I had to watch costs, so I frequented Wal-Mart.  The upside of Wal-Mart is that you can get EVERYTHING you need - food, clothes, tires, etc.  The downside of Wal-Mart is that it's not as peaceful as Target.  If you're escaping from chaos at home, Wal-Mart is chaos magnified.  It is crowded, noisy, and in need of a good cleaning - not unlike my own home.  Target, however, is an oasis of calm.  The minute you step through the automatic doors you are hit with an icy blast of AC.  It is well lit, not glaring, the floor is actually white, items are in order on racks and shelves, and I have yet to see a mother/father beat their child over a Tonka truck.  This is no exaggeration, I can actually feel my breathing and pulse rate go down when I walk in to the store.    Well, I would love to write more, but Spongebob is almost over, and I need to get ready for my Target outing.

      I've never blogged before - except in my own head.  I hope you'll enjoy, be amused, interested,  and/or agitated by my tales of stay-at-home-martyrdom - I mean motherdom - and various opinions on just about anything .  I'll try and keep it interesting!  More to follow...
