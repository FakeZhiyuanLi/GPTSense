      ps...  I feel like shit.... Elle (my fiancé) had her end-of-vintage party last night and for some reason I couldnt get to sleep without her in the bed next to me so when Elle got in at 6am and I had to get up for work at 7.00am I officially did not go to sleep last night.... awake now for 28 hours.  Im struggling :(

      Last night I went to see Salam Pax, the Baghdad Blogger. What a cool guy he is too... :)  It was for the "Big Book Club" roadshow thingy, where they take around certain authors to speak in citys and rural areas (like where I am). Salam spoke for around 40 minutes then followed with about 20 minutes of questions.... I would have liked to hear more from Salam but most of what he was saying could be found in his blog anyway... which brings me to my question (to myself and anyone else reading my blog... highly unlikely as that may be).  I couldnt help but laugh at all these people buying Salam's book.... why don't they just visit his blog and read it on the net? Maybe Im just a tight arse that doesn't want to part with my hard earned cash! :)  Anyway, Salam's talk was fantastic, and although I couldnt have stood up and asked some questions i chickened out for some unknown reason.... my questions were going to be.   In Iraqi schools under the regime of Hussein, was world history taught in full or watered down to portray things as Saddam wanted them to be seen and also was this the case in any other way of life for the general Iraqi public?  So Salam, if by chance you read this blog, I would love an answer to this question and thank you for a refreshing look at world affairs.  bxx

      Saw this on my travels around the "interweb". This sentence....  "What Ronald S. Burt, a sociologist at the University of Chicago has found, like Stoppard, is that most good ideas are not created out of nothing, but rather creativity comes from being in a "structural/social hole". By studying online social networks (such as Friendster) and large corporations (such as Raytheon), Burt found that more ideas came from groups that had very little to do with one another, but the ideas that were implemented came from groups that knew each other."  seems pretty obviously to me.... of course more "fresh" ideas will come from groups that have had very little to do with each other... because when ones ideas merge with anothers they, I suppose, give birth to something else....we can take our expereinces and opinions use them as a base and build onwards and upwards with others ideas etc....... where was if you are in a group of people you know, all of you will tend to think the same (because having become known each other insists you have discussed ideas and opinions and already gone through this process of building) and no "germination" of ideas occurs....   So, this says to me that in order to be a creative person, one must source out people that are different to us, pick their brains and get rid of them before they stunt our creative throughts unless they too meet new people and bring back to the group more understanding and fresh ideas :)   It reminds me of a Nietzsche quote.... “The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently.”

      and now Ive updated my profile, which I can click on my interests and see who else is interested in the interests i am interested in..... *chuckles*  I click on Zarathustra and it came up with people who liked Neitzche, Heidegger and Satre and all my other favourite brains... :)   this rocks.... now all I have to do is lead an interesting life, well interesting enough to write about anyway :)  bxx

      Well, my blog is now started and I am just another blogger in this crazy old world filling up "cyberspace" with my ridiculous ideas and infernal ravings about nothing.... YAY!  My day has consisted of trying to dodge work.... I know, very naughty of me but hey, sometimes you are over the day before it's even started!
