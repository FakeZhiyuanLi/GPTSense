      Why the hell is it that late at nite is when you're the loneliest? It's gonna 2 in the morn soon and im here sitting at this inferal desk typing here when I should be I don't know out...doing stuff with people...or maybe even just one person.  It's remarkable how at this time of morning/nite the radio is even against me yes Mr. DJ please play the Smiths and drive my depression to greater depths. *sigh* Maybe I should not have drunk tonite too...hmm.

      I love Badly Drawn Boy a great deal and sitting here listening to the hour of the bewilderbeast makes me remember why I love his music soo much. It just expresses so much joy, pain, lose and hope all at the same time, something that not very musicians can do.  On another topic all together this Journal is prob going to get pretty personal from time to time and the reason for that is well this a is a place for me to get out emotions. They may be right or wrong in your eyes but at the time or moment it's what I feel. I do this to get frustration out or even just crazy random thoughts. After all that's what this thing is for right...to just release stuff. So whoever is reading this maybe you can relate, maybe you can't. I just hope that my pain, love, lose and whatever is here helps in some small way. Or maybe makes you see thing's a lil diff. Not only do I write my thoughts here but random things as well like poems, lyrics and even a joke or two. What ever is here I hope it at the very least entertains you.

      Does anyone even remember them? Well anyways their one of my fav bands from the 80's and their back together and with a new album coming out soon. I heard a single from it and wow it's still got that groovey 80's flavor and you have to love that. I love the 80's  with a passion that could ignite a million suns; really I love them that much. Maybe it's cuse I grew up in the 80's and the cartoons kicked more ass back than AND I don't care what you say they did.  Come one how could you not love Thundercats and Silverhawks...man those shows were great, hell even the pacman power hour was fucking great. Oh well enuff with my ramblings. snoogins-

      Well the past few days I've been thinking I really don't know if I'm gonna meet this right kind of girl...I've seen her well something like her before and she always. A: Has a great bf B: Has a bf who's an asshole C: Is a lesbian or finally D: Has no interest or what's to be fucking pals  I'm sorry but I don't want to be you're freakin pal, chum, buddy, or compadre. I'm tired of meeting all the wrong one's and never meeting the right ones...wait I have a met a few right ones's but they fall into one of those catagories up above. How hard is it to met a cute gamer geek girl...it seems very. *sigh*   current music: tahiti 80-1,000 miles

      Been doing a lot of catching up on the going on's at E3 this year mostly that of the seXbox (xbox) cuse we all know it kicks ass. Anyway's say a few interviews and one funny enuff was with blonde hottie jenny mcarthy; who was asked so how can a gamer geek more or less snag a girl like you? Her answer was and im not shitting you was "well i dont think their really gonna get a girl like me umm..i think they should stay more into like their market of like someone who wants to stay up till 3am playing HALO". Than she continues with "I don't see some playmate type gurl going for like some smart geeky type gamer guy". There you have it folks as if I didn't already know this information, so word to the wise is geek guys can't have hot gf's.   Why I don't know ask Jenny maybe she and her playmate friends can school you or something on that. Just found it interesting and wanted to write about that, now back to whatever you were doing before you came here.

      Well blogger has been being an ass lately *groan* a lot's going on. Well I went Friday to my mediation for my lawsuit and wow what a hell of a story her insurances lawyers are trying to pull lemme just say her attorney is the biggest jackass Ive ever met in my life. So I'm gonna have to go to Jury trial they didn't even wanna settle for the 25,000 policy limit on her insurance they are saying it's all my fault and the guy said "Were offering you 7,500 dollars be happy with that, that your even getting anything at all, something is better than nothing and you have nothing" My attorney and the mediator were on my side and well so as it turns out get this crap they have surveillance on me crossing the street with OH my dad and I'm not using my cane, yeah idiots cuse at the time of my depo I gave I was idiots and now I don't have to to all the time. So their saying that I'm the one trying to screw over Gieco and the lady. My attorney and the mediator both said take this shit to a jury trial my attorney believes that a jury will in turn award my damages worth at least 130, 000 dollars seeing as I also have to have future surgery on my leg to get the pins taking out and pain and all that jazz. Now this is a comparative negligence case so say the jury says I'm 35% at fault and her at whatever, 35% is taken from that 130 grand plus the 10 thousand they already paid for bills and than I have to pay my 3,500 in medical that my insurance did not pay. Now this is the thing since they chose not to settle and if my award is more than the 25, 000 that they could have settled for. The court automatically awards me that 25 plus another 25 and from that the attorney gets paid and i only have to pay him like 4,000 for his services so I could end up with say 65-70,000 dollars. Thats if I win and my attorney thinks I really would and so does the mediator and well she even asked her staff so there you go.  I've been sick since Sunday nite with some stomache bug which well sucks ass.   **also anyone who reads this and hey wants to chat or something my aim is darksquall2k8 and my email is thelonegeek2003@yahoo.com**  Also who ever you are thanks for the comments ^_^ email me sometime if you like.  current music: Sunny Day Real Estate- Seven

      DVD collecting is an expensive hobby, but any true movie aficionado will tell you that for the best sound and a quality picture presented in a widescreen format, movies must be viewed in DVD format. For the skeptics who are still clinging to their antique VHS players, I have a few words of advice. When the DVD craze first began to sweep the nation, I too was a skeptic. Why should I abandon the faithful video player for an expensive toy that would be a passing fad.  Then for My birthday one year I got a DVD player. I bought my first DVD for 15$, and ever since then I have been sold. First, DVD provides amazing picture and sound quality that is far superior to VHS. Try watching a DVD sometime and notice the difference if you haven’t already. Most DVDs are also presented in widescreen format, which allows you to see the film as it was intended to be seen instead of having the sides annoyingly chopped off. Some people complain about the “black bars” at the top and bottom of the screen, but those shortly blend in with the TV and will not be noticed. Lastly, DVDs are not a fad like Laserdiscs if you even remember those. DVDs have replaced VHS cassettes and are now the standard video format. In a matter of a few years, VHS tapes will no longer be sold. Not to worry. Building a DVD collection is an enjoyable hobby, and whether you’ve just decided to abandon your old school VHS ways, or if you’ve appreciated the greatness of DVDs for a while, you’ll find these tips on purchasing DVDs without going completely broke quite helpful.  [BUY THEM EARLY]  It’s Friday night, and you and your friends just got out of a movie you can’t stop talking about. It was great! After seeing it another nine times, it unfortunately leaves the theater, and you’ve decided that when it comes out on DVD you want to add it to your collection. For any movie that you have seen in theater and wish to purchase on DVD, it is important to follow these instructions. Buy the DVD the first week it is released! Wal-Mart, Target, and sometimes Best Buy will substantially reduce the price of a DVD the first week it is released. I've come to see that Circuit City is the best for this. I have no idea why stores do this, but I highly recommend you take advantage of it. For some DVDs, this will be the lowest price you can purchase it for months or even years. Most DVDs are released on Tuesdays and will hold their discounted price until Monday. CC will often post DVD release dates on a banner in the DVD section and also an ad in the Sunday paper. Amazon.com is a great resource to find out DVD release dates. If Amazon does not have a date for when a DVD will be released, they will send you an email when they do have a release date. The first-week discount only holds for new releases, so if by chance there is a movie that has previously been released on VHS and is being released on DVD for the first time, the discount will not usually be held.  [SHOP AROUND]  One of the greatest lessons I learned early in my DVD collecting days was to be patient and shop around. Usually CC will have the best prices and their selection is decent. Best Buy has recently lowered their DVD prices to nearly match CC's. Both Best Buyt and CC carry DVDs that the other store does not, and they rotate what DVDs they carry every few months. So, if time allows it, frequently check out both locations. CC, hands down, has the best DVD selection of any store, and their prices are fairly reasonable. For DVDs that cannot be found at Best Buy or Target, CC is the place to go. Some DVDs are particularly hard to find and my advice on finding hard DVDs is to keep shopping, because sometimes these DVDs will pop up in the most random places. One night while browsing around in a Barne’s and Noble Bookstore, I found Disney’s The Rocketeer on DVD. Regrettably, I didn’t have any money at the time, so I didn’t buy, and I have not seen it since. In these cases, I would still recommend having patience. It seems as if almost every DVD comes to either CC or BB at some point, and I’m sure sometime in the near future, even The Rocketeer will once again be available for purchase. In extreme cases, where you must have a certain DVD and cannot find it anywhere, you may have to resort to online shopping. In cases where you may have missed purchasing a movie the week it came out, eventually stores will lower its price, so wait it out.  For certain say anime dvd's a comic or even an online retailer is your best bet, and for imported asian dvd's I suggest yesasia.com. All in all I love DVD's and Hope to have the biggest damn collection I can afford including all my fav 80's movies and enjoy them all again.  Next week I'll explain DVD region coding and why it sucks ass.
