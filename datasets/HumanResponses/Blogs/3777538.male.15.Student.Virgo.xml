      entry 2 - 29th june 2004, weather: threatened to rain but never did  day 2 of my 11th term in RI. boring as usual and descriptions of the lessons conducted are less than necessary.   in the morning while walking to class i met kenneth low (good fortune perhaps, a public lecturing was avoided). as expected he asked of my absence from trainings during the holidays and i did not hesitate to bring out the excuse i have planned. simple but effective, a claim of being overseas covers all of the being missing from CCA and is hard to prove or disprove. as for yesterday i simply kept quiet and to my surprise he told me he was now lazy to keep track of such things. good news indeed!  as part of the very much pointless (we have mindsets cast in mithril) Character Leadership Education (CLE) programme, he gave me an interview and babbled plenty of nonsense which i condensed into one short sentence: come for CCA, it is important. that, is nonsense all the same and so that's that, nothing achieved, nothing changed.  computer elective programme was relaxing and enjoyable as usual. i acquired a gmail account from an invitation from kin wai of red cross and with 1GB of space opened up the possibility of receiving all pr0n in the world without my mailbox overflowing but of course, that is a possibility i will not attempt to turn into reality.  i have withheld my decision to leave track n field temporarily, till perhaps the end of the next long holiday during which i will of course be "overseas" and nowhere near the school. i am therefore excused from attending CCA and rest assured that no effort will be made to do otherwise.   -- "work hard, play hard, die young, leave a nice corpse."

      i have thus decided to start writing a diary. it is unfortunate that this decision took 16 yrs to make, in the process of which many memorable events passed by without being properly documented in writing. it would be better had there been documentations of other sorts, such as photographs, but there are non. therefore the decision was so made because i have come to notice that memory tends to fail me and reminders of some sorts are required to prevent memorable things from slipping into oblivion. reminders of the events of my life, glamourous or ordinary, sad or happy, or whatever would be incarnated here. plans are already made for the days in which i have grown old - i would read these and relive history.  so, entry no. 1 - 28th june 2004. weather: sunny.  omfg. apologies for use of crude words but i simply hate today. along with the 2nd of january 28th of june is a day for sadness. immature as it may seem, the termination of the june holidays is an abhorrent event to me.  as usual, i have missed (yes intentionally) all training sessions during the 4 weeks of well-deserved rest and did almost no homework whatsoever. trouble is heading my way, freedom and happiness comes at a price. at 1.30am as i write this i am planning already the excuse i would give 6 hours or so later to kenneth low (whom i wish was at the top al-queda's person-to-be-caught-and-beheaded list) for the above behaviour.  visited macdonalds in the afternoon. bloody idiot somehow thought that i wanted a plain mcspicy and gave me just that. so i had to make do without the green and white coloured stuff that makes the affair look more healthy than it really is.   slept from 5 to 10pm and thereafter read newspapers and wrote some project report on the experimental procedures of a doomed-to-fail air vortex investigaion, a month overdue too.  the major decision i would have to make soon might be my exit from the track n field team. i simply cannot take its stupid javelin-flinging, time-wasting trainings any longer. i supposed i would become a floating-body (that is a person with no CCA) but who cares? i don't.   my desk has become more of a storage device than a writing surface with the things i put there, and i have not yet conceived the intention to clear it. so right now my homework is still not completed but they will be, eventually. nothing much happnened today, save the girl i saw at mcdonalds. nothing happened there as well except maybe a few exchanges of looks, so there is no need to elaborate.  farewell for now. live long and prosper.

      and we have more jokes, yay!  Man Catches Crocodile&nbsp;   A man was fishing and he caught a crocodile. The crocodile told him, "Please let me go. I'll grant you any wish you desire." The man said, "Okay. I wish my balls could touch the ground." So the crocodile bit his legs off. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Man, I Feel Like A Woman&nbsp;   I'm sitting on this plane, eating my dinner, when all of a sudden the captain comes on the loudspeaker and tells us that the plane is about to crash land into the mountains.     &nbsp;  The next thing I know this woman from the front of the plane jumps up from her seat and starts screaming like a lunatic. "I can't die today! I WON'T die today! I am twenty-seven years old! I have been on countless dates and no one has ever made me feel like a woman! Please, I don't want to die like this! Is there anyone on this airplane that can make me feel like a woman?"     The entire plane went from hysteria to complete silence. Then, from the back of the plane, someone stood up. He was a dark, tall, well-built, handsome man.     "I can make you feel like a woman," was his reply.     He started walking slowly down the isle to the woman, who was now shaking with anticipation. One by one he started unbuttoning his shirt buttons, revealing his rippling stomach muscles. He quickly took his shirt off, slowly reached for her trembling hand, looked in her eyes and said...     "Iron this!"&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp; Door-to-Door Sales Crap&nbsp;   An enthusiastic door-to-door vacuum salesman goes to the first house in his new territory. He knocks, a real mean and tough looking lady opens the door, and before she has a chance to say anything, he runs inside and dumps cow patties all over the carpet.     &nbsp;  He says, "Lady, if this vacuum cleaner don't do wonders cleaning this up, I'll eat every chunk of it." She turns to him with a smirk and says, "You want ketchup on that?" The salesman says, "Why do you ask?"     She says, "We just moved in and we haven't got the electricity turned on yet."    The Wrinkled Nightgown&nbsp;   A man and wife were celebrating their 50-year anniversary, so the man bought his wife a $250 see-through nightgown. Later that night she was getting ready for bed and realized the nightgown was still in the box downstairs. Walking naked through the house, she passed her husband. He said, "My word, for $250 they could've at least ironed it!" &nbsp;&nbsp;  Snowmen and Snowwomen&nbsp;   What's the difference between snowmen and snowwomen? Snowballs! Hahahaahahahaha! &nbsp;&nbsp;  Rabid Dogs are Useful&nbsp;   One fall day Bill was out raking leaves when he noticed a hearse slowly drive by. Following the first hearse was a second hearse, which was followed by a man walking solemnly along, followed by a dog, and then about 200 men walking in single file. Intrigued, Bill went up to the man following the second hearse and asked him who was in the first hearse. “My wife,” the man replied.     “I'm sorry,” said Bill, “what happened to her?”     “My dog bit her and she died.” Bill then asked the man who was in the second hearse. The man replied, “My mother-in-law. My dog bit her and she died as well.”     Bill thought about this for a while. He finally asked the man, “Can I borrow your dog?”  To which the man replied, “Get in line.”&nbsp;&nbsp;   Hair Spray: Can You Dig It?&nbsp;   A little boy and his grandfather are raking leaves in the yard. The little boy sees an earthworm trying to get back into its hole. He says, "Grandpa, I bet I can put that worm back in that hole." The grandfather replies, "I'll bet you five dollars you can't. It's too wiggly and limp to put back in that little hole." The little boy runs into the house and comes back out with a can of hair spray. He sprays the worm until it is straight and stiff as a board. Then he stuffs the worm back into the hole. The grandfather hands the little boy five dollars, grabs the hair spray and runs into the house. Thirty minutes later, the grandfather comes back out and hands the little boy another five dollars. The little boy says, "Grandpa, you already gave me five dollars." The grandfather replies, "I know. That's from your grandma." &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      today we had CLE (charater leadershipe education... *cough* aka *cough* Comepletely pointLess timEwasting). we are supposed to decide on a community service project that our class will engage in to help MINDS (movement for the intellectually disabled of singapore), our adopted charity.  &nbsp;  of course we came up with great ideas, i will tell you of them:  &nbsp;  1. we would design a t-shirt and put them on the MINDS ppl. too simple.&nbsp;so to make it more interesting, we would thereafter place them in the zoo for exhibition. rational: such exhibition would grant any visitor an instant boost in self confidence. it is therefore beneficial to society. rational 2: we can also carry out a comparison between humans and monkeys in the process, benefiting mankind even more by acquiring new knowledge.  &nbsp;  2. we would host&nbsp;Copa Retarda. enough said.  &nbsp;  3. we would stay in MINDS homes and clock CIP hours. our presence alone would be beneficial for wisdom tends to diffuse, and we have more than enough to spare.  &nbsp;  well done my group, you did during CLE exactly what the name says you would (look&nbsp;at the&nbsp;2nd line).  &nbsp;  we are so creative.  &nbsp;

      one week has passed since i last wrote in this collection of recollections. life glides on like a asteroid flying through space - uneventful till its doom, whatever. anyway, i have decided to put down some jokes here, enjoy:  1.A timeless lesson on how Consultants can make a difference for an organisation.   Last week, we took some friends out to a new restaurant, and noticed that the waiter who took our order carried a spoon in his shirt pocket. It seemed a little strange.  When another waiter brought our water and utensils, I noticed he also had a spoon in his shirt pocket. Then I looked around saw that all the staff had spoons in their pockets.   When the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, "Why the spoon?"  "Well," he explained, "the restaurant's owners hired Andersen Consulting to revamp all our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our personnel are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift."  As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare.  "I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now." I was impressed.  And I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's fly. Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter, "Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?"  "Oh, certainly!" Then he lowered his voice. "Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we could save time in toilet. By tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the toilet by 76.39 percent."  "After you get it out, how do you put it back?"                                "Well," he whispered, "I don't know about the others, but I use the spoon."  -- posted on rtsgames.com forums by cwntnts on Jul 7 2004, 07:53 AM    2.here's another one involving protruding body parts: 3 men and a cannibal   three people were shipwrecked and were stranded on an island. Whilst exploring, they run into a native of the island and ask for directions to leave.  The native says:  "I will show you a way off this island if the lengths of all 3 of your penises combined is at least as long as mine. If they are not, then I will eat the 3 of you."  With nothing to lose, they readily agreed. The native reveals his penis, and to the 3 men's suprise, it's 20 inches long!  The first man then proceeds to take off his pants, and whips out a 10-inch penis.  The second man takes of his pants, and he's got a 9-inch penis.  "We're outta here," thought the first 2 men, "there's no way we're not going to be able to match the native's penis length."  The third man takes off his pants...                                 ...and he's got a 1-inch penis.  Stunned, but nevertheless elated that they are able to leave the island, they pull up their pants, and follow the native to a beach where a boat was run up onto the sand.   As they're sitting on the boat, heading home, the first guy says:  "You know, you guys are lucky I've got a 10-inch penis."  The second guy says:  "Yeah, but you guys are also lucky that I've got a 9-inch penis."  The third guy says:  "You guys are lucky I got an erection."  --originally posted in rtsgames.com forums by Snoops on Jul 8 2004, 02:32 AM    more interesting jokes, this time shorter. if you do not understand the first and last, don't attempt to; we need more people like you...   A drunk driver got pulled over by a police woman. She said "anything you say can and will be held against you." The drunk replied "tits."   What did one fat girl say to the other fat girl? Who cares, they're fat.  A girl's legs are her best friends, but even the best of friends must part.   and, i've got a puzzle as well:   This is sort of a logic problem and I'm not sure if someone has posted this before, but it's one of my favorites.  Three of the wisest and most clever men in the kingdom were in a dispute about who was the wisest man in the kingdom. To settle this dispute, they traveled to the king's palace to ask for his decision on the matter. The king thought and then arranged for a mind challenge among the three men to settle the dispute.  The king takes the three men to a chamber and blindfolds them all. He then places a hat on each of their heads.  "Now, I've placed a hat on each of your heads. You may either have a blue hat or a white hat on your head. When I instruct you to remove your blindfolds, your challenge will be to figure out what color hat you are wearing, but you may only look at the other two and you may not remove your hat. The first man to shout out the correct color will be declared the wisest man. If you guess wrong, then you will lose your head, but you can keep the hat. The only hint I will give you is that there are not three white hats here."  When the men took off their blindfolds, they stared and pondered, not wanting to shout out an incorrect answer. After a long time of this stalemate, one of the wise men confidently declared the color of his hat. How did he figure it out?  Now I could tell you exactly what he saw, so that you and the wise man would be on equal footing. But can you figure it out without having to look at all?  This is pure logic, no wordplay or tricks.   -- rtsgames.com forums, Gatekreeper          solution: all three of them are wearing blue hats. If there were two white hats and one blue hat, the person with the blue hat would immediately shout out that he had a blue hat. There was a long pause after the blindfolds were removed, so this is an impossibility.   If a wise man sees one white hat and one blue hat, then he knows that he cannot have a white hat, because then the man with the blue hat would immediately say that he has a blue hat. So then he would know that he would have to have a blue hat, and this wise man would say it. Since nobody said anything for a long time, this situation also would not happen.  Therefore, all the wise men see two blue hats, because all of the hats are blue.   that's all i have, farewell for now.

      the past few days have been sadly uneventful. as much as i would like to practise my writing, there is simply nothing to write about: no vivid fantasies, no falling in love, no catastrophies, no nothing.  even the 'fairy-tale', or greek mythology as the chinese papers call it, of greece becoming european champions is are hardly interesting - well, simply because it's just a football game. even the greatest tales of the greatest games don't do anything, so why should this one? after all, they are but games, playing things. if you would look at the core concept of football - of kicking a round thing to and fro - you will realize that it is truly meaningless. but well, i suppose humans get bored, and they have to do something.    in fact, i can hardly recall what i have done these few days - plenty of gaming surely, but nothing else. it is almost as though a void is present in my memory, and that, creates a strange (unpleasant) sensation, a sensation of emptyness that i once again start to feel. maybe the screw-up lies in me, but i am sure, life is indeed boring and uneventful. many, i believe, agree with me, many more will if they consider carefully; it has even been brought up in parliament. it may be that my young mind grows impatient with routines and seeks adventure, it may be that i do not appreciate peace and tranquility (i would hardly call my current situation that), it may (most likely) be i do not like how time comsuming and mundane school is, but as far as i am concerned, there is a problem. i do not know how to fix that problem, and i am troubled. unfortunately however, whining does not help, not mine, not yours, not anybody's. we just have to carry on, and hope something better comes. blah blah  because of this reason, coupled with my poor memory, 16 years of my life has given me hardly anything to look back on. i started this blog to hopefully remedy the same situation that would occur in the future somewhat. when times are as such that there is nothing to look forward to, not being able to look back is painful. if you would make a metaphor of this situation, it would be like being stranded on an island 3 metres wide, and 3 metres long, with nothing on it but sand and mainland nowhere in sight.   well, times are as such that there is precious little excitement. perhaps that would change, perhaps not, we'll see.

      1st july, thursday, weather: sunny, at least in the afternoon  peaceful sleep would replace useless attendance for school this morning, how wonderful. i did not exactly refuse to wake up in the morning, but rather woke up and told mother that i did not wish to attend school instead. anyway there is no difference. sadly i cannot repeat this one more time for friday (do not think i don't wish to), i have to submit the one-week late holiday homework or receive a score of zero for them. not that i would have been bothered by that in the past, but now with this new "consistent work" policy every little piece of assignment affects one's eventual score, so it is necessary. really stupid, but beyond my control.   however the football match would still be watched, at the expense of sleep. screwed-up lifestyle you may say, but such are the days when a major international football tournament is going on. you should believe me, i am not alone.   obsession? no, just something to fill up the empty space in the list of things to do. schoolwork has long been stroke off that list, so too was "sleep to recharge for school". therefore there is preciously little left, and there is need for addition.  football is a passion, just like my passion for computers and the opposite sex. it tends to take priority in life, and make you sacrifice some things for it. sounds like moonshine? maybe you think i am looking for an excuse; pretending to be passionate about something just so i do not have to sleep or go to school. maybe i am, but i must say this: is life not centred around purposes? what then is wrong with giving it a little more when there is scarcely any to begin with? hm?  actually it doesn't even matter what it really is, because in the end, it would be because i chose to. whatever...  "viva la vita!"

      30th june, wednesday, weather: cannot recall (written one day late).  as usual no account of lessons will be given as they are unnecessary.   the project report i mentioned two days ago proved to be a good piece of work. i have confidence it will form the bulk and core of our entire report. but heck, the project is nonsense nonetheless, fabrication helps only to a limited extent here.   portugal vs holland, 2.45am and i watched every minute of it. by the time every minute was up, it was already 4.30am; it felt as though the sun was going to rise soon. what sleep i can get before waking for school was too inadequate to be of any use. how then to resolve the problem? quite obviously: not wake for school in the first place.
