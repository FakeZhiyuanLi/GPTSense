      Thinking .... ..... .........  Drinking beer and eating Caramello bars.  He was very fond of both at that time. He would melt the chocolate on my lips and lick them off!!! We often rolled around on the floor together.   I used to lay upon him, like he was my bed.  He had a strong body.  Beautiful everything!!   I remember one time where he was leaving late and I lay there in bed while he talked to me, I remember trying so hard not to fall asleep while he was sharing his thoughts with me.  He was always full of big plans and wonderful knowledge, he was smart.  This stranger of mine, hmmmm .... I think of the day I met him.  A snow storm, he still made his friends drive a long way to see me thru that.  He wore a brown jacket, and smoked his cigarettes.  He was lovely...  Too precious.... I sit here and reminisce about all these wonderful feelings he bought into my life, yet I still lost him...let him go ... what was I thinking ...

      Look up look down look all around.....  Another day for me lusting and acting like another person to this stranger of mine. This stranger has an empty hole for someone to fill, so I've learned.  If he only knew I could be that filling ...  If he only knew I lusted this badly for him. Lusting for someone is hard .... wanting someone from the past is impossible .. It's undying to me...Taken over half of my thoughts, I need him, want him, oh do I wish he knew... These feeling I have aren't serene, they are bogus to another, it's real and it's an obession of mine.  Can't help that Stalking, do I call it that, no, I call it an obession  Despite all this agony of these thoughts of this old stranger, it feels good to know that he needs something like me.... Chances for me are slim, they always are ....  Knowing this man is still out there searching, he will know it's been me all the while ....

      I've been thinking, thinking of this beautiful man that was in my life for only a brief time.  He impacted me, very deep.  He was very tall, towered over my 5'1 self. Beautiful blue eyes that had me wrapped around him with one glance These luscious lips that once gave me  sweet kisses, very soft embraces that I remember.   He appreciated each touch that he made on me.  He was a great lover, too great for my own needs.  I've been lusting for him for quiet sometime.  If I only had one more night with him, just one, I want him to show me what I've been missing after all these years.  I was foolish to let him slip away, very foolish.   Oh, I am lusting over this stranger I hadn't seen in years. I would love to leave trails of kisses and gaze into his eyes once again. If only time can fly back, I would be in his arms again feeling his hands caress me.  Passionate he was.  Oh I miss that man.....

      Yes, it's been awhile.  While my thoughts are still fixated upon this beautiful man, I have yet to concluded that he would like to see me again.  This will bring me back to the lusting faze, wanting and craving him like I used too.   It's very strange that our encounter was only for that brief time, only that day.  I'm lost .... lost in this corrupted mind of mine ....  What more could I want then a tasty man?

       So I've gotten to the point where I'm lusting for him every day ... I want to come out and tell him this, I want it to be known to him that I want him in every way. It drives me nuts that he's online almost as much as I am and I don't say anything to him. I need to come out of my shell to him and tell him that he is beautiful, his lips, his eyes, his height, his personality, and everything else that makes him .... Things make it so difficult to do so because the situation that I am in. Like I said before, I just want to be in his life in some form, rather it be just fucking or friends. My feelings will grow toward him and I am afraid of that .. To me I can't help my feelings so this little lusting thing will probably turn into something much more eventually. I can prevent this and not talk to him, I mean I did go with out 6 years with out speaking to him so I guess it wouldn't matter much... There is just something about him that I am clinging too ... It makes me sad to feel this way .... He brings butterflies in my stomach, I haven't felt that feeling in so long. When I was with him those few times, it felt like nothing changed, it felt so right to be with him, I was comfortable with him. Unlike now where I am .... I don't know what I'm going to do .... I always place myself in these situations ....    God, he smelt so damn good. I can't believe that he leaned over and kissed me ... I was trying to distance myself sitting in another chair but he wanted me to sit next to him, I told him that I didn't think he wanted me too .... I wish I did go down on him that night. God, I'm kicking myself in the ass for that .... Hopefully, it'd be soon that I get to do that for him again .... =)   He's so fucking hott and he knows it ..... Such a tease to me ....       Now I'm getting into the mushy faze of this, listening to songs that remind me of him .... It's sicking to me ..... If he only knew .....

       I just remembered, that time at the market snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart And rode down, isle 5 you looked behind you to smile back at me crashed into a rack full of magazines they asked us if we could leave.    Can't remember, what went wrong last September thiugh i'm sure that you'd remind me, if you had to Our love was, comfortable and so broken in    I sleep with this new girl i'm still getting used to my friends all approve, say she's gonna be good for you they throw me, high fives She says the bible is all that she reads and prefers that I not use profanity your mouth was, so dirty    Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy but you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane Our love was, comfortable and so broken in she's perfect, so flawless or so they say, say    She thinks I can't see the smile that she's fakin' and poses for pictures that are being taken I loved you grey sweat pants, no makeup, so perfect     Our love was, comfortable and so broken in she's perfect, so flawless I'm not impressed, I want you back.

       Finally, finally after almost 2 months of missing him, he called me over tonight... Yes, I saw him again!!! Just for a bit but that's all I need. He planted a few nice kisses upon me.. Very nice, what an innocent morning this was with him, although he was pushing the idea of some sucking action. I declined, too tired for that .... I gave him a rain check and hopefully will pay him back for the decline one of these days. It's funny, I was just thinking of him earlier tonight (yes, I think of him often but he has slipped my mind a few times recently) ....   =) My morning was made, he smelled very gooood and kissed oh so sexy .....       Till the next day we meet again my stranger ....   Lust is a powerful thing that corrupts one mind ... Drives me insane sometimes ....
