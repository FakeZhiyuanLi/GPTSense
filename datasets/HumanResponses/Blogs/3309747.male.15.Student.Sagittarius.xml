      Asshole: The Game of Chance    In this essay I intend to prove that the card game Asshole is indeed a game of chance and requires little skill. The only upper-hand you can get is if you are Pres. or Vice Pres. in which you have much better cards than your opponents.  The Start: The player with the 4 of Spades goes first, a 17-25% chance of getting it, so theoretically, that player should have a 17-25% chance plus the probability of them winning the game (a 17-25% chance) of winning Pres. since the first to play is more likely to be the first out (in a non-Pres./Vice Pres. game). Which means that the 4 of Spades could possibly be the best card you can have. Pair it up with other 4’s (looking at stats below, there is a likely chance you will in a 4 player game) then your chances of winning are improved. But any asshole player can tell you otherwise. The player with the 4 of Spades does not have a 34-50% chance of winning, so what are the other factors? Certainly it is not skill.  The Trump Cards   In this essay, 2, 3, and Joker cards will be known as trump cards since they do not require the same number of cards as the previous card(s).    In a game of 4 players: The chance of getting a Joker- 50% (25% for pairs) The chance of getting a 3- 100%  The chance of getting a 2- 100%  In a game of 5 players:  The chance of getting a Joker- 40% (20% for pairs) The chance of getting a 3- 80% The chance of getting a 2- 80%  In a game of 6 players:  The chance of getting a Joker- 33.2% (8.3% for pairs) The chance of getting a 3- 66.4% The chance of getting a 2- 66.4%   Looking at the statistics (remember, these are statistics based on probability, it is not a guarantee that you will get a certain card based on the numbers) above you can see the its is pretty common for a player to get both jokers, almost one out of ten games someone probably will (that is in a game without Pres./Vice Pres.).   In a Pres./Vice Pres. game, the chances of getting both jokers as Pres. are: 4 players: 50%  5 players: 40% 6 players: 16.6%  I can safely say this because if you are Pres., then you receive both your highest and the assholes top cards. So you’re doubling your chances of getting both. It is interesting to note that there is a significant drop in chance of getting both jokers from 5 players to 6.  For Vice Pres., you multiply the initial percent by 1.5. It is obvious that the more trump cards you have, the better your chances are at winning.   Pairs, Triples, and Quadruples (Non-Pres./Vice Pres.) The pair, triple and quadruple sets are one of the most influential aspects of the game. The can determine who wins and who loses.   The chance of getting a pair in your hand (including jokers): 4 player game: 104% (this is because you are dealt 13.5 cards and there are 14 different faces) 5 player game: 77%  6 player game: 64%  The chance of getting a triple in a hand (including jokers): 4 player game: 69.3% 5 player game: 51.3% 6 player game: 43%  The chance of getting a quadruple in a hand (including jokers) 4 player game: 52% 5 player game: 38.5% 6 player game: 32%  According to the data above, the chances of your entire hand being completely pairs (in a 4 player game) is 12%, not a bad stat (5 player=10%, 6 player=8%). And a hand full of pairs is likely to dominate.   Runs Runs, the quick way to get out is to ride the wave and discard along the way. As the game progresses, the chance of a run happening is less and less likely to occur, so your best bet is to get in them at the beginning, which leads me to my next point. The only reason you would not complete (not enter, but complete) a run would be if a player in it was on their last card. Besides that, everyone would want in on a run. So again, it is merely a chance of getting the correct cards and being in the correct position that decide if you are in the run or not. Also, I have seen with my own eyes a player who was asshole get out first simply from runs. Skill could not have been involved.  I was too quick to say the Asshole is purely chance. Some strategy is involved. Some people will risk breaking up a triple or quadruple to set a pair or enter a run. Others choose to wait to play their lower trump cards in fear they will be covered by higher trumps. But for the most part, a player will place their lowest card on top of a card. Another element missing from this game is the bluff. The bluff is really only useful when it is down to the last 2 or 3 players still in. A player can choose to go highest to lowest, or to go lowest to highest judging on what he thinks his opponents carry. Their choice affects their rank dramatically. Still, a bluff is of little use in Asshole.    In conclusion, I have looked at every part of the game and conclude that is the hand you are dealt first is the most important, the second most important factor is the cards your opponent plays and where they are located at the table. “But Cameron,” you ask “anyone could have said that!”. Yes, but I have proved it!

      This is it. My first blog. Hopefully this will last, I don't have much of a commitment to things. Maybe this will be different.   Anyways, I've got some interesting things in my mind, that I'll pour out into this site. First off, if anyone knows how to play the card game Asshole (aka Janitor) then they should check out an article I'm putting up soon. I hope whoever reads this will appreciate my work and not critise it. This blog will also have stuff on books, philosophy, psycology, and just stuff that the average person doesn't do. New ideas, stories on our future, and my opinions on stuff.    BTW, I'm only 15.
