        I thought changing job to a place where I know most of the people would seems perfect but instead ....... I will say - one of the worst decision made.  I never felt anything like this before about my work. I am always being praised for being conscientious and an able employee but now...it seems no one apart from my department people, felt I am up to the work.  I have been here for less than 3 months and I am thinking of quitting. Should I have stayed on in the last place? At least I am being regard as ' important ' there.  The situation now is actually encouraging me to leave this work and proceed with my plan to find work in NZ. I have nothing to look forward here... except being make a scapegoat by the two main people from another dept.  Hrmmn...talking about NZ, I actually plan to migrate there but I need to have a job offer first. After weeks and weeks of job hunting and dozens of mail sent out to the Immigration Consultants, I am now stuck. It seems that I will need to be in NZ itself in order to apply for work. But before I resign from my current job, pack my stuff and leave for NZ -- I will feel more secure if I am able to know whether I will have interviews to attend to, while I am on holiday there. The most, I can take 2 weeks unpaid leave. I would like to know my percentage of getting a job before I leave everything here. It is risky to resign and hop to NZ and come back without a job here. But I think that is how this world works. You got to lose something before you can gain what you wish for. I see myself in a win-lose situation here.  I have no one to talk to, no one to discuss with... Yes, I do have friends but I am worried they will just dampen my spirit. I tried telling to one of my friend which holds a Oz PR. She was saying, by going there...you will be considered a second class citizen. And I can't tell a very close friend of mine...for we are working in the same place and she is very close to the management. I do trust her but I just can't bring myself to discuss it with her.  And this is part of the reason why I have decided to blog. I can just pour my worries all to here.  p/s: I have already bought my air ticket but I have not made up my mind on the return date yet.

        Got up from my nap. Felt nothing better. Not sure whether it was the effect of the medicine, cos my body was still aching and I find it hard to get up. Walked to the dining room half-awake and finished my dinner. Came online and look at other bloggers' blog. And found that the name of my Blog - My Thoughts is kinda common. I mean, not that it is extremely special but I don't expect to see that many people using it.  Should I just change the name of my blog? Hrmmn ... was thinking of My Evil Thoughts. But I have nothing evil to write ... not that I am going to anyway. It will just spoil my image. hehe...  What about 'Thought of the Stone' or Stone's Thoughts? Since zirconia is a type of stone. There is link to me that way. Maybe, 'My Thoughts &amp; Feelings' or 'My Space' . Gee, this is harder than I thought!  Any ideas?

        Hah? Second time posting this! I never thought the title for this post is jinxed! First, my car plate was missing. Then, an hour ago, just noticed that my car wiper was stolen and now, my blog post was missing.

        I spent hours looking at other people's blog - a first for me ... and I find some to be rather interesting. For example, Prison Pete! I never really spend time reading his whole blog but it is really unusual to see someone who is in prison, still have the 'mood' to write. He will be out this November if I am not mistaken. I wonder whether the first thing he is going to do is to sit in front of a PC and start blogging on his own. I wasn't sure what he did that he ended up in prison for I am too tired to read. I am exhausted but I do not want to go to bed yet. From my experience, for I am very good in putting clues together - I will say he hack into some bank account or something that has got to do with computers. Why do I say that? Because he works with computers before he went to prison. What an analyzer I am! haha!

        " Everybody's looking for that something One thing that   makes it all complete You'll find it in the strangest places Places you never knew it could be  Some find it in the face of their children Some find it in their lover's eyes Who can deny the joy it brings When you've found that special thing You're flying without wings         Some find it sharing every morning Some in their solitary lives You'll find it in the words of others A simple line can make you laugh or cry         You'll find it in the deepest friendship The kind you cherish all your life And when you know how much that means You've found that special thing You're flying without wings  So, impossible as they may seem You've got to fight for every dream Cos who's to know which one you let go Would have made you complete"      Taken from Westlife - Flying Without Wings: It pointed out that everyone out there is looking for something, which will complete them. You will never know where you will find it, cos it could be everywhere and might just appear where you least expected it.

       I am practically quite busy nowadays. Not because I have a lot of works to do. Just that my management like to come to me and say "Please print/do this for me. I want it in today", "Pauline, is it ready?", "No, this is not what I want. I want it to be in this way", "Pauline, can you add something to this for me".... and it goes on.  Anytime soon, I will be having a heart attack or maybe a nervous breakdown.  Why don't people plan? By planning, they will have everything ready and not do things blindly.  I really hope I won't be the one having a nervous breakdown.  Signing off...

       Just when I was thinking my company is going to keep me with my current job while slowly groom me into an Implementer ... and thinking whether they will actually do that - my doubts were answered yesterday.  When I arrived at work yesterday, I met up 2 of my colleagues and my CEO for breakfast. I was told to take care of the new project which is going to start. Still blur from the morning blues, I just nodded. My colleague told me, someone told the CEO I am bored with my current work. I wondered who. I never talk to anyone about my work ...  unless he saw my blog!   Then later, I was given my first task as an Implementer...and it kept me busy for the whole day  and  night. First time burning mid-night oil since working here.  Sigh.      I wonder what Implementers do. How I am going to handle this new project when I have never been an Implementer. The other two implementers are outstation. I guess I will have to take one thing at a time. Think about it when it comes.

           Part 3   I was hiding. Was I? I was hiding. Why? I was hiding. What for?  I have been hiding away from making a decision - for I do not know whether I will like my decision at the end. That is why I buried my soul into Harry Potter for the past few weeks. Day and night, I look and search for HP. I want to live in the HP fantasy so I wouldn't have to give an answer. I never give my body and brain a chance to rest. I read and re-read HP. I talk HP day-and-night. I watch HP when I am free so I wouldn't have to think of  'other thing'.   And What ' other thing'  is that?  September is approaching. And I will be flying to Auckland. Am I coming back to Malaysia? Am I leaving for good? I have been thinking about that since yesterday's meeting.
