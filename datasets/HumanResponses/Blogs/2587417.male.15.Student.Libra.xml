      Wow... my own blog... that is so cool.... i never would have... WAIT ONE MINNUTE!!! I had a blog before, duh!  Ok anyways, what is up world, i am the dizzy one, at school they call me Jake... why? I dunno. Anyways, this is where I will rant on about stupid things and hopefully someone will read it. I HOPE!!!! Um... has anyone ever hurd of the movie Volcano High? It was on MTV, but they butchered it to the point that anyone who saw it in it's orginial form, they wouldn't really enjoy the movie on MTV. Sure, there are rappers that really suck at doing voice overs (except Method Man who did Mr. Ma. Now that was good voicing same with snoop dogg doing Hak-rim, althouhg he really didn't speak that much), and were probably paid a large sum of money to do it.  THe story ALMOST stayed the same (fortunately) except for the fact that Jang was never with Chae (Jade in MTV's version since her nick name was Icy Jade in the Korean Version) to begin with, he was attempting to steal he heart from... someone, i think it was hak-rim... no that was SOH Yo-sun, she wrote a crap load of love letters that aren't sent... o well, and that the principal was put in a stun and that hak-rim never actually recived the scrolly thingy, he was shown it in a dream.... hm... mabey if they wo uld have kept the fight scenes in the right place... no, that sitll wouldn't have made up for it... stupid MTV!!!! O well, it is 2k4, aand as usual, nothing has changed... wow, what a new year (so far) we still have all of 2k4 to look for a new MGS (hopefully) DOOM III (yup, thats right) Half Life 2 (that hacker who stole the code had a point, i guess...)  FF XIII (yes, thats right Final Fantasy 12, yum) and KH 2 (Kingdom Hearts 2, although it is a aprtnership with disney, launching pooh off a swing going almost 50 yards is fun... although he doesn't come up a bloody mess... hm...) plus, mabey microsoft wont have such a bad year with viruses, and apple and linux or *unix (* = anything that is unix based) will become more popular with the ignorant masses than the norm Windows PC... ah yes, then there is anime makng a comeback.... maey it will become it's own academy award some day.... since we are on the topic of anime, I wish there was a naruto this week!!! now i must wait another week to see SOsuke beat the hell out of Gaara... that will be cool, and Live action Sailor Moon, gotta love it.. ok, well i got to go do paper route at about 6:30, and it is almost 4, in the morning, sooo, a 2 1/2 hour nap is in place, OK   Peace

       The Counsole Wars Are On!!   Nintendo vs. Sony in handhelds, yes handhelds.  Big N will ge t a run for their money with the codename DS handeheld to go up aginst the PSP, Both attempting for a November releasebut as we all know, that wont happen.... but if it does it will be 2 screens vs. one.  yes you hurd me, 2 screens, the GBADS (y not, lets call it that) will have 2 screes on it, the solid state carts will have a gig of memory (mini-DVD) and thats all I know... The PSP as you all know will have PS2 Like Graphics and will use a hyper MD type of memory for games, but can have movies and music on them too.  Well, I say Why worry about handhelds, but then again, if I can get good looking graphics on a handheld, the only thing I will have to worry about us the battery life.    Then there are the gaming counsoes.  Sony vs. Big N vs. Microsoft and The Phantom by infinitive labs.  Microsoft will probably be sitting on HALO 2 until the Xbox Next comes out in late 2k5 early 2k6.  OHHHH, I hear the pissed off Xbox fans now.. ah... a relaxing sound... Anyways there is nothing on the Xbox Next, so I have nothing other than the codename.  Nintendo is like the freaking government, everything is TOP SECERET, tell anyone and we will make you dissapear.  Then Sony's PS3.  That will have a cell processor made by IBM and have an ati graphics card.  The Ironic thing is that Everyone will have an ATI AND IBM Processor.    The counsole wars are getting bigger and probably will go on as long as gamers like me want cool games.  I want the PS3 now, and Halo 2 to be set back to a lunch with the XN, but that is my opinion, make it a 2 or three disk game that has a rich story in a FPS and have graphics that look better than DOOM.  While I am on the subject of PC games, the revival of PC Games will be this year,  With DOOM 3 and Half Life 2 coming out this year we will see almost everyone in the world reserving both games and everyone playing them; hacking them.  I got to go to bed now, cause I gots lto get up for FINALS... dreaded finals. Peace...

      The Super Bowl, the end of the football season... I watch it only for the commercials, and there is one that aired that kinda pissed me off, RIAA I hope you are happy.   Downloading From iTunes for  Free   Ok, it istarts with a couple of kids pictures and it says something like Busted, or, Caught.  Then one is like  We Will Still Download music for free.  That is true.  Then It says Apple is giving away 1 million free songs, even better.  Now I say, how about this, the RIAA stops being monopolistic bastards and stop being greedy. They have already fuct my future.  Bastards.  Now I download from iTunes, but I want my 3 grand back!!! and I should be in a commercial!!! WTF!!!   So I tell everyone who has not gotten hit by the RIAA to steal, steal as much as you can so the RIAA is no more.  Ok, now that im done ranting, has enyone hurd Toxic by Brittany spears?  That song RULES!!! I wish there was an instramental version.  it would make a nice base beat.  The video isn't that bad either... ok peace!!!

       MICROSOFT LISTEN!!!   Ok, I have read some news today and I would like to say some things to Microsoft..  1) Bring the XBOX Kasumi Blue Box to america with the xtra pillow thingy... I would really like it and would give me another reason to give you 200 bucks...  2) Release more security patches, PLEASE  and 3) Give my HALO 2!!!  Ok, anyways, I have nothing to do, so im gonna rant.  I with CD prices would be something like 7 bucks, sure at iTunes, I can get any CD for 10, but I dont have a credit card or any of the prepaid cards... I want a new cell too... I dont really like Virgin Mobile that much... thinkin about goin' to AT&T... GTA4 looks cool, I guy I know that is working on the project said it looks alot better than GTA3 and GTA:VC combined...

       Im here, but not here...  I havent really been feeling like myself lately... I dunno why... I haven't really felt like myself, like I have lost something... I think i am either been shocked by something.. I dont know what but something.. or im stressed out... my.. my mom, she is putting way too much pressure on me, like im some sort of a fawking super teen... now every fawkin' day I get nagged about my grade, and it is starting to piss me off.. it is like  no one trusts me anymore.  I have about and will confront my teachers soon enough, I think I will go insane!    24 Season 1  I love this season of 24 cause it is the first season of 24 I have seen fully... I need the 2nd season...  I love the third season  It kicks A$$... I love it, it is the most suspensful TV show I have ever watched.  If you watch the whole season back to back, (like what I did 12 eps. 1 day, last 12 eps. the next.) and it seems like a big movie!!! O, how I love it!!!

       Applications made easier...  I love filling out applications, because I have nothing better to do with my time!  I think now I have filled out 8 or 9 apps and got no calls back... I will go insane!  I call back and they always say "uh... were not hiring now, but we have your app on file if we need you..."  and then give me an excuse not to tell them that they are idiots. But then again, why hire a 15 year old who is still in high school then hire a college student who will only be working for the summer! If thats your deal then fine, Wendys, Perkins, Gamestop, EB Games, Wal*Mart, Shopko,  K-Mart, Culvers, and Burger King, be that way!   Im gonna apply for Online learning  I think it is a good idea, a high school letting kids who are adept to computers learn online... maybe I will be posting here even more next year, but on schoo subjects... god that would be cool...
