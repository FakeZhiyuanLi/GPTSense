        Today was an ok day. It was basicaly like every other day. After school me and my two friends went to oor old school to visit our teachers. But they wouldn't let us because we didn't make a "Reservation". So we walked all that was for nothing! Gr. I don't know if they did but they were forced to call the police if we didn't get off the campus. But that was ok because Mrs. Shelling let us use the phone and get a drink. So ha. Middle schoolers suck. :P So we casue the Alex bus to my house and here we are! Anyways, woh....There's a little note on the computer desk saying " Pat + Jaye Larsen...and then an e-mail and a number. But i'm not gonna tell you cause you'll call them...Maybe...Ok, that's enough typing. Laters!

        Well, this morning was interesting...I got to school, set up everything, then played what I had to. Later, when the sun arisied over the school and into my eyes, it was difacult. But when it was time to take everything over to the feild, it was even more difacult. Cecilia and I took one cart and Nick took the other. No, it wasn't just a light weight cart with nothing on it. On one was two marimbas, music stands, and backpacks and on the other cart was the Timpani, backpacks, and cybal stands and cybals. So me and Cecialia pushed the cart half was up the hill to the feild when suddenly Nick needed help. So basicly I ran to each of them and helped then out. Then when we got to the feild, basicly everyone ran out of water. And it was fucking hot! Anyway, my day went ok i guess. My student that I was tutoring keeps being late! Damn him. Gr. So I told him if he doesn't come earlyer, then I will be forced to eat lunch with him. It was quiet funny. Ok, I shall stop typing now. Toodles!

         Sorry everyone that I haven't been updading my journal, my dad wouldn't let me on the computer... Stupid dad...Anyway, nothing really happened these past few days. I'm really happy though because i'm home with my mom and I haven't seen her in two weeks! So yeah, i'm really happy. :) I've now gotten used to getting up at 5:00 in the morning so I guess that's cool. I'm still friends with the same people as always, which that is cool. And I made some new friends, YAY. Oh my god Alina, I want to read the rest of your story, it's so good! I was going to ask you for a copy! Please. ^^ Anyway, today, first period was math. And I got mixed up with my other classes and I kept saying the room number. F134. F134. F134. And of corse, ones are on the bottom floor and twos are on the top. So I was on top floor looking for my class while people were going to class and clearing out of the halls. So then I thought " Wait a minuate... my class is on the bottom floor!" So I ran as fast as I could down the hall and down the stairs whitch I aalmost tripped running down... And I finally got to my class before the bell rang. Woh, I've written to much...Ok, see you next post! (Sorry again for being late on posting)

       Well, today was an ok day. Except I got hit in the head with someones locker above mine...Anyway, the anime club is starting up tomarrow. Yay. And i'm going to join! Oh wait...I allready joined...Oh well...I ate a squishy cookie for lunch. Yay for the squishy cookie! I also showed my teacher what anime is. ~smile~~smile~ Curse you Alina, making me change my backround. But I guess the blue backround is ok...I guess i'll post my poems now. Bye till the next post!    Lost Love   You thought love was a game,   You allways wanted to play,   You joked around silly,   You lost me in one day,   If you missed me so much,   Then where was your call,   Your lies are so big,   And your truths are so small...   Quiet Blood   Thinking in the dark,    Talking on the phone,   Laying in your bed,   Look you're all alone,   You smile and close your eyes,   And then hum your special note,   You open up your eyes,   As a person slit your throat...        All poems by Shauna
