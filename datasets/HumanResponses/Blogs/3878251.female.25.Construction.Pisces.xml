        Any time spent in the great city of Melbourne with the Professor is incomplete without a quick trip to JB Hi-Fi for a sly CD bargain. Thus, Thursday afternoon, between lunch on Lygon and bevies off Brunswick, we squeezed in some quality time in the gaudy, jam-packed outlet.  This trip I restricted myself to picking up a cheap copy of an old Eels album (that I have previously been remiss enough to neglect) and the first Lemon Jelly CD that until now, I only had access to on the Professor’s PC (not always convenient).  But now it’s Franky’s! The ultimate in lazy afternoon background music as it hums along, my foot bouncing, head tapping side to side to side. Mmm. Love it…

      A small but stellar cast features on this little amble through daily delights and it may be helpful to get to know some of them.  Franky, who sits here at the controls, is a Sydney girl without a vocation. With a penchant for baking and new shoes, it doesn't take much to delight this brussel sprout!  At her feet you'll often find the hero of our journey, Buzz, the giant Sheltie, a real family fellow. He has mastered the art of luxuriating in small pleasures, with running, eating and possum patrol at the top of his joy list. Franky has something to learn from he who treasures only a broken plastic plant pot and a chewed up golf ball. Beyond those few items, all other worldly things merely pass by with only the occasional nuzzle or sniff as acknowledgement of it's existence.  .flickr-photo {	border: solid 2px #000000;}.flickr-yourcomment {}.flickr-frame {	text-align: left;	padding: 3px;}.flickr-caption {	font: 75%;/*	color: #666666; */	margin-top: 0px;}.flickr-buddyicon {	margin-right:5px; 	vertical-align:middle;	border: solid 1px;}.flickr-postedby {	font: 75%;}  	 urlLink    	  urlLink Buzz , originally uploaded by  urlLink Franky .

      My natural state, no matter the weather, is bare foot, with toes wiggling and soles to ground. The professor often catches me tip-toeing on icy floors in the middle of winter and has to march me off for socks and slippers. Year by year I gain more skill and polish to my renditions of the graceful "hot-concrete quick-trot," the spectacular wincing style of the "sharp-gravel light-step," not to mention the ever popular, "bindy-patch-discovery hold-that-pose".  This foolish dedication explains my appreciation for the ever lazy thong (footwear, not underwear), the clever combination of bare foot benefits with the comfort of rubber. All I need is a pair of thongs in every colour and there’s my summer footwear sorted!  As for the wintry cold? I generally opt for my faithful black Eccos, with all the style and sophistication you expect from a pair of "comfortable" women’s runners. Not much. But they are quick, light and, well you guessed it, comfortable!  So why my fascination with shoes and all their trappings? Why my slavery to laces, buckles, tongues? Why my weakness for high heels, fine leather, stylish design? What is it about these beautiful little fashion accessories that has me quickly recalculating my monthly budget? What does a thong loving, sneaker resorting, barefoot at heart like Franky NEED with all these shoes?  I love them!    .flickr-photo {	border: solid 2px #000000;}.flickr-yourcomment {}.flickr-frame {	text-align: left;	padding: 3px;}.flickr-caption {	font: 75%;/*	color: #666666; */	margin-top: 0px;}.flickr-buddyicon {	margin-right:5px; 	vertical-align:middle;	border: solid 1px;}.flickr-postedby {	font: 75%;}  	 urlLink

        I first heard this album in the wee hours of a Saturday morning as I found myself sipping on gin & tonic and struggling to keep my tired mind on a game of 500’s. Nothing could have suited more the still shadowy night, the husky masculinity of the group, the thoughtful reserved nature of the game. This album combines a wry and delicate melancholy with a sexy carefree ease.  When I listen to it, in my mind’s eye I rather fancy that I am soaking in the over brimming bubbles of a claw-footed bathtub, lounging in the candle light by an old gramophone. Of course, in my mind’s eye, I am also much taller with wonderful chocolate brown curls piled up on my head and I believe I am smoking a cigar and sipping from a glass of whiskey. In my mind's eye, mind you.

      Trust the good old Women’s Weekly cookbooks to deliver another hit! This one was a little more fiddly than some but quite different and very tasty. I rustled it up to take for dinner to my two night classes but there’s plenty left for Ma and Pa Goodsmith to enjoy too. Professor will happily miss out as he is one of that delusional bunch who believe it best to keep savoury and sweet firmly on either side of the dinner/dessert divide.  Here 'tis:  1 cup chopped raisins 3 green onions,* chopped finely 1 apple, peeled & grated 1/2 tsp ground ginger** 1/2 cup breadcrumbs 1kg chicken thigh fillets 1 Tbsp olive oil 1/3 cup blanched toasted almonds*** 1/2 cup orange juice 1/4 cup plum jam 1/2 cup dry white wine 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon**** 1 cup chicken stock*****  * I used the ones with bulbs and long green shoots. Who knows what you call them wherever you are! ** As a hardened anti-ginger in savoury protester, I cut this down from 1tsp, to make a stand, you see. YOU can make your own choice about this, I know you’ll do the right thing… *** Don’t be a total sucker for hard work like me, just buy them pre-blanched and pre-toasted **** Realised JUST NOW that I forgot the cinnamon. Can’t vouch for tasty meal if added. Will try it next time though… Yes, there will be a next time. *****Quite like using these little stars and wanted one last chance!  Combine raisins, onion, apple, breadcrumbs and ginger in a bowl and spread tablespoons onto each fillet, rolling them up and fastening with toothpicks. (This part is the fiddly, sticky-fingered part. Not recommended for tired or grumpy cooks. Relaxing ONLY if you’re already relaxed!)  Heat the oil in a big saucepan and brown the thighs on each side. Remove from the saucepan and add the remaining of the ingredients to it, bringing them to the boil. Replace the chicken and cook for 20mins or much, much longer if you like a sticky rich sauce. I also added the remaining stuffing to the juices in the saucepan about halfway through cooking time.  Serve on rice with lots of crispy vegies. YUM! (Or you could plop it into a little tub to retrieve from your bag once it has congealed and wolf down the cold, slightly shaken chicken in your 15 minute dinner break spent in a garishly bright-lit TAFE cafeteria.)
