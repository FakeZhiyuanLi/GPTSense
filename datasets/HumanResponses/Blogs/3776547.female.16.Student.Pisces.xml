Ha, they can all go and kiss my ass I don't give a damn.&nbsp; If they wanted us to march we should of at least had a weeks notice.&nbsp; Plus, my Aunt Ellie is comming in this weekend.&nbsp; She lives in Wyomie. As far as I am concerned I am not marching and if I get in trouble for it I will just quit.&nbsp; I don't even fucking care if I go to disney or not!&nbsp; Ugghhh!!!&nbsp; If you can't tell MArching Band stresses me out.&nbsp; Oh, thinking of that I will probley have to go get my medicine again b/c of all the fucking stress.&nbsp; MY GOD, what am I going to do?&nbsp;&nbsp;O. yeah I remember I am not going to be in it my Jr. and Sr. years.&nbsp; Its a waste of my time!&nbsp; Now that I have said all that. Have a nice day!

      I had a wonderful weekend. Renne and I went to Altoona to see her room mate Janna.  The reason we went was to see the movie Sleep Over becasue Renne and Janna's freinds are in the movie they are the bad that plays at the dance in the movie. Everone should go see that movie the movie is cheeseie but the band ROCKS!  I am going to be able to see them at Worped Tour!  Then Saturday we swam for a bit in Janna's pool. Then went to the mall.  Then we went to State College. We went and saw a free concert!  OMG we saw Lit!  The bass player thew a pic at Jana and she totally missed that he did that so I picked it up and gave it to her. And her thew one for Renee. And at the end of the concert he thew me Janna and Renee all pins. Well it was a fun weekend but damn am I tired so I think I am gonna go take a nap!  We did not get home until 4am and then this moring we drove home so I am so tired!  I dont know when I will be able to post again because once again I am at my Dads for the week.  But when I can sneek up here I will post as much as I can!

      OMG today my mom and I went and did aarons and well it was fun just because I got my hair cut and well she and I talked about my car and about getting the bar-bell in my ear that I have wanted for so long!  Who knows if it will ever happen thought because I was like mom if I pay for the bar-bell will you take me to get it done and she was like sure but if you can pay for your bar-bell that means you can pay for your car insurance. She was like and to do both of thoes you need money and to get money you need a job.  She was like so yeah I dont see you getting you bar-bell done!  I am so going to prove her wrong!  I will win!  Like I always do!

      I have a boyfriend Yet I seam to be attracted to other guys The one I want is the one I cant have The one I have seams not to have time for me The one who has time for me and wants to be with me Yeah I am wating for him to call me back And unlike the one I have he does call back! So the question is what to do and who do I really want to be with I know the answer but I cant have what I want! So then I suppose I should take my second best offer And break up with the one who is not good for me!

Ya know having a boyfriend is more trouble than I thought!  I have not decied what I like to do more, be single or be in a realtionship.  I suppose if my relationship was a bit more communication freindly it would be better.  But ya take what ya can get!

             Well lets see not many things going on lately just staying home an doing nothing much.  Just woring about boys.  And actually for once they both are great guys.  Randy was to call me and never did but hey I am not going to hold anything aginst him.  Maybe he had to go somewhere.  I will hopefully talk to him soon and I hope he feels the same about me as I feel.  Because I would like to date him.  And Josh and I do feel the same for eachother.  But he made a valid point.  We should not date,  we should just be friends, until school starts that way we can see eachother more.
