      victory!  a danish proverb!  anyway...  today at work was so completely surreal.  i was on shakes, meaning i don't get to share my lovely personality with just anyone.  in fact, today i got to share it with no one, save the ice cream tubs at which i cursed vehemently every time i had to change them out (there just HAS to be a better way). the thing about shakes is, i just like drinking them.  on to surrealism.  the other fun part about being on shakes is fronting, meaning you get to wipe down the tables, "be personable" (after cursing at the ice cream tubs, who wants to deal with people!), and otherwise pretend to be doing actual work.  we were slow, and i was caught between two images.  the first was quite appropriate for what seemed to be the general mood dujour:  the sinking titanic scene (from said movie) where the violinists continue playing despite the chaos around them.  at potbelly sandwich works, we have independent artists who come and perform during lunch (sometimes to our dismay, especially when "wheels on the bus" is the artist's fave pick).  today the potbelly titanic was sinking to hey jude.  and then some elton john songs.  i don't know.  all i know is, i was wiping the tables and couldn't help feeling apart from the erratic cacophony around me.  the second image, more comical and less poignant, was of the scene in pleasantville where the guy in the diner just keeps wiping the counter... and wiping the counter...  and wiping the counter.  Freedom is a horse.  and i know how to ride.

      for grins, get a new email account  urlLink here .    tonight there were amazing stars out.  i drove home with my chin on the steering wheel so i could look up through my windshield.  this, in my humble opinion, is the best time for the sky; before the humidity and bugs set in and after the cold and snow.  i should spend less time blogging and more time looking at them.  what i like about the stars is that they haven't changed in millions of years.  not that they haven't changed; in fact many of them no longer exist in technical terms because they expired millions of years ago and only now the light has reached us (or me).  what was going here or elsewhere in the universe when the light i see tonight was originally released?  but still, i see the same pictograms that the ancient greeks and egyptians philosophized and debated; i like feeling that sort of connection to transcend time.  tonight the sky is an eternal blankness and a thousand stories all at once.

      Faith pours from your walls, drowning your calls I've tried to hear, you're not near Remembering when I saw your face Shining my way, pure timing Now I've fallen in deep, slow silent sleep it's killing me, I'm dying  To put a bit of sunshine in your life  Soleil all over you, warm sun pours over me Soleil all over you Warm sun  Now this slick fallen rift came like a gift your body moves ever nearer And you will dry this tear Now that we're here, and greave for me, not history But now I'm dry of thoughts, wait for the rain Then its replaced, sun setting  And suddenly we're in love with everything  Soleil all over you, warm sun pours over me Soleil all over you Warm sun

      don't ever think that just because someone is nice doesn't mean they will be trampled upon.  don't ever take for granted those around you who try to be respites of fun and easygoingness.  cross people off your list who do take you for granted!  thus spake amythustra.  so.. it's the weekend after earth day.  we're still quibbling over oil and 20 year old kids are still dying.  is the world a better place this election year?  (it will be if i get that civic).  there are so many neighborhoods everywhere in random cities that no one otherwise thinks of that are decorating trees and yards with ribbons and flags to commemorate someone dead from the war.    war.  oh at the little trivial things that piss me off on a daily basis that don't even compare to how much it pisses me off that these kids... people who haven't even really defined their own taste in music, let alone a political stance or philosophical understanding of or for what they fight... and they're dying and it's just not right.  but here we are being so protected.  great.  i bet they felt real friggin protected being americans and all.  war on terrorism.  it's good to declare war on abstract concepts, right?  next we can declare a war on envy.  or how about a war on lust.  i'm awake and feeling unrequited.  too many thoughts clashing about in my brain.  it's the mcdonalds freedom fries, i swear!  me and my poor trivial world.   people die every day and you know what, it doesn't make a bit of difference.  calvin and hobbes has the best illustration of this, where calvin sets hobbes up to play war, and they hit eachother with pop-guns, and hobbes asks "so how do you know when you win?"  something to that effect.  i'm safe and sound with my dsl internet, samsung phone, and kickass car.  my gas costs went up.  ho hum.  people haven't learned to appreciate eachother at all; if anything maybe having soo much "5 more kids died in afganistan today" reports has made us all oblivious to appreciating or sanctifying life and love and those around us.  we are jaded and self-absorbed.    i'm so angry.  i wish i could see things the way other people do so that i can make sense of it all.  get all those lousy "feelings" out and be numb like everyone else.  i feel too sensitive about things around me (not waah waah sniffly sensitive, but sensing sensitive).  i truly enjoy driving on a sunny day and looking out and feeling everything around me and flapping my hand out the window in the air currents and smiling at random people.  all the other people on the road seem so unaware of all the life around them.  i feel like the kid in american beauty videotaping the plastic bag.  "Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it, like my heart's going to cave in."

      oh, to be like a cat.  this morning found me sprawled across sheets and pillows basking in the breeze from my window.  so comfortable.  not really sleeping... just lazing about with my cat, defying the alarm to rouse me into work.  i find myself to be surrounded by wonderful, inspiring, benevolent people, and i think that's fantastic.  this morning i felt lucky (to not have to wake up early, mwoohoohoohahaha) and safe for once, that there are those out there who laugh in the world as i do.  thanks.

      welcome to paradise, can i start a sandwich for you?  ah yes, glorious spring.  turtledoves getting up early in the morning and telling the whole neighoborhood about it... flip flops are officially "in" and it's not cold at night...  flies in eden plays tuesday night 8:30 at the elbo room (all should go!  all should go!).  the cubs are playing... i think this year's the year i actually attempt to save up money for season tickets.  that would be sweeeeeet!  solo tu sabes bien quien soy  y por eso es tuyo mi corazon  solo to doblas mi razon y por eso a donde tu quieras voy.

      "I'd give everything for a loaf of bread if it meant making a sandwich with you."  Thank you Alabama for teaching me how to appreciate the spring.  when i was just a yankee with little grits experience, i thought spring was some lousy-still-cold mushy-ground-nothing-happens-still stuck in school with no hope of a snow day-season.  now, granted it's almost MAY (which is called summer in other parts of the country) i'm noticing buds.  not just buds... trees with life on them (no, not the friggin squirrels and birds; that's another website entirely).  i saw this one tree (some kind of magnolia actually, but with pink buds) where the blossoms were just begging to explode out.  it was really cool.  i've never noticed spring up here in this way before, but everywhere i look i see japanese maples with tiny dwarved leaves just starting to seep out from otherwise gray branches.  everything is coming alive (with the exception of the plants i killed in the bathroom; it's not my fault i was remodeling the bathroom and forgot they were there!... well, i guess that makes it my fault.. oh well) and i dunno, it just seems fitting.  i'm trying to find my way; the plants are trying to find their way... at least it's not below zero anymore!  (although it made a convincing threat earlier this week; i'd say the weird weather is why the cubs lost.......).  alabama isn't a bad place, although i'd rather have all my favorite restaurants from down there up here because it makes my life easier... they now rank dead last in most categories involving the judicial system, but they do have both mountains and beaches and nice spring (and sweet tea, and waffle house).    if there's one... no, several things i would give a toe for, it would be:  purple onion (o thank heaven for 24 hour greek food and mint iced tea), zapopans (only i would make it also 24 hours, just so that i could have cheap mexican food and tequila at my whim, and what's with the white queso only being made in alabama?  it is the nectar of the GODS!  ok, so they were aztec gods.  but still!), taziki's (just because it's good), and blue moon bbq (and i would, can you guess, force them to be open 24 hours so that i might indulge in pulled pork and carrot cake whenever the mood should strike).  this, i fully believe, would make the world a better place.  i think it's a bit ironic that i'm bored with food up here and miss food from alabama... isn't chicago supposed to be this great mishmash of societies?  although i do never tire of italian food or hot dogs, and i sorely missed italian beef when i was down there...  welp folks, it's about time for me to indulge my ears and mind with the indomitable hayden.   urlLink  Open your eyes Put it in drive get on the road and just go.

      "What do I do this for? Got to get out some more Go down to the grocery store Meet someone I'll adore Someone who'll make me laugh Someone to be my better half Keep me warm under the sack Share with me my midnight snack"  ( urlLink Hayden , "Bad as They Seem")  Thank the sweet lord above that hayden is coming to save my soul tomorrow night at martyrs :)  music exists so that we, the listening public, don't have to say how we feel out loud!  (except of course when singing in the car)  Actually, what i like about this particular song are these two stanzas:   Job of my dreams... Things are as bad as they seem Working where I did at fourteen Making less pay it seems   Chorus   House of my dreams... Things are as bad as they seem My parents' house I'll stay for free Until I'm at least fourty-three   So true, so true...  I was thinking again about eternal sunshine and who i really would cut out of my memories if i could...  and it's not even someone i had a torturous relationship with either (not that any of my relationships were ever tortured; in fact most were long and enjoyable until they just grew past the expiration date... not all relationships are destined for marriage.  ok, except for one that was long, enjoyable, and tortured...and decidedly not marriage-bound).  sidenote.  my best friend is getting married.  this is not something i understand.  i read somewhere that a bride is a woman with a great future behind her... and i really like that!  i have one friend (see the sweetnlow aftertaste comment) who will never go away and seeps into memories where dammit, he's just not wanted.  a falling out between friends is hard.  especially when two people are waaay too hardheaded for his or her own good.  and so, dr. mierzwiak, could you PLEASE take him away?  please?  i'll even relinquish (and it's a cool memory, but i'll skip it) the memory of climbing up the inner workings of palmer hall to the cupola and watching the cops circle montevallo.  it was cold, but life-affirming.  and i'll give it away to please please please not have to wonder what kind of fate befell this friend.  lousy generic names.  from now on i shall have only friends with interesting names!  so that should i ever lose them, i can find them later due to their individual names!  (what a horrible thing to say.  so, don't be hardheaded.  keep the people you care about.  even when they're WRONG!).  but seriously, i was considering revamping my music interests and starting all over with small indy bands that only i've heard of AND NO ONE ELSE that i presently know.  not that what i listen to evokes any particular person... but even though what i like is decidely my own taste, it's been lived-in...  (music can be lived-in.  i've been living in mine for at least five years... and all the new stuff is often just next-door neighbors to where i already lived.  hayden was more of an out of town visitor staying with someone further down the street.)  ...and i want to live in something new.  although i'd just turn around and share it again... there is nothing like showing someone a new band and seeing the smile as they wonder "wow, i didn't realize i was this way."   urlLink chan marshall  had an awesome quote about her theory on why people like music, and when i find it, i'll send it.  i'm not the gollum of music (my preciousssssssssss).  which is why all bored, uninspired, or busy, overinspired persons should consider going to martyrs.  because hayden is great.  and i'm an enabler:  see how i'm enabling you to go!

      "the family that is sick together, sticks together."  huh?   all i know is that in this past weekend of easter melee and family bonding, i have seen lots and lots of movies and food network tv and experienced many more communal sneezing experiences.  truly, there is nothing like being home with the family when you all have the same cold at the same exact time, curled up feverish-like on the couch with a plate of baker's square french silk, pondering the evolution of women through the 50s to now.  i challenge any man to give me a hoover for christmas!  (see:  why i like wood floors).  now, a honda hybrid... that's a whole other matter entirely.  i'd give up a little bit of subservience for that... wait, no i wouldn't!  i'd promise   subservience, but "not today dear."  (and tomorrow's not looking good either, eh?)  tylenol, oh sweet elixir of life and survival during mocha malt frappucino concoctions and t-ball coaching gone awry... thank you north central high for double booking your gym and giving me monday night off, so that i might...  oh, spend the evening on the internet again?!?

      "It's not Easter until the plastic grass comes out the cat's butt."  Life is a metal lunchbox of photographs.  Tonight i found all the art i did from high school:  about 30 sheets of negatives, some with proof sheets; old test strips; copies of chinese art that, had i known better, i would have done something litho-cool with; old sketches; scattered thoughts poised on torn notebook scraps.  I would love to have a conversation with some people who are "gone, but not forgotten."  This led to a few fruitless internet searches; why oh why do we always have to be bad versions of ourselves at points in time; why does it have to be so hard to track some people down; why do some people stick with you even against your will; even when it goes against the core of your being, why that name or this smell or these jokes evoke only THAT person, and it's lost, for whatever reasons - because too much time has past; because you were stubborn; because even though you made some lousy bowl in ceramics as an "i'm sorry, glad you graduated" gift you were too prideful to give it.  it's not regret, it's something else; something vengeful, something nice and sweet that glides over your tongue but gives a sweetnlow aftertaste.  i wonder if some jokes will ever be funny with others.  i take such simple amusement in each day, and at each chuckle it's one of those "ya had to be there" moments where if i explained the joke or my humor in it, it's lost.  lately it seems like new jokes or new humor is few and far between.  i laughed out loud in church today.  i love to laugh and tend to do so freely; i think i was the only one laughing... it made me remember a time when one of my friends said they liked the way i laugh because it reminded them of kids watching saturday morning cartoons.    we walk through life so unaware and so uncareful; we don't go with our gut when it's practically pounding us on the back of the head.  for some it's about being true to an ideal, or maintaining routine for the sake of sameness.  my mind and my gut are both so vocal it's hard to tell which i'm following most of the time.  and if i followed my heart, i'd really be a lost cause.  i was thinking about jail last night; about who i'd call if i had to trust someone to save me, and the only thing i'm really sure about is that my sister would bail me out.  i've always thought of myself as trusting, and i am, but there are levels, and it's decidedly near-impossible for me to trust that deeply.  so way to go sis, you made the list.  you are the list.   urlLink jai guru deva om ...

       How to live a superfluous life.   1.  Know the meaning of the word "superfluous."   (Being beyond what is required or sufficient; serving no useful purpose; having no excuse for being.)   --i liked the first one better--  Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a starter home. Choose dental insurance, leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose your future.  There's 158 miles on the tank.  I don't know where they came from or where we'll be when the gas runs out.  All week I've thought of myself as being superfluous.  For the love of god, if you don't read anything else on the internet, read  urlLink this .  april 10 will make you feel better.  or maybe not better.  but it will make you feel something.  and if it doesn't, don't go complaining to me about it.  Choose an escape.

      How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!  The world forgetting, by the world forgot.  Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!  Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;  Labour and rest, that equal periods keep;  "Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep;"  Desires compos'd, affections ever ev'n,  Tears that delight, and sighs that waft to Heav'n.  Grace shines around her with serenest beams,  And whisp'ring angels prompt her golden dreams.  For her th' unfading rose of Eden blooms,  And wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes,  For her the Spouse prepares the bridal ring,  For her white virgins hymeneals sing,  To sounds of heav'nly harps she dies away, And melts in visions of eternal day.

      ok.. it's midnight and i'm still up despite a grand total of six hours of sleep over the past two days.  why?  and for what?  i don't know.  i'd love to blame it on my ever-so-fertile-yet-silent-genius-type mind, but lately i've been wondering if perhaps my brain is in some form of dormancy.  (oh, so that explains the blog site, you say!).  not to be stating the obvious and already over-discussed, but i've been thinking about societal apathy.  it's definitely easier to be apathetic.  lately i've stopped listening to my beloved NPR, Howard Stern, or anything resembling news because i've just gotten tired of yelling (usually at the car in front of me while driving) that everything on the news is propaganda bullshit spoon fed to us, the lame and living dead society, by what amounts to be one huge-government run media super-whore.    and this relates to me in this way:  recently i applied for a job - for which i was hugely qualified and for which i would have been totally awesome.  i got passed up for an intern whose project conveniently happened to be the recently vacated job's description.  no big deal; i've only worked for this company for two years already and have a degree.  really, no biggie; it's not like i bartended or worked 2 jobs plus volunteer and extracurricular work while getting said degree with a good gpa.  no problem.  i mean, i was just killing a few years and a few more thousand dollars for grins.  don't we all?    my problem is this.  i can accept being passed up for a job - even if by an as-yet-technically unqualified undegreed intern - because hey, her soon to be obtained degree is in the field specified and i like to think of mine as in the "or related field" category.  everyone keeps saying "nobody cares what degree you have, it's that you HAVE a degree."  yeah right.  i'll argue to anyone that my experiences (although yes, untraditional; non-standard; seemingly non-directional; insert adjective here...) make me a better candidate because of the hard work involved; the willingness to do any job "no matter how small"; the ability to deal with people in countless different settings:  as a lobbyist; as a business-suited professional; as customer service assistant; as a bartender; as a server; as the barista who also grills sandwiches and remembers your name; as a teacher; as a tutor; as a counselor; as a coach; as someone commissioned to sell you furniture.  not to mention work i've done where people weren't involved, for what it's worth.  i like to think i'm versatile and broadminded and willing to try anything and intelligent enough to figure things out and be good at them.  (with the possible exception of advanced organic chemistry or advanced physics, which both fall under the "did that once, don't have to do that again" category.)  so yeah, back to my problem.  i seem to be a self-fulfilling prophesy:  because the work i did to survive in college was in a service-related industry, i seem to be only qualified for jobs in that industry.  the two jobs of the week:  starbucks and potbellys.  and trust me, i'll love them both.  i like people, i really like food, and i particularly like the part where i get things free AND get paid.  these two companies thus far seem to think i'm great and they're "glad to have me on board."  way to go, college degree.  there's lots of jobs i'd love to apply for, except that they all require a legal case in order for me to paint for them why i should have the job over someone who... oh yeah, meets the requirements to a T.  me and my lousy spontaneity.  but, when you have bills, the bills don't care where you get the money from or how it might impact your resume later.  and my resume may not look stellar standard, but at least i have good credit, right?  but i'm hella qualified for service industry jobs!  i told my dad tonight that there were management (and beyond!) options at potbellys and that i would be interested in that... he just sighed.  i can just see the visions of checks sent to my college dancing in his head.  oh wait, he didn't send me to college!   i  sent me to college!  it's not like i'm not trying.  i just seem really good at snatching failure from the jaws of victory.

      It's sort of late (early in my world).  I just saw Starsky and Hutch, which was ok in a lame sort of way.  This has probably been the lousiest day in a long long long time:  tears at work, bad haircut.. a day in the life of a girl.  Yeah yeah, tears at work.. echoes of being some meek office underling with nice manicured nails and a slim ego, but no; I train horses and work with special needs kids.  Today I cried at the horse barn.  I have the worst boss on the planet.  I love both of my jobs and until recently felt pretty autonomous within them.  Lately it's like the word "STUPID" or "TOOL" is tatooed across my forehead.  It's so loathesome to be me sometimes; I feel like I notice everything and everyone but I get misread as someone to walk all over.  I hate having faith in the human race.  i want desperately not to.  I want to be apathetic and not care about taxes and their misappropriation, or Alabama and it's backwater politics (or the US with the same....).  I want to not be so willing to sell my 88 Corolla that I've had since high school and have loved dearly; the car that has taken me through turbulent relationships, weather, and road trips.  I want to memorialize the car; I want to sell it for two grand; I want to trade it in for anything different that people won't recognize so I can go places and not still be "oh, it's the rugby girl" over and over again.  You know what; I really friggin hate Los Angeles.  I'm sooo tired of hearing how half the planet is going to go there to "live the dream" and "be a part of the future" and "be where it's all happening."  What, are we all extras in "Almost Famous"?  I have a love/hate relationship with the town myself; but I can't stand it when people hate where there at and they've never bothered to see it for it's possibilities, and so they tear off and have no stock of what they have before they leave.  In the end I guess we're all empty people.  I'm trying to find my own LA as well, but I'm trying to find what makes me happy here before I leave.  Maybe we're all unhappy where we're at.  I'm happy here, but broke...

      ...Alright don't worry even if things end up a bit too heavy We'll all float on...  i'm here and right now i'm happy.  the world keeps spinning away and people go and come.  I was thinking this morning that last year i could never have conceived of my life such as it is today.  last year the late ride made me stay in chicago instead of grad school in auburn.  i never met anyone who questioned that before until the other day.  he said "maybe it would have been better for you to be there."  (and we WEREN'T having a cynical conversation).  i didn't think on it again til this morning when i was driving to work (for whatever random reasons that thoughts creep into my head).  when i think back to last summer and how confused i was about where to go and how to move forward, i think i have.  i'm glad i'm not at auburn.  i think it was more than worth it to test out new people and new situations; i'd probably still be stuck in the same cycles i was in down there.  i probably won't ride with the same people this summer as i did last year, but i do plan on riding.  for all that's happened between now and then, good and bad, i owe it to that ride; to the curve right in front of the hancock where i couldn't close my eyes; to the person riding with me who dropped their sunglasses and i was so preoccupied with the splendor and wonder of knowing i was happy right where i was.  you never really know who you're going to meet, even in small ways, who affect you.  and who continue to affect you:  i barely met someone in the fall who told his friends he thought i was genuine and would make a good friend, and i kept that.  i'm not sure if we are particularly good friends or if i'll ever be as comfortable or confident speaking to him as i was on that particular night, but it was the best compliment (even if filtered through friends) i think i've ever gotten.  i continue to meet people i never even thought existed.  the other night i got to ride on a motorcycle for more than five minutes, and that's probably the best way to view neon lights in the dark.  it's made me discover my old friends all over again (especially being far away from some of them for so long).  i never really understood before how solid my friendship is with big adam, nor did i ever really see his intuition and independence.  he's a rock.  less than a month ago i was plotting my escape yet again.  but it's all good.  just when life gets too boring to tolerate there's another change, or turn, or person you could never have imagined in your head who shows you something unexpected.  and for that, i'm glad.

      lazy days in illinois...  today involved nap-taking on the grassy knolls of naperville, eating, driving, and filming, more eating, and jazz.  the viking is truly the greatest place on this planet sometimes.  tonight was hilarious.  comedy and music.  who knew?  i regretted not calling everyone i knew to be there with us.  big A almost got to sing, but i think they decided he was underdressed.    this is great.  all i ever wanted was someone to wander around with me at my whim!!!!!!!  just kidding.  sort of.

      oh, it was a fantastic day in Chicago...  even though the weather chose to be somewhat uncooperative.  and i rearended someone (both of our faults) resulting in my car having a buckled hood :(  that aside, the adventures continued!  no lounging on the beach though.  lots of beer was enjoyed at various locations, as was a lot of food:  the Billy Goat Tavern (cheezborgers!), Sluggers (deep dish pizza!), the cubby bear, and Wrigley Field's random junk food.  What a way to watch a ball game:  freezing and shivering and mostly full of food and leinenkugel's honey weiss (no oranges this time), and keeping warm by consuming, in this order:  much of a bag of cotton candy, a hot dog, and handful of peanuts.  oh, and hot chocolate, not so much to drink as to thaw otherwise increasingly numb hands encased around the styrofoam.  somewhere in between we also experienced:  checking email and playing keyboards and mp3s at the apple store (soo much fun; so many toys, so little cash); purchasing a bug-repellant longsleeve shirt from orvis; and listening to the artistic/insane ravings of an old black man with earphones on the el.  big A had all the guys around us cheering at the game.. "hey snow!  your mother was a snowblower!  hey snowman, ya must be blind!  missed that one too, eh?  hey batta batta batta!  hey snowman!  cmon snowman, swing!"  nonetheless, and despite his inspired jeering, the cubbies took it from the giants 1-0.  but it was a well fought game i think.  no sosa.  no scores from barry bonds.  lots of shivering.  never, ever enough cheap beer.  oh yeah, did i mention the spot from heaven?  due to my car's newly reconstructed shorter front end, i did a fabulous job of squishing my car between a van and another small car a block north of ontario at rush st.  no meters.  no red or yellow curbs.  i rule.  bob the car is still for sale, by the way.  any offers?  all she needs is love and a good home!

       urlLink KAUFMAN  I wasted it. I admire you, Donald, y'know? I spend my whole life paralyzed worrying what people think of me and you -- you're just oblivious. DONALD I'm not oblivious. KAUFMAN No, you don't understand. I say that as a compliment. I really do.  There was this time in high school. I was watching you out the library window.  You were talking to Sarah Marsh. DONALD Oh, God. I was so in love with her. KAUFMAN I know. And you were flirting with her.  And she was really sweet to you. DONALD I remember that. KAUFMAN Then when you walked away, she started making fun of you with Kim Canetti. It was like they were laughing at me. You didn't know at all. You seemed so happy. DONALD I knew. I heard them. KAUFMAN How come you looked so happy? DONALD I loved Sarah, Charles. It was mine, that love. I owned it. Even Sarah didn't have the right to take it away. I can love whoever I want. KAUFMAN She thought you were pathetic. DONALD That was her business, not mine. You are what you love, not what loves you.  That's what I decided a long time ago.

      "Your Moon is in Capricorn"  'Serious and responsible, you try to carry the world on your shoulders and rarely let others know that you need help and support. You deny or ignore your own emotional needs and feel that others will not accept you if you appear "weak". You are especially uncomfortable with emotional dependency, and will tell yourself and others (even children) not to be a "baby". You need to accept that no one is self-sufficient all the time, and to be gentler with your "childish" emotional needs and wants. To others, you may appear to be rather hard-nosed and tough, with a businesslike attitude toward their personal concerns and feelings. Actually, no one is a truer friend. Your feelings and loyalties run deep, but you often do not let people know how much you care. You also need to learn to relax, enjoy yourself, and play sometimes.'   I made a new friend at the mall, and we were talking about moon signs (like i would know anything about that).  so i was curious and looked it up... this is different i guess from an astrological sign (i really don't give a whole lot of credibility to any of this stuff, but hey, topic of conversation...)  As i was driving home tonight (in my godforsaken, radio-shorted out, devoid of the strokes or any music aside from my humming, yet still kickass blue car) i was thinking (now there's a new phenomenon, right?)...  i was thinking about how full i feel sometimes and yet how powerless at the same time.  i don't want to belong to anyone.  and at the same time i'm trapped, inescapably, beneath my skin with my emotions crowded and shoving against one another, much like a scene from alien.  i feel in love with everyone at times:  with each person's faults more often than the other things.  i don't want to hurt anyone.. i want to help; i want to laugh; i want to camp out and eat smores and not talk for hours on end.  i haven't gone camping in sooooo long; i can't even remember the last time i qualifiably camped where a tent, a fire, and provisions were involved.  i want so much sometimes to just explode and articulate and get out what i feel so i don't have to be stuck with it day in and day out.  i got an email the other day from an old old pen pal of mine (from since we were 12 years old), and it almost pissed me off, because for years and years we had gone on saying how great it would be to finally meet, blah blah blah.  we finally did while i was in college, and it was awesome.  then he spent the next few opportunities where we could have hung out blowing me off because he had a girlfriend.  hey hey hey, i never ever crossed THAT line!  i was mad at the implication; i was just eager to hang out with whom i had perceived was a good friend, not a love interest.  so i stopped bothering to let him know when i would be near the naval base for rugby tournaments or whatever.  so now years later he writes me, casual as ever, like no time has passed, to say "what's up" and "oh, by the way i got a job at LAX and i'm moving."  [los angeles, why do you hate me so?  what did i EVER do to you?  i've been dogged by LA since 2000!  can't it just LEAVE ME ALONE?!?  (but that's a WHOLE other story)  maybe i ought to just move to the lousy town and get it over with].    anyway, rather than beat around about "how are you" and "how's your life" and vying for "my life's greater than yours and here's why" i just asked outright in the second email what made him feel so compelled to write me after such a long hiatus (put in more casual terms, of course).  because i'm really tired of playing cat and mouse when i'm always always ALWAYS the person who cares more in the end (not romantically, but i just care).  i don't want to be bothered with superficial emails if it's just a game of clever verbage.  i'd have to say that at some past point in my life i probably would have paced out the emails and dragged on, hoping that i would somehow inadvertently find out why time passed and i was dropped like a pair of old raggedy shoes.  but what does it matter in the end, to pace out a bunch of otherwise fruitless emails?  then again, i always seem to not stay mad...  i'm like the  urlLink foolish traveler  (4/16) being consumed by monsters, who, eyes gouged out and blind, thanks the monsters for their gift even as they devour him piece by piece.  his blind eyes couldn't read the gift:  a piece of paper saying "fool."

      I  wanna  be bored.  (Maggie Gyllenhaal as Lee,  Secretary )  Caught between a thunderstorm and a bottle of plum wine.  Not a bad way to spend a Sunday in suburbia.  This weekend was, overall, too good to write about.  I'm not sure why exactly because I worked all weekend, and I was sooo tired last night.  Sometimes all you want to do is be completely lazy, irregardless of who it may effect... and oh, was I lazy...  Friday night was good.  Resolutions between people you care about are good.  Dragging overachieving law school friends out for the night is good.  I overate at Yu's Mandarin last night.  And again tonight at Japan 77.  Perhaps a penchant for pan-Asian cuisine is at hand?  I liked my fortune from last night:  You find beauty in ordinary things.  Do not lose this ability.  "stand there, dance with a memory; the caption reads 'it's all over now.'"

      i look back on my life sometimes, and i see where i haven't always been the person i want to be.  i'm pretty sure that i'm not quite yet the person i want to be, but i feel like i'm pretty close.  it's all in the journey...  tonight was exciting and goosebump inducing... i went to borders after work to pick up (trumpets please!) some guide books for italy and liverpool and also an italian speech guidebook.  because i daresay it might be just a tad bit intimidating, going to italy alone and all.  but it's really thrilling too.  i've always always wanted to go and now it's less than a month away... oh... i know i won't want to come back... but then again, i will, because there are those that aren't coming with that i will miss and who will be in my heart the whole time.  besides, i got that fulltime job for the fall.  hello world, amy is status quo!  my mom said that now i can finally fill out those irksome "alumni information" forms from montevallo and say that i have a job as a program coordinator/ day camp director.  i told her i was going to say that i have joined the ranks of the salaried status quo, no thanks to my degree.  heheheh... lousy job-stealing interns...  and those alumni things truly are annoying.  when i get my "montevallo today!" magazine, there never is information in there from people about whom i actually am curious... except this last time, there was a marriage entry about a woman from the class of '39 (yes, you read right, marriage) and it said she and her high school sweetheart had married and were happy and had "picked up right where they left off."  i almost cried!  i aspire to be happy and in love when i'm of that age.  i'm starting to learn html!  i'm the last person on the planet who blogs and doesn't know html!  but soon, i will leave my lonely rank and join those of the learned!  however, i'm just picking it up as a dabbler, NOT as some sheisty uppity programmer.  so don't expect anything magical anytime soon.  today was so great for driving.  there is shade on the roads now even though the leaves are still young and pale green and haven't yet extended the way they will later this summer.  the world looks like a japanese watercolor to me; jaggedy and swooping lines of black, dashed with greens and pinks and dark birds swirling in the background.  i never thought i'd like spring so much.

      chapstick is best worn second-hand.  the gasoline gods defied me today!  i urged the blue-mobile to "please, just around this corner, and down those blocks, and around that curve..." and she said "-sputter-sputter- egads woman, why didn't you feed me when you had the chance?"  and so, just moments away from food, folks, and fun (and no, NOT mcdonalds) she could go no further.  i knew i was pushing my luck.  lousy woodfield!  and so  urlLink tomiboy  (see april 17) and allanman saved the day!  (after tomi laughed and laughed, having had the SAME experience).  but they came bearing fifty cents of gas.  yay!  and the blue-mobile coughed and wheezed herself to life, then said most vehemently "outta my way, other diminutive cars! this is MY road!  step aside, watch.  and learn!"  and off into the sunset we rode.  my car and i, hungry together.  i couldn't ask for a better-working relationship.  of course, she'd  totally  understand if i were to share a few drives with the honda hybrid.  i sooo didn't go to work today.  it was a moment of epiphany for me.  ah, to sleep... (perchance to dream!).  i had a moment to write plans out for the summer...  then i heard a song tonight by  urlLink appleseed cast  that put it all in perspective.  mainly about not going away again.  i still haven't bought those plane tickets to italy!  time is quickly approaching!  i have a lot of things i'm working on prioritizing.  so many adventures... so little time.  i plan on being the coolest 40 year old when all is said and done!  love spent is never, ever love wasted.

      I am Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself...   I saw spiderman 2 tonight.  woohoo midnight preview.  i thought it rocked :)  that and i finally got to hear the whole dashboard confessional song instead of just lousy clips on the radio.  do we all walk around feeling like spiderman sometimes?  living our lives and keeping things together and being "true to ourselves" and trying not to hurt or be hurt and all along feeling a rush of confusion and exhilaration and hollowness all at once?  as much as i can appreciate the complexities of the human condition, sometimes i truly do wish i were a little more like a car: simple and responsive.  i got a card in the mail today from toyota/scion.  to thank me for my purchase, they gave me a free tube of "touch-up paint."  if only my flaws could be so simple for somebody.  most of the time i have no idea how to consolidate my past with my present.  i want it to all make some sort of sense; to have some sort of reason; to blaze a trail from me then to me someday.  mostly i don't want to feel ashamed or regretful about bad things that happened or things that went wrong and i want to appreciate the things that went right, if even for a short time.  i hope that more things go right.  and i hope that i can laugh about the things that go wrong along the way.  it makes me sick to realize all the strange neurotic things that go on in my head now that weren't there 5 years ago; fears and strange obsessions and things that give me peace.  most of all i wish i didn't stay up til 4 AM typing up this crap that always comes across whinier than it feels before it gets typed.  anyway, yay spiderman!

      aggggggghhhhhhh.......  i get tired of feeling so tired!    my job this summer is so hectic.  not that it's hectic on it's own, but i spend a ton of time driving (practically to bolingbrook) and the kid i work with is in summer school... so i never really know when he's going to be there and it ends up being a lot of time waiting.  sometimes it seems like it would be so much easier to just have a job where you show up and work with some kind of prescribed ideal in mind.  oh well.  i like my job.  i'd have to say i think i'm happy right now.  although can it be possible for one to forget how to really be happy?    i played soccer on sunday and even though i wore my rugby boots and old socks, i got these monster blisters on my heels.  quarter size blisters!  i've never gotten blisters from sports in my life!  and yesterday at work they were kind of halfway healed, and my kid got upset at something and nailed me RIGHT ON THE HEEL.  talk about achilles!  THAT was crippling.  i was paralyzed for a moment.  i needed to be chasing after the kid and i just couldn't...  welp, the quest continues to fill the day up with everything... would life be as much fun without crowding it all in?

      at this very moment, somewhere in illinois, my scion is lightly covered in dew and nestled among her friends to sleep for the night.  in the morning, she will ride north.  she will get her very first full tank of gasoline and will be stripped of all the protective materials on her from the long long trip from japan.  she will get bathed.  she will get mud guards, rims, and floor mats.  she will get the cd/mp3/satellite player (standard!!).    but best of all, she will get me.  the papers tell me that she's mine.  i don't like to think of it as owning her perse... it's a balanced relationship.  i feed her and bathe her, she vrooms and shines.  love is a sleek and muscular shadow gray pearl.  :D.  many times over.

And one day in New York City baby A girl fell from the sky From the top of a burning apartment building Fourteen stories high And when her spirit left her body How it split the sun I know that she will live for ever All goes on and on and on and She goes and now she knows she'll never be afraid To watch the morning paper blow  Into a hole where no one can escape Dee, de de de de...

      i'm in love.  her name is scion.  you can also call her xA.  i don't necessarily want a new car.  my car looks so sad sitting in the driveway.  she knows i'm thinking about another car.  she knows.  the pleading headlights... the dull shine on her hood...  she's got that look.  "what about the good times?"  she asks.  "cmon, another spin?"  "I'm only a social smoker; I'll quit for you!  Just one more chance.  Please?"  I got serious about it today.  I applied for a car loan.  I've already built my car online.  Twice.  The only thing i can't decide is blue or phantom gray.  She's a non-smoker.  She doesn't drink... as much.  The shy yet aggressive vroom.  She's the short, quiet girl on the coed soccer team that just scored against the championship guy player.  Wait.  I'm crossing lines here...  Ah, committment.  I think I'm scared that if i get a new car, i lose all proof that i am capable of a long and committed relationship.  oh wait.  i still have the horse.  woo hoo!   pipe dreams.  so warm and cozy.  so easy and distracting when one ought to be working on botanical illustration.  "for the life of me, i cannot remember what made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise..."

       muddled thoughts that probably shouldn't be here...   people tell me that they think i'm constantly in thought.  i never know what to say; i'm sure my mind is somewhere but i can't always put my finger on it.  i'm bad at a lot of things that scare me.  i read a quote the other day that involved keeping one's heart from getting hurt and so they died, the heart safe and intact in the coffin.  my first thought was "hey, it worked!"  but of course i did not miss the underlying message that it's better to love and get broken, yadda yadda....  i'm bad at being in love.  it's something i try to avoid.  my thoughts tonight come from a combination of comments made from different people at different times that for some reason are in my head.  i went away for a week to help my dad bury my uncle, stand tall through taps, and support the family.  i told everyone basically not to call or email.  and i find myself back in town afraid to call anyone.  i'm not sure why.  events this week have taken an inertia all their own, and it's all i can do to drive the car in the right direction.  today i got an unexpected partial day off, and it was nice to take a nap.  i think i'm an addict to adding things into my life, although today i took a stand and told my boss that i wouldn't work any extra programs (i'm already at 40 hours!); i'm committed to having my weekends!  i want to go to more Fire games, dammit!  and soccer on sundays (and tuesdays)!  yeah!  i started with one art class and now i'm taking two, and holy cow one of them is done in 4 weeks already!  and this is me "laid back and taking time for myself."  at least I can laugh at that.  there may be nothing left of my car by the end of the summer but the steering wheel and the seat, and me behind it saying "go, dammit!  i'm running late (again)!"  recently i was asked what pain i was trying to hide from or make up for by staying so busy.  i don't know.  everything that i'm busy with is stuff i want to do; it's unfortunate that many of them require time; but i'm having fun...  less recently i was told, or rather asked, more specifically, if i thought i could ever be as close to someone as i was with him.  my reply was basically that i'd rather be by myself and with a thousand cats than be with him.  i was talking with one of my girlfriends when i was in alabama, and we were talking about our biggest fears; she summed mine up by saying "you know, we're all afraid of ending up alone."  i didn't say i was afraid of being alone.  she's the type of friend who tells me what i mean to say when i'm beating around about NOT saying.  last night after soccer i was assured that marriage would not be a problem for me.  (i have no idea how that came up; it was during a discussion of divorce wherein i thought it was unfair for women to take half of everything a man makes, especially if he owns a company or has done all the work.  marriage doesn't entitle anyone to not working, i think.)  i'm doing a damn fine job of pushing away people who threaten me with the L word.  i think that's exactly how i feel.  like it's a threat.  like, ok, you started it, now we have to take this outside to the ballfield so i can kick dust up on your shoes and we can see who's left standing.  my dad said my older sister is a hermit.  i am the anti-hermit.  but i think the end result is the same.  if i am any way at all, it's no one's fault.  everyone has a story to tell; everyone has been "hurt before"; we are all kids skidding around on concrete with bloody knees crying for the bandaids.  but lots of people have bandaids.  the trouble is the people with bandaids that don't blow on the cut before they put them on, or put alcohol on it first, or do any number of things that make you scream and wail before it's all better and healed.  and then there's scars.    maybe the trick is to find the person with the most neosporin.

      "I will love you until the day I no longer exist, and the universe is nothing but dust and all but gone, and even then I have my doubts. I will love you, all of you, forever, and never sparingly, always to the best that I can. Because you deserve that, the best.  I promise you."  thanks.  i've had a roller coaster week.  anyone who has made reference to said week as fun probably hasn't gotten a return call from me.  that said, there were moments of not-so-heavy heartedness; brief reprieve with good friends as i sought clarity by driving from memphis to birmingham for a day.  montevallo is changing; they are getting a CVS; they have torn up the streets; they have torn down barnstormers.  sort of a poetic symbolism in that i suppose... in birmingham, vulcan is alive, well, and shiny; he looms over my girlfriend's red mountain apartment (the one i always plotted to rent but never did!) and the city is whole again.  we ate at all my favorite restaurants.  well, almost all.  we talked about the wedding and all the events i'm in charge of arranging (all things involving drinking and rafting!).  harv gave me a new cd and said he was thinking of moving up north.    i spent a lot of time with my dad and family this week.  mostly i went to montevallo to spend time with my grandparents, because i haven't seen them (like my other friends down there) since february.  grandparents (even surrogate ones, like mine) are important because they keep you grounded in who you are.  and they are always happy to see you, especially when you can teach them how to use the new cell phone.  but back to my dad.  he let me have the car because he knows me, and he knows that i've been restless AND weary lately, and both of us like a good road trip.  i passed one up recently because i couldn't think of anywhere to go and didn't have the money.  i guess a funeral and staying with family is a bit different.  we went to beale st saturday night to listen to the blues and reminisce (mostly him with his memories).  my dad and i, at times, talk as friends and not as father and daughter, and i learned a lot of things, so it was a sort of emotional epiphany for me.  my dad still loves his high school sweetheart.  when he told me that i just wanted to break into a million pieces.  i'm not even that old, but some parts of my life are so tarnished and so raw that i just feel dead inside.  it just made me feel so sad.  and the song in the background was "raining in georgia."  i typed the name into my phone so that i would remember, but i didn't need to; i'm not sure i'll ever forget.  "It's a rainy night in Georgia Such a rainy night in Georgia I feel that it's raining all over the world Lord I feel like it's raining all over the world."  the bartender said i was too pretty to cry.  all i wanted to do was close out our tab.  so somehow, life up here is going to continue to be different and better.  turtle racing on friday nights.  all the art classes i'm taking.  and only working one job, because i quit starbucks in honor of my uncle.  (and because i just got a nice raise at wdsra, woo hoo!).  on a completely different sidenote, i just wanted to reiterate that i realize the self-servitude of this blogspot.  there are lots of sites with political insight and clever witticisms.  this isn't often one of those sites.  this is the only site about me.  well, the only site about what's in my head, from my perspective.  i'm not asking anyone to like it, take away some real introspective value from it, or anything else.  i like to write; i like to type; i needed something to get out what's in that melon-shaped orb on my shoulders.  so this is a fragment of that mental pulp, written mainly for my own value.  i don't hope you like it.  but i'm glad if you do.

      yesterday i watched my father make a list of all of his siblings, and then go back over the list and cross off the ones who have died.  this was so he could keep track of who to call because he had to cross off a new name.  my dad and i were talking the other day about songs and random trivia surrounding them, and amazing grace came up.  apparently the song was originally written to only be played on the black keys of a piano keyboard, so the song in and of itself is a racial protest.  i told him that the only time i'd ever seen him cry was to that song at his mother's funeral.  i'm not looking forward to another amazing grace.

      for many of us there are trying times.  we look around between clean lines and clutter, and sometimes we walk away.  time hurts and time heals.  shared apartments come and go; dreams tossed away to despair or desperation.  i think sometimes we are so lost that we can't see when we are found.  and sometimes we know we are found, but feel lost.  i have another friend moved off to los angeles.  are these signs?  3 close people already gone to LA and more to go... three amys hired all at once at my company... too much of me here and not enough of me there?  tonight is turtle racing at big joes :)  nothing like good, clean fun.  yesterday i bought that mp3 jukebox i've been eyeing.. woo hoo 40 GB of musical storage AND hard drive space!!  bang bang, i hit the ground, bang bang... my baby shot me down....

      dust in my hair, dirt under my fingernails, blisters on my hands, and a crowded brain.  and one old horseman calling me kiddo to make it all go away.  that, and he feeds me well too.  i think i am a lot of dust, and dirt, and laughter.  The World is too much with us; late and soon,    Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:    Little we see in Nature that is ours;    We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!    This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon,           The winds that will be howling at all hours    And are up-gather'd now like sleeping flowers,    For this, for everything, we are out of tune;    It moves us not.—Great God! I'd rather be    A pagan suckled in a creed outworn,—     So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,    Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;    Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;    Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.   (wordsworth, 1807)

      I'm so tired of being here Suppressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave 'Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have All of me  You used to captivate me By your resonating light Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts My once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away All the sanity in me  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along.

      yesterday i went on a bike ride in the city and kicked around a soccer ball in lincoln park.&nbsp; life should always be as simple as fresh cut grass in the rain.  a kid came up while we were eating taco fresco on the concrete at the lake, and wanted to check out the bikes and the digital camera.&nbsp; we had&nbsp;extra guacamole.&nbsp; he said he'd never had it before, but he was huuungry.&nbsp; we talked about sports; he said he liked soccer and knew soldier field.&nbsp; i was laying on the concrete basking in the clouds, and the kid laid down next to me, put his head on my shoulder, and said, "i like you."  i like the uninhibited nature of some kids.&nbsp; even shy kids, if you can figure out how to reach them or interest them, have something to say.  eventually he got up and walked away, chips and guac in hand, and seemed to disappear beyond the trees...

      you know what?&nbsp; i would seem a whole helluva lot more "social" at bars if i weren't constantly treated like "the ugly friend."&nbsp; as fortunate as it is to be blessed with good looking female friends, this has yet to rub off on me.&nbsp; the end result is half of a million guys coming up to me to ask about my hot friend, et cetera (what she's like, what music she likes, what they can to do really win her heart).&nbsp; i can't say how much i totally now hate this bar.&nbsp; and everyone says "act more sociable.&nbsp; guys need that.&nbsp; they are insecure."&nbsp; like i give a s**t about some lameass guys at some stupidass bar in the middle of nowhere chicago.&nbsp; the last guy i really liked totally blew me off and only calls me at 2:21 AM when he's drunk to ask for a ride home.&nbsp; because i'm THAT girl.&nbsp; not the one you actually want to date and hang out with, but the one you know you can count on when you're in a tough spot and need someone to bail you out.&nbsp; it sucks.&nbsp; i'm so friggin tired of&nbsp;all the "other" guys in the bar coming up (mostly because my friend is occupied) to first ask about my friend, and then ask for MY number.&nbsp; without any conversation or anything, because they are too drunk to care and just want something to show for an otherwise unproductive evening.&nbsp; the only thing i have going for me right now is a 75 year old who wants me for a mistress.&nbsp; great.&nbsp; i'm so thrilled that i've overshot my own age group.  and so i come home to the blog.&nbsp; because my mind is too angry and electric to just go to sleep, i'm here.&nbsp; my "only" other friend is safely parked in the driveway.  surely there are better things to be doing at 4 Am on a sunday then being here.&nbsp; or being at the bar, silently yet steadily growing angry and frustrated.&nbsp; i didn't think that i needed to be the center of attention.&nbsp; i don't want a mass of drunk lame guys to talk to.&nbsp; aren't there any semi-drunk non-lame guys out there with half a conversation's worth of things to say?&nbsp; or girls?&nbsp; i'm not picky.&nbsp; i just want someone to hang out with so i'm not stuck alone.&nbsp; with a scarlet L (LAME) on my chest.  this one guy kept calling me tracy.&nbsp; charming.&nbsp; over and over again, and i let it slide, because i thought it wouldn't be worth the trouble to correct this guy (who obviously wouldn't be spending too much time by us, right?)... and he proceeded to introduce my friend and&nbsp;me to his friends.&nbsp; now they're all calling me tracy.&nbsp; so i finally corrected him, nicely, and he made a huge deal about how important a name was and blah blah blah, "like man, that's who you ARE".&nbsp; whatever, dude.&nbsp; thus far my name has yet to live up to it's purported potential.&nbsp; so then i felt completely moronic because it was written all over his face that he was not actually concerned with my name but with the status of my friend.&nbsp; so i politely dissipated from the situation and found a solitary comfortable blue moon (with an orange) and pretended to be having fun.  i hate this.  can't we all just find a comfy living room and get along?

      did you know that dubya is trying already to avoid the vote in november, citing possible terrorist attacks?&nbsp; this would be the first time, like, ever that the presidential elections would be postponed.&nbsp; (does any one actually still worry about this "red alert"&nbsp; "orange alert" crap anymore?)&nbsp; -- because trust me, i'm scared. &nbsp; right. &nbsp; i think that ALONE should be some sort of message.&nbsp; if we as a society have to fear terroristic outlashings on the premise that he wins the presidency, do we really want to put him back in office?&nbsp; he never even made the presidential walk, and that had nothing to do with terrorists, but pissed off voters blocking the way with eggs and tomatoes! &nbsp; ah, the rest of america... awash in a sea of complacency... &nbsp; (for the record, no i have NOT seen F 911 yet.&nbsp; but i want to..)

       urlLink    ... still going at 3 AM...&nbsp; urlLink     the LONGEST weekend in the WORLD!!!!!  saturday/sunday morning was the LATE ride (the greatest and coolest bike ride on the planet)... most of the people i know apparently have BETTER things to do on a saturday night than pay to ride a bike through the city, but NOT me.  and not 8000 other people!  the ride was great.  last year i whooshed through it and got done around 3 or 4, but this year was the Leisure Ride.  finished up at a smooth and lazy 6 AM.  but that counts stopping to eat at ALL the stops, stopping for a sunrise check (and allowing my butt to reinflate.. lousy bike seats!), and fixing up the brakes and tire pressure (hey, it happens)...  went to "bed" around 7ish.. woke up a little later to play soccer... and set up for the double header... and eat food at the tailgate.. and drink at the tailgate.. and ponder time and existence at the tailgate.. and wonder when the games will start at the tailgate... and ... oh crap!  time to go!  two tied scores.  unbelievable!  more polish people in one place than one person should ever have to see.  (not that that's a bad thing!)  poor USA.  they just THOUGHT it was a home game :)  some of the worst referees on the planet (i'm blind, i'm deaf, i wanna be a... -you guessed it- REF!)  i'm going to personally author a defining book on offsides.  i'm calling it "hind foot."  offsides is NOT the most complex thing in the world.  i helped coach a team and that coach was like, "oh man, we can pass and shoot and score but we get more calls on offsides.  i just don't get it."  maybe it's the rugby, i don't know.  i don't think it's all that difficult...   urlLink    a labor of love...&nbsp; urlLink

      rejection nothing!  long live the ubermensch!  i got a phone call today from my boss.  actually, my boss's boss.  i'm not quite sure but i think she was offering me a new job that came open with the company.  i haven't even started the job they HIRED me for yet... and they're moving me around already?  at any rate i have to "interview" again next week.  that job would be overseeing adaptive sports and mental health... so things like wheelchair basketball and special olympic bocce ball.  it think it would be fun as hell.  not literally hell, you know ;)  anyway, i thought it was cool of her to offer the opportunity.  (see?  i am a perfectly stable, well balanced, fun loving, much sought after individual.  no rejection here!)  :P

      demotivation.  All around me are familiar faces Worn out places, worn out faces Bright and early for their daily races Going nowhere, going nowhere And their tears are filling up their glasses No expression, no expression Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow No tomorrow, no tomorrow  And I find it kind of funny I find it kind of sad The dreams in which I'm dying Are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you 'Cos I find it hard to take When people run in circles It's a very, very Mad World...  (ancient tears for fears.  revived during donnie darko and prime time tv.  thank you, roland.)  a sloth would be more active...  ok... it's not that i'm not active... but if i get a night to sit still, NOTHING gets done.  unless you count ice cream consumption as progress.  (in which case, look at all the work i got done TONIGHT!)  the brain is numb!  this is what mind-numbing means!  it's as if each day is this vast ocean of things that need to be done, that could be done, that probably wouldn't hurt to be done, et cetera ad infinitum... and more and more i find myself hitting the bare minimum.  some days i feel a lot like the kids i work with... words and topics and ideas floating around, bouncing off eachother, and finding no logical way out.  ever had something so bad and confusing happen that you are constantly fighting two simultaneous urges:  wanting to tell the whole world and get it out once and for all, or burying it for fear of total rejection from everyone?  i think my cat goes through that daily.  i'm not saying, i'm just  saying .

      sitting at home can be painful.  restlessness equals maniacally checking the email box upwards of 10 times within only a few hours.  suddenly feeling chatty on IM.  writing on the blog.  this is the ultimate in procrastination to all the things i ought to otherwise be doing:  cleaning, organizing, bike riding, marathon training, working on art projects, playing piano...............  this is a quest for carpal tunnel.  some days i still have that desire for a spotless mind.

      nicknames i have had:  little person, daughterly, liebling, bailey, cat, irish queen, petit choux, westside, little bit, squawk, liefje, cukla, mi ja, amytha, logicala.  i don't mind any of them.  social commentary is everwhere.  i hope i don't grow up into a person who hears any cover band and says "wow, great band!"  not that cover bands are bad, necessarily.  i'm talking about growing old into the person who goes to festivals in the suburbs and hears a band playing familiar oldies mixed in with modern hits... and says "wow, great band!"    i saw  urlLink murph  at the curragh several weeks ago, and he does covers to pay the bills... and he totally rocks. but he makes the songs  his  somehow; he owns the riffs and the lyrics.  he said he has his own stuff but "this crowd doesn't want to hear that!"  (except for me, but i'm just me.)  tonight was a landscape of middle america:  moderately obese, white-bread, hard-working, hoping to retire on pension one day, slightly republican...  i managed to divide the men into categories:  those who play golf, and those who think about playing golf.  guys in polo shirts versus guys in harley meet shirts or margaritaville shirts or other sleeves-cut-off shirt.  collars versus the nons.  the women were all moms in some form:  past, present, or soon-to-be...  i think for the most part the people of carol stream (or at least who were there tonight) are all right.  probably most of them are struggling to make ends meet one way or another (even the golf guys).  the fathers were dancing with their kids.  the kids were hilarious; one kid kept playing air guitar between shoving matches with his sister (who fell in the mud but didn't cry - my kind of kid!)  and not a single adult with any conteporary fashion sense.  i was the only person for at least a decade in either direction my age.  in the end, none of this matters.  the fireworks were awesome.  i didn't blink for a full 30 minutes.  i love the m80s.  and there were these new fireworks that would pop white, fade, and then all the little sparks would explode all over again - NOT like ths shooting star ones that dribble down the sky - thsee would explode while still in the form of the first explosion's circle, so it was like a million little firework exlosions held in this big smoke frame.  hard to explain.  but cool to see.  happy 4th.

      Fireworks!  I love the 4th!  Not that I've seen any yet, but today i got to march in the parade!  i didn't actually get to see the parade, which was weird... didn't hear the bands or the sirens or anything except the crowd cheering and waving and some of the women pointing at me and saying "look!  a woman infiltrated the ranks!"  For i was part of the carol stream rotary club precision shopping cart drill team, which is comprised almost entirely of 40+ year old businessmen.  and then there was me.  actually, the guy behind me was my age; he got suckered in to march by his dad like i was.  so we bonded.  so that was fun.  my dad got to do his citizen of the year thing in a sweet red convertible (with my mom at the helm).  it's weird to do the 4th on the 3rd.  but i'm not complaining; that just means two days of fireworks!

      ode to the removal of old boyfriends (or at least surpassing them, or beating their demands, or whatever evil things they want)..........  i started my new job today.  since being hired for 'A' coordinator position, i have re-interviewed twice for other positions that i was contacted about.  they hired me for day camps.  and then this morning, after interviewing for a physically handicapped/wheelchair basketball position (our team, btw, is the reigning state champs in the IHSA league for WC Bball), i got it!  so i'm doing PH sports!  and also running events for people with mental illnesses.  woo hoo!  then tonight i played indoor soccer for the first time.  it rocked.  and i almost scored.  indoor is a lot like rugby 7s i think.. fast and furious; smaller teams, shorter games, lots and lots of sweat.  so, to all you old boyfriends who thought i was fat and unmotivated, to quote good ole monty, "i fart in your general direction."  wherever that may be.
