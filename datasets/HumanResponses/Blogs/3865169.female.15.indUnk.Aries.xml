      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           CLICK ON THE TITLE~ 95% of my friends smoke, and now they are bitching about how expensive it is. about that same percent of them also smoke pot.  And if you think of it there are a lot of people who smoke pot whether it be for fun, therapy, or your religion whatever, they could make more money to help fund our goverenment if they legalized it. Or they could just legalize it totally.  I think they could have laws like anyone at a certain age and up like smoking and drinking. Even though, i don't thinkthat there needs to be a age limit on those either, put thats a whole nother post! I have smoked pot before who hasn't some people do it all the timeothers just do it occassionally, and others tried it and never have done it again. I am not saying that they should legalize pot because it can't hurt you because it can. But hey think about how much fun you could have if everything fun was legal. I know this is unclear and blurry in away. for health reasons hehehehehe RAYCHEL the good times lol. but yeah i wil clairafy later, or you can ask me certain questions on how i feel.

      OKAY  why is it that the word hott has so many definitions? Many guys have told me that they won't even talk to a girl if they aren't attracted to them, what is up with that? But to a girl if you call a guy hott its like "DAMN" wouldn't mind getting a piece of that, but see a guy doesn't need to be hott for a girl to talk to umm, but hell it does help there chance of getting any.   Another definition of the word i've heard is like they certain person hey that person is hott, lets bring them a beverage, and get to know them a little better (thats the best one)  1.) attracted to them 2.) buy/bringing them a drink (if u put a date rape drug in there u deserve to die) 3.) GETTING TO KNOW THEM!~!~!~! 4.) getting a #,email or whatever 5.) thats up to you ;)

      Okay Jeff we will be having a little chat later, and don't think you will be lucky when we meet, and if you give anyone my password I will hurt you. Okay I just changed my mind  if you want to write stuff on here that is fine with me but you may not write stuff like this unless you write it better. Yes I know that my homosexual blog wasn't very good, but I just got off the phone with Nathen, and as you may or may not know he is gay! I still LOVE you Nathen and I will stick by your side till the end.

      Okay yes I know that this is Jessica's site but when she was typing her homosexual post it got me thinking about this subject a lot more.  I mean I love 3 somes, but not all girls are into that sort of thing. WTF if they say that I think that they need to watch one and if they want they can join in but before they say"NO THANKS" I think that they should try it.  Also this is great option for girls who maybe don't want to have the chance of getting preg.  of whatever.  In all of the 3 somes I've had I have never gotten a girl that doesn't want to get preg. preg.  Also if a girl wants to stop people from saying "shes all talk" or whatever she could do this. I am sure I will delight you with more on "what jeff thinks" and her other friends will to! Jessica is going to kill me when she reads this hahahahaha, and I don't think that she can delete it cause I did this on my computer hehehehe.

      Why would anyone want to be gay, I mean I have some gay friends but they can't give me a answer.  The main answer that they give me is, "I don't like girls cause they are to much work, they are fine as friends and flirt buddies, but not as wives or girl friends.", another one that I commonly get it "because its new and different, and if your the male all the time u get tired during sex!" Yeah, that one was told to me by a 18 year old. I think that men would be crazy, and guys have to be really nuts to make this desision!  Why would and what would of crossed your mine to make you descide that you wanted the cock, do you just wake up one morning and think that to your self. To me when i see guys making out, i just think yuck, because guys are not suppose to be so emotional.  Yes I do have questions for lesbians to, did one say they just wake up and say i want fake cock from now on, or i don't want to deal with having a kid. Then they deside that hey i want a kid, but they don't think it through that the kid won't grow up with a dad, to me I think that, that would just be uncomfortable. But I don't have a problem with bi~sexual girls, i guess because sometimes its shocks people. I think that it shocks people more with bisexual girls cause when there parents find out or a pastor, there whole relationship with that person changes. But with Guy bisexuals i think that they might as well just be gay. I have such strong feelings with this because most HOTT guys are gay! i would be perfectly fine if they were ugly. There will be part to follow on this topic. I would love to know your opions so PLEASE TELL ME and keep it totally honest!!!!!

      Okay, if you are ever out with a friend and your friend gets caught shop lifting don't cover for her!!! Its her stupid fault! Thats what my friends weedo(ashley) did for her friend Amber who will get the shit beat out of her sometime soon because everyone hates her now. Now Ashley has to go to boarding school in Kentucky. grrrrrrrr this really makes me made. its just cause ashley has a good heart, even though she told me that she didn't think that Amber would cover for her. This would of been Ambers second time shop lifting if Ashley wouldn't of covered for her! Ashley covered because Amber tried to kill herself after the first time she got caught. You'd think Amber would of learned. Well Ashley is going to court today. I wish her goodluck!
