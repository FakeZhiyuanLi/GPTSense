      Some of Matt's reading classes are being held at the  urlLink Eno River Unitarian Universalist Fellowship  in Durham, and last week I happened to drop by.  Out of curiosity I slipped into the sanctuary and thumbed through their hymnal.  It was a weird collection: --Martin Luther's "A Mighty Fortress (verses 1 and 4, unedited)  --African American spirituals (likewise mostly unedited) --"For the Beauty of the Earth" and many other traditional hymns, heavily edited to remove Jesus, the Passion, patriarchal language referring to God or to humans, and any kind of specifically Christian language --a smattering of Confucian, Buddhist, and English Romantic poems set to music --a large selection of hymns in praise of nature, human aspiration, peace, justice, and/or a God and/or Goddess.   (Ironically, I did not see any hymns from the world's largest branch of Unitarianism--Islam!)  I'm very much in favor of peace and justice (and inclusive language, for that matter), but in my world those things cannot be realities without the reign of Christ--Jesus Christ, the incarnate God.    If you can tell anything about a religion from its hymnbooks, then it seems as though Unitarian Universalism is primarily a kind of denatured Christianity--people can sing the familiar tune and feel as though they're connected to historical Christianity, but without being offended by the particularity of the historical Christian message.  To me it seems very close to civil religion as described in  urlLink "Biblical Religion and Civil Religion in America" by Robert N. Bellah  (thanks to  urlLink Tim  for the link to this great article). Thomas Jefferson said he thought Unitarianism was the best religion for a democracy, and I wonder if this is what he meant.

      My brother Jon writes:  I ran across this paragraph in the book  The Conservative Mind , by Russell Kirk, which I thought you might enjoy posting for discussion on your blog.  It is an interesting thought on the difference between traditional conservatives and neo-conservatives.  The neo-conservatives adhere to the confusion that Kirk describes later in the paragraphs.  "This network of personal relationships and local decencies was brushed aside by steam, coal, the spinning jenny, the cotton gin, speedy transportation, and the other items in that catalogue of progress which school-children memorize.  The Industrial Revolution seems to have been a response of mankind to the challenge of a swelling population: 'Capitalism gave the world what it needed,' Ludwig von Mises writes sturdily in his  Human Action , 'a higher standard of living for a steadily increasing number of people.'  But it turned the world inside out.  Personal loyalties gave way to financial relationships.  The wealthy man ceased to be magistrate and patron; he ceased to be neighbor to the poor man; he became a mass-man, very often, with no purpose in life but aggrandizement.  He ceased to be conservative because he did not understand conservative norms, which cannot be instilled by mere logic -- a man must be steeped in them.  The poor man ceased to feel that he had a decent place in the community; he became a social atom, starved for most emotions except envy and ennui, severed from true family-life and reduced to mere household-life, his old landmarks buried, his old faiths dissipated.   "Industrialism was a harder knock to conservatism than the books of the French egalitarians.  To complete the rout of traditionalists, in America an impression began to arise that the new industrial and acquisitive interests are the conservative interest, that conservatism is simply a political argument in defense of large accumulations of private propery, that expansion, centralization, and accumulation are the tenets of conservatives.  From this confusion, from the popular belief that Hamilton was the founder of American conservatism, the forces of tradition in the United States never have fully escaped."  Now: discuss! I'm hoping Matt will blog about Wendell Berry soon, so hopefully we'll have some interesting cross-currents.

      Right now I'm reading  Devices and Desires , by P. D. James.  Unlike other authors, she puts a fair number of Christians in her novels, and also unlike other authors she doesn't make them into caricatures either of sanctity or of hypocrisy.  They are real people, and like real Christians they sometimes are true to their calling, and sometimes fall very hard.  The best example of this is in her  Death in Holy Orders .    Her most famous mysteries are in the  urlLink Adam Dalgliesh series , which includes both of the novels I mentioned.  Highly recommended.

      My latest find, courtesy of Sojourners, is  urlLink slacktivist , who's running a page-by-page theological and literary critique of the Left Behind series.  So far s/he's only gotten as far as page 49, but it's really interesting.  Slacktivist explains why these novels deserve a detailed critique, rather than simple mockery:  "But why take the risk at all? Why expose myself and the readers of this blog to the potentially toxic foolishness of Left Behind?  Because LB is more than simply a wretched novel. It is a wretched novel with serious consequences. It is, among other things, an assault on the central beliefs of the Christian faith..."  And, I might add, its popularity means that our Christian brothers and sisters everywhere will repeat its heresies and uncharities.  Read  urlLink slacktivist's blog  for links to other people's theological reflections--including a wonderful Mennonite's--and for such quotes as  "The thinnest ice on which a theologian can stand concerns questions about, "If you were God, who would you send to Hell?" The answer, of course, is, "I'm not God, so what're you asking me for?"   And this, which I like best of all--  "Evangelical Christianity, at its core, is radically inclusive. Evangelicals, born-againers, want everybody else to become born-again too.  Granted, this inclusivity isn't always expressed in the most winsome or persuasive manner, but it's the heart and soul of evangelicalism.   .... But that's not what one finds in Left Behind. Here you find little concern--and even less of a sense of responsibility--for the plight of the untold millions. What one finds instead is a sense of triumphalism. Those "inside the fold" feel no sense of obligation to those on the outside -- they are bad people who are getting what they deserve and the godly remnant gets to watch, more in delight than in sadness....  In Left Behind the gospel is not the good news of salvation to be shared with the untold millions. It is a secret to be treasured, hoarded and hidden under a bushel by the chosen few."

      This  urlLink online quiz  is quite amusing!  Though, unexpectedly, I am Karl Barth.        "We reject the false doctrine that the church could have permission to hand over the form  of its message and of its order to whatever it itself might wish or to the vicissitudes of the  prevailing ideological and political convictions of the day."         You are Karl Barth!  You like your freedom, and are pretty stubborn against authority! You don't  care much for other people's opinions either. You can come up with your own fun, and  often enough you have too much fun. You are pretty popular because you let people have their  way, even when you have things figured out better than them.          urlLink What theologian are you?

      Elizabeth and I tried to go on a 2-week corn syrup fast.  It's not so easy.  High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is everywhere!  We expected to give up on the Coke and candy.  But we kept finding corn syrup in the most innocent of foods:  Pickles Jelly/Jam Beef Jerky Canned Fruit Granola Bars Maraschino Cherries Lime Juice Raisin Bran Granola  Since its advent in the 1970s, High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) has eclipsed sugar consumption in the U.S.  urlLink Recent studies  show that HFCS has disastrous effects on the liver and weight gain.  HFCS is especially difficult on growing bodies. So, maybe we should give up on HFCS altogether.  But if we can't seem to avoid it for just two weeks, I don't know how we could ditch the corn syrup habit for good.

      On Sunday, Vacation Church School starts!  I'm going to be herding fourth-graders around from activity to activity;  Matt and   urlLink Tim  will contend with the third-graders, who are supposed to be a rowdy lot this year.     We're on a seven-year cycle through the Old Testament; this year it's Genesis, so we're going to start out in the Garden of Eden, thoughtfully assembled by our friend Nancy and others out of houseplants and a wading pool.  Does anyone want to place bets on how they handle Adam and Eve, pre-fall?    The best part of VCS is the song.  Father Timothy and Holden always get together and write an original song, vaguely gospelly or jazzy or bluesy, adapted to the summer's theme, and then pound away on the piano as the rest of us sing it at the top of our lungs.

      On vacation with my folks a few weeks ago, I finally gave in and read  The Da Vinci Code .  I can't believe anyone would believe the kind of bologna (are you happy, Matt?) that Dan Brown writes about Catholics in particular and Christians in general.  Real, historical, orthodox Christianity just seems so much more convincing and intelligent!  But I guess people read it for the same reason I did: because someone else was talking about it.  And then they wonder, "Was that what all the fuss was about?"  Now Dad is planning a Sunday School talk on it, and I've been thinking about how I'd do the talk, if it were me.   Though most of the Christians I know won't be thrown into a crisis of faith by reading it, it's nice to have someone else spell out why, exactly, Brown's version of Christian history is hogwash.  I've just found the New Testament scholar  urlLink Ben Witherington's review for Biblical Archeology Review  and am pleased by its clarity and patience; and  urlLink Sandra Miesel's article  has some great criticisms from a Catholic angle.     I'm tempted to make more critical comments here, but will hold off for the moment.

      Half the reviews I've read say that it's a pointed but compassionate caricature of evangelicals.  The other half say that it's neither pointed nor compassionate, and that it's not funny either.  Interestingly, the disagreement doesn't necessarily fall along the  urlLink  Christian  vs.  urlLink  non-Christian  lines you'd expect.  So who's right?     If you've seen it, share the wisdom!  Matt and Beth don't have $12 to spend on a bad movie...

      During Lent Matt and I had a conversation with one of our priests, Dan Hall (who incidentally got married a couple of hours ago), about organ transplants.  Dan said that he had some serious doubts about organ transplantation because of the way that it cut up human bodies--which to him suggested a profound disrespect for the resurrection of the dead.   At the time I thought that position was a little extreme, but  urlLink this article on organ trafficking in Mozambique  is making me rethink what he said.    Note the role Israel is playing in the organ trafficking business--and, in contrast, the role of Christian women in making this horror known to Christians (at first I wrote, "known to the West," but then I realized that the market for these organs IS the West).

      So we drove down to Goldsboro yesterday to buy a cup of coffee from the Renches; it took an hour and 50 minutes, but when we got there Marcus, Holly, and Libby invited us into their itty-bitty kiosk and cheerfully plied us with sample cups full of coffee concoctions and syrups.  I didn’t know you COULD be that happy after 18 hours in a space 10 feet by 12 feet.    Then we got in the truck and headed back toward home.  Two miles down the highway, Matt said, “I feel as though we should do something else, since we’ve driven this far.”  So we turned around and headed southeast again; two hours later we were in Morehead City, NC, where we got a motel room five minutes’ walk from the beach.    Of course, we didn’t have swimsuits, a change of clothes, or even our toothbrushes—but that really made it all the better.  Have you ever swum in the ocean in the middle of the night with your clothes on?    We took another brief walk on the beach this morning before returning.  On the way back we visited an AME Zion church in New Bern—the oldest AME Zion church in NC!—and visited one of the many Bojangles’ Chicken (about one every ten miles, it seemed).  And of course, we stopped in Goldsboro and got another cup of coffee…

      After two years of false starts and frustration, the Rench family has finally opened their  urlLink drive-thru espresso shop  in Goldsboro, NC.  They're actually serving customers coffee.

      We're getting what's left of the Texas and Louisiana storms today: steady drizzle shading to downpour.    Walking from the bus stop today, I heard the most beautiful sound: millions of drops hitting the leaves overhead, then my raincoat and the ground, in this kind of wave of gentle, familiar noise.  I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't had Matt's CD player and a library book in my (non-waterproofed) bag... at that moment I just wanted to get out of the rain to save my possessions from the wet.    I know there's a thought in here somewhere but can't locate it yet.

      Recently an interviewer from the National Catholic Reporter questioned Bishop N. T. Wright on homosexuality and the Anglican crisis.  Read the  urlLink whole interview , but below is his position that third world debt, not abortion is the big moral issue of our day:   I suspect one response would be that abortion is the defining moral issue of our times. If we can't protect unborn life, this argument runs, we can't protect anyone or anything.  This is where I really would get quite angry with that point of view. Though I happen to agree with the stance on abortion, it seems blindingly obvious that it is not the big moral issue of our time. Global debt and the economic systems that were set up in 1944 with the Breton Woods Agreement, to slope the table so the money slides into the pockets of the Western banking system, at the cost of keeping most of the world in unpayable debt, seems to me as big a moral issue as slavery was 200 years ago. I and others intend to bang on about it until we achieve something. I just don't think we can say, "abortion is the issue." Apart from anything else, there are millions of children being born all the time in Africa, in Latin America, on the Indian subcontinent, whose economic circumstances are such that it would almost be better if they hadn't been born. The reason they're in those economic situations are precisely because of decisions taken in the World Bank and the IMF, and they are structural decisions, not just particular decisions. This has been so intensively and extensively studied, people have shown it so often, that I just wonder what kind of blindness it is that prevents people from seeing it. Of course part of the answer is, our churches have endowments. We've got investments in these things, and you can't tell us to go back on that. That's a serious problem, but it's a problem that's got to be addressed. Yes, abortion matters, but all this matters much, much more. Just in terms of sheer quantity, there are millions more people whose lives are totally blighted by it. That's where I would go for starters. To play around with your Democratic presidential candidate, for example, seems to me to play with one particular pawn without noticing what's happening on the chessboard as a whole. When you see the whole, I think you have to say, let's try to address the big issues. If you haven't got the courage to do that, addressing the little issues of one particular person and his views on this or that looks like a displacement activity. It looks like something you do rather frantically in order to avoid having to talk about the elephant in the living room.

      Here is the  urlLink interview with Rowan Williams  I mentioned earlier.  I've heard him grumbled about by lots of Anglicans on my side of the hue and cry, but I think that's a little hasty.    He says, "Something that one theologian said, 50 years ago, that the Christian is always a bad political ally, because you don't know quite when you're going to run into some point of reference, some standard which doesn't just come from the general cultural consensus."  Would our own presiding bishop Griswold say that kind of thing?      Notice also that +Cantuar loves Bach and Dostoevsky, always a good sign--  Just so you know, almost every Anglican link that's posted comes from Todd Granger.  See below for details.

      Last Thursday Matt and I went to an outdoor screening of  urlLink  Notorious  (1946) , the Hitchcock  noir  thriller.  Does anyone else think that Nicole Kidman is an Ingrid Bergman lookalike?    I thought Bergman was fantastic--I'm sure my students will all think she's an evil femme fatale (and have a hard time explaining why she's working for the good guys), but I loved the way her character developed from a stereotypical movie-drunk to the almost tragic heroine we see at the end of the film.    My only complaint was that they had to stop the film three times to change reels... invariably as the suspense was building.

      Todd Granger keeps track of developments in the Anglican Communion at his blog,  urlLink the confessing reader .  You can't find a better source for news and thoughtful theological commentary.    At the moment I'm fascinated by recent interviews with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, who doesn't fall easily on either of the sides of the conservative/liberal split in the Communion--or maybe more accurately, is able to take seriously the most pressing critiques of theological revisionists without letting go of his own orthodoxy.       urlLink N.

      It's only this summer that I've missed having a TV, and even now it's not really because I want to watch  urlLink Amish in the City .&nbsp;&nbsp; What I really want is to sit down, stop thinking,&nbsp;and watch a movie--preferably the last two  Lord of the Rings  movies again,&nbsp;but I'd settle for the BBC  Pride and Prejudice, &nbsp;or  Star Wars , or&nbsp;some other movie with&nbsp;costumes, scenery&nbsp;and&nbsp;a&nbsp;brave heroine.

It's easy to use; you can google your own email if you're looking for something in particular; it has these things called "labels," which are like folders except you can put more than one label on each email (for handy cross-referencing); and it sorts email exchanges into "conversations."

I've just joined, in hopes of getting rid of this huge beige recliner that my mom dug out of someone's trash just before I came to grad school.

      One highlight from the  urlLink interview , which is worth reading in full (and then maybe going and buying the book?):  "The Catholic thinkers have a hard time wrapping their heads around the whole question of headship because they keep focusing on the issue of indissolubility: What does it mean to become one flesh in a way that can't be broken? When that's your basic framework it becomes hard to think about headship in a deep way, because if you are really one flesh, can you really talk about your shoulders being subordinate to your stomach, or can you talk about treating your liver the way you would like it to be treated? The principal intellectual distinctions come from that framing."

      When I first read the&nbsp;headline about&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink the man who hit his girlfriend with a three-foot alligator , I thought it was funny.&nbsp; Conceptually it has a kind of dada quality that's amusing.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But, reading the actual story, I began to think about other&nbsp;news stories I've read in the last month: stories about a&nbsp; urlLink missing woman ;  urlLink a woman and children set on fire ;  urlLink the recent capture of a man accused of killing two former girlfriends ; and a  urlLink man who shot his ex-wife and two kids  .&nbsp; Is it just the time of year when ongoing domestic violence becomes fatal?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Abba Poemen said of Abba John the Dwarf that he had prayed God to take his passions away from him so that he might become free from care. He went and told an old man this; 'I find myself in peace, without an enemy,' he said. The old man said to him, 'Go beseech God to stir up warfare so that you may regain the affliction and humility that you used to have, for it is by warefare that the soul makes progress.' So he besought God and when warfare came, he no longer prayed that it might be taken away, but said, 'Lord, give me strength for the fight.'  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      This may seem like I'm dragging out the Ph.D., but I don't think it will actually slow me down:  Instead of taking all 4 Ph.D. Exams in October, I am splitting them up.   2 exams (colonial and 19th century) in October 2 exams (20th century and religion) in March.   So expect me to go ABD (all but dissertation) in March or April of 2005.  This will give me more time to work on preliminary dissertation work, grant writing, and conference papers.  So, when I finally go ABD, I should be farther along on my dissertation.  And now it just occurred to me that this change in schedule matters to none and makes sense to few.

      They're now filming  urlLink "The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe"  in New Zealand!  I know that this has been a rumor for a while, but they now have  urlLink actual actors  and are trying to get  urlLink reindeer  for the White Witch's sledge.    This has got to be prompted by the immense success of  Lord of the Rings  and the Harry Potter films.  Any guesses on how faithful the Narnia movie will be to the books?

      My current favorites:  1.  urlLink Online mahJongg solitaire .    2.  urlLink J. K. Rowling's official website , which has "Easter Eggs," hidden clues and tasks, hidden all over the various sections.  Especially useful as a stopgap measure if you're on tenterhooks waiting for book 6,  Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince .    3.  Reading something else (which will give you the look and feeling of being studious, without the drudgery of actually reading  Carmina Cantabrigiensia  or whatever.    4.  Cleaning house.  5.  Ebay.

      It's everything everyone has said it is, both good and bad.  It's powerful: you'll (probably) leave the theater with some serious doubts about our current administration's methods and motivations.  But the movie is also propaganda, advancing an argument that's emotional rather than logically consistent, and void of any other point of view.  I'd say go see it, then read  urlLink Christopher Hitchens's review of the movie .  July 14, 2004** EDIT  Or read the review, then go see it.

      Today a group of medievalists are going to see  urlLink  King Arthur  , which promises to be big, heroic, and slightly inane.  Lots of  urlLink reviewers  are giving it mixed ratings, but that's okay.  It's a summer movie, so how much can we expect?  If it's any good, I'll tell you.    ******** Monday, July 12, 2004  Well, it was everything I expected it to be--which I guess wasn't much.  It mostly abandoned the traditional Arthurian plotlines.  One interesting battle scene, and another that went on far too long; not much blood or flesh; nice scenery; a total disregard for early British history.  Apparently Britain was never conquered by the Angles and Saxons, which means we should be speaking Welsh rather than English.  But at least I can take Old English off my exam reading list...  One interesting thing was that Arthur was a Christian--they showed him praying once or twice, and one plot twist depended on his feeling Christian mercy rather than self-interest.  Unusual.  But he was also a follower of Pelagius.  I'm not sure what to make of this plot twist--of course a Hollywood movie couldn't have a long discussion of theology, but it was an intriguing moment in an otherwise fairly standard movie.

      Listening to recent editions of  urlLink Mars Hill Audio Journal  has caused me to reflect on how Christians should think about space.  Do zoning laws (which force or encourage us to put our shopping on one side of town, business on another, ballparks off in the boonies, and houses further and further away from the center of town) make it harder for us to love our neighbors?  Strip malls and parking lots are ugly -- but are they unkind?  Eric O. Jacobsen argues that our physical space and urban planning is unloving to people who cannot drive.  The elderly who (in towns and cities) used to be able to walk down the street to visit neighbors, pick up groceries, or fill prescriptions, are now stranded in their homes, isolated from the rest of the world.  Poor people who are unable to buy or fix a car must face 8 lane highways to get to park.  Because we care so much about stable property values, we have refused to allow ballparks in our neighborhoods.  We pass ordinances to keep pharmacies and grocery stores in the business sections of town.  And meanwhile we are enslaving ourselves to fossil fuels.  How much gas, money, and foreign policy horrors could be saved by making our environment walkable?  How many more people could we love?  How would community be different?  As I try to figure out the answers to these questions, I'll be looking at     Sidewalks in the Kingdom: New Urbanism and the Christian Faith  by Eric O. Jacobsen and James Howard  urlLink Kunstler 's  City in the Mind:Notes on the Urban Condition  and  Geography of Nowhere  [though he seems a bit shrill].

      So obviously I have not been posting lately.  A few reasons why  Teaching -- all day, on my feet, nowhere near a computer, loads of kids, loving it.   Working -- at the Center for the Study of the American South and studying for exams.   Elizabeth's Birthday -- My wife just turned log(base 2)67,108,864.  So I had to run around getting presents, cards, and taking her to dinner and ice cream.  She's worth every second.   I'm still busy.  But in the meanwhile, check out the new pictures on the  urlLink Nieces  page.  And expect a post from me soon on Christians and the urban environment.  I'd like to start a book group (long distance) with some of you on Environmentalism and the Christian Faith.  Until then  -

      Augustine in all shapes and sizes-- urlLink The Confessions , for my exams;  urlLink St Augustine on Marriage and Sexuality , as a kind of tangent off that; and  urlLink Peter Brown's classic biography of Augustine , an awesome birthday present from my brother.  (Hopefully we'll soon be able to show you one of the other cool birthday presents I received...)  What's striking to me in all these books is Augustine's attitude toward sex.  It's really clear that he thinks that celibacy is the highest good.  He affirms the holiness of marriage, but says that sex should be used only for procreation.  Quoting Paul, he says that marriage is good, but that celibacy is better.  And when you read him, you get the very strong impression that he thinks celibacy is much, MUCH better.     This is worlds away from any modern teaching I've ever heard.  Following Luther, early Protestants affirmed marriage and abolished monastic vows in order to distinguish themselves from pre-Reformation Catholicism.  More recently, both Catholic and Protestant Christians have tried to combat our culture's emphasis on (not to say obsession with) unrestrained sex by affirming marriage as the only right and good context for sexual activity.    Well, I'm all for marriage (and have been for more than six months now)!  But what about Christians who never marry, for one reason or another?  What is their role in the Church?  To identify Christian life with "family values"--or even with the fullness of Christian motherhood and fatherhood--leaves celibates high and dry.  It implies that every Christian’s calling is to marriage and parenthood; few are paying attention to adult women and men who do not fit these roles.  To "single" Christians it must seem as though they are incomplete-—that they can’t be complete Christian men and women until they are married.  This message is not intentional on the church’s part; but it is there.     My question is this: can Protestants think of celibacy as anything other than a temporary condition, to end when (never  if ) the Christian marries?    How can a Christian be a lifelong celibate and fulfill his identity as a Christian man or woman?  How can we honor the celibates among us as much as we honor the mothers and fathers?    If celibacy is what Augustine suggests that it is, then those who are celibate--and those who surround them--need to have as much theological and practical teaching about a celibate way of life as we do about marriage.  And that means details: what is their function in the church?  How should they conduct their daily lives?  And how can they cope in a godly way with long-term loneliness and childlessness?   For one interesting take on this, see, as usual,  urlLink David Morrison's thoughts , hopefully the first in a series.  But Morrison is Catholic.  I suspect that we won't be able to answer the question without being taught by the Catholics, maybe in ways we won't like.

      Lots of things make me love living where we do.  One of them is having our own laundry line and hanging all our clean clothes out to dry.  Maybe it's because all our clothes look different hanging from a line than they do in the closet.  I look at my jeans, or a shirt of Matt's, and think, "That actually looks cool."  Maybe it's because I'm harnessing the awesome power of the sun to do my bidding.    Maybe it's because I'm saving seventy-five cents.

      Ever since I handed Matt  urlLink Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , he hasn't stopped reading.  He's on the second one now, with no sign of stopping yet.  I'm a little concerned about his exams.      Of course, I finished  urlLink Lord of the Rings  yesterday morning at 2 AM, so maybe I'm not the one to talk.

      I'm just lifting  urlLink the link to this essay  from  urlLink David Morrison's blog , which is worth reading regularly.    If you haven't read Flannery O'Connor's short stories, they are fantastic: a Catholic Southerner reflecting on sin, grace, and self-delusion.  She's hard on her characters, but merciful too.

      My high school friend Pat Liddell is coming to town soon. I haven't seen him for almost five years. Since then he has acquired tattooes on his  urlLink right  and  urlLink left  arms. But these aren't your typical mermaids, anchors, and "MOM"s--they're designs from paintings by Picasso.  Mom and Dad remember him as a mild-mannered musician, gentle --kind of like Clark Kent with a trombone. They were horrified when I told them about Pat's recent body modifications. To them, tattooing means ill-advised, permanent, inescapable self-disfiguration. But as an English major, I can't think of tattooes without thinking of Ray Bradbury's  urlLink The Illustrated Man  and Flannery O'Connor's almost perfect  urlLink short story , "Parker's Back."

      At Kristen's shower, we ate off paper plates printed with a pastel Noah's Ark full of cute animals, and the motto, "A baby is a little piece of heaven."  Any suggestions about the theology that gives rise to such paper plates?

      The schedule finally arrived for the conference on Slavery, Racism, and the Christian Church, to be held at Baylor University.  I'm presenting Saturday morning.  But what I'm most excited about is that Albert Raboteau is speaking.  He's about the best example out there on how to be a Christian scholar.   The whole conference, in fact, is my kind of event.   urlLink Check it out.
