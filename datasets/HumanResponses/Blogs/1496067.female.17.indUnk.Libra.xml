      this was meant to be an unserious comment on the time of year but I notice that it is getting close to the month of july. our brains are extensively fascinating subjects. and so it was said that when the last of the green green grass eaters did come, they should bring with them their freedom. so true as I sit on my desert island, sipping my coctail and looking out onto the deep almost blue sea, the wind is whipping gently at my shirtsleeves as the dun dances on the rim of the world and the heat of it has left my little corner of the world. goosepimples. it is a time for gentle reflection, though least likely coming from my brain. why should we wish to die? this is something from hamlet that I cannot empathise with. for those who need it, that famous speech, the beginning of which is almost unutterable, so cliched it has become, continues: ...that is the question whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and, by opposing, end them. to die. to sleep... no more. and by sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that death is heir to. 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. to die, to sleep, perchance to dream. aye, there's the rub, for what dreams will come when one has suffled off this mortal coil must give us pause. there's the respect that makes calamity of so long life. for who would bear the whips and scorns of time, t'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumley, the pangs of despised love, the law's delay, the insolence of office... but for the fear of something after death... that undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns...and we would rather bear those ills we have than face others that we know not of. [apologies to purists. this is only a rough gist thrown together from my memory] my point is, this suggest that we're all desperate to top ourselves, but will not because of this undiscovered country and its new and scary experiences that lay in wait for us, but why? why should we want to kill ourselves? not everyone is that depressed (though it's a wonder if you look at the world) and anway, that country will be there if we try and get there today or if we wait another sixty years, we're all headed that way so why not enjoy the ride. if we should have to bear these ills we have for fear of having more, why not take these joys we have rather than facing these ills. at least we know that there are joys in this world why nottake them while we can, those ills we know not of will still be there for us afterwards but we should be happier to face them. and if they are not ills, then we have lost nothing and will have made the most of this stage of our life and then can of the next one. why be inpatient? why kill yourself because your father won't let you be an actor? RUN AWAY and do what you want. that country is closing on you fast, so swim against the boat and play with the dolphins till you get there. this is, of course, not questioning that there is a country, something that i an unsure of. shakespeare, what did he know eh? pessemist? to whom are ou referring? well, the sun has gone and the wind is chill. I think I'll get back into the warm. darkness and heavy rainfall, my favourite

      well  bonjour  a land of high fantasy I'm sure. and those who are 'in the know'should know that this is a twelfth night quote. there seemed little hope of geting anthing goos, with illyria gone and twelfthnight gone and feste not gone but I couldn't have it. this will most likely be a short lived site devoted to those wonders in life that purge the air of pestulance. enjoy.

      I've never realised how much excercise playgrounds are. (nor has charlotte, who will probably be telling these exact same sentiments in her soon to be created blogger. i'd just like to say - ha. i got there first) Having had a listening music exam in the morning which lasted less than two hours, i had the afternoon free so we (charl and i) decided to go to the park in loandovery. (notes for strangers: charlotte... some person , llandovery... a town. enough detail?) and went on the swings and some other things. It is widely aknowledged that swinging requires long flowing dresses and pretty sunlight flowing gracefully through high leafy treetops, that are far too leafy to let that aomunt of sunlight through and ... tacky looking sets and leaves that look like they're made of fabric because they are.... but anyway, pretty flowing dresses are essential. and i like having long flowing hair so when you go low on the swing you can get lots of stuff stuck in it and have to brush it out, like twigs, then a spare cigerette but sets it on fire and you get a whole new look is life not fun...

      revision: don't you hate it. today i have watched some complete rubbish on the television in volving an old version of some film to do with the nights of the round table which had definate pre-echoes of the monty python film. they must have watched it. probably avioding doing any work. the worst thing is is then, whatever i do i keep thinking i should be revising and i have enough permanent guilt as it is. i just can not revise at certain times. it was almost physically impossible for me to get up and do some work. is it because i roughly know everything already or because there is not enough pressure. proberly the latter but with a day to go before the first exam it seems odd. i think my main problem is, and it i going to be hard to explain without sounding snobbish, this: i like praise for hard work and i feel the best sort of praise is when it comes from surprise, i.e. 'gosh that WAS good, well done" rather than the "I'm not surprised". i know that everyone is expecting me to do very well, certain people expecting A*s all round, which i hate because i don't think i can live up to those kinds of expectations. i know that if i do, all anyone will say is "oh, i'm not surprised" and if i don't they'll say "oh dear..." i'm not trying to get sympathy, and i know it's an awful lot harder if you have to work very hard to get a C or below. i will or should get complaints for saying this, but the thing is, weather it's true or not, it's how i see things which is what effects me. also i have been told that i should be doing the exams or myself not othe people, but i think that i've got similar feelings to 'other peolpe' ie. if i do well i won't be too surprised (no snobbery intended) but if i don't i won't be happy. all the conclusions i can draw from this is that i really do hate revision and i will spend the next five weeks, as well as for several weeks afterwards, feeling immensely guilty that i am not/have not/ did not do enough revision oh dear i think i am a lost cause and am also incredibly selfish dedicationg whole posts on my own blogger about myself. more interesting fantasies next time perhaps, or a description of my exam days. i would post my 2,600 word report about my second to last day of school but there's a danger that people from school would read it....

      This will never be as good as the first. Anyway. Hello my very own blogger. As this was an impulse thing I have nothing planned to say and starting this just before the middle of my life threatening exams is not a good plan but perhaps it will prove to be a mindless piece of escapism. For any strangers (though I’m not expecting strangers to read this) a quick introduction: Name: Emily Address: Not telling you That’s enough now on to the writing. It’s night time. Justifiably by now I think, as it’s now 20 past 11. When I started the first version it was ten to. I can never work out when night starts and ends as if guests come over ‘for the evening’ they can stay tilll at least ten or eleven o clock pm. But doesn’t the morning start after midnight as in 1am? I hope so as starting the day in the night seems a strangely depressing metaphor.  But then again I do love night. Twilight in particular as it is the time when it is dark enough to render familiar landscapes almost unrecognisable but not too dark to see. The nicest time is when it’s just dusk and the dew is starting to form on the grass and it sticks to your socks. Last week I had a really lovely evening out in the rain. First I will set the scene: I live in the country, over the road from our field. It has a baby orchard and teenage forest as well as a resident forest that has been there for many years and runs alongside the river bran, but never wins. The bran is quite big and is always changing, almost from day to day.  Anyway that day I was walking around and getting very wet in the rain and it was a really gorgeous feeling. It was only just raining but not too little to be called drizzle which I feel is a sort of onomatopea, as drizzle is so weak and frankly pointless. It won’t get you suitably wet but is not dry. Everything was green, even the air and the birds were happily swearing at each other in the trees. The trees were also raining but were doing it in the way that trees usually do which makes them seem a bit slower than the rain as they drop their collected water in chinks. They seem to have missed the idea that rain is supposed to fall evenly and try to do it in the most conservative and energy and time saving way possible by dropping large drops with lots of water in in one place. This means that the drip spends as little time in the air as possible. Very logical, but then I’ve always said that about trees, they’re very logical but have no sense of romance. Which is odd since so many of them live in such close-knit communities.  Also have you noticed how rain only feels really cold when you go inside into the warm houses. We are so lucky now that we have the benefit of warm houses and appliances that tell us how bad nature is and that we do not need it. Nuts to them, as they say. The spring is a really lovely time of year I think and when I die I’d like it to be in the spring if possible as there is so much new life around. I actually prefer the autumn but that’s just me and my rain obsession I think. I like it a lot. Unnaturally I think as most people seem to hate it and can get depressed but I think we all need a good flood now and then. Within reason of course. As long as you can control it it’s ok but if you let it get out of control it can cost you £thousands a day, so just be careful you don’t get addicted. Perhaps I’ll rant about autumn some other time. It’s now half eleven and I’ll have to spell check this before posting it.  I’m afraid not all my posts will be as interesting or imaginative as this, mostly as 1. I have little time at the moment and 2. I am rarely in a creative mood. Just for a little publicity in a new blogger please go to:  www.phpbb.uklinux.net/phpBB2   www.welcometothedesertofthereal.blogspot.com  and www.childsend.blogspot.com  well, if you want to. The first is the most understandable I think.

      Dragons… I had a dream once as I was falling asleep to radio three.. it had really nice sort of spooky music in it.. and there were these small purple dragons in our field, like baby lambs in the dew on the grass, and I just saw the word ‘dragons and remembered it. (mental note… add dragons to ‘ffion’ if I ever get any further) heh..,  So, yes I think I will paint a picture:  A gentle woodland scene with green light cascading through  leaves, high on the poley trees. Straggly grass and broken branches in patterns on the ground echoing the patterns from the shade of the leaves. With the gentle breathing of dragons in the distance, like an exhalation from the earth itself and the light steam from their bodies rising slowly through the trees, while the young ones cry out to on another running happily through the slowly-dusking forest, weak necks bending with each leap. Wings too small to lift them they scamper between trees with happy puffs of smoke and bitten tails…  Humm. Oh dear, what am I thinking…

      there have been lots of things i've meant to say but have too much to do to say them (it's always the way isn;t it) we had a PI round our house the other day. i'm not sure why and will not say what i think for random legal reasons, and there was also a person who shot himself in nearby village llangadog... not long ago there was another shooting ther. a nearby [unnamed] family is living out a soap opera and not only do we have our phone tapped and emails read, we had a man from special branch round the other day.well several weeks ago now but still.. he did come to see us aswell, not looking for directions, but then our life is full of these wonderfully random particles of excitement. exams should always be time for a good laugh. i think in nearly every GCSE exam i've had so far i've found something to laugh at. in RE it was remembering an Eddie Izzard stand up joke bit about God, Jesus , the holy ghost and scooby doo: something along the lines of god saying to Jesus: the holy ghost's gone weird, wearing a sheet over his heas. holy ghost: woooo holy host holy ghost! etc. then: i would have succeded if it wern't for those pesky god and jesus fellas. (it is actually funny, just doesn't work on screen). tech it was my stupidly bad answers. but the best was english with my description of a milk bottle: "icy and slippery as a fish" nice eh? you can just see the nobel prize for literature heading my way in the not too distant future can't you. that't the troub;e. i know i've probably written the best thing i will ever do, so i feel a bit lost with writing at the mo. that;s the problem with people and high expectations. i think i will have to stop writing publically so that people won't expect stuff to get better. thogh i have got a really nice story lined up, about an old man, a young girl and a car acciden. and some others too. they will never get off the ground though, not while low self esteem and self doubt are rife!! life is such  fun  (i do actually mean that, but i'm not sure why) this is moonbright.blogspot it's past midnight it's goodnight from kevin goodnight from fred and it;s goodnight frome me: goonight!

      ok so i got bored with writing everything that happened down properly for the blog (though i recoreded most of the week) but just take the rest as: it was a bloody fantastic week, especially all of it.  Quick thought: What i said before about being part of something is still true. but tha best is when you become engulfed in things, so that one particular thing becomes your life for a while.  love that. when you can forget about the rest of the world and just concentrate on doing whatever it is (can any of you aspiring-sherlock-holmeses connect this to anthing that i may have been doing over the last, oh, let's say, week..?) and just be doing it. it's fantastic. forget about guilt and everything. just16 hours a day of pleasure then sleep. it works for me. except when it ends and you get a terrible empty feeling and that you should be doing something. but you can't (at leas not get that bloody saxophone to sound any good at all.  how can i love the damn thing when i'm so bad at playing!) sigh. i can almost say that i don't remember being so happy for such a long time all at once s i did last week, though i am trying to only remember the good bits. sigh oh well... think of... last week.. everything... sigh

      Right, no more ramblings for now, this will be the diary of the Aberystwyth music fest, in which I am playing saxophone (alto) The first day was Saturday, comprising of a welcome meeting, buffet and the first concrt. As far as I can tell, the idea of this whole thing is to invite good musicians to Aber. And make them play, then, since they’re not doing anything for much of the day, they might as well teaach some people while they’re at it. I was alone for the talk because I know no one there and couldn’t think of a reason for approaching anyone. the talk was quick enough though, and mainly consisted of everyone being introdauced (the teachers and players that is, not the learners) and people saying “I haven’t got a lot to say really) then as the buffet started I met a swiss girl (19), in England for her gap-year and in wales for the course. She is a cellist and wants to do medicine, she had already met frances, a 17 year old oboe player and theresa, a 14 year old clarinetist about to do grade 8. Both are from England. They’re all very nice people, but they do know rather too much about classical music for my taste, though theresa also knows jazz which is nice, and not too much either so we’re about equal there which is also nice, thuiogh she’s more interested in clarinets and I in saxophones ,but that’s no matter. Then was the concert, wich was interesting, but nothing special. It’s not very good, but I just can’t ge excited about classical music as others seem to, my mind just wanders, but I plan to go to all the concerts as they are free and it will be good for me. The second half of the concert was good though as it was some famous string quartet playing with four other players, and the cellist of the quartet and a double-bass player who had joined kept looking at each other and laughing all the time, but never missed a note, and that was really nice, as the whole audience noticed and they all enjoyed it all the more for it. Next mrning we were meant to be in the AAC (aber. Arts centre) foyer by 9 am to start practice at 9.15. first I met Catherine, who plays tenor, alto and soprano sax (thouhg she’s rather taken with gerry’s barritone sax now), and lives in mid-Wales somewhre. Then was caroline who’s really nice and is about 26 from what I gather and is a music teacher in Kent, as is Stewart and Paul. Paul is a little over-confident in things and when I heard he was a teacher I thought it would be games (he’s hat kind of person) but he said music. Later though he said “I also coach sports part-time” so that’s allright. There are 7 of us all together. The other two are Sorca (sorsha pronounced) who is 14, in year 10 in aberystwyth. she has been playing the sax 2 to 3 years and is on grade 5, thuogh seems better tha I am, and nicola, a buisness consultant somewhere in England and has just taken some really high exam in saxophone… on Saturday in fact. They’re all rather good players (apart from sorca, grade 8 and above standard) and while I can generally keep up, it’s experience I’m lacking so there are things I should know but don’t, but more on that later. we waited for a while, and Gerry, out tutour came and said “we’re in pen-y-bryn” (he’s irish so actually hye said “pen-ee-bryn, though now we know it’s really just pen bryn). At that point nicola and stewart had not yet arrived, and so catherine and paul went off to find them and we caroline and I stayed in the foyer in case they turned upp there, gerry went to sort out pen bryn for us. He returned soon after saying that the porter wouldn’t let him in, though the fest had booked, the porter didn’t know. We couldn’t find anyone, it being before 10am on a Sunday, so we had to wait a long tmie. Then gerry found a man in a blue t shirt (AAC uniform) and asked him. He said go to the great hall (where concerts are) but you might get thrown out, so we had to check it wasn’t booked then finally went in and started playing it was now five to ten and gerry was not pleased because he doesn’;t like to waste time, which is geat because it means he is nothing like mrs. Rowberry when teaching and conducting. We played through some pieces which were ok though nothing I adored playing (swinging shepard blues is a lovely piece bit I was stuck on alto 3 so had little nice jazzy things to play). Surprisingly, most of the others are  classical players whiich means of course that they know all about styles and things, though I’m not too sure about sorca. Anyway that went OK, but after lunch we were meant to go down to the Olc College for wind-band practice. This is a long way from AAC and there are odd one-way systems in Aber, so Nicola and Carolinj were fnie because they were in a car with me, and I think that catherine and stewart were following but paul got lost (hah). Sorca gets lifts with her dad so she’s ok. First it was lunch time, and there was a lunch time talk about the psychology of performing, and that was great. Asically she said that you should think you’re good and the audience will too. I am pleased to learn this as an ex-theatre director, Jacky told me to always be a little under-confident, while drama teacher Miss Eliss said be confident and I was unsure which to believe. I’m glad it was miss Eliss that was right, and ha to jackie who’s got it stupidly wrong. Hen we had wind band, which was odd. For one thing it was back to front. In intermediate wind band which I play in in carms. If you face the front, the clarinets are on your right and flues on your left, but in this the flutes were on the right. I asked nicola about this and she said that the flutes were always on the right. I shall have to tlk to mrs. R. about this, though she is left-handed so perhaps that means something. I shall see what senior wind band is like next year too. There are a great many things I will have to say to mrs. R. in september, and it’ only the first day now. Afyer wnid band we were supposed to have ½ an hours break, but as the wind band over ran its time, and we had several saxophones to get back to the car (sorca and I are the only ones with one sax, the rest have 2 or more. Sorca is getting a £1000 clarniet any day now, and may get a sop sax. It’s obviously a course for rich people). And we had to drive back up to AAC so by the time we got there it was time to start playing again. To explain briefly: there are several groups in the fet: main orchestra, strings and wind, who all play in the Old College on the sea-front, while the Saxes, composers and brass play in AAC, meaning that the brass and saxes have to go into the town and back evry day to get to wind band. Our next practice was in “the chapel” a section of AAC. We had a 2 hour session there (4-6), durng which time I learned that I’d never played the sax properly. Apparently you’re meant to puit your teeth on the top of the mouthpiece, and I’, still not sure if teeth are meant to touch the reed as well. I realised how little basic things I’ve learned as most of what I do I made up. I have had no corrections before so I assumed that I was doing it right. This is mainly due to the fact that Mr. Williams started me on grade 4, though for the first week I’d played before my lesson I was playing with the mouthpiece upside-down, so he should have realised how little I knew about these things, and now I’m unsure if anything else I’m doing is wrong. It doesn’t help that mrs R. doesn’t play the sax properly.  I will have words with her. There was a concert in the evening, nothing outstanding, though I dodn’t know an oboe could play that fast. Hopefully more tomorrow, but I ma be just too tired. It is extermely hard work and even many good players are shattered. It will be a hard week

      hmmm. everyone seems to have links on their blogs now. all the more reason for me not to and then i can pretend that it's that and not just that i can't work out how to (i;m sure i could if i tried). I#ve decided my problem is i want excitement in life, but not enough excitement to make it happen. for instance i walked through the living room one evening when mum and rod were watching a film on video and i just cought sight of one bi, where two people had arrived too late somewhere and had to sleepp on a small bench ti wait for the morning. it's not much but it;s just so different. and in 'Amelie' when she sleeps in a phone box. ok it;s not just about sleeping in strange places there's just so much excitement out there for people who know how to get at it. people who have all sorts of jobs. generally the jobs that appeal to me are ones that don't really require much education. in fact i really fancy trying out being a maid. a real old fashioned one that has to do loads of things like polishing silver and things, though i hate saying that because i always feel that i'm being too posh and middle class wanting to try out stuff that the poorer classes do, but it's not. for one thing i'm not middle class, i don't see anyone as poorer class, or any class at all realy, and i don't like to think of there being people 'lower' than i am, exactly. this isn't working out very well. every word makes me sound more pompous, but in truth i hate any way of distinguishing between different types of people. we're all people after all. but what i'm saying is i like stuff that's more than just...cleverness. hmm i always wanted to be a waitress when i was little and there;s other things which i forget. i just get the feeling that you get to meet more interesting people that way, thoough i don't know why. and anyway, i'm sure that there's plenty of interesting people in teaching. it's just sometimes i get fed up of the idea of qualifications always being important and higher education and things. which is silly because really i love education, which sounds odd, but it means you're so free in many ways, at least at school, while t's compulsory because you can't earn a living really and you have less burdons of responsibility etc. if i had a chioce i'd love to stay around this age and at school for a good while longer, but of course it can't happen. and now i'm leaving compulsory education and will soon start to run up bills and all that rubbish which is so silly. Ho hum. oh dear i don't really know what i want. it's just my life is all prepared, A levels, UNi and then, if i'm still interested, PGCE. as long as i'm still alive of course. and for noce it would be interesting to not know. in some ways it would be fun in the short term to fail some GCSEs but i don';t want to really and i do want to go to uni. and do a levels and i don't want to fail at all. i do tend to talk about myself rather don't i. i suppose that that's the point but still it feels a little selfish. i do wish that i hadn't given up creative writing because i did enjoy it, but i just can't write anything now, anything good ir not fact like this, or whatever it is. and i'm not saying that this is good either. but i miss creative writing sometimes. i will miss it. it's just that the one story that other people liked was sort of original and though i can think of other ideas they never work and i'm so rarely in the mood to write anything that if i start something one night i'm liable not to ever finish it, or more probably, put it in the  recycled paper basket after wri[[ing it up, which usually makes me feel better. i hope all this makes no sense really. i think i go a bit odd after not seeing anyone a) that isn't my family and/or b) isn't remotely near my age. seeing Ben is very nice, but to stay slightly... well not sane but un-odd t helps to see people that are friends out of choice too, though i like ben loads not just because he's my brother, though i'm glad he is. agani this probably dosen't make sense. like he very odd jazz on the radio which i don't like at all. it's like some of the modern art work, it's gone past nice and is just silly, but people can get away with it because they're famous. like turning a bike upsidown and calling it are, or hitting a violin with a pencil (as this music sounds) and calling it Jazz. but that's late friday night on radio three for you i suppose. well goodnight. Preview: Robert thinks that Jane is going to run away with his ex-wife's sister's dog, while May is having misgivings about her new floral patterned dining room table cloth. Rachel is fretting over her daughter, Lucy who is spending alltogether too much time with that rascal of a boy, sir lemptington-grit from the big house who sometimes wears leather jeans, whilerobert'sv ex-wife's sister's dog is lusting after paul, an ex-soldier who was secretly a wonman for 25 years in the 34th war where she died nine years ago. tune in to next weeks episode to find out what happens...

      i find that i just always want to be part of something... like... well it's hard to explain.. well. if something's popular and going on for a bit, and no one really thinks about who's doing it... i like that. it's sort of like newspapers except all the journalists are sort of famous now (in london anyway), but i don't want that. i think it would be cool to be doing something and no one knows it's you but everyone's talking about it... if anyone's read 'the truth' (TP) you might know what i'm talking about a bit. it's just so much more interesting to be part of something rather than to be an outsider... i don't know wh exactly, but i suppose you don't always have to (though of course sometimes you have to do things that you don't have to). that's why i want to be a teacher i think,  because education and schools takes up such a large part of the running of the country... like holliday prices are modelled around it and all sorts of other things and i just don't want to be an outsider. that's not that i want to go with the flow, only i don't like being one of the many who just watch it happen and are affected by it a bit, i want to be one of the few who are in it and do the effecting, if that makes sense. i like to be different. (most people reading this should already know that, or i hope so anyway..) though of course i do want to pass on knowledge and help people too,  not just be different. it's just there's so many people living boring normal lives and i want to be part of  something    at least. if possible something big, but not be known for it... like write a really popular book and no one knows who i am (like that lemony snicket fellow, who i personally think is a bit of an idiot)or... well something else. when people talk to you about you, not knowing oit's you... like saying to you "that [editor/writor/something else] is so [something]" when the [editor/writor/something else] is you... if you get the idea. it would be sooooo cool. but i don't think it would happen/ though i like the idea of having lots of jobs. like there was this man counting fish in our river and before that he was something... then he lied and said he could do stonemasonary and got a job as a stone mason. i think that is soo cool, thouhg i don't think i'd ever do it. though i really should work to be like those people who i want to be like, but more on that another day perhaps. right, that's my ramble for the day at least. live life in luxury, that's what it's for. or mabe not...

      doing things that you wouldn't usually do is incredibly good for you. too much routine can make you ill and no doubt, causes cancer (though since just living seems to cause cancer these days perhaps the only cure is mass-suicide, though i'd rather not consider that) while changes are really good at making your brain work better - even brushing your teeth with teh other hand. i thinks that's why music fest was so good. i pretended to be a confident person for a week and almost pulled it off, though it flagged a little after the first... day. and now i'm playing the sax in a different way and all sorts of other things, thoug i  was planning to change before that started too, sort of. what i'm mostly talking about is the fact that i walked up constitution hill, or whatever it's called, in aberystwyth, today, which i ahve never done before, despite having lived there for all my life - sort of. it was a spur-of-the-moment descision too, as i thought i'd walk from the pier to then end of the prom, then once i got there i suddenly decided to go up (is this perhaps the influence of the simpsod and homer's 'stupid risk' docterine? i think we should be told.) and it wasn't fantastically exciting, but nor was the alternative, namely walking home and watching telly for the rest of the day. or whatever. sigh, and i am missing sax course rather badly, though for some reason i have the feeling that someone from there might read this, thuogh i don't know why really, but i don't want to say much more, just in case. though there's nothing nasty i'd want to say as it was a thuroughly enjoyable week (is that why i don't want to say anything  - it is a little embarassing that i enjoyed something like that so much and took part in next to none of the extra-social activities. i'm a simple country girl, i'm afraid and am falling behind or something, with social stuff. i sometimes feel i'd be happier living a few decades ago when we were not expected to want to go out and get drunk every night once we're past our 12th birthday or whatever. call me sad if you will, but i really do find pleasure in other things. no really do call me sad, because i am. and i admi it, but at the moment i'm enjoying life too much to do anything about it. and i don't think i can do anything about what i like anyway. oh dear. i think i'd better give up now before i embarass myself even more, or reveal any more awfully dull things about my life if you can understand any of my rantings to finish the previouslt begun story, i went up a hill because i could, then i came down.   and as an after-note, i tend to write these things after midnight at my dad's, so i haven't usually seen any of my friends for at least 48 hours and that can leave me not always unhappy in a depressed way, just a bit more odd mabe even this doesn't make sense i think i'll go to bed. bloody washing machines, eating my pound coins sleep tight eveyone, especially if you are reading this between the hours of 12am and 4pm and 7pm and 10:43pm have a good day

      hmmm... if you can possibly avoid it, try not to read most of the stuff that I have previously said... there's not much point in it. things should be on the change what with me going to get my hair cut, being in the sixth form and maybe hopefully but probably disappointingly not going to get a baritone sax to try out. I would say woohoo but as previously mentioned, I now expect that it won't turn up and anyway I'm not in the mood. despite all this change I feel all too much the same as always, which is totally boring and just don't have the egnergy to push my comfort zones any more, I'd rather hide inside them where it's safe and comfortable. I suppose this mood is rather a silly one, I've been t the osteopath today and so my bones are rather re arranged and this generally leaves you with a slightly dizzy and leading to overtired feel. Unless that's life. How stupidly meaningless/ I'm getting worried also that this blog in immensely stupid. Having looked round at others' blogs they seem to be mostly silly poetic girls wanting to talk about their feelings and, thinking that they are good writers, display their poetry. Was that why I wrote that crap about dragons? Probably. Also probably because I felt it would be different. It was stupid. yet again I  am digging myself into a silly hole here and it is mainly due to my lack of mental stability and general happiness that seems to come with the time of night that I update the blogs.  by the way, if anyone watches pop idol or pop idol extra (or lite or whatever that thing is called, probably on ITV2) - I don't by the way - but the man with slightly long floppy brown hair and a gorgeously gentle Scottish accent who plays the piano and comments occasionally is the musical director. He is Douglas Whyte or white and he was the piano player in the National Theatre's production of Brecht's 'threepenny opera' that started last October and ran for far too short a time, until about march. And he's bloody good too. Good to see him around and all that anyway...  bath

I might try to explain but there's no square root button on this keyboard that I can see, though I could try to fasion a crude one... v/¬ hmm mabe not...  ummm... something that could make charl rather jealous, we've just watched eddie Izzard dvd plus a bit of his french show (brill). flag chow i've forgotten the rest je suis le president de burundi.

I haven;t seen the end but it looks brilliant too. and there was this cirque de soleil thing on yesterday.... there are people who can put their feet either side of their head!!! on the ground next to it! I can't even touch my head with my toes. hmmm all these groovy things seem to have some sort of common - nationality-type -denominator... I wonder why. specially if I say amelie and yann tiersen., thuogh paul desmond wasn't french, and so were a lot of other people. there are lots of other good things and I haven't had time to get away to some things. like book reading. I was going to read three books this holiday, I'll be lucky if I finish one now. (the point was I was gong to take two days off to read a TP and something else which is very possible) but I haven't and won't not with these damned english essays to do. the questions have been especially vicious this time. I think it's the time of year - it does something to people's brains. eek it's half 11 dkjfskfhckvbhehjebfjhaldjfuflllllllllllllllub. squank (that's what marrows say)

      yes it is very sad of me to be online on christmas day I suppose, but then again no more than any other day really. it's not been a particularly special day anyway... but lots of very kind presents from people. amongst them... er... a lovvely decorated notebook from beth, a cool book and a cusion from poppy, a guinea-pig calendar from ben, executive hand squeesie things to strengthen the wrists from 'father christmas', shoes from mum, which I've had for several weeks already, and my absolute favourites, a brilliant private eye book from Kathy and all sorts of nice things from charl, and while I adore the photos and frames I think the best is the 'teach yourself latin book' I shall have to learn latin and beat charl to learning telekenisis or whatever the book I gave her was about. Hi! I'm Robin Hood! Twang. I come from sher-wood for-est. twang. and so on.  and of course, lots of loverly other things from other people. We're off to dad's tomorrow and that's far more exciting because he's going to get a DVD player an we've got eddie izzard's new 'sexie' video (standup by the way, not...anything else)...on dvd!! eek! plus more...um yes. and so far... £70 in cash cheques and book tokens. everyone is so nice, but i'd like them without the nice presents of course... and I can't escape christmas without plenty of guilt, but i'll leave that there for today. we began to watch some film about jack and the beanstalk which was three hours long so we gave up. then I spoke to my unkle, whom I never speak to though the'yre all really cool down there (mum's brother) or up there or wherever. he plays the guitar really well and is sort of in a band, he says, and I want to go and see them loads now. I've also been fiddling on the guitar because Ben was trying to begin to play, and mum taught me a bit to 'anji' by simon and garfunkel which I have never heard but it's sort of easy but sounds nice. I must find out some more S&G songs to play - a new thought. right this incredibly priviledged rant must end for now.  many millions of thanks to everyone for my lovely presents (particularly Kath and Charl who are the most likely to read this, though even that is unlikely) as my dad said to me this morning 'happy birthday' (my birthday is not today by the way... and he didn't even mean it as a joke. I do worry alot about both my parents) well well.

      deary deary me. no one's going to read this anyway so it doesn't matter. I just spent about half an  hour trying to find my username  and password. and now i've forgotten what I was going to say.  I've just  realised that charl (orangoutansberet@blogspot...) has been updating her blog and so thought i'd annoy her by copying her. ha it's december the 23rd and is wonderfully wet outside. I'm missing school friends already and have almost two more weeks of holidays left (oh the torture!) but too much work. It's christmas and they're expecting us to have the self controll to actually do work! deary me. anyway.... um... it's the christmas holidays and all is more or less well. Ben is home, which is lovely, mostly. and other things are happening, like he's going to get us a new computer and we might have it my tomorrow which is just craziness. it's going to have a flat screen and other things like that and will have to cost  lots of maths revision going on. it's fun to sound clever and know things that are actually utterly useless, like how to work out the area of a section of a circle (actually GCSE work) and how to do long division with polynomials (great fun!). humm. i could say lots but I won't because  have spent so long online as it is. at least now I know my username and password (at least I think i do...) yes. er... bye then.

      I keep having this idea to keep a diary, but about something only loosely connected with my real life, mainly because I don't really think that writing about my real life would be much fun but also because making up a whole new life wuold be. I really hope I get around to it one day, thruogh all the home work. I'm so busy with english literature at the moment I barely have time to read. I could start the last 'his dark materials' book tomorrow night. I just don't know if it's the right thing to do. I promised myself I'd read at least one book between the last one and the next one, but I haven't but if I don't start oit now when will I? oh isn't life hard!! (i'm not being serious by the way I am soooo lucky that these books exist and I can read them and everything. yet again i express my utter amazement at the wonderfull things in this world. how lucky we are (most of us)). yes even those who have hard descisions to make are lucky...  lucky to have the choice. I just got one of those chain-friendship letters from natalie, one line of which was "you are one person to the whole world but may be the whole world to one person" yes it's corny and cliched and I've heard it before but I still sort of like it. It's interesting how love, or the lack of it ocupies many people's minds for much of the time (well Ok perhaps the word 'love' should actually be replaced by a different but much associated word), when ...is it 1/3 of the population of the earth is starving? I'm not giving judgement though. just noticing. I got a new Yann tiersen CD this weekend, it's the soundtrack to 'goodbye lenin' which I haven't seen yet but want to. anyway, it has photos of him in. he looks very stressed and smokes, and is young (20s). it's cool to see photos though it doesn't really matter, but I've allways wondered what he was like (age wise mostly) since he is able to create such utterly totally and compltetly wonderful music... sigh eek. and since that one rain day off from school when I started listening to simon and garfunkel concert in central park i've become completely hooked. the CD of concert in central park was a really wobbly copy so i've ordered my own and thrown the copy on top of ben's wardrobe so i won't listen to it too much, but i've just discovered that the CDs (from amazon) won't come till the 9th of march! and then I won't get them till much later... two weeks from now minimum. oh dear how will I survive. I think the 60s must have been such an amasing time to be alive, everything seemed to be so new then.. like the media (well TV and radio) was sort of learning things and that's what takes the real effort and makes the amasing work. like things from the 60s, Monty python, the Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy amongst others (OK well the 60s onwards) as well as the music and stuff (heh heh) was all pushing the limits. now everything is too easy and we are still on the brink of nuclear war (always will be untill it happens i suppose) but nothing seems new. mabe this is just a bored young person's view of the world, but everything has been done in the ordinary media by now (not media as in news, but as in books, films, art etc.) and everything new is scietific. though i'm probably just naive and unimaginitive. well you've been a great audience, thankyou for listening and goodnight! just step out the back, jack get a new plan, stan don't need a decoy, roy just listen to me. just hop on the bus, gus don't need to discuss much just drop of the key, lee and get yourself free

      yay. life seems to be grand. pretty much. I have a cold and and over tired but that's ok. and, after winning the school eisteddfor english competition i seem to be able to write things again!! though it could also be the effect of 'Northen Lights' and 'the subtle knife'.  I don't know hoe deeply it's possible to fall in love with a book but...'swoon'. or two books really. and still the third one to read... all 500+ pages of it. heaven. What I can't get over is how there are so many wonderful things in the world. all those things that keep you alive and are just so great. here's my list (correct at moment of publishing): eddie izzard Yann tiersen Terry Pratchett books His Dark Materials Simon and Garfunkel lots of other brilliant things mixed together and of course all my friends etc. and school-sort of life sometimes. how lucky we all are that these things can exist. I just can't believe it sometimes, especially when people get so stupid and say that life isn't worth living (I don't really mean depressed people I mean stupid teenagers who think they're everything). but then I've probably not got into a depression deep enough that one of those marvelous things can't get me out. Davy's just offered to 'get with me' at charlotte's party (tomorrow at Danny's house, all 'nice people' invited but no psychopaths or serial killers, sorry) for a small fee, of course how sweet. sorry about that brief interlude where was I... I think i'd sort of finished actually. life is good and we should learn to apreciate it properly. and each other of course. I've always wanted to live life to the full but am too nervous and believe that I'm happy the way I am. How naive and ignorant I am. Goodnight and wish us a happy party tomorrow!  briought to you by brighton films courtesy of the bya rading co. and oxfam donkeys - 'phil' and 'buster' a ferdinand garinzia film

      I've realised why I can't do links: because I don't have the option.... I think that all you other people have the option on your blog layouts but mine doesn't. so i'm not just totally stupid. (though it'll probably turn out I'm wrong, but never mind that). cool anyway: two days of holidays left... bring on nice easy school life! :o)

      I suppose seeing as there is a whole ONE person online,and it being 11.15 pm, I should be asking where the party is. By the way, I haven't been murdered yet, but i'm saying out of the kitchen untill someone else goes in before me. I just realised that my last blog must have takem me about an hour to write. How I do love writing, in any form. I really should go to bed, and this should be a very short blog but I really want to go on. there are plenty of things to write about, particularly because I've been reading more of janie's nice little blog, but as I have plenty of work to do tomorrow and for every hour of this next week if I so wish, and as i'm mainly a little... under happy... because i'm tired, I'd better go to bed. roll on school, I say. not only will friends be around again, but it might actually be possible to get some rest. some people need the term 'holiday' explained to them. I always understood it as a time without work perhaps, or a rest, but I seem o be mistaken, it's just a chance to do work in a different environment or under different conditions. "a change is as good as a rest" humph. oh I wish I could go on. there's so much I could say... about oxbridge, about my step sister's twins, punctuation, maths, shcool, english, next door's baby - due today! and oh so much more.  nope, bed time damn well another time then and they ll lved happily ever after the end

      I have come to the conclusion that one of the few things that we can pass on to our children, and be pretty sure that they'll keep a hold of is our family traditions. I've been thinking about it for a while now, but am prompted to explain from reading the short piece in janie's blog (www.thedoldrums.blogspot.com) about easter. **quick pre-main feature interlude - yes I am aware of the availability of links etc and the fact that everyone now has them, but I don't care and can't be bothered to do anything about it, so there - and everyone has titles for each blog too now - what's with that?** Anyway, everyone has family traditions, most are obvious at these times of the year when everyone does roughly the same thing but not quite. christmas is the prime example, of course. there is the size and shape of the stockinh/pillow case/five gallon sack. whether you get presents officially from father christmas (usually for the children though not necessarily of course) and whether you leave hims sherry or cocoa or nothing, and if you leave something for the reindeer. do you have your 'stockings' in your bedroom or by the fireplace? when do you open your presents... after dinner, first thing in the morning, christmas eve? there are limitless posibilities for your own customised christmas, ad because you always do the same thing every year (well... my intended audience is about my age (17) and generally will not have left home yet, or is still going home for chrismas), and never know what others do, you rarely consider that there is an alternative. My brother was talkking about his girlfriend (now ex-) last christmas, and she (23, never left home) said to him "don't you enjoy the selection boxes at christmas?" he was confused, but it turns out that for her it is practically tradition to get one of those cardboard boxes of chocolate bars for christmas, and assumed that everyone else dos too. she will, most likely go on to give her children them every christmas, and so on. of course children get the mixture of parents' traditions and some made up along the way, but there are probably some families whose ways of doing things go back centuries, though it was not planned and is not even realised. I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't making a lot of sense, but at least I know what I'm talking about, and I'm getting fed up of simplifying things so people can understand. Eeek, I just heard something in the kitchen and everyone's in bed. if I'm found murdered tomorrow, you know how they got in. I'm dreadfully missing all my wonderful and helpful simple things that I need to cheer me up. I decided I was getting a little 'over familiar' with my simon and garfunkel CDs so I decided to give them up for the easter holidays, and it's killing me. I have to persevere or else I will feel a failiure, and wiould not enjoy the music much even if i did listen, but I am missing it all readfully, and have over a week to go... plus my beloved Yann tiersen has stayed in cynghordy... what I wouldn't do for just one CD. I was desparately looking forward to dad borrowing 'Amelie' DVD tonight so I could watch the commentary on it, as well as be cheered up by the general splendour and beauty of it, but alas it was not in stock, so he had to get 'some like it hot' instead good film, but not exactly wonderfull or conforting. I'll have to make him get it from the library so's I can have it for the rest of the week. but not tomorrow! damn these bank holidays! even 'goodbye lenin' has gone, which supplied me with the little comfort of its goergeous soundtrack (my dear stressed Yann again) though only in moderations. and finally to mr. Izzard. his faboulous work has been so over- watched my me that itprovides but shallow comfort, and if I over watch it more it will lost its remaining magic, so like simon and garfunke, the magic will have to be recharged by a period of seperation. sigh. though I did watch 'dressed to circle' - the french  one which was great nad made me fel good by my watching it all without subtitles and not understanding very little. and of course also to my dear friends, who are no use to me 50 miles away in cynghordy, when they never come online! deary me. what poor and dreadfully middle class woes I have. well I suppose everyone should be able to moan sometimes, and at least only three and a half people will read it here. thaks for listening, you've been a wondeful audience  yours faithfully mr and mrs hughes from south cornwall.

      oh deary me. I am left with a kind of sickening drop in confidence once again. I just got an email from a very kind girl called amber, who has just gotten into cambridge university, and my dad knows her mum so it's been arranges that we can email/talk and she can give me info and tips on oxbridge applications. she is officially gifted, but still it gives me little comfort when she talks xtensively of knowing worsworth poems, saying how the poem of a non poet can be identified because "rhythm of this fake one was not rolling sound in earth's diurnal core". what does diurnal mean? and many other things, while I am accused of being good at english because I have the ability to describe a hilltop, and to begin essays with the word 'while...' . i could put it down to the fact that i had a teacher in primary school who barely spoke english, and an english teacher in secondary for 2and1/2 years who barely spoke at all because he was sleeping. but it isn't that, and it isn't that we had to read welsh books every fortnight for the first three years of secondary school either. If I cared enough I would know all these things, and not have spent half my life reading terry pratchett, but would actually enjoy jane austen, virginia wolf and those bronte women, despite the lack of interesting writing and soppy plots (though even there i'm a little hazy, i got bored of virginia wolf and two brontes in a few pages... *sigh* how uneducated and oafish i am. i'm going to post this before I lose interest I want to go to bed zzzzzzzz

      by the way... those little extra green arrows on the links menu that look like they're there by mistake and I don't know how to get rid of them are actually really extra special magic links that can only be accessed by really special people. are you special enough?

      I don't know where those little green arrows came from on the side bar, I'm sure they were black dots earlier.. and I don't have titles on this one. I'm sure I could if I messed around with the template enough but I can't be bothered, and though I'm picking it up I still have a lot to learn. oh what joy work is. I will have to be a teacher, I don't think i'll survive 9 to five days, at least not in an office. dull dull dull. and I haven't had a chance to rest after exams, while most other people did, but us poor maths sufferers had to sit an awful paper then go straight to work exp. after spending the weekend revising (or should have been). how full of woes (N.B. this is sarcastic) well... I ended up doing today what I did on tuesday, publicising an event by walking round town, but at least I got rid of all my posters this time. I have been a good girl this week, I have been more or less sociable and asked questions instead of stitting there feeling stupid. I have done exercse by walking up a near vertical hill every morning and afternoon, I have done things I wouldn't usually have done and didn't really want to do, but since it was the politest option (eating curry basically). talk about pushing your comfort zones! I should really have gone to this weird performance tonight... perhaps I should explain. I was working for the centre for performance research. they mostly sell books and do research but they have on at the moment a summer school with different workshops each week. this week there was something weird which I explained before (with all the people) and tonight they were going to perform a little of the weird stuff they had done, but I didn;t really feel like watching beacues I'd seen what they did and it was all a bit random to me. but perhaps I've earned it? though I have little relaxing to do this weekend, but the idea of having nothing to do should be a welcome break... then back to school! talking about comfort zones, I have quarter of a mind to do the sax course again this year, but I don't really want to. I'd like to do something, and that could be fun, but I know that it wasn't half as good last year as I thought and I don't really want to get stuck with a group of near-proffessionals again. I really just want something I can do, and learn from, but it would be great, for a change, to be reasonably and confidently sure of what i'm doing... I just want to have DONE something and not...sat at home all the time, but there's no one to do anything with at any rate and I get tired of doing things on my own. if it were possible I'd do MYPT summer school but it won't be possible. oh well.

      well, I succumbed to the inevitable. but I stil don't seem to get the links working, though a little effort may do the job. I shouldn't be on the computer, i've been on it most of the morining, watching little videos of CPR (centre for performance research)'s summer school and taking stills. then we did some filming of this year's summer school which was cool but the direcor-y people were rather too full of themselves and thought they and their group were better than everyone ever, which was not really true since most of the stuff they did was a bit too random, though defenately interesting. to begin with all 11 (I think) of the actor-y people walked round the museum,  mostly scareing people, though that wasn't the intension. the costumes were cool, there was: a woman with all blood round her mouth and brown stains down her top a woman with male-tpe trousers and braces and a cool hat (michael-jackson y though i'm not sure why) A woman waring a raincoat and wellies (and nothing else) A woman in sort of teenager type clothing a man with a woman's one strap top on a man with a weird fake moustache (drooping) a woman with just a nightie a woman all in black with a balaklava a man with nothing very notable on, except his shirt did have cowboys on.. a man with a written on t shirt saying things about america a woman in a red dress with red writing all over her a woman with a black dress carrying white wings that's twelve and it feels like there were more... anyway it was interesting. and i've been using an apple computer anyway which was cool but comfusing. damned microsoft and its ways of making you used to it. and listening to jo wiley trying to be cool about glastonbury, though one gets the feeling she's not even got a whiff of the real meaning of it for most people and will be making slightly nervous jokes about smoke and people behaving strangely for the rest of the week. thank god it's not essential to listen. and i impressed people with my knowledge of the red hot chilli peppers, in that they're in cardiff...damn it, is it tonight. I hope so. well it doesn't really make any difference. enjoy the nice pretty colours childen

      ohhhh should I? there are options for numerous blog templates, all of which have the mod cons, like links sections etc. should I ditch my slightly more unique though not hi-tech or smothed looking blog template for something more interesting. should I rather bear these ills...? life is full of choices, and this one needs long and painful discussion. work exp. going ok. three more days, everyone friendly, nice, though frankly I can't wait till it's over and I can have a rest, even if we are filming in the castle tomorrow.  www.highfantastical.blogspot.com  if anyone could reply to this I would ask for guidance on my dilemma. suggestions?

      the disjointed and minaly uncomprehensible rmablings of a preoccupied and guilty mind  has blogger changed or is it because i'm on a different computer? hmm  gosh, aren't things odd. no, I mean it things i suppose means people and relationships at the moment... well it doesn't really but I feel like writing about them and needed an introduction. relationships are sooooooooo strange. i've been looking at photos of my parents' wedding.. (a bit odd because they divorced when I was three). it's the thirtyeth aniversary this year (from 1974) though will not be recognised in any way. i don't know what time or year though. but thirty years... it's a long time and they've only been divorced for about 14/15 years... which means they were married for  at least  ten which is a considerable time really... i always thought that the relationship must have been a 'flop' or something, but it kept going for a decade at least so something must have been right. it's nice to think of them happily married, I wish I could remember something about it. since I don't really remember anything much untill a few years after the divorce i'm always worried that there's something important that I don't know... though i don't know what. if there is something i'd rather not know, it's nice to have a happy picture. on a slightly related topic... I have to keep reminding myself that life has no rules. (have i 'done' this bit before?) people think that things aren't fair... but compared to what? because you like someone loads doesn't mean they  have  to like you back, .either there's no destiny in love/marriage, or whoever is in control of it works damn hard, since so many people meet an both like each other. but then how muh unrequited love is there around that we don't know about? I always thought that if anyone asked me out i'd be so touched that they actually liked me i'd have to say yes. i'm sort of pleased to have been proved wrong. yet I still can't understand when you see women turning down men who obviously love them with a passion (films mostly so i suppose the belief faculties can be running a little thin). my trouble is I want independnce but still someone who has power over me (think that glamarous wedding-type carry...sigh). well i'd beter stop before this gets so cryptic that it's in some other language or something. this does make snese, if you have my mind, though i beg that you don't come and get it right now.. see you all later

      I think I wrote once before that we all think 'if only they knew what it's like for me, then they'd understand', so we all&nbsp;spend most of our time trying to make other people understand us rather than trying to understand them. I may be trying to be overly, er... self important or condmening of others, but I know I'm guilty of it too. that's mostly what the majority of these blogs are about, people want their say, and because normally other people won't listen, this is the chance to be heared, or at least to say what you want, which is really the important thing. and that could be a good thing. bottled up things can be so much worse, like fizzy elderflower bottles that explode if you leave them too long and then you've got a great sticky mess and are picking pieces of plastic bottle off the ceiling for the next year. (what and apt and totally unoriginal and uninspiring simile) ritechous was the word I wanted earlier, though not spelt like that. what a difference someone noticing you can make. if someone just sort of... says something nice or just kind it can make the world of difference, and it's usually something so simple, but we rarely do it. I think to myself from time to time that I should remember to do things that one wouldn't usually do, but I chicken out and think that it's an invasion of the other person't privacy, or that they probably wouldn't want me talking to them or something. it's lazyness really I suppose, can't be bothered to face the consequences of getting it wrong. (I do hope laziness really does have a z in it. I seem to be losing my grasp of the language. oh dear..) Oh how just smiling can help so much. it really does,&nbsp; even if you feel 'down' don't feel like smiling, it can really  really  help, I promise. of course   it helps if you have something  really good  to smile about. [I had a bit in here about how everyone should be able to find something to smile about but took it out because it sonded too much like I was just trying to say 'oh pull yourself together' to the world]&nbsp; BUT we should try to help give other people something to smile about, however hippyish or whatever that sounds, it's what I believe, though whether I'll put it into practice on an industrial scale is very highly unlikely, because I an a selfish, lazy, and stupidly dull bitch. anyway, see you all keep practicing that happiness and now please smile. properly. for... ten seconds. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 it won't hurt you, so there's no reason not to. and remember, you're gorgeous (everyone is, but  you  especially)  heh heh  ps. still missing you, charl (for&nbsp;if you're still&nbsp;reading these)&nbsp;xx

      hello! I'm happy. It's an odd thing really, especially since people are so rarely actually happy, I think. you forget about it. I think happiness need lots of practice to get it well done and then it can become infectious if you do it right. there is a particular reason for my happiness at this moment, but it is very VERY strange, so will not be disclosed. :o) ho hum, not much else to say. I suspect that not seeing anyone real for a while may be affecting my sanity a little, but not in the dark easter way, and if you're happy then what does it matter if you're a bit ...less sane? heh heh (or should I say mwahhahahahaha!!!!!!! etc.) and I'm going to work for money tomorrow! ...well sort of.&nbsp; it's for jon-at-the-printers', just sticking stickers on envelopes, and he said that it may give me a taste of working in the third world, and he has threatened to pay me in rice so.. maybe not REAL work but who cares. I will update my other blog when I have something more specific to say as opposed to general rambles. heh heh panhaggety=dyslexic fish that is everywhere (the word pan has been flittering around a lot recently, it means 'everywhere or everything'as in pan galactic gargle blaster.) the world is still full of wonderfull things, many of which help in its continued revolution, I believe anyway. so... keep practicing that happiness and try to get it perfected. it can't hurt can it?
