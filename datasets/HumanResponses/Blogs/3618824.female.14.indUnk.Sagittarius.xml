      as you can probably tell im in a bad mood. Yeah BAD mood. I'm just angry at the whole world. Im just aggrivated with myself. And everyone else. So yeah.. just for reference.  Not much else to write.. i mean yeah.. im not even sure why im mad. I have so many mixed emotions.. Im not good at describing how i feel. I'm at the point i don't care who gets mad anymore. Freak everyone else.. Forget what you think about me. You can think im a slut, bitch, or whatever.. i don't care. Not anymore. I give up on trying to make everyone happy. Im me! I will be who ever the heck i wanna be. If i don't fit your so called "Image" then oh well. I'm not trying to fit in anymore, or tying to impress. I quit. I give up on everything. Yeah everything. I give up on.. talking to people, trying to be nice, pleasing everyone, being perfect. Im not perfect, no one is and you sure aren't. So why should i even try to be when im not perfecT!??!?!?! NO ONE IS PERFECT SO DON'T TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE SOMEONE THEY AREN'T!!!   Thats it.. thats alli have to say..:-/ Thats it.. ceeya

      Well.. I haven't been writing in my blog much! haha Shame on me.. haha.. I've been doing alot of thinking. And im scared.. Me the girl that is never scared!Im not the type that is scared.. But im scared of what may come of my actions and how i handle certian situations.   As most people know.. Im not the type to voice my feelings or my thoughts on things. Im the peace keeper, and the type that does things for people only because it makes them happy, and not because it makes me happy. I do things because thats what people want. I can't say no to anyone. Everyone thinks im this happy person thats perfect and i have no problems. I have problems just like any other human on the earth. And im not perfect. I smile to hide everything. When i smile i guess i think people can't see whats really going on. There aren't many people i tell things to. If im mad i usually will keep it to myself. And i've never been the type to voice my thoughts and feelings. I am hoping to change myself. I don't want to be me anymore. I want to be Hannah the girl that stands up for what she believes in. And Most people will tell you that you shouldn't change who you are. If i don't change who i am i will continue to be walked on and never be able to tell people how i really feel. There are so many things people don't know about me. No one has ever asked. So.. I just haven't told.  But whatever.. I know you don't want to hear this crap. Oh she just wants people to feel sorry for her. Its not like that.. believe what you want..  Thanks to those who listen and care how i feel.. That means alot to me. And thanks for being there.. love you all  Ceeya

      Well.. this whole weekend i haven't been able to write. So now im writing the things i want to say. I thought this whole weekend that there was so many things i could write about and the first one was Jeremy, and then the second one was myself, and the third one was how i feel.. well.. Im not sure which one i'll write about. jeremy is a great topic. But i've already written about him and im sure he doens't want me writing about him. And im sure you don't want to hear it. But hey im going to write about him anyways.. here it goes  One word.. Amazing, thats how i felt when i started going out with Jeremy, it was something that was so unexpected. I liked him for a while, but i didn't have the guts to tell him. Because my love life had always sucked and was just horrible. So how did a girl like me and a wonderful guy thats so wonderful and cares. I have no idea but im so glad i was chosen to be the lucky one for a change. So we started going out. And you know how it goes.. the guy sweeps you off your feet?? haha.. it was so  not  like that. yeah, he said amazing things and was great, but  at first i wasn't sure what i had gotten myself into. I had gotten myself into the most amazing thing and i think it has changed me. He knows all the right things to say and makes me feel great about myself. Example.. Me-do i look fat? Jeremy- ugh, would you not say that you are so not fat.. See! told you. He makes me feel like the only person on earth. Some of the people i have gone with in the past have been real buttholes.. and so conceded!!! He is not like them. He cares about how i feel about things, and wants to hear my opinion. He would never pressure me to do anything. And thats why i love him. Along with a million other reasons.  Jeremy, if you reading this, there are alot of things i haven't told you.. like, your the best thing thats happened to me. Im totally in love with you no matter what anyone says.. Your my everything, my counselor, my friend, my whole everything.. Your so amazing to me. And your the greatest guy i've ever known. I love you to death and i would do anything for you.. And thank you for everything, for being there for me, and listening when no one else was there. thank you for loving me..  i don't think i can type much more.. :( ceeya

      Sorry, i haven't been keeping up with this! haha.. Well.. Thursday i didn't really do anything, except go to VBS with Jeremy, and then to Wal-mart with him. And then i went home.. of course. Im not sure if i wrote about Wednsday or not.. if not.. all i did, was go get a physical done, and then went to the library and then went to VBS with jeremy. thats about it! and today, i shucked corn around 9 and then went home and took a shower and went back to bed.. until around 12 then i got up and talked to jeremy on the phone a little and then ate. Thats about it. Sorry my lifes not interesting but HEY! what can i say? Im just so boring! FEW THOUGHTS:   im beginning to realize im weaker than what i thought. I don't have any courage. But its okay, its not anyones fault but mine. I could stand up for myself in a lot of situations. But i don't i go along with everything. And it scares me sometimes. But im okay, and its not something thats life-threatening or it might be. who knows! ARGH! i don't know i don't know.   Theres not much else to write about. Any ideas please tell me because i can't think! haha.. i can but im afraid i'll hurt myself. Well.. thats it! CeeYa!

      Well.. the post this morning was short, because i had to go to the dentist. I hate the dentist. Now i am sitting here about to watch it rain. Or no.. im waiting on Jeremy to come get me and then going with him to VBS. Then.. probably comming back to my house and chillen out!:)  Im really sleepy.. not sure if i can stay awake! haha..  Its amazing how when you start to think the first thing that comes to your mind. What comes to your mind when you first think is what you think about the most. So as i sit here and think, the first thing that comes to mind is.. Well.. im not sure if i should say it. haha... no no no! its not that.. Actually Jeremy is the first thing that comes to mind. he's a big part of my life. among friends, and other things. He's an incredible person and im not sure what i would do without him.  Its almost like something you read out of a book. Girl meets boy, fall in love that instant. And live happily ever after? hahahaha! I always laugh when i hear the words happily ever after. Most of the fairytales tell a lie. well not most.. ALL of them do. You can't have a perfect life, with no fights or anything like that. So there is no logic to saying Happily ever after. there will always be something that goes wrong. Weather you try to fight the inevitable or not. You can't change things. Some things are just meant to be. Words of advice: don't go looking for everything to be perfect, because when you finally think you've found that everything is perfect, something will go wrong. trust me on that.  Well.. its time for me to go. Not much more to write. Hope you enjoyed reading this! haha.. I think im more caught up on the fact that people are reading it, and not saying actually how i feel. But maybe i can fix that. If i can't then oh well!:)  CeeYa!  fish are friend not food!! -Finding Nemo

      I feel like crap! im sleepy! but oh well.. Woke up and guess who i was thinking about? Jeremy! yOu got it right! He's my only one. Anyways, i don't think you want to hear about my perfect boyfriend. But haha.. thats a good topic!  Well.. i have to finish getting ready, then i will head to the dentist office. And then to get something to eat. And then probably back home!:) CeeYA!

      Well.. today wasn't a busy day. ALl i did was go to church and then eat. Then took a nap. Then thats about all. I figured in this blog i would write a little bit about myself and my outlook on life. This might be boring so if you want to stop reading right now feel free to. No one made you come here and read this, and no one is forcing you to listen to what i have to say. Since you, like many others don't listen to my opion on things then i suppose you will want to leave and not even read about my stupid life or my outlooks. Now for those who are keeping up and reading, here is everything, no blanks and no fill-ins this is my life and my outlooks.  General Info: I'm 14 currently, i shall be 15 in december(December 14 that is) for all of you who want to buy me a present! I live in fitzgerald and my name is Hannah. Thats so great isn't it?  School and extra cirricular activities: I will be attending FHS as a freshman.*Jumping up and down* What fun! I enjoy playing softball, and any other sport.  Faith: I am a Christian. Most people don't knows this. Only those who I attend Church with. I would say i am strong in my faith. I could be stronger but my faith is the only thing i am really confident in.  Love Life: haha.. this is the best part. And im sure all of you will enjoy reading this. Jeremy is my love life. He makes it complete. And everyone(i think) knows this. For 3 months he's put up with my selfishness and my mood swings, and a whole lot more that most guys wouldn't put up with. He's been there for me and hes never pressured me or anything of that sort.When im around him i feel i can be myself. With all my insecurities and everything else he's always made me feel wonderful about myself. He's the perfect example of a perfect boyfriend. And i love him with all my heart and more. I can't stress that enough. I don't talk about it that much.(My love life) Its not always been that great. But since me and Jeremy have been going out its wonderful. And i wouldn't trade my relationship with him for anything in the world. Yeah, we've had our good times.. and not that many bad. And i can't repay him for what he's given me. Hes amazing, and i love him.  And if your reading this Jeremy, I love YOu! haha..  My Friends: Annabeth  My Personality: im not the type to start fights. And if you ask any of my friends they would call me the "Peacemaker". I can't tell anyone no. Thats just me. And thats something im dealing with. People walk on me. But they don't know it because I don't have the courage to say anything to them. Im not the type to yell at someone or punch someone. Usually i'll be the first to say im sorry if someone else is mad at me. I cannot stand for someone to be mad at me. I'll always apologize for anything. Im weak when it comes to standing up for what i think is right. I always go with the flow. Never been a leader. Just a follower. No one really knows what i think because i've never really told them my thoughts about things. Despite everything thats wrong with my personality.. im strong in some ways. Im my own person and no one is like me. haha. Im abnormal at times. But most of the time im a happy person. (hahahaha) Funny huh? Enough on me.   I just thought i would put this in here because most people don't know the things that i just typed. Most people know me and Hannah the frail person. Theres more to me than what meets the eye. Im sure if you've read this you know this now. This is what i feel and if your offended by this im sorry, but i cannot help that your offended. That sounds like your problem not mine. Im not apologizing for saying anything in the entry. This is what i feel and its how i feel and i cannot change how i feel about things. Thanks for understanding and if you don't care what i think, don't read this. No one is making you. So Get over it.  Now that thats over with.. I'm going to bed now. I'll post another entry thingie tomorrow morning!! YAY!   "More than you think, and less than you know"-me

      I woke up.. And im in a pretty good mood!:) Im about to leave for church, and then we have homecomming so i won't be back to the house until around 2 or 3 or somewhere in there. I have permission from Jeremy to write whatever i feel. Sorry Jeremy, had to say that. Love YoU! So YAY! haha, but the biggest problem is im not sure how i feel. Its weird. But oh well. LaLaLaLaLaLa.. Im sleepY! AHHH!    Love? Hmm.. I was just thinking about looking up the definition of love. I'd describe it as being when you can't be around a person enough, and you can't stop thinking about them no matter how hard you try. Im not sure ole' mr. Webster really knows either. He was too busy writing a dictionary to know!:) hehe.. Well Not much more to say. But how do you know if your in love? Is it the feeling when your around this person and your heart does little flips? haha. Or is it when you can't breathe when you talk to this person? WHo KnowZ! Well.. I think thats a good note to leave on.     Later! PeaZe!!:) hehe  I trip myself out sometimes!

      Okay, well.. i've found out im not perfect. I really wish everyone would get off my back about everything. It gets old sitting here watching people step on you and not even take a second glance. I put up with alot of crap.. Its getting old. And im not sure that i can take anymore. Im scared.. scared of everything that may come.   What do i do?? How do i fix things?? Where did i mess up? It seems as if im always messing up.. and nothing i do is ever good enough for anyone. Its always "Hannah! YOU CAN DO BETTER!" or "Hannah YOUR NOT TRYING".. Im trying. I am all that i can be. And all i can be is me. Everythings going downhill. Im falling and theres no one to catch me or nothing to save me from falling. Im so confused. And sometimes i wonder if im the only one. Whatever.. I can't, never mind

      Today, i woke up around 9ish.. i guess.. Which isn't vital for your info. But hey im sure you really wanted to know that! Then i shucked corn. Great ain't it? i thought so. Then i went with Jeremy to wal-mart.. :) SmiLeZ! Then i came back here.. and im planning on taking a shower, and then going to bed later on.     Not in the greatest mood. Kinda feeling a little weird. **Depression mood**.. Which is normal for me. So many things going on. cannot please anyone with anything. Nothing is ever good enough for anyone. Maybe i should give up, and forget about what people say or think. Thats always a good solution. But it never works.      Whew.. anyways.. Glad thats over. Maybe this will be helpful. Alright.. Hope you had a great time reading this.. See YA! PeaZe!    Quote of the Day!::i love you not only because of who you are, but also because of who I am when I'm with you.

      Im in a mixed up mood. Im happy but then im sad.. But im happy  Guyz are stupid, and im not sure if i should put everything so im not going to..   Annabeth--Im sorry for everything, i can't make you see that it doesn't matter, and you shouldn't worry about it. Im here for you, no matter what. Love yOu oodles!!  Anyways,  I've been doing alot of thinking.. I have something to say  --Im so lucky, for so many things I don't always show my feelings for him and im sorry that i keep doing what im doing. I thank him for being there for me and for caring about me. Some guys just don't care and are only out for one thing. And every girl knows that if you find that guy that doesn't want just that then you have something special. And i plan to hold onto it. I love him, and its amazing im so happy...   Anyways.. enough of that cheesy Shiz!!:)  Im about to go to sleep.. gotta get up in the mornin for practie thingie.. love you Guyz!! and ceeya!

      Well.. This past week i have been gone to my dads. I went to the beach and to the braves game and a whole lot of other places while&nbsp; i was there. I came back later last night talked to Jeremy for a while. Then got up this morning and attended Softball conditioning!:) It RocKeD! Anyways.. So now im sitting here writing this and chillen out. &nbsp; While i was gone i heard that some people talked about me.. Hmm?? Well.. I've only got one thing to say, Stay out of my bees-wax. And don't talk about me behind my back. Thats so sad that thats all you have to do is to go around putting other people down. Kiss my butt because i don't care anymore. Think what you want and run your mouth all you want but in the end your just going to be another person that no one wants to be around because they know you'll talk about them. I could care less if you don't like me, i usually let it bother me but forget it. I Don't need and i sure as heck do not have to take your crap. So get over it and find something else to do with your time. Its your life you do what you want to with it and if you want to hurt other people go ahead.. its your life right?? &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyways enough with the DRAMA!!:-P oh oh oh oh oh! So.. I figure that i'll head out i think im about to go eat lasanga or whatever and take care of these 19 emails i have!:) CeeYa(Wouldn't wanna be ya!)

      Well its been forever since writing in this thing. Nothing much has happened. Everything is always the same! Well.. This whole week i'll be gone to my dads and i shall be returning Sunday night sometime. So don't expect a post. cause i know you guys love reading them! *cough* Not!!    Maybe its all in my head. Im not sure. But its weird. I don't know how i feel. I want to change so many things about myself. I don't want to always be the one whom never stands up for what she believes in. Or who is always put down and walked on. I don't want that. And im trying to change that. Maybe in good time things will be diffrent..? well.. Anyways.. im about to go.. I guess i'll write sunday or whenever.   Ceeya

      Sorry i haven't wrote.. Oh well.. anyways, im not in the best of moods. Maybe writing about it will help it.   Im tired of everyone being on my case about crap. Its always my fault that something has happened or im not good enough. I feel like im unwanted. Like who cares i mean really, And im at my breaking point where i don't think i can take any more of this shiz.. Its too much to handle and i've been trying so hard not to let things show and im trying to cope with everything and i've been doing this for forever and i can't take much more anymore. I feel like screaming.. just yelling and maybe that will get the point across that im tired of being accused and told what to do and how im suppose to live my life. Everyone has these expectations of me and i have to impress everyone. Its like im living in this big fat friggen lie. Because thats not who i want to be. I want to be me. Its everywhere i go i think im subjected to act a certian way and if i don't then everyone looks down on me. Whatever, i quit.. im calling it quits .. i can't take it anymore. i quit

       Hey Yaw! .. Well im at my grandparents enjoying a little family time. Eating supper here with my Aunt, Grandparents, and Dad and stepmom. Family is a big deal to me. I enjoy being with my family and i think that is the most important thing in life is being with family. Not everyone is as fortunate as me to have a family who loves and cares about them as much as i do.. And i respect that alot. :) That is so special to me because no matter what happens or if i fail or gain or whatever, They will always support me and be there for me no matter what. With my family my opinion counts and everything i have to say is important. And i love them for that!:)       thats my view on family.. and i hope everyone of you out there realizes how lucky you are to have a family that cares.         I thought i would address a little note..    Hope: Well.. i define hope as wishing for something and never loosing faith that it will not happen...     If you give up all hope then it will never happen. But if you keep believing and you set your heart to it then you can achieve anything you wish to achive.. So never give up hope because that means your giving it all up..      Well thats all i have..CeeYa!:)

         Well.. I survived yet another school day.     I dont know what my problem is..   I dont know.. Im so weird, and i have these odd feelings and im not really sure how i feel sometimes. Sometimes i think everything is okay and im happy and then one little thing happens or i start thinking diffrently and everything just comes crashing down and i start worrying and Im not happy anymore.           and.. its just weird, and i dont know what to do .. Its like if something happens then i tell myself that its over, or that i dont like him. If i think he doesnt like me anymore then i start thinking i dont like him anymore either. Its a chain reaction because im terrified that im going to be hurt by him. And part of me is saying no im not going to.. and part of me wants to believe him when he tells me hes not going to hurt me, but i cant make myself believe it. I want to believe him so bad.. But its scary knowing that im giving him everything and in the future i might be left with nothing. Or i might give him everything and then not get anything in return. I know that when you go into love that you have to be ready to get hurt.. Well its not suppose to be like that im not suppose to be just waiting around waiting to get hurt. I want to be able to not worry about it. Thats what im going to do.. If i get hurt then its life.. and life will go on..           So here i go.. Giving everything i have away.. and hoping and praying that i get it back someday.. knowing that i couldnt scares me, but also knowing that i might is great...          And i know some people that read this that know exactly where im comming from when i put this out.. And its scary..          Anyways..          My School day was okay, it could have been better!!:)          Thanks to all u guys who read this.. i dont see why anyone would want to.. But thanks!;) All those who read.. I love You!! and those who dont.. love you anyways!!                :P Okay, CeeYa!!
