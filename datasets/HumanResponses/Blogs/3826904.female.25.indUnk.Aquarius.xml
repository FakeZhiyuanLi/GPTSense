Lina was gonna go home today so she and spikey were in a world of their own..Mel and Siti were finishing up Pip's present as HE was also leaving today..So can u imagine the emotions going thru the room and if that wasn't enough..Mel was the DJ for the nite and trust me never put a someone with those kind of feelings incharge of putting on music!! Arrrgghh!!! JIWANG Y'ALL!!! it was more than i could take!! I closed my notebook...took my ciggies and bid them adieu...for i knew i wouldn't be able to wake up in the morning to send them off...6 bleeding AM!!! NO WAY!! Do i look like a fool to you?
