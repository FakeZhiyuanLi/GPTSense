       i'm fucking tired for the second day in a row.  went to school to take the english weekly test, then played soccer in the sports fiesta.  we did quite badly, losing in the quarter finals 1-0.  it was raining quite heavily and it was so cold that my lips were purple and my palms were blue.  in all we scored 1 goal and conceded 1 goal in the entire tournament.  and i conceded the goal.  damn.  i was caught wrong-footed and my view was blocked.  and what's worse was the goal was a pussyfied little weak shot from a little pussified person.  damn. then accompanied a fat fuck to buy shoes.  went to peninsula plaza, then went to peninsula shopping centre, then went to eat.  after that, went back to peninsula plaza again.  since all the shoes there didn't seem to attract his attention, we took a bus to pacific plaza.  the shoes there sucked too, so we walked to hereen.  then went to hmv to search for afi/bright eyes/modest mouse cd.  but the prices were astronomical, and didn't buy anything.  and he finally bought his shoes at flash and splash.  in all, i spent more than 3 hours walking around with a heavy bag.  so now my back, knees and shoulders hurt.  yay. once again, i'm too tired and can't be fucked to write more.

       got back from the cross country/mass run at about 7.30.&nbsp; fucking tired now.&nbsp; and i actually ran.&nbsp; stupid me was running faster because i thought my friends were in front... but they were behind...&nbsp; then drank 5 cups of (free) milo.&nbsp; and got a stomache ache for my greediness.&nbsp; i cringe at the thought of going back to school tomorrow.&nbsp; and i injured my ankle.&nbsp; have no idea what caused it.&nbsp; i think its because i sat cross-legged on the floor and my tigh was pressing into my ankle.&nbsp; but how the fuck would that cause an injury...    im tired, can't be fucked to write more.

       cheers.&nbsp; i just wasted 6 hours of my life yesterday.&nbsp; cheering at the national stadium.&nbsp; actually i didn't cheer.&nbsp; i just clapped along with the claps or something.&nbsp; anyway, i'm still wondering how the fuck do girls manage to make high high high&nbsp;pitch screams again and again and again without getting a sore throat?&nbsp; the screams were scary.&nbsp; made me feel like stuffing my fists into my ears.&nbsp; or into their mouths.    and it rained, quite heavily.&nbsp; then the cheerleading fuckers didn't allow us to go take shelter.&nbsp; so there we stood, like a bunch of fucktards, in the middle of the rain, while some other schools went to take cover.&nbsp; and the cheerleading fuckers decided to cheer.&nbsp; i wonder what is the fucking point of cheering if there isin't anyone running.&nbsp; thus, we fucktards stood in the rain, cheering for some invisible runners.&nbsp; of course, i didn't cheer.    for all our hard work, sji finished 2nd in b division and 6th in c division.&nbsp; then i had to take a bus home, took one and a half hours to get back.&nbsp; cheers     &nbsp;   watched vanilla sky just now.&nbsp; pirated cd again.&nbsp; fucking confusing show.&nbsp; managed to get most of the story down although i fast-forwarded for most of the show.&nbsp; didn't know that penelope cruz had a nude scene in there.&nbsp; it was a nice sight though.&nbsp; i thought she was ugly.&nbsp; but now i change my comments.&nbsp;&nbsp; and cameron diaz looked nice too.&nbsp; bleah.     &nbsp;   in two weeks time i would be sitting for a test.&nbsp; actually its many tests.&nbsp; 6 tests to be exact.&nbsp; 2 on a weekday and 4(?!) on saturday.&nbsp; what the fuck.&nbsp; the test(s) are supposed to prepare us for the prelims.&nbsp; yay.&nbsp; i actually think i can pass them.&nbsp; because there is no maths.    the only thing i'm worried about is elective history/social studies.&nbsp;    i can't understand what the fuck the teacher is talking about.&nbsp; she is mumbling to herself and when we ask her to speak louder, she says "this is the loudest i can go, if you want to hear me, you have to shut up."&nbsp; cool.&nbsp; and she always tells us to speak up when we speak to her... wonder why she can't speak up when she talks to us.&nbsp; so my history/ss is fucked.&nbsp; hopefully i can get my act together before the exams.&nbsp; and the exams are going to come fast.&nbsp; after the test, it's going to be the prelims immediately after the september holidays.&nbsp; then the o's are coming in november.&nbsp; think i really should consider studying.&nbsp; and my maths is(and have always been) fucked.

        since i was bored and had nothing to do, i decided to create another entry for today.  and since i probably won't be writing here tomorrow, because of the track and field cheerleading gay shit at the national stadium, which would mean that i would be home late at night, which would mean that i won't be online.  so for all the bored souls out there, this entry is for you. i have realised that satish is a very interesting person, and therefore, dedicate this entry to writing about him.  the following would include two true stories and one fictional story.         part 1: the grand theft.

       it's stupid to think that there isin't any other life forms in the universe other than that on earth.&nbsp; the universe is big.&nbsp; huge.&nbsp; enormous.&nbsp; infinite.&nbsp; how is it ever possible that life only occurred on earth?&nbsp; even if it was through a million/billion/trillion-in-one chance of happening, it would still somehow happen somewhere else out there.  maybe it's because humans have the need to feel 'special' that they&nbsp;make themselves believe that there isin't any other single population of intelligent life forms out there in the big black universe.   i wouldn't hesitate to call someone stupid if they do not believe that life exists elsewhere, away from this blue little planet.&nbsp; they would be either stupid or christian.&nbsp; basically christianity is based on the fact that god&nbsp;only created life on earth and no where else.&nbsp; i am a christian, but i think that the bible is not completely true.&nbsp; like how it&nbsp;says humans were created at the beginning of earth, and how the early humans could live for hundreds of years.&nbsp; in fact, the whole christian&nbsp;religion would be destroyed should there be any official discovery of life outside this planet. check out   urlLink  hubblesite.org   &nbsp;to see how big the universe actually is.&nbsp; earth is in  one  galaxy, which is already huge.&nbsp; i think that there is already other life in our galaxy, let alone the other  billions  of galaxys that dot the universe.&nbsp; and there are still other galaxys the lie outside our range of sight, because they are too far away for light to travel here.

       didn't write during the weekend.&nbsp; simply had no time to do it.&nbsp; went to the kindred spirits concert in school on saturday.&nbsp; it was boring.&nbsp; luckily i didn't&nbsp;waste $5&nbsp;on the tickets.&nbsp; simply walked in through the back entrance with some other guys.&nbsp; there were&nbsp;a whole bunch of girls there, some ugly and some pretty, but mostly ugly.&nbsp; who cares anyway.&nbsp; it's weird how girls can make loud shrieking noises without getting a sore throat.    the plays were boring, the instrumental shit were boring, the weird unintelligible singing was boring.&nbsp; the first band sucked, the second band didn't do too badly but the singing was horrible.&nbsp; and the dancing done with hotel california was disgusting.&nbsp; oh, and the singing was bad too.&nbsp; the hosts didn't do well too.&nbsp; they were trying too hard to sound interesting.&nbsp; sounded fake in the end.&nbsp; i think people should just speak like what they do normally.&nbsp; there is really&nbsp;no point in trying to be something that you are not.&nbsp; make you look hypocritical.&nbsp;&nbsp;bleah.&nbsp; people are going to hate me.   the only&nbsp;relatively interesting performance was the&nbsp;skit by the chinese language society.&nbsp; truthfully, it was interesting only because it made me laugh, as it was too damn lame.     &nbsp;   went to my grandmother's house on sunday.&nbsp; was there for the whole day so again,&nbsp;didn't have the chance to update this.&nbsp; i have been&nbsp;sick since last thursday, but it only got bad yesterday.&nbsp; down with the flu, coughing the day away.&nbsp; cannot make myself eat the medicine beacuse it is supposed to make me feel drowsy.&nbsp; i think that sleeping in the afternoon is a waste of my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;spending one-third of my life sleeping is already a large waste.&nbsp; there isin't the need to waste more time sleeping.&nbsp; maybe i would take it tonight...

       wow.&nbsp; look at this&nbsp;   urlLink  www.kfccruelty.com   .&nbsp; yuck.&nbsp; don't think i'm going to eat that for some time.&nbsp; i'm no chicken-lover, but this is just too much.&nbsp; cutting off beaks, stepping on them, and the bad living conditions...&nbsp; apprently they catch chickens by smashing them with a metal rod, thus breaking their bones, leaving them unable to escape.&nbsp; the chickens don't die until a few days later, when they are sent to the slaughter house.&nbsp; and chickens are not the only animals being tortured - almost all animals in factory-farms are tortured before they are finally killed.&nbsp; remember to watch the 'meet your meat' video on the site.&nbsp; then you know what i'm talking about.

       oh.&nbsp; i remembered that i went on a geography field trip to a meteorological station in changi, right&nbsp;beside the airport.&nbsp; spent about an hour traveling there in a smelly new bus.&nbsp;&nbsp;the place&nbsp;was small and the instruments were placed in a small open&nbsp;field beside the station.&nbsp;&nbsp;the trip was&nbsp;useless and i didn't learn anything from it at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;the instruments&nbsp;were all&nbsp;high-tech and automated, meaning that there wasn't much to see.&nbsp; for&nbsp;example, a little ufo shaped object sitting&nbsp;on top of a&nbsp;cylindrical stand was supposed to be for measuring air&nbsp;humidity or something.&nbsp; what.&nbsp; the.&nbsp; fuck.  and just as i was happy to leave the place, the driver brought us back to changi airport.&nbsp; we went to a small room which was supposed to be the place where they release weather information to the press.&nbsp; we watched a video about some storm that hit singapore in 2001 and then another one about lightning.&nbsp; retarded.  and there was this guy that was either inquisitive or just deprived.&nbsp; he simply had to look at everything there was to look at, and touch everything there was to touch.&nbsp; in the office, he touched and looked at stuff that did not concern him at all, such as the notes belonging to the workers and so on.&nbsp; what.&nbsp; the.&nbsp; fuck.   sji is a&nbsp;stupid school.&nbsp; being&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;"top" independent schools, they simply have to keep their rankings up.&nbsp; this means that they would have to force 'weaker' students to drop out or repeat school again, because if they&nbsp;fared badly in their o's, sji's rankings would fall.&nbsp; as said&nbsp;by my maths teacher, "for every f9 that is scored, 15 a1s is needed to pull the grades up."&nbsp; thiru has been made to repeat sec 3 starting monday, although many of my classmates think and know that there are many others that are doing much worse than him.&nbsp; so the school has just made him waste one year of his life.&nbsp; the fuckers could have&nbsp;made him repeat before the year started or even after the mid-year exmas, but they had to do it now.&nbsp; 3 months before the o's.&nbsp; what.&nbsp; the.&nbsp; fuck.  i think that it is the responsibility of all schools to help their students to the fullest extent.&nbsp; sji claimed they were helping him but he wasn't helping himself.&nbsp; even if that is true, as one of my classmates said, "you can bring the horse to the water but you can't force the horse to drink."&nbsp; therefore, i believe that the school is obligated to allow him to take the exams, and whether he does well or not, it's his own problem.&nbsp; but the fuckers didn't want that to happen because it would bring them the risk of dropping in the school rankings.&nbsp; what.&nbsp; the.&nbsp; fuck.  now i understand why the ministry wants to do away with the rankings.&nbsp; i say fuck the rankings and fuck sji.&nbsp; i is stupid to think that the rankings are more important than the welfare of the student.&nbsp; i don't think that it would help in any way for him to waste one year of his life.   i wonder if anyone is actually reading this blog.&nbsp; there isin't a point of writing if no one is reading right?&nbsp; so if you&nbsp;are reading this, drop a comment in so i can know if anyone does visit this blog at all.&nbsp; bleah.

       watched matchstick men just now.&nbsp; pirated dvds from indonesia are good.&nbsp; nice show, big twist in the end.&nbsp; can't believe the actress(alison lohman) is 25.&nbsp; she was playing the role of a 14 year old and i thought she really was around that age...    the racial harmony games today were really stupid and a bloody waste of time.&nbsp; i pity the older generation for having to play these retarded games.&nbsp; we did rope-skipping, some gay gunnysack racing thing&nbsp;and sepak takraw.&nbsp; can't be fucked to explain what they were about.&nbsp; overall, it was an enormous waste of time.&nbsp; ahhh. fuck it.    everyone go download the calander hung itself by bright eyes.&nbsp; download cause we're all cheap fucks that cannot be bothered to buy a cd with only a few good songs inside.&nbsp; it's such a nice song.&nbsp; whatever.&nbsp; just go download it.&nbsp; and listen.&nbsp; and listen again.&nbsp; and again.

       back to school, sucks as usual.&nbsp; i think that people work too much.&nbsp;&nbsp;you start school when&nbsp;you are 4 years old.&nbsp; considering the inclusion of university,&nbsp;you would finish&nbsp;your studies at about 23.&nbsp; then its off to find a job and work till you retire, probably at 65.&nbsp; so the average person spends 61 years of his/her life working.&nbsp; given the life expectancy rate of 75 years,&nbsp;you would&nbsp;waste 81.33% of&nbsp;your life&nbsp;working.  so what's the point of working this hard?&nbsp; some people say they work hard now to be able to enjoy their retirement&nbsp;but it's really hard to imagine what you could do when you're 65.&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore, i congratulate you for effectively wasting 61 years of your life to finally be able to have a 10 year holiday.  &nbsp;  found this from&nbsp;kontraband.com, authenticity is questionable.   - in lebanon, men are legally allowed to have sex with animals, but the animals must be female.&nbsp; having sexual relations with a male animal is punishable by death.  - in bahrain, a male doctor may legally examine a woman's genitals, but is prohibited from looking directly at them during the examination.&nbsp; he may only see their reflection in a mirror.  - muslims are banned from looking at the genitals of a corpse. &nbsp;this also applies to undertakers; the sex organs of the deceased must be covered with a brick or piece of wood at all times.  - the penalty for masturbation in indonesia is decapitation.  - there are men in guam whose full-time job is to travel the countryside and deflower young virgins, who pay them for the privilege of having sex for the first time.&nbsp; reason: under guam law, it is expressly forbidden for virgins to marry.  - in hong kong, a betrayed wife is legally allowed to kill her adulterous husband, but may only do so with her bare hands.&nbsp; the husband's lover, on the other hand, may be killed in any manner desired.  - topless saleswomen are legal in liverpool, england, but only in tropical fish stores.  - in cali, colombia, a woman may only have sex with her husband, and the first time this happens, her mother must be in the room to witness the act.  - in santa cruz, bolivia, it is illegal for a man to have sex with a woman and her daughter at the same time.  - in maryland, it is illegal to sell condoms from vending machines with one exception: prophylactics may be dispensed from a vending machine only "in places where alcoholic beverages are sold for consumption on the premises."  - banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour.&nbsp;  - humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure.

       congratulate me because my computer is dead again.&nbsp; writing this from the laptop.&nbsp; i'm rotting at home, as usual.&nbsp; sundays are usually full of boredom, partly because of the following week looming ahead.&nbsp; just the thought of&nbsp;going back to school&nbsp;spoils the day.  &nbsp;  anyway, found this on some forum...   1) triangular sandwiches taste better than square ones.  2) sharpening a pencil with a knife makes you feel really manly.  3) you're never quite sure whether it's against the law or not to have a fire in your back garden.  4) you never know where to look when eating a banana.&nbsp;  5) its impossible to describe the smell of a wet cat.  6) prodding a fire with a stick makes you feel manly.  7) you always feel a bit scared when stroking horses.  8) the most embarrassing thing you can do as schoolchild is to call your teacher mum or dad.  9) some days you see lots of people on crutches.  10) every man has at some stage while taking a pee, flushed half way through and then raced against the flush.  11) old women with mobile phones look wrong.  12) its impossible to look cool whilst picking up a frisbee.  13) driving through a tunnel makes you feel excited.  14) you never ever run out of salt.  15) old ladies can eat more than you think.  16) you can't respect a man who carries a dog.  17) there's no panic like the panic you momentarily feel when you've got your hand or head stuck in something.  18) no one knows the origins of their metal coat hangers.  19) the most painful household incident is wearing socks and stepping on an upturned plug.  20) people who don't drive slam car doors too hard.  21) you've turned into your dad the day you put aside a thin piece of wood specifically to&nbsp; stir paint with.  22) bricks are horrible to carry.  23) in every plate of chips there is a bad chip.  24) knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit; wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad.

       watched singapore idol? i didn't want to make myself suffer the pain of watching retarded countrymen and women singing their hearts out at first, but soon gave in to the temptation. and retarded it was. let's start with the judges. there were 4 of them, dick lee, a woman, a malay-looking man, and a fat man. obvioulsy out of the four, i only knew who dick lee was. or more like he was the only familiar name there. the only one that is worth talking about is the fat man. i think he was sincerely hoping that some contestant would walk up to him and give him a nice big punch in the face. that's what i was hoping for anyway. that guy was probably too worried that the contestants would laugh at him for being a fat ugly loser, so he had to protect himself by frowning and staring at them in the hardest way possible in order the gain the upper-hand. if he had done that to a bunch of stupid ah-bengs, he would most definitely get beaten up. the contestants were another retarded bunch, with too many trying too hard to be the fucking singapore verison of william fucking retard hung, whom if you haven't realised, is a fucking retard. nothing much to talk about here, they were just plain ol' self-delusional.  moving off topic... william hung IS a retard. anyone who says that he is a brave/sincere/whatever-else-except-retarded person would be a retard too. i believe that the only reason the american idol editors decided to allow him to have his 2 minutes of fame is to poke fun at asians. william hung is the traditional asian sterotype in the eyes of the americans; stupid, ugly, and most of all, retarded. best of all, he managed to get famous. famous because all the fucking americans were laughing at him for being the fucking retarded asian they've always had in their minds. shit turned into bigger shit as his name spread far and wide, like a fucking disease. he began to like his life, going to shows and getting his stupid ass laughed at, in exchange for money. actually it's quite a nice job. then he had fans. people who are either too stupid to realise he is retarded, or are pretending that he is a nice guy in order to laugh at him. william hung is so brave that he could go on tv to sing his fucking retarded song. yes, i know. william hung is so brave that he can allow a whole nation to laugh at him, and at the same time, not feel the humiliation of it. i love william too. i once laughed at him when i first saw him on tv. not because he was really funny, but because he was stupid enough to go on a talent contest to sing his 'song'. talentless person in a talent contest just don't match. self-delusional again. however, mister hung could be pulling the greatest scam the world has ever seen. maybe he is so smart that he had planned this all. get into american idol. be retarded. get famous. earn money. he would really be good if he did that, banking on his retardedness and the american love for asian dorks to earn a living.  top 10 bands (not in order)  afi godsmack the darkness guns n' roses modest mouse bright eyes slayer metallica system of a down  can't think of any more... screw this. stopping this top 10 shit. thinking of 10 things is too much work for my little brain.

       my family and my cousin's family are all watching the national day parade on tv. except me, for i own and use a brain. i seriously have no fucking idea what's so captivating about the stupid ndp. from the safety of my room, i can hear some retard shouting some commands, and some stupid trumpet sounds. how interesting indeed. even worse are those who actually GO to the parade. at least if you watch it at home, you can have the choice of turning the damn tv off when you get sick of all the retards running around like beheaded chickens. but at the stadium, you have no choice but to watch. oops, i forgot. these people actually ENJOY watching it.    go hear the new version of kit chan's home and feel the uncontrollable spasms taking over your body. the song was disgusting enough before, but the smart asses had to make it more disgusting by getting some stupid kids to sing it. what's the damn point of this? maybe because kids are sooo cute and adorable, that singaporeans would feel happy that their country managed to produce such sweet little things who would be the bright future of singapore. but the kids were stupid and ugly, with retarded whiny voices. i cringe at the thought that these retards would be the future of singapore. fortunately i've only had the chance of hearing it once.    the song is stupid and meaningless. where the river always flows? flow my ass. that canal wouldn't ever qualify as a fucking river. and it's smelly and dirty. but lets assume that it's a river anyway. so how would that fucking river affect our lives? how would that river make singapore our home? by stinking the place up? how nice.    if hanging the national flag would be a way to see who gives a fuck about the country, then people clearly don't give a fuck. go look out of your window and see how many people bothered to fly their flags. singaporeans were never patriotic anyway. if they really loved the country, they would have been booing the japanese soccer team like china did, instead of cheering for them. singaporeans are just too comfortable living in this little shell, with the reality of the world blocked out by our 'super efficient' government. they just work and let the government do the rest. in fact, i believe they have little idea what the government actually does with their tax money.    but what makes singapore lovable enough for us to feel patroitic towards it anyway? the kiasu and selfish people? or the super-hectic lifestyle of the country? people spend their time working, working and working, that they do not realise that this country is not as good as it seems. they are too busy to realise that singaporeans are very ugly people. they do not realise that they are spending their lives working, only to end up with nothing. people say they work hard to enjoy their retirement, why not enjoy life now instead of looking forward to something that might not even happen. you could just die anytime. heart attack, accidents, terrorist attacks, the possibilities are countless. i might just die after typing this sentence, who knows?      SHIT! home is being sung by the retards now... whiny little shits. hope someone at the parade tells them to shut the fuck up. opps, they actually ENJOY listening to whiny meaningless songs.       went skating again this morning. got the joy of having an overweight fat fat fuck to come and tell us to go away. it must have been hard work for him to get out of bed, dress, then haul his fat ass down. being the good citizens that we are, we kindly walked away. then some retarded bald nigger shouted something like "use your fucking brains lah basket!" or something to that extent from the safety of his flat and quickly hid himself. the pussy didn't even have the guts to come down and say it in our face. stupid shit.

       i think people would notice that there are more and more MEN wearing   PINK   (my first coloured text EVER) shirts these days. maybe they think it's cool. or they think that wearing   PINK   shirts makes them a 'sensitive new-age guy'. or they wore their sister's/mother's/girlfriend's/wife's/grandmother's shirts by mistake. or even perhaps because they accidently spilled some bandung on their shirts, then decide that the only way to correct the problem is by spilling more bandung on it to make it entirely   PINK  . but let me tell all you stupid   PINK  -wearing faggots this : REAL MEN DON'T WEAR   PINK  ! why? it's because   PINK   is ONLY worn by lil' girls and some ol' women that aspire to be cute again. basically,   PINK   is a colour that is ONLY acceptable when worn on a female. so unless you're gay, NEVER wear   PINK  . wearing   PINK   won't make you look like a 'sensitive new-age guy'. it only makes you look like a sensitive new-age faggot. there are probably 20,000 other colours that are available choices for men, and   PINK   is not one of them. so next time you ever see any of your friends dressed in   PINK  , give him a slap on the head, or even a punch in the gut, and tell him that REAL MEN DON'T WEAR   PINK  ! of course, only do this to your friends and not some random   PINK  -wearing faggot you see on the street. i won't want to be held responsible for you being gang-raped by a   PINK  -wearing faggot gang.  anyway, school was relatively painless today. only from 8:30am to about 10. don't even see the point of being there. brought most of my books home, in case i'm in a good mood and wish to spoil it by studying. would probably be going on a late night/early morning skate later tonight/tomorrow morning.  top 10 hates (not in order)  pink-wearing faggots george bush saddam hussien retarded islamic extremists retarded 'gangstas' that rap about their dogs stupid people that think they're cool sji gays trend-followers people that make me feel stupid*  *see below i hate it when people make me feel stupid although they are the ones that are truely retarded. i have 3 examples to show this. primary 2 - i said "colleague" is pronounced as it is, and a friend said that it was pronounced as "college". i insisted and he went on to ask some other retards, who all agreed that it was pronounced as "college". secondary 1 - i saw a kingfisher perched on top of the rugby posts, and pointed it out to my classmate. the fucktard said that a kingfisher is a BIG bird and that the tiny blue bird is not a kingfisher. he then procceded to ask other retards, who agreed that a kingfisher is a BIG bird.   secondary 4 - i said that sri lanka is a country. a retard said that it's part of india. he then asked another retard, who said that sri lanks IS part of india. he then asked our geography teacher, who said that sri lanka is a country. the retards then asked if it WAS part of india, to which she said yes. they then said that they were right that sri lanka is part of india. however, i suppose that their brains are lagging by a few decades, because sri lanka was only part of india when they were colonialised by britain a long long time ago.   therefore, you can see why i hate to be made felt stupid by a bunch of brainless stupid people.

       each day, we get shit from the world. the whole world is full of shit. we get shit from wars, shit from the middle east, shit from islamic extremists, shit from usa, shit from george fucking retard bush, shit from teachers, shit from friends, shit from bad blogs. fortunately, you won't get any shit from me. even if it's shit, it would be interesting shit. so i guess that's good.      great news: afi is actually becoming nice. modest mouse IS nice.   good news: 5 days of holidays coming up.   relatively good news: i've just watched naked weapon(pirated cd), and AGAIN, i swear i didn't know that there were 2 nude scenes in it, since it was showing in cinemas with a pg rating(i think). and maggie q is HOT.   bad news: tests are on the saturday after national day holidays, and the following saturday.   fucking bad news: prelims are approximately 1 month and 1 week away.   great joke: assistant principal aka goh poh kenn wants us to study "at least 8 to 9 hours a day" during the 5 day break. haha.      anyway, some quotes i found from the net.   -it's better to be black than gay because when you're black you don't have to tell your mother. -if i were to point fingers at you, it would definitely be the middle one. -if anything was deformed, it would have to be your face. -i believe that sex is a beautiful thing between two people. between five, it's fantastic. -don't have sex. it leads to kissing and pretty soon you have to start talking to them. -if it wasn't for pick-pockets i'd have no sex life at all. -i'm glad i'm not bisexual. i couldn't stand being rejected by men as well as women. -last week i stated that this woman was the ugliest woman i had ever seen. i have since been visited by her sister and now wish to withdraw that statement. -show me a woman who doesn't feel guilt and i'll show you a man. -an archaeologist is best husband a woman can have: the older she gets, the more interested he is in her. -if a woman insists on being called ms, ask her if it stands for miserable. -when a man steals your wife there is no better revenge than to let him keep her. -some people ask the secret of our long marriage. we take time to go to a restaurant two times a week. a little candlelight, dinner, soft music and dancing. she goes tuesdays, i go fridays.      top 10 movies (not in order)      american pie   american pie 2   american pie 3   dawn of the dead   the matrix   the matrix reloaded   the matrix revolutions   scary movie 3   spiderman   spiderman 2      fuck. these movies suck. except for american pie(s) and matrix revolutions. and dawn of the dead. don't watch much movies anyway. if i do, it's probably non-memorable ones. or movies downloaded from kazaa. or pirated cds.      realised many people think that gayfag does not really exist or that it's my idea of a joke. bleah.

       fuck. just woke up at 8:30 after falling asleep at 5:30 while waiting for my brother to finish using the laptop. now my head hurts. that's why i hate to sleep in the afternoon. i've realised that the only way to prevent the headache is to sleep till late, like 10:30pm or something.  the modest mouse cd is nice. actually it's good (good is better than nice?). afi is still failing to meet my expectations... well, still hoping that it would grow into me.  anyway, realised that the tests are on 2 saturdays, and there would be 3 on each day. instead of 2 on a weekday and 4 on a saturday, which is  slightly  better than i thought. again, i might be wrong, as things have been screwed up for me lately. bleah. fuck it.  thought of this yesterday. starting today, and for the next 9 days, there would be a 10 top 10, which is a list of 10 of my top 10 likes (eg. top 10 songs, etc). and since this is MY blog, don't bother telling me that anything sucks or whatever.  top 10 songs (not in order)  afi - this time imperfect bright eyes - the calendar hung itself godsmack - serenity the darkness - love is only a feeling system of a down - toxicity the who - behind blue eyes school of rock (theme song?) modest mouse - the ocean breathes salty placebo - every me every you guns n' roses - think about you  i forgot to add   urlLink  milla jovovich    to the list of babes... appeared in the fifth element and resident evil. and i actually had something interesting to write. but the sleep erased my memory. hopefully i can remember it by tomorrow.

       yay. i'm happy. bought 2 cds today from tower records in suntec city. that brings my total (original) cd collection to 3. bought 2 since there was a 20% discount for buying 2. bleah. i'm cheap. anyway, bought afi's sing the sorrow and modest mouse's good news for people who love bad news for $19.95 and $18.40 respectively, after discount. the prices are good, considering that hmv has them in the $30s... so now i'll never buy from hmv again. currently listening to afi... all seems well. now they can join my godsmack's faceless cd.  i'm finally totally convinced that kefli is a fucking loser. kefli is my english teacher. he took over my class last year, and also teaches elective geography. i've heard bad things about him from the geography class, but haven't really witnessed anything bad from him. until today... the trouble started during last year's final year exams. he told the geography class that tourism wasn't tested, but tourism WAS tested. most of the students didn't study tourism because they believed him and so they pushed the blame onto him, which i think is the right thing to do. however, he denied telling them that tourism wasn't tested. kefli also developed the 'stab-in-the-back' theory, believing that his students ganged up agaisnt him. so this year, he became somewhat cautious, but all was still fine. until recently, where the damn deputy principal became more interested in our studies. he then became very uptight and constantly threatened to "refer you to her" if we failed to meet his 'expectations'.    then yesterday, sec 4's had a talk about the coming english oral. and i realised that it was picture  discussion  instead of description, which he had taught us to do during the prelim orals. not surprisingly, i did badly in it. then today, he gave out some handouts which contained passages to practice. since there were no picture  discussions , i asked "how about the picture discussions? i think they are more important." to which he replied "i will give them to you in the future.", and i said "but there isin't much time left." those words caused something to snap in his sick and twisted mind. he then went on and on about who was wasting all the time this year, about us not doing english homework, and talking in class. the irony was that HE was the one wasting most of our time. we DO talk in class, but because his 'class' only consists of 4 members. and he doesn't teach them. the fuckhead talks to them. rubbish like phantoms in the classroom, jokes, even about velvet revolver/guns n' roses. cool. and HE was the one who came into class talking about wanting to punch some student's face and break his nose or teeth, saying that he would be satisfied even if he got into trouble. HE was the one giving 30 minute talks about how he would prefer to teach our class rather than 410. he says that people stab him in the back, but he too does the same thing, talking shit about 410 behind their backs. like how the students there are stupid to believe that they can inherit their parents' companies and how they do not listen to him in class. my friend from 410 told me that he gives them primary 6 exam papers to do, and then writes the answers on the board for them. talk about gayness. and the biggest irony: he wasted 10 minutes talking about NOT wasting time. wow. to read more shits about him, visit   urlLink  ross_lee.blogspot.com   .      sad to say this, but from the 30 minutes spent on writing this, while listening to afi at the same time, it doesn't sound too good. hopefully it would grow into me...   anyway, i found out that blogger doesn't allow double spaces any more. wtf. that's why when you read my old posts, there would be double spaces after each full-stop. and i think it's easier to read with double spaces too. unfortunately, blogger is gaiz and don't allow it.   oh yes, i have 3 tests tomorrow. 1 additional maths, on matrices and shit and 2 history tests, on china and long march. bleah. how unfortunate.

       shit. english oral is next week. shit. i hate oral, always have nothing to say, be it picture  discussion  or the conversation. maybe it's because i don't talk much. in school, it's ok, because there are actually people to talk to. at home, there is simply no one to talk to. brother? no. nothing to talk about. sister? no. hate her. maid? bleah. mother? only comes home at night when i half-dead. father? working in china. so i normally just surf the net for the whole day and then if i'm feeling happy, do some homework, or else i'll go to sleep at about 11pm. so over the years, my level of speech and communication has fallen considerably. can't seem to articulate some words properly and shit like that. and the bad thing is there would be 2 examiners there, sitting in front of me, focusing on my every word. that's twice the pain. the chinese oral passed quite painlessly, mainly because i sucked so much that it was over in no time.  anyway, after being tired for so many days and unable to write some decent shits here, today i'm fine. and so i'll bring to you, beauty, in my own humble opinion. ever so often, my friends would point out that so and so is pretty/beautiful/whatever, or point out certain girls on the street and say that she is pretty/beautiful/whatever. then most of the time, i'll say "yuck!". so here, i bring to you, a list of girls that i think are pretty/beautiful/whatever. keep in mind that this is in my own opinion, so don't bother telling me that so and so is ugly.  not in any particular order,    urlLink  chisato morishita    - japanese model   urlLink  elisha cuthbert    - 24, the girl next door   urlLink  keira knightley    - king arthur, bend it like beckham   urlLink  samaire armstrong    - the oc   urlLink  emmanuelle vaugier    - smallville   urlLink  chantille boudousque    - are you hot?   urlLink  sophie marceau    - die another day, braveheart   urlLink  catherine zeta-jones    - zorro, entraptment   urlLink  nicole kidman    - too many to remember   urlLink  cameron diaz    - there's something about mary, vanilla sky   urlLink  kate beckinsale    - underworld      ps. the names are lickable. yes, i said lick. lick on the names to see pic.  with my excellent newly-aquired maths skills, the probability of me getting any one of these hot babes is - P(getting 1 of 11 hot, sexy, beautiful girls) = 1/11. therefore, the chances are 1 in 11, which are quite damn good. i was just being self-delusional, just like many of the american idol hopefuls, who think that they are capable to be the next american idol. anyway, i think that any girl half as hot as the above 11 is fine with me. actually i ought to look in the mirror before talking so much shit. but i can always hope. and hope.

       went on a late night/early morning (whichever you prefer) skate with fat fuck. started at 3:30am, and finished at about 6:30. i think everyone should at least go out in the early pre-dawn hours to experience how nice and peaceful everything is. bleah... i'm feeling gay now. but it's true. the whole place was quiet and empty... cool. then got home, fat fuck played fifa while i just sat around. he had to leave at 7:30 because he sneaked out last night/this morning and had to get home before his parents were awake. then i slept from 9 to 1:30. it's back to school again tomorrow. fuck.
