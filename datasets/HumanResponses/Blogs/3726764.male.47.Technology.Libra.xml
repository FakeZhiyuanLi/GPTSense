						   As you can see, I didn't get around to posting anything yesterday. I was a zombie all day. Was up 'til 3:00 a.m. the night before and up at 8:00 a.m. It wasn't the lack of sleep that affected me. It was the staying up so late. I didn't do much all day. In fact, I haven't done much for the past couple weeks. It has been nice being lazy and not obligated or responsible to do anything but it's gotten old and today I'm bored. I did go out to Sam's Club and got a phone card and over to Walmart and got a nice big pot and stand for the new rubbertree I bought Thursday when Mom was in town. I have it replanted already but came up a little short on potting soil. It'll lst 'til tomorrow when I go out again. It's another one of those stupid people days here in St.Cloud. The way people drive and things they do just reeks if stupidity. That's not to be confused with ignorance. Ignorance doesn't know. Stupidity knows but don't think. I think I'm gonna pass my blog URL on to Louie so she can keep up on what's happening without writing me. I know she gets busy with her family etc. and doesn't have much time to write. Hard to imagine that in another 2 months, we will have been friends for 30 years. I don't think she knows, but back then, I gave her a special place in my heart and no one has ever been allowed there since. I still hold the fond memories there of when we were a couple and even today, I often think of her. I respect her more than anyone except Mom. Once, I let my emotions get out of hand and almost scared Louie off. It was stupid of me. I love her as the oldest and dearest friend I have. I wonder how long we'll stay in touch or if we'll drift apart someday. Who knows what's gonna happen after I get out of school next Winter or where I'll end up or what kind of job I'll have. It's scary! As morbid as it sounds, I figure I only have to do it a few years anyway. Reason being; my dad and his dad both died at 55 years old of sudden heart attacks. I'm guessing there's something hereditary there and with my smoking habit, I expect to follow tradition. More later (or tomorrow)

						   What a beautiful sunny morning. A little on the cool side. 49 degrees F. when I got up at 6:10 this morning. So far, I've read my morning email, vacuumed, dusted, cleaned a fishbowl, took a shower and took out the garbage. Exciting start for the day, hey? I do have to start getting to bed earlier at nights, though. I don't knnow why, but for the past week or so, I haven't been getting tired until 1:00 on the morning. Makes it hard to get up at 6am. I always say I'm a morning person but that doesn't mean I'm pleasent in the mornings. Just means I like to get up early in the mornings. Don't f**k with me until I've had a couple cups of coffee (Folgers) and a cigarette. The rental agent called yesterday morning and wanted to know if it was ok for her to bring the mortgage people up to my apartment this morning and let them see it. Apparently, this is an annual thing. They come and check out a couple apartments and take a picture or 2. I think it has something to do with assessing the depreciation or value of the building. I don't really know. I'm sure the rental agent selected my apartment because I always keep it so clean and have had many people compliment me on my decor. In fact, everyone compliments me on it. Several even say I missed my calling and should have been an interior decorator. I dunno. I can't see that as steady, good income. Besides, I can decorate my place so well because I know my "tastes" and what I like and don't like. I don't think it's possible to decorate for someone else unless you know them well. That's all for now. I may post again later today. Mom is coming down from her lake home for a visit and do some big-city errands and shopping. I expect her pretty soon, too. I love life!

						   Welcome to any and all who come to visit my very first blog. I'm totally new to this so it'll take me some time to figure it all out. I'm not much for reading instructions so I'll be learning by trial and error and example. Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

						      I'm home now after spending Monday and Tuesday night at Mom's lake home. I'm tired and my back is bothering me but I had a good time. Caught a few nice bass, did some chores for Mom (a few more than my back wanted me to)and camped out in my tent. It was nice going to sleep to the sound of the loons howling across the lake and waking to the songs of the Purple Martens. The neighbor next door learned that Purple Martens eat lotsa mosquitos so he has 2 big Purple Marten Hotels in his back yard. Bats are better at eating mostitos but I'm not gonna tell this guy. Talk amongst the neighboring people is a black bear has been seen in the area a couple times. Mom said she heard it Tueday night. We went looking for tracks but didn't see any. Daniel Boone woulda fired me as a tracker.    Tom and Becky and their kids are flying into the cities tomorrow and renting a car for the week to go up to Mom's. They shipped out some of their stuff via UPS.The best thing about doing this instead of driving out is they don't spend 4 of their vacation days traveling in a car. Makes sense. They'll follow me up since Becky isn't really sure if she remembers the way or not. I'll be coming back Sunday. I need a full day to recouperate and prepare for my first day of Simmer school on Tuesday. Haven't decided if I'm going up the following weekend to spend a couple more days with Tom and Becky and the kids. They're a fun bunch and I really like hanging around them. Maybe it's because they both have a good sense of humor and obviously enjoy joking around and having fun. They're good at mixing it with seriousness. I sometimes think I don't take enough things seriously. But heck, laughing feels good.   Holy babbles, Batman! What was going to be just a short, quick post has turned into....well, lots more than I intended. More when I get back sunday. Oh yeah...I sure am enjoying the 80+ degree temps we've had the past few days.

						   I've been up since 6. It's a beautiful morning and they're talking that Summer will finally get here this week with temps up to the 80's. Hope the rain stays away. I got my mail read and getting things together to go up and spend a few days at the lake. Hope to be gone before noon. I'll be back prolly Wednesday to feed my fish (2 bettas and several different kinds of tetras) and check my mail and prolly wash a few clothes. Then I'll go back up Thursday or Friday for the weekend. Tom and Becky and the kids are flying in to the Cities from Ohio and renting a car and driving up Friday. Hope they have a nice sunny dry week of vacation. My Sumsmer class starts a week from tomorrow and I want to get some serious fishing and vacationing in before then. It's only a 1 month class running from 8:30 to noon on Monday through Thursday so I could still spend a few long weekends up there. Then I have a break before Fall classes start. I think about 3 weeks. That's it for now. Today's thought of the day is from Albert Einstein:                  "We cannot solve our problems with             the same level of thinking that created them."                       ~ Albert Einstein ~  Makes sense, doesn't it. Such a statement tells me to "think outside the box"...the basis for linear thinking...something I always try to do.

						   Jeepers. I just read yesterday's post. I guess I went over the deep end a little. I could edit the post but, naw. That's what was going through my mind at the time. What's going through my mind today? Well, it's been a not-quite normal Sunday so far. It was raining when I got up at 6 this morning. Strike 1. Went for coffee and there was someone else sitting in my usual booth. Strike 2. Not a good way to start my Sunday. Then there were 3 fat, ugly women who were loud and obnoxious. Not the kind of people or noise I want to put up with anytime of the day, let alone my Sunday morning. Strike 3. Went and got groceries and picked up some potting soil, next door at ShopoKo. Maybe I'll just stay indoors today. Read most my morning email and here I am doing a friggin blog post. I wonder how long I'll keep it up. I better get this blog address off to Louie or she'll be writing, wondering what's going on and why I don't write. Maybe I'll post again later today. Maybe not.

						      ...I make a new post to my blog. Had a good time up at the lake home with family. Did a little fishing, sunning and, of course, work. A couple of days were cloudy, rainy and/or cool. Had my first day of Summer school Tuesday. By the end of the first hour, I decided to drop the class and test out of it. The class moves way to slow, is way too easy, and the teacher is a major bore. By the next day, I had wished I hadn't dropped it. I needed it for something to do. I'm also concerned testing out may not be that easy. Last night, I checked into the availability of the class this Fall. The only possible opening I can use (with a different instructor) is at 7 in the morning and overlaps my Network Admin class by about 20 minutes. I think I'll be able to convince the instructors to let me take it and cut out of one class early and/or get to the other class a little late. Now I need to find something else productive to to until Fall classes start. Maybe I'll get out some of my old text books and do some reading. Also have some tweaking to do on my desktop pc. I just don't want to get lazy and vegetate. I see my profile here has been viewed a few times by others. It'd be nice if someone had something to say about any of my blogs. Even if just to tell me they read them. Oh well. I guess I was just hoping for a little more interaction with others through my blog. Not that big of a deal. Time to get busy doing something now.

						   And a good morning it is. I didn't get around to posting anything yesterday. Had a bad case of the unmotivationals. Feeling better today. It's sunny and hot. I have the ac on already. Here's something I've noticed about my typing: when I type the word "becasue", the 'S' always ends up ahead of the 'U'. Even when I think about it. It's just one of those quirky things about my fingers. they have a mind of their own. Saturday, I spent a couple hours trying to figure out how to add my photo to my profile and/or blogs. I downloaded that "hello" program but still can't figure out how to post my pic. If anyone ever reads this and can give me some pointers, I would greatly appreciate it. I scanned through a few blogs of other people too. Jeepers. Many of them had comments on their blogs. Maybe mine is so dull it doesn't merit any comments. No big deal. I don't really write this for others anyway. I gotta get to the school today and see if I can get into the class I dropped this Summer, this Fall with a different teacher. It's a wonderful day in the neighborhood. Enjoy it!

						   Not much to say today. I'm restless and bored but limited as to what I can do. This disability might be a free ticket through school, but I'm paying for it in other ways. I'm getting old and soft and it bothers me I can't be more active and do the things I used to do. I've noticed an increase of about 10-15 pounds in the past 2-1/2 years and it's not becasue I'm eating more. Others say I look good with the added weight because I was too thin before. That's all I have to say about any of that...at least for now.

						   ...here in St.Cloud. I got home from 3 nice days at the lake Saturday noon and have been lazy since. Today is catch-up day. I already have laundry done, the floors swept, washed and waxed. Still hafta dust and vacuum and I shold prolly clean the fish tank. The stores are having their first back-to-school sales of the season. It reminds me I need to get my books for my Fall classes yet plus any notebooks/folders etc. I may need. I met a nice girl online last night from Virginia Beach, VA. It was nice to have someone to talk to as I do get lonely for conversation at times. I sensed she wants more but I have negative feelings about online romances. Experienced a few myself. Anyone who wants to know more can ask. It's a great way to meet people and get acquainted but unless you live close enough to date and interact in person, there's a lot you will never learn about the other person from the internet. I know of at least 2 online romances that turned into happy marriages. But I know of lots more that turned into disappointment and heartbreak. I'm trying to steer my blog in the direction of thoughts, feelings, and opinions rather than just a boring chronological diary of my daily activities. Input from others would make it easier. Today's thought... ...Today is like no other. And in a mere 24 hours, it will be history. Things will happen that can never be changed. Opportunities will come around that will never come around again. The clock is ticking. When I am laying on my deathbed, I hope the list of things I regret not doing is smaller than the list of regrets of the things I've done.

						   ...Sometimes my mind runs off in weird directions thinking of the oddest things at the oddest times. The way I see it, the greatest feeling in the world is the first time someone you really, really like discovers how you feel for them, the same time you discover that they really, really like you. And the neatest thing is, most people get to experience this feeling several times. The sad thing is, once you get married, you never(almost, usually) get to experience that feeling again. Another good excuse for me still being single.

						   ...rubber tree I paid $8 bucks for 2 weeks ago is thriving! It was dirty and sickly looking thing when I bought it at Shop Ko. Prolly why they sold it so cheap. I brought it home, washed the fronds with milk, replanted it in a larger prettier pot, and it's sprouted 6 new fronds since.
