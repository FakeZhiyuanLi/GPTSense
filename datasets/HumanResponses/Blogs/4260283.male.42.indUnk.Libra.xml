      working late. nothing unusal there - must stop doing it though. annoyingly i am off tomorrow so by working this late, its nearly midnight i shall be knackered tomorrow. still taking this opportunity to order some stuff off of play.com - the best internet site in the whole world at least when it comes to me parting with my money. so what am i getting? as you have asked so nicely i will tell you. Dysrhythmia - Pretest - the reviews seemed interesting so i thought why the hell not. i am sure i will regret it. Charlie Watts - Watt's At Scott's - this isn't actually for me but for a friend (honest guv) Fred Frith / John Zorn Duo - 50th Birthday Celebration Vol.5 - i love john zorn the noise is wonderful. i probably have more john zorn than any other musician (frank zappa and merzbow are probably the next two). now i just have to get the other 4 cd sets in the 50th birthday release.  right enough of this wibbling about on here - time to finish off and go home. oh ok one more coffee as well

      i have a love hate relationship with computers. they know this and every so often they crash and burn on me. in recent months i have had to replace 2 cd drives, have a new hard drive installed and this ignores all the programme quirks that seem only to happen to me. the box has only just come back from our IT maintaince guys last week.  so when i was searching for iampat on google (ok i admit it i am vain) and had one of those annoying websites that just won't go away, so much so i had to go to task manager to get rid of it.  on exiting that i discovered that my screen had flipped so that everything was upside down. the mouse worked upside down and it was very hard to get it to go anywhere i wanted it. oh no i thought annoying website has given me a stupid virus and this is what it does. turn off machine. reboot it. mmmm so far so good. bugger. its still upside down.  have to phone the IT bods - the shame of it.  only to discover that this pointless thing - the turning of your screen upside down is actually a thing you can make the computer do (alt-control- up/down arrow keys). what in the name of spiro agnew is that for, what purpose can it serve. tell me tell me.  like i say i love to hate my computer.

      a surge of national pride went through me yesterday morning. its is talked about in terms of you will remember where you were when ....... like most people that will be easy for me to do - i was in my flat listening to it on the radio. just like four years ago i was in my flat watching sir steve win his fifth gold.  i caught the very end of cracknell, pinsentt and the other two blokes (well who is going to remember them ? but for the sake of it all ed coode and steve williams) did the job and won gold. i am not a rowing fan so know little about the sport. there had been a lot of talk in the run up to this event about the upsets, arguments and tooing and frooing as to who were going to make up the 4 who rowed on saturday. one of the guys who was supposed to row, alax partridge, was being interviewed throughout the week as the team rowed. it was somehow sad and wonderful to hear him talk about it - knowing that his chance for glory was not going to come this year but wanting his his team, training partners and friends to win. alex was online as the 4 won and it was a poignant moment, made even more so by the fact that all the rowers seemed genuinely concerned about him (they had named the boat after him), and they expected him to be rowing with them for gold at the beijing olympics in 2008.  i will confess to having a tear in my eye as i listened. partly because of the one left behind, partly because of pinsent's achievement of winning 4 golds in 4 olympics, and partly because of national pride.  what is even more amazing is that as we win gold medals in all these less than fashionable events you just know that their achievements will be soon forgotten by the majority of us as they are not football players, cricketers, runners in the athletics...... which is a shame. the other thing about what they have done is the way they talk about it the hard work, the gearing up for this one event that takes place every 4 years, the hours of training the dedication, the sacrifice. and i can't help but think that is the difference between them and the rest of us - it isn't always the talent and skills to do the task but the dedication and the motivation to actually see it through no matter what the costs are.  i raise my virtual hat to messers cracknell, coode, pinsent and williams long may you enjoy the glory.  now lets hope paula wins.

      well after the adventures of thursday night/ friday morning i just knew there was going to be trouble ahead. i was meeting up with a friend for a coffee and a curry in the evening - ah the joys of brick lane, a magical place that holds so much - a great coffee shop, a veritable legion of curry houses and it's a haven for the arty farty crowd. the work day was pants mainly because i had had very little sleep so i was happy to see the back of the place and get out and see joel. we were both still amped about seeing dio the previous week - and to be honest it was just truly awesome, to quote an old school friend it was a "BRAINBLAST". as ever our conversations revolved around music, work - mainly the problems of work, art and a few other things. one of the things i have noticed about my life is that as i have gotten older i have less dreams in life - i remember at school hanging around with people like joel and adam and having dreams about being a writer, a photographer and a bass player in a rock and roll band (i had long since given up wanting to be an astronaut). in someways meeting up with joel once a fortnight is a way back to those dreams. i never expect to be a published writer or sought after photographer but at least now i have started doing both again. (what of the bass guitar you ask - hell no, i struggled to play the bassline on smoke on the water so that was pretty much a sign from above to stick to air guitar!)  the coffee went well, the curry went well and was very nice. except that both of us had ordered too much to eat. not really sure why joel couldn't finish his - but me it was because somewhere during the evening i had developed a bad case of wind - but not the sort you can easily let out. i think i bloated out a little as we sat and ate. but aside from a little discomfort it was fine and the evening was good.  a short trip to a local pub (apparently tracey emin's local) and then home.  i made it home with what must have been seconds to spare. as i sat on the toilet my arse erupted in a mix of vile noises and heinous stenches - imagine the sounds and smells of a festering primordial bog land and it comes close. i felt like i was deflating. and i was there for a loooooooooooooooooooong time, each eruption slightly less extreme than the one before. when i eventually got of the toilet to flush - it was as if jackson pollock had decorated the inside of the toilet bowl. i had to make two more trips to the toilet before i felt it was safe to go to bed.  saturday was pretty much me recovering from whatever it was that turned me into a human version of mount vesuvius.

      during last night's missed night bus adventure i stopped off at the famous brick lane beigel bar in order to grab some food and an industrial strength but not very tasty coffee. from there i walked home. obviously for the young and the beautiful thursday night at 4am is the normal kick out time from the local clubs. so brick lane was brisk with people walking home (after having had a better evening out than i had had!) the thing about brick lane and spitalfields is the amazing mix of old and new , modern and traditional. so you have new fashionably designed loft apartments (tracey emin lives in one of those - so i have been told), butting up against old style elegant townhouses next to council properties. small indian resturants vie with plush large trendy eateries. style victim shops sit opossite clothes shops where your granny goes to buy her undies and such like. in short its an area of contrasts. its also an area that is supposed to have a large proportion of the east end 10,000 artists, you won't be surprised to learn that i want to become one of that group! its an area that has seen much change and is still seeing change - from the communities who live there to the types of things that have gone on there. with that in mind it is nice to see that some things never really change that much. the commercial is still the place to see prostitutes - some young some old, some thin some fat, some drop dead gorgeous others looking like they have had several whacks of the ugly stick. last night as i walked home munching on my beigels i saw 4 ladies of the night. only one of them asked if i was looking for business. its comforting to know that under the shadow of hawksmoor's christchurch prostitutes still ply their trade and that as the various jack the ripper walks wend their way through the streets they can point to the working girls and say mmm look some things never change.

      our lives are made up of moments. all of them fleeting, some happy, some sad, some important, some just fluff. some moments can change the way you think for the rest of your life. other moments can just reinforce the lessons of life.  last night was a case in point. i was out late in a part of london i do not go to often. so i needed the night bus to get home. i had confirmed there was a bus stop i could use near to where i was and it had a night bus going in my direction, even made a note of the times it ran so i could be there for it. so far so good. the event ends and i toodle along to the bus stop. i wait. patiently. i am thinking about how much i like being out in the city late at night. i am thinking how quite this part of north london is, i am thinking blimey its chilly. a bus approaches i stick my arm out it keeps going, even without all its lights nice and bright i can see it is the 55 and i can see its for oxford circus. i am less than happy as i want to get home to go to sleep as i had work later. so thats me at 2am. so i decide,in frustration, to phone london transport's information line. and a helpful man (ross) told me that the 55 was running - just it was delayed. i thanked him and ho hummed. i heard a bus approaching from behind me, i turned to look and see the bus that was on the other side of the road going in the opposite direction to the one i was waiting for the 55 going to oxford circus. of course by the time my sleep deprived brain could work out what was going on the bus had reached its stop and had moved on. bugger.  so what does this moment show ? well it shows and confirms that the luck of pat comes in two kinds none and bad.  so another 30-40 minutes later there is the bus i want. then home to bed. get to sleep at 4am.  i woke up to the sound of the radio blaring and the feeling my bed was on fire. very odd.

      a few days back i went to see ronni jame dio - a little man with a mighty mighty voice - live in concert. i had given up going to gigs several years back but there was something special, something awesome about going to see the man whose voice has been there through much of my musical listening career. he was there when i air guitared to rainbow. he moved on to black sabbath and then he formed his owned band. the one constant through it all was his great voice (and his fascination with rainbows).  and to see him live, ah it was a treat. by the third song he had already done two classics that i had never expected to hear. it was a set of classics. it was a set that demanded air guitar histronics, fierce headbanging and demonic hand gestures. it was a thing of beauty, a thing of joy and i am still reliving it now.  two random thoughts about gigs - its nice to see the lighter has been replaced by the picture phone its not quite as romantic and moving but seems more in keeping with the times. and i really do think heavy metal bands should be looking to get some sponsorship from people such as timotei and head and shoulders - there is a lot of hair at a heavy metal gig and a big percentage of it gets well and truly sweaty.  i salute you ronnie james dio it was a gig worthy of the immortals.

      i like london transport .... well i have to as i use it a lot. thanks to a situation of financial embarrassment (all of my own making) i am forced to use the buses instead of the tube. now the main bus for me is the 25 and its an odd bus, not just because of its number, but because of its inability to keep to a schedule, its desire to travel in packs (though i am not sure what the predator of the 25 is) and the fact that they seem to keep changing it. recently it has gone from double decker - which made it easy to spot at night (it was the only double decker on the route). then it went to having on of the few healthy fuel cell buses. looked great - lots of steam coming out of it, very quiet and a smooth ride. now they are bendy buses - like to single deckers stuck together in the middle with a concertinaed middle to allow it to turn corners. but the driver no longer takes your money and you have to get your tickets before boarding, and just how often are the ticket machines working...... i reckon a lot of people just hop on and don't pay, i wonder if the route is losing money. the reason the driver no longer collects the money is so that the bus can travel faster along its route as there is less delay for the driver trying to get change etc. it's a nice theory in practice the route seems even slower as the drivers just seem to hang around the stops.  blimey next i will be talking about how the price of mars bars have gone up since i was a kid.  who remembers aztec bars. scrummy.

      there are things i know are bad for me and doughnuts fall into that category. i am not a slender person - oh alright i am fat, i suppose i am technically obese but i luckily do not look like the staypuff marshmellow man,  i just look cuddly. anyway i am sitting at my desk listening to air america radio (via the internet) and along with the coffee i am drinking the doughnuts are being scoffed. they are custard filled and they are lovely. what makes them taste even better is that i know they are bad for me!

      so why am i doing this ? who knows. i know for a fact i live a dull and uninteresting life that would bore to tears most sane and normal people. so perhaps this is a form of revenge on those of you who have interesting lives.  the olympics are on at the moment and probably for the first time in a looooong while i am not interested. its not because i know that the coverage is going to centre on the fact that the great british team are not going to win medals (we never do and besides the point is to take part...) its because its on during normal hours, which means the majority of it takes place while i am at work. there is something special about staying up late at night to watch sir steve redgrave win his 5th gold, there is nothing interesting in it during the day. and that reason alone is enough not to want the olympics coming to london. there are other reasons why i don't want them coming to london, but that one will do for now.  gotta feel sorry for the phelps guy, by expecting him to win 8 golds anything less than that and he's a failure. but just by being one of the best at what he does he should be receiving the plaudits of most of us. mind you don't feel that sorry for the USA dream team - was good to see they lost to puerto rico (this is not a political statement (there will be plenty of those to come at some point) just i don't feel the olympics are a place for highly paid sports stars to be at).  right end of my first real post. and i still haven't answered the question of why? i can tell you the answer isn't 42.
