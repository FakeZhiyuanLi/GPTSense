      I went to see Jeanesse who needed someone to take care of her yesterday night... We went to watch  urlLink Garden State  at the movie theater...  She was almost sleeping at the end... She told me she wasnt sure if the movie was good or not, it seems without any storyline to her...  I actually loved it!  This movie is about Large a man who returns home after 9 years being away... He never had the courage to open his heart to the joy and pain of the infinite abyss that is life until she met Sam(the lovely and beautiful  urlLink Natalie Portman ).  I think I havent found the right person yet...

       urlLink Sports - World record for Michael Phelps at swimming : "ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Michael Phelps is done for the Olympics. Shortly after winning his fifth gold medal and seventh overall, Phelps told U.S. men's coach Eddie Reese that he wanted to give up his spot on the butterfly leg of the 400-meter medley relay team to Ian Crocker."   This guy is my hero and inspiration!  He is 19 years old, and he just became the world best swimmer in human history. By achieving this, he became millionnaire, famous and also became an example and hero for thousands of young athletes across the Country. He also has an incredible heart, by giving away his spot to Ian Crocker even if he was the one who qualified during the qualification.  It's incredible how you can achieve things when you put your mind into it. When you stop worrying about the outcome of your actions... Most of the people dont do a thing because they are afraid to do it, because they are scared to have pain or pleasure(Tony Robbins).  Even tough everyone said he wouldnt be able to do it, a lot of newspapers said he wouldnt do it, he did it. He just didnt care what people had to say!  Go take a look at his interviews here :  urlLink Jay Leno's Tonight Show  Watch the Visa ads with Michael Phelps afterwards!!! it's incredible!!!

      I decided to start my first Blog...  It's been a while I'm thinking about it, saying I will do it soon... and was never starting it...  It's weird how things are sometimes, I stopped looking around to find a place to write my free blog... and today I decided to install googletoolbar, to stop receiving popups. Ken told me the google toolbar would block everything, it did!  I wondered in the options and found something about a blog... here I am now!
