      Nice morning, blue sky, green leafs are shivering by breezy wind. With a cup green tea my grand pa is heading towards balcony. As usual he set on his cozy chair. Cleaning his glasses he took his favourite newspaper on his right-hand palm. After reading some of the headlines in naked eyes he put his glasses on. Now he is in the deep sea of his favourite columns.  I am getting ready for work. My dress-up almost done, suddenly Dada called me with screaming voice. I left everything aside and ran to Dada. “What happened? Why are you screaming at me? Is anything wrong?” I replied him with a slowly downing my voice.Although he is 85 years old he is commander-in-chief in our joint family. Everybody carries his order, advice and request without saying a word.

      Hello how is you? What are you doing here? I am here to help you guys. The best thing you can do in here is read books and sleep, isn’t it? What else can I do here, me alone? I want to do my assigned task but I always feel lonely and tired of using Windows me. So I must change Windows me to another Windows or any Open source OS. The best OS I prefer is lynx. But that’s really confusing for other people who are familiar with Windows based system. So I must choose Windows of another version. Probably I shall choose Windows 98 that I like most among all other Windows. Windows 98 is the best way of doing something simple.  Now I've decided to write a Novel. Just to spend my lazy days. here is my first project ...called 'Choloman Bikol' which means 'Moving Junk'. Comments and suggestions are always welcome. Come back soon...
