      On a most interesting flight home from Florida, I met a guy who loves candy. Yeah, yeah, you say, who cares about a guy who loves candy? Everybody loves candy. No, that’s not true. Everybody does not love candy the way that I love candy. I’m a grown ass woman, and I met a grown ass man that truly loves candy so I’m amazed right now. Let me give you some background.  My dad used to bring my sister Hershey’s candy bars home from work. Shay was a ritualistic candy bar eater. There was a way the wrapper was removed. There was a way the uneaten portion of the candy bar was re-wrapped and so on and so forth. Somehow, I remember very minute, but vivid details of my childhood.   I even remember specific details about stuffed animals named Bumbles with only three plastic whiskers left, shirts with fuzzy cats on the chest, red foam sandals, Felix the Cat gum, our housekeeper Maria from the Philippines. Every day there was a variation of, “Do yours hurt too?” She’d put my hair and shay's hair in identical buns or braids or pigtails. But she did it so tight so she wouldn’t have to deal with them later. At the end of the day, I’d rub the sore spot on my head where the ponytail holders clung for dear life on my scalp. But my detailed memories might be because I had a very specific attachment to certain things, and as a little girl I treated my personal belongings with utmost care and love, as if they were alive. God, now that I think of it, maybe I had or even still have a tiny bit of OCD. Hallucinations? Maybe I was imaginative.   Anyway, the candy. The candy. All Shay's teeth rotted out to the point where a high school friend once asked, “How’d your sister get braces so early?” when he looked at her kindergarten picture that hung in the hallway. I said, “They’re not braces. Her teeth were rotten.” And I don’t pin that on bad parenting. William and Ann are the bomb parents, for sure. It’s just that she was the baby and was spoiled to all hell and at an early age figured out how to take full advantage of having tow American parents that worked outside the home and one totally non-American nanny  that was beaming down at her every second she got. She probably didn’t do much brushing even when supervised either. You know what else? The water might not have been great. Or maybe she had an iron deficiency. I don't know. Doesn't matter. The rotten teeth fell out and huge brand new, healthy ones came in. I think all of us suffered the HUGE new teeth thing. I had HUGE new teeth with HUGE lips so I was straight traumatized. At 18, I finally felt like everything was somehow falling into alignment. As a result of that chapter of Shay's Rotten Teeth, my dad didn’t bring me or my brothers home much candy but at the grocery store if we were really lucky we’d each get our own box of Fruit Bars (pineapple orange was my favorite) or Fruit Roll-ups (strawberry with the seeds). The box was to last us a week. Mine always lasted a day, and nobody would share with me. “Lauralee, you have to pace yourself. That’s just gross…” my sister would say. Of course, the trio of siblings who were still living at home had a pact to never tell on the other if we did, in fact, eat the whole box in a day. I couldn't be accountable for my sweet tooth at such a tender age. I didn’t even know our phone number by heart. Cut me some slack.   I needed more candy. I loved the packaging. I loved the look of a well-stocked candy aisle. I loved having it, each brightly colored item, just as much as eating it. So at 15, I got a job. I spent probably 20% of my income on candy. The rest – I put it away thinking by the time I was 16 I’d have enough for a car. No, the Jeep didn’t come until the following year and trust me, I thought I was a bad ass mother fucker with my own car. I’d even taunt my parents with it. Punished? What are you going to do? Take my car away? YOU CAN’T! I bought it myself. Then again, I also got away with murder because I made my mom believe things. I think I may have told her that it was customary for kids NOT to come home from prom just in case I had a great evening. I didn’t. But I needed that back-up plan.   In the winter of 2000, Danny and I used to eat candy in bed at college. Sometimes, grossly enough, it was before we actually went to sleep. I don’t think Danny normally eats tons of candy, but around me, he couldn’t help himself. Nobody cares about it, but I swear I bonded with him over that experience. It seems stupid, but it was communal and about sharing and about having nothing to do together.   Now, back to the flight back to VA with the guy I met. I had a pack of Starburst. Original, of course. I ate a red one, and I offered one to the guy next to me. Now, I must admit, I normally, if I can really handle the possibility of having to have small talk with this person, offer some candy. This is where all the judging by a book’s cover comes in to play, and I don’t even mean to do it. You know what I’m talking about. You have to ask yourself, “Will this person talk forever? Will this person be mean? Will this person talk about stalagmites or Republicans or germ warfare? Will this person put her shit in the middle seat thereby rendering it her space? That type of shit. I rarely actually talk at length to people on planes but it’s important to gauge who you’re working with for the next several hours. But with the offering of the Starburst, I was truly offering because a yellow was next. I hate yellows. Yellows kill me. If Starburst made a pack with just oranges and reds, the world would be a better place.   He took the yellow, and said thank you. “I always eat the yellow ones first,” he said as he maneuvered his back and legs and arms into the most optimal resting space in his chair following up with the straightening of his jeans and shirt.   I sat quietly, and had this internal dialogue. Gross. I hate yellows. Wait. He eats them in an order? He eats enough Starburst to actually eat them in an order? Do I eat mine in an order? No. I just eat the reds and oranges as I see them and leave the pinks and yellows for sheer desperation – or for Jessica and Amy. Is that selfish? They probably likes reds better too. Nobody actually likes yellows, do they? I’ll have to ask them. Am I a fat bastard for eating the whole pack? Why is he balling the paper up all precisely with two hands? Who are you, dude? Look at his shoes. Fuck. Can’t see them.  “Um, when you say order, do you mean you open the whole package and eat the yellows, then the reds and so on and so forth?” I asked after an entirely too long silence.   “No, I eat the oranges after the yellows actually,” he said. “And then I save the pinks and the reds for last and sometimes I mix them together.”   “Doesn’t it take forever to get to the ones you like then? I mean, yellow is always overpopulating the pack,” I said.  “It’s the same ratio in every pack. What do you mean?” he asked.  “No, man, I always have to deal with so many yellows. It’s like I pay full price for just a few pieces of candy. It’s terrible.”   “It’s the same amount per pack. What do you do with the yellows?” he asked.  “I hate them. That’s what I do with them. Maybe I’ll eat one. Maybe it’ll end up in my purse for three weeks. I’ll put them in the community candy dish. I pass them out to my friends after we’ve eaten or something. I throw them out. Whatever. Is it really the same amount per pack? This whole time I thought I just had bad luck and always got stuck with yellows. It’s that way with Skittles too. Skittles and the yellows. Jesus Christ.”   “Wow, and you can do that?” he asked.  “Do what?” I asked.  “Throw out the yellows,” he said almost incredulously.  “Yeah! Totally! And I hate the pinks too.”  “The pinks!? Oh, you’re sick in the head,” he laughed. “Pinks. Oh man, the pinks. They’re so good. How can you hate the pinks? What girl hates the pinks?”   I gave a “don’t be crazy” face after that comment, and he laughed.   I gave him all the yellows and all the pinks and asked, “Am I fucking up your system though?”   He said I wasn’t, but I was.  After another silence, he brought up the Skittles comment.  He agreed that Skittles had a high yellow ratio, and that it took patience to get to his favorites. With Skittles, he ate all the yellow, then the oranges. After orange, he moved on to the purples, sometimes mixing them with greens, but then green alone, then the reds. I asked him if he was this specific about anything else besides candy.  He said he only had this problem with candy. I found that interesting because I do eat only the reds and the oranges, but in no particular order. There’s no set agenda when I open the bag of candy. I don’t have to finish in one setting either. And then I thought, he calls the flavors by colors. I call most candy flavors by color actually. Soda too. Orange drink, anyone? I thought only I did this. How could I think that? I don’t know. It always sounds so childish to call it “a red”, but I don’t want to say cherry and what if it’s strawberry? And I’ve always called them by colors. My brain knows no other label.  “So you just eat a lot of candy?”   He said, almost in a bad guilty way, “I do. I never meet guys my age that do though so you know…”  I stopped myself from saying all of this out loud, but inside my heart was breaking for him. Dude, don’t feel bad! Candy is cool. Candy is a good mother fucking thing, man! Other grown folks just don’t talk about it. I mean, he is a grown ass man. But still. Why should that matter? He has a sweet tooth. Big deal.  “Do you like Twizzlers?”  “The strawberry ones, of course,” he said.  “Yeah. The cherry ones are the worst. You have to pay attention to the packaging when purchasing. I once bit into a banana Twinkie thinking it was the original and it ruined my entire day.”  “Do you like Swedish Fish?” he asked.  “Those gummy red fish? No. Gross. I hate those. I don’t eat orange wedges, those orange candies that look like large cartoon peanuts, no blue candies. I stick to the originals. Well, I do like Reese’s Sticks. I like Haribo gummy bears. Heide is good too. I like Japanese candy as well, but you don’t know anything about that. Don’t even bother with Three Musketeers. Gross. I do like Snickers, but only the tiny bite sized individually wrapped ones…”  “Twix?” he asked.  “Yes, but I don’t ever aspire to finish both of the bars. It gets gross. I’m not a hardcore caramel lover. I like the high-end grocery store chocolate. For splurging, I like Turtles, Riesen, and those other Riesens that are skinny and crunchy with toffee. I do like Werther’s Originals. Butter Rum Lifesavers.”  “Kit Kat? Gummy worms? Sour Patch Kids?”  “Oh yes. I love Sour Patch Kids…”   Cutting me off, “What about the watermelons?” he asked.  “No, just the original, and again no yellows, but also no greens. I don’t get into watermelon anything really. The only watermelon candy I liked were Airheads and Now and Laters, but I’ve retired those flavors. What brand gummy worms?”  “Just the ones at the store,” he responded.  “Eww, in those non-descript plastic bags with the red tabs? The ones that the Tootsie Rolls come in? Gross.”  “Yeah, those. I like those,” he said. “I’m not all high-end and shit, like you.” He was joking, I think. He did like most of the same candies, and actually knew what I was talking about.   I laughed and then he laughed so I think he was joking. Mother fucker, don’t be judging my candy selection. Wink. Wink. We talked about Texas, my record-holding high school wrestling team and other random stuff. I gently closed the conversation by pulling out my little Chuck Klosterman book, which I finished on the plane. Good short read.  Forging on…  I just thought of this! Now, did you like Tart n Tinys? Oh whatever happened to Tart n Tinys? The box, the tiny little pellets, the cute font. Who decides what gets discontinued? The Man is always trying to mess with me. Be it airport security or that disgusting banana Twinkie, it’s always something. Yes girl! The Man tried to take away my signature gold sparkly tweezers in Yakima. I had my stank lady voice on standby. I planned on saying, "Well, do you have $18 to replace them? Or would you like to hold the plane up so that I can mail them to myself? I will poke your mother fucking eye out, you rat bastard. Now please, put the tweezers down..." He sensed there was danger, and he gently placed them back in my make-up bag. "All set here miss," he said with a fake smile. "As you were sir," I mumbled after I was already PAST security. I am forever talking shit.   Wow! It’s probably totally unimportant to the rest of the universe, but that shit was fascinating. I’ve met some people that like candy, but not like this. As a matter of fact, after the first year of my friendship with Jess, we got into this random conversation about Runts. Banana Runts to be exact. She used to get Runts from her auntie and she’d share them with her cousin Jasmine. She and Jasmine hated the banana Runts so they just went to waste or were the cause of a good little girl fight in the backseat of the family car. I discovered that maybe, just maybe Jess was brought into my life specifically because I loved the banana Runt and now, a box of Runts could be enjoyed proper-like between us.   I swear, people are brought into your life for a reason.

So quicky we reached our limit and next thing ya know we are on to drinking screwdrivers... we all had 2 so Amy decided halfway through her second screwdriver that she was going to have another and since the waitress had ceased coming to our table she went to the bar when she saw an opening... it was at this point the nite started to fall apart.. the girl CUT AMY OFF!!!!!!! I am still laughing about Amy's face when she was told this... So Amy tells the girl..look I'm NOT FUCKED UP..I can handle mine..before she walked back to the table...so she rejoins us and was about to finish what she had left of her drink..while she pouted..the girl shows up in less than 30 seconds at our table and announces that AMY MUST NOW LEAVE....at which point I lost it...I couldn't help it.. out of all at that table AMY was the one who was more sober and the only one who didn't drive up there...Amy said WHAT!??!?! that's alright...and we just got up to leave she and I...  So we left and went to the store just down the block...where she purchased some smokes...and at that time a friend of mine matt pulled in...said he saw me leave...and I told him what happened so he offered up some Jack...I had reached my ever loving limit..but amy readily accepted...she bought her some coke on ice and mixed it up RIGHT THERE IN THE PARKING LOT..we cruised around for a few...just laughing and stuff...when she spotted a friend of hers in a parking lot returning movies @ 1AM...needless to say...I didn't take her home...lmao..  So Friday nite.. she calls me up @ 6...tells me that her friend Brad called and sent out an invite to a Hustler Party up in NYC... where he lives...and did I wanna go...So I was like sure.. So she and made plans and decided we needed to celebrate our good fortune at getting the invite...and went out to The Hill... it pretty much was to tame for us so we ended up in CLUCKS..and for the first time in my 24 YEARS i entered a WET t-shirt contest...she and I took first place....woohoo...we got back to my house @ 8AM..and we had to be on our flight @ Noon...so we hurried about and got to the airport @ 10:40am... ended up they asked if we wanted on the 11:30 Flight to NY and we took it...

      I'm at work and not a lot of time to gather my thoughts on this... so here's a quick post on this subject..and i will add more later.. you better believe it...  Can men and women be friends without the sex thing getting in the way?      MEN: Can men and women be friends without the sex thing getting in the way? Total Votes for this Question: 6175  So far, 59% have voted for Yes So far, 25% have voted for No So far, 16% have voted for Only if they lie to themselves    WOMEN: Can men and women be friends without the sex thing getting in the way? Total Votes for this Question: 3866  So far, 65% have voted for Yes So far, 22% have voted for No So far, 13% have voted for Only if they lie to themselves   The following is taken from ONLY THE BEST movie ever.. The Classic..when Harry met Sally.. in which they have a discussion on the matter at hand..  Harry: What? Can't a man say a woman is attractive without it being a come-on? All right, all right. Let's just say, just for the sake of argument, that it was a come-on. What do you want me to do about it? I take it back, OK? I take it back. Sally: You can't take it back. Harry: Why not? Sally: Because it's already out there. Harry: Oh jeez. What are we supposed to do? Call the cops? It's already out there! Sally: Just let it lie, OK? Harry: Great! Let it lie. That's my policy. (They get into the car.) That's what I always say. Let it lie. Want to spend the night in a motel? (She glares at him.) You see what I did? I didn't let it lie. Sally: Harry - Harry: I said I would and I didn't...I went the other way...What? Sally: We are just going to be friends, OK? Harry: Great, friends. It's the best thing...You realize, of course, that we can never be friends. Sally: Why not? Harry: What I'm saying is - and this is not a come-on in any way, shape, or form - is that men and women can't be friends, because the sex part always gets in the way. Sally: That's not true. I have a number of men friends and there is no sex involved. Harry: No, you don't. Sally: Yes, I do. Harry: No, you don't. Sally: Yes, I do. Harry: You only think you do. Sally: You're saying I'm having sex with these men without my knowledge? Harry: No, what I'm saying is they all want to have sex with you. Sally: They do not. Harry: Do too. Sally: They do not. Harry: Do too. Sally: How do you know? Harry: Because no man can be friends with a woman that he finds attractive. He always wants to have sex with her. Sally: So you're saying that a man can be friends with a woman he finds unattractive. Harry: No, you pretty much want to nail them, too. Sally: What if they don't want to have sex with you? Harry: Doesn't matter, because the sex thing is already out there, so the friendship is ultimately doomed, and that is the end of the story. Sally: Well, I guess we're not gonna be friends, then. Harry: Guess not. Sally: That's too bad. You were the only person that I knew in New York.

      My procrastination comes in many forms. The latest avenue of fucking around was so intense, I couldn’t go it alone. I had to drag an innocent bystander in and force him to co-sign. Actually, there was no force involved. He willingly agreed which makes me think he too is insane. I was browsing around the Internet looking for the lyrics to that R. Kelly song Homie Lover Friend. Why, you ask. It’s all a part of the procrastination process. We may never know why. In doing that, I was brought to a link for www.writeaprisoner.com. I was having a very emotional day, a day where I felt like I needed to change the world. Oprah was on in the background and she has a power over me.   Wait, let me back up a second. I also found the lyrics for that song Salt Shaker by The Yin Yang Twins. It was on in the car one night during a drunken trip through the hills of good ole VIRGINIA ... (don’t worry, we had a designated driver at the wheel). We were on our way to the proverbial after-party and I swear I heard him say, “Make your p****y fart for The Yin Yang Twins…” Not wanting to be less than a lady, because that’s way easier to fuck up if you’ve had two and a half cranberry vodkas, I mentally jotted those words down in my head so that I can research later rather than ask aloud if I just heard that. Sure enough, that’s so what he said. Disgusting. And hilarious, but never ladylike. Ladies, don’t ever queef just because some rapper told you to. I mean, is he going to write you a check? Doubt it.   Now, so I was in this good humanitarian space when I decided to browse through the prisoner pen pal website. I thought to myself, Wouldn’t it be amazing to change the quality of one’s life through the lost art form of letter-writing? I could single-handedly brighten someone’s entire cell with a one-page letter about life on the outside. I could talk about anything or nothing at all. He could write me back and we could start a friendship. Then the needle skipped all the way across the record, the piano closed up all stank and loud and I realized that I didn’t want to get myself into a potentially dangerous situation. I said get MYSELF into this situation. So, I called on Spriteboy who can also be labeled my Homie Lover Friend. I mean, he doesn’t get down with the ladies, but he’s still my homie. Sprite was sitting on IM, and I know his ass wasn’t doing anything productive. Maybe he was. But something inside me told me to send him the link and open that dialogue. I did, and we went off. You see, we IM’ed back and forth about the karmic peace we could bring to someone through our words. We were straight up writing haikus about how great our deed would be. We were making plans to get post office boxes, stamps, the whole thing. Then we started cruising through the bios and that, my friends, is when shit just started to go awry. Okaaaaaaaaaaaaay. I was looking for a lonely man, but all of them wanted more than friendship, more like “sensual lovers with full lips”. I don’t really want a lover. I just want a pen pal that’s happy to get mail. One dude grew his hair crazy long and quoted the bible, almost cryptically, so I had to press back real quick especially after I saw his rap sheet. He was killing fools. I just want to correspond with a non-violent person serving excessive time for drug possession or something. I mean, Whitney Houston and Rush Limbaugh are in possession, probably right now, but we wouldn’t know for sure with Whitney because only her “mother is privy to that information.” They’re so not in jail. This one dude nearly bragged about selling 180,000 hits of ecstacy and then detailed how all the people in his crew were “rats” but that he held strong and didn’t “rat” and now he’s in prison hoping to find a good-looking lady of any race, but she can’t be big.  Now Sprite’s ass knew that to be a good person, he should just pick a dude randomly but he was steady looking at pictures. He sent me a link to a fine ass prisoner. A fine ass prisoner and I said to myself, We must stop the madness right now. What are we doing? Sprite noticed that the fine ass prisoner wasn’t getting out until 2033 anyway, so he didn’t need to get his hopes up. He said that fool “went in looking like Danny Roberts but will come out looking like Sean Connery…” In that moment, we simultaneously decided that we needed to write older lady prisoners. I thought it might be interesting to get an old lady killer, but instead I picked a lady who’s locked up for selling hella weed. I don’t think that’s fair at all. Selling weed? Locked up for four years? She’s getting out soon though. Bless her heart. Sprite picked a lady who’s good at “guitar pickin” and once was a rancher and a cheerleader but also a murderer. She’s a pretty lady, and she asked us nicely, very poetically actually, not to judge her until we know the full story. I don’t know if that’s his final choice though. But you can see how a project like this could go awry. I mean, it’s born out of kindness though.  I don’t necessarily want to demonize all the people that are locked up. Sure they’ve made mistakes but that doesn’t mean they’re diabolical insanos. Well, I did just watch Red Dragon and that shit fucked me up. I had to pack an overnight bag and go right on over to my friend’s house. I hate when Coral’s gone. She won’t even watch a scary movie though. She’s all kinds of scary about that shit. Red Dragon though? How you gonna put glass in people’s eyes? So yeah, picking a pot-selling lady with pretty hair was the best route.   Sprite picked a killer. That fool is brave. Procrastination is about to cost him his life. Umhmmm. (Ooooooooooooh, it ain’t my fault. Did I do that?)

      Well, once again, it was time to become sleek, smooth, and clean-feeling by getting the ever-so-popular Brazilian wax. I've never looked forward to the appointment. I look forward to it being over, to walking out of the skin care salon feeling slippery and youthful. That makes the brief, yet excruciating experience of having your hair ripped from the very sensitive genitalia by boiling hot wax worth it, if you can believe it.  "Dere arrre verry rrrung ways of doing da wax," Mary once told me, the kind Russian woman of a sophisticated little salon on Perry St. in Greenwich Village, New York, who was also the first to take on my regular pubic de-fuzzing. She explained that "de hairrrs" grow in all different directions, and it would "be bad" to pull it out the wrong way. "Be bad"? Is this equivalent to Dr. Egon Spengler's idea of it "being bad" to cross the streams? I'm just curious because this is the only part of my body that qualifies me as a woman and not a man. So, Mary explains the science of hair removal. I try as hard as I can to not scream and cry, but there are few words to describe the fear you experience when you put your vagina in the hands of a strange Russian woman. (Hmmm…sounds a little unlike I intended it to).  A lot goes into this process, and I wonder how slightly overweight and inflexible women do in this situation because there is a lot of participation going on here. You don't just lie there with your eyes squeezed shut, praying for the experience to be over. Think about that area, lots of folds and crevices to get into. How do you think one gets in there? Well, I'll tell ya, it involves a bit of spreading, a lot of lifting your legs up and over your head like you're in the goddamn Cirque de Solei. If you've never been waxed, then you wouldn't believe the sight of this. And why do we do this to ourselves? No, it's not because pubic hair is unruly or dirty. I'm sure there is a societal influence, but it really does feel very nice.   Sadly, New York is a bit far to travel for a wax, so I was forced to look for a new lady and a new salon in the greater Virginia area  . Maybe because of my comfort with Mary, I refuse to be waxed by anyone who does not have some sort of Eastern European accent. Stereotyping? Absolutely. I admit it and I don't care. If you're insulted, well then pout your damn face off, I trust the people from the countries who know about skin care more than Americans. I went to one American chick once in Boston. She had an accent of Southie. Her hair was frosted, her face was broken out and caked with bad foundation. Skin care, people. This is where we are. If her face looks like that, is that what my crotch is going to look like in two days? Well, she was afraid of the Brazilian. She heats up the wax while telling me the story of how at beauty school, no one wanted to practice the Brazilian and no one would volunteer to be practiced on, she hadn't done it that much. Oh good.  "Is that good?" "Is there hair there?"  "Yeah,"  "Well…then…can you get it?"  rip  "You wan' it closa?" she asks.  "Well, is…there…still hair there?"  "Yeah,"  "Well…then can you get it?"  No success, I'm sad to say. It became too awkward as I tried to explain that she needed to really reach in there so that there was NO HAIR, so I reluctantly agreed that it was fine after the third or fourth attempt to get her to give me a Brazilian wax, since THAT'S WHAT I WAS PAYING FOR. So, Eastern Euros it is. If I can pronounce your name easily, then you're not coming near me with that hot wax.   So, today I wandered into a Skin Care place in San Diego   The place seemed nice enough. There was track lightening and the walls were a warm beige. There were fake plants and flowers strategically placed and a magazine rack filled neatly with various Vogues, Glamours, and Cosmopolitans. Classical music was playing. The young, fresh-faced receptionist welcomed me and asked for my name. I attempted small talk and said, "God, it is so relaxing in here." She gave a half-smile, one of those, I-don't- want-to-talk-at-all, but-I-have-to-smile-because-it's-a-requirement-for-my-job type of smiles. She looked at me oddly and said, "Your appointment is for 4:15." I looked at her clock which read 4:08. No one was in the room but the two of us. "Okay, well…I guess I was early…. I'll just sit down then."   Madga, my  waxer of the day , comes into the room. Madga, good name for waxing. She has a gold tooth, and I don't have any idea how to take it. I ignore the odd choice by Magda to have said gold tooth and move into the waxing room - a cold, sterile room with fluorescent lighting (ridiculously unlike the comforting and deceiving glow of the waiting room), where I proceed to take off my pants and underwear. I have to lie down on this long table with that paper on it, like at the doctors office, waiting quite uncomfortably half nude (important half revealed) for her to return and the medieval torture to begin. She enters holding a pot of brown hot wax. I'm used to green. It's not plugged into anything, and there is no stand to set it on, so she places it between my legs, which I have to say, made me feel a bit uncomfortable. I'm sorry, I mean more uncomfortable since I'm already in a room that looks more appropriate for embalming, and my p*ssy is hanging open for a gold-toothed freak to rip it apart with her shit-colored wax.   To put it clearly and briefly - it really hurt. She used a different tactic altogether than the others have. Most lay down the wax and use this special paper to rub onto the wax, then rip it off. This woman used this thick wax that would dry quickly, then the wax itself would serve as the paper, and she would rip that off instead. Horribly painful the first time all the hair comes off, but when she goes over it again to claim the stubborn strays, it doesn't hurt at all. She just peals and rolls it off, and it doesn't even sting. Problem with her style is that she doesn't actually have me do the whole spreading thing, and she doesn't confine the wax to just placing it on the part where the hair is. She covers the ENTIRE AREA with wax lines. Meaning, she doesn't put the wax beside the… "functional pieces", but lies it right on top. Women, have you ever had burning hot wax placed directly on your…Pleasure Button? Well, I could have cried. The woman had to blow on it (from a respectful distance, thank God) to cool it down because burning my Happy Flab is NOT fun for a normal, non-masochist. It was over quickly, but don't for one second think I didn't consider the fact that she might tear the whole thing off.   So, I left very pleased with the results. Unfortunately, like most waxers, she left one little section, an area higher up than they go - above the asshole. A kind waxer named Kler who was my regular in DC before she moved to Florida completely understood this problem. She said, "Most peeepul do not get dis area, and vat arrre you sooposed to say? 'Wax my asshole, please?'" True, so true. So, you hope they'll get it, and if not, it's a shame. Kler wisely pointed out, "If you have a boyfriend, and he iz down zare - he vill see oll dat heyair dere!" Socrates, this waxer.   However, smooth and slippery I am again, armed with my loofa and Tend Skin to avoid the painful tragedy of regrowth. I'll be back in a month for this lovely adventure to begin all over again. I guess I don't know how to explain it, but you'll have to trust me - it really is worth it.

      I've been feeling...connected. It's a strange way of putting it. You know when you feel disconnected - separate from everything? Well, have you ever felt a part of everything? Like in Powder - you just start to wonder about life, about purpose, and though you can't think of a single word to describe it or explain it, it's like you just understand everything. I needed something to nourish that feeling so that I could pump out some wisdom if there's any in there to find, so I put on Contact. I know I've talked about it before, and I believe I wrote three papers on it in college for various subjects from Intro to Christian Theology to God & Science. Well, I'm going to talk about it again because the movies Contact and Powder mean the world to me for the very same reasons. Contact is not about aliens. Powder is not about an albino kid. It's about the merging of faith and science, something we have always believed were opposing forces. A long time ago, me and William, this guy who was my best friend in the world for two years before he disappeared into his philosophy books with his girlfriend, we used to have long talks into the night about the universe, about math and religion and where they intersect. We talked about how strange it is that we study all these subjects separately - language, math, science, religion, art - when they are all related to each other. And if you think about it, it seems so logical. So obvious. The relationship between math and language is taught clearly in the movie "Pi" (the symbol. I don't know where the symbol is on my computer.) This is just our intellect we're talking about here. We put that aside and we're dealing with the enormous dimension of the emotional world. This goes above and beyond anything else. However, the emotional world is linked so entirely to the mathematical and scientific world that sometimes it feels nearly impossible to narrow all that exists down to one clear understanding. It's a cycle. You cannot comprehend one without the other, so where do you begin? It's about energy, its meaning, its translation into life. I know I'm not being very clear, but like I said, when you're thinking about everything at once and basing it off an emotion you don't know how to verbalize - you end up with this previous paragraph.   But if it all matches up so perfectly, if everything plays a part in everything else, if things all really do align each to make the existence of something else possible, if it is true that if this universe was created slightly differently, with a different pattern by the smallest amount of difference one could ever possibly measure - then none of this would have happened...if all this is true - then how can we believe that we do not have a purpose? And if we do indeed have a purpose, this purpose cannot be just associated with our small societies, with our countries, with our planet alone. If each of us singly has a purpose, this purpose goes beyond even the lengths and depths of the universe as we know it and even farther than we imagined it. If all of creation exists in relation to all of creation, then we as individuals play an important role in all that ever was, ever is, and ever will be. Do I just sound crazy? I know this isn't well researched, and I know I have put in no effort for phrasing and editing. These thoughts are just streaming, and for some reason, they make perfect sense to me right now. They may not make sense to me tomorrow, and I'll return to having concerns about clothes, about my hair, and about the most minute, insignificant details that together form what is my life, but for right now, I feel very comforted. I don't think that means that I'll last forever. It may mean that I may have already fulfilled my purpose though I may never be made aware of it. It may mean that even if we do indeed have a purpose - we may not always achieve it, and that may not always be our fault. I don't know.   These thoughts are conflicting. In one respect, I believe in fate - I believe that everything is as it was meant to be, even when it feels like a mistake. On the other hand, I believe that we have control over what our fate is, or at least Fate lines some things up for us, but it's up to us to actually make it happen. I can't decide between the two because they both make so much sense. It's like in the Alchemist - the universe is constantly supplying us with signs so that we may discover and live out our destinies - our Personal Legend as I discussed in Driven. We forever have the option to just quit when our Personal Legend calls us forward. Maybe that's the beauty in our freedom - according to my studies , freedom is the one true gift from God. He knows everything, He sees our destiny, He leads us towards it, but it is up to us to fulfill it.   But going back to what I was saying about our roles in this huge universe. God, watching the beginning of Contact puts tears in my eyes. I barely need to watch the rest of the movie to feel the inspiration that one two-minute segment gives me. We're so small. I know that sounds so trite. Everyone says that, so we forget to really concentrate on it, but we are really really tiny. But we often say how small and insignificant we are, but my point is that even though we are so small, we are so significant. This universe, it's just enormous, and I believe 100% that there is more out there. I look at Ellie Arroway and think about how much enthusiasm she has, how she dedicates all her life, all her energy to science, to truth - but how it's even more sentimental than that. She searches to fill the gaps we can feel, not just see. She sees how small we are, how much space there is out there, and wonders who is out there, staring right back at us from millions of light years away, who is also feeling so alone, and wondering if there's anyway to reach out of where they are to connect with someone else, with us.  "See, in all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable is each other."

        Once upon a time  ,   there were two koalas. One lived far away in Australia, the other lived in the Land of Roses Zoo. They were indeed far apart and might have never met, but the Australian Koala and the Land of Roses Koala met one day at a Koala Bear Convention. After that day, they sent little notes on eucalyptus leaves to each other until they realized that they were completely in awe of one another to say the least.  The two koalas met up in various zoos around the world and were always so sad when they had to part. They had such a great time, making friends with the hamsters, the butterflies, the iguanas, the oysters, the caterpillars, the mice, and the turtles, all the other creatures of the world. Though they were so far apart, they knew that it was worth it. She could always climb her way to Australia. He could always run to the Land of Roses. They would gather in the palm trees eating clams and tomatoes, tossing beans, fighting together with the bees.   Then one day, the eucalyptus leaves grew thin and were no longer sent as much as they should have been. The koala who climbed did not climb enough, and the koala who ran felt like it was running alone. Land of Roses Koala curled into a ball and realized that it would give up all the trees in the world for the love of the Australian bear.   The Koala from the Land of Roses climbed up its tree and sang softly, hoping the wind would carry its tune to the Koala from down under. “Sleep, Sweetness, dream…,” it sang and sang, longing for the love of the Koala who ran, who cried, who felt like it was running alone.   But alone the Koala would never run because alone the Koala would never be. The Koala who was once surrounded by Roses, climbed its way to the ends of the earth to find the Koala who ran and ran to offer it every eucalyptus leaf that has ever grown. The Koalas joined together again. They threw a party for all the hamsters, the butterflies, the iguanas, the oysters, the caterpillars, the mice, and the turtles. They celebrated the union of the two Koalas, running and climbing together forever, never again forgetting the need to exchange eucalyptus leaves. They lived happily ever after.
