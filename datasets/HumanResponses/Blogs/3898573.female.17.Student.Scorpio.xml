      I am having trouble comprehending the feelings that I have right now.  I think that I like Jacob more than I ever thought I would when he first "asked me out" over a month ago.  I didn't think these feelings were capable from me at all.  All of my fears of commitment are gone.  Here is an excerpt of when I was talkin to my friend Sabina (who's in Japan right now...awesome :) )  (oh i was talkin about how i thought ashley liked him and stuff, so if there's a her or she mentioned, it's about her)  TweetaPopAruga (10:09:58 PM): oh god, let me tell u tho, my world of guys isn't all over with the soap operaness nowt hat i've decided on jacob...i think my best friend likes him TweetaPopAruga (10:10:14 PM): and she's all lyin to him, tryin to impress him and stuff TweetaPopAruga (10:10:27 PM): he was askin me if some of it was true yesterday, it's the dumbest thing lol TweetaPopAruga (10:10:42 PM): but she don't know he knwos she's lyin to him and he's just sittin there "u dumbass, stop it" lol xbebe0601x (10:11:19 PM): OMG wellllll xbebe0601x (10:11:24 PM): so now what? TweetaPopAruga (10:12:49 PM): so now all i can do is trust that he won't go for her if she tries anything (i don't trust that she wont..i wish i could say that she wouldn't but i know her better than that) but i think he knows that he has it good with me, i don't think he'll fuck it up xbebe0601x (10:13:26 PM): good TweetaPopAruga (10:13:32 PM): but they talk online a lot, cuz of ME...he wanted her sn to ask her questions about me and i gave in after lots of begging, and i figured they'd stop after he was done with his questions, but they keep talkin  xbebe0601x (10:13:54 PM): did you tell her you dont appreciate it? TweetaPopAruga (10:15:13 PM): well she won't just openly admit that she's doin it, but everybody knows she is, but she just won't tell me ( i guess hse's tryin to be a "good" friend) so hte only way i've really gotten to confront her without lookin like a bitch is by sort of jokin (with a serious undertone) about it and just lettin her know how much he means to me xbebe0601x (10:18:17 PM): dam do it TweetaPopAruga (10:18:32 PM): i'm so mad tho  TweetaPopAruga (10:18:33 PM): seriously TweetaPopAruga (10:19:24 PM): adn the thing that i hate is that if anytihng did happen between them, it'd be because he had this false vision of her from all the lies she tells him, she's one of those that molds herself to look like the person that who she's talkin to would be impressed with xbebe0601x (10:19:56 PM): wgat a butch she is TweetaPopAruga (10:20:05 PM): me and my other really close friend (we're kind of a little group right now, we all work togethre) but we were talkin about her and how she doesn't seem to even have her own identity anymore-she changes who she is with EVERYBODY TweetaPopAruga (10:20:11 PM): i dont' think she even knows anymore tho xbebe0601x (10:20:56 PM): sad TweetaPopAruga (10:21:18 PM): yep xbebe0601x (10:23:57 PM): sirry the computer sucks xbebe0601x (10:24:08 PM): so does the mouse xbebe0601x (10:24:19 PM): o on though TweetaPopAruga (10:24:44 PM): i'm tryin to figure out...o on? TweetaPopAruga (10:24:50 PM): ohhh go on? xbebe0601x (10:25:41 PM): yes xbebe0601x (10:26:04 PM): how is the birth control thing oigng? TweetaPopAruga (10:26:07 PM): i'm done talkin about that i guess, i talk about it too much and i feel mad and then i get this fear of losin him and i actually wanna cry...i think all my fears of commitment are gone...completely GONE, i think about this guy ALL the time, when i'm awake/when i'm asleep/when i eat, just ALL the time, it's kind of scary, but a good scary  Really the most important ones are my long things that I said..the part about crying...I've never really wanted to cry at the thought of losing anybody, not like this.  I just am so not ready to lose him yet and that thought scares the hell out of me.  I was talkin to Ashley about that and she just kept tellin me I had nothing to worry about.  She might be doin what that age old proverb or whatever says tho, keep ur friends close and ur enemies even closer.  Who knows tho, I mean, whatever happens happens.  I can't stress over it, all I can do is prepare myself for it.    I really can't stop thinkin about him tho, it's sort of drivin me crazy.  But in a REALLY REALLY good way.  This mornin I woke up at like 6:30 thinkin about him and it took like an hour to get back to sleep.  I just wanna see him all the time tho..THAT is scary.  I mean, I would love to see him a lot, but I dont' know what he would think about that.  I worry about that so much.  I don't want him to get tired of me or something.    OK, something other than Jacob to talk about...work is starting to suck more and more.  Today went by so SO SOOOOOOOOOOOOO slow.  Yeah, that's all I can say there lol.   Oh yeah, I signed up for classes at VWCC Monday, and I got all the ones that I wanted. :) yay!!  And I guess that's it for now.  Long entry again!  I guess that's what this is here for tho, just to get all my thoughts and worries out and be there for nosey people to read, altho I haven't gave anybody the website to get here.  If Jacob ever doubts how I feel about him, I should give him this address.  lol, he was asking for it last night but OF COURSE I told him he couldnt' have it.  Of course, with that wonderful spyware that I have no idea where it came from, who knows who knows what I write in here.  Oh well.  It's their own fault if they don't wanna know it.  And oh well if they tell anybody what's in here.  Not too much interesting I don't guess, depends on who u r.

      This is a good one, a lot of important stuff in it! :) the first was pretty much just a teenage ramble on thing about the guy she likes!  All day at work, Megan was askin what was wrong with me...there wasn't anything wrong exactly, my mind has just been constantly thinking about SO many different things, and I have a HUGE headache that I have had since what? Tuesday?  I don't know what I thought about really at any given moment today, there really are a lot of things that I could think about right now.  One thing, my older sister just got her own place (well, she's movin in with her boyfriend, but it's still HER place :)).  Tonight I got home from work, and it was about 11:00 so I was suprised there was nobody home...then I came inside and ALL of Angel's stuff is GONE! GONE! It's so freakin weird to step inside her room and talk cuz how much it echoes and her closet is empty, EVERYTHING that is hers....the stuff in the bathroom even is GONE.  It really makes me realize how quickly time is goin by and how that is my next step, now that college is gettin ready to start and all.  It just was a really big reality check for me tonight when I saw the emptiness that used to be filled with memories of her.    Oh, today was a really good day at work...I know this seems to switch topic, but I gotta say tonight was one of the nights that I love the MOST in my life....me and megan stayed after work until about 10:50 just talkin on top of my car.  We talked about so many things that need to be talked about that are goin on in each other's lives, what has went on in the past, and just stuff about close friends that annoy each of us...and we got to talk to the sweet man Eddie that lives in the appartments behind the theater.  Oh my god, this man is so cute.  He's probably about 45-50 years old and he's kinda slow in the head, but he has a great memory, he remembers our names...even mine! He remembers what we look like and everything, he's so cute tho.  I think what I like about him most is how he reminds me of everything that is still good and innocent in the world.  It's so nice to meet somebody like that after you realize how people are totally different than what you had once thought and once you just totally lose faith in some people, it's just so good to talk to a guy like Eddie and realize not to just hate and not trust the whole world cuz there is still some things out there that should be cherished and trusted.    Another thing cool about work today was talking to Chamonix.  It was kinda weird at first, because I had always talked and made sure she didn't hear me talking about Nelson and his history with her. But we talked about him and how we both recently found out (well, me, recently, her, about 3 years ago...) but we talked about how psycho he is and some of the things that he said about both of us to people that he knows would get back to us that he said...it's so weird. I don't really wanna get into all that too much tho, the stuff to tell there is just well, kind of not interesting just readin :). lol.  Ok, there is one more thing that I have noticed lately.  I think that Ashley is kind of gettin a crush on Jacob.  I know that sounds really paranoid, but like everyday she tells me how he is REALLY COOL...and if she'd said this once it'd be cool but EVERY day she says this.  And there's other things that she kind of does.  I notice sometimes when I talk about how much I like him and the stuff that we do it gets kind of weird.  But me and Megan talked about the things she does that really gets on our nerves.  My main two:  1.  She adapts to doing the same things that each person does that is their thing that makes them unique and does them herself.  This one really ticks me off cuz those things are what make other people them, not ashley ashley...she just picks up on them and uses them herself.  I've said something about a couple of the things she does of mine and she just says "girl i been doin this a long time" and it's like yeah, as long as i've been doin it. dumbass.  2.  She molds to be the person that everybody else would want her to be.  Not even always what they would want HER to be...but to be a person like the one that they would like.  Megan put it really good I think when she used these examples : with Neil, Ashley acted like she drinks all the time, and with RL, she acted like she is all kinds of sex-craved and masturbates all the time.  It's so annoying that she does that.    But I was thinking, and I don't think that anything is gonna happen with her and Jacob, but it's just that if it did it would make me so mad just because he wouldn't have done it for the actually ashley, it would have been with this person that he had a false vision of.  So if he did think he liked her, when he found out he just liked that false vision that was the front that she put up, it would be too late to fix anything.  But I really feel bad for any guy that actually really likes her.  I feel like I need to tell them to look past what she's showing them, look past it and see the real Ashley.  She is never gonna get a guy to hold interest if she doesn't let them get interested in the real her.  But imagine the poor guy that just believes that what she shows is the real her...and he falls for her just to realize that it wasn't her at all that he fell for.  That's gotta destroy somebody something bad.    I think I need to stop talkin bad about my friend...but there's one last thing I MUST mention when talkin about Ashley...she is the most damn selfish person I know.  She never likes to talk about anything unless it involves her or impacts her in some way.  Like you'll be talkin to her and then as soon as she realizes you aren't talkin about her, she'll go "uh huh...let me tell you what happened to me today" or "yesterday, or there was this guy that asked for my phone number.." or of course, the oh-so-famous "the guy takin the money at mcdonalds looked at me when he was takin my order...he liked me".  It is so annoying.  And when you talk to her online, you ask her questions and she doesn't answer them, just totally overlooks them to tell you about something goin on in her life or something that RL or Justin said to her.  You have to ask her like 5 times..did u answer my question? Answer my question! before she finally answers.    OK, so really, enough about Ashley! :) I really do love her, but there are just so many things that she does that just makes you not trust her in a way, I feel really bad sayin it, but it's so true.  I hate leavin on this note, makes me seem like such a bitch and like a bad friend, but again, this entry is turning into a book!

      So, this is all new for me.  I once tried to keep a diary when I was like 10...and I might have written in it once every two weeks or so. But..I'm gonna try to keep this one fairly updated since I spend so much time on the internet! :) we'll see how it all goes.  Ok, now for the "good stuff":  I really don't have anything interesting going on in my life right now, except for the fact that I am so overwhelmingly happy! :) Altho I do have to go down to Rockingham Community College tonight for a driving class so I hopefully don't lose my license after getting a speeding ticket for 81 in a 55...Life is really good right now.  I am sick right now tho, but it's just a sore body and headaches as of this moment...as soon as the Ibuprofen kicks in I should be cool.   All of my guy problems seem to have just went away, well, I still haven't told Derrick that I am no longer interested, but I think he is getting the point since I haven't talked to him barely at all this past week.  Altho last time I talked to him, I did find out that he actually got a job! At Applebee's, I doubt he'll keep it for long tho, it's gonna get in the way of his pot smoking and alcoholic-like drinking.    I am so glad that I decided that going back to Nelson would be a mistake because Jacob is so much better than him.  Jacob was over here yesterday and I realized how much I do like him, we have so much fun together.  I really hope I don't get him sick cuz he lives with his grandparents and all.  His grandma is still in the hospital.  Mom had to just tell him yesterday how worried I was the other day when he hadn't called me and stuff.  Oh god, mom talked to us a lot yesterday and didn't hold anything she wanted to say back...it would have been embarassing if it had been somebody besides Jacob that she was talkin to.  For some reason, it doesn't bother me when she talks to him. I don't know if that's a good thing or not.  Oh gosh, tho, some disturbing news: Yesterday me and Jacob found out that we are sort of related (and not too distant), but it's all by marriage, not blood.  Altho one of my cousins (I think second cousin) and his Aunt Rachel that is the marriage that links our families..are gettin ready to have a baby.  So we will share a cousin.  It will be his first cousin and my third cousin.  Hmm...that's kinda weird.  He acted so weird when he found out yesterday, all I could do was laugh.  It didn't bother me since it was just relation by marriage, but he was totally freakin out.  I couldn't help but laugh, I don't think he liked that all I did was laugh at it.  I didn't think he'd touch me again and he said when he did he was like "oh, damn it, I forgot". But we're cool now, he's ok with it cuz he had to talk to his good ol' Aunt Rachel and she said for him not to worry about it.  So he's totally cool with it.    Oh, some great news: Jamie and Red are broken up!!! :) :) :) :) :) YAY!!!! :) :) :) :) :) So now he's talkin to this other girl Sheri, but of right now, they're just friends.  We'll see how long that lasts ;)  Me and Jacob haven't put titles back on anything still.  I think he's scared of scarin me off or something. Cuz I don't think he's not doin it so that he can still mess around with other girls, I think I'm the only one that he's hangin out with.  I hope anyways.  I told him yesterday tho that I am totally OK with it, but I think he's still gonna wait a little bit longer.  When I talked to him about it last week, he just basically asked me, "well did it feel like we were more than friends in the hammock?" and I thought it did but I didn't really know what to say to it.  I think I lost that convo too. Damn it.  I so need to get him tested before anything happens between us but I really don't know how to bring that one up. I mean, how do you just come out and ask somebody to get tested?  Since I'm a virgin, I really don't need to get tested but I will if he wants me to just cuz he is.  I'll even pay for him to get tested, I just want him to be.    I'm gonna end this post now since it's turnin into a freakin book...Gotta get some stuff done before I head down to ol' North Carolina.

      So there isn't much to post right now.  I lost it to Jacob.  I guess that's worthy of writing about. And now, it's kind of different but not really.  Not as different as I thought it would be, so I think that means we really were ready.  He chose a party last weekend over me.  But he had been givin me all his Saturdays and hadn't partied with his friends much, so it's cool I guess. I already have him for next Saturday, we're goin to the Midnight Showing of The Goonies at The Grandin.  That'll be fun.  I just really don't feel like posting right now.  This is the shortest one that I have ever wrote.  Oh, there are a couple points I need to get out of my system.  Derrick called the other day and I wanted to answer it and talk to him.  And I've noticed that see, I used to think Jacob was just the greatest guy all the time, when I was with him and when I wasn't , but I noticed lately, I feel like that when I'm with him, but when I'm not, he's just ok.  I dont' understand it.  I think I just need to be reminded from him of how good a guy he is.  He's been sayin I'm "squishy" and stuff like that a lot lately, and I know he's kidding or whatever, but it's just hard to hear that and think he's a great guy all the time.  My feelings will probably go back to normal soon.  We'll see.

      I know how to feel now.  I am still slightly dissappointed, but I am not really mad at all. Maybe a little mad at Reece, but other than that, none at Jacob.  Last night when I was talkin to him on AIM, he all of a sudden was just like "oh, btw, sorry about the way I was acting the other night". He just up and apologized and I didnt' even have to bring it up or anything.  Awww! He's such a good guy, he really is.  He's comin with us bowling tonight.  Right now, it's a definite on me, Ashley, Shelly, RL, and Jacob.  Amy is a maybe and Megan is a maybe.  I hope Ashley invites Micheala too if she's workin.  I have to work again tonight, but we're goin to go at like 10 to Rock N Bowl.  It'll be cool.  Jacob doesn't know how bad I suck at bowling yet tho.  I'll be sure to warn him before we get there, I think I have to go pick him up.  He's supposed to call me while I'm at work (Mrs. B won't like that but I don't really care).  Well, I'm gonna get off here and exercise and shower and all that fun stuff.

      Ok, so first off, I went to court yesterday: got off on Improper Equipment since I went to that driving class. So it's not going on my driving record or goin against my insurance. yay! :) I finally got to start taking birth control last Saturday. So now I've gotten a week of my pills down.  7 of 28! yay! That is actually really good news.  I don't know how long I'll wait, it looks like it'll be thru a whole pack before anything happens right now.  But I requested that next Saturday I get first shift so maybe he'll be able to stay the night and we'll see what happens.    Now is the stuff that will not have a Yay! after it.  Me and Jacob went to Angel's to have supper Wednesday night.  All was goin so good-the food was good, conversation flowed, it was great.   Then me and Angel were doin the dishes and Reece wanted to go show Jacob the antique sewing machine he had bought for $10 in the building.  Well, I was ready to go and I went out there after they'd been out there maybe 10 minutes, maybe 15 at the most.  I go to the door-it's locked.  Ok, that's weird.  But after a minute or two, Jacob comes and opens the door.  I walk into the building and PHOOF, there's this overwhelming smell of weed.  I was so hoping that that was just the smell that was left over from maybe earlier, but I kept looking at their eyes and at how they were acting to see if they had been smoking up.  Well, their eyes weren't bloodshot or puffy or anything and they seemed to be acting fairly normal, so I was becoming more and more hopeful.  Then when we left, I noticed that Jacob smelled of it rather strongly and started noticing him acting SO different.  When we got back to my house, we were in my room laying in the bed and he goes "I gotta tell you a secret" and then he didn't want to cuz he said I would be mad.  So he wanted me to just guess.  Well, I told him I wasn't guessing, that he just needed to tell me.  So he finally told me that him and Reece "burned one".  I told him I already knew cuz I could smell it and all and then I told him that I didn't like him when he was high, that I liked him better when he was not high.  He took so much offense to that, like I had just insulted him so personally.  Apparently, he took it as me saying that I didn't like him as a person, but I was just saying that I didn't like the way he acted when he was high.  So he started acting so weird.  He told me that if he had turned it down, it would have been disrespectful because Reece was offering to share his weed with him.  Yes, I see that, but isn't it disrespectful to me at the same time to get high at my sisters house in the first place?  It's like he chose to be disrespectful to me over Reece and I would think that he would respect me more.  I mean, it's like he didn't even think of me when he did it.  Another thing that really bothers me is that I had asked him before, like a week or 2 before, to not do it in front of me, and altho he didn't actually smoke it in front of me, he had to be with me right after.  I did, however, get him to promise to not get high at my sister's house again.  I don't know where he stands on this issue now-I haven't talked to him since.  He didn't get online or anything last night.  I hope I get to talk to him tonight becuase I want to ask him to go bowling with us Saturday night after I get off work.  But when I dropped him off at Mark's the other night, I tried to do damage control. When we were at the house before we left, he said he didn't feel like he should hug me back if I didn't like him then.  But he did hug me and kiss me before he got out of the car at Mark's.  I don't know if I fixed it or not, but I tried.  I guess I'll find out when I talk to him again.    Anyway, I'm tired of thinking about this and all.  I think I'm gonna get off here and get the mail-hopefully my Rae Rae has sent me something back...we'll see.  If I could just get a letter from Adam that would be cool too, he's been gone about 3 weeks now and still hasn't wrote me damn it!!!!  I also wanna take a long ass shower.  I'll try to update sooner next time.
