      bad news. i've just been informed by my dear amoy street uncle that they're discontinuing my favourite brand of ciggies from next month onwards.  IM TOTALLY UPSET. apparently Superslims (by American Cigarette Company) is pulling out of spore cos they refused to submit to the grotesque ciggie cover revamp. i wonder if it'll make smokers quit tho cos from my viewpoint, it's simply gonna increase sales of ciggie cases only. unless they increase the darn prices again...NOW that did help me cut down.  back to the sweet uncle at amoy street. he rounds off the little cents on my ciggies. i was really touched when i he told me about the news and kept a carton specially for me. i know he prob just wanted to "get rid" of it but still...*sigh* the little things that people do to make me go mush.

      perhaps i should start with a summary lest no one understands what i'm gonna be bitching bout.  Xbox's my client and we get tons of people requesting the Xbox kiosk at their events blah blah. this particular one at event A majorly pissed me off. i'm full of sympathy for Guy A who's been our "middleman".  the liason officer for the carnival is one classic case of moronism at its best.   at 8pm on a friday nite, i took an hour kindly explaining the nitty grittys to mr XXX. fine. then XXX told Guy A the next day that i didn't tell him anything at all. note: XXX absorbs details at the speed of 15km/h.  next, this annoying dude wanted me to "recce" the entire carnival site on a sat noon of which HELLO its not our friggin prob as long as the kiosks are placed within the carnival itself.  then last nite, i received a call from poor Guy A at 1am in the mornin to tell me that mr XXX had decided not to get the kiosks cos he can't afford the transportation costs. AND then XXX  had the guts to kick up a fuss and demanded what's Guy A to do now that they have an empty booth??  me and Guy A are like HELLO. U DIDN'T WANT THE KIOSKS, SO U COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO FILL THE SPACE. DUHHHHHHH. what the @#$@ was that dude thinking??? *oh lordy*  If any of u noticed, i had kindly censored some portions in case u think i like being mean. but then again, i am a mean girl. *at times*

       i've left the conventional advertising industry 2 months ago and am beginning to miss the painful yet exciting world of advertising already.  advertising had been my savoir for the past 3 years and making this switch to go into PR and marketing just seemed kinda odd now. like i'm missing something. my craving for adrenalin rushes and the like have been bouncing in and out of my head for the past week. seeing massive openings at batey/ red cell didn't help much.  advertising isn't really as bad as what most people think. look! we get to brainstorm @ creative briefings, reviews, pitches, bitch bout ass hole art directors, pain -in- arse "pseudo" group account heads, annoying silly clients who write their own copy when they can't string proper sentences together, idiot suppliers who give you wrong colour seps on material submission days *god this one is HORROR*, idiot management who think clients still believe in confirming 25 insertions for the year or clients who want the world and think ad space's worth only $1.99 and creative FOC? where in the world are their fucking brains?  these stories may sound horrifying but i think i like this nightmare. cos knowing that you can survive it all and come through shining like paris hilton simply makes your day. especially when you're 60 and someone asks you what's your life been for the past decade?

       urlLink      me and dora @ Balaclava 23 July 2004.     missed her so much after her 5 week posting abroad. ever since our beloved Mun's departure at Centro, we started hanging out at Balaclava on Fri nites instead. which is a good thing cos it means we longer have hangovers on thurs mornings. that was shit hell... then again. maybe not... if we have team building on sat morns. we'll fry in hell for that moment of intoxication. but we'll get by it.     urlLink     terrance          one of the very few bohemians in this island of stuffy singaporean men (majority of them to be PC). or otherwise known as dora's cousin. he's an absolute joy to be with especially when we're on the same high after a couple of drinks. it's pure joy picking chicks up with dora and introducing them to terrance,  hell we just made his life much easier didn't we?     urlLink         chiawei  at Indochine after dinner. my super artist dancer mate whom i only see twice a year (she's studying dance in arhnem holland). we always spend hours and hours pouring our love lives to each other it's no wonder we always end up teary eyed each time we part. she's such a sweetheart, always bringing me little gifts from holland. woman, i love that rosebud salve you brought back this time round. as for the turquoise leggings, i'll need a little more guts to wear those out. i'm no longer the hippie i was 3 years back you know... *hugs*

      It's&nbsp;strange how&nbsp;single people&nbsp;are generally&nbsp;less anal if they found the "love of a good woman/ man". i witnessed&nbsp;an old acquaintance who had been glowing from ear to ear having been recently attached. Terrance then told me his friend's "happy quotient" went up from 4 to 8 after finding his significant other. The challenge is not about love itself&nbsp;but rather about finding a&nbsp;good or right person who would give you that thing called LOVE. It was heartening to hear&nbsp; and we were happy for him. The very same night, dora decided to find out about our own futures by bugging Jacky to read our palms.   I should&nbsp; never have relented cos what he told me was something&nbsp;which i've feared most. that i was destined to be single for the rest of my life. I know i should not believe in such airy fairy predictions on my future but to have the same prediction over the last 9 years by 4 different people is indeed freaking me out.&nbsp; And certain recent incidents had me pretty upset and angry at myself for being in&nbsp;a similar situation which i've sworn never to be in&nbsp;if i had the choice. and i&nbsp;HAD&nbsp;that choice. and i found myself crying during that night again.   kyle's parting words six years ago finally hit me. "You're too hard on yourself and your expectations of others. learn to let yourself go and someday you'll thank yourself for that." I never did quite understood what&nbsp;he meant&nbsp;but i think i do now. i've been pushing myself&nbsp;so very&nbsp;hard for the past 3 years and its toll&nbsp;had finally caught up. this insane need to prove myself to no one is driving me to up the wall. who am i proving and justifying myself to? me. because i cannot fail to...myself. i can now understand why Kyle left everything behind&nbsp;six years ago&nbsp;to pursue the life of a nomad. i was much younger then and could not forgive him for his seemingly selfish actions. but i do now. because it's totally fucked up&nbsp;staying here and knowing the constant would never change.&nbsp;

       urlLink    pish and celine. my life lines at murdoch. trish...i've never had the chance to really know her until we got to murdoch. she, celine, tam and me were the only unlucky ones stuck at the old flats on campus. but i've never regretted it cos it made us closer. trish and i bonded cos of the "mandy's muffin make new friends with americans only crusade". it was lonely for the first couple of weeks...we had no one else close to us so bitching bout the "american wannabe" was rather therapeutic. then celine came bk..and tam... it was heap loads of joy... esp in winter when we rotted in each others' rooms...pigged out on boston mudcakes (perhaps that's only me)... potluck at celine's flat...oh gosh...kwee chong the chef resident who made excellent curry..."eew sau" with the DISTINCT ozzie accent...the guy in trish's flat whose room smells foul...the 18 year old chick in my flat who smoked pot in her room and gave me free whiffs everyday.....the awful looking sporean girl with thick red lips and long hair that freaked us out by combing her hair in the balcony during late nights..gosh i forgot her name..she was "legendary"...lol  i digress. missed going to trish's place off campus where she's got this fucked up parking space up the slope..come on..my car's a junk...even putting it in first gear doesn't keep it stationery. i've yet to thank trish for her smashing pumpkins and the matrix cd which pulled me thru the entire afterword and cataloguing of appendixes for my thesis.  if there's anything i could have right now...it'll be to be right back in perth, stu v, flat 70, rm 1, smoking my reds and having that cuppa with my gd ole girl friends.

      According to pseudo feng shui master Mr Melvin Sim, his daughter is not allowed to carry or own a black umbrella as it signifies bad luck.  &nbsp; "I'm getting a black umbrella, the ugly umbrellas at home clashes with every outfit of mine." "You cannot carry or buy black umbrellas. It's bad luck." "What kind of bad luck?" "It's no good." "Why? Surely there's a reason?" "It's just no good." "BUT WHY?" "Even your grandma doesn't carry black umbrellas." "Since when has the&nbsp;color of umbrella Ah-ma carries got to do with me getting a black one?" "I'm telling you it's no good, its bad luck, its suay, so&nbsp;DO NOT&nbsp;bring one into the house." &nbsp; And hence, i'm not allowed to bring any black umbrellas home as long as i'm staying under his roof. But what totally pissed me off is his lack of reason in his superstitious belief and his denial that the logic is silly. &nbsp; I've always respected chinese history and its myriad form of&nbsp;superstitions. I avoid stepping on scattered ashes on the grounds because i believe they are offerings made from the deceased's family. So as a form of respect to the dead, i skip over the ashes. And i always try to remember saying "excuse me" when stepping into quiet places (entering hotel rooms) just in case there's a lingering spirit resting in there. But to tell me that i'm not allowed to carry black umbrellas&nbsp;just because its "suay", that i cannot comprehend.  &nbsp; Is it cos people at funerals carry black umbrellas to send the deceased off&nbsp;during rainy days? or does it mean lonely spirits like to seek "shelter" under black umbrellas?&nbsp;does that also mean we cannot wear black as it too signifies death and its solemn environment? *btw, my dad does not own a single piece of black clothing, accessory nor shoe.* &nbsp; Beliefs supported by logical explainations&nbsp;is ok. but blind beliefs just doesn't sit well with me. and i will argue till the cows come home for that (with the exception of this morning cos i refuse to start my Wed morn being foul). &nbsp; And so, Ms Sim shalt not carry a black umbrella into her Sim family&nbsp;home at Serangoon, Singapore.  &nbsp; &nbsp;

       urlLink    tony and&nbsp;me @ Chocolate & Alcohol gig&nbsp; urlLink     it was my first attempt at throwing a house party (dora volunteered weiguan's house for this). lesson learnt? keep the numbers at a minimum,&nbsp;house must always be air-conditioned and chocs and alcohol are terrible together. it just made all of us crave for the h20 by the end of the nite...the second house party at tam's was much better (minus the chick who puked on the lovely white sofa). should convince tam to do a xmas themed party this year. at least we can get ourselves drunk silly without burning&nbsp;a hole in our already&nbsp;shallow pockets.

       Was browsing around Sunny bookstore at Far East Plaza today (that's my fav bookstore where u can borrow and trade in your books if you don't like them anymore). guess what i picked up? TINTIN!!!   i've always been amazed at how the little joys can mean so much to me at the end of the day.    &nbsp;  perhaps i should pick up some Archies too next week? for some strange reason, i've always favoured veronica and my fav man is still reginald mantle. he's a pure arse but he isn't afraid of people saying that, is he? : )    &nbsp;  comics are great at destressing (for me that is). the japanese manga series of  slam dunk  and  psychometer  were awesome too. esp psychometer. it's bout this high school bad boy possessing extreme mental powers and works hand in hand with a stunning lady cop (young man older woman attraction of cos) in solving tokyo's hideous city crimes. excellent series... today's a rattling session...

       urlLink     dominic with pink hair 3 years ago.&nbsp;      dom and tony. we've known each other since we were 17. Chia wei and i &nbsp;like calling dominic&nbsp;"domdom". It sounds real silly i know. or when we're really in the mood to annoy each other, its "jiyeh". His fav line's "What thing what thing, tell me tell me". The only male bud besides Tony (below)&nbsp;who bothered replying my postcards in perth. Bless your souls.   urlLink     tony my vox pop buddy&nbsp;     And i still remembered the nite&nbsp;dom got drunk on one beer at pizza bellaroma in freo. Or the expression on his face (and deric's booming shouts) when bertram and i dashed across the road to zouk and almost got knocked over by a speeding car. He's an absolute treasure cos he's the friend who will never judge you and would instead draw diagrams and little stick pictures to explain his POV when your brain gets real dense at 2am in the mornin.    urlLink     dom in loo @ vultures in perth city. pic taken by tony.&nbsp;      He once told me and tony that money would make him very very happy. no disputes bout that. wait till my pr gets approved, then its your turn to enjoy melbourne as a freeloader till u become a millionaire. but u must make it a point to remember me when u hit the first mil and buy me the grand dinner u promised.  &nbsp;  i'm still trying to conjure a wish list to pass tony before he leaves on his 3 month sabbatical in 20 days time. He's the kooky bud who gave me things which no one else ever thought of giving:  - jap mags from taiwan army trips  - wooden carved figurines for xmas  - EVIROB Pink Bomb Shell for bday (apparently, it reminded him alot of me)  - Doll from vintage store in perth  - "e" by Matt Beaumont. Hey don't we all&nbsp;wish&nbsp;we worked at Miller Shanks too?  i always looked forward to swopping xmas gifts with tony. his presents always made me smile.

       urlLink    my foul tempered dad.Check his teeth out. They may be terribly aligned but hell, at the age of 51, they're pretty dynamite. Yes. He does most of the crab chores at the seafood meals.&nbsp; urlLink     k that wasn't why i wrote bout my dad.the objective was to bitch bout his manners on the road.  As usual, the ride to work today was totally nerve wrecking. He was driving at a deliberate speed as the car on his left who's been wanting to keep right for the longest time. Simply refuses to let the poor dude in. Why? Personal reasons, didn't like "the guy's face"????  His philosophy of driving as dictated below: One Do not give way to Mercedes drivers. they are snobbish and will never thank you for giving way. Two Do not give way to lorries and cabbies. cos they are reckless drivers??? and cos they've never given him way either i reckon. Three Do not give way to lady taitai drivers cos they're the worst of the lot (probably bought the license somewhere) and can't drive for nuts. Four Do not squeeze your way in front of his car without signalling. He will not hesitate to squeeze alongside with you until the sides are close enough for you to look at the driver and see his white hair (unless you're a lorry or old wreck). Five All bikers are a nuisance (cos they always appear in his blind spot when he needs to switch lanes, that i call it "suay") Five Always prepare your cash card for ERP entries etc. He will not hesitate to BLAST the horns till the security guards are roused from sleep.  That's my dad. The rude pig male driver.

       urlLink    long time friend celine who holds the record of my embarrassing chapters&nbsp; urlLink    Date: Friday 8 July  Time: Elevenish  Scene of unfortunate event: Wine Bar  Scenario: Bartender approaches Celine and me with lychee martinis.  "Sorry it's not ours, we've had enough for the night..." Belynda to bartender.  "This is from the guy lar."(points to a huge ah beng at a table next to us) - btw, can't remember his name. Next to me, I can hear Dean sniggering.  "Er, ok, thanks..." (celine and me to ah beng) Us girls then conveniently continued with our conversation with ah beng hovering behind.  15 min later after an uncomfortable "pretense", celine and i decided to DOWN the martini and thank ah beng again.  "Do you play 5 10?" (ah bengs asks me in a desperate attempt at conversation)  "i don't PLAY 5 10." (i wanted to roll my eyes, celine almost laughed)   "No lar, don't need you to drink, how about scissors, paper, stone. That one you know right?" (ah beng is indeed teetering on my already pissy mode)  "i do not play any games at any clubs AT ALL." (turned back to celine and rolled my eyes big time)  2 secs later Celine and I are on our way out. At the same time, i'm trying to convince Celine that this has NOT happened before.  30sec later. Celine and me ended up at Copthorne's lounge bar listening to some awful off-pitched female filipino singer (what a surprise they're usually really good) amidst old ang mors and indian men.   *sigh* just another episode for Celine to document under the files of "Hsin Yen's loser situation 1990-till date".

      I found this depressing article on CNN this morning.    A man named Bernard Heginbotham was aquitted for slitting the throat of his wife with a 12- month community rehab.  Aldous Huxley once said "What we love will kill us". A man was free to go because of his attempt at suicide (after the murder. The judge concluded that   "it was an act of desperation carried out in an effort to end her suffering while you were under intolerable pressure."   This made me sit up and wonder how I would've reacted if my husband of 67 years smothered me with a pillow with the intention of releasing me from further pain and discomfort. And would I thank him for this act of "kindness"? Or would I be disappointed in him for not fighting this battle with me?  Something to think about...

      I'm a huge fan of psychology test sites. Dubious in nature but I constantly find myself drawn to things that can apparently predict my future. A Death Test in particular.  The Spark.com  "I'm afraid we have some bad news. please, you might want to stay seated."  I'm expected to die on JANUARY 29, 2033 @ the age of 54 years old.  On that fateful day ,I'll most likely die from: Cancer 36% Alien abduction 13% Alcoholism 12% Homicide 6% Contagious Disease 5%  Apparently, the average life expectancy of test takers is 67 years old.  Back to my death cause. I've taken a closer look at the prediction and much as I hate to say, there's an element of truth in each prediction:  Cancer- Most probably from lung cancer  Alien abduction- I'm queen of paranoia but that's cos I suffer from OCD. If I'm out alone, I'll look over my shoulder every 5min to check for unexpected psycho predators.   Alcoholism- With only martinis and choyas consumed, the risk ain't that high.  Homicide- Shit. This I fear. I would hate to see myself being a victim in the film 7.  Contagious Disease- This I leave to fate. For a short period of my life (when Sep 11 came), i read every possible bioterrorism special report and was contemplating purchasing a gas mask through mail order. My buddy truly thought I was overly stressed at work and dismissed my fear as a moment of madness.  So I reckon 54's a grand age for someone like me.

Not paying for anything at all each time we hang out (Dora would know who this freeloader is) Six. Bad fashion sense (there's a thin line between attitude and sloppy shit) Seven. Telling me to step out of the car so you can take over the wheels for parallel parking (its MY car and I will drive and park anywhere i want even if its 15 min away from the destination. YOU WILL WALK WITH ME) Eight. Talking non stop (please. i get enough of talking at work so 2 min of silence every now and then is a blessing). Nine. Lie in my face (esp when its obvious everyone knows the TRUTH already) Ten. Not having enough guts to admit you've made a mistake (come on, homo sapien's fallible).

      List of things that piss the shit outta me on fri nights.   Why do we have to pay to get into crap clubs?   Why are we made to queue for hours when it's blatantly obvious there is enough space in the club?  Why do some women carry handbags to clubs and place them in the middle of the dancefloor while they dance? (Around their handbags… duh. This happened alot in metropolis, perth)  Why do people here dance in circles? WHY? (This really pisses me off! It's a frigging waste of good floor space)  Why must we pay thrice for Redbull?  Why do idiots dance with drinks in their hands only to fling the remains of their drink at those around them?  Why wear open-toed shoes when you know someone's going to stomp on it somehow? *GUILTY*  Why are there always pricks with BIG dance moves standing next to me?   Why is there always a queue at the ladies?  Why is there always NO FUCKING toilet paper in the ladies?

      2 June 2001, Saturday, 12.30am.  Is the pain here to stay? It’s excruciatingly hard and emotionally painful trying to let go of the past.  I’ve come to realise that one has to let go of the past by forgiving oneself first. It is only then that we can eventually move on with our respective lives.  Reading self-therapy books only helps in identifying the stage I’m in at this point in time. According to the book of  “still in love and not over it” symptoms, I’ve fulfilled enough to slap myself for residing in the last stages of break-up.  One:	Drinking too much (the bartenders know u on a first name basis and your favourite mixers.) Two:	Watching movies alone (amidst the stares of narrow minded singaporeans who think single people at theatres are psychos) Three: 	Lonely café days (writing the depressing thoughts in your journal) Four:	Checking the phone for messages in a compulsive mode (every 5 min, i could've sworn the mobile vibrated). Five:	Calling him to tell him how much I missed him (only once when I was really pissed) Six:	Still calling him out (on the pretext of "simple dinners"). Seven:	Pretending to message him wrongly on the pretext that he’d answer (superbly desperate attempt to hear his voice). Eight:	Clubbing excessively (losing yourself in the night) Nine:	Eating alone (cos you can't bear to talk to anyone). Ten:	Crying before I go to bed every night (and resulting in the oriental single eyelids). Eleven:	Not able to erase his number totally (which i've written down in an old phone book for old times sake).

      4 March 2002 on a melancholic Monday.  How strange. The man who had impressed me with his passion for advertising, then disappointed me with his materialistic motives, and now, once again, surprised me with his softer side. This man in subject is called Patrick. Patrick Lim.  My first interviewer, employer and now, a respected acquaintance.  A short man he is. Little thatch of hair grazing the top of his head. Trendy or should I say funky blue rimmed glasses. Expensive shirt. Zegna tie (always). Jaeger on the richer days. No- name sports watch on the poorer days. And the pair of immaculately polished black shoes. He is what I would call an “ad man”.  Funny how life turned out. Funny how people have so many different facets to them. I never thought much of him during my life at the agency. His money-oriented goals took the meaning of creativity and passion out of advertising. Then again, he is a self- made man. Growing up poor made him realize how harsh life is. How harsh people and friends are when you really need them.  Sweet of him to buy me a latte this afternoon.  The conversation was mellow yet sweet. Felt a tinge of pity and sadness for a man who built up his own agency at the tender age of 23 to see it falling slightly apart now. Or maybe not. Not too sure how bad things are beneath that entire surface.  I have always reserved respect for the self made man and woman. Strong and intelligent. Courageous and street smart. Every lesson learnt is not forgotten. They learn it through the hard way that is why. No daddy to bail you out when your business fails. No godmother to slip the extras under the table. No buddy to tell you what or what not to do. You live. And you learn.  Thank you for having that faith in me. For seeing me as a strong enough person who would succeed when left to step out on her own. Every young man or woman deserves to hear that. Because beneath all that determination and strength is just me. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you Mr. Lim.   Background music: All the good life by Tony Bennett

      11 August 2001, 7.40am.  The lost life GD93.  Lost my handphone last night. I never knew what it was like to depend on this little lifeline of technology that has grown so crucial in my life. For the first time in a long while have I felt this lost. I have not a clue as to how to deal with not being in contact with the world for the lost hours of last night until I get a new phone later.  I hate this dependency. On technology, on man, on whatever. It makes me feel like I’ve have lost a part of me. Like a man, a friend, a lover. He is the link in my life. He brings me to others and others to me. Losing him is just like losing my life. I miss my mobile, my cellular, my handphone, my life.   Technology sucks you in so deep you would not know what to do when it leaves you at a time it deems fit. My handphone thought so last night. Just when I thought of changing it to a much smaller and compact one, it seems to have understood my sentiments and silently left me.   He did not even say goodbye. I had so much love in him even if he was barely a year old. He took some time getting used to and now that I have lost him do I feel this sudden sadness and melancholy. I missed his cranky sms system, his lovely carousel music, his lightness. I only wish he found himself a better owner and that he or she would love him more than I did.

      what does being a superhero entail?  let me see. does she possess supernatural power to save the world perhaps? or maybe she's one of the servicing people who function as superhumans with perceived arm functions of an octupus? why does management not understand the process of execution in advertising? how can they think execution is something done once and forgotten (ala submit brief and do other things)? do they not know that an artwork is not forgotten until the insertion/ event is out? how can a person possibly handle 10 frigging projects at a go and be expected to put a smile on the client's faces for each and everything? what do some suppliers consume to possess highly retarded reactions to urgent work? how much shit can a superhero take before falling flat on her face?  it pains me to see things not moving when i've been so used to the efficent advertising environment. sitting at my desk for 4 fucking hours waiting for something that can be completed in half hours work makes me wanna cry.    cry because im so bloody frustrated with inefficiency. cry because it seems like i'm the only one trying to make things work. cry because small-minded people can't see the big picture (even when problems have been clearly highlighted). cry because work gets hampered due to not enough support. cry because at the end of the day, the client would see the superhero as an inefficient representative of the agency.    and pray tell what can superhero do?  sit and clench her fists cos there's no fucking point of pointing fingers after shit has hit the roof right?

      viagra and related sites?  i'm curious. do they have full time copywriters working on a brief to that? do they have creative directors doing up a concept before the copy's developed? half the time, the copy's full of grammatical errors and some of them are so totally funny and corny they made my fingers itch to click open the likely-to-be-virus-infected sex mail.  "let him run wild" "i feel great miracle" "you should see her smile" "never be embarrassed again" "old girls and very active" "look but don't touch" "she's happy now"  as you can tell, i get tons of spam mails cos i did the ultimate stupid thing of signing up for newletters at some psychology sites who probably sold my profile to the idiotic spamers. although i have to admit these silly headers do put a smile on my face when i'm upset *haha*

      swearwords:  n . word considered obscene or blasphemous.  when angry, count four. when very angry, swear - mark twain  strange. i've never hesitated to count till four before swearing. my first swear word was fuck and i was eight then. my mom chased me round the house with a cane and i didn't utter the word until my late teens. in fact, i never knew i was a swearer until my ex art directors imitated my identifiable form of swearing: FUCK. i cursed alot when i was a suit. advertising makes you short tempered. in fact, it made you nasty.  in the creative department i say fuck. in the media corner, i say "ta ma de". fortunately, i had very civil workmates in the production and studio departments (fairly unusual i should say). in the accounts deparment, i DO NOT swear at all cos i'm always late in submitting claims. so, i guess i'm bilingual after all. i can curse in malay too (of which i learnt from my previous account director who swore at EVERYTHING).  it was kinda hilarious looking back cos i'm pretty sure my tow kay GM would be mortified to discover this crude side of his sweet demure suits. but that's also cos he's never been subjected to the silly whims and fancies and worse yet, stupidity of certain clients. then again, i had a cool client who cursed more than i did. he says fuck more often than not but in a sociable way.  for instance fuck, what's wrong with your media planner? this is screwed up man...(and it was true so no complaints) fuck, your boss (GM) just called me. what the fuck does he want? tell him i'm not signing the 20 insertions for TODAY. no budget. (likewise how to complain when i totally agree with the client?)  fuck is the universal word for swearing. we've even created hand gestures in case we cannot hear the swearing. eg, when u're in the car and wanna curse the moron who almost scratched the paint off your sides. what do you do? give him the middle finger. or slam your fist into your palm. or if u're still ladylike in that situation, simply use a v- shaped peace gesture but flash it with the back of your hand facing the receiver. you can use the word or gesture any where in the world and still be understood (and punched in the face). isn't it simply amazing? Its global yet local.  i used to and still wonder about the person who first coined the word fuck. how did he or she create such a significant word that could release our daily frustrations and anger? how fascinating it would be coining swearwords as a career. maybe retired or jaded copywriters should experiment with that. i think they'll have plenty of unleased potential. till then, i'm mighty happy swearing fuck.

      i've done myself injustice by being lazy. as usual, i refused to troop over to amoy street market to buy good and cheap lunch and instead bought the next available "special of the day"item from a kopitiam opposite the road. guess what the special was?  mee rebus.  yes. the sticky gooey yellow noodles with oodles of fried onions and dozens of chives which i absolutely detest. the tedious removal of "toppings" made me dizzy already. i'm so ready for cheezels lunch tomorrow. or perhaps for dinner tonite.  i've not touched that yellow goo for at least 5 years. and here i am grandly pissing myself off by buying a lunch which i know i wouldn't touch.  the stupid things that i do.

      they've always said health is wealth. i never did gave that much thought until recently when my aunt's hospitalised. it's heartbreaking to see a strong lady broken down by ill health. i've tried avoiding going to the hospital for the longest time but i did twice the past weekend.  her constant doodles and writings of adjectives/ verbs etc on her little notepad disturbed me. i later heard from mom that the medication would cause memory deterioration. i've always admired her strength and determination and even today. i would have broken down far earlier than she did and probably contemplate suicide cos i know i could never get thru all that and still find the strength to smile.  i've never been able to deal with hospital stress. the smell, the patients, the white coats, the screams of pain and cries of grief. my greatest fear is not dying itself. but not being able to die. lying in bed disfigured and paralysed.  its most unfortunate euthanasia is not legalised in singapore. i would hate to lie in bed, not able to articulate or move yet hearing my loved ones comfort me . i would want to wake up and touch them and tell them not to worry and i'll be fine but will i be?  i saw a reality series on trauma recovery where this mexican girl was disfigured in a car accident (drunk driving by a stranger). her car was on fire and she suffered 60 to 70% burns. she wasn't expected to live but she did. her face had literally disappeared, melted under the extreme heat and her hands were reduced to stumps. it's horrifying and really heart wrenching watching her but she had so much, just so much courage and determination that i was in awe. she's currently undergoing facial reconstruction and i hope she makes it through. she had so much generousity that she even forgave the guy who knocked into her.  the wonder of some people in this world.

      was filing my previous writings and found an interesting list of quotes which i really liked.   THE NEW PLEDGE I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States Against Anything Un-American, and to the Republicans for which it stands, two nations, under Jesus, rich against poor, with curtailed liberty and justice for all* *Except blacks, homosexuals, women who want abortions, Communists, welfare queens, treehuggers, feminazis, illegal immigrants, children of illegal immigrants, and you if you don't watch your step -unknown  If you could live forever, would you and why? Answer: "I would not live forever, because we should not live forever, because if we were supposed to live forever, then we would live forever, but we cannot live forever, which is why I would not live forever," -Miss Alabama in the 1994 Miss USA contest. {Hullo, if you can't convince, confuse?}  "The paradox of our time in history is that we  spend more, but have less. we have  bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less  time. we have more degrees but less sense, more medicine, but less wellness. we drink too much, smoke too much,  laugh too  little, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.  we've learned how to make a living, but not a life. we've done larger things, but not better things. big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. these are the days of two incomes but more divorces fancier houses, but broken homes.  say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side. give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent. say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that  person will not be there again. Give time to love, give time to  speak and give time to share."  -George Carlin

       urlLink    haig park circle, east perth  was running a search on potential homes in melbourne and perth when i came across this beauty nestled on prime land, East Perth (also known for its yuppies). swan river and millpoint are other breathtaking areas where their apartments overlook the ally mcbealish city skylines and rivers. you can check her out in more detail at  urlLink http://www.aussiehome.com/property.asp?pid=40468 . she's worth a hefty AUD$769k , reasonably cost effective compared to Singapore's $700k where you buy a 4 room condo and curse yourself silly for fighting pool space on sat morns?  i've always wanted to live in manhattan or san francisco. overlooking a city of concrete buildings and its thousands of lit lights. the busy boulevard. a city where there can be millions of people yet none that i know of. strangely, i find that rather comforting knowing there're people around and moving beside me so i never feel alone.  there was this article i found in an mag bout 4 years back where they defined city residence as "capsule living". they discovered an increasingly large number of young people clamouring to the loft apartments with an ideal that living alone is the means to happiness (jeez). ala the mantra of "be who you want to be". unfortunately for us babies of gen X (or perhaps "lau chiao" of gen Y) , the cost of living and lack of space in singapore does not allow us the freedom of capsule living without the choking price.  take a look at SOHO (corner of river valley opp MITA) as the perfect example. lovely place but can we really afford that (unless of cos we're sons and daughters of OBS and the like)? and if we do find a place we can afford, can we not guarantee it's a flat in some absurd area of singapore where we still share lifts with stale pee and poke at phlegm covered lift buttons?  now...i've digressed from my sexy concrete have i not?

      had a strange dream last night. dreamt of an old friend and he played the sax to "bewitched, bothered and bewildered". *digressing: cher and rod stewart did a beautiful rendition of this song* he's never played the sax to my knowledge but he did last night.  we  had a long conversation at the jazz bar and updated each other on our current life happenings whilst it was snowing outside. its quite amazing really cos i haven't seen him in years and was wondering if he was still alive with his devil may care backpacking nomadic life.  i woke up with puffy eyes and could've sworn i had a slight hangover and the lingering notes of sax buzzing in my ears.

      i had a mortifying cab experience this morning.  "Xiao qie, yao chi na li? cabbie uncle "er...chi amoy street" "amoy street na li?" cabbie " amoy street er....next to telok ayer street..." " ni shi hua ren mah? ni de hua yu hao xiang bu yi yang oh..." cabbie  he then went on and on about how competent and impressive some japanese and caucasians are in mandarin and yet i'm chinese and not able to converse without breaking into english again. the rude man proceeded to snigger after his annoying lecture on yellow people who can't speak proficient mandarin.  instead of being annoyed at the sodding rude ass driver, i felt embarrassment pouring out of my yellow skin. an american born chinese can certainly be excused for his non-fluency but a singaporean chinese like me doesn't have a valid excuse does she?  or is it cos i grew up in a non-chinese speaking household? my dad speaks mandarin like a white man. my mom speaks mainly cantonese. and my grand folks rattle off in cantonese and hokkien. so where's the mandarin? or does it really matter how accurate we articulate our words as long as the listener grasps the gist?  what does being chinese mean? Am i being defined as "Hi. I'm yellow and i speak kick ass mandarin."

       urlLink    mighty eight pound bee with her mommy  she's the best mom around and probably is the only one who can take my shit and still love me. i'll bet she's got absolutely no idea what a little terror she's got cuddled in her arms then.  but of cos, my cheery policy's part of my current PR personality as seen. apparently, my irritation with crying babies began when i was a teeny one year old. mom said i used to turn around and stare/glare at screaming babies (but only cos they irked me with the noise i reckon). oh, and i got mommy free bus rides cos the bus inspectors adored the flirty baby. my folks were worried bout the silliest things. they thought i was "slightly retarded" cos i was a late walker. but they later discovered it was plain laziness and i would only crawl if necessary (pacifer as dangling carrot). as like now, i'll only walk if necessary. *i like to think of it as street smart, why work out so much when you can get people to carry you around?*  and the funniest part was my remote interest in playing "kitchen" (cooking and pots). now who said you can't tell the personality of a person through their early years?

QUIT the ciggies. with the $45 saved every month, i could buy a bott of decent red wine. i think i should start right now. the unopened pack of superslims shall stay as a memoir . or perhaps it would remain as my lifeboat when the sea gets rough some day. but for now, i'll need a strong mind and companion to keep them away.

       urlLink    mommy to be jiayi  met my old girl friend (since we were 13 years old) who flew back from HK last Thurs. it was a surprise cos she came back five months pregnant! it's kinda shocking and weird to see an old mate as a preggie now. she's the first amongst us to tie her vows and here she is again, leading the pack with a little one. she was like fine china to us that day. we've never had the opportunity to be around anyone pregnant so we ended up being idiotic with our overly deliberate carefulness.  she's mellowed down alot and its a small wonder how being a mommy can change one's personality.  oh well, it'll be a long and winding road to motherhood for the rest of us.
