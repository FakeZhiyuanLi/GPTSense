         You taught me how to kiss and where t put my hands. How to hold my head and when to pull away.          But then you taught me something noone else could.  You taught me how to love when I never thought I could.

              I told her i was over him.    I said,"It's your chance...    GO FOR IT!"    I told her i was over him    and that we were just friends.    I wouldn't be in the way.    I told her i was over him.    And i meant it too.    I told her i was over him.    And if that's true    Why does his grin still melt my heart    And his eyes still open my soul.    I told her i was over    But it's just not true  .
