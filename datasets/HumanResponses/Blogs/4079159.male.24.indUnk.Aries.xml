      I am back again... Tonight, Anju Bobby George will carry the  country's flag during the inaugral ceremony of Olympics at Athens..A 76 member contingent from India will be  participating in this great event... Good Luck my India... I am proud of you!!! On the other hand, within hours from now, Dhananjay will be  hanged to death. Dhananjay, who is charged with rape and murder of a school girl, will hanged, witnessed by 12 other people. I should admit that what he did was horrific, dirty, and very very rude..But, is killing someone the only way of punishing a person for a crime?? I have second thoughts..Think of his father, his mother, his wife, his children, ... We are a civilized nation with great psentimental and moral values... we are... are we???

      I think that you know that I believe I knew what I thought you said, and, that what I know is what you think you meant, and if what I thought you meant is not what you thought u meant, then, we must surely think this over again, for then, I'd know just what u meant, and you'd belive that I know what u said!

      A great sense of satisfaction... one that I have never felt so far in my life-time... yes!! I have realised that I can cook!! and I can cook well.. My first experiment in 24 years...and it was a grand success!! Just a couple of hours back I mastered the art, beginning with a pack of MTR tamarind rice mix.. Boiled water, soaked the pack in it for a while, and thatz it... The outcome was - delicious... really delicious - two servings of tamarind rice :) which I shared with my bro..And I made two cups of tea too... which I am already an expert at! In short, I have conquered the Kitchen... which had been dominated by the opposite sex for centuries... I am the new king in this territory, longing for more such adventures.. Shall try something different next weekend.. Hope it becomes a bigger success...Hey Shaggy: I am nowhere close to you..when it comes to cooking.... But will catch up with you soon!! Besides cooking, I also washed my clothes...and dried them... finally becoming a "good boy" after 24 years..trying to do things on my own... Watched a couple of business programmes and my fav. Mastermind India..no movies today :( How many digits are there in 100!(100-factorial)?? 158 digits..wow!! Let me get back to more math trivia ....

      Saturday... the monster head-ache stuck again... A deadly volcano coming up in my head.. and as always wasted the entire day trying to get out of it... And hunger woke me up in the middle of the night...The rains pouring down, I sat down with a can of biscuits and watched GAYAB and THE BLUE LAGOON.. Today, a not-so-active sunday... but feeling fresh... wanted to meet up with a couple of my friends... but the trains are stopped and my plans were washed out...so, spending the day at home.. Planning to try my skills in cooking... I have  to try and eat what I cook  i.e., have to punish myself :( ....

      This is how my weekend started...  Friday night.. had a nice heavy dinner.. watched "Missisippi Masala"... and I just loved the movie.. I don't know why, but I generally like movies based on Indians living abroad... and went to bed pretty soon... so that I can get up early and attend a talk..    then came saturday...  Got up late.. rushed to my institute to attend the 10 o'clock talk.. thinking it was at 10-30 :( Had to miss breakfast.. Oh god.. I was damn hungry... and as expected, my stomach started making a funny noise in the rather quiet classroom..There was a 15min. break, and I had a cup of hot coffee... wow.. It was refreshing.. Today's talk was about "two "easy" counting algorithms"... given by one of the Profs whose teaching skills I admire a lot.. It was mostly on graph based algos (Besides Steffi Graf, I love these graphs too...) Learnt a few new notations and terms, one which fascinated me being "Pfaffian" pronounced "fafian", "Fa" as in "Fa" deo, and "fian" as in "ruffian".. There is something called Pfaffian orientation... and so on ....The talk was interesting.. but I was almost lost during the last 10 mins.. I feel I have lost my intution... the intution I had in grasping math stuff... should work on it.. But intution is like creativity.. can't be taught.. and once lost, very very difficult to regain, as hard as NP complete problems...

      More than a week now... and the rain gods are still doing strong.. But the result??? If you think they are going to do good for the agriculture and consequently for the economy, they also do some undesired things...damage to life and property, huge losses due to cancellation of trains and flights out of busy cities, severely affecting commerce, spread of epidemics, etc.. where is the balance between agricultural boost and such a great loss?? Is there one?? I am just wondering.. Answers and opinions welcome...

I guess the rain gods do read my blogs.. they are not tired... they have come out with greater vim... and to prove me wrong.. and since yesterday night they have been on duty.. and no signs of them getting tired of their generosity.. and I am enjoying it :) ....

Yes.. You guessed it right... and I am 24 today, 3 years more than the legal age for getting married in India :) I would also like to add a few more good news on this very special day... First, CONGRATULATIONS to my techie brother-in-law for succesfully completing his MS and to my sister for completing her MCA.. Great going.. I haven't mailed them for a long time now :( .. But will do it soon :) My BEST WISHES to Abhishek and Sunayana on their wedding Aniv.. I wish I were in UIUC to celebrate it with you people...and Welcome home to my CEO friend who is coming back from NY after a long trip.. come fast.. I am waiting for the snaps..and yes thanks to my quiet junior who wished me as soon as I entered my lab.. :) Now, flash-back: what have I achieved in 24 years.. amy be almost two-thirds of my life-time.. if I were to live long..??? Did I acheive what Tendulkar achieved with his bat when he was 24?? A big NO... Am I as skilled as my fav. Schumi who had a few podium finishes when he was 24?? NO again.. Am I as energetic as even younger Jenson Button, who looks promising...who is eventually going to make me stick to F1 even after Schumi retires?? Again NO!! :( :( But yes.. I have managed something.. Had four wonderful years of my life at a place far away from Civilization... made wonderful friends... and reasons for a lifetime full of happiness...Leave me in a room of ten strangers and I can come out with ten good friends in ten minutes... thatz what I have acheived in 24 years.. managed to get a sister too... Now back to Operation-centric hardware synthesis.....
