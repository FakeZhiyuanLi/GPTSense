       Well this afternoon has been odd.  I talked to Ross, that was fun, we decided we would be friends w/ benefits cuz come on, its fun.  I mean its not like something is goin to come of it and its not botherin anyone and it wont hurt anyone so its all good, lol.  Well we had fun discussin that.  Then it was odd, someone told Arik to call me, cuz he called me cell, which I didnt give him my number, *got to find out who did that*  We talked, he felt bad so did I but even though we said sorry, it just doesnt do all the work to fix everything, ya know.  I got AIM back and now I have a real reason to be on cuz Nate, omg great guy, so funnie.  Well, I had an interesting talk w/ Arik, and then w/ Ross.  I think me and Ross know whats goin to happen in the future for people but no one will listen to us, or they say o'no things are different, nah, its the same.  If only they would listen to me and Ross, we could help them spare heart break but who would listen to the two of us, o'well.  I guess like Ross said, in a couple of months we can say, I told you so, lol.  But it just wont feel right ya know cuz it would still suck.  But w/e happens happens, and we cant stop it.  All I know, is that the past is the past and I will NEVER NEVER NEVER repeat it, not for anyone, not even for my own short term happiness.  Things are goin pretty good now, *yay*  I have decided that I will not have any relationship in the near future, just friends w/ benefits cuz if I keep it that way I wont get hurt.  I dont want to fall in love anytime soon, and it suckz.  Cuz all my life thats all I ever wanted and now I'm scared.  Why fall in love?  I'll just get hurt like alwayz, *sigh*  Maybe some day, my prince charmin will arrive and sweep me off my feet, but  eh, he probably will turn out to be a jackass like the rest.  I'm startin to realize, the only guy I can trust really is Ross, yeah it suckz to be you Ross, sorry its true, lol.  You know its odd, cuz I'm happy yet not the happy I want.  I'm happy w/ my life except you know, I'm misin that one key thing, but I'm not ready for it.  Maybe I never will, maybe I never will find that right guy, that one thats suppost to sweep me off my feet and carry me away into the sun set, *sigh*  Maybe what I need to do, is to start to trust again, eh, thats hard one.  I have alwayz been so trustin, now I cant.  Its like everything I was before, I'm not anymore.  I hate it, its like I cant be me anymore, I think the real me, went off and died, to much pain and stress.  I know my heart built up this really big wall, its big, trust me, I looked at it today.  I dont think she will be lettin anyone in for quite sometime.  My soul, I dont know, I think she decided to go eary to visit God, she wont come back for a while either.  The rest, my body is still here, ask Casey, lol, he would know.  But the real me, the person I was, isnt here anymore.  I miss her, that was the good part, the part I loved, now its replaced by something different, not me.  Maybe one day, the real me would decided to come back, when my heart decideds to let down the wall, and my soul decided vacation is over, maybe then.  But I know for a fact, I will never be what I was once.  I'll never be able to be so open and so trustin and so lovin.  For now, I have to protect myself f/ any guy I meet, cuz I never know who is there to love me, or use me.  It suckz, I never thought I would have to live like this, I was such a trustin person, *sigh*  Look at me now, lol, I hide my hurt, my pain, I put a smile for everyone to see.  Never to expose what deep down, not trustin enough to let anyone see that.  *sigh*  Look at me now!

       Life's good, as good as it can get, lol.  I have deleted AIM, never have to deal w/ that shit again, lol.  I got a new cell phone, so so so much kewler then my old one, by a long shot, call me anytime, lol 641-344-6422.  Me and Casey are haven fun again, lol.  We seem to do that alot, sperate, then get back together, I think that shows either how horny we are, lol, or we're just that good of friends.  I'll miss him when he goes to college, I accually will, cuz underneath what everyone see's there is a good person, just he doesnt like to show that side.  We do things besides just make out, or me read his Playboy, we accually talk. I got to know a lot more about him over this past summer, lots of personal stuff, we're open and honest cuz we know what we say wont hurt each others feelins, I can tell him about my past w/ different guyz different feelins and that shit, and he could do the same.  So people, I do talk when I hang w/ Casey not just make out, like y'all think thats all we do, jeeze, tisk tisk, shame shame, lol. Well, I dont know what else to write, probably have some fun thing to write to nite cuz I'm either goin to the movies, *hopefully* or probably end up hangin w/ Casey, so if ya need me, call me, my cell is alwayz on! Lata!!

       Well, just got home f/ hangin w/ Casey.&nbsp; It was fun, he and I talked at work and it was fun. So&nbsp;he was like can we hang out to nite and I was like sure.&nbsp; Well, he called me later on and we decided to hang out.&nbsp; It was great fun, *evil smile*&nbsp; I cant help it, we decided to be friends w/ benefits.&nbsp; Its just great fun cuz we know nuttin will come of this and we can be really silly and dumb and not worry.&nbsp; He had some Playboys w/ him, so I sat and looked at them while he gave me a boob massage, he was impressed cuz I was talkin about the chics boobs.&nbsp; I got jealous cuz I like this chics nipple's and he just laughed at me.&nbsp; He liked the fact that I was just open to sayin anything and I wasnt some shy prude or anything.&nbsp; I think thats why we get a long so much cuz we are alike, we arent afraid to say things or act all shy or anything.&nbsp; Its just great fun!&nbsp; Well, thats all I wanted to say so... Nite, Nite!

       I found some poems that teens have written and I really like, and I thought hey, I'll put them on my blog, hehe.  Everything faded memories Of what we could of been So many lost thoughts I think so differently from What I though then. I thought something was destined I thought it was real Im crazy to think anything was there I was nuts to tell you how I feel But I cant go back in time And change what I said Instead of running away Im gonna run ahead It is time to let down these walls That you built around me for so long Its time for me to face my fears And find the strength to be strong. There is so much more out there That I need to find. Im sick of being stuck to you In what seems like just frozen time But hey youll find someone better Maybe I even will too We are to young To keep watching the same re-run Over and Over and Over and after again I guess that makes you right......we are just better as friends.   You say you want to "just be friends" You dont want me to cry But you cant even bring yourself To look me in the eye How can I be friends with you When I love you so much And every time I close my eyes I remember your soft touch Why did you say you loved me If you knew it would end like this? Then I hear myself ask you For one last goodnight kiss As you lean down towards my face A tear falls from my eye I remember all we'd been through Now I have to say good-bye How rage flows through my veins Just as your lips brush my cheek You broke my heart in pieces Now I see that I was weak I've changed alot since then Sometimes I still think of you Now I dont feel love or hate For the boy who broke my heart in two!

       Haha, I didnt know what to put so I put that, I'm weird I know.&nbsp; Well, last nite I went on a walk w/ my dog and that was so much fun, but what was freakie was that this guy drove by and he smiled and waved at me, then he passed by me, he stuck his head out the window and smiled at me some more, I was scared, he could have been a freak or something.&nbsp; O'well, I got to see The Notebook last nite, I cried.&nbsp; The ending is so sweet but at the same time sad.&nbsp; I knew f/ the beginning the old people were Noah and Ali.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just such a sweet movie, its like you know f/ the beginning that she would choose him, awww, I love it!!&nbsp; Then we are goin to the movies either tomorrow or Saturday cuz The Village is playin and we all want to see that, so everyone, we are goin!!&nbsp; Just dont know when, lol!&nbsp;  In other news, I was goin to solve a problem but I'll have to wait a few more dayz cuz the person is gone, grr, frustration, but it gives me more time to figure out which questions to ask him and shit like that, so hopefully by the end of the weekend things will be some what a lil better.&nbsp; Eh, o'well! Umm, lets see, I think thats about it for now, also I have to work today, first time in over a week and half, ugh.&nbsp; I'm goin to get so lost cuz they have totally switched everything again, I hate when they do that, o'well, maybe after my physical I can go to work and check it out, maybe. Well, thats it, for now, I might be back later to talk, doubt it, but just maybe, if some Earth shatterin news comes my way then I will be back, doubt that will happen but you never know. I've learned to expect anything, cant ya tell?&nbsp; Something alwayz comes when I least expect it too, o'well, its all good, keeps my life interesting! Lata!

       Now, its time to start over.&nbsp; A new life, a new atittude, new blog, new start.&nbsp; I want a fresh start, but to have a truely fresh start is to fix all the wrongs that either I or someone has done to me, but I cant do that.&nbsp; My heart is broken, it will heal, it alwayz does.&nbsp; But this time is different, its not just a simple, I'm sorry to fix it.&nbsp; This time, it will take months maybe even years to truely forgive.&nbsp; Heh, maybe when I get my pictures back f/ NYE my heart will be more open to forgive, but no one understands what I feel.&nbsp; I can sit and cry and tell the story but to some they may get, maybe understand some of it, but no one can truely understand.&nbsp; Maybe there is someone out there that can, but till I meet that person, I dont know.&nbsp; Now that I got all the yellin down w/, said what I felt, slept on it, I might try and talk.&nbsp; Honestly, I dont think my heart will ever be able to heal f/ this one. Its learned to forgive, its had to do that a lot recently, but this time is so much more then just a simple I'm sorry to fix it.&nbsp; This is more then just hurtin me, its betrayin me in the worst possible way.&nbsp; Its like how can I trust what they are sayin to me, when all week they lied.&nbsp; If they were honest f/ the bein how the felt, I could forgive them but dragin me deeper into this, its hard.&nbsp; I know its to soon to say I forgive you, it may not be w/i the next year that I can honestly say that but hopefully I can start to try and forgive them, but its not easy!&nbsp; I have done all my cryin, no more, but my heart still hurts deeply.&nbsp; Heh, last nite, I remember something he said, he was like look at us, is this what you want? Heh, like thats what I want, me to hate him, I dont hate him, just so so disappointed.&nbsp; I never said I hated him, and I dont think that I do, its more that I was angry at what he did and just so disappointed in him.&nbsp; I wish there was a way to go back and chage it all but I cant, so I have to deal w/ what he did.&nbsp; I have to live w/ the actions he choose to do.&nbsp; If only he was honest f/ the beginning.&nbsp; If only he would stop and realize that he may hurt but I hurt worse.&nbsp; I hurt in the worst possible way, I believe and trusted him w/ everything and he betrays me in the worst way, what am I suppost to say or do now?

       Okay well yesterday I went shoppin w/ Cassie and Jess at the Jordan Creek Mall, *new mall*  Well on the way up I showed them my pics f/ NYE, they just keep laughin at me.  Well, then I told them about how Arik accidenty hit my head on the brick wall, well Cassie thought I might have suffered a concussion cuz ever since that day I have been gettin dizzy spills and I get very painful headaches.  Well, we went shoppin, we walked all over the mall, we know where everything is now!  We walked by Fossil and I saw this person well he didnt move so I thought it was a manquien, so I asked Cassie really loud if it was but then I saw the guyz eyes move so I figured out he wasnt.  I felt really bad, it was a very good laugh though.  We went into that story, or walked by it so many times cuz he was so HOT!!!  His ass, wow, now that a masterpiece, lol.  But we just called him "manequien man" all day, lol.  We had a couple of guyz follow us but then we lost them.  Then we had another couple of guyz follow us, but again we lost them.  Neither group was that hot.  Ross should be proud of me, we went into Hot Topic three times.  I got a Grumpy Bear shirt, it says Who Cares, it so cute.  I also got a Grumpy Bear purse w/ a Grumpy Bear wallet.  Also, I found the best shirt ever, well Cassie pointed it out.  At the Buckle, I love that place now, it had an AC-DC Razers Edge shirt, I got it and also a Lynard Skenerd, I got it too.   Then we went to a music store and I got the AC-DC Razers Edge cd to go w/ the shirt and also, Shinedowns cd, haha, I got it not you Ross, lol.  Well Casey called me while we were at the mall and we made plans to hang out.  When I got home, I finally told my mommie about the head hittin thing and since she was a nurse once and her mom was a nurse to, she told me that I did suffere a concussion, *thankz a lot Arik, lol*  So me and Casey hung out that nite, we had fun.  Learned a few new things, lol.  Dont ask, cuz I doubt any of you guyz want to know.  Then I came home and just sat around and then went to bed.  Now, its Saturday late late morning, I have to go to work in about an hour, *ugh*  But thats okay cuz at 2 Jennifer comes in so we will have fun like alwayz, *yay* Well, that fills ya up to whats been happen so I"m outa here, LATA!

       Well, okay, lets start w/ yesterday.  I called Arik to apologize, and it end up we both apologized.  We discussed our moods swings, lol.  I felt good then he called me later and left a funnie thing on call wave.  Well I called him back and again we had a fun time talking.  So my day was great then we talked on the net, things were goin good then one thing just set it off.  I told him I need help w/ something, well that set off that I need to act serious and that I need to grow up and stand on my own two feet.  Well after that I was kinda upset, then I talked to Ross and he just made it all beter, go Ross! Today, I sat around, and was a total dittz.  I talked to Arik today and we cleared things up and he said he wasnt pissed at all just frustrated but he wasnt frustrated anymore, so it was all good.  Me and Ross goofed off, I found quotes that fit our friendship to the t, it was so funnie.  But wow, today I was so out of it.  I was sittin on my couch and I was goin to say I'm so bored, but I instead said, I'm four, lol.  I then fell laughin my ass off to the ground and rolled right into the fan.  When I was sittin at the computer I keep hittin my knee on the desk. Well then finally went to see the Village, it suckz!!  I only got scared at one part and that was in part to Ty.  Me and Ty goofed off so much, we got *shh* at, jeeze. I keep hurtin myself, thankz to Ty.  He keep ticklin me and I keep hittin the arm of the chair, it hurt!  I had a blast even though the movie sucked.  Afterwards I was wearin my Hooters shirt, first this lady thought I worked there, then guyz keep wavin at me.  So Ty was like stand on the corner, so I did but no one came.  So we had fun, then I came home, and now sittin on my ass.  I think I might head to bed soon cuz I have to get up at 8 tomorrow to go shoppin at the new mall in West Des Moines w/ Cassie and Jess, *yay*  We're goin to find all the hot guyz.  I'm goin to smack their asses, lol.  Its great, so I'm off.  Nite Nite!

       Humm, how do I say what I've done today.  Well, first off, yeah me and Ross did hack into Tara's hotmail, and had a lil fun.  Sent an e-mail to Arik, tellin him about Tara keepin Ross's e-mails.  Then today hack onto her aim, there again, we had fun.  I talked to Arik, he bought that I was Tara's mother.   Now that created some good laughs, humm.  After I read Arik's blog and what he said about me, really hurt.  I let a comment tellin him that it was me that was pretendin to be Tara's mom.  I dont know what came over me, but I got on, and Arik was away.  I left a comment, tellin him how I felt, deep down.  I told him how I was jealous of the past cuz back then I had a great life.  I told him how I missed havin a dear friend.  We got into that talk, we both admited that we were each others dearest friends, and that we both wanted that again.  I know it was real but you know, after we talked, I still had doubts.  Its hard, I want it so bad to be like before but I know deep down it can never be like that, there will alwayz be boundries.  I wont ever be as open or honest or any of that w/ him.  Maybe one day things could turn out to be like it was before.  Wow, its weird to be jealous of the past.  There is alwayz these what if's that come to mind.  I looked at old pics f/ Synold, now thats a tear jerker.  I wish I could for the rest of my life live that week, over and over.  But I cant, I'm startin slowly acceptin the past can never come back.  I have a feelin, which I hate, this "friendship" me and him are tryin to build back wont last long.  He gets very angry at my easy, I alwayz seem to let him down.  I give him a week, by then he will hate me once more.  *sigh*  what have I gotten myself into?

       Well, its been a good day.  Umm, I woke up, sat around, wished I could tan but I couldnt.  Talk to Ross, we made a new pack.  If neither of us is married by age 30, we will get married and have kids.  See, since we are so hot, we're goin to have hot kids and we're goin to put them in show business and make money off of them, lol.  I got to finally talk to Bri today, that was fun and new.  We havent talked all summer long.  Dustin is comin home tomorrow, I get to finally see him again, omg its been so long!!  Well, me and her talked, I told her some things that I havent even told God about, so that was good, to get things out in the open.  I did that yesterday when I talked to Kait.  Then, I went shoppin in West Des Moines.  My cousin works at the Best Buy by the new mall so we got a discount.  I got the best cd, three disc, 80's Hair Metal, my daddie was so jealous.  Well, we even drove through Lorimor, I was lookin to see if I might see Ty, no luck, o'well.  I'll get to see him either tomorrow or Thursday nite cuz we are goin to the movies to see, The Village, *yay*  Now, I'm sittin here talkin, and listenin to my cd.  On the way home f/ Des Moines, I was thinkin, the only thinkin I do between me and God, I wonder if he heard me,  hopefully.  Tonite we will have a long converstation about somethings.  Omg, wow, so many things are goin through my mind right now, I wish I could write them down for people to see but I dont know if thats sucha wise thing to do, specially when I'm not ready to be open w/ people about them.  Maybe after a while I could write it all down, *shrug* Other news, me and Ross are offically sick of Arik and Tara.  His speakin his mind, and I'm allowed to too.  Well, first off, I know it wont last, please.  Its the same thing over and over, he gets the chic so obsessed w/ him that he gets anything he wants.  Then he gets bored and ditches her for someone else.  Come on, been there twice, and seen it w/ my own eyes.  I'm not dumb, he says its for real, please, give me a barf bag.  She's already so obsessed, by the time Council comes around and  he dont get want he wants, he will ditch her.  I know his just in love w/ the fact that he can get a chic so obsessed w/ him.  He dont know what love is, I know more about love then he will ever know.  He just wants to feel needed and important to someone, its true.  Thats all he ever wanted f/ me.  Once he gets sick of Tara, he will move on.  Probably by the time school starts he will find a new chic, and use them both.  He'll keep Tara around for the cyber or phone sex and then use the chic f/ school for the physical things.  If ya dont believe me, your screwed cuz I've been there twice.  I know Arik better then anyone else, I can tell you exactly want he wants, how he will do it, and how it will end.  Please it dont take a genis to figure it out.  And dont even think your goin to go off and say, "Oh, she's jealous"  Please lol,  if I was jealous I would be tryin to win him over, and dont worry I bet I could, just show a couple of things and bam right back.  But he wants fresh meat, someone he could easy fool into doin things, he knows I'm smarter then that, but Tara, he could get her wrapped up in his finger in a snap, and thats what he did.  He'll have his way and buh bye Tara before you know it.  I give them about two months and he will already find a new girl to try and win over.  Then I can sit here and have a good laugh cuz I will know I was right.  So dont give me that bullshit that "oh we're in love".  Haha, she talks about her future w/ him, omg, I sat many nites discussin our future.  We planned honeymoon, planned a weddin, planned how many kids we were goin to have.  If she thinks she is the only one he does that w/, his done it w/ ever girlfriend he has ever had.  Come on, his a playa, he wants a piece of ass, and if she dont give it, she's outa here.  So Tara if ya read this, please listen cuz if you dont, your goin to get fucked over and no one will be there to pick up the pieces cuz we will all say Told you so!!

       Well, this weekend has been fun but boring kinda.  I havent hung out w/ Casey since Thursday cuz it he works at nite, and I wont hang w/ him till sometime after Monday cuz Monday I will be out of town, o'well.  I talked w/ Ross the other day, and we are plannin a party.  Hopefully it will be me, him, Christine, Ashley, Nate, and Hannah.  Haha, I hope it works out cuz shit it will be the shitz. That would be something to remember.  *finger crossed*  Other news, I saw Doug today, omg, its been like almost a year since I lasted seen him, wow, HIS SO HOTT!  Why did I break him, his so hot!  If I wasnt workin,  I would walk up and grab his ass cuz his got the best ass there ever is or will be, wow!  *moment to remember the ass!*  But its not like I like him, plz. Its just, he was my first love, and first love alwayz stays w/ you.  Wow, when I saw him, that old feelin came back for just a minute.  It was nice, I was surpised but nice.  I know that nuttin will ever happen between us again, and I'm so happy cuz I dont want anything but its nice to see him, and to remember.  I'm allowed to remember, arent I? Also, I figured out a lot of things last nite, cant write down cuz no one would understand and right now, its something that should only be discussed between me and God.  Maybe down the road when I figure out everything then I'll tell, who knows when that will be.  I guess only time will tell, haha.  So till something new happens, I'm outa here!

       Wow, sometimes you dont realize things till a while after it happens.  I have never realized how much I have grown up since last summer.  Its kinda scary in a way, if ya think about it.  So much has happen in a lil over a year.  Haha, somethings were a real lesson to help me grow up.  Haha, I think of what it was like when I dated Doug, how was I so dumb and so childish and just so lived in the moment and never wanted to wake up f/ the dreamland I lived in.  I look back now and laugh, I learned somethings f/ that but nuttin that holds importance to me.  Now everything that happened after me and Doug were over w/, was something that I hold and remember.  Cuz if you forget anything f/ your past you are doomed to repeat it, I would know that the hard.  Haha, my church friends, never really called them that, but everyone else did.  Kait, Arik, and Ross really helped me to grow as person.  Even Tara helped me to grow.  She made me see that there are people out there that will hate me for me, and not for something I do or say.  I alwayz thought that there had to be a reason for why someone hates you, she showed me different.  Kait, wow, we have our moments of being so silly, but those deep converstations were alwayz so helpful, some where hard to discuss but she has seen the light as I like to say, lol.  Arik, lol, we all know that story, some more then others.  With him, I truely realized what it was like to lose the closest friend you will ever have and trust me, you dont want to feel that.  He brought all the heart ache I suffered then and now, no offense, sometimes anger still comes around, but thats taught me so much.  I realize things now that I didnt then.  I owe him a lot for what I have learned most of it is sad stuff but I still learned, and now I know so much lol.  And the person who accually has taught me the most vaulable stuff, Ross!  Yes, Ross you have taught me a lot.  He taught me about life, I mean if it wasnt for some converstations we had, I dont know where I be, porbably not alive, and thats the honest truth.  He helped me when no one would, he became the closest person to me, and still is.  He knows stuff that no one else knows, and its cuz I trust him.  I might not be his best friend, lol, but he is my closest friend right now.  I mean we have had our rough moments, who doesnt.  But the only two fights we have ever had lasted the longest three dayz, lol.  Lol, just thinkin about things we talk about on the phone, makes me die laughin.  The two of us have been through a lot in less then a year cuz we never really were friends till October or November.  I dont even know how we really became friends, we just started talking and never have stoped, lol.  He has taught me what a best friend is suppost to be, what its like to truely trust someone and know they will never betray you.  I owe so much to Ross, poor guy, his suffered so much of my shit, I love ya Ross, your my bud!!  Ya still smell, lol.  Well, I just thought I would share that w/ the world, so I'm outta here, Lata!

       Well, lets start w/ yesterday, umm but not the whole day.  Well, yesterday Ross was talking to Tara, he was telin me everything she said.  He was trying to get the dirt.  My computer went crazy so I called him so he could fill me in.  He said how he didnt want to get tied down, well she said that she found her someone or something like that, and I said something funnie, so I told him to tell her, well then she said something that had to do w/ being a slut, and duh we all know that didnt have to do w/ Ross.  So, I need a reason to start talkin to her so I had one.  Well, I first asked her why she called me a slut.  She tried to act like she had no clue but I filled her in that I know what she said cuz I was on the phone w/ Ross and that she might have not said directly towards me but we all know it was.  She said she didnt mean it to anyone, *bullshit*  So then I asked her why she has alwayz hated me.  She said it had something to do w/ Snyod.  I told her I never did anything to her at Synod or any other time, she has alwayz been a bitch to me.  She told me that she dont remember what set it off but she was alwayz jealous of mine and Ross's friendship.  Umm, so I was like if you loved him like you said you did you would trust him, she said she did trust him but not me.  I said I have never done anything to make you worry.  She said that I alwayz talked about Ross.  I said I never talked to her, she said she read it in my blogs.  Well, the only times I would write about Ross is either cuz he did something stupid or he help me, which he did a lot.  Then I said well, if your looking for a slut look right in the mirror, cuz I'm not like you, I dont go around sayin I love someone and mess around w/ their best friend.  That got to her, she was quite which she did that a lot, I make her speechless, then she said that I should stop pickin at her life and deal w/ my own.  I said I dont lie so I dont have anything to worry about, unlike her.  She blocked me, I got onto other ones but she blocked them too, *shrug* Well, today I had band camp.  Casey showed up, which was weird.  Well it was boring, me and Jess goofed off a lot.  Then during lunch time I came, Arik was on, and he was like Why did you start a fight w/ Tara.  I said I didnt start a fight, I spoke my peace.  We talked and I told him how she called me a slut, and he was like you called her one too but I was like cuz she got on my nerves, and she is more of one then me.  Well he brought up how I do more then she has, but I have at least done it w/ the same guy.  He refered me as a slut but later said I wasnt.  Umm, make up your mind.  Well, I said at least I havent cheated on my boyfriends like she has.  Well he brought up the Casey and Ty and accually thats not cheatin cuz me and Casey never did anything while me and Ty were together and me and Casey said we were not together like that, just friends, so yeah, take it how you want.  And that one time before, all I did was kiss Ty twice, and pretty much me and Casey were broke up by then, so yeah, dont look much like cheating, unlike her.  Anywayz, we got into that, I got pissed, but I keep my cool.  We got to talkin and he told me how he stood up for me, I appreciated that.  He promised me that if she ever dissed or said anything about me and I found out to personaly tell Arik and he will personaly deal w/ it.  No offense Arik but I will tell you but I cant promise I wont deal w/ it myself too.  Well and no offense Arik but your promises have never worked, they alwayz seem to find a way to break, so its kinda hard, ya know.  I'm trying but its not as easy as it looks or sounds.  Well, after that crazy, I went back to band, goofed off, Casey gave me a ride home, he said that sometime soon we will hang out again.  Umm, then after supper I went on a walk w/ my daddie and my puppy.  After the walk we went to the farm to hang out w/ my uncles and cousins.  Now I'm finally home, well, Ross just got on so I'm think I'm goin to go, Nite Nite!!

       I swear fighting never seems to stop, its like in love w/ me and my friends, *shrug*  Well, which problem saw we look at first, hummm, how about me and Tara.  So, we know she hates me, since the moment she laid eyes on me, *shrug*  Well, it finally exploxed.  Kait, I feel horrible, she has to go through so much pain.  I mean I'm finally understand what she goes through but I dont know how she puts up w/ it and then doesnt say anything about.  Finally she let it out, something I believe she should have done a long time, she doesnt deserve to hold it all in.  She spoke her peace, I was thankful that she did, she need to, she told the truth, yes I admit, it kinda hurt, but its nuttin that would upset me.  It open my eyes to what I need to try and do, what I need to fix.  It helped me to realize I havent been that grand of a friend, I swear I'll make up, I'll do w/e I can.  I promise, I'll try and talk to Tara but she has blocked so I dont know how.  To Tara, I know you read this, I know someone close to you had something to do w/ comment, to be honest I dont care that they left one, if it was trying to upset me or anything it didnt work, I busted out laughin.  Ross also said that you have an aunt who's name starts w/ an L, so maybe there could be a connection.  I dont know, but if you had something to do w/ it, just admit, and talk to me, I wont yell.  Yes I have done a lot of things that have been very childish and stupid, but I know and I do apologize, I just wish you could grow up and apologize to me f/ how you have treated me.  I dont ask for a friendship, all I ask for is truce, that we stop this, its killing Kait, I hate to see her like this.  If you can let go of w/e it is that you hold against me that you have held against me since Synod, then I promise that I'll grow up too.  We just need to stop, its stupid, all it does is cause pain to people we love, if we end it now the better.  We dont have to be all lovie dovie friends or w/e, but at least then everyone can be at peace.  So do we have a deal?  On to other news, Ross and Arik.  Okay, I'm not taken sides, I shouldnt even be caught in this but I'm.  Its probably my choose.  I think in time all wounds will be healed.  Maybe not till 20 years down the road but I believe it will.  I mean if me and Arik can heal our friendship then you two can.  I have faith in it. If not, I'll force you to sit and smell my feet, lol.  No seriously, I think space is good, very good.  Take that break off, and one day when you both are willing you can sit down and have a real heart to heart cuz I believe that all takes is a simple conversation.  Just tell each other how you feel and see what happens, sometimes you would surpised at what happens.  But remember, you two may dislike each other but I still love both of you, so deal w/ it, and you both will alwayz be in my life, sorry its true.  You will have to put up w/ my craziness till my dieing breath, so just remember that, cuz if you forget then I'll just have to remind you, lol. So w/ all that said, I feel better, so I'm off to enjoy this peace and quiet of having the house to myself!

       Okay, first off, I would like to set the record straight, my last blog was honest and true but let me filll you in on how I have changed since then. Arik, if you are reading this, listen, you know you are the first person I ever felt really close to, you were my first true friend, and you should know, that no matter what, you alwayz will be my friend. I love ya Toothpick, I cant lose you. Remember, sometimes feelings get confused, but if you ever need me, I'm there in a heart beat. Plus if you ever think about leavin my side, your dead cuz I'll make you smell my feet after work, and trust me, thats goin to kill ya. I alwayz will have a special place in my heart for ya, it was put there when I meet you and it gets bigger as time goes on, and when I die, my spirit will follow you around, dont worry Ross, it will follow you too, lol. Wow, that means my spirit will have a stressful time, followin two people around, thats okay she can do it, I have faith in her.  Also, she is not an it, so no one call her an it, she gets pissed, lol. In other news, x-country started yesterday. OMG, I'm so sore, I can barely walk. If a move a lil bit, my legs kill. No pain no gain, lol. Also, me and Ross are trying to works things out so I can go to the Nickleback and Puddle of Mudd concert w/ him. *fingers crossed* hopefully everything goes good. It all depends on what my uncle is doin and if he will be willing to let me stay at his place which I bet anything he will cuz he loves me and I stay there all the time. So my bets are that I will be goin w/ Ross to the concert, *yay* Umm, so thats about all thats been goin on, so I'm outta here for now, I might have to update later on or something, so till then... Nite Nite!

       I swear sometimes you just want to give up and run away and block everything out.  Maybe its just me that likes to do that.  Eh, last nite I was talkin to both Ross and Arik at the same time, two different people, two different views on the samething.  To both I was talkin about my friendship w/ Arik.  Arik had told me that I'm his best friend alwayz have been, that if one day we stop talkin he would find me and make me live w/ him, lol, he also said that he so wants to hang out w/ me at YC and he will make it happen.  Haha, that last one is a bit tough to believe, we all know Tara wont have it, and personaly I'm sick of the fightin so I dont know.  I'll let him deal w/ that, if he wants to hang, he will make that step.  But it was hard, he called me his best friend, that I alwayz have been, so desperatly I wanted to say it back but I couldnt, I dont know why then maybe the hurt was still there, I didnt want to lie and say yes you are just to make him feel good and leave me w/ guilt, I wont lie.  When I talked to Ross, he told me to watch out, Arik was leading me into the trap again, eh, its possible.  Ross was like your my best friend, and I was like and your mine, nuttin will change that.  I was torn, who to trust, I mean they both have this special place in my heart, but I know that either of them could be right, but I doubt both can be right.  I was torn and confused, so I went to the source for help, I asked God.  I sat and talked about everything, and I came to a conclussion,  my friendship w/ Arik is impossible.  It could never be a real friendship cuz we can only talk on the net, never really hang out or see each other cuz we all know who wouldnt like that.  He tries to say it is different, I delt w/ it for a year w/ Ross, I know its not any different.  No one knows better then me, sorry Arik, you cant just change how she feels about things specially when it comes to me.  I cried for so long, I didnt want to face that its the only way.  When I stoped I thought of things I could do, block him, get rid of some things and just not deal w/ him, till it was time that maybe we could be friends.  Well, this morning I woke up an hour before I was suppost to, I had time to think.  I realized I could never really block Arik out, I mean its impossible, his my friend, I realized that w/ all the shit we have put each other through, his still my friends, maybe not as good as before, but I cant just walk away f/ that friendship, all the hard work we put into maken it work, I just cant quiet.  I know its still seems impossible, eh, something I hate, I hate to be confided to talkin only through the computer to one of my best friends, wouldnt you?  I mean to know you can see each other every month but no you cant talk or hang out or goof off cuz there is that imaginary wall blocking it.  I have alwayz hated it when someone told me I could not hang out w/ someone, I would stop at nuttin to prove them wrong.  I did that w/ Ross, only after we become close, but that was easy.  This time its not just Tara I have to deal w/ its also Ross.  I know Ross would never tell me, no you cant hang w/ that person, he wouldnt stop me, thats what I love, he never tells me what I cant or can do, never passes judgement, he warn me plenty of times but thats it.  *sigh*  I cant do this, I cant struggle w/ this, I give all power to Arik, he makes the atempt to hang and be my friend then I'll do the same, but he has all power now, cuz I suck w/ the power and it just drains everything out of me.
