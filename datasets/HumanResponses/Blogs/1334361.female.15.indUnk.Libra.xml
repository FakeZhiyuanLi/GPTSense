       Of the days   Song of the day:  Holding Me ~ Lauren Talley  Movie of the day:  None  Book of the day:  The Hangman's Curse by Frank Peretti  Scripture Verse of the day:  "For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it. " -Matthew 7:13-14   I had a pretty good day today. Cynthia and I talked for like 3 HOURS. Wow! We just had some awesome talks. Tomorrow we're going to the movies together! I can't wait, it should be fun. :-)  I think I disappointed a friend today though. I didn't mean to make him upset. But I can't help the way I feel. He's a great guy, and I really appreciate his advice, but I..guess I'm on my own now. :-( I guess I get sick of people preaching to me..I just feel like, "LEAVE ME ALONE". I understand that these friends care about me..but I just don't think they know what they're talking about. *shrugs* If I get hurt..then oh well...who cares? *shrugs*  Anyhow...  I think we're going to the June Jamboree tonight! Woohoo! :-) It should be fun, I just hope it don't rain. Tonight's the only night we'll get to go.  Tomorrow is the "Dateable Bash"! It's gonna be SOO MUCH FUN! :-D I can't wait! And on Saturday we have some puppet stuff to take care of, and then we have a show on Sunday..so woohoo... :-)  Later.. -Jama

      I noticed that I hadn't really posted anything about myself, so I will now..   Name:  Jama (Jay-mah)  Age:  15  DOB:  Sept. 24  From:  Indiana, US    Favourite-     Colour:  Lavender  Band:  Superchic[k] (hence the name)  Type of Music:  Southern Gospel (but I like just about everything..just as long as it's clean)  Place to shop:  Kohl's  Brand of clothing:  JOHN DEERE!!! I'm a John Deere freak!!! ;-)   A little bit about myself:  I'm a born-again Christian, and I'm not afraid to admit that. I'm a regular church-goer, and I enjoy any church activity. But don't think that since I'm a Christian, I don't have fun..because I have LOTS of fun! It's great. Some of my fave bands (besides Superchic[k]) are: Kutless, Sanctus Real, Grits, and KJ-52  Here is me.. =)    I really enjoy taking pictures of people, scenery and anything that'll hold still long enough for me to take a picture! =) Here's a few of my fave "storm" shots..       Here are some flowers..    This one's my favourite.    That's all for now.. -Jama

        Currently-    Watching:  The News  Eating:  Nothing  Listening to:  Nothing  Today has been nice, I'm super tired though. I got up at about 8AM this morning, and got a shower. That does a number on me! ;-)  I've had alot on my mind lately, and I've realized that things in my life were going pretty well. Now everything just seems to be crumbling to pieces. I REALLY REALLY like this guy, and it's not just some "kiddie crush". I REALLY like him. He became a Christian on Easter, and he was like "perfect". Recently, he's been having some problems though. He keeps taking off, and I don't know what's going to happen. I don't think he realizes how much I care for him. Maybe he feels like no one cares at all. *shrugs*  So anyways, tonight is Cowboy Church, should be fun. I can't wait to get out of this house! =)  -Jama

        Currently-    Watching:  The Computer Screen  Eating:  Chips (I was eating chicken..but it didn't taste very good!)  Listening:  A mower  Reading:  The Hangman's Curse - Frank Peretti  Yesterday was a nice day. We had a puppet show, and it went very well. The church is small, but it was a very cute church. I loved where it was -- in the country. Very nice! The people were so nice, and they gave a us a free lunch. (which was REALLY good!)  After all of that, I went back to my aunt and uncles house. They went to a birthday party for a woman who turned 105 yesterday! Wow! My cousin, Bethany went to see Harry Potter, while Sharayah, Josh and Dustin and I stayed 'home'. Sharayah watched TV in the guestroom and Josh played computer. Dustin and I started watching "The Ring", but I fell asleep. When I woke up, it was time for worship practice. No one showed up though. :(  I was feeling really anxious to talk to a friend of mine. He's really making me mad right now, I just wish I knew what was going on. He didn't show up though. *sigh* What to do? *shrugs*  After chuch, Zach, Cynthia, Dustin, Josh, Bethany and I went out to eat at BK. It was nice. They freak me out sometimes though. We had some very interesting discussions..hahaha.  That's all.. Jama  While I read my Bible, I usually find verses that I REALLY like, so here is today's verse: "I will praise you as long as I live,  and in your name I will lift up my hands." Psalm 63:4

      It's been a few days since I last posted..sorry about that. I'm living a busy and crazy life..  I don't know what to do...there's several things going on with my friends. I love them all so dearly, but I just do not know what to believe anymore.  To my friends:  Don't be so hard on yourselves (heh, advice I need to take)...none of you are terrible people....in fact, you're lovely people, you both made mistakes, we all make mistakes. I don't hate either of you...I love you both. Please know that! :(  *sigh* I am so depressed.  -Jama

      So Max told us to go out and find something interesting. My camera isn't the best in the world, but here's what I got..     That little blurry thing on top of the grass is a bug. I actually layed on my stomach, and put my camera in the grass and took some pics. I found some very interesting bugs, one was gray and kinda looked like a lady bug. Another was one of those little "round" bugs..you know..they curl up into a ball when they feel like they're in trouble?  Moving on..I'm suprised I actually caught this. This is actually a little flower that's about the size of a lady bug. Like I said before, I don't have the best camera in the world, but here's a picture of it.     So after "digging" through the grass, I learned that there are SO MANY things that God has created, that we don't even SEE unless we dig through the dirt.  I managed to get this shot the other night..The sky looks really pretty, does it not?    So, an update on my life..? Life's been pretty good! I have some pictures from last night that I'll post in awhile.. :)  -Jama

      So today I actually went outside...scary huh? It's been a BEAUTIFUL day, and I thank God for days like these...they mean so much.  The 4th of July is one of my fave holidays..besides Christmas..    "Let me inside!"    Here's my sweetheart..    I LOVE this one..    Lastly..some flowers..     Tonight my friend Adrienne is having a b-day party for her sweet 16..I feel so bad because I don't think I'm going to make it. It's too far for us to travel (we go to church up there) and this last week has been terrible when it comes to gas..  I can't wait for tomorrow! -Jama

Everyone at church last night said, "I think we should test that!" :p Hah, very funny. *rolls eyes*  Anyways...that's all. :) -Jama

      I had a nice weekend! On Friday, my youth group went to the Zoo...that was fun! I have pictures, but I'll post them later.. haha. :)  I found out that these two little bumps on my hand are warts. WOOHOO! How fun! Hah! They don't even LOOK like warts, but they sure do hurt like crazy.  Well, I guess this isn't much of an update, but I am tired, and I'm feeling a bit depressed..  -Jama

      Currently Feeling: Sad.    I don't know what's wrong with me...I feel sad. Most of my friends are really disappointed in me. I keep making mistakes and I feel so terrible.  To make things worse...all of my friends are grabbing boyfriends...and I guess I feel jealous. I want to feel loved...but why do I feel like I need to be loved by a boyfriend? Why do I feel like that will "make things better"? See my friends, this is why I am always saying I am ugly...if there are no guys interested in me, then that means my personality sucks, or I am ugly...hah, probably both. *shrugs*  -Jama

      Well, it's been awhile, sadly since I've updated.   Currently, I am in a fight with one of my best friends. I am at the point right now that I just don't know what to believe anymore. I want to believe everything she's telling me...but....she's lied to me before about these types of things, so I'm not sure what to do.  But anyways, today has been super boring. I watched the first Jurassic Park film. I totally love that movie..I love all three movies, actually. I'd have to say my favorite is the third one. Lots of action..and it's cool.  I officially wish I wouldn't have cut my hair. I can't do  ANYTHING  with it. ARGH! Hopefully it'll be grown out by the Fall. :-p  Here's a picture of my cousins and I from Sunday.. :)     Sharayah, me in the middle, and Bethany  Well that's all...night.  Oh, BTW, I changed the layout if you hadn't noticed...haha. I got tired of the other one.

      I felt really loved when I read those comments two blog entries ago. Thanks you guys.   Thoughts   * Bryan- Actually, why  didn't  I tell you I had a blog? Hmm, maybe I just assumed you already had the link or something. *shrugs*  * Neo- Don't worry, I will NEVER ever wear immodest clothes..*shudders* I can't stand it.  I did learn, that I need to learn to love myself..and in the process, get closer to God. I believe that will help alot. It's just kind of hard, I guess..   So moving on.. I had a nice weekend. I decided to keep my dogs in my room on Saturday night..and boy oh boy..that was a bad idea. They were crying (wanted to go potty, and eat) at 3 in the morning. Grandma got up and let them outside, and gave them each a bone and stuck them back in my room. I woke up when she brought them back into my room, I was too tired to talk..but I wanted to say, "why did you give them each a bone??" See, my dog, Molly (my current picture that's by my profile ->>>) is..well..kind of mean. She always finishes her bone first because she has bigger and stronger teeth than Maggie. Sooo, Molly finished hers about 10 min. after she got it, and Maggie had barely started. Suprisingly, Molly fell asleep, and then so did Maggie. Half hour later, Molly wakes up. She sure can smell that bone, and she is HUNGRY. So Maggie wakes up, and you can tell Maggie is really sleepy, so she lays on top of that bone and tries to sleep. Now, you have to understand something....Molly gives death stares. I'm serious, she looks at Maggie and you can tell there is death in her eyes. Usually, Maggie starts growling, Molly shows her teeth at Maggie, Maggie growls some more, and then BOOM. They start fighting. And it isn't a playful fight...it's a "I'm going to KILL you" fight. I've gotten many, many scratches and bites from Molly trying to get Maggie away from her (Maggie's small...she can't fight back). Molly only growls and fights with Maggie though, she's never turned on us..thank God. If she did, grandpa would kick her out the door..seriously.  Well, that is all for now folks! -Jama

      I kept telling myself I was going to keep up w/ this blog, but so far I haven't done so well! These past few days have been wonderful. Last night was "backwards night" at youth. So we did everything backwards. PLUS- Tuesday was Jon's birthday so I embarressed him by making everyone sing to him. MUAHAHA! Evil of me, I know! Oh boy, I better be good cause' my birthday's coming up on the 24th of September. I can't believe I'm going to be 16...wow. In January I'll be able to actually drive with people in the car with me. Sweet. :)  Anyways, I spent the whole day w/ my lil cuz Sharayah yesterday and today. That twas fun and boring at the same time. The fun part was I beat her up. And the boring part was her beating me up. Good grief the child squished me this morning. :-p Then I squished her back..muahaha. Good times. On Sunday, my aunt Cathy is going to have Baby Jama over, so I get to help babysit her! (yes, there's a baby from our church named Jama, she's not really named after me..I mean, she is but she isn't, her dad also new a different Jama in highschool) She's SO adorable, I'll definately be getting some pictures of her. :)  I think Ady's staying the night w/ me tomorrow night! YAY! She's so cool. I think we're gonna ride bikes for most of the time, and maybe walk my dogs a little. Molly sure needs to. Sheesh, she's a big girl. :) And then on Saturday, it's Cowboy Church, so we'll be going to that. Can't wait. :)  I think that's all.. -Jama    Listening to:   TV   Song Currently Stuck in My Head:   "Strong Enough" - Stacie Orrico   Book I am Currently Reading:   "The Hangman's Curse" - Frank Peretti
