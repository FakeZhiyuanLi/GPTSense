        Gosh, I'm feeling snarky this evening. It's just past 11 p.m., and though I've been tired all day, I am nowhere near ready to go to bed and sleep. At the same time, I currently have the attention span of a gnat, so can't concentrate on any of my projects.  Like earlier today, I had suddenly gotten it into my head to reorganize and put into chronological order ALL of my family pictures that I had brought with me when I moved last year. What the hell prompted me to start that?! I don't know, but I managed to sort out a humongous stack of photos, which represents about half of the total, before I ran out of steam ... and I still have yet to ferret out the duplicates! D'oh! I'm just glad that what I have here is only a fraction of what it  could  be, considering the boxes and boxes of pictures that are in storage back in New Jersey.  Then there's this little seashell   urlLink  cross-stitch project   , which I started way back in January. I intended it to be a birthday gift for my grandmother, but didn't have it finished in time, so it's been languishing ever since. I started working on it again recently, because I really would like to have it done before I receive the order I placed with   urlLink  Nordic Needle    ... but it's sure not going to happen tonight! I just feel too fidgety.  I also got my PS2   urlLink  Killzone    beta-test kit today. Even though I don't really care for first person shooters (i.e., I really suck at them), it's always cool to be a beta-tester. I mean, you get to play a game that hasn't been released yet -- how sweet is that? And by so doing, hopefully have some input into the final version of the game. Just for example, I was a beta-tester for   urlLink  The Sims Online   , and that was truly a terrific, not to mention life-altering, experience. I met a lot of really interesting and fun people through TSO, including -- believe it or not -- my fiancé! So yeah, I'm geek enough to be all over a beta-test opportunity (at least in terms of gaming), but I can't quite muster up the desire right now to fire up the PS2 and see what   urlLink  Killzone    is all about.  And speaking of video games, I started a new one of   urlLink  Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland    yesterday. I still prefer the PSOne version of   urlLink  Harvest Moon: Back to Nature   , but I find both of them problematic in their own ways. BtN is definitely the superior game, in my considered opinion, due to it's surprising depth. But that is, unfortunately, also it's biggest drawback. StH for PS2 tries to address this by scaling the gameplay back in certain areas, but I feel that the result is that the game has lost a great deal of its heart. Streamlining doesn't have to mean simplifying. So while StH kept me occupied for a few hours yesterday, I'm not altogether certain I'll be continuing with it.  I'm just hoping that when   urlLink  The Sims 2    comes out next month, it'll be worth the  looooong  wait.  So where does that leave me? Antsy and gritty-eyed, and spending too much time browsing through blogs thanks to Blogger's new "Next Blog" button at the top of most pages.  (Please be advised that for the next section I am purposefully omitting any user names/IDs/weblog titles in order to protect the ignorant ... I mean, the innocent ...)  I really don't mean to be uncharitable, but sheesh! I have seen far too many blogs tonight written by junior high and high school students, most of them complaining about how much they hate school. Though the most memorable was a 9th-grade girl's blog, which consisted solely of I LOVE SO-AND-SO copied and pasted literally thousands of times. That's it. Okay, she did change the font color every couple hundred iterations, but I mean really! Doesn't she know what notebook paper is for? Only slightly above this level were the plethora of college students just starting their fall semester. They at least tend to stick to posting their class schedules (in order to bitch about the times), textbook titles and prices (to complain about  that ), and their homework/reading assignments (which of course is way too much).  Now I've done my share of pissing and moaning about everything school-related when I was in that situation, too, including that last go-round in college where I actually (mostly) enjoyed it. So I can pretty much forgive at least some of them. But then there are these other blogs, which are painfully badly written. I'm talking about a total and utter disregard for any conventions of grammar, spelling, punctuation, or for that matter, any semblance of coherency. Yes, I admit I am a bit of a snob when it comes to writing. And I fully acknowledge that I occasionally make typos and misspellings, that my grammar is not perfect, and that there are certain words I use far too frequently ... but I make the effort to write as well and as clearly as I can. I can't imagine that anyone can find a valid excuse for the butchery of the written word that permeates the 'Net   in spite of the fact that computer users have spelling and grammar checking tools at their very fingertips!!!   I do understand that the 'Net, particularly through the prevalence of IMing, has come to be a place for very informal communication. But what I have seen goes far beyond informality. This is one of my soapboxes issues, and as someone who once briefly considered becoming an English teacher, I would go so far as to say that it offends me on a very basic level.  Okay, I'm shaking it off, and am going to stop sniping now. I would just like to add that there was one blog I came across that really did grab me, and so I have added a link to it here. It's called   urlLink  MY WAR   ; the author,   urlLink  CBFTW   , is a soldier currently stationed in Iraq. It makes for some extremely interesting reading.  And that's it; I'm done. It is now well past midnight, so I am going to turn in and hope I can sleep, now that I've vented a bit.  P.S. -- Don't think for a moment that the irony escapes me that I spent a good portion of this post complaining about people complaining about stuff in their posts ... Isn't life just  delicious  at times? ;)

        Well, surprise me -- not! I kept up my blog for all of a week before I started to let the daily writing task slide. Grrr ... self-discipline has always been my primary stumbling block when it comes to writing. As I am currently unemployed, I can hardly claim that I am too busy. And I can't even legitimately say that I didn't have anything to write about recently; I fully intended to record the past weekend's activities, if nothing else. So while I can be extremely organized (read: anal-retentive) about some things, I tend to procrastinate terribly about others. It's an interesting mix, I suppose. What strikes me as ironic is that it's usually the activities I enjoy doing the most that I am the laziest about when it comes to actually making/taking the time to engage them!  So now that I've given myself a bit of a virtual verbal spanking, let me sum up what I had  meant  to write in the last few days. My fiancé, James, and I had a very enjoyable outing on Saturday: we toured the  urlLink U.S.S. Lexington . For those who don't know, the Lex is an aircraft carrier, one that was pivotal in the Pacific theater during World War II. It was decommissioned in the early 1990's, and reborn as a kind of floating museum, located here in Corpus Christi's harbor. Now, James is a real history/military buff, especially about WWII; he had visited the Lex several years ago and was eager to see it again, but thought I wouldn't be into it. Ha, ha -- fooled him! =:P I had a  great  time exploring the ship, and found the various displays quite interesting. I just wish we had gotten there earlier so we would have had more time. As it was, the three hours we had were not  quite  sufficient to tour the entire ship (we had to forgo the command tower), and we missed the IMAX movie. In spite of all the leg strain from climbing up and down the multitude of  very  narrow and tricky stairs -- not to mention the mental anguish, as I kind of have a phobia about stairs to begin with -- I would very much like to go back and see it all again, and especially catch the parts we missed this time around. Anyway, afterwards we enjoyed a truly excellent dinner at one of my favorite restaurants, Blackbeard's on the Beach, and then went for a leisurely drive along the bayfront. All in all, we had a very pleasant day, and it made for a nice change of pace to get out and do something different on the weekend.

        CNN.com - Julia Child dead at 91 - Aug 13, 2004  : "(CNN) -- Julia Child, who revolutionized cooking in the United States with her cooking school, cookbooks and television shows, has died, according to a statement from her publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. She was 91."    OK, I know the lady was old (and has come across as   ancient   for quite awhile now), but it still saddens me that she has passed. Obviously, I am too young to have experienced "The French Chef." But when "Baking with Julia" was on PBS during the mid-90's, I was right there every Saturday afternoon, watching even when it was a repeat. I also bought the book, and I have   never   purchased a $40 PBS-related book, before or since! I still miss that show, and was secretly hoping for a follow-up.

        CNN.com - New Jersey governor quits, comes out as gay - Aug 13, 2004  : "(CNN) -- Dropping a political bombshell, New Jersey Gov. James McGreevey announced his resignation Thursday after revealing that he is gay and that he had an adulterous affair with a man."    Wow. Heard about this last night, but still don't quite know what to make of it. As a former Jersey resident and half-hearted democrat, I was never that fond of McGreevey. But this is just one huge mess. Apparently, McGreevey was forced to go public because the guy with whom he had an affair was going to file sexual harassment charges against him; the why is unclear. But the waters get further muddied by the fact that McGreevey isn't resigning until mid-November, after elections, so that the Democrats will hold office till the end of his term. Like I said, a total mess. I just hope that whatever flak he receives, it will not focus so much on it having been a   homosexual   affair as on the fact that it was an   extra-marital   affair.

        Okay, I feel the need to haul out one of my soapboxes. Today's issue:  mosquitos . First, a little background. About a year ago, I moved here to Corpus Christi, Texas from southern New Jersey, where I had lived all my previous life. Now, we certainly have mosquitos in Jersey, and they can definitely be aggressively thick at times, but down here it's bloody (pun intended) ridiculous! I've always been the kind of person that mosquitos love (or hate, I'm not sure of  their  point of view); stick me in a group of people, and I'll get bitten ten times for every single bite the others individuals receive. Also, I develop these huge, quarter-sized raised welts that itch like a mad motherfucker; and after about three days, the bites start itching again! My ankles and feet are covered with scars from old bites, because I just can't stop myself from scratching myself raw and bloody. As you can see, I am more than justified in loathing these blood-sucking bitches. So what did I do? I moved to what must be the mosquito captial of the US, where batillions descend upon me the very instant I step outside. Brilliant! And this occurs virtually year-round! Now, most days I have an interior dialogue with myself, about how I should just resign myself to the situation, since pissing and moaning about it won't change it. However, there are some days -- like today -- where I just have to bitch. Why today? Well, for the first time in months it was actually cool this morning, cooler outside than it was in the house, in fact. Very pleasant. But did that keep the mosquitos at bay? Pshaw, don't be naive!  Anyway, my plight has led me to develop a theory. You know how, when kids reach a certain age, they start to find the prevalance of mall Santas a bit suspicious? And further, parents sometimes attempt to allay their kids' concerns by explaining that the Santa in the mall isn't the  real  Santa Claus -- of course not, ha ha -- but rather a man  who works for Santa ? After all, Santa is very busy, and it only makes sense that he has some assistance in taking care of all the children in the world. Well, I've come to believe that, in a similar fashion, mosquitos are the employees of Satan. Yep, they are the Devil's minions, hired to cultivate a persisent, low-level antagonism in their hapless victims, which over time, makes people more susceptible to commiting evil themselves. I know that, after a particularly bad mosquito attack, I am in a foul mood for the rest of the day, and would enjoy nothing more than to spread my pain and misery around to others. It's an insidious little plot, don't you think?  Oh well, on to other matters ... I like to give a shout out to   urlLink  Queenie   , with enormous, candy-coated thanks for being the first visitor to my blog to post a comment. It totally made my day, and yes, I suppose that does mean I am easy. But not cheap! Of course, I immediately went to her blog and took a browse around. I was so impressed, I added a link to her blog   urlLink  THE BUS "Tales from the 2A Dundas"    to my sidebar here. It's a form of observational journal-writing that has been elevated to the next level. As she rides the bus to and from school, she people-watches, observing and imagining about the other riders on the bus. From what she takes in, she creates these unique musings about these strangers that are almost like short short-stories. Very absorbing.

        I've been investigating this site, and I can't quite figure out how people are supposed to find particular blogs or bloggers. From the Dashboard, all that's available is the (quite lame and out-of-date) Blogs of Note and the Recently Updated. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there doesn't seem to be a main page from which one can search or browse categories. The only other method I have found is to view my own profile and click on the links for stuff I listed as interests or favorites; that'll then produce a list of other bloggers who listed the same item, and then you can go to their profile, and from there to their blogs. Doesn't that seem a little convoluted and counter-intuitive? What if I'm looking for something that I haven't listed as one of my interests or favorites? How about something topical, news-related? It's no wonder so many of the other blogs that I have looked at have posts without any comments. I'm at a bit of a loss ...

        Here's an interesting little bit-o-fun I stumbled across today:  urlLink SpaceFem  has some time-wasters (i.e., quizzes) on her site, and I just took the Militant Feminist Quiz. Here are my results:   ___________________________________________    urlLink      I'm getting there.  I don't suck, but I've got a ways to go.    ___________________________________________    Make of that what you will ... Anyway, I also took her Geek Time quiz, and apparently I am a 1970's geek. Um, not quite sure what that means, but there you have it.    Speaking of Internet quizzes, I always enjoy the time I waste over at  urlLink Tickle , formerly eMode. Frankly, the site was way better when it  was  eMode, before Tickle came along and added all the bullshit with the personals. I was happy with just the tests, what did they need to go and attatch "matchmaking and social networking"?! I guess there just aren't enough websites for such things. What  ever   ...    I also came across a virtual pet adoption link on  urlLink Resevoir Kitten's blog  over at  urlLink tBlog . Scroll down the sidebar to see this blog's new mascot, Killer, the White Rabbit. BTW, when you click on him, he jumps! W00t! If you'd like a virtual pet for your own web page, go to  urlLink Bunnyhero Lab's Adoption Centre . In addition to rabbits, they have puppies, kittens, ducks, and penguins. Also dragons, "coming soon."  And lastly, thanks to  urlLink MyCartoonDolls  for providing "adoptable" avatars; I chose one for this site from their Irish Eyes collection.

              I spent some time earlier today figuring out how to get a links section to appear on my blog's sidebar (this template did not have one embedded in the script). It's been awhile since I last used HTML, and most of the very little bit I had learned, I have since forgotten. So the process was a bit frustrating; I won't even go into the trouble I encountered when I tried to change the template to something I had found and downloaded from elsewhere! Regardless, I did accomplish this one small achievement, and so thought I would give a bit of explanation for the links I have posted.   urlLink My Yahoo! LAUNCHcast station  -- Hopefully, this is self-explanatory. I would like to add, though, that for a free service (I have not upgraded from the basic to Plus, and so far see no need to), it does a very good job of playing stuff that I like based on the stuff I have rated. Also, there really is a good and fairly extensive selection of music from all different genres.   urlLink ThooLou's Lair  -- This is my fiancé's weblog. Here you will primarily find topical and political discussions, as well as recommendations for interesting and ecclectic stuff he has come across on the 'Net. If you enjoy participating in spirited discussions, you should check it out.   urlLink Red Vs. Blue  -- Absolutely hysterical, episodic machinima using the PC game Halo as its basis. The guys who write, voice act, and produce this stuff are indisputably creative geniuses. I would compare the storyline and humor of Red Vs. Blue to such professional amusements as Family Guy and South Park. Rooster Teeth Productions: A true web phenomenon.   urlLink Albino Blacksheep  -- People submit oddities they find on the web to this site. Content varies widely, but a lot of stuff is there because it is funny in some way. Some stuff is just plain strange. Other things are not meant to be funny or weird, and are simply posted because they are interesting creations. This is where I have discovered two of my enduring favorite files:  urlLink The Dildo Song  and  urlLink The Smurfs Lost Episode . I can't really describe the site better, you should take some time to investigate it yourself.   urlLink OddTodd  -- If you have ever been unemployed for an extended period of time, particularly if it was through no fault of your own (i.e., the dreaded downsizing), then you can find the humor in your plight here. It's fun and games for the SSUP (Secret Society of Unemployed People) in LOL (Laid-Off Land)!   urlLink Joe Cartoon  -- Another brilliant, creative, and funny site with loads of flash cartoons. In particular, check out the Stone Fly series. Priceless!  And BTW, if you know of any other eclectic sites where funny and/or unusual web entertainment can be found, please pass it on here!

        Hi, there! I finally decided to start my own blog, and since this is my first post, I probably won't be saying anything too extraordinarily interesting today. But let me briefly share with you some of the nebulous ideas I have had as to what my web log may encompass.    I know that many bloggers use their pages as a forum for their own thoughts on current events, politics, and the like, and in so doing, cultivate discussions on those topics among their readers. I suspect there will be some of that here as well (or at least the first part, 'cause that's  my  task here). Now, do I really need my very own personal soapbox? Hmm, well, I don't believe there are a  great  number of issues that easily trigger rant-mode with me, but there are certainly a few that do set me to frothing at the mouth, and assist me in attaining a certain stridency of voice. So I think it is somewhat comforting to know that I have an outlet to go to when such topics arise. I assume there will also be some of the requisite journal-type entries  , day-to-day stuff, observations, musings, and what not. All of this seems pretty standard of the typical blog.    But what I'd really like to see my blog evolve towards is a kind of catch-all for any writing that I'd like to do. If I get some response (or at least, some  traffic , which I realize will take awhile), I'd like to post some fiction, including short-stories and possibly some poetry. The thought of doing so makes me a bit nervous, as it has been a long time since I seriously sat down to write, just for the sheer pleasure of the act, and the art, of writing. The satisfaction of creating something unique is a sensation I long to recapture. And I thought that this medium may help me down that path, so here we are!    In closing for today, I would like to thank you for dropping by and reading my post(s). Please always feel free   to post any of your own comments or feedback, and   I hope y  ou will retur  n to read more!
