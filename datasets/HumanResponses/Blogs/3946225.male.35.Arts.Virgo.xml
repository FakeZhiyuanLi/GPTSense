      One by one… Things I thought only I can manage, people I thought I have to have to complete my life.   It was hard when I thought about letting it go, but by the time I realized that I am actually doing this, I became very calm and very subjective.  It wasn’t about giving up. I’m just waving white flag for agony in my heart.   I will think about those I let go every second I breath, but I will think them without dark clouds in my mind.

      Is there such a thing as “rather not know for them”? We say to people that be earnest, but it’s more about be earnest for&nbsp;ourselves then what you care about others. Just feel good about ourselves that you did the right thing. Nothing about how much you care about what other feel or think just to pat my own back.

      When I send an e-mail, Is it little of me to think that I will get a reply?  Ever since e-mail becomes part of our lives, communication became worsen as far as I concern. Because of the benefit of e-mail which is you don’t talk face to face that you can ignore without feeling guilty. Also they get emotional through e-mail. They fall in love through e-mail they get angry through e-mail but is it really reaction from the e-mails or you are reacting to your own emotion which &nbsp;it’s nothing to do with what it says on the e-mail you are reading.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      All my life, I have been explained myself..... my odd personality, what I like, why am I doing.....  &nbsp;  I'm tired to explain  &nbsp;  I have been trained myself whole my life to find reasons for my act and I always&nbsp;prepare&nbsp;to answer without understanding I don't need to explain.  &nbsp;  Guess what?  &nbsp;  it's who I am, and I don't even know answer for myself most of time. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now  &nbsp;  I 'm gonna put my trail of thought here so that I will tell people to come here for the answers they are dying to know. Even thought most of things I will put up here&nbsp;are not going to be answers but maybe this will help what triggered me to think certain way.

      Now  It happened. When you least expected.  It happened worst way…… Money.  To me it’s not about the money the way he handles it which I don’t think he understand.  Worst part of all this is that it doesn’t bothers me much. Sure I have some feeling toward this but it was not big enough to affect either my work performance or my personal life.  Just sad that it had to be end this way.  I’m trying to deal with this adult way. I hope I did the right

      When I start to let it go - whatever “it” may be – I didn’t expect that I need to let go of my friends. But it was clear that it’s time to let this go too.  I have a choice that either I accept the way it is or I refuse to feel bad about myself.  I know what I’m going to do………….  Just one thing I’m wondering is that should I initiate the closing or just go on with life and let the time tell that it is over?
