      Well, here it is Friday and I've been horribly unemployed for a week and a half now.  The money is gone ... and Karen and I are needing a good bit of money for the security deposit on our new apartment.  I also need to round up $200. for car insurance.  Not to mention that I need to pay $325. for rent on my old place......all by the first of the month. What do I do?  I was hoping that someone else would have the answer to that question, as I don't... I already have a loan out from my parents and a friend of mine.... and Karen can't afford to support me too... (not that I want her to, but she offers out of the kindness of her heart)(I've a very lucky person)...  Any suggestions would be good......

      It's the middle of a warehouse. The camera (you) is in the middle of the warehouse and is panning around to a set of doors. The doors open and I step through. As I walk towards you (not seeing you ofcourse, you're not  really   there) you can hear my footsteps echo off the bare walls.  I finally reach your position. Scratching my chin, I look around and say "So....This is a Blog".  Hi, I'm Russ. I'll be your narrator for this speedy but unusual trip through my life. I'll be posting my thoughts, feelings, and a good dose of humor here, so stick around. If you're offended easily, you may want to skip over some of this stuff... You'll be able to tell when I'm just having a bad day and when I'm really being malicious. Besides, it's all in fun anyway.  Let me tell you a bit about myself. My name is Russell Swinnerton. I live in Hummelstown, PA with my girlfriend (We'll call her Karen), and her daughter. It's not a bad little town... couple of pizza joints, a Sheetz, and a bar or two (is there much else to life??). I love my girlfriend and her daughter very much and they are the most important people in my life. Coming right along side them are my parents (We'll call them Mike and Linda) and my closest sister (Vicki, is her name). Right behind them are all my friends. Timmy, Dan, Dan, Dan (there really are 3 different Dans), Steve, Steve (and a collection of Steves), Kelly, Amanda, George, Brian, Rick, Kendra, Chris, Mark, MaryBeth, Rocky, Dave, and some others I don't see too much.  I've got to go now, but I'll update you on what I like to do later, OK? Enjoy the Blog. Russ
