      Yes, today the Hutton report was published.  Bit of an anticlimax, really.  I was more concerned about Colin foolishly leaving his condoms at home resulting in a disappointing lack of sex today.  Oh well.  It also snowed.  For about five minutes.   Buuuut it pleased the boy goon, so I suppose that's a plus.  However, I may end up walking him to school tomorrow as a result, which is a bit of a bummer. Ah well, will attempt to be a little more regular and interesting with my postings now.  Just thought I'd let you know I'm alive.

      Woo, how thrilling, I have a blog.  But bugger all to write in it.  Oh well,  I'll think of something, I daresay. Here starts a new era...

      Gosh, I've been a busy little bee!  The lovely Colin took me out for a meal at the Harvester on Saturday night for Valentine's day, along with his brother Paul and his girlfriend/my friend Chaz.  Much fun was had.  I ate far too much, got a little tipsy too, then we all came back to my house and slept (eventually). No rudeness!!  Anyway, here's some pics:   You can just about make me out in this one, grabbing my chest   Chaz and Paul, drunk as skunks   He'll hate me for putting this up, but this is Colin wearing my bra...   Awww, bless, I don't even remember this one being taken but it's cute!   Colin, Chaz and Paul   This one's just far too funny not to post, doesn't look at all suspicious does it? Then on Sunday evening I went to see  urlLink A Profound Reason  (band with Colin, Jamie etc. in) in a Battle of the Bands at the Adge, along with Julie and some other friends.  They didn't get through, but rocked mightily, the crowd loved them and they got a lot of requests for CD's etc (alas, they haven't got round to recording one yet... they've only been together 2 months!).  Got drunk  again , was very soppy with Colin, then Julie came back to mine and we attempted to sleep.  Bah.  So today I'm absolutely knackered, but have still managed to update  urlLink www.useful-idiot.cjb.net .  Have a look.  Bye all xxx

      Well, it rocked, to cut a long story short!  A couple of days beforehand I got a letter from Longacres confirming their job offer (so I duly accepted) so I'm finally not quite so skint (or I won't be when I get paid next Thursday).  Friday I went shopping in Guildford, picking up some fecking great bargains.  Mainly clothes, which I'd be getting as presents the next day.  Speaking of which, Saturday was my 17th!!  Absolutely fantabulous.  Gran, Papa, Phil, Mike, Maria and Alana came round for tea and cake, and I got my clothes (pretty purple dress, black bustier, silver corsetty-type jobby, purple 3/4 sleeve top and a black skirt, I think it's called a drindle or something), also a case for my camera, beaded curtain, and great big fluffy cushion and some fluffy heart lights.    This is Alana and JP on the aforementioned cushion.  Bless!!  Then an hour or so later my friends started to arrive for the big party.  Julie and Stew turned up first, literally as I'd just pulled my dress on.   Julie and Stew (well, Julie's arse at least, but it's a nice one!)  Theeen it was Colin, Paul and Jamie, followed shortly by Chaz, so we could get started!  This was taken before we got pissed, indicated by the fact there aren't CD's strewn all over the place.  However, Julie does appear to be stroking Jamie's foot in a strange fashion, but that's just her.  Speaking of Julie, she gave me a very nice willie keyring, which I would put pictures of up if they weren't a little on the rude side.  Anyway, here's me in my purple dress:    The flushed face, exposed cleavage and inability to balance can be put down to the bottle in my hand.  More drinking led to this:    Yep, that's me in the background, my tit covered only by a large, cunningly placed red cross.  I haven't yet mentioned my lovely balloons, mainly because I neglected to take a picture before all the helium was inhaled (leading to hilarious renditions of "Follow the Yellow Brick Road"), but you can see them in the background of this picture of Paul and Chaz:    She'll probably kill me for putting such an unflattering picture of her on here, but... oh well.  Most of the events of that evening are a bit of a blur, but highlights included me burning the pizza because I was too out of it to remember how to work the oven, Jamie conducting a loud phone conversation outside my parents' bedroom door about what nymphomaniacs me and Colin are, the traffic cone from my back garden mysteriously appearing in the middle of the floor, me and Colin declaring our undying love for each other (we didn't even need to be drunk, bless), Julie stumbling round at 4 in the morning trying to find her glasses (and waking us up!) and the zip for my dress being broken.    Shit photo, but it gives an interesting clue as to how my zip went.  Anyway, we eventually all fell into a drunken stupor and awoke early the next morning to find... SNOW!!  Some of us didn't much fancy getting up...    Buuuut eventually childish excitement took over and here's the pics:   Colin, Julie (well, part of her), Paul and Jamie.    Awww, Colin!  I'm having this as my wallpaper when I get my new PC.    Me, ever the poser, looking very fetching in mum's coat    Cheer up, it's snowing!!  Foolish chaps with no coats, eh?    Yay, happy dance!!    And that's it for birthdayness, I think.  I spent Sunday hung over, Monday I went to pick up my new crash (17" Sabian AAX Dark Crash, yum) from Drumwright and buy stands for the ride and china Jamie's planning to sell me, then put up the feathery curtain I got from Paul and Chaz and the fluffy heart lights.  Tuesday... oh yeah, I tidied up a bit and Colin came round.  I also gave my beddy bear (it's a lavender-scented bear you warm in the microwave, pressie from Col) a test run, slept like a log!  Yesterday I started work, all very thrilling, although I did turn up half an hour early due to dad's nerves.  Disappointingly I didn't go today, but went to the doctors about this blasted cold I've had for weeks, then snuggled up in bed again. So, that's the thrills and spills of birthday week!

      Don't really feel like posting today, but here I go anyway.  Colin came round this morning (there's a shock), which was good as he was there to give me hugs etc. when I started crying.  Buuuut he had to leave at lunchtime so the afternoon was spent painting, crying, and crying on my painting.  Argh. SO I've had a headfuck of a day, really. On a lighter note, here's an animation I made a couple of days ago.  I don't think it needs subtitling.    Hopefully I'll have cheered up and pulled myself together by tomorrow. xL

      Well, I was supposed to go to Guildford today with Colin, alas the train was cancelled so we stayed in Camberley.  Spent too much as usual, stuff included various paint, brushes (to be fair I do need it, but it still hurts my wallet).  Got my new tops through the post.    Here's one, pics of the other two will follow when my face is not smeared with a huge quantity of black eyeliner (had one of my moods earlier, don't ask).  Oh, also got a rather snazzy penknife, as I got fed up with sharpening my pencils with mediocre sharpeners.  Mum's ordered some boots for me too, which should come in the next few days.  Um... oh yeah, I've added my imood indicator to the sidebar.  Think that's all to report. Hugs, xL

      Firstly, I've added a message board so I can get some feedback on the crap I post here, it's linked over on the left  Secondly, I've done some more online tests, surprising how accurate some of them are (I won't say which, you'll have to guess)      I AM 42% TORTURED ARTIST!

      Changed the blog skin, and activated comments on posts so I can get rid of the crappy messageboard.  The links have gone, mainly because I'm crap with css so I couldn't figure out how to put them back properly. So, news... have had to give up work (well, I gave up whether or not I had to).  Back to my usual slacking self *sigh*.  Have gone on the pill, which is fecking great, Colin and I are VERY happy.  Twas a year since we met on Sunday.   urlLink APR  gig the other night was fab.  Pissed off because  urlLink 8th House  have found a drummer just as I was beginning to bring Colin round to the idea.  Bollocks.  Actually, I'm pretty miserable anyway, my skin's being a bitch thanks to the heat, but I can't really complain.  OK, I can, but I'll try not to.  Need to have a good think and sort my life out (again). Anyway, not much else to report. xL
