      (i apologize. written in haste. no capitalization.)  see the problem here is that mine was funny, and yours was a conservative libertarian party diatribe.   so lets be not funny:  environment. the federal government has a lot of right to get involved in 'state concerns'. state a says eleventy-billion tons of toxic fumes released a year is no problem. state b says they only want to allow 5 million tons. thankfully for state a, state b is situated downwind. now state b still has the right to sue state a, but the toxic inflow is already over and done with. there should have been federal law ahead of time.  public education is a mess. but what bush has done is not making it better. what we teach kids is to be excellent subordinates. even most private schools do this. and the massive privatization initiative at hand is mostly from supporters of specific industries. this would make the children not only prepared to be excellent subordinates, but to have specific affiliation. also certain information would be censored if it did not show the school's largest supporters in a good light. when someone proposes an unaffiliated privatized school system that has structure which allows students of all backgrounds to receive the education of their choice then you've got something. education is my largest stray from the envirolibertarian platform.  this terror argument you have is utter dogshit. the 'we are safer at home' argument can be summed up as follows: we were being terrorized by a bunch of religious nutbags who have trouble distinguishing between military and civilians, between americans who want them to have better lives and between americans who wish they would all kill themselves or become christian or something. they attack us where we live. this sucks so we figure if we station a bunch of poor people under our affiliation near where they live they will focus their resources where it is easiest to strike. it works. victory. we are now safer at home. this is definitely your weakest argument among all of them. are you proposing that under the carter administration our national security was strong simply because there was no terrorist attack on US soil? my advice is that you adhere closer to the current libertarian platform on this. iraq made no sense. and those who defend it are applying something called 'interminable justification'. i.e. give reasons a, b, c, d, e, and f (all at different times) for carrying out event 1. carry out event 1. find all previously stated reasons to be false. create reason g. insist reason g was the most important reason all along. find reason g to be false. create reason h. repeat as long as needed. you can see this clearly in those who still hold that every last word in the bible is factual and never poetic, exaggerated, or just made up. that 'the bible is factual' holds firm, the actual meaning of certain sections of the text can be manipulated or whatever is needed to maintain this primary position. it's antiscience and it's silly.  pure capitalism has never been tried and never will be because everyone who lives in reality knows the dangerous repercussions it would have. this is also why true communism was never tried. that shit is scary, and would probably create inequalities never dreamed of. but capitalism in any form (restricted to any degree) has this bad habit of rewarding many who don't deserve it, and not rewarding many who do. now be careful here, i am not saying that capitalism only rewards people who don't deserve it. many many people create something very valuable to society and are rewarded wonderfully. many others don't do a lick of work and are impoverished as a result. but a large level of injustice abounds. people work very hard for 60 hours a week and can barely survive. others inherit huge amounts of money and continue earning only through investment, meanwhile they do nothing of import save for have their money work for them. they work hard at their golf game. capitalism is not god, and will not save all our problems if we would only just let it do what it is supposed to. with mindnumbing serendipitous exceptions (professional athletes, actors, lottery winners, &c.), it constantly takes power away from those who already didn't have much and directs it to the already powerful. the moment we find a system that replaces greed with vision as the impetus for new discovery is the moment we have a working and sustainable one. it is important that we find a way to keep others from making bad decisions that takes government out of the equation whenever possible. but this can't happen until we have a means of conveying information to massive amounts of people without stepping on some multi-billionaire's toes. wow there are so many directions i can keep going with this involving economies of sale and localized resources allowing for minimized government interaction on and on. just know that forgetting all the large-scale vocabulary concerning economies...i am fairly certain that we both want pretty much the same thing here: a place where innovation and hard work is always rewarded. a place where laziness and ill-will are always not rewarded. where i don't know if you step into line with me is the main change i would like to make in this world. which is to dismantle the current corporate structure and require that anyone who holds share in a venture is socially liable for the damage that venture may inflict upon society. not just their money is accountable, their whole person. in the court of law. this will make people be more responsible for their own actions (investments) which i would say is a sign of decency. thus we will avoid little mix-ups like ddt devastation. or if they still happen we can rest assured that those who profited from its creation are not merely bankrupt (which rarely happens in our current system), but also securely behind bars (which never happens in our current system).   each paragraph seems to be getting longer than the one before it so i will make the next two brief and then perorate...  destroying a zygote is not the same as killing another person. abortion is never desirable. calling these people pro-abortion is vitriol. they don't find out there were 116 abortions today and start thanking mother moon and then hope for more abortions tomorrow in the hopes that we may someday break a million! here is a libertarian idea for you: freedom ceases to be complete the moment a woman's body is controlled by the state. what about the freedom of the child to live you say? is it a child? this is too ambiguous. what we should be having is a national debate concerning when a fetus is a fetus and when it is a child. my vote is for when their is brain activity. some people may have other opinions (like the moment the ovum becomes a zygote). but this one has little scientific merit.  why do gay people want to get married? the solution here is to take away any of these incentives that there are to be married. they were to encourage people to have lots of children. we don't need that anymore.  conclusion: i want to dismantle government power just as much as the next guy. i want to only pay a small percentage of taxes. i want that percentage to not change no matter how much i make. and i want to be able to decide to what specific government programs my tax money will go toward. i want people to see someone who takes in excessive amounts of money and say "now there's a drain on society" or "wow, that asshole is really overvaluing herself!" i think kerry really sucks. he says what he thinks people want him to say and he is afraid to say things that need to be said. he's just boring. i probably won't vote for him. but bush is living in a dream world. "i talk to god, he tells me what to do. i am a war president. i am a peace president. john kerry is a flip-flopper. all poor people are lazy. evidence will never be as important as determination. they hate us because we are free. i am the president and i don't have to justify anything, other people might have to justify something to me, but i never have to explain any of my actions if i don't want to. is our children learning?"*  mr. president, i have just two questions for you. (1) do you think it is possible that you are isolating yourself from any ideas contrary to your own? (2) your candle is burning brightly!   in a way, my solutions would probably fall on more attentive ears if we have another decade or so of these "compassionate conservatives".  i am starting to think that if bush can squeeze out a win here it might be better for everyone twenty-five years from now or so. pressure makes change, and kerry is scary because he will take a little bit of relief off some of the poor and disenfranchised, the people who don't vote because they can feel what i'm saying, they can sense the injustice is all around them, but they just can't put their finger on the problem. and they know JFKII is not the solution.  fin.      *note: for those who would take great offense if this footnote were absent...all bush quotes are paraphrased and were not said in succession as the quotation marks imply.

      "Why I am voting for George W. Bush in November 2004.  I am voting for G.W.B., but not because of his policies concerning the environment. I feel that the Federal government has no business whatsoever getting involved in its states' environmental issues. If G.W.B. wants to clean up Washington D.C. that's fine with me, but I take issue when the Federal government sticks its nose in matters that are obviously better handled by a local, accessible governing force.  I am voting for G.W.B., but not because of his education initiatives. Public schools are even more obviously a state matter. Any monetary or regulatory control by a distant Federal government blind to local issues can only make things worse.  I am voting for G.W.B., but not because he is fighting a noble war on terror. Rather, because he is doing an effective job of protecting our national security. While the desire to carry out terrorist attacks on the U.S. has presumably been increased by our war in Iraq, one can't argue the fact that we have not had such an attack since 9/11/2001.  I am voting for G.W.B., but not because of his schemes to redirect our economy. Why does the Federal government feel that any scheme can do a better job at regulating the economy than competition? Capitalism can take care of itself.  I am voting for G.W.B., but not because of his stance on abortion. His zealous defense of the unborn child is only getting in the way of medical and social progress. If pro-abortionists would concede that destroying a developing child is no different from destroying any other person I would count myself among them. There is no question that there are times when one must kill for certain good reasons, like saving the life of a mother, allowing a raped woman not to bear her rapists child, preventing a child from having to live with birth defects, or saving the lives of countless other people. We already have legislated "acceptable" cases of this, like capital punishment.  I am voting for G.W.B., but not because of his views on gay marriage. Why the government ever had ANYTHING to do with such an important religious observation is beyond me. Let's remove all legislative and governmental references to marriage and we'll have a non-issue. If people want a legal, contractual obligation to each other regarding taxes, mutual possessions, medical authority, or any other implied marital right, let them sign a contract.  The reason I am voting for G.W.B. this election year is to avoid the alternative. While it appears that our country may ultimately become a socialist nation, I personally want to delay that as long as possible. And while one can argue that Republicans and Democrats really aren't all that different in practice, Republicans are the lesser of two evils when it comes to reducing the role of the Federal Government. The pervasive "what can my country do for me" attitude in America -- which is parroted by Kerry -- undermines some of our most important values: personal accountability, rugged individualism, and reward for hard work. What a tragedy it would be if we allowed petty fads and societal pressures to divide and destroy the best governmental system ever devised."  --Andxew Jaxes Xarson (x's and r's were added in a non-random way in order to conceal [his/her/the transgender person's] identity)

      Why I am voting for George W. Bush in November 2004…  I am voting for G.W.B., but not because of his policies concerning the environment. His solution to new-growth forest fires is to let loggers run rampant in National Park old-growth areas. He ignores the warnings of 99.9% of scientists, that greenhouse effects are magnified drastically by carbon emissions, in order to placate archaic industrialists.  I am voting for G.W.B., but not because of his education initiatives. Making standardized testing the empyreal measuring device for knowledge accrued eliminates imagination to make way for inculcation and obviates diversity to maximize memorization of easily-researched datum.  I am voting for G.W.B., but not because he is fighting a noble war on terror. Unilateral preemptive aggression is the most efficacious way to breed tens of thousands of next-generation Osamas. Framing those who seek to do us harm in such binary nomenclature as ‘evil’ or ‘soulless’ only widens the chasm that peace must bridge.  I am voting for G.W.B., but not because of his schemes to redirect our economy. In college our president was known to believe that poor people were such because they have no desire to work—and he has given us little to think that his opinion has altered. Even supply-side economists are unsettled by his egregious disregard for balanced budgets as well as the fluxing nature of investment whereby more and more money gained from tax cuts is reinvested in foreign ventures.  I am voting for G.W.B., but not because of his stance on abortion. He makes bold proclamations about the ambiguous ‘beginning of life’ without offering an alternate solution to the original catastrophe to which legal abortion was the constitutional resolution. He seems more interested in preserving zygotic mitosis than providing basic medical services for 44 million children or finding cures for the geriatric—both of whose scientific status as ‘life’ requires no debate.  The reason I am voting for G.W.B. this election year is because of his deep relationship with Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. It is important to understand that, because Heaven is a place of infinite joy, by extension any place that is not Heaven may as well be Hell. Thus it is with this that I question every effort made toward so-called ‘progress’ here on Earth. Thinking logically about the mathematical abstract of infinite comparison, the Law of the Excluded Middle provides this immediate conclusive truism: despite how much better things seem to be getting, we still may as well be in Hell.  It is with this that I support the most expedient return possible to the cultural consensus of willful ignorance—a golden era of which we have not seen since the coming of the viral Renaissance. A return to darker times would make life on Earth more in tune with the Hell that it is in reality, and will drive those living upon it to hone their focus on that life which is of infinite more import: the afterlife. For if one calls a turd a rose, one may be satisfied with their ‘rose’ instead of seeking out the quintessential beauty of authenticity. G.W.B. stands poised as the best man for the job of turning the paradigm of progress on its head (where it belongs). He has the courage to create the Hell on Earth necessary for maximizing the redemption of its sinners!
