      Lemme start my blog off with promotions and demotions:  Pooj has been promoted to a 90/100  Clare has been demoted to an 85/100....and its going down the further i get pissed off and it won't go bck up until she talks to me. Well, she is talking to me, but im the one who has to call her or say hi on MSN first, its always been like that and to be honest im getting pretty sick of it.   Also, the other reason is because she trusts Loz with serious stuff more than me.  This frustrates me.  She likes the lezbian, who the other day, I ask "Why is clare annoyed with me" because no one else would tell me because it waas a secret she said "srry i can't tell" then I go "ohhhh, come on:(" then she tells me:@:@  Tres triple merde and tres irritante  by the way, since we've been talking its nw gone donw to a 84/100  Ciao! Mel

PISSED OFF. Just found out that Charlo and Luke smith are going on a "date" and her mum and dad don't know, and she told everyone (not including me, because ofcourse i don't count) not to pick up the phone incase they ask where she is. But she never told MEEEEE that.  Oh what is wrong with me?  This is the happs. One of my "best friends" asked out my Ex, whom I dumped. even though she never told me until about one month later. Thanks. On one side I couldn't give a shit. But on the other I'm so jelous I could pop. So That leave me in the pissed off mode. Well not really with her, Infact I am, only, not really  I don't know!  But Im just pissed off with everything that moves.  Mel

      I miss Max. Stupid Ginger Pubes. Why did you have to move away to your 2.3 million pound house in aston. Lucky bastard. I would give almost ANYTHING to be  millionaire......      But I'd give more than anything to be with you Maxie.  It saddens me so to know i'll never see you again :'(     Oh lookie, another reason to put on the list why I hate my life.    Now lets see.....  I hate my live because....  Danny is in it I never ever have a frend who I can REALLY count on Im such a bitch I have no girls to talk to at home. Except my mum, but she dont count. Because i inherited my bitchiness from her. Soraya and my dad are Sick. Michael gets everything he wants. My parents are so over protective. I can't be trusted by anyone. No one tells me secrets. Im so damn ugly. and the ratio to people who think im pretty is 1:100000000000000000000000 Max has gone bye bye.  I love my life because.....  *Tumble weed floats by**  **followed by a few cricket sounds**   Maxie, if your reading this plz come back to me.....  Why do I love Max? He's so depressing.... But he's got lovely eyes.... Just like Jeremy! **drool** Jeremyyyyyyyyy......  Ciao 4 now! Mel XxX

      Last night I slept outside on my balcony.I love doing that, it's so pieceful and relaxing. Any I was sleeping outside, looking down on my garden, whilst tring to concer my fear of heights and thinking:      WTF IS EVERYONES PROBLEM?       I'm now going to be incredibly bitchy and write down what I think of them and give them a score out of 100 (Im being incredibly harsh with the scoring, It's just cos im in a bitchy mood:D). The scoring goes as:  0/100=COULDN'T HATE THEM MORE 1-10/100=Hate them 10-25=Dislike them VERY VERY MUCH 25-50=dislike them 50/100=Don't like 'em, don't hate 'em 51-60=Pissed off with them 60-80= would count them as a good friend 80-90=A very good Friend, one of my best 90-99=some ones who stuck by me thru evrything 100=The best friend I ever had.   Starting with the ladies and the first up in alphabetical order is.....  Clare- I do like her, but the little things piss me off. Like the other day, I ask her to my house and she goes "Srry, busy." C'est N'ai Pas Amical! And the way, she always tells me she has boy trouble, but she won't tell me what it is. She's so secretive, even though I tell her eveything. It really upsets me the way She dosen't trust me the way I trust her.      Even though I trusted Paul at one time.     Score on how much I like them: 90/100  Pooj-I do like pooj, she's good to talk to and to be honest, shes always been good to me. But I could never be her best mate, her Idea of "Fun" Is walking round with Jools and staring at 6th formers. **cough cough** BORING      Score on how much I like them: 75/100  Loz: Now, theres an interesting thing with Loz, sometimes she acts like a Lezbian. Like she NEVER tells you who she fancies, which means it's hard to know if she has ever fancied anyone, She is against any piercings (including ears)because it looks "slutty" But that mean that nearly every girl, from the age 1- about 100 are sluts. Also., her hair is SUPER SUPER culry and she refuses to straighten it. But she's ok i guess. Shes rlly pissed off with me at the moment. But I couldn't care less:D   Score on how much I like them:70/100  Ria: Is HILARIOUS whats hses hyper, But Im afraid I only found out, a couple of weeks ago she didn't realy count me as a friend.   Score on how much I like them: 70/100  Jools: Heres an interesting specimin. Acting like shes my best mate, then slagging off me and my other mates behind my back, I think you know what score SHE gets   Score on how much I like them: 50/100  Lucy: Sorry, Lu, can't call you Chloe anymore, because apparently it "pisses" off some people:@   Score on how much I like them: 90/100   Ira: I've always liked her, she helps me with my homework:D   Score on how much I like them:90/100  Charlo: I like her alot, but when she don't like you, lol, she lests you know about it. She is nice to me now, but before shes been so nasty to me.    Score on how much I like them:90/100    Amy: Shes always stuck by me, never once been bitchy and kept every one of my secreats I've told her. She couldn;t be a nicer person   Score on how much I like them:100/100  Alice: I like her, but sometimes shes a bit demanding and bitchy, but very very pleasent person to be with.   Score on how much I like them:85/100  Nisha: Same with Ira, I've always liked her, she helps me with my homework:D   Score on how much I like them:90/100  Rachel: Even though she can be a bit bostrous, and she told one of my really important secreats to some people, even though it was out of the kindness of her heart. It wasn;t good:. But I still really really like her:d   Score on how much I like them:90/100  Thats all the girls, i'll change it probs when we fall out... again  I think most of them will like those scores:D  Thankgod they aren't here, or my head will be on the chop!  Ciao 4 now! Mel XxX

      Hello, back again from about 2 seconds ago. I would like to have a little rant and rave abuot people I know.  I know this is rlly rlly mean. But the person im most pissed off at thi present moment in time is   ** drum roll please**    Clare.  Its because shes always changing her name and saying its about boy trouble. Byut she never spills the beans, it really annoys me.and If I had a quid for every time she said no to the movies or town or to my house I think I'd be a trillon-air. It upsets me so much I feel like crawling into a hole and dieing, hence my name "Why do'n't I just crawl into a hole and DIE?" I just told Charlotte it was about Max, though when max is around I feel the same way.   La, di da,   Mel XxX

       hi,   these sales people keep phoning my house and saying "Hi is this the house owner" and I said "try next door" and put the phone down, then they phones again and said the same thing so I put the phone down again, and now they keep phoning and putting the phone down just before I say Hello. Weirdos I think its stopped now.           Talked to Charlo yesterday. Jeese, we have the WORST teachers ever next year. I think I better go stick my head in the ground, that would be best I think.          I haven't got round to asking her round. I sent her a text saying " r u doin any think nxt week?" I haven't got a reply back though.       I report back when something ATUALLY happens   Ciao for now!   Mel   XxX

       UUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH   Im SOOOOO Sick Of My Life!   I need a holiday, a v.v. long one even though I just had one, away from everyone I know because every thing rlly is getting on my ass.   Its all cos of fousseauu because we had that fight, and THEN to make matters worse, I found out that Clare will lie until something gets cleared up. for instance, we pranked jools, she got upset, clare lied and said she had nothing to do with it when she had everything to do with it. Ugh. That pisses me right off.I've found so much about her on Jool's blog. Check it out, its:    urlLink www.flyingcraponastick.blogspot.com    I also Had a huge fight with Charlo, she did a WONDERFUL blog about me on there,:    urlLink www.wouldnt-you-like-to-know.blogspot.com    Nice isn't it? I think i've cleared it all up with her...I think.   I had such a bad fight with her I had to cut myself 20 times. I even thought about suicide, God how weird am I? Thinking about that makes me so depressed. Mind you, sucide runs in my family. The cuts have cleared up now, after about 3 weeks. Grand. Everytime I saw something sharp, I'd think, Now how can I get that, go somewhere private and Cut myself?      I hate my family too, like for instance, Alex keeps comeing into my room in the middle of the night and making noise to annoy me when I'm asleep. I HATE ALEX. He's such a ginger bastard, I would like to put him in a giant garlic crush and crush him myself. Lol. That would be fun. I can't WAIT till my acting class's in 2 weeks, I haven't told anyone about it, the only people who know, is my family.      Ohhh, I hope I get the Main part. CAN'T WAIT! Still, Atleast thats something to look forward to. I rlly rlly hate school. I hate Dan and Sam espesially. Ginger bastards. They made myne and Jool's life HELL for months on end. I'd like to put them in a garlic crush too.      By the way, If you find my blog, then put a comment, And Don't both saying yuor jools or someone, because NO ONE knows about my blog, lol, sept me, (Duh)   Mel   xXx
