      So kristy is a dumb and extreamly stupid whore. Haha I need not explain to you but, I will anyways.  We were having a normal conversation and then she happened to mention that she was with skura last night *god only knows why* and I was like oh, thats cool, or whatever. And so she starts explaining shit like I was mad and was all like " We just went out for ice cream and blah blah blah until he was gonna talk with you" and since I wasn't mad I was like you don't have to justufy your hanging out with him to me, honestly, you can do whatever you like. And he was like "Don't get so high and mighty, I was just saying." So naturally, I was like, "Woah, Bitchy much?" Then she was like "You know what, You don't have to be worried about being invited to that lake with me anymore" THAT was her big come back..Made me laugh or a while. Then I was like "You know what? I seriously don't want to talk to you right now. I don't know why I bother, infact. I don't want to talk to you at all. Peace!" Then blocked her whore-ish ass:D So she went out with Skura tonight, What a WHORE! I so should have gone to that party with Peter and made out with him infront of Skura...Since they all went to the same party lol.  As for the Title...Yeah, I feel like a whore... So dirty.. Don't ask right now:S   Loveju!  PS: Work sucks! Its long! Haha. PPS: I want a boy to be there for me. You have Mark..Its not fair.. I just get used for ass. I want someone to buy me flowers and tell me I'm pretty...Damnit! :'(

      I know you can't help but worry, and I'm glad you care about me, but trust me, I'll be fine.   To address the sex with Mark thing ... I don't think so. I'd rather NOT lose my virginity to a pear, thanks. Hahahaha, whoa, too mean. Oh well. But yeah, just because I like him lots and we've fooled around a bit doesn't mean I'm gonna throw my morals out the window for him. He's not THAT special. Come on now, a little credit please. Lol.  See title. Well, I'm kinda just waiting for things with Mark to fuck up. I know that's a horrible way to go about this relationship but I'm just so used to it now. Nothing good can last forever, especially not with me. He means so much to me but I can just feel it now ... I can feel the hurt and the heartache that will come with the end of this and I'm just so scared. I'm scared of liking him even more than I already do because then the hurt will increase and I'm afraid that I'm going to fall apart. Oh god.  Lovesju!!!

Staying away for possible ever. The two can fuck eachothers brains out for all I care.  More about this boy? There is not alot to tell, hes a sweetheart. His name shall not be said now or possibly for a very long time...I shall inform you when the time is right. haha.  I'm glad things with mark are going good..Gonna be tough with no car and the whole being apart for the summer-ness. But ya'll can do it. lol. Just promise me you won't have sex with him unles your ready! lol.  I don't want to go to work...I want to sleep...Im tired...lol..  Loveju!

      Don't worry about me sweetie. I'll be ok.  :o)  And about Skura. Let's not offer him sex ok? And let's not have anything to do with him or Kristy.   Tell me more about this boy. Things with Mark are progressing nicely.

      Offered it to Skura...But then he went and told Kristy cuz apperantly they are like best friends now. Which I find total bullshit cuz they only started talking after I had told her how much I still like him and shit...And now they have hung out every day since then. What a whore.. Says she misses me and wants to be friends... Well Miss  this  Bitch! lol. Oh yeah, me and skura are e-mail fighting, how awesome is that lol.  Now about this "problem" of yours... I think you need to tell me more. Like are you anorexic  (can't spell) or what?  Because hun...This may start out as a small little thing, skip this eat less of that...But it grows..Like a monster..The less you eat the bigger it gets. Don't say don't worry... Cuz I can't.  It's like cutting... You can seriously hurt yourself. So lets talk about it okay? You know you are beautiful and don't need to diet right?  And yes, I miss you too... we definatly need to talk/ hang out sometime in the near future.. Both of us find out when we work, post it and we can find some time. What about Canada day cuz I don't think I work. I know you like Mark... Just remember to take it slow babes...And don't forget about me... lol.. Oh yes, and I had a talk with a boy last night, I think that I might like him. Well see where it goes though...Don't ask cuz I won't tell...Just know...theres a boy with definate possibilities..Thats all I got for now. Talk to you tomorrow?  Loveju!

      Sex with no strings attached? Who did you offer that to?  On another note, down another 5 pounds. Should I feel bad about this? Yes. Do I feel bad about this? No, not really. So, I've lost 10 pounds in the most wrong way possible. Should I stop? Yes. Will I? It's doubtful. I know I have a problem, but I don't want to stop. Many times I just can't help it. I'll be ok though. So no worries, ok?  To end this entry I say, I misses you and we have to hang out before I leave. Also, Mark means so much to me and I like him more than words can say.

      What kind of boy passes up sex with no strings attached!?! Honestly now, I think that he might be gay. And wow, does that ever make me feel unloved and unwanted. Oh god.    On another note:  I wish could've tied you up in my shoes Make you feel unpretty too I was told I was beautiful But what does that mean to you Look into the mirror who's inside there The one with the long hair Same old me again today (yeah)  My outsides look cool My insides are blue Everytime I think I'm through It's because of you I've tried different ways But it's all the same At the end of the day I have myself to blame I'm just trippin'  Chorus:  You can buy your hair if it won't grow You can fix your nose if he says so You can buy all the make up That MAC can make But if you can't look inside you Find out who am I to Be in the position to make me feel So damn unpretty I'll make you feel unpretty too  Never insecure until I met you Now I'm bein' stupid I used to be so cute to me Just a little bit skinny Why do I look to all these things To keep you happy Maybe get rid of you And then I'll get back to me (hey)  My outsides look cool My insides are blue Everytime I think I'm through It's because of you I've tried different ways But it's all the same At the end of the day I have myself to blame I'm just trippin'   You can buy your hair if it won't grow You can fix your nose if he says so You can buy all the make up That MAC can make But if you can't look inside you Find out who am I to Be in the position to make me feel So damn unpretty I'll make you feel unpretty too  Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh (oh) Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh (oh)   You can buy your hair if it won't grow You can fix your nose if he says so You can buy all the make up That MAC can make But if you can't look inside you Find out who am I to Be in the position to make me feel So damn unpretty I'll make you feel unpretty too

      Talked to Jasmin. Sort of figured things out. Said sorry for things I know I should have said sorry for a little while ago. I never say sorry. I hate saying sorry, but I knew it was right. So I did it.  What a night. That's all I gotta say. I'm scared to go home now. Blah.  Outdoor School, watch out, 'cause here comes Cyndi!!! Lovesju.  PS: Need to go shopping for the boyfriend. Belt and hat? Cologne? Haha, I don't even know.

      So wow, oh my, I want someone here to hold me right now. I want someone to be here to hug me and tell me everything will be alright. But thats jsut not going to happen. I want Mike to be here. I know, I'm stupid, but when I'm with him I feel safe. Hes my little security blanket. He's just there and can "protect" me from myself. Oh there is so much about me that no one knows. I don't know why but I feel so alone. I mean. Yes. I know that there are people to talk to but I just can't bring myself to spilling my guts to them. I think that my problems are mine. Thats all. I have security issues i think... I just don't know...Ugh.  Days since you cut? Hunny! Why?! I thought it had been months! You need to stop this! Your a beautiful girl and hurting yourself is not the awnser! You know that I am here to talk! I am so proud of you for not doing it today though! You have no idea! I love you.  So, you asked about my last post. It is kinda about Kaurie..Only kinda though. Just cuz well, I have learned so much about him over the last like few weeks and hes an awesome guy. But like us cuddling, holding hands, flirting (innocently), its so wrong, but at the same time. I feel safe with him, He makes me feel pretty (which doesn't happen often).  We talk about everything that is wrong and he tries to make it right. I don't know. But i guess Wayne had a talk with him about "us" not that there is an "us" but he was like...Stay away from her and all. I just don't know. I don't want to date him. I don't even like him like that. But hes jsut one of thsoe people who you could be friends with and not have to worry about them.  I feel like there is no one there for me. Maybe its like the old saying...Maybe I have just turned my back on the world, but it feels like the world is having a party and I'm not invited..Crying now and I don't know what for. Oh how I thiknk this title suits it, were messed. Loveju

      I'm so gross. I just ate a frickin' huge tub of chips and took down half a 2L of 7up. I'm disgusting. So I have this bingeing problem. I'll not eat for hours, I'll have one meal in a whole day and the next thing you know I'll be chowing down like nobody's business. What do I do? I haven't the slightest clue. I know I should stop, but I can't seem to. I feel so in control, so in power. And I feel like I'm finially shedding some pounds. You were right, Markus didn't pack up and leave after he found out that I was cutting, but I don't think he needs to know about this. He shouldn't have to deal with my problems, nobody should but me. For some reason though, I can't seem to deal with anything. Why am I so weak and easy to break? Sigh.   I was right: I was PMSing this past week. I just got my period. Oh joy. Funny, I had my period during first semester finals too. Hm. Except not for swimming, I don't think. I had it for swimming for fitness testing for Norwesters. Hahaha. How is this on topic? I haven't the slightest clue.   So I guess all I'm saying in this stupid post is that I have a couple of problems on my hands: I'm semi-depressed, I might possibly have an eating disorder and I can't seem to deal with my own problems. Oh jeez, I'm one messed up kid. Really and truly.  Lovesju!  PS: So I'm standing in the shower, thinking and re-evaluating everything that's going on and I realized something. I realized that I'm winning the fight against myself. So much that's going on is so shitty and I want to cut myself and get rid of this pain, but when I got out of the shower, I didn't. I'm stronger than that now. I'm believing in me in spite of my (oh, so many) flaws. I've taken my first step towards freedom and damn! It feels gooooooood! It's been 3 or 4 days since I've taken a blade to myself and I'm glad. I want to get better and I know I will. One day, I'll get to that place where I can get through a shitty situation without a physical scar. In the meantime, thanks for listening. I know you don't know what I'm going through, but it means the world that you can just listen and be there for me. You and Mark are amazing. The only people who understand that yelling and screaming at me won't help my situation. So patient, so amazing. I love you guys.   Yes, I love Mark. Not in the ... I LOVE YOU romantic kind of way. In the friendly way. Even though we're dating. Does that make sense? It makes sense to me.

      So ... Ricardo's fat. Haha sorry, but I still can't believe your sister's banging that. I'm surprised the motion in the ocean hasn't drowned her yet. But anywho ... I'm bored out of my socks and my tattoo is sore. I'm not looking forward to sleeping. It's gonna huuuuuurt. I'll try and sleep on my stomach.  So, bout you and Skura ... I donno what to say. I've said anything and everything that can be said about this situation. I think you need to realize things and work things out on your own with this one because I honestly don't know what to tell you to make you realize what you need to realize. I've told you before that you need to let go because you're an amazing girl and deserve so much more than this. Now you just need to OPEN YOUR EYES AND TAKE IN WHAT I'M TYPING!!!! Lol, I'm sorry. Anyway, I love you and I always will. :o)

      This is my theme song for Skura and myself... It has alot to do with the conversation we had the other day and what I'm not ready to talk about. Bolded what might give it all away..I know this is an "I told you so" but hey. My fault.   "My Happy Ending"  So much for my happy ending Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...  Let's talk this over It's not like we're dead Was it something I did? Was it something You said? Don't leave me hanging In a city so dead Held up so high  On such a breakable thread  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  [Chorus:] You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away  All this time you were pretending   So much for my happy ending  Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...  You've got your dumb friends I know what they say They tell you I'm difficult But so are they But they don't know me Do they even know you? All the things you hide from me All the shit that you do  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  [Chorus]  It's nice to know that you were there Thanks for acting like you cared And making me feel like I was the only one It's nice to know we had it all Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done  [Chorus x2]  [x2] Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh... So much for my happy ending  Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

      I don't know what I am&nbsp; going to do with myself while you are gone. Luckily I work every day till friday and you get home then...Since you are the only one who wants to talk to me. I'm considering becoming a hermit, don't think anyone would notice since I seem to be invisable to the family and no one else has really shown me any interest..  I want to tell you about this information but I know all that I am going to hear is .."told you so"&nbsp;for I told Chris today on the phone and he was not&nbsp;very nice and definatly did not say what I needed to hear... I just want someone to hold me and tell me&nbsp;that it will be alright...*takes a moment to compose myself* Cuz well..When I feel like I've hit rock bottem and it can't get any worse...Something will come and kick me in the ass, the floor will break open and down down down I go.. But oh well...What can you do.  I don't know if I can take much more of this though...Its like, my heart was already broken in half and now everyone is going at it with a baseball bat... I'm so fucked up.  Anyways, Don't worry about me. I hope that you have an amazing time at notre dame and make lots of new friends. I will miss you like crazy... From the day you get back till the day I leave we have 15 days together. Lets make them into a summer we will always remember..I love you and just want to say thank you for being there for me through everything that we have endured. Right now, You are the only one who hasn't turned you back on me, The only one who listens when I talk, cares when I cry, and is there for me...asking nothing in return. Thank you.  LoveJu!

      Ok, well I'm not gonna force you to tell me anything. But I am curious and I do want to listen and help in any way I can, so when you're ready, clue me in, ok?   So I think this trip to T.Dot is really what you need. I think you just need to get away for a while and get away from all this drama. Time for yourself is a good thing. Just don't do anything stupid, ok?   To end this blog, I say ... don't worry, m'dear. Things will begin to look up soon enough because whenever you feel like you've hit rock bottom, someone or something will pull you back up. Even when you feel like there's no tomorrow, don't you worry because I promise you'll be ok. But I'm off ... and I'm going to Notre Dame on Sunday so if we don't talk before then, I will most definitely call you from there. Wish me luck. I think I'm going to die.   Lovesju!

      So, I have been told some things...Don't know if he was trying to piss me off or if its all true but either way...Got so hurt I didn't even think it was&nbsp; possible...I want&nbsp;to cry...But I can't... But it sure is going to fuck me up in the long run...Don't ask cuz I'm not ready to talk about it without totally breaking down...  Working for the next 7 days straight...But now I think its not worth it...For the fucking government took $200 of my freakin check...Selfish bastards...Check was 845...took 200 away..(bitches) and I managed to get rid of all but 30 dollars in under an hour...But I owe Ricardo 20...So I have about 10 dollars to my name for the next two weeks...  Sooo tired...Was up 'till 6 just laying in bed thinking about things...Makes me sad to think...Specially about what was going threw my head...Conclusions from this thinking:  Boys fuckin suck No matter what, I can't hate skura, Im not even mad at him. Love is a mother fucker and can be very deciving. Wayne can have his space...Don't need him. Don't need anyone.  Nuff said.

Also, I am making a mends with the people that I have fucked over and been a bitch to..Or atleast I'm trying to...I have realized how many people don't like me and its not a good feeling...So I'm trying...But I think this is going to be a growing up summer...A time for me to find out who I really am...I hope I'm ready for what I find...

      Mark was not in my plan. I didn't see him coming and he completely took me by surprise. He fucked with my system. Hell, my system's just gone out the window. I was ok with being bitter and hating love. I thought that I could get through on random hookups, no strings attached (even though we both know I was yearning for a relationship, right?) but no, Mark had to come along. He made me fall head over heels for him, he completely skewed my idea of love and he makes me want to cry. I want to cry because no one has ever seen me like he does. No one has ever taken the time to really look at me and try to find the things he's found. No one&nbsp;has made me feel so loved and appreciated (note that by no one, I mean no guy). And it just makes me want to cry because it's so overwhelming. I was used to a life of depreciation and snide remarks. I was used to a life of lies, trying to convince myself that I would be ok without love, that I would be ok shutting people out. Now my heart is mad at me because it wants to let him in but my head wants to shut him out. I know I'll regret it if I hold back but I'm so scared, Sara. What do I do when he breaks my heart? How am I gonna be able to handle that? Am I going to start cutting again? I'm too emotionally unstable for any sort of drama so naturally, I try an prevent it by cutting people off.   Anyways, off to work so more later maybe.

      I do believe I've found our new theme song ... &nbsp; -------------------------------------------------- &nbsp; I will stand up for you no matter what you are going through, going through, going through  You found a place where you belong  New friends that can do no wrong  That's what you believe  But who is going to be there when you fall  To build up when you are feeling small  Give you love that you need  Who will, I will  When the whole world turns against you,  Ain't no lie  &nbsp; Chorus  Don't you know that I will stand up for you  No matter what you are going through  I'm still on your side  Any time day or night  Don't care if it's wrong or right  I'm still on your side  &nbsp; You want to run you want to break free  What you want ain't what you need  Can't you see that I care  I know I'm hard on you sometimes  But when you are looking for the things you can't find Don't you know who'll be there  Who will, I will  When it's more than you can handle  Ain't no lie  &nbsp; Chorus  &nbsp; I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there  I'll be there when you need me I won't let you go  There's nothing I won't do I'll be there  &nbsp; Chorus  &nbsp; I will be around when the others let you down  I'm still on your side  Anytime you need help and you can't find nobody else I'm still on your side

      It wasn't really that much of a conversation...I asked him about the girls...He said that it was a coincidence and they preety much just said "hey, hows it goin?" While stoped at a red light...Then the light turned and off they went...Thats all. Then we were talking about monday and ice cream. Trust me. THATS IT!!!

      Hmm, So yeah,&nbsp; staying away from Skura and not talking to him should not be a problem anymore..Since he won't talk to me. haha. Im pathetic. But whatever, hes dumb. I'm done with him.  &nbsp;  Kaurie now, haha, I guess we have to "have a talk" tonight cuz I won't talk to him and hes been "thinking alot" and stuff. He was crying on the phone the other night cuz I was just like, fuck this. I really don't want to talk to you anymore..ect. Yeah, Kinda sad...I feel bad cuz I blew him off the other night to clean my boss's apartment so I will talk to him for a bit tonight maybe...  &nbsp;  As for Mark, Don't worry about it. Hes not only with you cuz you like him and you think he wants better but can't get it.&nbsp; Hun, your an amazing girl and are WAY better than girls like Kendra and Chelsa. You see, they are pretty girls but so are you! And they aren't smart...Kinda really airheads infact...Those girls have got nothing on you. I promise.&nbsp; You are an amazing girl and any guy would be incredibly lucky to be with you. Don't you ever forgot it or let anyone makek you think differantly.  &nbsp;  LoveJu!!

      So Mark and I were talking about his car and how I like the Civic better than the truck. Then he goes on to say that while he's driving the civic, hot girls always come and talk to him so it's like his pick-up car. And I was like ok ... then he said for example, the other day Chelsa went and talked to him. I was like "Are you trying to make me jealous? And are you saying she's hot? Choose your words wisely." ... reply "No I'm not and yeah, she's alright." WRONG WORDS. So I got mad at him for that. I was like well, I don't need to hear about hot girls from my boyfriend while I'm in Vancouver. And then he went on and on about how I'm the only girl for him and blah blah blah, so of course I forgave him. I thik he only likes me because I like him and because he knows he can't get girls like the twins. My insecurities are beginning to show again.  And Skura ... I know you lost it to him and he's a big part of your heart but you need to let him go sometime. You'll have better sex someday. Lol. I don't know wht to say because whenever I tell you to stop talking to him, you do anyway and end up getting hurt. You just need too realize you're better than him and can do so much better than him.

Because I AM CANADIAN   says: but w/e, i don't care wut u have to say about this...just take me off ur fucking msn and be done with it"  And the whole time I'm thinking what the fuck is his problem...Less than a week ago he was telling me how much he loved me and how much he missed me..I know I shouldn't care...But it hurt.. More than I let him believe..But still..I mean, Hes the first boy I fucked..I have some right to care about him and he should have no right to me that fuckin mean to me for no reason...  At the end I send his an e-mail that went like this   "Subject: Fuck you then, But your going to regret being a prick to me  Contents on email: Honestly baby..Your going to be fucked when you want me back, *(or something like that)* you always do. Nuff said.  Love you (k)!"  So sad...So pathetic...i'm going to go to bed and cry...By the way..Next week I don't work on monday..Or wendsday, thursday...So we must have atleast one of those days together! I misses you...I need someone to talk to right now:( I'm sad...and its his fault..Damnit! well. Night.  LoveJu!!

You should be.   I still need your opinion on that rice keychain thingy. My friend Nicole says I should just give it to him because she's never heard of anyone being dumped over rice. Haha.  This has shown to be another pointless post. Apologies.  Lovesju!

      Well, I get back on Saturday night-ish so I'd be seeing you guys on Sunday. Maybe we'll visit you at work or something. But yes, I do most definitely want to see you!   So I need your opinion on something ... I got Mark one of those keychains with the grain of rice in it. On the rice it says his name then my name with a heart ... so should I give it to him or will it seem too committment-y??? I donno ...   Anyhow, I'm in a rush, so better blog later. Lovesju!

      Awe, Cyndi. Thank you hun. It really means alot to me. When I read that last enrty is made me cry...honest to god...it was so sad. I misses you ALOT! I hope its a new year and a new start but I'm not so sure.   I was on the tele with kaurie not so much fighting or arguing...But..talking? about us and me being like...Umm no. And he like wouldn't hang up the phone...It was like 4 in the morning atleast and he was like no..I don't want to stop talking to you now cuz you don't want to talk to me later (which is true) and he was saying how he wants to date and he wants to tell everyone and all this. The only reason that he was saying this though is cuz I walked home from work and refused to get into his car or talk to him:) Go me! But hwe really wants to talk to me tomorrow night I guess..I don't know...I will talk to him and see how that goes? I'm so dumb/ weak/ sad... Why can't I just find a nice boy?!  But yes...What day are you getting home? I sure want to see you like crazy! I work friday, saturday, sunday till close. But if you get home on one of those days I'm sure that I could try and make it so I'm 'round...If you want to see me that is. Or you could just have some Mark-y goodness;)  Well.. I will talk to you later I guess...I MISSES YOU!!!!!!!!!!  LoveJu!!!!!

      You are one amazing lady. You have been through so much in such a short time and you've still managd to come out in one piece. I mean, there are some bumps and bruises, a few scars but they're just a reminder of how strong you've been. You and I have been to hell and back this past year but we've managed to find in each other a truly great thing. We have an awesome friendship and I wouldn't trade it for anything. You have so much potential to be whatever it is you want to be; you just need to see it through. I know you feel worthless and every other horrible feeling but you have to know it's not true. Grade 11 is coming up ... a new  year, a fresh start ... take advantage of it. You'll do great and I'll always be at your side to help you up when you fall. No matter how mad I am at you, I'll always lend a helping hand. You deserve the best so always remember that, ok? Things will look up if you let them. Don't give into Skura. I know it's hard, but like I said, you're strong. Don't continue seeing Kaurie because you deserve better than that. You don't need to be his dirty little secret, you don't need to be the one he calls when he wants some. You're more than that, you're better than that. However, I've been where you are and I've felt what you're feeling and I know that nothing anyone can say will make you see yourself in a different light. You have to do it yourself, you have to realize it yourself. But I just want you to know that I'll never turn my back on you, ok?   Lovesju!  PS You're sixteen!!!!! =D Soon I'll be sixteen!!! We're gonna paint the town red this summer and this coming up school year, alright?

      ... Well, it has been quite the adventure. Many stories to share when I get home. However, there is one that must sbe shared now. I was driving today for the first time ever in Vancouver. So I'm driving along in the GIANT BOAT (the van) and all of a sudden the tire pops. It scared the shit out of me and I hit the curb. So we're on the side of the road, me and Natalia,and we're like "Well shit." It really sucked, but now that it's over, I can kinda laugh about it. What a story hey? A good and busted tire the first time you drive in a big city. And apparently we're moving out here in 2 years. Hm.   But I misses you. Get your cell back so we can text!!! Mark and I have been texting each other. I misses him too. I called him for like 30 seconds ... it was so good to hear his voice again. I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND A PRESENT FOR HIM!!! Whatever will I do?????

      Cyndi! I think I am falling in love with you! You break my heart and I will kill you! Hehe. I misses you! So much! This thing about Mark is awesome. But I'm not going to tell him, that is something that you have to do on your own.. When the time is right you will know.  Now, With Skura...I don't know, I love him but he is so bad for me. I can't be with him and I know it. I like just don't want to let go. He plays with me and my emotions so much though. Like, he kinda controls my life, Cuz depending on how he is to me on any given day it totally effects my mood, who I talk to and where/when I do things.  I never wanted to be like this...To be caught up in a relationship that I just couldn't let go even though I know that I can do better...  Kaurie...Oh kaurie...Hes awesome but you know. We have the same best friend who knows that something is going on and neither one of us will admit it for the fact that well... Wayne would kill us and we would never hear the end of it. But this whole secret thing, having to lie to our friends...Having to lie to Wayne, its really not cool and I don't want to do that. Cuz well...Been there, done that, (Skura) and it didn't end up good. We both lost our friends for a bit...But haha, More than likley everyone will find out on Saturday for the fact that Jasons birthday party is a hot tub party with alot of drinking involved..Haha Oh my.  I MISSES YOU!!!!  Now, let me ask something. What the FUCK is wrong with me. 3 boys, less than a week. Been with Kaurie every night but 2 of em. My god, dirty in every sense of the word. I mean, I feel really wrong about it. None of them know about eachother or anything, but I know..and that is enough for me! I hope that you get to read this and update while you are in Van. Look up Sam while your there;) Muhaha.   LoveJu!!!  Ps. if this doesn't make sense its cuz I got sidetracked while writing it!

      I like Mark so much. I love Mark. But not in the "marry me" sense. In the friendship-y sense, but with a little more to it. So much more to it that it can't be put in the same column as the friendship-y type. You know what I mean? I want so badly to talk to him right now. I miss him like mad. I want to tell him how I feel. I want him to know that he means more to me than he could possibly imagine. Isn't it funny how I went into this with a shitty attitude, not wanting to give it my all for fear of getting hurt but now I've done a complete 180? It's weird how one person can make you feel so many things all at once. I feel so safe with him, but at the same time I feel like I've lost all the control I've ever had. Whenever I'm with him, I can't stop smiling but the thought of losing him kills me; my lip quivers and I can feel the tears forming but then he does something to make me smile again and so he never really knows how I feel. I feel beautiful with him, I feel appreciated and loved. See what I mean? I can't handle all these things at once, but this is what he does to me. Seeing him gives me butterflies in my stomach and kissing him sends off fireworks in my heart. He makes me happy in a way that no one else has before. He gives me this security that I've never felt in my whole life. For once, I'm beginning to like myself and become comfortable with who I am. He's so amazing ... Once more, I miss him like mad.  I want to tell him all this. I want him to know all this is going on in my head, but I don't know how. I want to just show him this entry or e-mail it to him and see what he says, but I'm scared. I'm scared that I'll freak him out and he'll go running. I'm scared that he doesn't feel the same way. I want him to nkow all this but I don't want to tell him. But I do want to tell him. I don't know. YOU TELL HIM!!! Haha. You can e-mail him this entry or something. I'm pathetic. Haha don't tell him I told you to, if you decide to. That would be just dandy.   Anyway ... about Skura. What's his deal? Why does he have so many facades? I can't fucking keep up. One minute he's breaking your heart and the next he's the most amazing guy ever. I think your best bet is to stick with Kaurie. Why don't you see it anymore?? I'm so confused. As to him being a bad kisser ... tell him. Hahahaha. I DARE YOU. =]   But I must be off to work, so yes.  Lovesju!

      So, today has been kinda a long day and I haven't been able to talk to you or tell you what has been going on for a while..So this might be long. I MISS YOU! *kiss*  So there is alot of crazy stuff to talk about. First off, don't worry about Mark, hes dumb but still awesome, I don't know..Maybe you can loose recpetion while lext messaging...Its possible...I have never tried. Did you tell him about the whole love thing? Thats awesome and cute and insane all at the same time.  Now, Things for me have been very very weird latley... Doing awesome with Wayne, God I love that kid:)But Kaurie...:S I don't even know. I mean.. Were good and stuff but, were a very differant good..And I know that we are so definatly going to get busted, more than likley very soon. Everyone already thinks that something is up. And like we always show up places together and everyone is kinda like wft mate..And were really dumb, cuz like, when we are out with people we kinda try to stay off/ away from eachother but then we he/ we think that no one is looking we'll like kiss or start holding hands or something and its like wtf! Were gonna get caught! And then Wayne will be mad and I don't want him to be.  But how things go started with him are odd... We were just watching a movie one night and I said something and he pushed me off the couch..So I gave him a dirty look or something and he picked me up and put me on his lap...And then he just kinda kissed me... it was cute..But the boy could not kiss for shit at first...Still can't really..But don't tell him that... Alright, and so for the last 2 weeks we have been together everyday at least for a bit..and every night till like 5..He came over when I was drunk to take care of me and make sure I was okay..Then waited till I feel asleep and covered me up before he left. Hes a sweetheart and everything but he wants to like fool 'round alot and I dunno, I think its cuz he thinks I'm like a hoe..But he says that he really likes me and everything and he is super nice to me..I don't know though..So many flaws.. I swear..If I had the most perfect boy ever I would find something wrong with him..Never settle.  Now, for the other boy...Skura...Oh god, I love him so much. We had an awesome time together. I was drunk out of my tree for the last little bit but he never tried a single thing. I was impressed...But we talked good, it was cute. I was like "You know I missed you like insane hey? " and he was like " Oh god, I know, but you have no idea how much more I missed you" and hehe..He's pretty much awesome and like so so so whipped its not even funny. And yet we still laugh...I really really like him. But Wayne won't talk to me if I date/see/ talk to him... And so I don't think that the rewards out weigh the consequences...Blah..I don't know. I love him. Nuff said.  Work, Now work is interesting...I like the people...They are interesting..and funny and yeah. Its good stuff..Work 5 days a week 9 hours...7 bucks..Its not bad.And we don't do all that much, the boss is awesome. We have good talks. I think that I'm going to ask him if I can hostess soon..But then at the same time I don't want to cuz if he says yes everyone will think that it is just cuz he is dating my sister. And so its kinda not cool. But who cares.  Oh god, on another note. I am going to miss you! And Kaurie is gone this week too! Blah! When Kaurie gets home though I am taking his ass cell phone shopping! His phone is a peice and we were talking or whatever and it was beeping so I was like..Hang up shut it off, turn it back on and I will call you back okay?

      Love is: - all the little things - smiling through the tears - seeing beauty when the person is at their worst - disregarding distance - blind - arguing over small things and then making up 10 minutes later - no awkward silences - knowing you can say what you want to say - never being judgemental - acceptance of the person, flaws and all - hard work, but you don't know it because it doesn't feel like work - happiness - the warm fuzzies - a rollercoaster ride - worth the pain (I'm not so sure about this one) - falling and being caught before you hit the ground - friendship - an ice cream cone on an insanely hot day - out there somewhere  Add to the list what you may. Love is what you make of it. Love is different for everyone but this is the list I draw when I think about love. All this and so much more that I can't put into words. I know, I know ... "What happened to the Cyndi who hated love?" Well, she's still here. I mean, I  know  love is all these good things, but I'm still scared of it. I'm scared of falling so fast without anyone to catch me. I'm scared of heartache and I'm scared of pain. I'm scared of taking chances that have consequences such as a broken heart. I need to stop going into things, and through life, with my guard up, I know. But I can't help it; I don't know any other way.   So, now that I've sort of defined love for myself ... how do I know when I'm  in  love? Is it like in the movies? Will I one day have this sudden realization and have a light bulb go on in my head? I don't know. I'm so confused.   Then again, what right do I have to define love, (even if it is just for myself) when I've never experienced it romantically first hand? Maybe I have and just don't know it. BAH. This is too much thinking for me.   Lovesju!  PS: Disregard the last entry. I was not in a good mood.

      See title. Don't answer that.  So Mark and I are text messaging while he's on his way to the lake right. And then he goes "I g2g, I'm losing reception." YOU DONT LOSE RECEPTION WHEN YOU GO TO THE LAKE!!!! It's called long distance plans and especially with texting you don't lose reception. Do I look stupid? Pissed me right off. If he didn't wanna talk, just say you gotta go. I DON'T NEED A STUPID ASS EXCUSE!!! Fuckin' gonna shoot that motherfucker. Who does that? Normally it wouldn't be so bad except that we don't see each other for 2 and a 1/2 weeks so you'd think he would want to talk. I know I'm reading into this too much, but I don't even care right now. See, this is why I don't want to be wiht him sometimes. I hate losing the upper hand. I hate being the one that wants him instead of vice versa. I feel so vulnerable and not in control. I hate not being in control. Haha, in my anger, I sent him a text message that said "Jerk". I don't even care. That bitch said he'd never hurt me. I think I'm going crazy. It's a text message. Why am I getting like this? Buh. I need sleep.

      No worries. Fuck Kristy. Fuck Skura. Seriously ... FUCK KAURIE!!!! Lol. You know you wanna!  Anywho ... leaving on Monday. Any special reuqests as to what I'm getting you from Van? Well, don't care cuz I probably won't listen. Hahah. Ho hum. Mark just left about an hour ago. We were good tonight. First freakin' time too. Hahaha. I swear, everytime we're together we mess around. It's becoming a habit. That's why I'm kinda glad I'm leaving. I mean, I'll miss him but I think we need some time apart to really appreciate the relationship, ya know??? I donno. I just think that's what we need. However, a month is TOO LONG!!! He'd better not have to go.  Anywho, I'm tired. Will phone you tomorrow. Lovesju!

      See title. Nuff said for someone who puts up with little penis jokes and dinosaurs getting shoved up his ass. Lol, oh god... saddest thing you've done in a long long time.  But yeah, the Ex was a good time. "Hey Cyndi, green shirt!" "Where?" *Cyndi does a 360* ... "Can't find him." "HEY! I know what you guys are doing!" "Nothing ..." Lol. I love him.  Now I need to find a ride to my hair appointment. I really don't want to ride my bike because I'm lazy and I have to work after. It takes 2 hours to do highlights so imagine how long it'll take to color it and highlight it. I can't very well bike to work. So I need to find a ride so that my family can pick me up after. Ho hum. I sure wish I had gone for my licence earlier. Sigh. Where's the boyfriend when you need him? Oh yeah, out at the lake swinging bats at balls. Silly boy.  Kaurie's a little bitch. Skura's a dink. And you could do better than both of em. Yay!!! :D  I feel so fat after last night. Ugh. Yuck. Never again.

      Yo, Whats crackin.  So ex today...It was fun, Unpopulated with hott boys until the boyfriend showed up, but thats alright...We can look you just can't touch. Haha. No, I like Mark, Hes a good kid, and he puts up with me so thats cool. I just wish that one of us could drive so that we could do things without him too. I don't think that he likes me all that much anymore. I know I'm hard on the kid. I should stop...But its entertaining..Haha  Umm, I don't know. I want a boy but I don't think that I can have one right now. I don't need any hook ups either, Im aite. You think that if I wait then a good boy who wants to be with me (and is hott) Might come my way? I doubt it but hey, you get what you deserve... Hence why I haven't gotten much for boys... Boo  Kauries sad...And whipped. Sooo sad. haha, All I did was make fun of his car and his new girlfriend and he didn't do a thing. Muhahaha.  So Skura was at the ex..DAMNIT! I wanted to point him out to you. Grrr... I spose he didn't crash it, but its fucked up. Which is alright for me I spose. Blah...Be there tomorrow though too...I think that we should hit it up for a small amount of time..find him,  make sure he sees me...Then hit eastside for supper... Yes?  Alright, after work, You call Sara:) yay.

      Haha Yeah, Mark did pick it out and that was my reaction at first but then I was like...Well...It's actually kinda nice. And he really seemed to like it. So yeah, I think that you should like the other one, its more your style.  I hate work, I mean I really hate it...lol...But I get paid today:D yay me.  Crappy entry. Fixed my computer. I'm so smart. They should pay me for this shit. SO bored. So grumpy. Soooo Hungry.. Come visit me at like 10 tnight:) hehehe, call me later. We shall talk.

      First reaction to the necklace was something along the lines of, "Uhh ... Mark must have picked this out." I didn't say that out loud. But now I like it. It looks better on than it does in the box is all I have to say about that one.   So I had a real freaky dream last night. I was at Notre Dame except it wasn't basketball camp. It was some sort of secret mission type thing and something went wrong. So there are all these people with guns everywhere threatening to kill us. And I tried to run away but then they were shooting at me and a couple bullets skimmed my palms and I was bleeding and everything. It was freaky. I hope this isn't a reflection of how my year is going to go: people shooting at me. I haven't remembered a dream in a long time, why did I have to remember this one? And of all the nights, it had to be the night of my birthday. Jeebus.  But, overall, this was a decent birthday. Wish you was here though, biatch. =) G'night.  PS T-Mac is sexier than sexy.

      Sweet Sixteen and needin to pee. In other news, I'm 16 now! This had better be a good year. We're gonna paint the town red and let everyone know how awesome we are. Haha, ok, I'm cool. Just shh. Anyways ... damn you for not being here on my birthday. But we do have to go out and do something before you leave, that's just a given. I think I'm doing something with Sammy today, so it's not a complete waste of a birthday. And then something with Mark. I want both of my presents!!! Haha. Oh sigh.  So I'm 16. I don't feel any older, wiser or more experienced. I feel like me, a girl who needs to piss like a racehorse. But when I look back on 14, and even 15, they just seem so young and long ago. I don't know if I'm making sense or not but it makes sense to me.   Anywho, call me when you get back, okeys? Lovesju!

      Hey baby! Happy birthday!!!!!!! Sorry that I'm not going to be there for either one of them but before I leave..Maybe the saturday before I can take you out for supper at eastside..Or the ex day...You and me baby...  As for Skura,  I had a good talk with his best friend about it and I'm good. I can deal with it and it's going to take a while and an amazing boy but I am going to get over him...I'll be good.:D  Regina sucks, I want to be at home. But at the same time it is really nice to just get away from the mess that I call my life. I honestly think that me going to Toronto is going to be really really good for me. I need to get away from it all. Work, friends, boys, my family...For a while...Have some happy me time:)  This is kinda a shitty entry cuz I'm talking to jeff at the same time.  PS: Fuck, I need a random boy to mack on right NOW! It would help me out right now..And I need a drink...Blah...Boredness...Update better tomorrow...   HAPPY B IRTHDAY BABY!!! Sweet 16:P Whens the road test? hehe  Loveju!!!!
