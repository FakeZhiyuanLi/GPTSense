      Princess Diana's anniversary will be in a few days time.  August has always been a very trying month for me. This is the month where I am reminded of the whole Life & Death issue - a few of you already know why.  On August 23rd 1997 I lost a friend in an auto wreck. She wasn't speeding, drunk, high or careless. She hit some roadwork equipment that had been accidentally left in an awkward position and lost control of her car. The end.  Or so I thought.  Steph was my partner in kitchen. Because the kitchen environment functions heavily on a "buddy"system, your partner is someone that you rely on. A lot! There's a bond between you that very few people outside will ever be able to relate to.  The cuts, the scrapes, the aching backs, the broken plates, the sore feet, the oven burns, the fights, the yelling matches, the teamwork, the severe pressure, the chilling out over a beer after work, the knowledge that someone's watching out for you 150%. It was all a fantastic blend of what I thought I wanted out of life.  I felt young and confident. I was good at something and I knew it. I was arrogant too, but that is a necessary characteristic in the "industry". At this time I had also applied to and been accepted by Le Cordon Bleu culinary arts school. I had a chat with Steph about the possibility of her joining me in London first and then finally Paris. She promised me that she would give it serious consideration, and she was as excited as I was.  Then the next day the unthinkable happened and I was blissfully unaware, having not read the weekend papers where the accident had been reported.  So there I was on a Tuesday afternoon, walking to kitchen and feeling really pleased with myself. The week before Steph had said that I could take over some of her duties for a change and I was looking foward to them.  Got into the briefing room, everyone's in tears, even the boys, Chef looks pale, pulls me over to him, gives me a squeeze, "I'm so sorry mate", I spend a mandatory amount of time with the rest of the team before stumbling home in a state of shock.  And thats all I remember clearly. Everything else from that point until her funeral has kind of faded from memory.  But I do know that Steph's funeral service was on the same day that Diana died.  Nothing was ever the same for me again. Cheffing wasn't fun anymore. It was WORK! It was irritating and aggrivating. I was losing my temper often. Also, nothing seemed to mesh anymore. I was making constant mistakes. I got a huge amount of support from everybody and they really tried their best to make me feel at home again. But this thing that I loved doing so much was turning it's back on me and I couldn't stop it.  I also started getting very paranoid around my flatmates. If they were going out or to classes, I had to know exactly WHERE they were going and exactly WHAT time they would be home. Heaven help them if they were a little late without calling. I know that it was pretty destructive behaviour but luckily they were good enough to indulge me.  Steph's death changed my life completely. I know this is a selfish thing to say but if she was still alive, I probably wouldn't be back home in Malaysia - and I sure wouldn't be writing this now. Everything would have been different.  I probably will never be able to imagine what her family went through. They fell apart at the service and I hope I never, ever have to experience that kind of pain in my life. There was a poem. Until that point I had always associated it with the Funeral Scene from Four Weddings And A Funeral. It was moving, to say the least - especially these lines:  The stars are not wanted now Put out every one Pack up the moon And dismantle the sun Pour away the ocean And sweep up the woods For nothing now Can ever come to any good - "Funeral Blues" by W.H. Auden   If you've ever read the full poem you'd probably agree that it's laden with strong overtones of loneliness, apart from mouring. But it does make you appreciate the small gifts life chucks your way - like a quick call from a friend who just wants to say hi. Or your mom doing something small but considerate for you - like folding your socks. Stuff like that. Things that make you want to grab the ones you love and never let them go. So it's never really "the end"for those of us who are left beind, although it may seem like it at the time.  Yes there are a lot of painful regrets. But I'm learning how to say "screw it, thats life". I also still get a little thrill whenever I see someone wearing a chef's white uniform. Out of habit I'll smile and think to myself "I used to be one of you guys."  So Cosmic Girl if you're reading this with that gorgeous smile of yours, I finally put it all down.  Che, Steph.

      Just had a nice chat with an ex-UWCer Utsav. Utsav and his wife will be going to KL at the end of November and he was asking for basic info i.e. where to stay, where to eat.  I made it a point to emphasize Madam Kwan's in KLCC - god I miss the food there. It's so addictive.  Am really craving something spicy for lunch - Krishna's fish head curry would be nice - BUT the only problem is that it makes me real sleepy especially after lunch, and this heat doesn't help either.  Its pretty hazy over here now. Yesterday was pretty bad and I could barely make out the Yayasan Sabah Building from the city - which is usually very easy to spot. Hope it doesn't last for too long! Bloody illegal burnings.  Just got a call from Feona who wants to play golf tomorrow but I don't think I can due to this stupid little cut on my finger which is actually pretty painful - and swinging a golf club for 4 hours is not going to be pleasant if one of your fingers hurts. Shame tho cos I really need the practice. Have been surprisingly free for the last one week - so much so that it's actually irritating. Am not used to not having much to do in the office - usually am swamped with so much paperwork I can barely make it out of the office for lunch.  Ok back to the music and mood thingamy: Music - "Figured You Out"by Nickleback Mood - Neither here nor there. Bit weird actually.  Later dudes.

      Hi y'all,  It's pretty early on a wednesday morning. Day 2 of my blog escapades and I've already got some news back from you guys.  Nicole thanks for your email, always great to hear from the scottish lass (what tyyyyme issit?). I know you had some queries about the Blog thing - basically if you sign up with my site you can post your comments about anything I've written. It's pretty easy once you get the hang of it.  Hav to go to this Malaysian Medical Association dinner on Saturday night. Considering I'm NOT a doctor, I somehow get free invites every year - must have something to do with the fact that a large number of my friends in KK are in the medical profession. From what I've heard they're flying in a Belly Dancer (!) to perform, so that should be oodles of fun to watch.  And most of the new friends that I make over there are actually pretty nice people.  The Pro's & Cons of the MMA Dinner: Cons: Have to wear a permanent smile plastered on face until it hurts. Have to pretend to be interested in obscure and downright weird medical conversations (i.e. do you know what a healthy vagina smells like?) - seriously! Have to explain to every new person I meet that I'm NOT a medical professional. Lots of speeches.  Pros: Free food, free drink and the chance to catch certain "well-behaved" people get stinking drunk and make asses of themselves.  Right, it's settled. I'm going.

       Harro! Finally got my butt into gear and got Blogged! It's now 5:39pm on a Tuesday afternoon and I am getting what appears to be a tension headache. The joys of work!      I finally figured that this is the "bestest" way to stay in touch with all of you guys and still not exclude anyone. So no more bitching okay? Hehe.        Just had my lunch (it's almost 6pm) of Mickey D's Chicken McNuggets. Not the most healthiest of lunches but when you live alone you gotta grab what you can, when you can.    I usually have a proper sit-down dinner with friends around once a week. Otherwise it's quick pub grub at my local - which is great cos I only have to cross the road to get fed. The Manager is a close friend, and I think that she's in league with my mom to make sure that I have my dinner - otherwise I'd probably end up forgetting to eat.      In case you're wondering, this bastion of hospitality is called The Shamrock. It's one of my favourite places, not just because they have Kilkenny's on tap (Yum!), but because of it's bloody brilliant views. See it to believe it.        Was on MSN Messenger with Bi earlier but she's of to buy groceries for dinner. Got some really old UWC pictures from Erin, I mean these go WAY back! Am touched that she's still hung on to them after all this time.       Have done my fair bit of harassing for today I think. Have harassed both Kelvin and Zubin into coming over to visit me. Kelvin reckons that the end of the year should be good and that sounds fine by me. Am looking foward to seeing the Auckland gang down here for a change. They always take such good care of me whenever I'm in KL that it's about time for me to show off my famous East Malaysian hospitality. And yes Sayur Manis too, Vera!      Everytime I read other people's blogs, I notice that they always list out what music they're listening to and what kind of mood they're in so I'll do the same.      Music:    Radiohead - Talk Show Host (Romeo & Juliet Soundtrack)      Mood:   Heartburn cos of too much coffee, so the mood ain't all that great.      Right I'm off to see what scary photo's I can rustle up.

      Just got this in from Avi. ThankYou! And you're right - It's good and I like it.   'T is often said that those best together, Must share betwixt 'em a mirror'd feather; But contrary to this old cliche, There are those who swear by this polar phrase: That opposites do, in fact, attract-- That fire and water is what makes a match. Alas! allow me to give ye some advice, From one who has dealt with "friends" in life (Whether born of pettiness or jealousy): Expect the burn of a blade in ye! So, away with ye polar-bonds and feather-liked, I shall keep my own keep; live a hermit's life. Unless I find one who's honour bound, For this trait in one makes a union sound. For not all who break ye bread are true, For true friends are but far and few.

      Everyone knows that I like my beer.  I'm a bit of a beer freak. I am always up for trying new beers and comparing their malty bodies and flavours to old dependables like Tiger or Heineken. There's nothing I enjoy more than to be with my favourite people, having a couple of cold ones while watching the sun set. At times like that all feels right with the world.  Some people are into their wines and are able to wax lyrical about grape variety characteristics and what years were good. I'd like to think that I'm sort of like that in a way.  Yes, yes I am constantly the butt of alcoholic jokes but I put it down to the fact that well...people are just jelous of my love affair with the amber nectar. If only their personal lives were as uncomplicated as mine. He he.  But the one thing that always surprises me is how people feel the need to drink as much as possible in a short amount of time. We're not cheeky teenagers anymore, or college students out on a pub crawl. Why do people  want  to get drunk? Being drunk sucks. You slur your words, behave like an ass and dance like a moron.  The reason behind today's little diatribe is an outing I had last night with some industry people. Now these guys are Fun (capital F). They're wicked funny, interesting, lively, have the best industry gossip (remember what I wrote about men being the best gossipers around? Ref: my post "Men") and are all around good-time boys. I was looking foward to a relaxed night, chilling out with a couple of beers and was planning to be in bed by 11.  Fat chance.  The minute we arrived, the boys called for jugs of beer and bottles of red wine. I was to try their new drink - equal amounts of chilled red wine and beer mixed together. It actually tasted quite good - think of a frothy (but deadly) Ribena.  The panic set in when they announced that everyone had to "bottoms up". Being the only female in the group, I was spared from this stupid male ritual (thank gawd!). The boys polished off their glasses in a few seconds and proceed to refill. They did this about 5 times. It's a macho guy thing I'm guessing. By the end of the night they were stinking drunk. One guy was sleeping in his chair, the next one had his head in his hands, another was trying to stand, and the last one was trying to balance himself against the bar counter. And to top it all off they were wondering why. Hello?  So there was little old me, the youngest in the group - and the most sober (3 beers over the space of 4 hours doesn't do much). I didn't know whether to laugh or to leave. Alcohol mixed with stupidity is a very bad combination. And I'll bet that there are some heavy-assed hangovers happening today.  A gentle reminder -  Drink Responsibly .

      Margaret Cho has inspired me to do this. During lunch I read some of her blog postings that were so moving I almost cried. And no I'm not getting soft.   What Do I Love?   My mother's kisses, my father's songs,  my grandfather's blue eyes, acting silly with childhood friends, old photographs, having a best friend, how my dogs look at me when I get home, sunsets, sunrises, the way a really cold Coke tastes when I'm hot, getting wrapped up in conversation, crying to The English Patient and James Taylor's "Fire And Rain", being hugged, the smell of cut grass, money, all my friends who know who they are, my Interschol yearbooks, Six Degrees Of Seperation, sleeping in late on a sunny Sunday morning, the air just before a massive thunderstorm, nuzzling the neck of "the one" many years ago, Sade's By Your Side - but only the Neptunes Remix, Sayur Manis with garlic, sitting in Bangsar on a Saturday afternoon and drinking with a buddy for hours, road trips, espresso, buying a bunch of great DVD's and rushing home to watch them all in one go, Madonna, the smell of the sea on my skin, making someone laugh with a funny story, Auckland in the summertime, the sea, positive minded people, ice-cream, United World College, you.  I'll be adding more things to this list later.

      I love Margaret Cho. I mean I  really, really  love Margaret Cho. She is  THE BEST  stand up comedian I have ever heard. Yes Eddie Murphy can still rock with "Raw" and "Delirious". But Margaret Cho? Duuuudes, this woman  brings it!   I think I've made McWanker and Cress copies of her stand-up act. Cress loved it, no reply from McWanker so it's probably lost somewhere.  For those of you who have never had the good fortune of pissing yourself laughing while listening to this woman go on about life as a Korean American - at least you can now read up about her. Sneaky little me, I managed to find her blog page:   urlLink http://margaretcho.net/blog/    Or if you just want a taste of why I love Margaret Cho so much you have to read this:   urlLink http://margaretcho.net/blog/iamnotnice.htm    I think if everybody laughed more, the world would be a somewhat more tolerable place...somewhat.

      I got an email from someone who wants to remain nameless, regarding the post I wrote on Men. Ok I have to admit that it's a woman - but no surprises there. She couldn't believe what I had to deal with. She even mildly chastised me for allowing someone, anyone, to make me feel small and inferior.  "How did you put up with that shit?" she asked. I dunno. It's just that sometimes we don't even realise that we are being made use of. And doesn't it just suck when we finally wake up and figure out whats going on? Yup, yup. For sure.  Oh yeah, people ask me for lots of work related favours. And most of the time if you don't oblige them a bit, they'll secretly get pissed off and it can affect your so-called "relationship". So the tactic we have to resort to is of the "grin-and-bear-it-now-for-I-will-be-swearing-at-you-behind-your-back-and-by-the-way-I-think-you're-ugly" variety.  But thats the way it is. When industry people come over here they expect the red blooming carpet. And god help you if you don't deliver. Most of them expect to be wined, dined, holidayed and so on.  Not surprisingly, I don't get any extra favours or attention whenever I go over to KL. If I'm lucky maybe a meal or two. Other than that they don't wish to be disturbed as they have better things to do. And they will never give up any time over the weekends. And if you DO manage to get them out (usually blackmail works) they'll lay some kind of a guilt trip like they don't really  wan t to be there but they  have  to. I'm sure you can relate.  Yet when they come over here, I am expected to be available at all hours. Usually for limo driver duty. I think the most ridiculous request the Mighty L made was that I was to pick him and his entourage up at 1 am from the airport. What? Yes I typed it correctly, 1 in the frigging morning. And what was that he was saying about me having late nights? Dick.  Get this, L's "good friend" was in KK last weekend. I have no idea who this chap is. Apparently this guy wanted to take a drive up to the mountains. So what does L do? Calls up my boss and asks for a "favour for my very good friend lah." My boss agrees to it and we spend a large part of Saturday morning arranging to have our company 4x4 vehicle sent to this guy so that he can drive around KK and explore at his leisure. Mate, have you heard of something called a Car Rental Service? Hertz maybe? I have nothing against this guy as I don't even know him - but I'll double down a thousand bucks that L assured him we were his butt monkeys.  However, there are a small bunch of industry people who are professional, friendly and most of all - genuine! They will go out of their way for me and for most things, all I have to do is call. When these people come over to KK, it is a pleasure to take care of them as they appreciate even the small things that are being done for them. These are the good apples.  I think my secret friend has made me realise a few things. The next time I go to KL, I am not going to bother even giving these people the time of day. Not even a courtesy call, cos it's not worth the $ on my mobile bill. Since my time is always limited, I am only going to spend it with my friends. At least with them I know they're not being fake. And they've always driven me all around, taken me to my favourite restaurants, drank till we were legless, partied until we were all partied out and the only thing they want from me is my time. They always go the extra mile to make me feel special and they're always happy to see me. What more does a git like me need?

      Some of my favourite  Oscar Wilde  quotes.  "Men become old, but they never become good." Lady Windermere's Fan   "Nowadays all the married men live like bachelors and all the bachelors live like married men." The Picture of Dorian Gray   "Women are meant to be loved, not to be understood." The Sphinx Without a Secret   "It takes a thoroughly good woman to do a thoroughly stupid thing." Lady Windermere's Fan   "I am sick of women who love one. Women who hate one are much more interesting." The Picture of Dorian Gray   "I prefer women with a past. They're always so damned amusing to talk to." Lady Windermere's Fan   "The public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worth knowing." The Soul of Man Under Socialism   "Young men want to be faithful and are not; old men want to be faithless and cannot." The Picture of Dorian Gray    But the BEST quotes are :  "One should always be in love. That is the reason one should never marry." A Woman of No Importance   "To love oneself is the beginning of a life-long romance." An Ideal Husband    Amazing. The man just knew.

      McWanker strikes again. Laughed so hard when I read this. Thought I was going to hurt myself.  "The Travails of Single South Indian men of conservative upbringing" or "Why we don't get any..."  Yet another action packed weekend in Mumbai, full of fun, frolic and introspection. I have learnt many things. For example having money when none of your friends have any is as good as not having any. And after spending much time in movie theatres, cafes and restaurants I have gathered many insights into the endless monotony that is the love life of south Indian men. What I have unearthed is most disheartening.  Disheartening because comprehension of these truths will not change our status anytime soon. However there is also cause for joy. We never stood a chance anyway. What loads the dice against virile, gallant, well educated, good looking, sincere mallus and tams? (Kadus were once among us, but Bangalore has changed all that.)Our futures are shot to hell as soon as our parents bestow upon us names that are anything but alluring. I cannot imagine a more foolproof way of making sure the child remains single till classified advertisements or that maternal uncle in San Francisco thinks otherwise.  Name him "Parthasarathy Venkatachalapthy" and his inherent capability to combat celibacy is obliterated before he could even talk. He will grow to be known as Partha. Before he knows, his smart, seductively named northy classmates start calling him Paratha. No woman in their right minds will go anyway near poor Parthasarathy. His investment banking job doesn't help either. His employer loves him though. He has no personal life you see.  By this time the Sanjay Singhs and Bobby Khans from his class have small businesses of their own and spend 60% of their lives in discos and pubs. The remaining 40% is spent coochicooing with leather and denim clad muses in their penthouse flats on Nepean Sea Road. Business is safely in the hands of the Mallu manager. After all with a name like Blossom Babykutty he can't use his 30000 salary anywhere. Blossom gave up on society when in school they automatically enrolled him for Cookery Classes. Along with all the girls.  Yes my dear reader, nomenclature is the first nail in a coffin of neglect and hormonal pandemonium. In a kinder world they would just name the poor southern male child and throw him off the balcony. "Yes appa we have named him Goundamani..." THUD. Life would have been less kinder to him anyway.If all the women the Upadhyays, Kumars, Pintos and, god forbid, the Sens and Roys in the world have met were distributed amongst the Arunkumars, Vadukuts and Chandramogans we would all be merry casanovas with 3 to 4 pretty things at each arm. But alas it is not to be.  Of course the south Indian women have no such issues. They have names which are like sweet poetry to the ravenous northie hormone tanks. Picture this: "Welcome, and this is my family. This is my daughter Poorni (what a sweet name!!) and my son Ponnalagusamy (er.. hello..).." Cyanide would not be fast enough for poor Samy. Nothing Samy does will help him. He can pump iron, drive fast cars and wear snazzy clothes, but against a braindead dude called Arjun Singhania he has as much chance of getting any as a Benedictine Monk in a Saharan Seminary.  Couple this with the other failures that have plagued our existence. Any attempt at spiking hair with gel fails miserably. In an hour I have a crown of greasy, smelly fibrous mush. My night ends there. However the northy just has to scream "Wakaw!!!" and you have to peel the women off him to let him breathe. In a disco while we can manage the medium hip shake with neck curls, once the Bhangra starts pumping we are as fluid as cement and gravel in a mixer. Karan Kapoor or Jatin Thapar in the low cut jeans with chaddi strap showing and see through shirt throws his elbows perfectly, the cynosure of all attention.  The women love a man who digs pasta and fondue. But why do they not see the simple pleasures of curd rice and coconut chutney? When poor Senthilnathan opens his tiffin box in the office lunch room his female coworkers just dissappear when they see the tamarind rice and poppadums. The have all rematerialised around Bobby Singh who has ordered in Pizza and Garlic bread. (And they have the gall to talk of foreign origin.)  How can a man like me brought up in roomy lungis and oversized polyester shirts ever walk the walk in painted on jeans (that makes a big impression) and neon yellow rib hugging t shirts? All I can do is don my worn "comfort fit" jeans and floral shirt. Which is pretty low on the "Look at me lady" scale, just above fig leaf skirt and feather headgear a la caveman, and a mite below Khakhi Shirt over a red t shirt and baggy khakhi pants and white trainers a la Rajni in "Badsha".  Sociologically too the tam or mallu man is severely sidelined. An average tam stud stays in a house with, on average, three grandparents, three sets of uncles and aunts, and over 10 children. Not the ideal atmosphere for some intimacy and some full throated "WHOSE YOUR DADDY!!!" at 3 in the morning. The mallu guy of course is almost always in the gulf working alone on some onshore oil rig in the desert.Rheumatic elbows me thinks!  Alas dear friends we are not just meant to set the nights on fire. We are just not built to be "The Ladies Man". The black man has hip hop, the white man has rock, the southie guy only has idlis and tomato rasam or an NRI account in South Indian Bank Ernakulam Branch. Alas as our destiny was determined in one fell swoop by our nomenclature, so will our future be. A nice arranged little love story.  But the agony of course does not end there. On the first night, as the stud sits on his bed finally within touching distance and whispers his sweet desires into her delectable ear, she blushes, turns around and whispers back "But amma has said only on second saturdays..."  Dei.

      I am not male bashing, I promise!  It has FINALLY come to my attention that there are certain male habits and traits that are irritating at best. I've tried my darndest (along with 99.9% of the female population worldwide, I'm guessing) to ignore, accept and hopefully correct these little shortcomings. We are all familiar with em so I'm not going to get into it too much but just as an example -  a) Pissing on toilet seats. In Malaysia, you're lucky if your man lifts the seat up at all.  b) Fondling / adjusting the "package" constantly - Mate, it's not gonna fall off.  c) Leering at any inch of female that walks by. Pig.   d) Gossipping. Believe me, men are THE biggest gossips. They put us women to shame. I speak as someone who spends a lot of time with male friends and have witnessed this first hand.  And the list goes on.  But back to me - You're probably wondering what brought about this onslaught - like I said, I'm not bashing. But today I woke up and decided to bitch. About one male in particular.   There's this one git. I mean this guy is a real c*#t. Lets just call him L. We started out as mates in the same sort of industry, but just at different areas . I know thats vague but it has to be for some level of privacy.  So here I am, thinking that this guy is pretty cool and has a good sense of humour etc etc. That is until he makes a business visit to KK with his boss. We take them out and hit the town, determined to paint it red. I personally made sure of all of that, as I was instructed by my bosses to take care of the visitors and show them a good time.  His boss is tired so retires early. L however, is a bit of a night owl and presses us to stay out with him until 2:30am.  Working day the next day and not only that, but we have a massive stock check to conduct. My boss calls me and says that L and co will be coming to my office later on in the evening to have a meeting. I rush through the stock check like a mad person with my staff, only taking 20 minutes to grab a bite and a smoke.  The stock check took 6 hours and I was on my feet the entire time. Find out that L has a headache so our bosses had the meeting at their hotel and don't need to come to the office at all. Okay.  To make matters worse, L brought up the names of all my key people and started slagging them off...diplomatically of course! But the cherry on the icing of the mound of shit that was his reasoning, was when he had a go at me. He did it very nicely of course i.e. "Actually Shan and I get on very well but I think that she has too many late nights and therefore that must affect her performance."...along with a few other choice comments which I have excluded.  My bosses were shocked at what he said, especially since he was the one that wanted to party the night before, but took it in stride. Until today they have never questioned my personal life or after hours at all. They trust me and know that I am a very responsible person.  They told me what L had said and I was naturally very angry...no wait I was enraged. I think thats a good word. I busted my hump for this fat loser and he turns around and stabs me in the back just to endear himself to my bosses? No bloody way.  So I make sure that he knows I hate his guts. I talk to his colleagues and staff, telling as many people as I can about what happened. Does this make me look immature? Yeah, but like I give a crap.  This JERK knew nothing about me, my life, my job or what kind of person I was. And yet he felt he was more superior and in a better position to pass judgement on me. And for what? He didn't gain a thing. And lost a friend. Had the displeasure of running into him in KL at an industry event. After all that was said and done, he sends over a jug of beer to the table where me and my colleagues are having a quiet drink. He stabs me in the back, makes comments about my lifestyle and then proceeds to send over alcohol to me, pretending like nothing happened? THAT was the final straw. I stormed out. He kept calling out my name as I went pass and I just said "Bitch" loudly.  He stayed out of my way for the rest of the event. So fast foward many months later and there's a event held here in KK. L calls me up out of the blue and asks if I can pick him and a colleague up from the airport. Can you imagine the nerve of this fat rhino? So I tell him fine and ask for his mobile number - for a minute L seems shocked that I don't have it. Ha bloody ha, mate.  I oblige out of some level of professional courtesy, and also due to the fact that he's close to my boss. I do the mandatory thing like taking them out for meals, driving them around, making sure that everything is taken care of for them and so on. But it seems clear to me now that the only reason he called was so that he could have an idiot (me) to be his personal driver, event co-ordinator, party organiser.  The one good thing that came out of this was that by being on talking terms, I now get to slag HIM off, in front of his people no less. The trick is to do it with a smile, disguise it as a joke, make everyone else laugh by putting him down, and that shuts him up because he knows exactly why I'm behaving like that.  That was probably the best bit of advice I ever got from my mom. She's the one who told me to do that - appear friendly, but wicked. I think I could do that for some time. Thanks mom!  And yes, thanks Bi I feel a LOT better now. It's like this massive weight (not unlike L's body mass) has been lifted off my shoulders. Whew!  Mood: Bloody excellent now!  Music: Pacific by 808 State. So old school :-)

      So I wake up this morning, after a REALLY bad nightmare where I'm getting chased by werewolves. It's a reoccuring nightmare, which is a real bitch let me tell ya. The good thing is I only get this dream about 3 times a year or so. But still, woke up exhausted and stressed instead of calm and rested.  Looked out my window to find huge clouds of thick, black smoke billowing around. Went upstairs to the deck to check it out. Turns out that the wooden houses in the Tanjung Aru area were on fire. Watched it for about 20 minutes before the fire trucks finally showed up. The weird thing was that it was pissing down with rain - but that didn't do much to stop the flames.  Driving to work with some good tunes in the car, expecting to get to the office in my usual 4 mins and 15 seconds. Turn the corner to find a MASSIVE jam - hey man, this is KK. Unheard of along my area.  Plodded along like a turtle on a mission only to find out that the cause of this major jam were 2 cars in a very minor fender bender - I mean COME ON!!! They couldn't even move the cars to the side of the road cos they were just standing there like idiots blabbing away into their mobiles to their wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunties, uncles, grandma's etc about how they had just been in an accident.  And a lot of the other drivers on the road were noting down the accident vehicles licence plate numbers so that they could buy the 4D (Lotto) later on. In Malaysia we have this belief that if you see a car crash you note down the plate numbers and if you buy those numbers, you'll win big.  How morbid is that? For Goodness Sake! I mean, honestly!  So I get into the office, feeling odd at how the day has started - and yes, I hadn't had my coffee yet.  Check my email and get a very pleasant surprise from my good friend Mary who's on the cover of this new Auckland mag:  urlLink www.citymixmagazine.co.nz  Have a look - she's the stunning blonde. Awww she looks so good! But that cover's only gonna be there till August 27th or so.  And that's just totally made my day. Very happy now!  Mood: Cheerful and optimistic.
