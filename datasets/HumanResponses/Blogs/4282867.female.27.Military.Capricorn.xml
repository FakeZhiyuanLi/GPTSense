        Now that I have totally fried my brain by continueing to research the web for my dream job, I am happy to report that the FAA is hiring Air Traffic controllers.  The downside is I need to be on terminal leave.  Note to self:  I have nine months to build a kick ass resume, network, and research the facilities I am considering as a future employer.  Now that the hard work of my day is done.  I got to goggle at some young handsome men that just stopped by Base Operations.  One tall dark and handsome, (who has been rumored to have a small penis, but that is info from a gay guy who got shot down),the other short and blond with bad teeth but a young strong body.  I know, I Iknow, I shouldn't think the way I do, but I am single with no boyfriend, so I can gawk all I want.  I wouldn't mind doing more but there are too many diseases out there and I've had enough sex in my life time.  Probably more than a woman should have in her life.  Anyways, I've got one hour left and I refuse to use it staring at the computer.  Signing off- NC

        O.K.  Where did I leave off?  Wait let me just set the record straight.  As an Air Traffic Controller I do not, DO NOT, stand outside and wave flags at aircraft.  I work in a control tower and communicate with the pilots all day.  Right this second I am working as an Air Operations Duty Officer.  Meaning I am babysitting an airfield.  So back to where I was at.  The military says that I am not physically within standards to continue as a soldier.  I can pass all the physical tests such as the run and the push-ups and sit-ups.  What I can't do, is conform to the military's required body composition standards.  I am not a 32'24'36, so therefore I do not have the option of reenlisting.  Because I have not lost the weight I gained after the birth of my son I am being pushed to the side so that other people can get ahead of me.  I use to be really bothered by the way my upper chain of command has completely closed its door on me, but now I see it as they are the ones at a loss.  They are losing a hard worker.  An intelligent and mature leader who has always been willing and able to work longer hours, volunteer offtime to support the military's constant push to be recognized as a good will embassador.     Here I am ten months out, I've decided that now is the time for me to take control for the life that I allowed to shelter for the past eight years.  I'm ready to let go of the past and lift up my head to see what successes await me.  So here begins my journey!  Wish me luck.  I still have three hours left in this office, so I'll continue to sit in front of the computer and search the web for where I should start looking for a job outside the military.

        Well here I am.  At work.  On a Saturday.  I am being punished for forgetting I had watch on the Fourth of July.  Why the hell would I be assigned to a weekend watch like that anyway?  You would think that seniority has its priviledges.  Oh, well.  So far things have been quiet here at base ops.  The aircraft that crash landed, yesterday, has finally been removed from the runway so the clean up crew can begin sweeping the runway.  Now all I have to do is sit and answer phones and take advantage of the free internet.    Rob called this morning.  He wanted to know when I got out of work, so that I could bring Brayden to his  house.  He's having a party or bar-b-que for his girlfriend, Tanus, because she graduated from RN school.  Not only does he own his own lawn service, and work at a DOD job, he has a girlfriend who should soon be getting a great paying job, so why can't he pay child support?  Don't get me wrong a check for one hundred and ninety eight dollars every other month isn't bad, and I have survived on my own income for the past three years, but it still feels like a kick in the gut.  Child support was set for five hundred dollars a month.   Enough about him.  This is diary is about me and my last ten months in the navy.  I had planned on getting out after my first enlistment but I got pregnant before I could divorce my ex.  Why does sex have to have such consequences when you're having a good time at it and you know you're good at it?  Especially when you don't want to spend the rest of your life with that person.  So now here I am going on my eigth year in the military as an Air Traffic Control specialist.  I have friends who say that the prospects are great in this field in the civilian sector, so I should get out while I am still younger than the cutoff age for FAA employment.  I want to get out but I am really comfortable in my cushy duty station.  If I were to stay in the military I would have to go to a ship.  I don't want Brayden to forget about me for six months at a time and start to consider my parents as his real parents.  It's bad enough his real father isn't in the picture.  I am also getting out becuase the military body composition standards - I've got to go out on the airfield and help inspect the runway status.  I'll write later
