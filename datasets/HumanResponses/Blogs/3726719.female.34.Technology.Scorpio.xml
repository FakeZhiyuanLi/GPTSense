      I know myself pretty well.  I know that I require at least 7 hours sleep to be alive and functioning the next day.  I know better than to stay up late on a work day.  Doesn't mean I always pay attention to that knowledge and do what is best for me.  So, in a fit of self-pity avoidance (that whole loneliness thing), I left the house at 9:30 last night to go catch a late movie.  Evidently the clothes I threw on for this theater outing (jeans, sweater, mules) were somehow eye catching, because the roomie was coming in as I was going out and said I looked like I was "on the prowl."   Watch out movie patrons!  :o)  Anyway, I headed over to my most favorite of theaters to take in what I expected to be a good movie.  I was not disappointed with The Terminal.  I had someone tell me that it was hard for them to separate Tom Hanks from the Russian-esque character he is portraying.  I didn't have that problem.  I was amused by and felt for this character.  Stanley Tucci plays a classic pain in the a&& person in charge, and I thought his character should have gotten more of a comeuppance than he did.  Catherine Zeta Jones was stunningly beautiful in a surprisingly realistic female character.  The story was heart-warming, motivating, and honest.   ****ALERT POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD**** What typical Hollywood story nowadays would have the romantic relationship not happen?   The truth, while frustrating, was accurately portrayed.  I think it's very powerful that instead of fitting the mold, Spielberg was able to show a realistic situation.  A beautiful, strong, successful woman "waiting" for an unavailable man. Drawn to, yet unsure of how to react to, the sweet good-natured man who is available and taken with her.  And in the end going back to the jerk because it's what she thinks she wants or deserves.  Powerful.    So I did enjoy this movie, and will probably add it to my DVD collection some day....it will be a good stitch-a-long movie.  Oh, while Hanks gives a great performance as usual, it's not better than Forrest Gump.  ;)  On another review note, I spent some time yesterday skulking about the new JK Rowlings official website ( urlLink www.jkrowling.com ).  For any Harry Potter fan, it's a must visit.  She's got some nifty little clues to extra tidbits, and I appreciate her response to rumors and such.  Very entertaining....now if I can just figure out how to get past that sill brick wall......you'll know what I mean when you visit the site.  Oh yeah....I discovered the hard way last night that I'm not going to be able to leave the cats unattended on the patio anymore...at least not until I get the lattice stuff attached to the lower fence.  Bailey, mischief maker extraordinare got through the temporary blockade.  And of course Chloe followed her.  Luckily they didn't go far and were recaptured quickly.  Hopefully I can have that fixed in the next few days.  It's retirement grand central around Metro today.  Those who took part in the retirement incentive offer are on their last day.  There are lunches and little gatherings most of the day.  I'm working on some document updates, so I'll have my micro-meal at home and enjoy some cake and punch at the department celebration this afternoon.  Have I mentioned recently that I'm SO ready for my vacation next week!?!?!?  :o)

      Okay, I feel really whiney for my post of this morning.  It's overwhelmingly filled with pathetic girlie insecurities and doubts.  Sigh...I'm a girl, guess it's to be expected occassionally.  And I have actually had men interested in me.  Unfortunately the feeling wasn't mutual.  Go figure.  I'm having a busy day at the office with meetings and document updates.  Lots to get done before next weeks vacation.    At this point I'm looking forward to soaking up the sun in my pool on the patio.  Ahhhhhhhh.....the simple things in life.  :o)

      A slightly bizarre, and definitely unexpected, phenomenon is occurring in my brain.  Okay so maybe it's not completely unexpected.  It's strange because of what experience has brought it about.  See I have this roommate.  He's a cool dude that moved in about a month ago.  We each have our own lives, so we don't see each other constantly.  We even occassionally hang out.  I consider us pals.  He can install cat doors and I can teach him about  urlLink Financial Peace  budgeting.  It's a win-win situation.  The strange thing is the overwhelming sense of loneliness I have felt since he moved in.  I never would have imagined that the presence of another human being would cause such a thing.  For the most part, it's not a noticeable presence, this "loneliness."  Other times, it's all encompassing and the world I see around me is through the haze it's created.    Now the frustrating part of this phenomenon, is that I am not typically a sad, depressed, or negative person.  My tendency is to be cheerful, lively, and enthusiastic...yes even when I'm alone.  It's the cheerleader in me I guess (and yes this is a personality aspect that really gets on some peoples nerves).   So for a woman like myself, who is basically cute, somewhat intelligent, career satisfied, a new homeowner, and financially responsible (most of the time), it's sobering and confusing to be consumed by a feeling like loneliness.  I'm surrounded by people all day long.  I have many friends that I love.  And I'm wondering if a part of me is still preoccupied with that bill of goods my generation of little girls got sold by Disney.  You know the one....sweet girl, handsome prince, love everlasting, happily every after.   I wonder if humans really have the capacity to truly love someone not their offspring.  I mean thinking of the marriages I know of, there's exactly 1 that I would call successfull and happy for both people.    And there's the spiritual awareness in me that's going "hey wait a minute...we're not suppose to need someone else to be happy."   To that I say "well, I am happy.  I am a complete human being.  What's so wrong with wanting to share that with someone else?  And is it so wrong to hope that in that supportive, loving, best friend, partner relationship there is great sex?"  Of course I'm unable to answer myself.    This leads to wondering if I'm just expecting too much.  I've been told by friends that I'm high-maintenance or picky.  Is it really too much to ask for an intelligent man, that I have some attraction for, and vice versa?  Is responsibility that hard to come by?   Is it over-zealous to want good conversation and mindless couch cuddling with the same person?  And is there a decent man out that, that isn't attached, that could get past the not-so-perfect exterior to the adorable light that's inside?  I have yet to meet a person or read a book that can provide insight into these questions.  If I believed the magazines and television shows, I'd believe that no man could ever want to be with me until I was a size 2 (which I've never been), had perfect teeth, perfect skin, bigger breasts, a cuter nose, wore skimpy clothes, begged for sex multiple times a day, and didn't ever want to talk about how I felt about anything.  I'm not falling for that one.  I can't believe that we are all so shallow.  Or are we?  So I work, live in my house, and occassionally post an online personal ad to find someone brave enough to meet me for coffee or a drink.  I've met several nice guys.   Some I still talk with every so often.  For the most part, there's no chemistry, no interest, no understanding, and a regret for the time wasted not doing something more entertaining.  I'm not simple or uncomplicated - I'm mulit-faceted.  It's not the easiest thing to be around I suppose.  I'm looking to meet someone that's got depth and isn't just surface - and who can enjoy being around me.   From the present moment, seems like I need to chaulk it up to "not in this lifetime" and be content to become an old woman with 20 cats.  I'm not content with that thought.  So I'll keep living...and occassionally searching....usually always laughing.   It's still confusing though!  :o)

      And even though it's a bit rainy outside, it's not a bad Monday at all.  Helps that it was a fun weekend.  Friday...saw me out and about after work with Betsy, Marsha, Lori, and Margaret.  There were many drinks had on the patio at Chili's.  :o)  Saturday...was a beautiful sunny day...until I went maniac in the kitchen killing flies!!  On such a pretty day, I like to open the back door for the kitties to go out on the patio.  And it seems every fly within a 5-mile radius has radar tuned into my house.  So either the fly killing spree annoyed or freaked out roommate Douglas.   When he couldn't take it anymore, he decided to install  urlLink the cat door .  :o)  It's awesome.   Chloe has taken to it quickly.  Abbie and Bailey are a bit more skeptical.  And once we got the furballs taken care of, Doug and I decided to kick back, watch a movie, and drink adult beverages.  We went through an astonishing amount of vodka.  We were entertaining though.  And if a snore hadn't woken me....we'd probably still be passed out on the couch! (FYI - roommate Douglas makes a very good pillow whether he meant to or not!  LOL LOL LOL) Oh yeah, we watched "50 First Dates" with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore.  Too cute movie!  Sunday....started entirely too early  (damn constructions workers)!!  Aren't they suppose to take Sunday off!?!?!?   Evidently somebody was way too motivated to work, because the heavy machinery started around 7 am.  After the vodka evening I had...it was not a welcome sound.  Surprisingly though, aside from the whole dizziness and having to hold on to the walls, I didn't feel so bad.  It is the first time I've ever woken up the next morning still pretty much drunk!  :o)  Needless to say, I didn't eat much during the day.  Never felt really bad though.  So while Douglas went to Alabama for the day, I lounged around the house doing laundry, stitching on  urlLink Storyteller , watching Sports Night, and just enjoying the day.  And then I was naughty.  :o)   I took a breather outside on the patio to pet Abbie and just enjoy the sunshine.  I realized while I was laying on the lounge chair that with the privacy fence, I could avoid tan lines while I was laying in the sun and not be seen. ***insert devilish grin here*** This made me think of my vacation next week and how much I would love to get rid of my redneck tan lines (I love to drive in the car with the window down and my arm in the sun - thus the creation of the shirt sleeve tan line on one side - I'm not often a passenger, so it's not even), and lounge in the sun listening to books on tape.    So off to Walmart I went.  For $20 I bought one of those inflatable kiddy pools.  I got a grass mat to put under it since my patio is made of the rough concrete.  It's filled with water and the cover is on.  I'm all set for my July 4th vacation by  urlLink the pool !  Which is a good thing since I've spent too much money and won't be able to go out and do anything else until after payday next week!  All in all it was a great weekend!  I expect a busy week at work while as I get things done before going on vacation.  Shouldn't be anything too rowdy though.

      Quote of the day:  "I don't like it when people come over and manhandle my deliverables."  Thanks to Bob for today's quote.  Printer problems and nosey people can be entertaining on a Friday.  So Thursday was definitely better than Wednesday evening.  Work was basically uneventful.  I made good progress on the menu I'm testing for my website.  Joined some work folks for a drink after work - Rachel, one of our way cool consultants, is moving on to bigger and better things, so we took the opportunity to get together.  Congrats Rachel!    And big congratulations go out to roomie Doug!  He finally got to see his score from the final Chiropractic Boards test he to take.  Phew!  That's done, the score was awesome, now onwards and upwards.  As for me and this rainy Friday....looks like we have an all morning meeting.  And I've got a margarita outing with some of the girls.  Other than that, not much is going on.   It's the Annual Stitch Along for Storyteller (Teresa Wentzler cross stitch), so I am planning to get that colorful draggie out for some stitches this weekend.  Nothing else is planned, so there's no telling what will happen.  Happy Friday everybody.  :o)

      Do you ever just suddenly get in a funk, and everything that's not how you want it to be seems that much more awful?   Last night was that way for me.  I got home to my oh so wonderful house, made some notes about updates to my website, ran by the grocery store, cranked wild tunes while making a scrambled egg dinner....and then sat forlornly at my little card table in the dining room while I ate dinner by myself.  I really do detest sitting at a table and eating a meal by myself.  I suppose it's why I've eaten dinner with the television for the past 10 years or more.  It's entirely too much time to think.  Especially when I'm faced with the realization that I am all by myself.  A bit of harsh reality for someone who typically enjoys life and being around others so much.  So last night all the sad pitiful questions, and their mean feeling-sorry-for-myself answers, were floating around in my head.  Sigh....it was pretty pathetic.  As for this morning....well I'm still feeling too fat, not financially successful enough, unsexy, and completely unloveable.   I'm countering that with bright red lipstick and a lime green shirt.....not to mention the anticipation of a margarita outing with some friends this evening.  :o)  Oh...as for the website, well I'm working on that more today.

      Welcome to Melanie's first ever blog post.  Woohoo...better late than never.  The world could be in for something it's not prepared for now that I have this blog.  I have many a soapbox, and do tend to ramble when triggered.  :o)  What you can expect to see her more often than not is an update on my cross stitching, antics of my cats, my reviews of books/cats, or just generalized commentaries on the silly nonsense that goes on in a day.  So, have a fabulous Wednesday and I'll be blogging with you soon.  Melanie

      It's a little strange to be faced with a weekend that has no plans.&nbsp; There is potential for plans.&nbsp; Nothing is certain though.  I'm still walking funny with this hip situation going on.&nbsp; I did manage to get a little cleaning done at the house last night.&nbsp; Actually made it to the mailbox on back, so life is good.&nbsp; :o)&nbsp;&nbsp; It's still pretty uncomfotable.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm hoping the heel lifts I ordered will get here soon.&nbsp; And I'm still trying stretches, though this isn't a pain a stretch is going to help.  And while I'm on that subject....why do medical professionals regard patients as imbeciles?&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not stupid.&nbsp; I have an incredible capacity for learning.&nbsp;&nbsp; So my xrays&nbsp; looked great.&nbsp; No problems there.&nbsp; There is still obviously a problem with my hip.&nbsp; Okay so maybe something is torn or strained or twisted or something.&nbsp; Talk to me about it.&nbsp; Educate me.&nbsp; Enable me to help myself.&nbsp; Don't just stand there and say "well the xray was fine" and offer nothing else.&nbsp; If you don't know what could be causing the pain, then say so.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm one of those people that like to take part in fixing what ails me.&nbsp; So emotional, spiritual, physical, or mental, I want a hand in correcting what's not right.&nbsp; I'm a participant in my life!&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting no answers or guidance from someone I look to for both is frustrating for me.&nbsp; And tends to lead me out to the internet, which can be a scary thing!&nbsp; :o)  Okay so off of that soap box and on to another one.&nbsp; Do people have any idea the impact they have when they exclude?&nbsp; Specifically, when I hear people making lunch plans and inviting everyone around me and NOT inviting me, what message are they sending?&nbsp; Is it intentional?&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they just not thinking?&nbsp; Are they making an assumption?&nbsp; Keep in mind that these people are my co-workers and we have gone to lunch before.&nbsp; Often.&nbsp; We get along just fine.&nbsp; So what is the deal today?&nbsp;&nbsp; I can tell you, being excluded does not support that whole team feeling.  Now for a lighter topic....consider me crazy (many people do)....I really want to see the movie Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle.&nbsp; It seems like a really stupid funny, just for laughs kind of experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I can catch it next weekend.  As for this weekend, with no exercising currently on the agenda, I'm not sure what I'll end up doing.&nbsp; I picked up Messenger by Lois Lowry at the library yesteday, and still have Mort by Terry Pratchett that I borrowed from my friend Scott.&nbsp; If the sun cooperates, it could be a reading while laying out in my pool weekend.  Now I'm going to go home and hang out with the cats for lunch.&nbsp; Here's to a Fantastic Friday for everyone!

      So I had the chiropractor appointment yesterday morning.&nbsp; Hip xray looked fine, keep exercising, and do lots of stretches.&nbsp; I think the thing I forgot to mention to my chiropractor(s) is the fact that the hip pain is constant.&nbsp; It doesn't go away completely.&nbsp; It's worse during walking or when I have to use the left leg as the load bearing leg.  Last night after eating a carb rich dinner of micro meal and chips and salsa, I decided to hit the greenway for a walk.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't get there until about 8pm.&nbsp; Temperature was perfect.&nbsp; Good tunes on the radio.&nbsp; I tried a little bit of stretching before I started on the trail.&nbsp; The hip still hurt of course.&nbsp; My thinking was that the walking would work it out.&nbsp; Then I thought, well if the jogging started it, maybe I just needed to jog a little bit to work it out.&nbsp; I mean it's a slightly different muscle use than the walking.&nbsp; Again I barely made it about 1/4 of a mile.&nbsp; The pain didn't stop.&nbsp; It got worse.&nbsp; And of course the opposite leg ended up with a shin issue.&nbsp;   I couldn't even make it through 1/2 of the greenway before turning around and heading back to the car.&nbsp; It was definitely getting darker at this point, and I had serious concerns about my being able to make it back to my car.&nbsp; I was walking very slowly, limping is more like it, and trying to nurse myself through the pain.&nbsp; When I finally did get back to the car, I cried because actually getting into the driver's seat was excruciating.&nbsp; I drove home crying and cursing my chiropractor.  Now keep in mind that the roomie is sick.&nbsp; He's lost his voice, has a sore throat, and is basically miserable.&nbsp; Has been for a few days now.&nbsp; When I got home he was still sitting on the couch.&nbsp; Me being in pain, I didn't care and wanted to lash out.&nbsp; So I told him that he and the other chiropractor dude could both kiss my ass!&nbsp;&nbsp; Well duh my hip still hurts!!  Just goes to show you that fear can make people do mean things.&nbsp; I went upstairs and tried to do more stretching and soaked in the tub.&nbsp; At this point I'm pretty sure that if it's not a hip joint issue, it's a torn ligament/muscle issue.&nbsp; It's not a good tight muscle pain.&nbsp; It's a bad something wrong pain.&nbsp; I'm scared.&nbsp; I can't afford for anything for anything to be wrong.&nbsp; And of course I'm kicking myself for not taking better care of myself.  I did apologize to my roomie for being such a bitch.&nbsp; I felt bad about that.&nbsp; He waved it off.&nbsp;   The thing I'm frustrated with, is it seems I'm being rushed through the office too much.&nbsp; I go in, Doc spends maybe 30 seconds talking/listening to my pain issues, doesn't ask more questions, adjusts me, and sends me on my way.&nbsp; There's no time for a better dialog to get to the heart of what's going on.&nbsp; I feel like I'm a waste of time because they can't make enough money on me.&nbsp; It doesn't feel like they care about me as a patient.&nbsp; I've seriously thought about going somewhere else.&nbsp; If my financial situation was different, I would have already.  So instead, I've done some self diagnosing.&nbsp; My first chiropractor (back in Charlotte) had put me in some heel lifts due to&nbsp;a leg length discrepency.&nbsp; I saw him maybe once a quarter after the initial treatment phase.&nbsp; I felt great.&nbsp; I went online last night and ordered me some heel lifts, they are actually a little more affordable than I thought they would be.&nbsp; Check out the site if you're interested.....  urlLink http://www.gwheellift.com .&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully I'll have them next week.&nbsp;   It doesn't make the pain go away now.&nbsp; It's something though.&nbsp; I'm about action.&nbsp; I want to participate in the fixing of me.&nbsp; Missy can attest to that!&nbsp; :o)&nbsp; I'll be taking it easy over the next several days.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means I'm probably going to put back on the 5 lbs. I lost.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course it may also mean that I get some cross stitching done, so Melissa will be glad of that.  You know what hurts worse?&nbsp; Knowing there is no one to comfort me.&nbsp; No one to rub my back or give me a hug just because.&nbsp; No one to ask if I need anything from the store.&nbsp; I've heard the idea that men don't like women who are too independent.&nbsp; What choice have I had?&nbsp; I'm the only one around to take care of me.&nbsp; It couldn't be avoided.&nbsp; Isn't life ironic that way?  Oh yeah....I finished the Five People book last night.&nbsp; Powerful.&nbsp; Beautiful.&nbsp; Gives me something to look forward to.

      ....that you never know how a day is going to turn out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is a prime example of that.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an absolutely perfect summer day.&nbsp; A beautiful breeze, a clear blue sky.&nbsp; Humans are meant to be outdoors on a day like today.  My day started off pretty well.&nbsp; I got some good sleep last night.&nbsp; Even got to sleep in a bit since I was going to the chiropractor this morning.&nbsp; They don't open until 9, so I had a bit of a lie in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Doug the roommate helped me get started with the xrays.&nbsp; I've had a hip concern over the past several days.&nbsp; There is pain that hasn't gone away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it started with me trying to do a bit of jogging, it made me wonder if there was a joint issue going on.&nbsp; And with my mother having had a hip replacement at 42, I didn't want to risk it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The xrays look fine.&nbsp; There may be some minor calcium deposits, however they are not where they would be causing friction or pain.&nbsp; Diagnosis is continued exercise and more hip stretches.  I finally got to work a little after 10 this morning.&nbsp; I knew it would be a busy day for me since I've got a meeting tomorrow afternoon and the final requirements are going to be reviewed with the customer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I brought in leftover pizza and geared up for a busy day at the computer.  What is it, about certain things that just makes you aware of them at odd times?&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is my father's birthdate.&nbsp; If he were alive he would have been 57 today.&nbsp; We were not close, my father and I.&nbsp; I've thought on occassion since his death that he really missed out by not knowing me better.&nbsp; Maybe that's what brought tears to my eyes today.&nbsp; That and the potential that I may have missed out by not knowing him better.&nbsp; Whatever the reason, 10 years after his death and I am a bit raw with emotion today.&nbsp; Go figure.  The more I think about it, the more I attribute my raw feelings to the book I started listening to last night.&nbsp; It is "The Five People You Meet In Heaven" by Mitch Albom.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a story with purpose.&nbsp; It's very moving.&nbsp; I've actually started taking some notes.&nbsp; Here are the things that have struck me so far:   Strangers are just family you haven't gotten to know yet.  No life is wasted.   The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone.&nbsp;    We are all connected.  The 1st lesson - There are no random occurrances.  Courage is often confused with picking up arms (weapons)....cowardice is often confused with putting them down.  The 2nd lesson - Sacrifice is a part of life.&nbsp; It is not something to regret.&nbsp; It is something to asipre to.&nbsp; Sometimes when you sacrifice something precious, you are not losing it, you are simply passing it on.  All parents damage their children.&nbsp; It cannot be helped.&nbsp; Some smudge, some crack, some shatter.   These were powerful statements to me.&nbsp; Especially the one about being alone.&nbsp; It's definitely a reminder to be more aware of my thoughts.  Of course even words that powerful don't keep me from putting my foot in my mouth!&nbsp;&nbsp; I actually told Casandra today just not to tell me anything because I'm to capable of doing something stupid like alluding to the knowledge in front of people I shouldn't.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; It's bizarre to me how some knowledge&nbsp;I keep so hidden so well, and other knowledge just seems to fall out of my mouth.&nbsp; Talk about feeling like I have a screw loose.  On a completely different note, I saw a prime example of the difference between men communicating and women communicating.&nbsp; At the chiropractor's office this morning, I was talking to a friend of mine.&nbsp; She's adorable and always puts a lot of effort into her appearance.&nbsp; She still looked cute this morning, however it was evident she didn't spend a lot of time on her hair or else she was just having a bad hair day.&nbsp; I thought this, though I didn't say anything to her about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few minutes later the doc walks up and is chatting.&nbsp; He looked my friend in the face and said "what's up with the do today&nbsp;- why the flat hair?"&nbsp; :o)&nbsp;&nbsp; What was the point of that?&nbsp;&nbsp; If she was having a bad day, that would have just crushed her mood even more.&nbsp; He may have been trying to joke.&nbsp; I'm not sure.&nbsp; I just couldn't help thinking he was a clod.  There are just a couple more things I want to mention before closing out today's post.......  First, in my eagerness to impart the tales from my weekend, I failed to mention the kudos awarded to me and my coworkers on Monday.&nbsp; We were asked to a senior management meeting and presented with certificates of recognition for work we did on a recent project.&nbsp; It was really cool!&nbsp;&nbsp; I just love our director and assitant director of finance.&nbsp; The certificate is hanging in my cubicle above my monitor.&nbsp; Gotta love being acknowledge for your hard work.  The other thing I want to mention is stem cell research.&nbsp; I'm potentially leaving myself open for a lot of character attacks if strangers read this.&nbsp; It can't be helped, because I want to share some information I found today.&nbsp; There is a lot of political and religious squabbling.&nbsp; The thing that bugs me about that, is the fact that this type of research as a whole is being bad mouthed.&nbsp;   From the little bit of research I've done, I've found that there are two basic types of stem cell research.&nbsp; Embryonic and Adult.&nbsp; There have been some successess in treating diabetes with adult stem cells.&nbsp; It's the embryonic part that is controversial.&nbsp; Stem cell research as a whole IS NOT A BAD THING.&nbsp; I disagree with those who would speak that opinion out of ignorance and the narrow understanding of what a few researches do.&nbsp; They don't take live babies and kill them to do embryonic research!&nbsp;&nbsp; And as it turns out, they seem to be experiencing more success with the adult stem cell research at this stage.&nbsp; So it's nothing to condemn out of ignorance.&nbsp;   Okay, I'm done with my soap box for the day.&nbsp; I have yet to determine what I'm going to do with my afternoon.&nbsp; I want to walk on my greenway, though I'm too drained to do that with company.&nbsp; I may just go home and do yoga.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know yet.  Happy hump day everybody.&nbsp; And here's hoping Doogie has fun at the Curiosa concert tonight!&nbsp; :o)  &nbsp;

      Something that disappoints me.....is seeing a good looking man smoking.&nbsp; I was walking into the office this morning and a very nice looking man was puffing away.&nbsp; It was a shame.&nbsp; He had gorgeous eyes - at least I think he did.&nbsp; Who can tell through all that smoke.&nbsp; ;)  Something that sparks my curiosity....is  urlLink www.shareyourexperiences.com .&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidently a few people are trying to scope out information about me.&nbsp; They know my e-mail address and that's how they are posting on that site to find out details about me.&nbsp; It costs too much to join, so I haven't been able to do much investigatin.&nbsp; And I'm wondering if it's just a spam type lure.&nbsp; If anyone knows anything about this site, I'd love to hear some details about it.&nbsp; Or if you know who is trying to scope me out, I'd love to hear about that too!!&nbsp;   Something that tempts me....is my roomie stretched out on the couch watching a movie.&nbsp; Especially after we've eaten a big meal.&nbsp; I want to go over there and stretch out next to him.&nbsp; What is it about the comfort of just laying on the couch next to someone?&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it's just that.&nbsp; The comfort.&nbsp; I like the activity I'm bringing into my life.&nbsp; I just wish I had more of the lounging on the couch with someone going on in my life.  Something that gives me hope...is having a crush on someone that complimented me yesterday.&nbsp; Well call him Mr. S.&nbsp; He's an adorable guy who works for another department.&nbsp; We were in a class together earlier this year.&nbsp; He's got a Chicago accent, sparkling blue eyes, a warm smile, and a very laid back personality.&nbsp;&nbsp; He works in a different building than I do, and I've seen him maybe 3 times since we finished class.&nbsp; We were in a meeting together yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; We were chatting together with a co-worker of mine.&nbsp; I managed to invite him to a party she hasn't even scheduled yet!&nbsp; :o)&nbsp;&nbsp; He did&nbsp;say he liked&nbsp;my hair.&nbsp; So here's to hoping there is some interest and a potential date in there somewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm tempted to just be forward and call him at home.&nbsp; How do men feel about women asking them out anyway!?!?!  There is lots of work to be done today.&nbsp; I'm still in sleep recovery mode after my lack of zzz's this weekend.&nbsp; May have to get some coffee.

      Okay....So my weekend was wild by Melanie standards.&nbsp; It was definitely non-stop activity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday evening the roomie and I hung out.&nbsp; We did "the Walmart run" that happens for me every payday, rented some movies, got shrimp for dinner, and pina colada fixins at the liquor store.   Movies of choice were:&nbsp; Bad Santa (the Badder Santa unrated version), Rundown, and Along Came Polly.&nbsp; Let me just say that Bad Santa is a riot!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't make it through Rundown.&nbsp; It looked like it had potential, however after several pina colada's I was bored and couldn't focus.&nbsp; I ended up going out with a new friend and talking until like 2:00 in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; FYI - airport observation parking lot is just a cool place to hang out.   So Saturday comes along and I had a date to meet someone for coffee.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which I did.&nbsp; Nice enough guy.&nbsp; Turns out he's old enough to be my father!!&nbsp; :o)&nbsp;&nbsp; I've actually put him in e-mail contact with my mother.&nbsp; I think they might have a lot in common.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp;&nbsp;   After sitting and chatting for an hour or so, I was itching to be outside to do something.&nbsp; So I went back home and gathered up the roomie.&nbsp; We went to play putt putt.&nbsp; I won...Won't tell you by how much in order to protect the roomie's ego.&nbsp; Since he likes to play pool, and is not familiar with all the places to do that, we went and shot some pool.&nbsp; Okay, he shot pool and I learned how to at least hit the ball!&nbsp; :o)&nbsp; It was a lot of fun and something I see myself spending time doing....Like the batting cage and driving range thing.&nbsp; I'm really into this being active thing!   Turns out that while I was having coffee Saturday morning, the roomie got a call from his ex-girlfriend.&nbsp; Turns out she is getting married.&nbsp; So he was in a reflective, mostly venting mood on Saturday.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why indeed do people do that?&nbsp;&nbsp; Make that "I'm getting married" call to the former spouse or former girl/boy friend?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it closure, revenge, or just FYI?&nbsp; The scary thing I realized while he was talking (venting) about things, is the similarities between his ex and me.&nbsp; The primary differences are big.&nbsp; There are just some underlying things that she and I appear to have in common.&nbsp; It must really freak him out sometimes.&nbsp; Anyway, after leaving the pool hall we headed back to the house to lounge on the couch and watch Along Came Polly.&nbsp; Cute movie.   While doing that, I ended up with a dinner date....After turning down a movie date.&nbsp;&nbsp; And here is where the entertaining portion of this post begins, because it turned into one of those dates from hell!!   I went to pick up my date, we'll call him Mr. C, because he had been drinking by the pool during the day.&nbsp; Here is where you should know that I thought this was just being responsible on his part.&nbsp; I didn't mind because I'd rather not risk the whole drunk driving thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway...So I went to pick up Mr. C at his new apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp; We chatted a bit, I checked out his new computer.&nbsp; Everything seemed fine, and I didn't notice any behavior out&nbsp;of the ordinary.&nbsp;&nbsp;We headed to the Green Hills Grille for dinner.&nbsp; Interesting note.....I'm wearing a red sweater, dressy black slacks, and high-heeled black sandals.......Mr. C is wearing khaki shorts, a golf shirt, and sports shoes.&nbsp; Always helpful to coordinate wardrobe before an outing.&nbsp; I felt over-dressed.   So we arrive at GHG and start the parking challenge.&nbsp; Parking is horrible of course, I don't want to have to pay the valet (and Mr. C didn't offer), so he suggests parking in a spot marked for another restaurant.&nbsp; I don't really like this idea, however I went along with it anyway.&nbsp; No sooner did we get inside GHZ and head for the bar than the valet dude at the other restaurant was tapping Mr. C on the shoulder to move his car.&nbsp; Well of course it's my car, so I have to go out and figure out where on God's green earth I'm going to park!&nbsp;&nbsp;   After finding a safe place (posted that parking is okay after 6pm) to park, I went back in and joined Mr. C at the bar for the martini I had requested.&nbsp;&nbsp; We chatted with a couple sitting next to us, and it looked like things would go well.&nbsp;&nbsp; We got seated at our table and were chatting away.&nbsp; At the moment I can't remember what about.&nbsp; It turned into a question of my interest/attraction for him.&nbsp; He admitted his attraction for me (several times).&nbsp; Before answering him, we placed our orders with the Jaime the waiter.&nbsp;   That's when the first ugh hit.&nbsp; I like to know the name of the person serving me food.&nbsp; It allows me to address them by name and just be polite.&nbsp; Mr. C is from Canada, so I don't know if that AND the alcohol impacted his statement to the waiter or not.&nbsp; All I remember is the statement "and don't make it cold because I'm a dick."&nbsp;&nbsp; Before this, Jaime was pleasant and smiling.&nbsp; After this Jaime could barely stand to be anywhere near our table.   So in wording my response to Mr. C, I told him I thought he could be interesting, I thought he was slightly attractive, and that it was too early for me to form an opinion one way or another about any kind of emotional attachment or desire to jump into the sack.&nbsp; I did tell him that I was turned off by the intoxication.&nbsp; See, after sitting down at the table (I sat across from him), it became clear to me that he could barely keep his eyes open.&nbsp; He was practically having to hold himself up.&nbsp; He had ordered us both a martini at the bar, and I'll admit to having concerns about him ordering himself another one.&nbsp; And when I mentioned it, he did say that he had put on his profile "drinks excessively."&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh lord.   And there I sat, trying to keep myself entertained, and him talking so he wouldn't pass out.&nbsp; A family was seated next to us, at a rather close proximity I must say, and I was mortified at his language.&nbsp; The young daughter was practically sitting at our table and Mr. C had no problem letting slip words and topics that were not appropriate.&nbsp; And of course I asked him to watch his language out of courtesy, and what does he do?&nbsp; Get short with me for treating him like an imbecile when I said "please, please."&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, and then he makes the statement that I look "deliciously beautiful" and returned to talking about 2 previous relationships that ended with the women telling him he was a jerk (hmmmm.....Wonder why).&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of that part of the discussion, he mentioned that the only thing keeping him from dating me seriously was the fact that he was still in love with one of those women!!&nbsp; :)) LOL...LOL....LOL   All I can think to myself at this point is, please God get me out of here.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I start Mr. C talking about his family.&nbsp; Oh God - what a mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp; He got on the topic of his sisters not speaking to him.&nbsp; And he doesn't understand why.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brace yourself for this.....He started crying.&nbsp; Yep, all broken up over the sisters not talking to him, determined it must be because they don't like men and he's a man, and he teared up and cried.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point I'm thinking he needs to check out AA and a really good therapist, because at 42 I'm thinking he should have worked through this stuff by now (I know, I'm harsh).   He finally paid the check...That the waiter had left sitting on the edge of the table like 20 minutes prior....And we left.&nbsp;&nbsp; The brainless twit had the audacity to start rubbing his hand up my thigh as we were driving down the road!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I told him I would rather he didn't do that.&nbsp; I thought we were going for coffee, and mentioned Starbucks which we had to pass on the way back to his house.&nbsp; He said he really didn't drink coffee, said he didn't think this was working out, and suggested I take him home.&nbsp; I did not have a problem with that and was immensely relieved when he got out of the car!!   Lucky for me, not so lucky for the roommate, he was home when I got back to the house.&nbsp; I got a hug of comfort for a horrible date, he got entertained by a bad date story, and then I practically begged him to go out and do something with me.&nbsp; I mean he WAS still mopey from the whole ex-girlfriend phone call thing (he ended up calling and leaving her a message that he was happy for her yada yada yada).&nbsp;&nbsp; So he got ready and we went to Silverado's.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it is the most redneck place to be in the city of Nashville on a Saturday night.&nbsp; The music is loud and the dancing is cool.&nbsp; Oh, and they have really cheap beer prices until&nbsp;11.   So we hit the bar to grab a drink and then parked it along the dance floor rail to watch the crowd.&nbsp; I SO want to learn the country dances!!&nbsp; It looked so much fun.&nbsp; I'm scoping out dance lessons in the area because of that.&nbsp; The hip-hop/rock music started up around 11:30.&nbsp; Sweet roomie was awesome and hit the dance floor with me for Yeah by Usher!!&nbsp;&nbsp; When the classic Push It started we took a breather.&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting at the bar for tequila shots, one of roomie's favorite songs started, so we went out and danced a slow number (he only stepped on my foot once).&nbsp; :o)   A couple dances and a couple tequila shots later, we hit the pool tables.&nbsp; We got in a couple games before roomie had one last beer and we headed for home.&nbsp; Of course, he was still nursing the ex girlfriend call, so we went by Krogers for comfort food.....shrimp, pina colada mix, and Ben & Jerry's.....all of which were finished off (okay not the pina colada mix) while we vegged on the couch and watched Animal House (okay we flipped back and forth between that and Terminator).   Roomie was good and passed out by 2.&nbsp; I was a little antsy, so got online to check e-mail.&nbsp; Had an IM from Mr. C letting me know that I had looked beautiful and he hoped I would find what I was looking for and started chatting with the friend I went out with Friday night...we'll call him Mr. R.&nbsp; Mr. R is just a cool guy and was amused by my bad date story.&nbsp; He ended up coming over and hanging out for a few hours.   Needless to say I didn't get much sleep Saturday night/Sunday morning.&nbsp; I think R left around 6, and I was back up and drinking coffee at 10.&nbsp; I helped the roomie work on some budget stuff, and then we went to Brad & Dena's to grill out.&nbsp; Brad rocks doing steaks on the grill.&nbsp; With baked potatoes and grilled corn on the cob, it was an excellent meal.&nbsp; Before dinner we hung out and were entertained by young master Brandon and the sweet miss Autumn.&nbsp; I whipped up on Dena and the roomie while playing Uno!!!&nbsp; Oh, and the roomie discovered a great appreciation for watching Disney movies from recliner.   And if he's willing to wait about 12 years, the roomie has a ready made bade in Autumn.&nbsp; She hugged on him all through dinner and afterwards.&nbsp; It was too cute.&nbsp;   So, needless to say it was a very full weekend.&nbsp; Which probably complicated this morning.&nbsp; I set the alarm last night, just didn't turn it on.&nbsp; Boy was I snoozing good when the roomie woke up around 8 and started making noise.&nbsp; There's nothing like starting the day yelling a full-throated F*&K!!&nbsp; Amazingly enough, I made it to work by 8:45 and made my 9 a.m. meeting.&nbsp; And some how I've managed to stay awake during the day, though I will admit that my work accomplishments leave a little to be desired.&nbsp; Hey, at least I voted and provided the world with an interesting blog entry!!   Happy Monday everyone!

      I realize I've been remiss in my blog posting duties.&nbsp; Sometimes, there is just no making sense of the mental processes.  This morning wasn't quite as entertaining as yesterday.&nbsp; The roomie locked his keys in the house yesterday, so I had to leave work, go back to the house, and let him in so he could go to work.&nbsp; So glad I'm not the only one susceptible to blonde moments.&nbsp; Anyway, it was a good morning - I look pretty in pink today.  There was something that bugged me on my drive in today.&nbsp; This man came barrelling out of nowhere and cut me off at a stop light.&nbsp; Then, when the intersection was cleared, he just proceeded right along.&nbsp; Did I forget to mention that THE LIGHT WAS STILL RED!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought the guy was a real jerk.&nbsp; Evidently the police officer proceeding through the next light ahead of him didn't even notice.&nbsp; Sigh.  Anyway, there has been some work going on today.&nbsp; I've been working on a business requirements document.&nbsp; Lots of information to impart in a short period of time.&nbsp; And I'm not all together focused on it.&nbsp;   I feel like my time has been stolen away from me.&nbsp; It's my own fault really.&nbsp; Between meeting lots of people and spending lots of time walking on the greenways, I feel like I have no sit down time.&nbsp; I haven't spend an evening on my couch cross stitching and/or watching television in ages.&nbsp; I miss being able to sit still.  The online dating process is exhausting.&nbsp; Checking messages, sending e-mails, trading instant messages, and scheduling "meet n greets."&nbsp;&nbsp; It's funny that the times I wish I had someone to go out and do something with seem few and far between when it turns into all my time spent searching for someone to be with!&nbsp;&nbsp; Guess it's just one of those bizarre life things.  And I had a male friend make the statement to me last night that women "want what they can't have" in response to my question of why the men we are attracted to aren't attracted to us.&nbsp; I think I got a bit uppity in my response to him.&nbsp; The statement just seems like a cop out to me.&nbsp; For example, I'm attracted to a male friend.&nbsp; I asked him last week if we would be interested in sex on a regular basis.&nbsp; My only reason for asking this question was because we have had sex together on 2 occassions, and it was good.&nbsp; My thinking is, we're friends, and the sex is good, who wouldn't want to do that more frequently.&nbsp; I was turned down.&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; I'm not pining away for him.&nbsp; I still like him and think he's attractive.&nbsp; I've been given the impression that he still thinks I'm attractive.&nbsp; It hasn't stopped me from seeking out someone else to spend time with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes I was embarrassed and felt foolish after asking.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm still friends with him.&nbsp; Nuf said.  The attraction I'm talking about is so much more than just looks.&nbsp; Another example.&nbsp; I've meet 5 men recently.&nbsp; All of them nice.&nbsp; Each not grotesque looking.&nbsp; Great conversations.&nbsp; Only 1 has the potential of being an "attractant" and all indications are he's attracted to me.&nbsp; I guess the big difference between men and women is that (and I'm using my roomie as a reference), when men meet a woman in person, they are driven entirely by looks.&nbsp; If her butts too big, it doesn't matter how good the conversation is, she's not interested.&nbsp; Where as I, using myself as the female example, have met and had great conversations with several men.&nbsp; Dispite not being attracted to them all, I don't have a problem with continued conversations and potential friendships.  I'm rambling.&nbsp; It's just something that bugged me.  The thing really bugging me this afternoon is food.&nbsp; I've got crazy munchies and feel like I could eat 24/7 and still not get enough food.&nbsp;&nbsp; CD says it's cause my metabolism is turned up because of the exercise.&nbsp; It's a good thing....except for this whole wanting to eat more side affect!&nbsp; That's the reason I'm having to exercise every day to begin with!!&nbsp; :o)  Someday, I'm hoping to get back to stitching.&nbsp; I miss stitching.&nbsp; I miss having all the time to stitch.  I'm going to walk now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm thinking Sonic for dinner!!

      An update on the eye sight issue I talked about last week.&nbsp; In an attempt to compensate for the over-convergence thing going on with my eyes, Walter (Dr. Choate to those who haven't been going to him for 16 years now) has put me in a bifocal contact lens.&nbsp; Yes, I'm feeling old as the hills.&nbsp; Since I'm not a candidate for the muscular surgery (eyes are not actually crossing, just working like they are), we have to adjust and compensate for the over-convergence in order to prevent the double vision. &nbsp; So, these new lenses have the distance correction I need, and a little bit of reading assistance.&nbsp; I'm trying to adjust.&nbsp; The right eye is not as sharp as it was.&nbsp; I'm not having double vision either, so that's good.&nbsp; I go back in a few weeks for a check up and a further plan of attack.&nbsp; I'll keep you posted. &nbsp; Which brings me to the laws of attraction.&nbsp; Even with the new lenses, my ability to see a person and feel/or not feel an attraction factor hasn't changed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where does it start?&nbsp; Is attraction learned as we grow up, or are we born with an instinct for what's pleasing to our eyes?&nbsp; What maks a person that upon initial meeting is simply plain, and later becomes an attractant?&nbsp; Are we wrong to keep searching for that image that sparks our passion?&nbsp; Or is it better to get to know someone and let the attraction build? &nbsp; And why is it that for the most part the people attracted to us, we are not attracted to in return?&nbsp; And do the "beautiful people" have depth of soul and character? &nbsp; I ramble on this topic because of the men I've met lately, none has sparked my attraction.&nbsp; They have all been very nice.&nbsp; Easy to talk to....okay I could talk to a light post.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's just no giddy excitement.&nbsp; You know what I'm talking about.&nbsp; The kind that makes you smile a lot, and all "shaky/tingly" on the inside.&nbsp; While I think I've got the potential for some good friends, I don't feel drawn to anyone as a potential lover.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 2 men I would like to imagine kissing a lot - neither one of them is interested in me.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; It's aggrevating. &nbsp; I wonder if I'm looking for too much.&nbsp; I wonder if I'm just being shallow.&nbsp; Okay so I'm not being as shallow as the roommate...he won't even hang out with the women if their butt is too big.....I'll at least still go hiking or to a movie with the guys.&nbsp; I'd like to look forward to spending some time with someone....not just resigned to "it's better than hanging out by myself."&nbsp;&nbsp; When I'm like that, it really is better to hang out by myself. &nbsp; So I'm continuing to meet and talk to new people.&nbsp; Hoping to meet the next person to make me gulp and my heart to skip a beat.&nbsp; I think Mr. B set a bad precedence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it too much to ask that I meet another great love of my life!?!?!?&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      It's a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I came straight home from the theater to post a review before heading out to the greenway trail for some exercise.&nbsp; It's going to be quick. &nbsp; I,ROBOT ROCKS!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; So far definitely the best movie of the summer. &nbsp; It's a cross between Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and a Roller Coaster ride.&nbsp; All with Will Smith.&nbsp; And can I just say thank you for the butt shot!!!&nbsp; :o) &nbsp; The movie was just excellent.&nbsp; Early on it seemed the story line was going to follow a predictable path...nope.&nbsp; Okay, Casandra probably would have seen it coming.....but the rest of us "normal" people would and did get a pleasant little twist at the end.&nbsp; Nothing major - definitely some added entertainment though. &nbsp; I will definitely be seeing this movie again.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it's a must have for the DVD collection. &nbsp; Oh, and for those of you looking for Oscar caliber performances and story lines to challenge even Tolkien.....lighten up...it's a summer action movie and it exceeds those expectations!&nbsp; ;)

      What a difference a day makes.&nbsp; Yesterday was pretty rough with being tired and having eye issues.&nbsp; I got my greenway walking in&nbsp; and got to sleep early.&nbsp; I'm feeling better.&nbsp; I've also scheduled an appointment with my eye doctor for Monday morning. &nbsp; The eye issue is an over-convergence thing that has been causing occassional double vision.&nbsp; The occassional part has gone by the wayside this week.&nbsp; It's almost constant when I'm at work or in meetings, and it's making me a little nauseous.&nbsp; Sigh...potential fixes are constant eye glasses or surgery.&nbsp; We'll know for sure Monday. &nbsp; I had a great conversatioin with a guy online last night.&nbsp; He's someone I met via Yahoo personals.&nbsp; We haven't met in person yet - that's coming Saturday.&nbsp; It's nice to chat with someone who can appreciate the off-beat things I do.....Babylon 5, euchre, Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.&nbsp; We've had some really great IM conversations, so I'm looking forward to meeting him Saturday night.&nbsp; I'll keep you posted. &nbsp; Today's funny.....I went to put on my new pair of jeans this morning.&nbsp; Haven't worn them yet.&nbsp; As it turns out, I won't be wearing them at all.&nbsp; One leg is at least 2" longer than the other.&nbsp; I got them at Walmart - they're not suppose to be irregular!&nbsp; :o)&nbsp; I'm taking them back this afternoon.&nbsp; So the weird jeans thing left me with having to wear a skirt today.&nbsp; Haven't worn a skirt in ages....and it's jeans Friday.&nbsp; May not be the most relaxed and comfortable.....at least I look cute!

      ...and you still might feel like a fool.   They say it's better to take the risk.  I wonder about that.  I've got a good friend in my life.  He and I talk about most anything and have fun hanging out.  We've shared a couple intimate moments.  We are both aware enough to know that those moments were pretty darn good.   So, bucking myself up to be brave and go for it, I posed the question to him "what's the possibility that you would be interested in having sex with me on a regular basis?"  Needless to say I struck him speechless.  He was taken aback enough to laugh.  We are both either dating other people, or online searching for an other people to date in my case.  I think he was hoping it was a joke.  Of course it wasn't.  His concern is that sex on a regular basis would result in caring more and becoming more attached.  We are pretty much not the others ideal.   And we've got a good friendship going, so why ruin that.  I made the point of telling him that nobody ever liked me more or got more attached to me by having sex with me.  And we're friends convenient to each other.  It's just sex right?  Boy did I feel like a fool.  Talk about getting offline as fast as possible and hiding in my room.  And I cried over it.   Cried my eyes out.  Scared because I don't want to mess up a good friendship, humiliated at the rejection, and angry for being used a couple times before.  Talk about wishing you could take a conversation back!  Of course I tossed and turned over it all night last night.  Got to work before 8:00 because I was sleeping so bad.  I feel like I've been hit by a truck this morning.  Hopefully a good yoga workout this evening will help set me to feeling right again.  Speaking of workouts....like that segway......I walked the greenway again last night.  Then after a quick stop back at the house for the walkman, I went back and hit the track at McGavock.  In total I probably got 3 miles in last night.  It felt good to wear myself out.  I'm still sore from the batting and golfing Tuesday night.  That's why I'm thinking yoga for tonight.  The stretching will help work out the rest of the soreness.   And a really cool thing.....after weeks of bouncing between 193 and 200....the scale said 190 this morning!!!  I'm psyched.  As for stitching....there's been none.  I don't feel settled enough to sit down and focus on it.  I don't know when I'm going to get back to it either.  I'm having an eye issue that is concerning me and I think it's part of the reason I'm not stitching.  I'll keep you posted on that.  On the work front....it's gotten very busy for me.  I'm working extra again as we kick up the analysis phase of a new project.  Lots to be done in a short time.   It's fun!  So Seal IV is cranking in the earbuds and I'm going to get back to working away.  Here's to Thursday.  Mel  Update to this post....we've IM'd this morning....my friend and I.  He said no worries, the question didn't make him uncomfortable.  Sigh of relief.  To be honest, there's some disappointment here too.  It would have been a lot of fun on a regular basis.  Ce la vie...more fun for the next lucky stud-muffin that comes into my life!  ;)

      Okay, so I'm seem to be going through a phase of being extra active and learning new things.  So, over the past couple of days, I have hit the driving range and the batting cage.  That may not seem like a lot to some people.  For me however, it's pretty major.  The thing to know, is that as a child I was riddiculed and made fun of for my lack of athletic talent.  I had no understanding or comfort level with any sport.  I was always picked last for a team.  Always.  And when it came time to play, I was petrified of making a fool of myself.  Talk about shakey and nervous.  So at 34, I've finally realized I'm over it.  :o)  It doesn't matter how good or bad I am, just that I try.  So with my pal Casandra's help, I'm hitting golf balls and smacking softballs.  And yes, I have actually hit a few.  AND I'M TICKLED PINK!!!   Yes it will take some effort on my part to improve my swings and get comfortable in the activity.  It's worth it.  Last night was cool, because it felt good to hit those softballs with the bat.  And then roomie Doug and I went to hit some more golf balls.  It's amazing the difference a shorter club (I'm only 5'4") and a tee can make.  I actually got the balls up in the air and further than 75 yards!  I'm loving my new adventures, and plan to add them to my list of fun things.  Next paycheck I'm hitting the go carts.  Never done that before either.  Look out Dale jr!  Roomie Doug is going through a bunch of change in his life with the finishing school, getting his doctors license, practicing at a new office, and getting his life back on track.  We spend a lot of time talking.  Okay, he talks and I do a lot of listening.  I do throw in some thoughts every so often.  On one side, I envy him his plethora of options.  On the other side, I wouldn't want to be faced with so many choices.  He's definitely got a lot to think about, so my new found sports interest will hopefully keep him entertained while he figures out where he wants to go with his life next.   It feels good to be able to support someone and to be there when they need to talk.  As for me, well I'm back to the online dating thing.  Am chatting with a few people.  One has good potential.  Of course I've already had 2 coffee dates for this week scheduled and cancelled.  The 3rd one has been scheduled for Saturday, so we'll see if it makes it.  I'm still pondering that loneliness issue.  It's not as strong or overwhelming for me right now.  Still a small thought in the back of my mind though.  Work has seen some changes.  One of our lead developer guys is going to work in another office.  It's brought up some team communication issues that we need to work through.  I still feel really good about the work we are doing and the things we are accomplishing.  Right now it feels like everyone is getting along better, and we are doing greater things than we have since I've been here.  It's a great thing to experience.  On the totally not deep and thought provoking front, After a day of 105 degree temperatures (that's what the thermostat in Rex's car said at lunch), Nashville had some freaky weather move through last night.  High winds and electricity outings before the rain even hit.  Very bizarre.  All my peoples are okay thankfully.  On the completely shallow front....my fingernails are looking really great and I haven't broken a one in all the batting and golfing activity.  I do believe they'll end up with a french manicure before the week is out.  :)  I'm off to a quick lunch and an all afternoon meeting.    Happy Wednesday!

      Good morning all.   I'm back at work, and of course wishing I was still on vacation.  Time really does fly when you are having fun.  It was a challenge to get up this morning.  It will probably take me a few days to get back into the swing of things.  The vacation was good.  Saw a couple movies, got some sun, had some sex, ate good food, and did some lounging around.   Of course I did a bunch of running around errands wise too.   And my roommates addiction to the Yahoo personals got me motivated to post another ad.  So I'm back online looking for love.  Sigh.  Feels a little pathetic.  My brain is a bit fuzzy this morning.  I have nothing of interest to expound upon.  So, I'm going to leave it here and will be back to reflect as necessary.  Happy Monday!  :o)

      Happy Independence Day America!     I've just gotten back from watching Nashville's fireworks.  Sat in the fenced parking lot at work and listened to the symphony on the radio.  It was awesome.   And a bit sad.  See, I love fireworks.  They are just so beautiful and amazing.  I absolutely adore the symphony.  The first cords I hear give me chills.   Combine the two, and it's heavenly.   The sad part of this evening was sitting in my car to watch and listen all by myself.  Of course, it's not as bad as sitting in the middle of a crowd all by myself.   My dream, hence my goal, is to be front and center next year.  Sitting on a cozy blanket, with a full picnic basket, a couple really good bottles of wine (or if in a public park and cooler jug full of some yummy adult beverage), and in the company of a man who adores me.....or at the very least in the company of some friends who enjoy fireworks as much as I do.  I love being an American.  I love living in the United States.  There is a church I pass everyday going to and from work.  The sign this week says "don't use your freedom as a rationale for sinning" and every time I see it, I want to change it to read "DO USE YOUR FREEDOM AS A RATIONALE FOR SINGING."   A much more appreciative sentiment in my opinion.  We Americans take so much for granted, and we have the freedom to do so.  We can say what we want, when we want to.  We can eat all the junk food we can stand.  A single woman can buy a house all by herself.  And we have so many occassions to celebrate - and we make up more every year!  Ya know, I think it would be cool to have a wedding on July 4th - I mean think about it, a pretty dress, cake, and fireworks....it's cool!  :O)  Anyway....I've had a basically uneventful weekend.  Missed the amusement of the roomie - he actually just got home early and I'm awaiting camping stories.  Rented a few movies - Paycheck, Cheaper By The Dozen, and Love Actually.  Love Actually rocks and I will be buying it for my personal collection!  Paycheck actually wasn't too bad.    I haven't done any stitching yet.  Worked on jigsaw puzzles.  Gonna get the stitching out tomorrow though.  I've got all week.  Have a great Monday tomorrow!  Hugs -  Mel

      Hello all.  I have been a bit lax in my posting updates lately.  Lots going on.  So let's see....where to begin.....  Wednesday was a good day.  I got told I looked nice before leaving the house, there were retirement celebrations at work (i.e. free cake), and I found out that I would get to move into a new cubicle.  This is a wonderful thing since the cubicle I was in, sat right in front of the door of the room we are in.  Traffic grand central.  Very distracting.   The evening was basically uneventful.  I've been doing the online personals thing this week, so I had a few e-mails to swap.  That takes so much work and energy.  It's not really worth it, it's just something I do when I'm feeling really lonely.  Thursday was a most excellent day.  We got some project work done at work, and then the cubicle moves began!   I spent the afternoon helping others move, and then moving into my new space.  I had gone to Walmart on Wednesday night, and bought some cheap fabric to put on the walls.  I got some red, purple, and yellow.  I love it!!  It just brightens my cube up.  I want to get a cool picture to hang on the wall over the cube.  I'm definitely in a happy cozy place.  Here's a look......  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Oh yeah.....funny quote of the day......"don't you mean bald-moment instead of blonde-moment!?!"  :o)  So that's what you get when a bald guy does a funny.  It works for me.  The best part of Thursday was the evening.  It's official, I have a big crush on my roommate.  He's just too cute!  We hung around the house and drank again.  Of course this time I was introducing my roomie to the fine art of online dating.  We set him up with an ID and posted an ad.  Took a few pictures.  Look out babes of Nashville!  It was a very entertaining evening.  And I was pretty jealous of him when I had to get up this morning and get ready for work.  I'll get even next week when I'm on vacation.  :o)  We did see the coolest thing on the way to the liquor store though.  Check this out.....    It was gorgeous.  This bright, beautiful, perfect rainbow.  I haven't seen one in years.  It felt like a really good sign of things to come.    I'm looking forward to my holiday weekend and vacation.  There's just no telling what will happen and what fun will be had.

      How come, the moment I have plans is the same moment every person on the planet who knows me calls to go do something????  The reverse of that is, the moment I have some free time and would like to go out and do something, I cannot find any living person in the universe who doesn't already have plans!!!  ;o)  So this surprise evening of getting out of work before 8pm finds me eating popcorn for dinner and sitting in front of the computer.  I'm contemplating trying my hand at Texas Hold'em Poker.  Scary thought I admit.

      ...from J. Evidently he got hounded with phone calls tonight too. Story is she's an ex, was at the house last night to pick up some stuff, got the wallet and phone without his knowledge, and is wrecking havoc.  We'll see what happens. I told him I would give him the benefit of the doubt at this point and that I am definitely on guard.   He says he'll call me tomorrow to talk about his making me dinner this week.  Important note for the fellas:  THERE IS NO 2/3 DAY CALL RULE!!  If you go out with a woman you like, call her the next day and tell her that.  If you sleep with a woman, call her the next day.  Even if it's to say never mind, at least let her know.   Oh, and most importantly.....DON'T DATE WOMEN MORE THAN 10 YEARS YOUNGER THAN YOU!!!  You'll only regret it, and the worthwhile women won't want to deal with you and the drama of the little girls that won't let go.

      So for a Monday this wasn't a bad day at all.  I finally broke down and made the cell phone decision.  I ws tossing around the idea of completely getting rid of my home phone now that I have Comcast.   I'm bailed on that idea....I'm piggy backing the home and cell phones for a bit.  After a phone call I got tonight, I might decide to ditch the home phone soon though.  More on that later.  The best news of the day?????   My new palm pilot finally got here!  So did the case for it!!  It's charging as I type and I am so ready to be synced up again.  Boy did I miss it.  Remember the recent post where I expressed disappointment in J for not calling me on Saturday?   Well, I had a voice mail message from him when I got home for lunch today.  Called him back.  He said he tried to call me a couple times and didn't leave a message.  He thought I had caller ID and would see that he called.  He asked when he would get to see me again.  With this weeks work schedule I told him it was very unsure.  He said he would call me in a couple days.  See...had it not been for the phone call I got this evening, I would actually be pleased about this.  Alas, I'm wondering what kind of person J really is.  The phone call was from a woman claiming to be J's current girlfriend of 3 years.  Nope, you never really do want to get a call like that.  UGH!!!!!  :o)   She wanted to know if I would stop calling J, where he and I met, etc.  And I really wouldn't have doubts about him except for one thing - I've only ever called him on his cell phone.  You pretty much have to be around that phone to get my home number.   Which tells me he's either lied to me or is being horribly stalked.   Whichever, I'm pretty sure we can write Mr. J off very soon.  Since I've deleted my online personals profile and account, I'm left with one potentially promising man.  Mr. B.   We traded some IM's today.  He asked me to e-mail him one of the pictures that was posted on my profile.  Still seems like a basically sane person.   We'll see how that goes!

      Blog is having posting issues today.  Did I tell you that I got home from the lake on Sunday and the roomie had left the stove on!?!??!?!   Yet not real thrilled with that blonde moment.  Glad the house didn't burn down.

      Cats are wonderful cuddle buddies.  They are soft and sweet.  And the most EVIL of alarm clocks on the weekend!!!!!   Can you say 7AM!?!?!?   Yep - the little rascals, started the call for food.  Ugh.   Roomie and I both ended up waking up - he went for coffee and I started some breakfast.  Roomie being hung over like he was (is it any wonder with all those pina coladas) ended up crashing on the couch.  I curled up in my room for a bit.   My plan was to get to the boat dock for the day at the lake outing with the work gang by 10:30.  I got up at 10:30.  :D   Still made it there by 11:30 with a stop at Walmart for chips on the way.  Boy is hanging out at the lake a life I could stand.   It was an absolutely perfect day.  Weather more like September than the middle of August.   It was fantastic.  Top it off with a hamburger cooked on the grill, and there really isn't anything better.  I didn't leave until about 4:30.  Of course I could have taken a nap starting around 2:30.  Didn't though.   Got home to get ready for my date to meet Mr. S.  He was cool and let me push the time back 30 minutes.  We met at Cinco de Mayo.  Surprisingly enough, I didn't fall asleep after my first margarita.  As tired as I was, that was surprising.  It helped that Mr. S was talkative.  Cute, entertaining guy.  It wasn't until about an hour in to the date that his conversation got a little bizarre for me.  He is obviously anti-government, which seems a tad strange for an ex-Marine (although that could be the reason).   He's got some pretty out-there philosophies on things.  I got a few good chuckles.  Didn't say much.  There are some people you can't argue or talk reason with.  I'm not sure we'll being seeing each other again.   All in all it was a good weekend.  I have to say I like a little bit more lazy in them though.  :D

      Oh how I could have used another lazy Saturday.  Alas it was not to be.   I came in to work for a few hours to try and get the requirements document done.  I've gotten about halfway through it.  The hardest part is barely dented though.  I got home around 5.  Surprisingly the roomie was there.  He went to Atlanta with the other docs for a conference/seminar thing.  Evidently they were bored so they came back home after about 1 hour.  Which meant the roomie was bored.  We hung out and chatted a bit.  When I went to get ready for my Saturday evening date, he went to the liquor store.  :D   Yep - pina coladas baby!!   His was a good attempt...they were nowhere near as good as mine.  So before I left, I made another pitcher to get him through the evening!  My date Saturday evening was with Mr. B.  He's the one I had coffee with last weekend.  We met at Opry Mills to catch dinner and a movie.  Planning didn't work out for a dinner at Macaroni Grill, and that turned out to be okay.  With the Titan's playing the first pre-season game, I suggested eating at Jillian's so we could chat and keep tabs on the game.  And of course with the pina coladas started before I left the house, I kept Mr. B well entertained.  We had some time to kill between dinner and the movie, so we did a little walking around.  He wanted to check out Tower records for something he's been looking for, and ended up buying me a CD.  It's by Jem - an artist you can hear on 100.1 Lightening 100.  It's awesome.  His reasoning was that since he didn't buy me flowers, the least he could do was buy me a CD.  It was very sweet actually.  And a smart move on his part - whenever I listen to I have a thought of him.  So here's the embarrassing part - two mature 30 somethings went to see the movie Harold & Kumar Go To Whitecastle!!  :o)   It was completely stupid hillarious!!   Guys will love it.  Not mentally challenging by any means.  I did love Neal Patrick Harris in it though - boy has Doogie Howser grown up!!  After the movie B walked me to my car, and I drove him to his.   We talked a bit and I got a very nice couple of kisses.    It's a bit disarming to spend time with a real man that is a real gentleman.  B is definitely someone I want to spend more time with.   I got back home about 11:30 - the house was lit up like a Christmas Tree!!  The roomie had gone to Krogers and was cooking up some shrimp and basically turning my kitchen into a disaster area!!   That's the last time I leave him unattended with a pitcher of pina coladas!!  It's fun to hang out with a cool friend after a cool date....except for the part where he kept asking me about the movie....like 10 times!!!!  :D  Rumor has it he has tickets to the Titan's game next weekend and is going to take me.  We'll see if he remembers that part.

      ...The great date never called.  Which wouldn't have been so bad if J had not specifically said he would.   Yes it's disappointing.   I didn't dwell on it over the weekend...and I won't dwell on it now.  I've got too much going on and life is too short to try and ponder what's going on in someone else's brain.   I can barely keep up with my own.  :D

      Anticipation can be a tricky thing.  If it goes on too long, sometimes it can build things up to more than they could ever be.  A lot like dread, which can make a harmless thing seem like a miserably insermountable obstacle.  I definitely had some anticipation building up to my date with J.   The whole circumstance of how we met and started talking.  I never got nervous about it.  I definitely had high hopes for our evening.  And let me tell you...the evening did not disappoint!  First let me describe J.  He's 35, about 5'8", very short dark hair, deep brown eyes, and a flat out incredible physique.  It's obvious he pumps iron.  He's got a chest, shoulders, and arms that are just yummy!  :o)  And yes ladies, I did take the opportunity to check out his tush.....well yummy just seems to be the right word....and maybe the phrase "squeezably soft" cause it definitely looked it!  Oh, and don't let me forget to mention he's got the cutest dimples - when he smiles they are just adorable!  J arrived promptly at 6 in his burgundy colored Toyota Tundra king cab.  He came in for a minute to meet the cats, then walked me to the truck, opened the door for me, and made sure I was seated comfortably before shutting the door and walking around to get in the truck.  Fellas take note - it's very cool to open the door for a lady.  The chatting started instantly.   And took us all the way to the restaurant.   Here's another note for the fellas - if you think she looks nice, tell her....it will result in an even bigger smile.  We went to Blackstones in downtown Nashville for dinner.  The food was fabulous.  The drinks were excellent - I definitely recommend the chocolate martini!!   The best part was the company.  J is a funny and intelligent conversationalist.  I definitely didn't have to entertain myself - he did that for me.  It was a lot of fun getting to know him.  We both expressed how much we were enjoying each others company.  And J thoroughly enjoyed the fact that I have a sense of humor and am not afraid to use it!  I actually got him a couple times and evidently he's not used to that.  The coolest thing was J holding my hand.  I don't know what it is about hands with me.  I can still think back to the first time I noticed how moving, intimate, erotic, and loving hand holding could be.  When we were done eating dinner and still sitting and talking, J took my hand in his and it was just so comfortable.  We also had our fist kiss sitting there at the table.  :)   It was very sweet.  I know that word seems trite...it's just the only thing I can think of at the moment.  Needless to say J and I were very comfortable with each other.  Me being me I asked a bunch of nosey questions trying to find out his psycho factor.  He didn't mind a bit and I haven't yet found a psycho indicator.  So it's all good.  We ended up going back to my house to watch a movie (I had borrowed a few from the library and evidently The Score with Robert DeNiro is a manly kind of movie).   We did stop by the liquor store to pick up a bottle of vodka - J was willing to try a martini and I was willing to try the new French vodka.   That may have been a mistake, because my head still hurts this morning.  :)  I can tell you I don't remember any of the movie.  Turns out that not only does J like holding hands and cuddling, he's an excellent kisser!  So pretty much all  I remember from the rest of the evening is the kissing and the cuddling.  We fell asleep that way (fell asleep, passed out, whichever).  It was very cozy.  My apologies to J's dogs - they were probably not very happy this morning when he got home to let them out!!   Poor puppies.  I hope they don't hold it against me.  :o)  I am glad that J didn't drive after the vodka though.  Granted Mt. Juliet isn't far....just not worth the risk though.  Oh, as for when I will see J again?  Well, he wanted to come by this afternoon before this evenings date - yes he wants to mess with my mind and get an advantage over the next guy!  And there is potential for dinner at his house one night next week.

      It's really funny how the laws of the universe work.  The more you want something or someone, the more it or they seem to move away.  It's called the universal message of "wanting."  By sending out that vibe, that's what comes back, the vibe of wanting.  I know, deep thoughts explained in a shallow way.  Whatever.  So I've been giving this online dating thing a try.  I've met a few people.  Nothing major.  I have met a "special" friend that has come in handy on a couple of occassions.  Nothing serious, just the right kind of fun.  Many women may experience this, I however can only speak for me.  When "that time of the month" is done, I'm out of my mind with a craving for something that isn't chocolate!   It's what I would imagine it's like for a werewolf during a full moon.  As it turns out, timing really is everything.  My one and only special friend was out of town.  And still is.        Enter Melanie's frustration at the cruelness of life!!  :o))   That friend is suppose to be back in town Sunday night.  Hopefully Monday evening will take care of my craving issues.  And the wait is for Monday, because I have gone from a time when nobody was around or even had my number, to a weekend of dates.  Three nights - three different guys.   Who gets how this happens!?!?!?!?  :)   Hopefully one of these bloks will turn out to be a wonderful presence to add to my life.....maybe even with some benefits.  They've all got potential.  I really like the idea of not having to introduce myself to anyone else ever again!!!!   Boy does that take a lot of energy.   As for this weekend....well I'll be happy to get a regular date out of one of these meetings.   Of course I have a preference, however after the disaster date a few weeks ago, I know nothing is a sure bet!

      Like how a dead mouse gets in your house!  It's really beside the point that I have 3 adorable cats.  I expect them to make mice dead.  And this one looked like it had been well played with.   The thing I'm wondering is, if the cat door was open and they could only get to the patio....was the mouse really dumb enough to run onto a patio with three cats on it!?!?!?   Or, did the mouse somehow make it's way into the house and then died of fright when it saw the 3 cats????  We may never know what really happened....the dead mouse has been disposed of and all seems well.  Of course the cats are eating a WHOLE bunch more food all of a sudden.  I'm thinking of putting them back on the cheap stuff!!  :o)

      I took the films home to the roomie Tuesday morning.  He checked them over and said they looked fine.  Doc and the radiologist would need to check them out too.  Got a call in the afternoon - the radiologist report was in.  Hip was fine.  No problems found.  This is good AND bad.  It's good because there isn't anything seriously wrong.   It's bad because I am still in constant pain!!!   It's not AS bad as it was.  I still limp with every step.  Stretching doesn't relieve it.  And I feel broken down.   Sigh.  So now I've got to figure out what to do next.  I'm thinking about scheduling an appointment at the Franklin Bone & Joint clinic.   There's got to be something I can do to get this pain gone and get back to feeling good again.  I'm not getting any answers or suggestions from the chiropractors, so it's time to try another field of medicine.

      The women will probably appreciate this more than any man could.  My week started off a lot yucky.  We're talking the heart of "that time of the month" and the cramps to go with it.  If a man, or a woman who has never experienced cramps, wants to know what it feels like, I can sum it up - cramps feel like abdominal surgery pain right after you've been wheeled out of the operating room!  And they don't go away.  They are all day constant - on average for 2 whole days.  So that was a bummer start to my week.  Let me tell you....it didn't take long to get a lot better.  You may have read a previous post...or two or three...where I mentioned the hip pain I've been having.  Well last week I worked with the roomie and Doc to get an MRI scheduled so we can see what's going on.  The MRI got scheduled for Tuesday morning at 7:15.  Keep in mind that I am NOT a morning person, so the fact that I volunteered to get up early and do this was a major step.  Tuesday arrived and I got ready.  I did my basic getting ready routine with the exception of make-up and clothing with metal objects.  I wore my cotton work out shorts with my a blue shirt and wore a camisole instead of a bra.  Perfect for a metal free zone like an MRI.  So off I went.  Ever notice how there isn't a lot of traffic on the road at 6:50 in the morning?  Me neither cause I'm usually in the bed or the shower!!  :0)  I walked into the imaging center, and of course was the only person there.  As it turns out the tech was solo as well.  When I got to the window he said "you must be here for an MRI?" and I told him he was psychic.  We got off to a good chuckle for so early in the morning, which was cool cause he was kinda cute too.  So I checked in, hit the potty, did the copy of the insurance card, reviewed some questions (I was concerned about there potentially being some internal metal with the tubal clips), and was all ready to go.     As we headed back to the MRI room, being the girly new home owner that I am, I of course had to comment on some furniture pieces.  Cute techie dude said all the women do.  We got back to the little changing room and I let the techie dude that I was wearing metal free clothing so I didn't have to put on the gown.  Thankfully the MRI machine was one of the new "open" ones so it wasn't too bad.  The only bad part about the MRI was the pain in my lower back (we didn't get enough pillows under my knees) and my arms falling asleep.  Note of advice - if you ever go for an MRI, just leave your arms down by your sides.  It took about 30 minutes.  I was uncomfortable because the back arm stuff.  Overall the process wasn't bad.  The techie dude checked in between MRI rounds and it all went smoothly.  So when the MRI was done, the techie dude came in to lower the table and send me on my way.  We were chatting about jobs and roommates and generic kind of stuff.   As I stood up to get ready to walk out, the techie dude told me that he would have the films ready for me to take with me.  Then he asked if I was married?   I of course said no.  He said he wanted to tell me how attractive he thought I was!   I said thanks and joked with him about how he could have told me that even if I was married.   Here's the part where he really made my day - he asked me if he could call me sometime!!!  I'VE NEVER HAD THAT HAPPEN.  I was so surprised that this cute guy would want to ask me out at just having met me.  He thought my surprised hesitation was going to be a no.  I told him absolutely not that it he was more than welcome to give me a call.  I asked his name, we'll call him Mr. J, and shook his hand.   J walked me back out to the lobby so I could wait for my MRI films.   Fellas, if you even think it, tell her!!!   And if you want to call her, ask her for her number!!!  You might be surprised and so might she!!  So I waited for a few minutes in the lobby (must have been the work out shorts cause I got checked out by a guy coming in for his own MRI).  J came out with MRI films in hand and walked me out of the office.  He again asked if it was okay for him to call.  I told him absolutely and that I didn't have plans on Friday.  :)  Gang I was walking on air for the rest of the day.  It couldn't have gone bad.  And J did call.   That night.  And the next night.  And the next night.   Welcome to Friday.  He's picking me up at 6.  I can't wait!!  Oh, and did I tell you he thinks I'm a hot babe!?!?!?

      Okay, so last Sunday I met Mr. B for coffee.  As it turns out he had no problem finding the Starbucks counter in my local Barnes & Noble.  :o)    Actually we both arrived before the store opened, so we walked in together.  He did buy me my mocha so that was sweet.  B and I had a nice little chat.  He's got a Masters in Chemistry and another one in Organizational Management.  Basically he's a very smart dude.  Doesn't talk in another hemisphere either, which I thought was good.   He's a nice looking man.  The big thing for me was the fact that he looked like, and sounded like, a man and not a little boy.  And I didn't feel more intelligent or more worldly.   I enjoyed our coffee chat time and I think there is potential here.  We'll find out on Saturday evening's outing.

      It's in Nashville.  Actually it's at the Post Office as of noon today.  So I might have it tomorrow.  Could be Monday.   Of course the status on the case is well, who the heck knows.  It may not have left Utah yet!!  :)

      Growing up I was never much of an athlete.  I tended to prefer indoor activities like reading and watching the TV, to sweaty outdoor activities during the summer.  Evidently I was not all that observant to my surroundings either, because the word "lazy" was thrown at me quite often as a kid.  I heard it in my head last Saturday.  I heard it when I didn't get up before 8 a.m.  I heard it when the cats woke me up and I stayed in bed.  I heard it when I finally got out of bed at noon.  I heard it when I sat on the couch and ate "brunch."  I heard it when I laid on the couch and flipped channels.  I heard it when I didn't take a shower until 6 p.m. that night.  I stomped it out every time I heard it too!!  I am not a lazy person.  I work hard.  I keep my home mostly clean.  I do the dishes, wash the clothes, pay my bills.  I am a very responsible adult.   Who would have imagined that it would take 20 years for me to let myself relax without guilt.    My life is my own and I have every right to be as busy, or as not busy, as I want to be.  It's okay for me to lounge around in my pajamas if I want to.  Yes, I'm working on convincing myself as much as I am just telling you about it.  Turns out I'm pretty good at being lazy when I apply myself!!

      It died before.  Scary moments.  Not knowing how I would make it without it.  It came back to life.  Dented cover scotched taped on and it still had life in it.  Phone numbers and my schedule were accessible and the little press of a button.  However the recovery was short lived.  It bleeped it's last ounce of life last week.  Stupid thing wouldn't charge anymore!!  :o)  So I bit the bullet and ordered a replacement.  Not the sleek, high speed, high memory, multi-function one I really really would like to have.  Just a good sturdy, gray-scale, enough memory to do what I need it to do.  Ordered a case for it too so jostling, dropping, and purse traveling will be less harmful.  Waiting is the hardest part......Overstock didn't even ship it until the 12th!!  Sigh.....so here I am....no palm pilot....hoping I don't lose all the schedule and phone number notes I'm carrying around with me......

      I want to send a very belated thank you. To whom I honestly can't say. I received the following message in reply to one of my blog posts last week:    "Keep your faith in yourself and in humanity. It's not as bad as you think it is. You are the eternal optimist and others reflect and look up to you for this wonderful attribute. Expect big things from yourself and keep on blogging! "    I have called myself a "Pollyanna" for several years now.   With some of the life experiences I have been through, I cannot help appreciating life and all it's wonderful possibilities.  No matter what my situation, there is always something worse.  I have so much to be grateful about.     Reading this message was like getting a great big hug just for being myself!  I couldn't ask for anything better.  So thank you to my anonymous comment poster.  You were my angel last week!

      My name is Melanie and this is my blog.  :o)  I have been horribly remiss in my blog posting duties as of late.  I apologize.  My only excuse is a bunch of excuses!!  So, I will work today and tomorrow to rectify the situation.  I've got several little updates for you.  Some ho hum....some potentially entertaining.  Until then....Happy Friday The 13th!!

      Not a shred of evidence exisits in favor of the idea that life is serious. (Brendan Gill)   It's Wednesday.  That's the only thing of significance to note about today.  It's another hot summer day in Nashville.   Last night was very low key.  My only blonde moment was getting distracted by the Rob Schneider movie "The Animal."   :o)   I am proud to report that I made the last payment on a credit card account yesterday.  Glad to have that gone.  Anxious to get the others done away with.  I did a free credit check last night.  The score has  come up a bit since the debacle surrounding the house purchase.  There were a few things that needed to be disputed.  All in all it wasn't too bad.  I'm borrowing the movie Mystic River from my friend Marsha.  Will probably watch it tonight.   My hip is sore today.  It doesn't feel any worse - it just doesn't feel any better.  I did a lot of stretching last night, and wore my shoes with heel lift all night around the house.  Think I'm going to have to break down and go see another doc about it.  I was hoping to be back in exercise action this weekend, so looks like I'll continue to take it easy there.  Other than that, not much to report.  I still haven't gotten past the first chapter of Messenger by Lois Lowry.   And I still haven't picked up the Asimov BOT that's waiting for me at the library.   I'll definitely have entertainment options for the weekend.

      I think I'll be able to start exercising again.  My heel lifts came in the mail yesterday.  So what that they went to neighbor Chuck's house - he was kind enough to call me and let me know they were there!   I put one in my walking shoes last night - no hip pain while walking around the house.  I'm wearing one today.  Hip is still a little sore.  I think it's because these shoes have a bit of a heel to them.   So I'm relieved about that.  I did finally get a call about the ice cream cake last night.  I didn't answer the phone, the roomie did.  So of course I blew it off this morning in IM's - it is after all, all good and there is nothing to worry about.  I've had some cake, and learned my lesson too!  ;)  Having a really good hair day today.  Doesn't make up for the yucky meeting this morning.  Something about this time around makes the application process review with developers seem like it's not going so well at all.  I'm bringing the project manager back in on it for assistance.  Other than that, I'm looking forward to walking the greenway this evening - I'll take it easy a bit just to make sure all is well.  It's just going to be so good to move again.

      So it was Mr. D's birthday yesterday.  Known it was coming.  Even chatted about it a couple weeks ago.  Ordered an ice cream cake.  Was just trying to be thoughtful.  Everyone should have a big deal made about them on their birthday.  Everybody should have a cake too!  There were some challenging times over the past couple of weeks.  Bad days, busy weekends.  Still, life is good.  In IMing Mr. D on Friday, he revealed that between work and play his weekend was absolute chaos.  Okay.  No big.  When would you like your cake?  Monday.  Monday would be good - I've got the day off.  Welcome to Monday.  I heard nothing from him all day.  I finally IM'd a message to his phone this afternoon asking about the cake.  Got no message.  Fast forward to a few hours later.  Hey D, how's your day going?  No big deal, day off, almost to my dad's for my birthday dinner.  Wha???????????  Okay, so when do you want your cake!?!?!?  WHY DO I BOTHER!!!!!!!!   I feel like a pathetic, naive, idiot.  I really thought I was doing something nice for someone.  And it doesn't even register.  Guys, if you ever wonder why women treat you so bad, this is an example of why.  Because on occassions when we've done something nice for a man, we were dissed.  I actually invited a friend over to help me eat the ice cream cake.  She's doing really well on her diet and declined.  Yes, I've sliced into.  It tastes terrible.  It's freezer-burnt.   FYI - when you order an ice cream cake, make sure it's going to be eaten the day you pick it up.  Between this incident, and constant reminders from my roomie that men are shallow creatures only interested in the few, the gorgeous, the skinny big boobed babes, it's a wonder any man gets the time of day from any woman.  Times of loneliness are preferred to being this disrespected and appreciated.   I just don't get it.  Why do we treat badly those who treat us kindest?????????    What human mechanism started that bull!?!?!?!?  If you sensed anger, you're right.  If you sensed disappointment, you're right.  If you sensed broken hearted hurt feelings, bingo.  All of the above.  Sigh....

      My weekend definitely had it's ups and downs. It was just slightly more laid back than last weekend.  Friday after work, Marsha came over and we drank pina coladas. Then Casandra came and picked us, and the 3 of us went to play pool. Boy was my game NOT on!! Roomie would have been embarrassed. I need a lot more practice. And then somehow, I got conned into going bowling. I haven't bowled in like 16 years. It only took one time of being told I bowl like Herman Munster to end my bowling career! :o) Yet another activity that will take a lot of practice on my part. I didn't break the 70s!  It was a fun night. I like going out with the girls. Marsha had her mom/wife night out for the month. She had more than her fair share of adult beverages, so I drove her home. And I woke up the roomie to follow me in my car - yep, I owe him for that one.  Saturday started a little later in the day....well I mean we didn't get home until almost 2. I don't know what pushed me over the edge to do it, must have woken up in a strange mood, because I called Comcast and set up high speed internet. I ate breakfast, okay brunch, then showered, dressed, and headed to Metro Center. Luckily the line wasn't too bad, and the rain shower didn't last long, so I was home by 12:30 and get started with my installation. (At this point I've decided to not talk about the Honda Accord's I saw as I drove by the Honda dealership...whimper...whimper...whine..lust...lust...crave....darn budget).  I took my time installing the NIC card and setting up the modem. Everything was going fine, or so it seemed. When it came time to install the service software, it could not recognize the NIC card. I kept working on it, and in the meantime called Net Zero to cancel my dial-up service. OHMIGOD was that not the most horrendous experience I have had in years!!! First off, my call got disconnect 3 times, each after I had been holding for about 5 minutes. I finally got a human being. Actually, I think he was either a demon, or a robot. His name was Ray. If I had any kind of psychic ability, Ray would have spontaniously combusted about 2 minutes into the phone call. All I wanted was to cancel my service. I don't care that they hate to hear that. I don't want anything else. Just cancel my service. I was so angry during this phone call! Ray kept talking around me in circles. He would not listen to me! Word of warning to all: AVOID NET ZERO OR JUNO INTERNET SERVICE. Cheap service is not worth the experience I went through.  I finally got the cancellation code. Hung up and layed my head down on the desk and cried. That Net Zero phone call was a miserable experience and I hated how I had to act just to get a stupid cancellation done. So after I regained my composure (thanks to the roomie for the pat on the back and the chicken wings), I got back to the cable modem set up. I called Melissa and she didn't have any issues with her installation (here's me experiencing XP envy), so I broke down and called Comcast. Jason was a dude! It was really cool. Laughed at my reference to my blonde moment and worked patiently with me to work out my issues.  Unfortunately, there wasn't anything Jason could do. As it turns out, my computer had Windows 98 version 1. I would have to upgrade to even get the USB modem hook-up to work. Sigh.......... At this point it's after 4pm. I went to pick up Mr. D's birthday cake (ice cream cake from Baskin Robbins) and stopped by Radio Shack to pick up one of those instant access cd's so I could have internet access to get the windows upgrade and stuff that I needed.  I ended up going back to Marsha's house to get help installing an upgrade to Windows 98SE and checking my NIC card. Thank goodness for friends with skills!! :D I got back home, hooked everything up, and the thing worked like a charm! Cable internet rocks!!! And Marsha's mother-in-law thinks I'm completely insane (Well, it sounded like Marsha who answered the phone when I started chanting "i love you"). Oh, and that internet access CD I picked....well it was for Earthlink. And Courtney was an absolute angel when I called to cancel that service. So there is always a balance.  So around 8:00 Saturday night I finally finished the internet set up....took so long I missed out on a free movie outting to see Bourne Supremacy with the roomie. I ended up spending a quiet rest of the evening at home. Loving high speed though.  Sunday (happy birthday to Mr. D) started late in the day too. Abbie started meowing around 7 - opened up the cat door and crawled myself back up to bed. Roomie went to the store for coffee, I added an order for breakfast fixins, and then I cooked breakfast - scrambled eggs with ham and cheese, and some sausage. Ate breakfast, lounged around a little, got online and played black jack and euchre with Casandra. I actually played so blonde that it reduced her euchre rating. That's bad!! :o) I then went back downstairs to watch Starsky and Hutch. I actually got some stitches in on Celestial Dragon.  That's about it. I painted my toenails and fingernails, did some laundry, watched Bravo Celebrity Poker, and went to bed. Had troubles sleeping. Think it was from having caffine late in the day. Caused a headache and insomnia. Luckily I slept well and am pretty awake today.
