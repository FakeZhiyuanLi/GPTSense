      Ola. As usual, I'm at the office. It is close to 2 PM right now and I just had lunch. I had one of those healthy tv dinner crap and then I went out to get icea cream. I got hersey's vannila ice cream, double stacked on the cone and with rainbow sprinkles. Yumm. So anyways work's fine so far. We had a meeting earlier and we found that that our deal with Barnes and Noble went through! So between May 31st and June 4th there will be a men's interest magazine promotion thingy and our mag is going to be a part of it. And it will be on the newsstands as well. And this is a nationwide thing, it'll be in over 600 B&N stores around the country. So all you people out there, go get the magazine! It's called The Green. It's a golf and travel mag, it's interesting, it has good content, and better yet it's my baby! So all of you better go run out and buy them soon so I can keep my job. Hehe. Okay so yesterday after work I went to a shitload of places, the plan was to go shopping with what little money I have. I went to Soho. I went to H&M, American Eagle, Urban Outfitters, a bunch of shoe places (although I wasn't looking for shoes), and those trendy Soho boutiques. Of course I didn't find anything because either they're way overpriced or because they made me look fat. It's weird, sometimes I go shopping and feel fabulous and everything looks great. And then some other times I feel like crap and everything I put on looks like a shit and I look like a potato sack. It was just one of those days. But anyways I did ended up getting a green knee-length skirt and this cute white canvas bag from H&M. Total damage done: $24.50. Not bad at all.  I went home, Loren was napping. She got up, we watched the Sixth Sense, it was on tv. I've never seen it before and it would've been great if not for the fact that I already knew that Bruce Willis' character is actually dead. So that kinda ruined it. But other than that it was good. Haley Joel Osment is one creepy kid. Jeez. He freaks the shit out of me. Anyways then Chris came home and we played scrabble. I won yeah. We decided to make the game into a tournament where at the end of the week who has the most points wins a prize. Prizes can be like a dinner, a get-out-of-cleaning-day card, a dime of goodness, etc etc. Anyways we smoked and chilled and then I went to sleep ata round 3.30. Today I'm going to meet with Elliot and then we're going to Pratt to check out Anna's paintings. I'm going right after work. i am so excited! I have never seen Anna's stuff before and I head she's pretty fucking good. She paints abstract on this huge canvases, at least 6 foot by 8 foot, some even bigger, and she only uses pallete knife when she paints. No brushes. Sounds pretty cool huh? She's a juniot at pratt. Anyways I'm v. excited. Sometimes I am so jealous at artists, esp. painters because they have this beautiful concrete results out of their creativity. It's visual and I think very interesting. I mean I love writing and I can't for the life of me imagine doing anything else but that with my life but words have a different effect compared to paintings you know. Not necessarily worse/better just different. We'll see, one day I shall have a book out and that would be so cool. Ah whatever. We'll see.  Anyways I better go. I feel so unproductive. Peace!

      Aaah, what a gloomy day. It's raining, misting, humid, and of course, mad cloudy. I actually kinda like it. It gives Monday a mellow feeling, and I feel somewhat melancholy. Anyways it is around 10 Am right now and I am sitting at my desk in the office. Our email server is down and I don't really have shit to do. So what it looks like is that I might just slack around and do some light research/ reading for the articles I have to do for our next issue. I'm writing one on minority golf rookies and one on the hottest/best vodka around. Guess which one will I do more hands-on research? Hmm. So this weekend went by pretty fast. On Friday after work I went and buy two pairs of shoes, they were buy one get one half off. I almost felt guilty handing my money to the register because I haven't bought anything (aside from food, metro-cards, and stogs) in about three months. But of course once I got home and tried on my killer black pumps and my pale pink flats, the ol feelings come running back. Shoes, how I miss thou.  Anyways then I got home, chilled, Loren came home and then Elliot came over, we chilled, did some lines, played Uno, etc etc. Then Alex, Chris, Alan, came and we all just chilled. Anna came later, John dropped her off and I said hi. Haven't seen him in a while. So anyways basically the whole night was just coke-filled awesomeness for me. Some of us were doing lines all night and some were just smoking themselves retarded. At the end of the night though, we all chilled in our livingroom, talking, playing Uno, and smoking a huge blunt together. Everyone broke out around 5 AM. Anna crashed and she slept on my bed. Also, to top the night off, he called me. Which was weird because we never usually talk during the weekends, so that was kinda sweet. Would've been better if my head wasn't spinning while I was talking to him but whatever. On Saturday I didn't do SHIT. I slept all day, ordered fried calamari and rice balls from Casa Calamari, hung out watch TV, chilled with Chris and Loren, and that's pretty much all. Sunday was a great day though. Me and Alan woke up around 2.30 and then we went to eat breakfast food for lunner at Pegasus. I had this awesome french toast, with eggs and ham. Holy shit it was one of the best breakfast I've had in years. Or maybe it was because I didn't eat anything the whole weekend. After that me and Al went to KB Toys. I was gonna get Twister but Alan convinced me to get Scrabble instead. We were at the toy store for about 2 hours just playing with stuff. So much fun. I wish I was a kid again, so I have an excuse to spend all my money on toys. There was this awesome board game called Gooey Looey. Basically it's just a big plastic head and what you do is you take turns putting your fingers in Looey's nose and pulled out boogers. And every now and then when someone pulled out this "wrong" booger, Looey's head would open and his brains pop out. It's pretty awesome. We didn't get it though because we'd prob. get sick of it pretty fast. Anyways, after KB toys we went to Century. I tried on a shitload of stuff but of course didn't get shit. When I was in the fitting rooms, this girl right across from me was basically naked. (The fitting rooms at Century is just this one huge room with stalls and no doors). Not that I was checking her out or anything but I can totally see her from my mirror. It was really distracting. She had on this black g-string thingy that even looks painful. And she wasn't wearing a bra. She had a pretty nice body, I mean her ass is alright but she got a huge rack. Man I sound like a guy. Anyways she wasn't wearing a bra and was trying on all this tops and dresses. Ewww. I thought that was pretty repulsive. But whatever. Alan got this nice cargo shorts thing and I got a watch. yeah. I haven't worn a watch in about 2 years and now I finally have one. It's a black band looking thing and cookie monster on the face. It was ten bucks, a Sesame Street product, and proceeds go to educational projects for children round the world. Can't get any better. anyways after that we were walking home and the ice cream truck was there and I got vanilla cone with rainbow sprinkles. yumm. then we chilled at home, played some intense games of scrabble with chris, and then alex, anna came over and all of us watched Kill Bill Vol.1.  I don't know what the fuck is wrong with some people but that film fucking rocks! Holy shit, everything about it was over-the-top, cartoonish, sometimes cheesy, but in a totally good way. It's a big extravagant shebang, but it works. Typical Tarantino movie. The story's great, the cinematography is sick, and the soundtrack is awesome. I have to get it. Anyways yeah so all of us are going to go see the second one on Wednesday. i can't wait. Anyways I had a little interruption just now. Had a talk with the big boss and basically he's wondering why i'm sending all these writers to go on the press trips instead of myself. he said it's a perk and I should go for it. So anyways he's going to try to get a europe trip soon and if we get one, I'll be packing my bags. Yeah! Alright, I'm gonna go. Time to actually work. Peace!

      Ah..it's almost four. This day has gone by sooooooooooooooooooooooooo fucking long. I want to tear out my hair. It's so weird I got to work today all happy and chipper and shit, and now I'm so fucking dead. I just want to get the fuck home, can't be here anymore. I want to go home and have a long fucking weekend. Anyways, nothing interesting happened so far. last night instead of going to sleep after I wrote in my blog, I ended up playing Uno again with Loren, only this time Alan was studying and in his place we had Chris. It was pretty intense, we kept screwing each other in the ass. Hmm that didn't come out right. Whatever. Anyways Chris won, and Loren was the loser in the end. Buahahaha.   Anyways, I was watching Friends last night. Man that show has gone downhill it's so sad. They should just fucking end it right now already. The whole episode last night didn't really have shit. The only funny thing was the Phoebe can actually do an Estelle really good. And what the fuck was the whole bit with the paper eating guy in th end? Ridiculous. I miss the old Friends episodes. They were so much better. Now I have to resort to stupid reality shows that eventhough I know they're just horrible, I can't have enough of them. I'm such a reality tv whore. Man. And that show The Swan, god. It's just pathetic. I mean all those people supposedly found true "happiness" after being tucked, cut, sewn, pulled, whatever with shit. It's so weird. I would love to see The Swan 2, a sequel where they visit those women say twenty years from now where the perky boobs are now sagging to their waist, they lipo-ed stomachs and thighs all lumpy and uneven. See that would be somewhat fun to watch. Man am I being mean? Nah. What's even worse is that at the end of each shows when they "reveal" the contestants (losers) they all started crying and laughing hysterically, saying "I'm so beautiful," "I'm so beautiful." jeesh. Some of them are still ugly and most of them just look so plastic right now even my ass looks better than their faces. At least my ass is real. Argh, I have to find something to do at work.  Should go now. Well, have a splendid weekend, this is evilchinadoll signing out. Peace.

      So it's almost midnight. Believe it or not but I'm actually getting ready to go to bed. It's been a long ass day. I didn't do anything much last night. I think. To be honest I don't really remember. I went to bed around 3.30, and I woke up at 7. I was sitting on the couch having a stog and watching the news, waiting for the weathergirl to show up. Before I know it I was sleeping and then Loren woke me up. I look at her and thought.. no, no fucking way. Yes way, it was 9. I was supposed to be at work at 9. I was supposed to meet with the new editor-in-chief and get him up to speed on stuff before our editorial meeting at 10.30. It's his first day. And I got there at 10, great first impression huh? He was fine though, wasn't pissed or anything. After talking to him, we had the meeting and it lasted for about 3 hours. Not bad. I left work at 6 and then I stopped by at Victoria's Secret. I went to get perfume and I smelled all the different perfumes that they have. All with cheesy names like heaven, divine, angel mist, etc. What the fuck is angel mist anyway? They should have more like angel sweat, or angel dust. Whatever. Anyways after I numbed my already damaged nose with all the fucking smelling, the only one I like was called Very Sexy. How cliche. So I got it, I mean it's only twenty five bucks anyway. I wish I can get my regular perfume, but guccy envy or pleasures cost like sixty bucks. I can't afford to smell that good right now so I guess I settled for cheap knock-off Victoria's Secret good smell. Whatever. Anyways after that I went looking around the lingerie, at stuff I couldn't afford. It was absurd. They have this Roberto Cavalli for VS bra and panty sets that are like five hundred bucks a pop, no shit. Fucking 500 bucks. What the fuck, I better start crapping money first before I bought a fucking 200 buck thong. Seriously.  Anyways, I went home, got this awesome beef shish kebob thing from the greek place round the corner from my house and gorge myself like a fucking bear before hibernation. I chilled like a fattie for a bit, then Alan got home and we started playing an intense game of Uno. We were drinking a little bit too, I guess that's kinda why the game got intense. We decided to play whoever wins five games first will be crowned the bayridge uno champion. After some serious name calling and heavy cheating on both parts, Alan led three to one. Then some more serious name calling and heavy cheating, I started catching up. In the end, I totally won. HUAHahHAHAHA (evil laugh). Man I'm sad. At least I wasn't watching TV. Anyways then Loren got home, we played one more game of Uno, and then smoked stogs and talked and here I am.  So tomorrow's Friday, and I'm fucking stoked. This week has gone by so fast, I felt like I just got back from Purchase yesterday. So Paul and Al called me today and asked me if I want to hang with them at Fitz's tomorrow, and I just might. I haven't seen them in a while, since our V-Day shindig so it'd be nice. I don't thik Liz is going to be there though which sucks but whatever. I think tomorrow Anna and Elliot might come over and I don't know, I might just hang out with them here and then go to Smith's on Saturday. I haven't done some heavy drinking in a while.  Anyways, I'm gonna go. Ima have a couple of smokes and then go to bed. I can't fucking for the life of me be late tomorrow. Now that the EIC comes in at 9, I can't be late again. Fuck fuck. Whatever I figure it out. Good nite and peace out.

      He's different, my mother said to me when I was six, about my now twenty-five year old brother. But it doesn't matter, she said. It doesn't matter that my aunt Tina "I don't want another fucking baby" Tani dropped him on his head when he was a year and something months old, and that he didn't say a word for two years after that. It doesn't matter that for years of his teenage life he had to go to a special school and made special friends. It doesn't matter that he throws tantrums when he gets furstrated because we don't understand a word he said. It doesn't matter that my father never really sees him as someone he can trully love and be proud of. It doesn't matter that my little brother don't really get him and they have pity little fights for my mother's attention. It doesn't matter that almost every day I think about how I can never know if he really is happy with his life or is he miserable? He's special, my mother said. What matters to me is that when he smiles his dimples show and his whole face lights up. What matters is that when I cry alone in my room and he sees me he comes and sit with me, stroking my hair, looking at me with his naive eyes wondering if there's anything he can do to make me feel better. What matters is that when my mother gets upset over something and cries, he would cry with her. What matters is that when we take him on a road trip to see our cousins, he would sit quietly looking out the window, his eyes wide and his face bright, smiling at the people on the street. What matters is that when I talk to him on the phone thousands of miles away, he gets so excited that he trips his words and ends up laughing. What matters to me is that I know that when my brother loves, he trully and purely loves, not for any reason. I know that when he looks at me and hugs me, is because he loves me for being me.  He's not different, I told my four year old brother last year when he asks me why my twenty-five year old brother doesn't talk like normal people. He's not different, and it's not just that he's special, I told him.  He's extraordinary.

      So I woke up late yesterday and called out work. I don't really know what happened with my fucking alarm clock but I woke up at 10.30. I went back to sleep after that. I spent the whole day pretty much sleeping. Slept on my bed, slept on the loveseat, slept on the couch, etc. At around 6-ish I woke up for real and started cleaning the house a little because my friends were coming over to celebrate 4.20. Yeaah happy 4.20! So anyways, around 7 Alan came home, and at 8 Elliot came over. Me and Elliot did a couple lines and then we all hung out at the roof. Alan took his guitar and we were just there chillin, singing songs, being stupid and stuff.  At around ten, Val and Anna came over and then Chris, Loren, and Alex came. Me, Elliot, and Anna did more stuff (at this point I was so coked-up and I finished whataver's left from my weekend trip. Which is good cuz now I don't have anymore to do - ha.), and the rest of the guys just smoked a lot of pot. We chilled, listened to music, and talked. Anna was reading some Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer snipets to us, which was awesome. It's amazing how beautiful he writes. We talked a lot about life and stuff, as usual. Anna talked a lot about her parents and her being finally happy after years of, well not being happy. I'm so happy for her, she's been so fucking miserable lately and now she's finally happy and at peace with her own self.  She's finally comfortable in her own skin, which is great. So anyways after a while me, Anna, and Elliot smoked some pot. It was 4.20 afterall haha, even Loren smoked. Then Loren and Chris got into this lengthy, man, and kinda annoying debate about advertising in our society. We were all discussing it for a while, but then Lore and Chris just started debated hard core and kinda killed our buzz. I retreated to my room and wrote for a lil bit before Elliot and Anna found me and then we just sat for a bit listening to this song called Donor Organ by DJ Shadow. Anyways Anna and Val left, then we started watching The Big Lebowski hehe, of course, right? In the middle of the movie I got fucking hungry and me and Elliot had chocolate cake. Yumm. Anyways, I went to be around 3.30, got up this morning and here I am. Tired, hungry, and burnt out from a five-day coke binge. I probably lost about five or six pounds from that. But not to worry, the coke has run out, I am now broke, therefore no more coke. And of course, I'll gain my five/six pounds back hehe. Anyways, gotta go back to work. Peace.

      Monday sucks. So I am back at work, as usual. Today I got in late, but both my bosses weren't around. I hope none of my coworkers rat on me when I come in late. Anyways, after my boss came, she pulled me into her office and bitches about this thing I forgot to do. I forgot to call this woman that we were not going to cover her event (due to lack of fun and actual meaning/ purpose of the event itself -yuck). So anyways I apologized and called her. Fuck..drama too early in the fucking morning. So ANYWAYS, I had a fantastic fantastic weekend. Purchase was great. I saw the following bands:  the Juggaknots, Bouncing Souls, Mates of State, and Blonde Redhead.  I did not get to see:  Ted Leo/ Pharmacist, Thurston Moore  (I heard it was lame anyway), and  Ghostface Killah   (which was okay but supposedly fun cuz everyone got on stage). The Bouncing Souls, as expected, was fucking awesome. I also really really like Mates of State and Blonde Redhead. I think I'm gonna buy BR's cd. I should've bought it at the show, wa sonly 12 bucks. I'm a retard. But yeah the BR girl was Japanese and she sounds very Bjork-ish. Awesome. Aside from that the other bands were alright. There were a bunch of crappy no-name bands playing around noon to late afternoon but I was usually either too fucked-up or too hungover to go. So on Friday the trip there was alright. I catched the train and the bus rightaway. The thing was when I got the the campus I realzied I didn't have change and I had to walked around like a fucking idiot for almost an hour trying to find change/working payphone/vending machines that actually give your change back. Times like that I wish I still have my cellphone. Fuck you AT&T! Anyways, I finally called Elliot, and Alan went to meet me. At that point I was tired and pissed from walking around aimlessly and totally hating Purchase. My initial reaction of Purchase was that the campus, although big and air, kinda looks and feel like prison (not that I've been to prison. Hmm.). The buildings are boring and it was in the middle of nowhere. And the kids, they all look like either hippies or fake hipsters. Keep in mind I was in a hateful mood.  Anyways me and Al walked to Neil's apartment. And when we got there Elliot, and Neil were there. Also Ransom, Vida, Hugo, and Julie. I didn't know them before but throughout the weekend I got to know them and they were pretty cool. Neil's apartment was so cute, the kitchen walls were pink. Anyways we just kind hung around and of course started drinking. I drank about 2 beers and then me and Elliot started doing coke. And basically lasted all weekend. Around 9pm we went to see Bouncing Souls and Loren, Anna, and Alex got there in the middle of it. We get back to Neil's place and did more coke. We basically just hung out, got fucked up and everyone went to sleep at around 5 AM. Elliot took the couch, Loren and Anna took the air matress, Alan the chair, Alex living room floor. I was going to sleep on Neil's floor but he was all nice and stuff and let me sleep with him on his bed. We didn't go to sleep until around 6-ish tho. We talked a lot about journalism and stuff, which was cool. It's always nice to talk to a fellow journalism major. Good conversation, granted that I was fucked up and Neil was trashed. But whatever. We woke up around 1.30, ate a shitload of breakfast food, went back to the apt, and started playing drinking Uno. Anna got so drunk, it was hysterical. There we were at 3 in the afternoon, drunk out of our face. Fun fun fun. After a while, we walked to  Vulture Cock  (new modified name of Culture Shock) and hung out there for a while. We saw Mates of State and Blonde Redhead. Then we walked back to Neil's and get more fucked up. At around midnight we all went out to go to this mud wrestling party, but on the way at the Olde, there was a huge drum circle. Vida told me drum circles happens a lot in Purchase, mostly just a couple of kids with their drumset and cymbals and stuff and a couple people dancing. But this time there were probably around 800 kids out there, some dancing, some just chillin, getting drunk. That was pretty fun. We got back to the apt, hung out some more, got more fucked up, played a 2-hour game of Uno (pure, pure torture) and went to bed ta around 5. On Sunday we woke up around noon, went to eat breakfast, went back to the apt and played one last game of Uno. Me and Anna also did a couple of lines before we left, including one later on at the White Plains train station. Ridiculous. Anyways, we left around 3.30, and got home at around 6-ish. I had so much fun. Holla to Neil for providing us with a place to stay (sorry for any shit we might have and defnitely have caused) and Elliot for the candymandy. I did so much coke this weekend to last me with goodness for about six seven months.  ---- meeting at work--- back. It's 1.40 now, damn that was a long meeting. anyway my weekend was great. i don't necessarily love coke, but it was fun. i probably won't do anymore for a while. i get bored so easily with drugs. i'd have them every now and then and i go on with my life. anyways yesterday we got home at around 6, and I basically passed out on my bed.  also last night Chris told us that he's moving out, which is messed up but whatever. I gotta go do some work now. peace.

      Okay.. it's 4 now. One more hour then I'm getting the fuck out of here. I'm so fucking tired,work this week has been hell, pure hell. Not in a bad way though. I love what I do, and we just finally, finally wrapped this issue. I'm workin on our October issue now and I have to brainstorm some story ideas. It's not a bad way to make (little) money. Anyways right now it is so fucking great outside. The sun was out all day, and it was very summery. Right now it's getting a tiny, tiny bit chillier, which is just the way I like it. The weather ppl say that tomorrow is going to be 70 degrees. Yeah! So this weekend I am going away to Purchase U, to check out   Culture Shock,   their annual music festival. It's called Culture Shock because they have so many different bands/musicians from all different kinds of music and they play right after each other. Like it'll be total emo punk band playing and the next would be this old skool r-b dude. Culture, shock, get it? So I'm leaving my office at 5, I'm going tot ake the train to Grand Central and catch the Metro North there. I have never been to Purchase before, and I'm going there alone so I hope I won't get lost. Alan and Elliot left early this morning and Loren, Alex, and Anna are leaving late at 8-ish cuz Loren and Alex is working late. I was going to leave with them but I didn't want to miss the fucking Bouncing Souls you know, cuz they're playing early. Oh yeah btw, some of the performers:   The Bouncing Souls, Ted Leo and the Pharmacist,   and I forgot who else. Ted Leo is playing early I think so I'm definitely going to miss it, but there's no way I'm missing Bouncing Souls. Argh so excited. I'll be up in Purchase until Sunday. I'm coming back here Sunday morning. It's going to be a shitload of fun because all my friends are going, and I haven't gone away in a while (not that Purchase is really "away"). But we're going to get shitfaced, drink like a manic, I might do a little candy, and just have a blast. I haven't been trashed in a while (well not since the party), and you know what it's always nice to get fucked up sometimes (as long as you know your limits). I know myself and my body well and I know how much I need to be "good" fucked-up, not bad fucked up hehehe. You know I just realized I haven't puked in shit, about two years or so. I used to puke everytime I drink too much. And I drink more often now. Gosh does this make me an alcoholic? Naah.  So anyways, I'm outta here. Gonna finish some last minute stuff. Have a good weekend you non-existent nosy people. Peace!

      Yes yes yes yes yes it's Friday yes yes yes yes yes. Thank God this week is finally over. Okay so anyway- On Thursday, he called me. He said he was sorry for not calling me back. And we talked for a little bit. I'm glad. To be honest I wouldn't have really cared if he would call me back or not. See I'm that kind of person that never calls people back, call it laziness, call it ignorance, but if it's really that important, they will call again. I barely ever, ever use the phone. I suck at the phone. I'm the furthest thing from a being a phone person. Anyways, we talked on Thursday and he had to go, he said he'd try to call me back. He didn't. Ha. I fell asleep anyway after a couple episodes of Family Guy. God I love that fucking show. Smoke a jay with your friends and watch them, it's like everything is alright with the world. So anyways yesterday I was so swamped all day at work. I got home and surprise surprise he called me again. And this time we talked for a good half an hour. With me and him both being horrible with talking on the phone, that's an acomplishment. It was a good talk to. When he comes to B-town next month he'll try to go see me in NY, he said he misses me. God. This fucking guy. I swear it's like the best thing when a guy that is not smooth AT ALL, like no game no mojo, suddenly slipped out something sweet like that. I really like him, and I have the feeling that it's mutual. I mean what's the fucking point of him keep calling me and stuff if he doesn't like me, you know, we live thousands of miles away. God I'm talking like a fucking teenager. It's crazy. Thing is, back in the days I've met a couple of guys that fucked me over that in the past 2 years I've become so jaded when it comes to guys and r-ships. When I look back at the past two years, it was just like this long strecth of empty debauchery. There was a point when I was juggling 4 guys at the same time, for about 2 months. And I enjoyed it at the time. I enjoyed messing with guys. But what always happens is that I met a guy, usually assholes/losers, get tottaly attracted to their loserness and assholeness, start going out with them, and get itchy and bored after about a month, two months top. Then I moved on to the next victim. I liked the casualness, I likedthe emptiness, and I liked the power I had. But since I met him, I'm like going crazy. I don't even know what's going to happen with this guy, might be something, might be nothing, but I kind of like not knowing. I kind of like not having expectations, the whole thrill. But he kind of stopped me in my tracks and hit my right on my face and reminded me what i could have and what I should be doing.  Shit my boss is here. Gotta go.

      Wakakakaw.... it's the end of the day yeah. Okay so I was swamped all day at work. I had to figure out what should be in the next issue, do research, call up some writers, assign stories, bla bla bla. The thing is, how the fuck am I supposed to assign stories about golf if I don't know shit abouy golf? Ugh. The travel section is already filled, and now the gol section is one huge gaping blank. They better hire an editor-in-chief who knows golf or I'm going to kill myself trying to figure it out.   Anyways surprise surprise he called me last night when I was watching the Simpsons. So we said hi, bla bla and then I told him that I won't be able to go visit next weekend. He got kinda pissy and told me that he had to go and that he'd call me back in an hour. He never did. I don't really care. If anything I'm actually a little happy that he got kinda upset, cuz that means he actually wanted me to go see him. Tee-hee. Whatever I'm retarded. What he did tell me though that he is going to be in B-town for a week next month So I asked him if I'm going to see him then, if he's going to drop by NY or sumthin. He said he's going to be really busy but if he did go to NY he'll def. go and see me. I don't know.. I mean I was willing to go across the fucking country to see him and he can't even spare one fucking day to see me while he was in fucking B-town? Ah whatever, now I'm just being crazy. Whatever. I should really just not think about this for a while. It's starting to drive me mad. Anyways it six minutes after five now and I'm outta here. Peace.

      Closing time.... yeah. I'm so fucking tired thank God it's almost 5 I'm about to take off in a minute. So I discovered why I've been so fucking tired and somewhat emotional lately, well today I got a very unexpected non-pleasurable guest visited me. And it's staying for six whole days. Great. I just fucking washed this jeans literally yesterday. Yesterday!! It hasn't even streched out yet. And now it has a tiny little annoying red coochie mark smack down the middle of the crotch waaa. Alright I know I know overshare. Whatever, I hate my period. There were times, well many many many times, in the past where getting my period is like the absolute best fucking thing in the world, but not this time. So anyways, I'm going to go home, take a mini nap or maybe just eat and veg out in front of the tv and take a nice long hot shower and wash my hair. Then I'd start feeling like a human being again. Peace.

      Top of the mornin to ya! Alright so I'm back at the office, and for once I wasn't that late today. i got here at 9.12. Twelve minutes, not bad, feels kinda early hehe. Anyways it's so fucking crappy outside, it's one of those half rain half mist weather. It's like your umbrella doesn't even do the job because the mist fills up the air, sneaks up from under the umbrella and fucks up your hair. I didn't do much last night. i got home at around 6-ish, so tired and rained out. I picked up my laundry and set up camp in front of the tv watching the Miss USA pageant. The one that won, Missouri girl, is so fucking gorgeous. I was disappointed though that the stupid judges picked pretty much all blonds for the top ten. What the fuck was that? They all look the same. And what's with Oklahoma? Justin Timberlake? What are you an idiot? If you only have half a brain at least try to hide it and shut your mouth, fucking retard. Anyways, after the show me and Loren just kind of sat there talking, doing our little girl-bonding thing. We talked about body image and stuff. She's insane. Loren's not a skinny girl, but she's not a big girl either. She is so fucking gorgeous. But she looks at herself through this extremely critical glasses, and beats herself up for it. It's driving me crazy. I mean everybody is a little self concious about their body, but not to the extend that Loren is. I don't know how to make her believe that she is so fucking gorgeous and she should stop freaking out. See it's hard because with me being her best friend, of course she wouldn't believe me. I mean I have my insecurities too, I know I'm (somewhat) skinny, but there are parts of my body that I don't like but you know what, it's okay. When I look into the mirror, I try to focus on the good parts instead of the bad ones, and Lore is the other way around. She's a nut job. I love her though. Aside from that we talked for a while about my trip and stuff. I was going to go to LA next weekend but now I realized that if I go, I'll be broke-ass for two weeks. So now I'm thinking about going about three weeks from now. I am excited about going, and I do want to see him so much. I mean I fucking hate LA, the only reason for me to go is to see him, pretty much. And I know that we will have such a good time too, the only sucky thing is that I know when I go home, I'll be fucking bummed out. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I like this guy so much and even though I'm not like pyscho about him or like dying to be his girlfriend or anything, I'm not sure if by going it will do any good for myself you know. We're so far apart and even though I like him so much I know that our lives are so different right now and nothing can ever happen. But a little part of me wants to know if it's somewhat possible, if something  could  happen. And I'm not sure that he knows that's why I'm going. But what Loren and Alan told me is that, just from the fact that I'm flying thousands of miles away just to see him already says something, and if he didn't want that than he wouldn't have invited me to go see him. I don't know I'm looking too much into this I just need to chill for a little bit. Well this weekend I'm going to Purchase with like a million people for Culture Shock and that would eb a shitload of fun. The Bouncing Souls is playing so that would be fucking amazing. Anyways I need to start working now. Peace.

      Happy belated Easter everyone!  So I'm back at the office, after a long weekend that went by way too fast. Didn't do anything that special. On Thursday chilled at home, Ana and Val came over, we saw the Apprentice haha. I went to church Friday with my aunt and my cousins. It was actually really nice. I haven't gone to church since christmas and I felt kinda bad. But whatever. The only kinda sucky thing was that at the end of mass we had to walk around the block carrying candles and singing songs, which weren't that big of a deal if it weren't for third avenue being crowded by little 15 y/o guidettes staring at us. I almost threw my burning candle at their hair. Friday night me, Lore, Alan, and Alex went to Smith's. Alex crashed that night. On Saturday I walked around 86th street trying to find some decent black pumps. I tried on at least fifteen pairs, and all of them are eithertoo expensive or they don't have my size. All the shoes are 7.5, and I'm a 7. WTF? I did see these gorgeous gorgeous pair of black stiletto pumps at stupid flavour, but they were 65 bucks. And when I went to Century I saw the same pair for 50 bucks, but they didn't have my size. God damn it! Argh. So I ended up not buying anything. Saturday night Alex came round again but we didn't really do anything. We just hung out, smoke some, watch tv, hang out, the usual. And on Sunday i got up early, went to Easter mass with my aunt and Donnie and Sherene, and hung out at their house afterwards. I ate so much. Anyways I better go now cuz I'm at work. Peace.

      Have no time to write- v. busy at work. Just want to pop in and say that I called him last night. I was like.. just making sure you havem't forgotten about me. He was like, don't be silly, you know I want you to come here. Somehow I don't completely believe him. Am I just being paranoid or maybe I'm sensing he is really moving along? God, I'm pathetic. It's not even worth mentioning. So anyways I found out that i couldn't go to the Dominican Republic because my fucking visa expires June 3, three days before the trip ended. Sucks ass. So know I have to find someone, again, to take my place. For once I want to be able to fucking go. Whatever. Anyways I have to go. I have a meeting with the big boss. Good weekend everyone. Peace.

      Yezz it's 4.30. I am about to go home in probably five minutes. Thank God. Today wasn't so bad. The day went by pretty quick. We are almost completely done with this issue and now I'm just kind of in the brainstorming mode, trying to think what stories could go for the next issue. I really want to go on that trip to the Dominican Republic.. I still haven't checked my Visa thing. Since I moved to the other room all my shit is mixed-up and all over the place. Maybe when I start working full time I could switch room with Chris. Argh I'm tired, i don't really have anything to say. I had a chicken roll for lunch and I am still stuffed. I'm going to pack my stuff now and get going. I want a stog so bad. Oh wait this reminds me. So yeah Chris has a gig tonight in good ol burgtown. Me and Lore were going to check it out but we just found out last night that the gig tonight is going to be at Leila. HOLY FUCKING SHIT. Crazy, right? What a small fucking world. There's no way I am going back there after the whole A-fiasco. If he sees me, I don't know what the fuck's going to happen. Scary. Just thinking about me gives me the chills. Alright Ima go. Peace.

      I'm in a pretty good mood today. I had a good sleep, even if it was only 3 hours. I couldn't fall asleep at all last night. Since I switched rooms, I really havn't been able to sleep right. The glares of the street lights are too bright for me, and the noise from the street are a little much. Loren said I'll get used to it but it's been a week already and I still can't sleep. Last night I ended up sleeping on the couch in the living room. The minute I laid down there, with no noise, no annoying lights, I pretty much passed out. Anyways last night was a pretty chill night. I got home, Alan was there, Elisa was cooking him something. Then they all left to have passover dinner. I got Greek food, a beef shish-kebab thing. It was so good. Not long after that Loren got home. She apologized by being a bitch this morning and she actually got a little offended when I told her I got an alarm clock. Oh yeah by the way I got a digital alarm clock at radioshack yesterday. Cheap, and it has the most annoying beeping noises ever. Perfect for me. But whatever, after that I took a good 2 hour nap. I was watching tv in my room and I just kind of passed out. I woke up to Chris walking in the house. I listened to him play some of his songs. They were pretty good. They might not necessarily be my type of music but they're good. He has a really nice voice and solid songwriting skills. We talked for a while after that, about life, about money, pressure, etc. I'm actually really glad that now I have someone that understands how I feel because eventhough Loren and Alan are very understanding, but they're still in school and they're in a different stage of their life right now compared to me. Me and Chris graduated around the same time and we're both struggling to just survive in this fucking city you know. But things are looking good for me. If I get hired for this job full time, then I'll be all set. I really really want this job, and aside from me working my ass every day, I'm actually good at it so they really should hire me or they're idiots. Anyways, Loren got up after a while and we chilled in the living room just talking for hours. We talked about a lot of stuff that I can't really get into right now since I am at work and I should be doing some work, which I will in a minute. I have a long day ahead of me. Oh btw my boss told me I can take off from work on Friday since she won't be here, cuz it's Good Friday. YEAH. Long weekend. Thank God. Anyways I went to be around 3.30ish and here I am.  You know I've been thinking about him lately. And we haven't talk for like 2 weeks now. We usually talk once a week so it is a little weird. I know we're both super busy and I was the one that said was gonna call but I've been swamped. The thing is, because I've been so busy the thoughts of him have kinda been pushed to the back of my head. And it's actually not that bad. I really like him but what the fuck am I going to do anyway, we live so far away. I don't even know if he still thinks about me. It's really weird. I don't know if I should just let this go and not even go there, but I really want to see him and I know we will have SO much fun together. But on the other hand, I know I will go home extra bummed. I don't know if it's worth it for a guy that's not even my boyfriend or anything. Maybe I'm thinking about this too much. He'd think I'm crazy. But whatever, I do feel happy when I'm around him and we had so much fun the last time so come to think of it, why not just have a little bit more fun, right? Anyways. Off to work we go. Peace.

      Alright- 4.30. My bosses left already, and I can't technically leave until its 5 PM so here goes we. I am so hungry right now. Anyways work was alright, not too quiet not oo busy. I found out about this one press trip to the Dominican Republic. I really, really, really want to go. I think I might eb able to go, depending on when my visa expires. If my visa expires after June 10, then I def. can go. If it expires before that, than I can go but then I can't come back into the US waaa =(. Anyways I'll figure it out when I get home. Plus, they might want to send someone else anyway. Although if they send me, not only will they get one fucking great story, they won't have to pay me. We'll see. Argh I really want to go. I never been to the DR, there's so much I can write about. Another thing about work, so I think they're hiring an EIC and he sounds pretty great. I hope he likes me and vice versa because we're going to be working together like non-stop. He better be good. I'm wondering when the fuck are they going to hire me? This temporary hourly salary sucks. I want real income, with benefits. Anyways, enough about work.  So I'm looking forward to going home. I'm going to get some food, maybe Greek. Eat and watch TV, took a nap, and then Loren will get home and scream at me for this morning. Oh I know, maybe I'll go get an alarm clock before I go home, so I can throw hers at her face. Hmm. I'm kidding.  So I'm thinking about Him a lot lately. I haven't talked to him in two weeks. I know I saw I was going to call, but he could've called. Maybe he finally forgotten about me? Impossible. I'll call him on Wednesday or something and tell him that I'm going to visit him at the end of this month. He's going to be thrilled. He said if I go see him he'll take good care of me. Yumm. Okay Ima go now. Gotta stop at the bank and get some money for my stupid alarm clock, stogs, and food. Great, that's 20 bucks right there. I'm so broke.

      Aaah, another day in the office. Blah. So last night about twenty people came to our place, drank, smoked, played music, and stuff. It was basically our last chill-night with Kev before he has to go back to Tennesee tomorrow, er, today. Totally sucks. I won't even get to see him today because his plane is leaving this afternoon, and I'll be here working. Anyways last night was kind of a blur. It started out pretty good. Loren made pasta and meatballs, all from scratch, and it was fucking fantastic. She rarely ever, ever, cooked so that was pretty impressive. I stuffed myself retarded. I feel like fucking meatwad from the Aquatine Hunger Force. After that we just sat around having stogs watching TV. We actually watched the whole 2 hour finale of Average Joe Adam Returns. I have never even seent hat show before. I kind of lost interest in TV after Top Model ended. Come back and fill the void in my life Tyra and bitchy model-wannabes! Anyways, then everyone started coming over and as usual we get somewhat fucked up. I felt bad because I had to go to sleep early, around 2.30, but if I stayed up later I wouldn't have been able to get up this morning. I think everyone was there until around 4, I don't even know. Chris was playing Beatles songs on hus guitar all night and a bunch of ppl were singing along. It was kinda cool. Anyways so I woke up this morning an hour later than I was supposed to, jumped into the shower, and at about 8.30, just before I was going to leave I realized that I was supposed to wake Loren up at 7.30. So I woke her up and she flipped out on me, understandably, but she acted like a total bitch. She was like, okay, that's it, no more, this is the second time in a row you made me late, I'm taking my alarm clock back! First of all, the first one was about two weeks ago and jeez I didn't think it was such a big deal. I fucking overslept. Second of all, the only reason I have her stupid fucking alarm clock was because she didn't get up to that anyway, she only get up from me screaming at her. Whatever. I know it was totally my fault for forgetting to wake her up and I do feel bad for it. I told her I was sorry but she fucking flipped out on me. Wtf? Fucking unnecessary bitchiness in the morning, I hate it. I love her with all my heart but sometimes I just can't stand with her fucking bitch-mode on-off-on-off thing. The little fucking tantrums are starting to drive me crazy I can't deal with it. She pulls this crap all the time, to me, the Alan, and at the end of the day she'll go to us and be like, hun I'm sorry I was such a bitch this morning. If she really was sorry she should really fucking stop for a minute to think before she opens her mouth, because the little hissy-fits: not cool. Whatever. I do love her so much, she's my best friend. But she's just not the best roomate. I'm just ranting. Anyways I have a meeting coming up now, we have to talk about what we want to have for the next issue so I better jet. Peace.

      So.. finally got a new blog. My old one is flooded with crap. I'm at work right now, should be doing some work but it's already four thirty, I just want to go home already. So anyways, my weekend was pretty good. On Thursday I went to Park Slope with Loren, Anna, Kev, etc. We went to a pizzaria and I had a chicken roll and grape soda. V. good. After that we just kinda hung around the van for a while, talking about stuff. There was a little bit of drama going around the group and we spent a bit of time talking about it, smoking stogs by the van until we froze our asses and got into the van and left. Friday I went to work with Elisa for about four hours. I got up on time but then after getting ready I fell asleep on the couch. I ended spending thirteen bucks for cab, but whatever I got there on time and I got paid. I took the train back home and chilled for a bit till Loren got home. I took a nap and then a bunch of my friends came over. We just chilled in the place, smoking, drinking beer, the usuals. Oh we ended up playing this alphabet/movie game for seriously three hours. It was pretty funny. Anyways on Saturday we threw a party. About seventy people came, the usual crowd. I had a shitload of fun, cuz I haven't seen some of those people in a while. Chris moved in that night too and he meshed well with our friends which was cool. I heard that everyone really liked him, including a certain someone that gave him her number. Too bad Loren doesn't like her. Anyways, I was pretty much wasted during the whole party. Julie brought some midori and I was mixing Midori Sours.. yumm. And another thing that was cool was that when me and some other ppl were hanging out on the fire escape, I walked over to the empty apartment's window next door and discovered that it wasn't locked. I opened it, walked around inside. It was mad cool the place looked so deserted and kinda creepy actually. There was a HUGE American flag, painted on the walls surrounding the living room. Fucking crazy. Maybe there was some crazy guy ala Ed Norton in American History X living there before. Brr. Anyways Sunday was as usual, cleaning day. Alex crashed, he pretty much hogged my blanket all night. I wanted to kick him off the floor, but I was too trashed to do it haha. I'm glad that Alex's been hanging around, cuz the house is not the same without him. We all miss having him around. Anyways we cleaned the house, I cooked some righteous chicken teriyaki and smoke some more, watched Aquatine Hunger Force, and some Family Guy. Then I went to bed. I couldn't fall asleep tho, I didn't know what it was. I woke up at least 15 time throughout the night, then at around 6 AM I just kinda gave up and watched the alarm clock until it went off. And of course after I finished getting ready, I sat on the couch smoking a stog and what do you know I fell asleep on the fucking couch again. Argh. I was half an hour late to work today. But whatever. Anyways it's almost 5 I think I'm just gonna take off. Peace.

        EvilChinaDoll's Crew      &nbsp;   The following are my minions..or victims...according to the likeness of my heart. Nah, these ppl are my close friends, borderline family. Without them my life would be very, very clean and boring. &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;        This is  Loren.  She is my bestfriend and roomate. We fight a lot but it's always out of love. Loren's really good at: making you laugh, givng the best back massage ever, sleeping, spending money, and screaming.&nbsp; She's very depended on me and it drives me crazy sometimes, but without her my life would suck really&nbsp;bad.&nbsp; Loren's currently an art student that's taking a long break.    Last&nbsp;memorable thing Loren said:&nbsp; (talking about a guy she made out with)    "Yeah he's kinda cute...kinda like...like..a little pig.". &nbsp;    &nbsp;        This is  Anna.  Anna is a very, very close friend of mine. She's is one gorgeous sex goddess.&nbsp; Me, Loren, and Anna will be moving in together in November. Anna's also an art student that's taking a break. She paints these amazing big ass paintings.    Last memorable thing Anna said:    &nbsp;"Argh! I'm dating a FUCKING YUPPIE!!" &nbsp;    &nbsp;        This is  Val.  Val is my girl. She's sweet, honest, and she knows all my secrets. Val and Sehad have been going out for about four years, and they're still sickeningly all over each other. Val, the rock start that she is, just got accepted to a v. exclusive radiology school. She will make a shitload of money and I will forever ask her for loans.    Last&nbsp;memorable thing Val said: (talking about a girlfriend of our friend, before they were introduced, she had no clue who she was)    "Oh my god, that girl is busted! She's painful to look at." &nbsp;    &nbsp;        This is  Alex.  Alex is one weird, smart, awkward, lovable guy. We used to be roomates but now he's slumming it in Boro Park. Alex reminds me a lot of my little brother, except for the fact that my brother is not a dirty russian who's socially inept.&nbsp;Kidding. Alex hands down has the best cd collection. Alex currently works at a graphic design company and he's a full time hater.    Last&nbsp;memorable thing Alex said: (drunk, on the streets of downtown Manhattan, around 4 in the morning)    "Fuck you hipsters! Get out of my city!! This city has lost its individuality. Aaaargh!"&nbsp;     &nbsp;        This is  Alan.  Alan is a v. unique individual. He's chill but moody, he's calm but very sensitive, he's anal but messy, he's lovable and loatheable. But when it comes down to it, you can always count on Alan to cheer you up. This dude has the most positive outlook on life.    Last&nbsp;memorable &nbsp;thing Alan said: &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;          This is  Elliott.  Elliott is a big man whore. Nah, Elliott seems like a shy person at first, but he’s really not. He’s very smart and fun to be around. He can be a little awkward sometimes, but when it comes down to it, he’s cool, and always down to party. Elliott currently just chillin’.  Last memorable thing Elliott said:    &nbsp;       This is  Sehad.  Sehad is Alex’s childhood friend. Sehad is probably one of my favorite people in the world. He is the most honest person I know, no games, no bullshit, this kid has a heart of gold. He’s also very fucking funny. Currently Sehad is going to school for graphic design/ animation and pleasing Val.  Last memorable thing Sehad said:     &nbsp;        This is  Neal.  Neal's Elliott's and Alan's friend from Purchase. He still goes to school there but in the summer esp. he still hangs out a lot. Neal's a weird guy. He's simple and complicated at the same time. I really think he loves mysery. But Neal likes to party too, when you get him in the right mood. He can drinks like noone else. Then again he's Irish. Neal currently studies print journalism.    Last memorable thing Neal said:

      Tuesday. Didn't go to work yesterday. Too hungover. Alright.. weekend recap.  Friday. Met up with Elliot. Went to South Street Seaport. We checked out the massage-chair, was awesome, as expected. We looked around other stuff at The Sharper Image. That was pretty fun. It's amazing how human beings can come up with the craziest shit to allow themselves to be lazier and lazier. After that we went to Victoria's Secret. I bought some underwear. Mainly because it was getting close to laundry day and I sure as hell weren't gonna do it. After that we went to check out this store that sells posters. I got a Japanese A Clockwork Orange poster and a french nouveau-style spanish poster that advertises parisian cigarettes. I'm going to hang them in my room, cuz I'm thinking about taking down the painting that Lore did of me. I like it but crazy me I feel like it's narcisistic to have a huge painting of myself in my room, even if it was a gift. But I don't know. Who gives a flying fuck. I like the painting and I guess I am a little narcisistic. Go me! Anyways after that we went to eat at the food court (the whole day was a total mall experience) and then we went to Express, where Elliot totally jacked an awesome belt buckle. he's going to hell, and I guess I am too since I was kind of an accomplice. Then we went into this awesome little store called Neighborhoodies. I don't know if you guys know it but they're awesome. It's a clothing company that sells shit that you can customize. They're primarily an online store but they just opened that one store in NY. Elliot got a shirt that says Grand Army Plaza, and I got this red and white short-shorts. I had Raw 86th Street written on the back haha. I was wearing them all weekend, including times when I had to leave the house to go to the deli or sumthin. Now all the guys at the deli are totally in love with me and they hook me up with free shit. They prob. just want to tap my ass, but whatever. Free bagels rock. So after that we went back to my apt. Chilled for a little bit and then we left to go to Smith's. Alan, Elisa, Alex, Luke, Allison, Val, Seyhod (who came later but I was too trashed to remember at that point), and of course Loren and Elliot. We got there, Rob, our awesome bartender were hooking me up with some free beers, and Elisa bought me a couple, and we had tequila shots and stuff. We got there at around 11 and by 2 am I was trashed. I completely don't remember the rest of the night but it's safe to say that I was being stupid.  Saturday. We were planning to go out but we ended up staying in at the apt. Neal and Alexi came over, in addition to all the people that we hung out with yesterday. We went to the roof, smoke a lot of pot and chilled. It was funny, at one point everyone were just kind of quiet and listening to the music and Seyhod told Val,"I wish we can stay up here forever." It was hysterical. He was being totally serious but the way he said it was just so mushy it was great. Anyways we all just kinda hung out, I stayed up until around 6 and then I passed out. Elliot and Alex crashed.   Sunday. Me and Loren went out to go look at some air conditioners. we went to PC Richards, looked around but didn't buy anything. We then went to Century, where I was going to buy a rug for my room but the only ones they have were nasty old ppl carpets. Then with 15 minutes left before the store closes we ran into the shoes sectiona nd what the fuck I bought a pair of shoes. Argh. I can't leave shoes alone wtf wtf. I bought a pair or white and silver pointy toe slingbacks for 35 bucks, which weren't bad. Anyways Sunday night we cleaned the house. The place was looking so fucking disqusting. I don't even know how we managed to live on our filth for weeks. After that we got so bored and started drinking. I got a little drunk, started drunk dialing etc.etc. and then at around 2.30am Luke, Scott, and Seyhod came over with a cooler of beer. T'was great. I got so trashed, did some stupid things, etc. and then passed out around 5.30.   Monday. Woke up at 9.30, called out from work, went back to sleep. Then I went out and went food shoppind. I made teriyaki steak and chicken kebabs, with grilled peppers, scallions, and onions. so fucking good, then later on that night Anna, Marcello, and Alex came over. We smoked, drank, and then we played Truth (Dare) or Dare. The game started out tame but after a while it just went crazy. It turned into a girls against guys kinda thing. The guys made us dance to some stupid music and shaked our booty, so we made them act out a threesome/manwich thing while dancing to hip hop. Great. Also, I sold my turntables and mixer to Marcello and now I have an extra 60 bucks in my pocket. Hells yeah. I never use them anymore anyways.   Anyways so now here I am, at work, tired froma 5 day drinking binge. I have to stop destroying my brain cells. But it's so fucking good. So far work is going pretty good. I don't know why but during our editorial meeting I suddenly just started blabbering about how we can improve our website and shit and before I know it I now have to create some mock designs and do a presentation on Thursday. Fucking A. My stupid mouth.  One interesting happened this weekend tho. I think I have mentioned before about this one guy from LA that I was talking to. Let me tell you a little background story. His name is Jordan. We met at this New Year's party I went to. We met at the party, at someone's place in the East Village, and basically were making out the whole time. I gave him my number, he called me the next day and we swapped screennames (stupid 21st century flirting, what happened to old-fashioned courtship?). After that we talked online every now and then, prob. about once every 1/2 weeks. We talked online for hours, which was good. Oh I should mention that at the time he lived in Boston (which explains why we did the online thing instead of actually going out). We don't really talk on the phone that much. I am HORRIBLE with phone conversations, and he's almost as bad. When we talked on the phone, it sucks ass. I didn't know what to say, tons of awkward silences, we fell asleep, etc etc. Anyways, after a while he told me that he was moving to LA to pursue music. Cliche. But cool. Whatever. Anyways he told me before he left to LA he was going to go to NY and visit me. And he did. He came to NY about 3 days before he was leaving to LA. We met up, hung out, and had the best time ever. I have to say it was probably hands down one of the best dates I ever had. We met up after I got off from work, went to a bar, drank, played pool, went back to my place, had (v.good) sex, woke up, went to a diner for breakfast, hung out around my neighborhood, went to the city to his friend's place to pick up his stuff, went to penn station, and then he left. Basically it was great. You know before he came to NY, when he told me he was coming I was basically just thought of it as you know, a one night stand. He's leaving anyways, he's cute, why the fuck not. But then we spent the whole day together and it was so cool. Anyways after that he left and since then, I think this is two months ago, we've been talking on the phone. I don't usually call him, but he calls me from LA about once a week. I was planning to go to LA to visit him and stuff but I just kind of didn't have the time. Anyways, we've been like flirting, talking and stuff on the phone for two months now, and I do want to see him. I'm not expecting anythin at all from him, I mean it's ridiculous, look at where I am and where he is. I probably shouldn't even talk to him anymore after he left, since he's there and I'm here and it's retarded; but I like him a lot. Whatever. So the weird thing was he called me Saturday night, and we were just talking as usual, and then he told me that's he's been seeing a girl that apparently he met one day after he hung out with me in NY, and they're dating now. See this would've been fine and stuff, I mean I don't care you know, but then he says he misses me and stuff and that he wants me to go to LA and hang out with him, etc. which I think was kind of weird. I mean I would love to go and I probably would, but it just surprises me that he's dating this girl and he still wants to whatever you know with me. I mean it's not bad or anything but just surprising. Argh whatever. Alright I better do some work.

      Alright.. It's almost 5pm and it's Friday. I'm getting the hell out. Quick recap about yesterday: Got home from work around 6. Took a nap. Ate. Alec came over. Smoked. Got really stoned. Went to bed. Easy huh. Well work was alright today. I was an hour late. I don't think anybody cared though, to be honest. They prob. thought I had to do some reporting this morning or something. Anyways. So I'm meeting Elliot at 5.30 at the South Street Seaport today. I'm going with him to check out this awesome massage lounge chair that Marco bought. Elliot wanted one. They have it at The Sharper Image. That should be a lot of fun. They always have weird stuff in there. Also good point of the day: I got paid. Yeay yeay yeay. Tonight I am going to spit on all my ramen noodles and buy some actually food YEAH. Okay, so weekend plans: nothing out of the ordinary. Tonight everybody is coming over, then we're going to Smith's, and then we'll prob. come back to the apt and get more fucked up. Tomorrow I'm meeting my aunt in the city. She's taking me dress-shopping for my job's launch event. It's really nice of her. I kinda wanted to chinese silk dresses with the high collar. I want one that's black with white designs on it, knee-length and high slits on the side. See they have a lot of those in Chinatown. But I'm thinking, would it be overkill if I wear a chinese dress, with me being Asian and all? I don't want to be oriental-planet walking around the party. Hmm. Loren said I can because I look spanish. (wha?) haha. We'll see. Anyways I'm gonna go. Below is a quiz I did on quizilla called What's Your Sexual Appeal? I love these quizzes, I know it's dorky fuck you I don't care. Anyways check out the results: I obviously rock. Too bad in real life men don't fall on my feet and beg me to be their sex/love master/queen. Alright. Have a good weekend. And special shout-out to Mr.Brush, my fellow blogger, feel better!      Tomboy    urlLink   What's your sexual appeal?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Hmmph. Bgh. Blagr. Arr. I am hungover. Shit shit shit shit. My head hurts and I feel like crap. In a good way, though (?). Alright let's get started.  So yesterday I got home from work around whatever. Everyone were home. Chris was napping, Alan and Loren were chillin in the living room. I was in such a crappy mood yesterday so I kinda retreated to my room. I was there for about an hour, putting pictures on my photo cork board. Then things started getting weird. Loren and Alan ambushed me. They went to my room, sat on my bed and basically just hung out and talked me silly. I started to be in a better mood (God I love my friends) and suddenly Loren suggested that we either get high, or get a six-pack. We decided with the latter. We have no house stash of pot, and Alex was too lazy to come by, little shitlin. So, the problem was, me and Loren were both extremely broke. Anyways so Alan lent us money for the beer and off we go. We got trashed. Trashed trashed trashed trashed. We called some peeps over and all four of us were drinking in my room. We also played drinking Uno. Christ this morning my room looked like a fucking brewery exploded in there. Great. Whatever. Anyways we were drinking for hours and before I know it hmm I was having drunk sex. Again. Damn it. This is like the second time in what two weeks? How pathetic. Anyways it was really good and stuff. Again, for their own good I will not mention names that might be a little controvesial but anyways I got some ass last night. Hahaha. Afterwards I passed out. Prob. around 5.30 or sumthin. Btw during the later half of the night, while I was busy with my own thing, Loren was on the roof with HER own thing. She didn't fuck or anything.. but I saw them making out like crazy. Good for her. This morning when I woke up, Loren was asleep on the couch, and the bottoms of her feet were black. Apparently she forgot to put shoes on when she went to the roof last night. Anyways. I woke up this morning at 9.30. I was supposed to be at work at 9. And my commute to work is an hour (by train). See I prob. would've gotten freaked out about it under normal circumstances but I was too weak and hungover to even make a fuss. I went online, wrote my boss and email saying some bullshit lie, then ate half a chicken roll (leftovers), smoke an obscene amount of stogs, took a half hour nap, took a shower, and got to work at noon. And here I am now, tired, hungover (maybe still a little drunk), pretending like I'm working.   And now I officially have nothing to say. I can't even fucking think. Let's see... okay. I'm going to make a list of things that I really want. Here goes:   EvilChinaDoll's Fantasy Wish List   - Canon digital camera, and that mini awesome express printer that they have. - A laptop. I want a Mac Powerbook. I think that's what it's called. - An insane amount of bikinis and lingerie. - Another tattoo. - A greencard. - A trip home. - An unlimited amount of alcohol, pot, coke, etc. - A trust fund. - A shopping spree at Barnes & Noble. - Brad Pitt's dick on my face. Hahaha. I sounded like a guy. I mean, a wonderful dinner, a movie, and all-nite lovemaking with him. - Vacation by the beach, maybe those beaches in LA. Venice, Malibu, Santa Monica, whatever. I want to lay down on a lounge chair at the beach, with a white string bikini on, a cig/joint on one hand, and a frozen margarita/ice cold bud on my other hand. And Brad Pitt's dick on my face. Hehe. Kidding. - A couple hours worth of cleaning service. I want them to come and make my apartment looks insanely clean.  Yeah making the list wasn't as fun as I thought it would be. That still required a lot of thinking. Alright I'm just gonna go. Ima bang my head on the wall and see if that'll stop the spinning. Peace.

      Okay, it's Wednesday. I'm at work, and I'm so fucking hungry right now.  Let's see..what's been happening? Nothing much. The last couple of days I haven't done much. I've been slacking off at work, not going out (due to the no money situation), and been holed up in my room, setting things, hanging shit up, looking at pictures, etc. I think I've just been wanting some alone time lately, and now that I got my room back, yeay.  I've been feeling kinda down in the past couple of days, it's really weird. I mean, I am clinically depressed, diagnosed by the great people at Columbia University hospital (re: sarcasm); but I've been getting better. Sicne I got back from jakarta in October, things have been improving. I moved out out my old place, got my own place, got a job, etc. etc. I've been trying hard and things have been looking pretty good lately. But for the past couple of days I don't know why but I feel like I'm in a rut. I feel bored all the time, uninterested, tired, etc. I don't know what it is. I feel like maybe it's either because I need a change, do something crazy, something different, or maybe because I feel lonely sometimes. My family is so far away, and we are so tight, esp. me and my mom. It sucks. And I am not there to watch and be a part of my 5 year old brother growing up. Ugh. Also, eventhough I hardly ever complain about meeting guys and stuff, I do want to meet someone that's I don't know, means something to me. I've been in serious relationships, been in love, been heartbroken, been in a dating debauchery, had one night stands, dated more than one (or two) guys at the same time, etc., just like any other normal 23 year old girl. And through all that, although I am grateful for the experiences and memories theyve given me, I was and still am so bored. I mean, I don't think I'm ready yet for another serious relationship, or maybe I am, I don't know. But at least I want to meet someone cool, someone that means something, whatever. I've been watching too many indie flicks I think, now I'm craving for one of those crazy, super intense, mad kind of relationship. Maybe I should move to like Spain or something, get a villa by the beach, or a room with a simple bed, a typewriter (or a laptop) and mimbo name Jorge. Argh. Whatever. Anyways, the other thing is, I think one of the reasons why I'm feeling so crappy is this work thing. Granted I love my job and I fucking enjoy it, the whole 9 to 5 thing is something new to me. I know it's normal and everyone has to do it (unless you're a rich little trustfunder or sumthin), but it's starting to get to me. I hate the routinity, the droning daily shit. I hate having to wake up at a certain time every single day, having a limited time to shower, to have lunch, to smoke cigs, etc. I don't know, maybe I'm just spoiled? None of the jobs I have in the passed have been a 9-5 thing. I mean I worked jobs where I work about 50-60 hours a week, but it's different. This 9-5 thing is making me feel like a robot, I feel dull, I feel boring, inhuman. And now I feel whiny, haha.  Alright, time to switch it up a little.  Alright, remember I was trying to figure out what I wanted to dress up as for our costume party? Where I was originally planning to be O-Ren Ishii from Kill Bill, as pictured:     But then I realized that it's going to be scorching hot and that would be stupid. Soo...I have decided that I will dress up as Alex from A Clockwork Orange for the party.  On my list of things to get is: a derby hat, a cane, white suspenders (I have the white pants and shirt), black boots, and a jock strap with a hard cup. And oh fake eyelashes and face paint. Huhu that should be fun. Here are some pics of Alex:         And a cute Bart's Alex:      Alright. I better go. Ima eat some lunch and do some work. I shall leave you with some pictures of Brad Pitt I stumbled into on the Rolling Stone website. Is it weird that these pics really turn me on? Peace!

      Alright.. get ready for another weekend recap. You know, I also enjoy my weekends. I work hard during the day, and then I get real fucked up during the weekend with all my friends. It's really a lot of fun and I enjoy writing about it because of course it is my journal afterall. But sometimes I wonder about you people that just happens to stumble into my journal. You guys must get so bored reading about me getting drunk/stoned all the time. Oh well.   Friday. Went home. Keep in mind that I was broke and still am completely broke. Was going to go to Alex's work shindig but decided not to. Watched TV. Later on, Loren came home. Elliot came by with Neil. He just got back from Purchase and staying in Brooklyn for the whole summer. It's good to see him. Later after that Alan came home, and Alex also came by. We started drinking, getting kinda drunk, and then when Alex came we all decided to go on the roof and smoke a blunt. It was so fucking nice out and we just chilled on the roof, with a guitar. (By the way I've decided to learn how to play the guitar, and Alan's teaching me. It's mad hard but I think I'm catching on fast. Alan gave me a guitar book (not a beginner's one) and he kinda left me alone with it. Now I have no clue how to read music and shit but I learned and at the end of that first day, I could play Ode to Joy hahaha. My goal is that at the end of the summer I want to know how to play some Radiohead and Oasis songs.) Anyways, we smoked on the roof and then Anna and Marcello came to the house around 2 AM. We all chilled on the roof. Basically not long after that I passed out on the couch and everyone had to sit on the floor cuz I didn't wanna move and shit. I woke up Saturday around 7 AM, realizing that I was supposed to go to Saratoga that morning at 6 AM. My aunts had left already so no Saratoga for me. Yeay.  Saturday. At this point I was even more broke. So sad. I had just enough money to buy stogs and some beer. So anyways Val and Anna came by during the day. Anna just got into a fight with her dad and stuff so she came by to rant. She was crying and shit, I feel really bad. Her parents are just horrible, they're really weird too. Thet're mad abusive and they don't talk to each other for months and then once they make up they ganged up on Anna, and then they fight again, break up, get back together etc etc. I'm not going into details with with it yeah it sucks. I really feel that some ppl are just not meant to be parents and now the kids suffer.  Anyways, me, Anna, and Val played scrabble, then we went for a walk to the water. We stopped by at the Gap an Marco was working there. Anyways we went back to the house and Elliot was already there with movies. He brought Serpico, Philadelphia, and my all time favorite, A Clockwork Orange. Anyways we came back to the house, drank some beer and by midnight there were a lot of ppl there. Alan and Alex, who were supposed to go double-dating hung out with us instead, and Marco came by. SO there were me, loren, Anna, val, Marco, elliot, Alan, and alex. So we were all drinking and then it started pouring outside. So.. Alex rolled a blunt and then we all decided to go up to the roof to hang out and smoke in the rain. That was fucking great. We all just chilled in the rain, and we had one umbrella for the blunt. Wherever the blunt goes, the umbrella goes with it.  We then played DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE for like an hour. It was so much fun.  Anyways after that we all came back down, smoked some more, hung out and talked. Elliot was recording us with his camcorder. He's planning to make a short film out of us. that should be fun. Anyways at around 3 am, Anna and Val went home, and the rest of us walked to Marco's place. His place was pimped out, we all took turns sitting on the super massage chair. Man oh man that chair is fucking sweet. Anyways we then started watching Serpico. We all got kinda bored towards the end. We left marco's at almost 6 Am. Alex left. Loren passed out. Me, Alan, and Elliot went back to roof, hang out, smoke some more pot, etc. Me and Elliot smoked so much pot that we reached what Elliot (and Neil) called as MarijuanaPsychosis, where you kinda od-ed on pot. It was crazy haha. Of course then Alan and Elliot decided to be assholes and sent me downstairs to the bagel store to get food. And so there I was, at 7 o'clock in a Sunday morning, fully cracked out, strung out, and stoned out of my fucking face, ordering food at the bagel store. I messed up all the orders of course, and for some reason I went deaf  and I couldn't hear what the deli guy was saying so we were screaming to each other like fucking maniacs and he was laughing at me. There were four people in line behind me and they were hysterical too. It went kinda like this:  Me: HGKDHKHkajhdadhad (walking into the store, half stumbling on the chairs) Me: (almost inaudible) Can I get.. (clears throat) (without realizing, half screaming) Can I get .. oh I'm sorry.. (normal voice, completely embarassed).. can I get two sandwiches please? DeliDude (DD): Sure. What'd you like. Me: Okay, the first one is buffalo chicken sandwich with melted american cheese. DD: I'm sorry we don't have buffalo chicken. Me: (panicking, because it was elliot's order) err.. .... (an older couple walked in the door, gave me a funny look and waited)... Me: Um.. is the BBQ chicken similar to bufalo chicken? DD: Not really. Me: That's fine. DD: What? Me: Nevermind. DD: You want to start with the other sandwich first? Me: (Even more embarassed) Yes, please (inaudibily) Me: (clears throat).. Can I (almost screaming).. (laughs to self).. (Normal voice).. Can I get a turkey on a plain roll with lettuce, tomate, red onions, and tons of mayo? DD: No problen. .... (the couple waiting started looking at me inpatiently, and two other ppl walked in the store) DD: Okay, what about the other sandwich? Me: Um.. yes.. (thinking) DD: I'm sorry, sir. I'd be right with you. (said deli guy to the guy behind me, kinda laughing at me at the same time). Me: Okay just give me BBQ chicken. DD: Okay. With melted american cheese, right? Me: Yup. .....(DD making the sandwich, me cursing at Alan and Elliot inaudibly) DD: We have no american cheese, miss. I'm sorry. Me: What the... (realized and stopped). Okay.. umm.. um.. um...... pepperjack? DD: Nope. Me: Havarti? DD: Nope. Me: Munster? DD: Yup. Me: Thank God. .....(making the sandwich)... Me: (fixated on the plastic muffins they used to decorate the counter)... DD: (from across the room, standing by the microwave) ".......?" (inaudibly) Me: I'm sorry? DD: ".........!" (still couldn't hear him) Me: WHAT? (screaming) DD: "Melted?!!" (screaming) Me: Yeah! (screaming) ...........people on line laughing out loud at me............ Anyways, after that I was pretty much done. So I left and went back to the place,  and cursed at Alan and Elliot.  Man, I was so embarassed. Whatever. Anyways after that we ate, then smoked some more. And I passed out around 9. I woke up at 11 to pee and Elliot was gone already. Alan was asleep on the couch.  Sunday, nothing much. Me, Lore, Alan, and Chris hung out. Alex came by for a couple hours. And then we started moving. Me, Chris, and Lore switched rooms and now I'm back to my old room. YEAH! I had the best sleep last night, ever. It was great. Anyways this is getting insanely long. I better get back to work. Peace out.

      Alright.. so you know, as much as I love meeting new people, I hate it when they ask me where I'm from and I told 'em a bit about my story ("Born and raised in jakarta, indonesia, moved to NY five years ago, bla bla") and they're like "Wow, you moved to NY by yourself from there? You must've experienced culture shock huh. Bet you never seen anything like NYC." Okay, first of all, no I didn't go no culture shock, two, if you're actually smart and knows a little tiny bit about Jakarta, you know that Jakarta is an ultra-modern city, with 10 million people living in it, and the size of the city is smaller than NYC. In Jakarta, we do have skyscrapers, we do have public transportation, we do have electricity (some guy actually ask), cars, etc. In Jakarta, we do not live in huts or primitive house-like caves, we do not bathe in the river, we do not have chickens crawling everywhere in the city, and we do not have bombs exploding in our faces every single day (Thank God). Indonesia is a very big country, and esp. nowadays it's nott he safest place to visit. There are political problems, there are problems with the economy, the government, terrorists, just like any other developing country. But where I come from, esp. in Jakarta, surprise surprise we are very civilised, modern, and educated. So if one more fucking person asks me how it must fucking feel for me to move from Jakarta to NY and see skyscrapers and all that technology, I'm going to flip the fuck out. Do your research.  On a lighter note, here are some pictures of places I've been to in Indonesia. Most of these places are in Java, where Jakarta is located at, but some of the pics are from Bali, which I used to visit once in a while. I miss them so much. Anyways, check out these pics. Fucking USA looks like shit compared to this. Alright maybe just NY. I love NY though. Peace!  Central Jakarta at night:      Jakarta during the day:      Shopping center in Jakarta (there are a shitload of these kind of places all around town):      Anyer Beach, one hour from Jakarta, where I used to go a lot:      Borobudur, the biggest budhist temple in the world and one of the seven wonders of the world, in Java.      Prambanan, a group of Hindu temples, also in Java.      Tanah Lot, a Hindu temple on a tiny island/big rock by a Bali coast.      A Hindu ceremony at Kuta Beach, Bali.      Rice terraces in Bali. Yumm. I love rice.

      So I changed the ol' journal layout to this one. This whole Blogger new look thing is kinda cool. The templates they have for the layout are actually not bad. Em.. not that I care that much.. em... seriously. Okay. Moving on.. It's Friday and I'm in love. No I wish. Okay.. so what have I been doing. Man you know this is going to be one of those posts that doesn't make sense whatsoever. Okay I'm just going to make a list of my thoughts. It's an homage to Alan, my list-writing lovable freak of a roomate. Here goes:  -Work stuff. The printers finally dropped offthe first issue copies in our hands early this week. It's pretty fucking good. I brought it home and show it to all my friends and granted that they're not golf fans and editorially they prob don't really care, but overall they all said that the mag. looks real good. YEAH. It really does. It's my baby. I've been working on it for months already and now that I have it in my hands.. it's a pretty insane feeling. I saw my name on the masthead and shit, and my name Is pretty close to the top. Sick. Ima send a couple copies to my parents back home so they can gloat to all their annoying little friends.  -TVland. Sad that TV takes the the number two spot on this list but hey the list is not in any kind of order and it just kinda popped in my head. Let's see. Last night I saw the season finale of Frasier, which was cute but overall sucked, and the season finale of ER which was fun and gory and stuff but I was so detached from the show at that time because I was stoned. I saw an episode of The Bachelor called The Women Tell All. That's prob. the first time I've seen the show in well, never. But anyways those chicks are fierce! So funny they were attacking this one girl because supposedly she's a golddigger, and bad and slutty and shit. They showed a footage when they were playing truth or dare (no shit) and they asked each other how many of them can count the ppl they slept with, with one hand.. two hands.. so forth so forth. So this "golddigging" chick was the only one that kept going after the two-hands thing, and everyone was like "GASP! YOU SLUT!" Come the fuck on! It's so crazy. Fucking crazy prudes. You can't hate a girl if she gets more ass than you, you ugly, pathetic losers. Anyways.. what else. That was pretty much it. Oh yeah one more thing, the fucking Lakers game was so intense. I can't believe fucking Fisher made the shot with like 0.something second left in the game and won the game with ONE point. My poor Spurs..BAAAA. I lost five bucks to Alex. Five bucks is fucking food yo. Unfuckingbelievable.  -hmm what else. Oh about a couple of days ago I played Scrabble with Chris and DUDE that kid is insane. I didn't know that he's that fucking competitive. Crazy. He was arguing for like twenty minutes, seriously, that Dozer is an acceptable scrabble word. Of course, because it it was acceptable he would've gotten like 48 points and kicked my ass. But it's not a fucking word. What's wrong with him. Also he didn't believe me that NIX is a word, even though it's in the fucking dictionary with like seven meanings. Crazy fuck. He got me so worked up the only reason why I continued playing was the happy thoughts in my head of me putting his head into a massive meat grinder and feed it to the dogs.  Humpgh. Anyways, that was that. Intense, intense game. And it doesn't matter who won (speaking like a true loser - I lost by two points fuck fuck fuck I'm smarter than him wtf).  Anyways I would love to continue and I could go on and on but it's fucking five minutes to five and I'm getting my ass out of here. Tonight all of us are supposed to go to this bar by Times Square (ew Times Square) to celebrate Alex's leaving his old job and starting a cool design job. I told him I'd go but: 1. I'm flat broke. I have nothing. Nada. Nil. Zero. and 2. His friends from work are going to be there and Alex's boss is really annoying. Crazy little man. On Saturday I am supposed to leave at 5.30 AM from my place, sleepwalk to my aunt's place and then be in a car for four hours with my crazy aunts and cousins to go to Saratoga to my cousin's baby shower. Her husband is a crazy redneck. He has deer meats and shit on his fridge and he loves hunting, drinking, the whole nine yards. Also, the white people like to stare at me when I'm there BAAA. They're not familiar with such exotic beauty like mine MUWAHAHAHAHA. Anyways so Saturday is going to suck and I hope I overslept on Saturday with a hangover instead. But I have no money for beer. Okay we'll see how it goes. I'm outta here. Have a good fucking weekend! Peace.

      Back at the office. Ah I hate being predictable.  So this weekend was a pretty good one. One of the reasons is because I had sex, after a month and a half long dry spell. But we'll get to that later.  Let's see. On Friday I got home from work around 6-ish. I bummed around, did nothing. Then Elliot came by at at around 8-ish I think. Loren got home at 8.30ish. I took a shower, got ready, etc. and we left for Luke's party at around 10. We took cab, got there at 10.30ish and a bunch of ppl were already there, including Joe B. and Scott playing beer pong. The party was at Luke's backyard which was great because it was so nice out. I had mad allergies but after a couple of beers the pain went away. Yeah! It was pretty cool, probably around 30 ppl, and most of them I know from our parties. Even Stan and Denny was there. What was funny was that a bunch of ppl already knew about our upcoming costume party, and we hadn't even told that many ppl yet. They're all excited, which is great. I thought ppl were gonna be like all lame about it and not want to go but they're all excited. Denny's gonna go as Spiderman, Scott and Joe B. as Mario and Luigi, Anna as Bjork with the Swan thing, Alan as a monkey, Loren's coming as the nurse (Darryl Hannah) from Kill Bill, etc. etc. I should be a hell lot of fun.  Anyways, the party was kicking into full swing after an hour we got there. And I was trashed already. During the 3 or 4 hrs we were there I prob. drank about 8 beers and half a bottle of Bacardi, which at the end of the night I stole the bottle from Mo and was walkin around with it. Hmm, ladylike? Anyways at around 2-ish ppl started leaving, cuz most of them are whacked already, and I apparently convinced Loren that it was time to go home. Marco drove us home. We stopped at the Bagel store on the way. We got home, I passed out. lore and Marco ate their food, lore puked her brains out, marco passed out on the couch and there goes Friday.  Okay, so on Saturday we woke up late. we were supposed to go to Philly that day to see the Bouncing Souls and Hot Water Music. There were supposed to be 8 of us going but at about an hour before we were supposed to leave we found out that the show's sold out. Since the only ones that have advanced tickets are John, Gina, Alex, and Alan, so they went and the rest of us stayed in good ol NY. I was really looking forward to the cheesesteaks tho. Whatever.  So anyways Anna came over at around 4, chilled with me and Lore. And then at around 6.30 we left to Pratt to go to Anna's friend pigroast party. We were looking around the campus to find it but we couldn't find it. Then we found out that they moved it to some kid's apt. We got there, the pigs had been roasted, ambushed, and finished. We got there at around 8 and EVERYONE there was already wasted. There were three kegs going. So the reason why we went there was because Anna was invited by Marcello, this guy that she'd been on 3/4 dates with. We got to the party, trying to fidn marcello and of course we found him in the backyard doing a keg stand. he was beyond drunk. So we stayed at the party, stood pretty much the whole time by the keg, drank, talked to some drunk boys, gigled, etc etc. Elliot came by to join us later on. At this point Anna and Marcello was making out in a corner behind us, in the backyard. About an hour later, me, lore, and Anna went upstairs to pee and when we came back lord o mighty we found Marcello makin out with some chick at the same spot where he and Anna was makin out before. Anna was so upset and we left. We went to Williamsburg to go to this bar called M. got there early, around 11.30 and it was expectedly empty. So we ate chinese food instead. Around 1 in the morning we decided to just hail a cab and went home. We got home, Alex and Alan were there and we started smoking. Yeah. Pot is great. Anyways, we also watched Full Metal Jacket that night, which was awesome and insane and Kubrick-like and amazing, and also we saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation with Renee Zellweger and Matthew McCougnahey which sucked big time. I got so bored watching it that I was seriously considering to start eating one of my toes just to keep me awake. Anyways, everyone passed out around 4, elliot went home at 6 and I passed out.  Sunday, Mother's day. i didn't do shit all day. then at around 6 I took off to my aunt/godmom's house and hung out there. i got her a card and chocolate cake. I went homr at around 11 and alex, val, and anna was there. we hung out, watched this The Cure Trilogy dvd I stole from my aunt's and then we saw a bout three episodes of the Dave Chapelle show and passed out.  Woke up this morning and Max was sleeping on the couch. HUH? My life is so weird sometimes.  Anyways, the sex thing. I can't really say when or with who I had sex with, for reasons that if someone I know finds out, I will be cast out of society and be forced to live in like Jersey or something. But it happened this weekend, with someone I know pretty well, and it was damn good. I was a little drunk, and I think that was what started it but it was good and casual and all. The thing is, this guy is kind of had a history with one of my friends. Not best friend, not close friend, just a friend. I probably wouldn't have had sex with him if I was sober but hey I wasn't, and I was horny. Damn it. Whatever. Anyways it was cool and he was cool about it. It's our little secret. well Loren and Anna know (I told him that I was going to tell them) and they were cool about it. They think I shouldn't worry too much. So anyways that's that. Also, I'm a little pissed about the fact that this guy from LA that I had been talking to for a while was supposed to come to NY and didn't, and din't even bother telling me. What's up with that? Granted that we're not anything and I definitely don't want to be his girlfriend or anything remotely close to that but if you say you were going to be here, then fucking be here, or at least tell me about it. I changed my sheets for nothing. Well not entirely for nothing.. ;P.   Alright. I better go back to work. peace everyone!

      I am trying so hard right now not to fall asleep. My eyes feel heavy, my body is relaxed, and the chill air in my office, from our air conditioners is making me way sleepy. So anyways, as usual I am in the office right now. It has been alright. I didn't do shit as usual. I did some shit but nothing really mattered. This morning the photographer came with the images from the shoot last Friday. So me, and my two bosses went into our  war room  and had a meeting with him. He's not bad, some of the stuff actually looks pretty good. So the meeting lasted for a while, it was about noon when we’re done I think. After that I started doing some research for my articles. I wasn't planning on writing my stories today, but I just wanted to be a little prepared for next week.   Anyways today is big boss' birthday and we got him a card and a cake and that was pretty cool. We all sang happy birthday and then he cut the cake. We all got huge slices it was insane. I feel like puking ugh, I totally butchered the cake and now, ugh.  So there's about 45 minutes before I can go so I'm just trying to kill time. Let's see what last night was all about. I got home, chilled, and then I prepared myself for my whole Friends night. I know it's so corny, cheesy, etc., but I love the show. I know a lot of ppl thought that the show was just on for too long and that the latter half of the show is not even funny anymore. I don't necessarily disagree with that. I do think they show used to be a lot better but it’s still cute. Fuck sometimes I think I’m a TV junkie. Whatever. Anyways so Loren got home not too long after. She got an A for the painting she did of me. But anyways me and Loren watched the final episode of Friends together. It was one heck of an episode. It was really good. I mean everyone know that Ross and Rachel were going to end up together, but at least they made it interesting. So Matt le Blanc is doing a Friends spinoff called Joey. It's going to be on Thursday nights. I really really hope the show would do well, but I know it's just going to fucking suck ass.  Anyways, after the whole friends thing, Chris came home. At that point, we hadn't seen him in like 2 days. So he told us where he was. Basically he got a recording gig for some big advertising company. The company is making a war documentary and they wanted him to do the songs. Some of the songs were definitely modest mouse-ish, which is unexpected but very cool. So basically Chris stayed the whole day and night recording. I think that's pretty awesome, all he wants to do is to sing and make a living that way, and now that he's on the right track, that's pretty fucking awesome I think.  So after a while we watched Jay Leno. He had the whole Friends cast on his show that night. It was immensely, indescribable, stupendously BORING. Leno sucks. He totally has lost his edge. So fucking boring. Anyways after that we watched Conan and oh good Lord guess who was one of the guests? Fucking Brad Pitt! Oh man oh man. I know it’s so cliche to like Brad Pitt and sometimes I disgust myself for going gaga over him but yo, if you're a fucking woman/girl whatever, you're gonna fucking love Brad Pitt. Any woman/ girl who says they don't like Brad Pitt are fucking liars. I mean, he just oozes sex. It’s irresistible. So while me and Loren was watching him, half drooling half hyperventilating, Chris asked that if Brad Pitt would be naked on Playgirl, would we buy it? D'OH. I told him that if there was such thing I would blow the picture up to life size and tape it to my wall and hump it every fucking night. I probably wouldn't exactly do that. But I would definitely masturbate to it, I'd definitely get myself a copy, and get myself off haha. Anyways Conan was really good. I think he’s going crazier and crazier. He's just insane. That whole bit about his Ford Taurus? Unfuckingbelievable. And the Troy outfit? He actually stripped down to his boxers and put on the costume, on national television. CONAN ROCKS! He's awesome. He is the king of late night TV, fuck those old bastards like Leno and Letterman, and forget fucking alien cocksucker Carson Daly. Conan rocks! Anyways I went to bed after that.  So on the agenda tonight is me getting trashed. I want to get drunker than New Year's. And New year's was really, really, yes, really bad. I want to celebrate me getting a sponsorship with tons and tons of booze, and pot. YES. And luckily, there's a big party going on at Luke's tonight. It’s going to be one hell of a night. Hella cool. Eww forget I said hella, I sounded like an west coast loser. And on Saturday, I actually really want to see Kill Bill Vol. 2 so maybe we'd do that. Alright people of cyber land, have a good fucking weekend and pray that I won't get alcohol poisoning. Peace, and I'm out.

      One more hour till I can leave. I am so tired. I feel drained, in a good way though. I am in sucha  good mood it's insane. Very rare.  So bout two days ago my boss came to me and offered me the permanent associate editor position (I was only doing this temporary, under contract). I'm going to start June 1st, and a decent salary. Not bad for a "recent" "graduate". Anyways I didn't accept the offer right away, because I still had to tell her that I am here on a temporary visa, which will expire in October, and that if she wants me to workt here permanently, she's going to have to sponsor mefor a work permit. See this has been bothering me for a while. Even though I know I kick major fucking ass at work (when I'm not blogging of course), I do everything right and fast, but things liek the sponsorship is tricky. Some people just don't do that. But anyways yesterday I went to talk to her and stuff, my voice is cracky and I was kinda shaking too. Bad bad. But I told her, and basically she told me not to worry and that the company will sponsor me. THANK GOD. I've been worrying for a year now, thinking about what the fuck I was going to do with my life if I have to go home in October. But now I have a pretty good chance of staying, plus I have an awesome job with pretty decent money. Things are definitely looking up. Thank you Robert Smith! (Don't ask.)   Anyways yesterday after work I chilled at home, watch some stupid tv, then Alan came home and told Alan everything. He gave me hugs and stuff and we just talked. Then I took a mini-nap (only half an hour) and then Loren came home. We chilled for a bit then I stripped down and put on my Japanese kimono. SO then I posed in my room, against the wall, with my hair down, my kimono half open, tons of leg, a cigarette and bam, loren started painting me. She was using watercolor, and the painting is her final project for one of her art classes. The paper was huge, I was a little bigger than half size. It was super cool. She painted me for about two hours and it came out really, really nice. I kinda look like a sad, sexy japanese whore haha. I figured the girl in the painting was just sitting down taking a breather (her eyes closed, having a stog) from her full day of fucking old freaky Japanese businessmen. ew. Anyways it was really cool. We're going to hang it in the living room. For a split second I thought about putting it up in my room, but how fucking narcisistic would that be? Hehe. Also I don't even look at the girl in the painting as me. Just as that girl, with a little me-quality in her. Once somebody gives me a digital camera I will put it up here. Damn I hate the fact that my birthday is in january. It's like over the minute the year changes. Fuck.  Anyways I'm really tired now and I really should go back to work. But in the past three days I've just been sitting here doing absolutely nothing. Checking out other ppl's blogs, friendster pages, clothes, funny e-zines, etc. That reminds me, I should erase my cookies today. Hmm. I don't think I'm that paranoid. Peace.

      Man.. I haven't updated this blog for over a week. I've just been kind of lazy. The rest of last week went by fast, and the weekend sneaked up on me and before I know it it was over. On Friday a bunch of us went to Smith's. Me, Lore, Al, Alx, S-man, V, Anna, Lk, All, Dima, and Elliot. Yeah, did I mention that Dima's back for a couple of weeks. he's been here for about a week. His dad has cancer and they found out way too late and the doctor is saying that he only has two months to live. I feel really horrible. I can't imagine how Dima must be feeling, but we had a long talk sometime last week. I think he made peace with it and now he's just trying to be there during his dad's last months. God. How morbid. He's strong though, and I really hope he can get through this.  Anyways, so on friday we didn't stay at Smith's for that long. We went back to the house at around 2.30. loren was trashed at this point, everyone else was just kind of tipsy. me and E started doing some lines, as usual. And then all of us just went up to the roof, Chris brought his guitar, and we just jammed out there. It was really cool. I stayed up till around 9, then I passed out. Saturday night we were planning to go to this bar round the hood, they had free Yagermeister shots all night and they wren't ID-ing. But then Scott called and told us that because so many ppl showed up they started ID-ing. Thing is, Loren and Anna's only 20 and they don't have any fake IDs so we couldn't go. Loren was pissy the whole time too. Well, what the fuck are we gonna do? I mean, sometimes Lore gets so pissy when we can't go to a place because she doesn't have a fake ID. I mean wtf? Get one! Jeez, it's not that hard. Also, she gets pissy when i want to go somewhere and she can't come with me. Ugh.. whatever. She'll turn 21 in December so I'll just stay cool until then. Anyways that night we ended up going to Arachne and chilled for a bit. At some point of the night me and Al ran across the street to a bar and sneaked a tequila shot, and then we went back to Arachne hehe. That was kinda fun. Oh one more thing. Our waiter at Arachne turns out to be one fo Stan's friends and he'd been to almost all of our parties. he's been at our place so many times but because all of us are always TRASHED during the parties, we didn't remember him. he was like, none of you guys remember me? I've been to your place a bunch of times! hehehe. Anyways we then grabbed some beers and went back to the apt. We played drinking UNO, got way trashed. Alex came by at around 3-ish and then we smoked a jay. At around 5ish Anna started puking and I just passed out. And on Sunday I basically just chilled all day.  Oh god. I completely forgot about Tuesday. What a mess. last Tuesday, after work me and elliot met up and then we went to pratt to check out Anna's paintings. Gina was there and Loren joined us later on. We hung out at pratt for a while. They ahve sculptures and art all overt the campus it was really fucking cool/. there was this huge rubber tire couch int he middle of a lawn. awesome. And then Anna showed us her paintings. it was really, really cool. she paints abstract on this huge canvases, one was about 5x6 feet. Crazy. I can't really explain it but her stuff is really, really great. I think she's so talented. I had a feeling that Loren felt really intimidated after seeing Anna's stuff. But Anna's been painting her whole life and Lore just started really seriously painting not even a year ago.  Anyways Gina gave us a ride home and me, E, and Lore got home at around 9. E brought adderall and we started doing that. i think alex, dima, luke, val, and seyhod came over and we chilled. at around 3/4 people started leaving. Alan passed out around 4 I think and loren around 6.30. me and E just kept on doing A. And then at around 7.30 I told him that I had to start getting ready for work. After some light persuation I ended up calling out, and chilled at home all day. we kept doing the A until around 3/4 pm, sumthin like that. not sleeping and just talked all night. it was really, really cool. I learned so much about elliot that night compared to the whole year Ive known him. So basically we were fucked up for about 18 hours. god.   So anyways, yesterday at around 8/9 pm, me, Lore, and Al were just sitting in our living room, talking about stuff when I kinda decided to cut down for a bit. Since the Purchase weekend three weeks ago I've been getting fucked up every single night, either drinking, smoking, or doing shit. I feel burnt out, my body's way tired, my throat hurts, and my nose is way fucked up. I think I'm going to chill it for a bit. I'm getting bored with all that stuff anyways.  Oh, we're throwing another party on may 28th. It's an end-of-school/val's bday/hello summer costume party! i'm torn between dressing up as lucy liu's character in kill bill (with the white geisha outfit), or uma thurman from pulp-fiction (and do coke all night haha), or alex from clockwork orange. Or maybe a big penis. hhehe. We'll see.  Alright I have to get back to work now. peace out cupscout.

      started my old obsession with postal service again... thanks to alex burning me a copy...im a cheap bastard.  it's almost seven in the morning right now. i haven't slept. god damn it. im starting to build a sunday habit. i swear i have no self control whatsoever. i'm going to go to work soon. might be a good thing to go early. if i wait around i might just pass out right here, sitting in front my computer.  so the weekend. ugh.  friday. went to sophies. got somewhat drunk. saturday. went to coney island. i rode the cyclone for the first time. insane. rejuvenating experience i have to say. kinda like a near death exp. went home, ppl came over. chilled on the roof. sunday. cooked salmon carbonara. yummy. hung out. went to wicked monk to see never say die, joe brady's band. good show. tons of ppl came over to the place. got drunk. still drunk i think. blergh. was really fun though, joe brady and his friends played some songs. made out for a little bit with james, joe brady's older brother. kinda silly huh. whatever. totally blamed it on drinks.  the thing with moe is done now. we tried to hang out this weekend but just couldnt. she couldn't hang on friday, and worked the rest. i hung out with my friends, and didn't really feel forcing it and trekking to the city (even though its not much of a trek really). she moved to purchase today, she's staying there, teaching for a month, and then she'll leave to europe, where she'll stay for six months, or more. i guess it was a good experience. i'm glad that i met her. she was really cool and i do like her a lot. kinda opened up my eyes a little bit. i guess it's just bad timing, which is fine. i'm not really looking for anything.  on friday i didn't go to work. i woke up way late, at 2, and everyone at work had left so i couldn't even call anyone. i definitely fucked up there and will probably, well most definitely get bitched at today. fucking great. i need to reasses (im sure i spelled that wrong) my fucking lifestyle. i need to start acting like an adult. being one. i need to let go of certain things. i just dont want to do it yet. it sucks. i feel like shit.

      Blergh. I hate being at work. But what else is new right? So I finally got some decent sleep last night. I passed out around 3.30 and I woke up mad late at 9, that's almost six hours of sleep. Good. V. good.  Alright so on Monday I was supposed to hang out with Mo and we got to the bar late and I talked to her and she couldn't make it. Cuz she's still stuck is Williamsburg picking up her moped and shit. But a lot of her friends were at the bar and so we chilled. The bartender, Mor, is mad cool. She's a tattoo artist, kinda trying to get the word out and stuff and she's offering tattoos for 60 bucks. Insane! Now I just might have go get another one, for that kinda price, I'll get tattoos all over my face. Anyways so I was a little upset, didn't get to see her and stuff but the jack and coke made it all better.  So anyways I talked to her and we hung out last night. I met her at Virgin in Union Square. She was looking mad fucking tired. This girl is crazy, she has like 3 jobs, no sleep, and party hard. Crazy. She looks cute though, as usual. Anyways we were gonna see the Bukowski documentary but it was too late. So we had a bite at Dojo's, we both got the soy burger dinner, which was cool, and after that we went to the Sunshine and saw Coffee and Cigarettes. The movie was pretty good. The middle part of it is kinda weak but it got better towards the end. V. original though and the shots were in black and white but it was so fucking great.  After the movie we went to this bar Max's not far from there. Two of her friends were there, this kid Jon, and Rob. We hung out, had a couple of drinks, and we took off around 2. Okay so the verdict of the night, well I don't know. I had a lot fun and she was really talkative which was cool, cuz she doesn't talk a lot. I felt a little awkward at first hanging out together but she was really cool, she kept talking to fill in the awkward silences and that's good. I got to know her a lot better and she was asking questions about me and stuff which was cool. The only thing is, I can't tell if she likes me like that or not. Since all her friends told me that she's mad shy and I have to be the aggresive one, I wasn't expecting her to make any moves or anything like that. And I do just want to kiss her and shit but I'm such a fucking pussy. I'm not confident enough that she likes me that I would just go and make a move. What my friends told me is that the fact that we hung out just me and her, and that she kept inviting me to hang out with her friends and stuff means she likes me. Cuz from the get go she knows that I like her, I mean I hit on her so she knows. And if she doesn't like me back then we wouldn't be hanging out. See that would make sense. She's just so fucking shy and hard to read that I don't know what to do. Ugh. This is ridiculous. I just want to fucking have fun and I like her a lot and stuff but like I've said before, it's crazy that I have to be the man in this "relationship". Arrrrrggghhhh. i'm a girl. A girl. A girl. Not a guy. I just like this girl a lot. Man this is weird. Alright I better do some work. peace.

      Urgh. Weird ass weekend. It went by so fast.  Friday After work I went home. Was gonna hangout with this chick I met the weekend before. I ended up not going. Her name is Mohanee. She asked me if I wanted to go dancing with her on Saturday. Anyways, in the end Me, Lore, Alex, Neal, and Elliot went to Sophie's. Got trashed. Was really fun. The bartender kept giving me free drinks.  I think he has an asian fetish that old man. But it's cool. Free shit is always good. We got home at around 4. I sat on the couch and passed out. Apparently some other people came by and shit but I have no clue. Elliot carried me to my room but somehow I woke up in the living room. Huh?  Saturday Didn't do shit today. I woke up with the worst hangover. All I did all day was sleeping and eating. At around 9 something Mo called and told me about the plan of the night. She and a couple of her friends are going to this bar/club thing called the Apartment. It's a trendy hot spot in the Meatpacking district. Not really my kinda scene but whatever. Around 10-ish Anna, Elliot, Alex, and Val came over. And then Loren and Neal. We got some coke and I did a couple of lines and then around 1 am me and Lore left. We got there, the place is packed and we went straight to the basement. Mo was there with this three guys, her close friends, and some other friends. I felt a little uncomfortable hanging out with all those kids just because I don't really know them and I don't know what the fuck they're thinking. Probably that I'm some strange little chick trying to get with their friend. Anyways the night ended up really cool. We were dancing, hangin out, talking, etc. After the club we went to Yaffa's, this cool little joint in the East Village. I got home at around 5.30 I think. Alright, so I didn't kiss her or anything like that, but I wanted to. I think. It was weird because all her friends were there. Me and her went outside and talk for a little bit which was cool. The only sucky thing is that, see I'm not really a shy person but I am mad shy when it comes to flirting with chicks. I never liked a girl before and I don't really know how to do that. I do like her a lot though, especially after last night. I think she's cool, and def. hot. She has this gorgeous face that to be honest, kinda intimidates me. But anyways throughout the night her friends kept giving me pointers and shit about her. After hanging out the whole night, I found out that this girl is really, really, extremely shy about this shit. Worse than me. She's 25, she doesn't really live anywhere, she's kinda just hang around doing her thing. she graduated from Purchase, which is insane. And she was there for vulture cock, when i was there. craazy. in about two/three weeks she's going to europe for three months. which kinda sucks. this whole situation is crazy. anyways yeah she's mad shy. What Lore told me was that she was talking with her friends and stuff and they told her that she's not really experience with girls and stuff and that she's still confused (meaning bi) and stuff. She doesn't really like men (haha) but she's just really shy and doesn't really know what to do when it comes to girls. So if anything, I have to be the aggresive one. Fuck. That sucks. I really don't know what the fuck I'm doing here you know. But anyways they told Lore that they think she's into me. They said that the fact that she came outside with me and talked to me and stuff means a lot, cuz she's really shy. I do get a vibe from her tho, that she's into me and stuff. I could see that she was making an effort to flirt with me, even though its really hard for her. oh god. this is crazy. the one time that i'm into a chick i have to be the aggresive one. wtf? why can't i like some full on dyke that knows wtf she's doing. both me and her are not like that. i guess i could be a little more aggresive but one i have to know her better first and two i have to kinda be sure that she's definitely into me. otherwise it's pointless. well i guess we'll see. mo and her friends invited me to go hang out with them on monday, to this bar in the e.vill where they hang every monday. so i'm gonna go with them. we'll see how that turns out. i decided that i like her though, after last night. and i just want to kiss her and see how that is. blerrgh. anyways im gonna go. i'm so fucking tired. it's father's day and i dont have shit to do. all my friends are hanging out with their parents and i wish i can do that. i talked to my mom last night, which was nice. my dad got this cool new job and im v. excited for him. things seems to be getting better. alright im gonna go. happy father's day everyone. peace.

      I don't feel like talking. It's the weekend. So, let me proudly introduce: a group of lazy ass-, broke ass-, stupid ass-people that I call my friends, and well myself included.  It was a lovely day. The sky was so beautiful.      My friends were hanging out at Prospect Park while I was slaving away at work. Meet Anna, she's so gorgeous. She is one of my best friends. Anna used to date Kevin. Kevin is Alex's bestfriend.      This is Alex. He's a sweetheart that likes to think he's not. (Sorry I'm too lazy to angle it right, I will) Alex went to high school with Alan.       And this is Alan, my good friend and crazy and sometimes annoying roomate. But I love him. Alan loves monkeys.       It's getting a little dark. Let's go into my apartment. (Man I'm gay) That's Val and Elliot. What's up guys? Elliot used to be Alan's roomate in Purchase U. Val's Seyhod's girlfriend.      This is Seyhod. Seyhod and Alex used to work at Rite Aid together, and they used to live so close. What are you doing there Seyhod?      Ugh it's gettin hot in the apartment. Let's go to the roof! Look, Alan and Neal are already there. Meet Neal. Neal's Elliot's best friend. They've known each other for a while. Neal also went to Purchase. Neal and Alan are a little drunk.      Alright I want to be in the picture. Meet me,a little drunk, and meet Loren, gorgeous girl that's my roomate and best friend. She looks kinda silly in her hoodie.      Ugh it's getting late. Look at the lights on the street.      It's making me feel crazy.      Yeah, that's enough. peace out!      have a good weekend and peace out!

      Okay so I’ve been feeling especially crappy today, Not feelings wise, but physically. (Warning: Girl Stuff! Girl Stuff!) I got my period not too long ago, seriously only about five minutes late. Five minutes I’m not shitting you. I’m so regular it’s terrifying. I must have been destined to be a baby machine! Ack! Anyways, usually my period is light and quick, like a wax minus the pain. Actually not like a wax at all. Anyways today’s the fourth day and I’m still fucking bloated. My stomach’s mad crampy all day, and for whatever reason, I’m hungry all the time. What the fuck? I’m usually only hungry BEFORE the period, not during. Christ. Also I think I might have masturbated on my sleep last night cuz my fucking vag feels sore (and not the soreness you get when you’re bleeding to death, I mean having your period). What the hell? (End of Girl Stuff)  So last night after working like a dog I went to my aunt’s house. She got pics from the wedding and I look drunk in all of them. Except for the one picture of me in the church. Obviously. Anyways I chilled there for a while, watched cable with happy tears running down my face. Oh how I miss you worthless pointless channel sixty something and up. I saw:  - About forty seconds of The Next Action Star, or sumthin like that. My aunt was watching it and once my eyes focused and big bulging muscly women crying and trashing each other, I grabbed the remote and moved on to… - The first five minutes of Summerland. Absolutely pathetic. There was a little manchild surfing and got wiped out. He passed out, woke up realizing he got OH MY GOD tiny puny scrapes on his knee/feet/brain whatever. So this blond lolitawhore child came over and started talking to him. He, who was giving full undivided attention to his knee before was disrupted and looked up. The sun was shining, and dramatically the camera shows whatsherface face glimmering under the sun, mad close up. Her nostrils were too close to my tv viewing area for comfort. Gross. Anyways she supposedly help him blab la and on the first five minutes of meeting man-child she actually told him don’t judge me because I’m rich. After that I couldn’t really hear or see what was going on because I successfully stabbed myself in the eyes and then the ears. - After a speedy recovery (I always wanted to say that) I switched to MTV Real World San Diego which caught my attention for a while because one of the guys, I think his name is Randy, was kind of hot but then I realized they were all gay. - And then lord-o-mighty I happened to stumble into TBS and guess what was on: (enter heavenly angels singing) Sex and the City! I forgot that they have the show there now. Except for the fact that all the dirty words were taken out and replace by a creepy so noticeable voice over, it was fucking great. It was two episodes back to back too. Great!  Anyways after that I called cab and went home. I got home, mad bored and lonely (I always get lonely when I hang out at my aunt’s), and guess who were there? A bunch of my friends, yeay! Seyhod, Val, Alex, and Elliott were there. Unfortunately being losers that they are, they all went to Coney Island without me and rode the Cyclones three times in a row. WAAaaaaa. But whatever. Anyways they all left early, prob. around 1 I think. Me and Lore hung out for a while and then I went to bed at around 3.   Also, Anna got into a HUGE fight with her parents and she moved out. She is currently staying with us until she can find/afford a place, which is totally cool. I feel really bad for her, her parents are really abusive. Her dad actually hit her yesterday, so fucking messed up. So I’m very glad that she’s staying with us instead of in that kind of environment and me and Lore and everyone else, we’re gonna try to make her feel comfortable.   Alright I have to go. Somethin fishy is happening at work. Piece.

      I have been defeated. I no longer exist. I'm dead. Dead. One with the ground. There are no energy, no feelings, no pain nor hunger. I am dead.  Yeah so I got bitched at today at work for coming in late, which totally reasonable since evilchinadoll-time does start about an hour and a half after real time. but it still sucks. i have to start coming in at 9 every day. fuuuuuuuuuuccck. there goes my little rebel act against the 9-5 thing. i have no choice to surrender now, for i am a slave of money and being fired would mean going back to the streets of nevada again. hmm.  Work is going absolutely fucking insane. since i had been so fucking lazy in the last couple of weeks, now everything is catching up to me. i am doing a million things at once. i'm numb. i'm ningly. i'm dead. i did, however, finished the one big article i was assigned to. oh wait i assigned myself the story, great. but i finished it, and now i am left with two more shit to do and im already exhausted. i went to be at around 4.30 last night and i woke up at 9, mad mad late. got to work at 10.30 because even though i know im running late, i still need to sit down on the couch smoking mad cigarettes while staring at the coffee table. and then im late.   so anyways i met this chick last weekend. thats right ladies and gentlemen, a chick. i'm totally straight, but might be a little bi-curious, or might be just a drunk. anyways i was at this bar in the city with neal and lore where this hot little dyke walks in. keep in mind i have never been attracted to a chick before. anyways she dresses mad dyke-ish but she was so fucking hot. anyways eventually i got drunker and long story short i actually hit on her and got her number. after thinking long and hard, and being poked with monster forks by lore, i called her last night. i was mad embarassed it's ridiculous. that's probably what guys feel all the time when they had to call a girl. oh wait guys don't feel, what am i talking about, they're completely emotionless. anyways i called her and i was mad nervous and i asked her out (i think). so she told me she's going to a party on friday and she invited me. and she said i can bring a friend, cuz it's her close friends party. so that's gonna be fun. ima bring loren and see what the whole dealio is. i'm sure i'm straight, and probably it was just the alcohol but we'll see. she's mad hot.  alright time to get back to work. fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckkkkk. work sucks. esp. today. i did learn a bunch of lessons though:  -it's not okay to make up your own time zone, especially when it's way behind your boss' and coworkers' -it's okay to lie and cry a little bit in front of your boss to get some sympathy because it will prevent you from looking like a total lazy ass why-the-fuck-did-i-hire-her kinda employee -it's okay to get a little drunk at an office party because everyone gets to see your fun side and love you for it -it's not okay to drunkenly made lunch meetings with prospective clients during the party and completely forgot  them -it's okay to not like your superior esp. since he talks a lot of bullshit and he kind of looks like a mouse covered in jiz, nasty sleazeball -it's definitely okay to make said comments about a superior because if he looks at your boobs while talking to you then he doesn't deserve anything but insults, gross ass cocksucker  peace.

      So last night was the launch event for the magazine I work for. It was so much fun. About 500 people were. The food was good, the music was awesome, the free drinks were, well, fucking great. And also personally it just felt really good because we've been working hard for a while now and finally last night it was kind of like releasing the mag into the world haha, kinda like birth. I'm relieved, but also scared as hell. I hope things go well. I don't want to be out of a job you know. So anyways Loren, Alan, and Elliott came to the launch. That was great. It felt really good having my friends around, among all thise supposedly professional prospective clients/ customers. Blah blah blah. I got a little tipsy at first, but at the end of the night I think I was durnk. I'm not sure. Maybe a little drunk. I remember walking out from the place, my feet were in so much pain. I took off my shoes and Alan carried me to the train I think. Or maybe Elliott? Wait I think it's Alan. Argggh. Did we take the train? Whatever, I don't know. Then we went to Park Slope, had chicken at kennedy's, then we went to Bar Reis, played pool and ended up at Smitty's. It was a good night.  And now it's Friday, and I am just completely drained. I am so exhausted and just so fucking glad that it's fucking Friday. I've been running on empty this past week. I think in the past 4 nights I slept a total amount of maybe 9/10 hours at the most. Tonight me and Lore are just going to have a quiet night at the house. i don't know how feasible that is though, since ppl always come over to our place in the weekends. What i really want to do is just go home, take a long ass nap, wake up, rent a movie, make some screwdrivers (since I still had that bottle of Absolut from the wedding), and veg out on the couch with Loren. Man. That would be awesome. What would probably, well most definitely going to happen is that I would go home, not take a nap, maybe take a quick shower, watch a little TV, then a million people would come over, drink beer, smoke some pot, and then pass out. Ugh. I miss going to sleep. I've been passing out more often than actually going to bed.   Oh i just remember soemthing. i got to work this morning and one of my coworkers told me that last night, some blonde girl he doesn't know came up to him and pointed at me and said hey that asian girl is so sexy. wtf? what the hell is that? so weird. I wish i know who said it. that'd be funny. maybe if she's hot we could do a little sumthin sumthin ya know what i mean hehehhee j/k. (Btw, I hate being referred as the Asian Girl. wtf? I never point out people like that, a chick is a chick, a guy is a guy, not a white chick, or a white guy. unless you're actually describing someone, race is not necessary.)  Also what's weird is the fact that I have no money. I have just enough to pay rent, and bills, and then I'm left with probably, 30/40 bucks for the week. How the hell did THAT happened? I need to budget more.  Alright I'm about to pass out. I'm gonna take off early today. Have a good weekend everyone. This is evilchinadoll signing out. Peace!

      Blergh. Tired. Blerh.  I had two hours of sleep last night. I don't even know what I'm doing here. Bleerrrrggghh. I'm putting the total blame on Alan and Elliot for forcing (yeah right) me to smoke, watch Aquateen, watch Ab-Fab and chill until 6 AM. So anyways last night was a lot of fun, despite the consequences I am facing today. After I got home from work, Elliot came by and me, him, and Alan chilled for a little bit, watchign a couple episodes of Ab-Fab, which Elliot brought. Elliot also brought his fancy little new Sony digital camera. That shit fucking rocks. He got is for his bday from his parents. I'm so jealous. Shit's great, it has a huge screen, very small and v.light, hold tons of storage. The only sucky thing is that compared to other brands Sony charges more for batteries and stuff and also if you don't want to buy extra batteries, you need a special travel charger i think and that's more too. Also, the flash is right next to the lens, which is retarded so you almost always get red-eyes. However, it's still pretty awesome. Just the fact that it's so tiny and pratical is great. I'm thinking about getting one but I'm not sure. I'm already in love witht he Canon PowerShot one I've been eyeing for the past couple of months. We'll see. Anyways we took the bus to Coney Island. We played ski-ball, and accumulated just enough tickets to get a whoopi-cushion, which unfortunaly has a little hole on it as it didn't work so well. We also played the Eldorado bumper cars about 5/6 times in a row and that was mad fun. I always have such loving feelings about Coney Island. I feel such strong personality and ol-skool sense of community there it's great, and if you go with good friends it's even fucking better. Anyways after that we went back to the place, hung out with Lore and Alex and smoked ourselves stupid. We saw a bumch of episodes of AbFab and Aquateen. It was fun though last night, it actually felt like a productive high, if there's such thing.   -Me and Alan got into a lengthy conversation about revolutions, political and stuff and basically after talking about it for two hours we figured out a bunch of stuff, esp, about cultural revolution. I can't get into it right now cuz it'll be long and i prob. won't remember everything since I was so wasted last night. But I shall remember. -Me and Elliot (and maybe Loren if she doesn't flake out) agreed to start a little reading group. I never had one before so it's going to be cool. I have always wanted to join a book group but the one out there is so impersonal and most of the readers are house-wives. I want ppl who'd read the same books with me, and then we can all chill, smoke a blunt and talk about it. Anyways so we're going to start with Fast Food Nation. I'm going to buy it today, then catch up to where elliot is and talk about it soon. While I'm doing that Elliot will catch up on the Sedaris book that I'm reading and then we'll discuss together. I don't know how much you can discuss from Sedaris though since I'm totally biased. He's so great. -Also, Elliot is making me a website. It should be cool. I do want a cool-ass site where I can put my blog, maybe my stupid little stories, my pictures, and stuff so that should be real cool. I just hope it won't be a burden/hassle to Elliot. But if it's fun for him too then it's cool. BUT if I do get this website thing going, I might move back to LiveJournal. I'm not sure about it yet but it's a possibility. I might not do it. i'm so comfortable here. We'll see.  That's pretty much it. But it's gonna be cool. And also I just realized that there are no bookstores (christian bookstores don't count) either by my house, or by my office. STUPID. I gotta fucking go downtown everytime I need a fucking book. Ridiculous.  Anyways I was going to say something profound and mindblowing but I totally forgot cuz now my head's preoccupied with books I want to buy. Damn ADD. Peace!

      Uh-hum: Here's a little short story I wrote today cuz I was bored. Please be kind with the spelling and grammatical mistakes, shit was done in an hour, and not edited.   I am walking alone. It's misting and my face is damp. The streets are crowded. A middle aged woman sitting down on a park bench. A group of Goth teenagers smoking a cigarette by the entrance to the subway station. 14th street. Union Square.   I woke up late today. Took a shower. Hot shower. It's almost summer, but I love hot showers. The boiling water burning my skin, burning my face. My face is hot. I'm up. I thought about the dream I had last night. I'm almost sure it was a dream. I saw my mother in the dark. She was sitting on a big cushy chair, in the middle of a big, gaping, black space. There were no walls, yet it felt restrictive. There were no furniture, yet it felt stuffy. There were no sounds, yet my ears were buzzing. She was sitting in the dark. A cigarette burning, her hand limp, hanging down on one side of the chair. The ashes fell from the cigarette, but didn't reach the floor. Was there a floor? My mother could possibly have been floating on that chair. On her other hand was a glass of red wine. It was half empty. Or was it half full? Her wedding ring clinking against the glass. The sound it made shattered my ear drums.  It started out soft and short, tiny clinking noises. Clink. Clink. Clink.  My mother was staring at me from her chair. She was looking at me with this odd expression I couldn't comprehend. Clink. Clink. Clink. Was she angry? Clink. Clink. Clink. Was she sad? Clink. Clink. Her cigarette fell from her hand. There were no floor. It was still lit. The light from the cherry lit up the black gaping space surrounding it. Clink. Clink. Clink. My mother was gone. Clink. Clink. The cigarette kept falling. My ears hurt. Clink. Clink. Clink.  Clink. Clink.  The mist is gone. It's raining now. I have been walking for hours. The sun is gone. I'm cold. The tips of my ears are frozen and I can barely hold my cigarette in my hand. The streets are still crowded. People bumping into me, l feel suffocated. The smell of fish stings my nose. I hear the rustling of plastic bags, harmonizing with a language I don't understand. Mott street. Chinatown.  I ran out of hot water. The split second where the water turned cold was painful. I felt my skin crawling away from shock. My body tingled, like a train of ants marching all over. The steam I collected was gone. But I coudn't get the image of my mother out of my head. I wondered what she was doing, if she was sleeping, if she was cooking, if she was yelling at my siblings. I considered calling her, but then I realized that it was late over there. I didn't really want to talk to her anyway. I was in a weird mood, a weird place. She wouldn't understand it. Actually she probably would. My mother knows me too well.   I was fifteen. I just got home from school. I went straight to my room. I laid down on my maroon bed, staring at the scratches on the wallpaper. I was thinking about the night before. How it felt like a long time ago. How suddenly I felt old. It was late. Probably around 11. I was hanging out at my brother's room. We were watching a video together, and he had fallen asleep. I had a grape Fanta stain on my white school shirt. The air conditioner was going on full blast. I could't hear anything outside the room. All I heard was the humming. And it was cold, boy was it cold. I loved the cold. It was always so hot in our house. But my brother's room was arctic cold. I would sleep there with him, under the covers, with pillows lined up separating us, wearing thick flannel pajamas. But that night was different. I heard a knock on the door. I didn't even had the chance to say anything when our housekeeper ran in. I saw the frantic look on her face and panic swirled around the room, filling the cold air with a chill of uneasiness. I ran out to follow her. We went to our front gate, where a woman was standing there screaming something. Pretty, I thought. She was probably in her early twenties, tall, with a nice curvy body. She had jet black hair, cut into a bob, and she was wearing tight jeans and a white crop top, exposing her tanned, toned navel. She was screaming my father's name. She wanted to get into the house. My father wasn't there, neither was my mother. She screamed and screamed, but then she saw me and stopped. Her face broke into a smile, a smile that even now almost ten years later can still send chills through my spine. I hated the smile. I hated it. It was a slow, easy smile. But I knew what it was saying. Pity. Pity. She pitied me. Me. She started talking to me, about how my father always talked about me, his precious little girl. I felt like I've just been punched in the stomach and stripped naked. Sick, scared, and exposed. Who was this woman? She told me that if my father wasn't going to come out, he would have to pay for what he'd done to her. A mistake, a mistake I thought. My father coudn't have made anyone this angry. There was no way I was going to let her talked about my father that way. I started talking back to her. Spitting out words that has never came out of my mouth, rapidly like bullets. I wanted to hurt her. I didn't know her, but she deserved it.  A short time later my parents came home. They sent me to my room and I sat there on the floor, my ears pressed against the door. What the fuck was going on? How could they have her sitting on our living room, giving her water, tea, whatever the fuck it was. An hour went by and I was exhausted. I have accumulated a number of muffled words I heard through the door. Words that didn't make sense then as much as they do now. Lies. Heartbreak. Relationship. Hotels. Lies. Affair. Lies Lies. Abortion. That night, my life fell apart. I have no longer felt anything. Everything was a dream. Everything coudn't have been real. Everything was transparent. There were no feel, no taste, no smell. There was nothing. That night, that woman wanted something. She wanted money. She got it.  We've never seen her again since. But I wish money was the only thing she took from us.  It had stopped raining. My legs are tired from walking, yet I didn't want to sit down. The night air is crisp and clean, it felt fresh. The streets are now a little empty, only random people walking by now and then. The garbage truck is going down the block. The noise it makes pierces the quiet night, like a trumpet blaring in the middle of a soft jazz song. 73rd Street. Brooklyn. I'm a couple blocks away from my house.  What followed after that night was years or struggle and pain. My father morphed into this stranger, a man we didn't know who was living in our house, eating our food and using our water. My mother cried a lot. She would come to me with her face wet, with her glass of wine, with her red Dunhill cigarettes, and she would sat down on my bed. Sometimes she would lay on the bed next to me. We would get under the covers together and cuddled. After that, she would start talking. She would talk, and talk, and talk, like a train going through a never-ending trip, with a steady pace she would tell me happy stories. About herself, about my father, about us, among a million other topics. I would lay there next to her, clinging to her every word, while staring at the scratches on my wallpaper. Her stories were a drug, for those one or two hours we spent together everyday, everything would be alright. Everything was normal. There were no pain. Just happy memories.  I'm sitting on my couch. Staring at the phone. It's a little hot in the apartment. My roomates aren't home. My couch is hunter green, with white and beige flowers. I get up, take a thin blanket and a pillow from my room. I'm laying down on the couch, the air conditioner on full blast, and I closed my eyes.

      Monday. Blerrgh. Quick weekend recap:  Friday: Met up with Lore after work, ate at Arirang, had hibachi. Fucking A it was so great. It was funny though.Arirang's a Japanese restaurant and all the ppl working there had kimonos and shit and the chefs are "japanese". But when I got there I overheard them speaking in Indonesian and I flipped out. Crazy. I started talking to them.  Turned out that about 90% of the ppl working there were Indonesians. WTF? Crazy. It was fun though I bloew their cover MWAHAHAHAHA. The customers thought they were speaking Japanese while I know they're speaking my language MWAHAHAHHA. Stupid americans. Night started out way sketchy. Our "friend" didn't come with the "stuff" we ordered. Everyone got way bummed out. At around 2/3 AM, they all left but Elliot and Neal. So, me, Lore, Neal, Elliot, and Alan went on a beer run and drank till around 8 in the morning. We hung out on the roof and it was awesome. I got trashed, so did everyone else. Neal and Elliot crashed. (PS: Interesting fact of the night, Elliot kissed me. Was totally unexpected. Was drunk and nice, but weird. Out of the blue.)  Saturday: Woke up mad, mad hungover. Elliot took of in the morning. Neal stayed. Me, Al, Lore, and Neal went to Hinch's, had good ass breakfast. Walked to McDonalds, successfully resisted puking urges when walked through McD doors. Recovered and ate a chocolate sundae. Yumm. Got on Al's car, drove Neal home. Did a quick stop at my aunt's. My cousin from Saratoga was there and shitfuck she was HUGE. She's eight months pregnant. Damn. Anyways. Went home. Took a nap. Woke up, went to Century, found this cute CK underwear set for 20 bucks. so pretty. Was gonna get it but then waited in line for half an hour and lost total interest in item and whole faith of bargain stores and idiotic slow ass cocksucking retards in disquise of cashiers. Took off, went to Casa Calamari and had dinner. I had linguini with clam sauce. Yumm. our waiter look like Ricky Martin, pre-LaVidaLoca era tho. He had the stupid hair with the stupid body and the stupid smile. Grossss. After that, went home, decided not to go to the party in the Bronx in worry of getting trashed and then taking the train all the way to Brooklyn and get mugged. So, Alan, Alex, and Elliot went to the party while me, Lore, and Neal went to the city. We went to the Angelika, saw Supersize Me. Was pretty good. Great research, awesome topic, but bit boring at times. After that we went to Sophie's, drank a little, went back to Brooklyn, passed out.  Sunday: Woke up, slight hungover. Lounged around the couch with loren. Started getting ready for wedding. I had on a tight black pencil skirt, knee length with a list on the left thigh, a black tube tob, and my black pumps aka secret killing machine. Went to the church, were totally late. Caught last ten minutes of ceremony. Went back to my aunt's house, ate, smoke stogs, watched this stupid TV show called Single In The Hamptons. Oh my fuckin God. I want to shoot all those ppl, ugly, pathetic, incestious, scum lover rich bastards. Fuck you Hamptonians! You can't be happy/decent even if you wanted to. Anyways, then I changed into my dress for the reception. I had one the dress my aunt made for me (she's a seamstress). It's kinda like soft, but shiny gray with small pink chinese flower pattern on it. it's a strapless dress, kneelength, insanely tight (I feel like a corseted Victorian virgin. well maybe not virgin), with slits on the side. I'm sorry but wearing that dress, my ass looks bangin. yeah. the reception wasa shitload of fun. I have never had that much fun in a chinese wedding. But I will elaborate later on cuz there are tons of fun stuff. Anyways I went home with a fresh bottle of Absolute Vodka, and a candle. yeah. and then I went to bed. And here I am now. All alcoholed out.  Peace!

      I got paid today. Shit. I get paid every two weeks and a week ago I started officially on full-time salary (and benefits and shit), before that I was working temporarily making 8 bucks an hour. SO anyways I just looked at my check and shiiit there's a lot more. I mean, granted I'm not making THAT much, but for a poor ol' thang like moi, it's way more than enough. It will afford me to eat out as much as I can. YEAH. hehehehe. So anyways that's good. I'm psyched. Anyways I'm gonna go. I'm fucking tired as shit. It's the weekend, thank God. Tonight a bunch of my friends are coming over to hang out, drink, do drugs, whatever us young people do. And Sunday is Elliot's 21st birthday, and my cousin's wedding. So that should be fun. Alright peeps. Have a good weekend. Peace!

      I am still at work. It's 6PM. I want throw my computer out the window. I'm so tired grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr I want to go home. Shit man, this is one of the moments during the whole production/editorial cycle where I usually go insane. It's two weeks from hell and it has started. I'm tired, stressed out, burnt, and my eyes hurt from intensely starting at the monitor for almost 10 hours now. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccckkkk!! Anyways on a lighter note, I met Sedaris two days ago, and got the book signed yeaaah and it's fucking hysterical. I'm going to leave you with a paragraph from one of the stories in the book. It's called Bloodwork.  A little background: in this particular tale, Sedaris was working as a cleaner. He used to go to ppl's houses and well, cleaned them. This is right befor/around him starting the NPR gig.   "One such client was a claims adjuster in his mid-sixties. I'd been cleaning his apartment for over a year and finally met him while he was at home recovering from an operation. He had some kind of a heart condition and approached me while I was cleaning out his refrigerator. 'I hate to bother you,' he said, 'but I'm going to lie down for a while. I've set the alarm, but if for some reason I don't wake up, I'm wondering if you can possibily insert this into my anus.' He handed me a rubber glove and a transucent lozenge filled with amber liquid.  'If you're not awake by when?' I asked.  'Oh, say, three o'clock.'  He went into the bedroom and I started wondering what I'd do if the alarm failed to rouse him. Which was worse -- inserting a lozenge into a stranger's anus or feeling responsible when his heart stopped beating? As with most things, I supposed it all depended upon the person. The man had never complained to my boss or asked me to do his laundry, and he  had  been thoughtful enough to provide me with a rubber glove, so who was I to deny him this one favor?"   Peace out!!

      Is the name of Sedaris' new book. I'm leaving work in five minutes and then I'm going to Barnes and Noble, the one in Union Square, cuz Sedaris is gonna be there signing and reading!!!!! Weeeeeeeee! I'm so excited. I love Sedaris. He's so witty, and fucking hysterical. It's great. I'm excited to see him although I wouldn't know what to say tho.. "umm you rock?" Whatever. Anyways I gotta go. I'll do a weekend recap tomorrow or sumthin. Basically the party was a major success, about 25/30 ppl (roughly half of the total amount of the ppl that came) actually wore costumes. I didn't dress up as Alex from Clockwork Orange and I dressed up as Pocahontas instead. But for somereason the costume was a little tight so I was kinda like sexy pocahontas haha. It was fun. I had a feather in my hair and red paint on my cheeks, and fringes, and braids and stuff. Awesome. There were TONS of drama that happened that night but I'll get into it tomorrow. On saturday me, Elliot, Luke, and Alan tripped on E and it was fucking great. I hadn't done E in like 6 months so that was pretty cool. Anyways now I really have to go. I'll leave you with some Sedaris' quotes that I like:  "Why refer to Lady Crack Pipe or Good Sir Dishrag when these things could never live up to all that their sex implied"  ------from: Me Talk pretty One Day  "My hands tend to be full enough dealing with people who hate me for who I am. Concentrate too hard on the millions of people who hate you for what you are and you're likely to turn into one of those unkempt, sloppy dressers who sag beneath the weight of the two hundred political buttons they wear pinned to their coats and knapsacks."  ---- from: Naked   Peace everyone!

I got bored with my model pretty fast so I made a studly model, named him Antonio, and dressed him up.

       *all pictures courtesy of Getty Images    *i need to get a digi-cam. &nbsp;    &nbsp;           Great .  I just wrote an hour long post on this stupid blogger shit and right before I was gonna publish it and then it completely froze. FUCK.    So now I will have to make a short version of it cuz I'm getting pissed off.    Basically on Monday I've decided to fuck everything and start my life the way I want it. I am not taking the class, meaning I won't graduate in time, and I won't be able to apply for the work permit. Meaning in October when my visa runs out I'll have to go back, or live here "unconventionally", and I'm going to do the latter one.     &nbsp;   My reasoning behind this is that:    1. Even if I do take the class, spend 1600 bucks on it, and then spend 800 on laywer fees, and then 1200 fee for the visa application, I might not get it. I talked to two lawyers and both of them told me that I have a slim to none chance of getting it. So that means I would waste almost 4000 bucks on shit. 4000 that I don't have.    2. Even if by some miracle I DO get the visa, that means for the next six years of my life I will have to keep a full time 9-5 job, and then maybe I can apply for a greencard. See I rather eat my own feet than do that.    3.I have decided a while back that I want to be a travel photojournalist. And also as corny as it may sound, write a book. I'm a writer, and I love writing. But I need time and energy to write. since I started working 9-5 I haven't written anything for myself that's very upsetting. So with this decision, when November comes around, and I'll be here, working as a bartender somewhere making enough just for rent and food, on the other side of the coin I will have a lot of time to write, and be very, very happy. I want to stop talking about how I want to be a freelance travel writer and I'm going to start doing it.       So   in a nutshell, that's my decision. it's completely insane and anyone that knows anything about int. students and visas and stuff would never advise it, but fuck all that. what am I gonna do? Go home in november, get a crappy job back in jakarta and get married? No fucking way. I rather stay here and be broke but doing what I want and love than do that. Money was never that important for me anyways. I don't even go shopping. it might be crazy, it might be stupid or naive, but I've thought about it, and I don't want to be miserable. And I have been miserable. I need to look out for myself and if the path I happen to choose might not be the smart, conventional way, so be it. I'll be happier in the long run. Whatever happens, happens. At least I'll give it my all. I just don't want to conform. I won't settle. I will not be fucking defeated. &nbsp;      The only thing that sucks is the fact that once I start doing this, I won't be able to go home to Jakarta, or I can't come back here. It's really weird and overwhelming and heartbreaking, knowing that I will have to live the next 3 or 5 or whatever years of my life without visiting home. jakarta, my family, my little brother, my house. but it's okay.    Jakarta will always be there.       &nbsp;         I know my parents would not be happy with this, they're gonna want me to go home and stuff, but I think eventually they understand. All my life I have been making decisions about what I want to do with my family in mind, but this time, i have me in mind.&nbsp;    Fuck everything, I'm moving on.    Watch   me soar. &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

       I am such a pussy. I can't believe I'm crying right now.&nbsp; I'm crying because I'm so fucking frustrated trying to take care of stupid shit. Okay, so you know my whole situation with the visa and shit like that, right. Basically I am 3 credits away from graduation, I am registered to graduate in september and my visa runs out in october, at which by then i should be applying/getting a work permit.   So I've been going back and forth school office school office trying to take care of this shit. Apparently because I wasn't in school last semester they dropped me off from enrollment and I'm screwed, basically. So because of that I can't just take a regular summer class, I have to take it as a non-degree student and then re-enroll to my school. I mean, couldn't they have send me a letter or an email or whatever at least to tell me that I'm not a student there anymore? jesus fucking christ. at least fucking tell me. anyways so now I'm trying to take this summer class at Hunter, and the class starts today. I went there on thursday and they told me I need to get my school to send my transcript to them on monday, so i have proof of education. So today I called my school and ask them to send my transcript to hunter, which will take approximately 2 seconds.&nbsp; so i started talking to them this morning at 9.30. they told me that i can't do it. that i need to submit a transcript request form and that it will take me weeks until they can process is. why? because they're fucking assholes. so i hung up the phone. called my friend at hunter and she's like, dude my school only takes 5 mins to do a transcript request. and her school and my school are sister schools, we're all crappy CUNY schools.   so I called my school back, explaining to them the situation that is there any way I can do to speed up the process? They said submit the request to the fax and maybe we'll take care of it.  maybe .   i should've fucking known. anyway so i sent the fax, went back to work blabla, at about 1 pm i decided to call them, just to make sure they're working on it. i called them and someone else picks up and put me on hold for 20 mins. then i hung up call again and someone else picks up and put me on hold for 15 mins. so i hung up, and the minute someone picked up the phone, i told them the situation, that if they don't fucking get my transcript to hunter today, i won't be able to reguster for the class because today is the deadline and then i won't be able to graduate and i will be thrown out of the country, of course i said it very nicely and polite. SO i asked them if there's ANY way anyone can help me. so they put me on hold for 10 minutes, then a nasty lady picked up the phone and told me that there's nothing they can do. i repeated what i just said to her and she said alright there's no supervisors here i don't know what to tell you, noone is here. i asked her again, nicely. she said okay they're working on it and they'll send it out to hunter tomorrow. i said tomorrow is def. not good. the whole point is today, nicely of couse. and then i asked her, what if i just go there, pick up the transcript and then bring it to hunter. she said hold on. i held on for 15 more mins. by now im def. starting to get really  pissed.     but i'm still trying to be calm.   so anyways, after holding on, apparently the supervisor is suddenly there, and then we're talking.   this fucking son of a bitch is the nastiest motherfucker ever. he has this fucking stupid ass spanish accent and was condescending from the first minute we talked. the first thing that he said to me was:    &nbsp;  MF (MotherFucker): "You need to bring proof that if we don't get you a transcript that youll be thrown out oft he country"   Me: Excuse me?   MF: Proof. You need proof. You can just come in here making up some little sob story and expect us to believe you and just let you get a transcript while everyone have to wait for weeks.   Me: I understand. But first of all, I didn't make up a story. I am in a very difficult situation and I'm just asking if you can help me with it.   MF: Well you need proof. You're saying that if we don't issue you a transcript you'll get thrown out of the country, that's some serious danger right there so you bettter not be lying.   Me: Well I don't know what to tell you I am not lying. I am not saying that ...   MF: (cutting me off) Well you need to bring proof. Proof. You can't just come here with your sob little story.   Me: It's not a story! (Still nicely) Can I just explain to you what the situation is, cuz you're not understanding me.   MF: Yeah.   Me: I'm not saying that if you don't issue me a transcript you'll be the reason I'll get thrown out of the country. What is happening is that (BLABLABLA-explaining same story AGAIN for 10 minutes). And I am not trying to make up any kinda story or lying or anything like that, I'm asking for a little compassion and I honestly was just wondering if you can help me or not.   MF: Well you come here and pick it up now. I'll issue it to you but this is it I don't want to hear any more of your little sob stories. I remember your name, you can't pull this kinda thing agaiN! (raising voice)   Me (shocked) I am not trying to pull anything   MF: Right there you're insulting my intelligence. Just come and pick it up but don't&nbsp;come here ever again I'll remember your name.   Me: (in complete shock) I am not trying to insult anyone if anything you're insulting me.   MF: Quit while you're ahead miss, just quit while you're ahead.   Me: But I am not trying to pull any kind of story. This is a very simple situation.   MF: I told you to quit while you're ahead. That's it. You're completely insulting me now. I'll do this to you only once and that's it. No more of your sob little stories, you think you can just make up some lie and get ahead of everyone. All of this is your own fault anyways and now you're coming to us crying with some lie. Well we're not buying it. BLABLABLABlaBla...........    &nbsp;  (he wouldn't let me talk and kept insulting me. WTF?)    &nbsp;  So after about 10 minutes of more arguing. I said "You know what, FUCK YOU, I DON'T WANT YOUR STUPID FUCKING TRANSCRIPT!" and hung up.    &nbsp;  I can't not fucking believe that a school official can be like that to a student. if it weren't for us, he wouldn't have a fucking job. his fucking job there is HELP the students, wtf? That's his one and only job, not to be a fucking assh9oles and say things that are completely out of line. WHAT THE FUCK? it's fucking ridiculour. it is a fucking transcript afterall. the shit is in the fucking computer&nbsp; and all you have to do is put in the number, print it out and voila you stupid fucking apes.&nbsp; it's MY transcript. WTHAT THE FUCK. how dare he fucking yell at me and tell me shit like that? that's completely out of line. what the fuck what the fuck. and don't fucking tell me to not ever come back there again and that you're doing this huge ass favor to me by pressing your fat little fingers on the keyboard for five seconds and then press print?? It's MY FUCKING TRANSCRIPT, if i want fifty fucking copies of it every week you fucking do it because it's my right and that's your fucking job.   I'm going home. I'm so fucking tired, fed-up and just done with all this shit. fuck the class, fuck the transcript, fuck the visa. fuck everything. from now on, i'm doing everything MY way. My fucking way. I don't give a shit anymore.&nbsp; Fuck this shit.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      i'm kidding. he's not hot at all. i just couldn't think of anyone else that's greek.  so i haven't writing on this shit for about a week. I've been mad lazy, bored, depressed, and upset. Probably from the shit that my school is giving me about getting my diploma, or maybe from the complicated impossible im screwed in the ass repeatedly with a lightsabre process of getting a work visa, or maybe from the alcohol, pot, ecstasy, coke, vicodine, and xanax I've taken since Friday night. maybe i'm just bored.  so im thinking about moving to germany, if my visa shit doesn't happen. i'm gonna go into detail about it but basically im screwed, partly my own fault but mostly my school's fault. FUCK CUNY! Who gives a flying monkey shit about your newly planted green fake ass looking grass, or your glass revolving door at the entrance of the library, or your newly installed gross vomit colored tiles in the bathroom, or the new flat screen bootleg computer monitors? WHO GIVES A FUCKING SHIT? take a look at your fucking school from the inside, dickheads. Look at what matters! Look at your students, every single one of them that keeps getting screwed by your incompetent apes working as administrator and advisors and staff and shit. Look at them. Look at how many fucking students are deep in debt because you wouldn't let them get their grades in one minute late and had to retake the same stupid fucking class. Look at how many fucking students been looking fat and pale from your sickly prison style cafetaria food? Fuck the grass, fuck the glass doors, fuck the tiles, fucking use your fucking money to hire real human beings to work in the school and let the fucking apes run free in fucking jersey. Jesus christ CUNY you fucking suck!   On a lighter note, I've been having fun toying with the image of me being an immigrant in europe running from one country to the next living like a mysterious bohemian.

       okay. here we go:      -last weekend was great. got trashed at smitty's on friday. i woke up covered in shit. newspapers, those orange street cones, lip-gloss drawings of cocks all over me, a wedgie, a bruise, and a hangover. my friends had a little party with me once i passed out.    -saw the village. joaquin phoenix is a god.    -went to curiosa on saturday. once i got the pics done and stuff ill post them. it was sick. rapture was fucking great, interpol was fucking great, and the cure were fucking unfuckingbelievable. it was surreal. i had been a cure fan since i was back in jakarta and on friday i couldnt believe myself that i was standing 20 feet away from The Man, Robert Smith. It was amazing. They had 2 encores, and they played for a total of an hour and forty minutes, I think. They ended the show with Boys Don't Cry, which was so sick. They're so great.   -we hung out on sunday in the house. people came over. we hung out on the roof.   -after i went to bed that night, around 4 am Luke, Scott, lil Chris, and big Frank got arrested. They were on the roof and then choppers came, 3 cop cars, one emergency cop truck, etcs telling them to get off the roof. they handcuffed them and took them in. the cops thought they were terrorist. wow, fucking geniuses. luke looks like a little punk kid, scott it a sweaty irish alcoholic with a beer belly, little chris looks like he was five, and big frank, well big frank's just cool. so anyways they let him go after an hour, because it took them as long as an hour to finally discover that they're idiots and hmm, maybe these kids are just kids.   -i found out that i am flying to cali not this weekend but next weekend to interview G. Lopez for the 3rd issue's cover story. that's gonna be sick. jordan might come and see me for a day he said, but i dont think that's a good idea cuz ill be working all weekend.   -after cali, there's a big possibility that i might go straight to hawaii for another story. this might and might not happen, we'll see. keep your fingers crossed cuz if i go, i'll def. put up some slutty drunk bikini pictures on here. oh wait im supposed to be working. well.   -i'm going to visit jordan soon. first week of september. i'm taking all my vacation days before i quit. so yeah ima stay with him for about 4/5 days and then maybe hang out with mr.brush oc-style for a couple of days. im so excited.    -my mom called. my sister started college. she got a new bestfriend. she's the 17 y/o model that my 25y/o exboyfriend now dates. weird.   -my mom told me that she doesn't want me to marry an american guy, because they're all either broke-asses or cheap. she told me to start dating older, rich indonesian guys. i managed to change her mind after i told her that if i marry an american guy, i will have the most beautiful babies in the world and we can totally cash in on them alla jessica and ashlee simpson.   -yup yup. that's the plan now. get married and have babies. ASAP. Anyone? No takers? Anyone?    aw shucks. =p
