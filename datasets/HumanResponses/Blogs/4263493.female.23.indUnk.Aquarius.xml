      Then its time for vacation! wooo! I can't wait.. 5 days away from wonderful work. Going with my bf, and 2 friends. We rented a cottage in Ohio and are staying from Monday - Saturday.. probably going to be drinking alot! We are doing horseback riding, hiking, fishing.. lots of fun stuff.  I will just be glad to get away.. I have never been on a "real" vacation.  I will write when I get back, Gotta go.. my power supply on my computer is messed up. The fan isn't working right.. need to shut down before it over heats!

      I feel like complete and total crap right now. I just woke up, and the thing is I went to sleep around 2:30am.. so thats almost 12 hours.  I think it's because of the way I've been working. I worked 9p-6a both Saturday and Sunday nights. (So I got off work at 6am on Monday morning).. then was BACK to work at 8am on Tuesday morning. So it was like I had a little over 24 hours to flip my sleep schedule.  And the best part.. I go back to midnight shift tonight. Someone please tell me this is healthy?  I was so sick and dizzy last night before I passed out (which is litterally what I did.. it wasn't "going to bed" it was falling alseep with the lights, tv, and computer all on..)  All I have to say.. is Thank God my vacation is coming very soon. I don't think I can do this much more.  The thing that isn't fair, is only 2 of the management people have to work crappy shifts like this. The other ones don't.. maybe it's because the one babysits the manager's kids. Who knows? But it's not fair!

      Just a short post to introduce myself. I am 23 years old.. female. I am an Assistant Manager for a local convience store.. lets call it "Bedspreadz" (Anyone from PA, MD, WV.. will know what I'm talking about ;))  I work alot, and my schedule is always messed up .. which leaves for a cranky, tired.. bitchy person. LOL ..  Right now I'm not in too bad of a mood, simply because I am leaving for vacation in less than a week. Me, my boyfriend (We've been together 8 years), and two people I work with rented a cottage in Ohio. It's going to be one wonderful fun week of being drunk!  I have just recently turned into a total alcholic. But you gotta enjoy life when you are young. However, I always take my turn being the designated driver!  Anyways.. gonna go watch Nip/Tuck and finish cleaning.
