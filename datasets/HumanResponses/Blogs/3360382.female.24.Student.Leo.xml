      Romanda Cooper Blog Entry #3 Module #3 May 30, 2004   Washington Post Article Posted May 18, 2004 Article title:  A Baby, or Cash Back    Is this ethically correct?  According to the Washington Post some fertility clinics offer shared risk programs which gives patients an opportunity to receive cash back if the vitro-fertilization isn’t successful.  Technically, patients are able to go through three cycles of trying to become pregnant and they are charged an upfront fee of $20,000 which will be refunded if the woman does not become pregnant.  If the woman becomes pregnant they will not be refunded and if a patient would like to try a fourth time if they did not become pregnant after the third time they are charged an additional fee for each cycle.   	 I feel that this is an ethical situation being that the patient gets the right to refuse and accept options and also their wishes are granted, accepted and respected at the same time.  Moreover, the individuals whom go through the process of the shared risk program will be guaranteed their cash if the process does not go as planned which is a positive outcome.    Please feel free to comment I would like to know your opinions.  The Washington Post May 18, 2004. Article: A Baby, or Cash Back. By: Lisa Barrett Mann Retrieved on May 19, 2004.

      Romanda Cooper  Blog Entry #2   Module #2  May 23, 2004  	Interestingly, while browsing the web I came across a network established by a committee and institutions in Indiana specifically developed to help establish and structure ethical issues.  The Indiana Healthcare Ethics Networks (IHEN) “seeks to be a critical resource for healthcare facilities and others that struggle with ethical dimensions of contemporary healthcare”(http://shaw.medlib.iupui.edu/ethics/ihen.html).     This Ethics Network offers services such as:  Ethic News (which are issues published quarterly by the network on healthcare ethical issues), Literature Reviews, Annual Ethics Conferences, and a Statewide Dialogue.   	I personally feel that this approach can be very resourceful and educational for healthcare institutions and facilities seeking a plan to re-engineer or restructure their services.  The Indiana Healthcare Ethics Network not only offers services and article issues on the web it also gives institutions the opportunity to make appointments to discuss their ethical issues with the individuals of the committee.   	Moreover, the Annual Ethics Conference held by the (IHEN) includes seminars specifically addressing “Legal and Ethical Myths of Informed Consent and many other ethical issues”( http://shaw.medlib.iupui.edu/ethics/ihen.html).  Technically speaking, ethical issues usually generate from different judgments and propositions whether informal or formal.  Certain ethical issues arise from individuals not knowing the difference in fact and fiction or right and wrong.  Lastly, I feel that this approach is a great way to deal with current ethical issues and it should be formulated around all institutions around the states.  Certain protocols should and need to be taken into account when dealing with issues that will drastically change operations and plans in the challenging world of healthcare.

      Romanda Cooper (Blog Entry Week 1)  While browsing the readings for the week I chose to respond to the website http://www.nbwa.org.au/pdfs/EthicalDile.pdf this site discussed decision making as oppose to nurses making ethical decisions about different clinical and personal issues on a daily basis as oppose to patients needs.  I personally feel that it is very important to have knowledge of values and situations that will place you in making a decision about someone's health and/or life.  Secondly, the patients should be able to feel confident that their caregiver or health provider is competent of personal values and understand that everyone's values and decisions are different sometimes and it all comes down to respecting the other wishes, thoughts, and judgments.

      Romanda Cooper  While briefly surfing the web on current health care related issues I came across a quite interesting article titled, "Racist Health Care" by Verneilla R. Randall a professor of law and web editor.  In this article Vernellia exclaimed how "racism remains a prime cause of the unequal and racially discriminatory provision of the funds for health services;  of the underutilization of white hospitals; of miserable housing, gross pollution, poor sanitation, and lack of health care"(www.academic.udayton.edu/health/racist.htm).    In the article Vernellia went on to say how possibilities such as high cost were some reasons why healthcare is and maybe too high for some African Americans.  Also, she feels that some of the sickness in the black community can be eliminated if America would offer the services in a moderately affordable sense that will accomadate the black population.  Also, Vernellia goes on to say how she feels that "the black community does not get a chance to participate in any decisions or allocations concening resources in healthcare today"(www.academic.udayton.edu/health/racist.htm).    I personally feel that the black population have an opportunity to react to certain resources concerning healthcare it just that they do not know how to find the resources.  Speaking for myself I think African Americans feel that they are shadowed out because of discrimination issues and feel that they cannot do anything about systems that they cannot change.  Some people see that the healthcare is costly and decide to overlook the health plans so they go without it and it's not just the black population it's white, hispanics and other ethnic backgrounds.  I think there needs to be a health care awareness campaign done yearly that will educate all Americans on healthcare and what they should and did no know.  I personally feel that it is unethical that predominatley black hospitals are ill equipped as oppose to white hospitals and that there is a fund shortage due to unequal services.  To the reader of this entry feel free to give your insight on this article.    Racist Health Care.  Race, Health Care and the Law.  Speaking Truth to Power .  By Vernella R. Randall.

      Romanda Cooper   Laws Shroud Secret Killer in Hospitals By Mark Douglas Tampa Tribune Mulitmedia Reports   According to the Tampa Tribunes Multimedia Reports in Bradenton a woman was diagnosed with an infection known as (MOTTS-mycobacterium) she was infected after a "surgery to replace silicone breast implants inserted after cancer surgery"(multimedia.tbo.com).  The woman's surgery was done at Manatee Memorial Hospital where she was an employee also  at the time of the surgery.  The news report goes on to explain how the news station in Tampa instructed twenty-nine hospitals in Tampa Bay to disclose any information on nosocomial rates in their hospitals.  It also gave information on how there is silence closure when it comes to giving out nosocomial information.  According to the news report the CDC says, "an estimate of 5 percent infection rate nationally in 2001 translates into 2 million patients contracting infections, with 88,000 dying as a result"(multimedia.tbo.com).  As a result of the surgery and infection the woman is suffering from severe body configurations such as:  a disfigured torso and hole in her chest.  The woman is suing her former employer(Manatee Memorial Hospital)and she exclaimed that,"contaminated water fed into the hospital which was the original source of the bacteria"(multimedia.tbo.com).  Ironically, I am currently assigned to a debate topic: (affirmative) Do Healthcare Administrators have an ethical duty to report mistakes?  I stand strong for this argument saying that it is ethical for them report mistakes and in this case if this nosocomial was reported and resolved before these types of cases would not be in courthouse case files today.  Apparently, they are keeping silence due to reputation but infection cases should be handled up front and taking care of immediately and not disclosed.    Laws Shroud Secret Killer In Hospitals.

       Romanda Cooper   As oppose to training and development should all businesses and/or organizations follow an code of ethics?    In an article titled  Right Thing-business ethics , the effect of organizational ethics was questioned in reference to companies having larger market values due to more commitment to ethics within the company.  According to the article, "a study of 300 large firms found that companies that make an explicit commitment to follow an ethics code provided more than twice the value to shareholders than companies that didn't"(articles.findarticles.com).  Usually when employees can feel comfortable with making ethical decisions at work the organization/company itself gains value because the employee gains confidence in their decisions and are fully committed to facing ethical issues.  When there are conflicts within the company as oppose to an employees personal values(rights,wrongs,perceptions on different situations) an employee is probably being disagreeable on code of ethics within the company and their personal values.  I personally feel that it is a good idea that all businesses or companies implement the use of organizational ethics because an effective program can have a positive affect internally and externally.  All companies should probably have some kind of organizational values, cultural values, and culture characteristics this type of organizational commitment would help the entire company when needing answers when ethical dilemma's arise.

       (Cont'd Personal Reflection)  Romanda Cooper  Should I go outside of the University to seek advice?  So far, I have not accomplished anything since last week's blog assignment.  Since last week's entry I have contacted the University of Central Florida's Human Resources Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity office on campus as well in  regards to the discrimination issue I am currently facing at work. When I paid a visit to the Equal Opportunity Office the person I needed to speak to was out of the office therefore I was instructed to email her.  Unfortunately, I emailed her an hour after leaving the office which was on Tuesday June 8, 2004.  It seems apparently awkward that she did not respond back to me by email after I contacted her by phone the next day which was Wednesday June 9, 2004.  Should I take this situation to another individual whom has an authority position within the University or should I seek Legal Services.  I personally feel that it is purposely being overlooked by the individuals whom are aware of the situation because no one has made any responses to my contacts nor my fellow co-workers who are following the same procedures as oppose to getting advice.   I am terribly moved by this situation and feel that it is going to be pushed under the rug because our voices are purposely being ignored.  I think if someone from outside of the University were to take a stance and mention this situation to the director of the facility there maybe a chance to resolve this issue or maybe even get a record going on the supervisor.

      Romanda Cooper June 6, 2004   A Personal Reflection   What should I do?????      I have been off from work for a month due to hour shortage and too many employees on staff.  On May 5th my supervisor informed me that my hours would be decreased for the first half of the summer because our hours of operation changes over the summer so therefore we close earlier than usual.  On that note some of the hours will be cut down because the employees whom usually work night shifts will need day hours for the summer.  I understood this change and accepted the fact that I am a part time employee and hours are not quaranteed to me.  However, shortly before my last day a full time employee quit which means that forty hours were available and also two part time employees quit making an additional twenty or thirty hours available.  Interestingly, my supervisor did not mention the hours available to me but she begin interviewing outside people to fill the spots.     In case you are wondering I wasn't terminated I was just told that I did not have hours available for me in the summer in which I only needed twenty hours.  Also, I wasn't the only employee facing this same dilemma three other employees are facing the hour shortage(supposedly).  Furthermore, I have been informed by at least three of my co-workers that my supervisor hired an employee just a week ago and she is part time;I did not mention i that all the employees that were given hardly no hours including myself are all african-american.  I do not intend to upset anyone by making this comment or feeling this way because I see no color difference I think everybody's the same we just have different ways, act different, and see things differently sometimes. I personally feel that it is a discrimination issue, the reason I feel this way is because I have been an employee at this facility going on two years this August and this has never happened until a new supervisor came along and she just happens to be white and ironically the young lady she just hired happens to be white also.       I would like to close and just say this is not a race issue with me or anything it just seems to me that my supervisor has a slight discrimination problem because there are other incidents that have went on and no one has complained or done anything.     My question to any readers of my personal issue is: do you think this is a problem or am I taking it too far?  I honestly feel that this is a problem that needs to be taking to higher management because for no reason should someone hire another individual when it is shortage of hours in-house but they hire outside of the employees whom are already staffed.
