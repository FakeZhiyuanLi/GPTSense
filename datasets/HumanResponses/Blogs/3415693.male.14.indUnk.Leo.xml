      Yes, I have returned.  I was just informed that Funky (no, it's not an alias) the waiter at the Mellow Mushroom remembered us.  the mellow mushroom is an extremely pimplicious restaurant i have visited on numerous occasions on our trips down to Strawberry Fields(yet another alias.  I am filled with mystery.), the whimsical village in which we are relocating to.  Funky is a drop-out waiter from Vanderbilt, hence it being on campus.  Being our server for every time we have gone to the shroom, he remembered us.  And that is that.  I am way too mysterious with my aliases for my own liking.

      Once again, I say heloo to you.  I am going under the alias Roy so as to keep this a blog of anonymous thoughts...  More will come.  Goodbye. Oh- and the name is a Beatles song... I was pressed for time, so it will have to do.  roy has left the building.

      Yes.  I have returned.  A nervewracking thought that all 5 of my season finales have taken place as of tonight.  Oy.  I really have no interest in the tele anymore until October 29th.  I do, however, enjoy a good film over the summer.  Hence me really wanting to see the Terminal with Tom Hanks-- my kind of movie.  
My blog is like a mute parrot: pretty and well-kept, but silent and unnoticed.  Therefore, I may just have to be rid of it sometime soon.  Oy.

I will retire to the parlor for tea and crumpets now.

      I would like to give a shout out to Cate, who assisted in the creation of my pimplicious icon.  it is cool though, ain't it?

The 2nd most hilarious SNL rerun of the season is on tonight... with Lindsey Lohan and Usher(both of who i dislike), but it's uber-funny nonetheless.  included is debbie downer (which made me cry with laughter), and a skit about harry potter in which lindsey plays hermione... but some of us won't appreciate the humor in that one.:-D

Today i did hundreds of crunchies.  the pain still resides.  oy.

Forget the other tidbits.  I will say no more.

      (I have edited the original title for the sake of Diana, who thought it was harsh.)

Oy... today alone, i have recalled over a dozen things the Alfonso didn't include in the movie.  Like big, pivotal things too!(cho chang, analyzing trelawney's prediction, no moony, wormtail, padfoot, or prongs, zilch.)  i have now concluded that it was agood movie, but when we think about staying to the book, alfonso should go back to mexico.

I'm studying for my geometry final... eight chapters.  crazed indeed. and, with or without rain, tonight will be a w00t-- either swimming or watching lotr.  wowser. and the tony awards are on tomorrow night, taboot.  

an ending note-- buy "a rush of blood to the head" by coldplay.  it is uber-excellent.

i'm off to expand the mind, yo... kicking it with some britpop and my ti-83.

      Hello, yo... harry potter brought out some mixed feelings.  It was very well done, overall, i would have to say, but when Harry became dazzled with the notion of living in the country with Sirius, i kind of faded.  Anyway.... the recap.

-Enjoyed Profusely-

    -The very different cinematography.  It was a lot more interesting.
    -all three of the kids acting.  it was much improved... and very good, for that matter.
    -the jamaican head on the knight bus.  rasta spirit, yo.... not really.  he had two amusing lines.
    -emma thompson... who was very entertaining, hence the turning on of i to her thanks to cate.
    -the company of newly identified st.matts-ees.  awwwwwwww.
    -gary oldman and lupin.  actually, scratch that.... i don't know if there was one bad actor in this one.

-Disliked (alot(I would have done an inbetweener category, but i have other things to attend to.))-

    -the few horrible lines in the end... i.e. harry's inner desires to the country with his ex-convict godfather.  hmm.... that's sweet. i guess.
    -the extremely pointless and unwanted ending.  harry frolics over into a courtyard to fly on his broomstick.  and the last frame is a flattering shot of daniel radcliffe's windswept face.  alfonso obviously thought it was tasty.
    -what happened to the explanation of the maurader's map???? moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongs???? that sure pronged my padfoot.  alfonso is a wormtail.  i'm too creative for my own good.

  
    Overall, it was very good however.  WAY better than the preceding two.  and very cool to finally meet cate and alex (i am unaware of your catchy nickname... apologies.).  And of course, the amusing chitting with diana.  the conversation strayed, but it was interesting. OH YES! and there were these horrible people behind us who were chastizing(yes.) us to no end while we were in line.  for having cate and alex and such hop in line with us.  she popped in a couple of snide remarks that i couldn't make out... diana can tell you about that.:-D
  
  Wow... my longest blog entry.  That just means i am a humble man of few words... not a bad thing to be.  oh... and a strange genius.  not bad, either.  A footnote-- I am listening to the very pimplicious soundtrack of School of Rock, compliments of Cate.

      Hello... i made a profile for my blog.  It is superb, and i am self-effacing.

Tomorrow is our pahhty for our farewell.  entailed is bowling, pizza, food, prizes, dancing, and a grand prize of a brand new car.  oy.  it will be fun, though.

i am seeing harry potter on friday here in 
   green hills  , tennessee.  it does look the best of all three so far, anyways.

      'ello.  Little Royette is "visiting" with me here in my shack.  we are having a rollicking good time with Eenis and the ferret.  good times, good times.

Royette (obviously another clever alias) is off to camp next week for a week.  she is very excited.  and i am excited for her.  yay.

we're going to our childhood home this weekend.  and we may just bring Eenis.  awww-- we are softies.  i'll be off now-- camp is good, as are childhood homes.  and Eenis.

      what do you think of me now, yo? i am now in the ninth grade, and will bask in this thought for a while.  wow.

my basking is done.

today, i reached level 12 on snood.  and i went to galleghers. but that doesn't need to be discussed because of the events that took place there.

i biked to my sister's softball game, along with my posse of mosquitos.  it was toit, yo.  the game was good.  hooray for softball.

and then we went to burger king. where i saw vickie bell and others.  woo hoo.

hmm... i'd like to thank those who cherish me, especially my newfound poochie.  may you be proud to be in this position, for you shall hold it for eternity. amen.

i am so glad summer is here.  tomorrow morn, i shall wake, make a smoothie, go swimming, watch a movie, read, talk to yo, and go to bed again.  i must burst into song.

      greetings.

today, i gave many a request to visit my blog (i.e. jordan, etc.). so hello to those who so graciously followed my instructions.

the last two days of school are always a mixture of pointlessness and cool things.  for instance, yearbooks, watching excessive amounts of movies like remember the titans, and cool food all day are all very cool.

jordan is giving me a picture of a jesus action figure.  it may deserve a frame.... :).

tomorrow we may play night games, and to those of you i have mentioned it to, i will get a hold of you.

      It is a very sad thing that Reagan died... he was, actually, a good president in my opinion.  And Alzheimer's is really depressing.  Oh well.  Cheers to Reagan.

I don't mean to be negative in the last two days of school, but Jewish Anna is chastizing/ignoring me to no end, even after our apology on friday.  i have no idea what went on, and if this is to be fixed, she needs to do it.  I've tried numerous times to ask what i did, but i am given the cold shoulder.  i would appreciate it if she did attempt to make things write, seeing as i have done my part.  it would benefit the well being of both of us.

      Hello.  Monk was very good... if you read this within the next 37 minutes (according to my new and improved correctly-timed posting time stamp), you'll be able to catch the repeat of it.  Monk is so very funny... and Tony Shaloub is especially hilarious.  And i always enjoyed the tagline for the show-- 'Obsessive. Compulsive. Detective.'

And that's all I have to say about that.

As you can see, I made another ch-ch-ch-ch-change (the best phrase of that song is 'time may change me, but i can't trace time'.  it's very catchy.  pick up the shrek 2 soundtrack.... there's an interesting version of that song with butterfly boucher, this australian pop singer.  and now i'll go back from my tangent.)  I thought the blog-o needed some color (but it's pronounced 'cuh-la'.  if you ever see me and care to know, ask and i'll pronounce it.  hee.)  except this new template has kind of screwed it up, and i don't know why. it won't let me type a title for my posts, so this one may remain nameless.

I didn't see the Terminal, but i am going back to childhood home tomorrow. So all is well.
I've decided to spice up my question-ish conclusion-- instead of George Carlin, I think I'll go to Will Ferrell/Harry Caray.

      Obviously it won't matter to those who are reading this because you have obviously coped with my revampment fine enough to get youreselves here, but to those of us who may be 'out of it', i have changed my blog title-- another groovy beatles song.  i.e. urlLink The Fool on the Hill  (c. 1967, thank you very much.  i know my beatles trivia.  w00t.)  I think i'll keep the url the same for logistical reasons, unless of course i put up my site meter to reassure myself that i really don't have much of an audience anyway.  pfut.  anyway... i enjoy blogging, so such as life.

      Yo... we watched all three lotr movies.  it's was great... although i did doze for about a half hour during the minas tirith battle.  hee.  it was very fun.

Hence my title, I found myself aimlessly surfing the web today, and came across this....  urlLink the theme song for clarissa explains it all , one of the numerous old school nickelodeon shows during the 90s.  i especially like the episode where ferguson 'explains it all'.  and the little musical doodad when sam, clarissa's friend, hops in her window to talk.  i also enjoyed hey dude and salute your shorts.  now nickelodeon is infiltrated with garbagio, like rocket power and chalk zone.  blegh.  although spongebob and fairly oddparents are definitely very good, still.

i'm getting a hair 'trim' today, and i might see the terminal.  

and to be kind, my pondering thoughts i've included lately are actually courtesy of an e-mail of George Carlin's one-liners.  apologies.  nonetheless, here---If 4 out of 5 people SUFFER from diarrhea...does that mean that one enjoys it?

We made an extreme grocery run for cheese popcorn, slice, and other unneeded sweet foods.  Yes.... although i did set up the ddr pads so we can burn our artificial cheese flavorings and such away.

      this was titled based on the song i last listened to.  a bit random. hee... we got a cheap dean martin cd at target that i'm really enjoying.  anyway, i suspect mallory, now that she's discovered my blog, will be secretly checking up on it when i'm not around. so hi mal. :D

anyway.... today i got my braces off.  my mouth is very barren. and painful.  this whole morning was painful-- i woke up early, and then when i got there, they gave me a strange glare when i asked if i could listen to school of rock while they 'operate'.  charles e. monoture is a gimpo, and he's very shifty.... they like had this sanding thing to smooth out the bottoms of my teeth, and the friction made like smoke. so, basically, a shifty gimpo was setting my teeth alight to an extent.  and then they shove rolls of cotton into the little crevice beneath your tongue.... it's not a good thing to feel.  and then they have the goop in the containers you bite on that makes impressions of your teeth; they even try to make it child-friendly with a variety of flavors.  let's say i have an easily provoked gag reflex.:) --- although i will admit nothing too horrible happened, like actually puking.  the assistant lady (who cut my lip with her prodding tool) said that alot of people are sensitive like me.  hmm...tell it to the cheap seats.  hee.

i later walked home against my will... it turned out cool though.  workin' the quads.  :-)  i went to tennis, and then ate good food.  then i wrote a letter to Royette.  And now I am blogging.  Night games may be tonight.... but with our track record for the past two weeks, i seriously doubt it.

      Salutations-
  We arrived back from the childhood home (Minnesota) Royette-less.  This is very sad, seeing as she is the youngest in our family.  And she has never been away from home for more than a casual sleepover.  w00t.  She went with an uber-annoying friend who will go under the alias Rock n Roll.  So, Rock n Roll and Royette were friends back in the days of Minnesota, but they got re-acquainted at this graduation party we were at, and there were mixed feelings.  Rock n Roll is the kind to wear large baseball caps and Guess skirts at age 9.  A spicy pepper, indeed-- Rock n Roll's awesome brother and I had the pleasure at this graduation party to play Dance Dance Revolution on the actual big-mettalic-Japanese version of the game instead of the Playstation edition with the sliding pads.  Of course, Rock n Roll throws a psuedo-tantrum, or atleast the greatest tantrum that a 9-year old can put forth.  It's more like a whimper-and-escape-to-the-retreat-of-the-bounce-house-at-the-graduation-party kind of tantrum.  But you catch my drift.  Anyway, hopefully Royette will be fine.  She is one to adjust.  And I'm happy if she's happy.  Aww.

It's 10:11 AM as of now, and I am planning on buying Teacher's Pet sometime today.  At first I thought it looked dull, but when I saw it in the theatres, it rocked my face off.  The movie is of course based on the t.v. show of the same name, which was at times very bland.  but this movie is very wiity, and it made me laugh out loud.  Which is good--- and it has catchy musical numbers!!  Which is good also.  A word to the wise: go to Family Video with your report card and they give you free rentals for every A you have.  It's great... we are set until 11:59 P.M. June 30th.  

I'm either seeing 'Saved' or watching all three LOTR movies tonight; both options are intriguing.  Or night games.  Poo.

And that's all I have to say about that.

      Today was a very stay-in-grungy-clothes-and be-hermit-like-by-staying-indoors type of day, even though it was extremely nice weather.  althought tonight the neighbors are having a cookout in honor of us moving.  bless them.  i attempted to read 'dune', but it was so utterly boring that i failed.  although i did accomplish the first page.  i played snood, and got online among my diversions.  i also watched this discovery channel special about sri lankan monkeys.  it was so very entertaining to watch-- they raided a village lady's home, and took handfuls of flour and eggs and an entire cake!  and the tv info about it said: A tribe of monkeys in an abandoned Sri Lankan temple leads their pack in the form of gang criminals. 
It made me laugh hysterically.  It was all about their methods of life, and the chief elder and how they had like teeth-gnawing fights for leadership.  All primates are so cool.  And we have our prehensility.  And if that's not a word, it is now.  I also took part in a rousing round of Battleship with Royette.  Rousing round, indeed.  i most enjoy aliterations.  I don't have much more to say.  A new Monk is on tonight at 9.  I guess I'll post again post-cookout and Monk.

      that song is very coo--- weezer. Officially titled 'Undone--The Sweater Song'.  i usually don't like them, but that song is the shiz (hee).  Anyway, I went to barnes and noble and got dune, this required reading for new school.  if i had to apply a shape to the atmosphere brought forth by that book, it would have to be a very oblong rectangle.  i also listened to bowie(i really enjoy suffragatte city :D), and this awesome band introduced to me by royette.  it's very obscure-- they're norwegian, they're a jazz band, and they're known as Funky Butt. Yes, Funky Butt.  So this Norwegian jazz combo known as Funky Butt was very nice to listen to... good music.  we were going to buy the album, but we decided otherwise.  Later, we went to royette's softball game.  i talked to kimbo blaney which was nice.  and elise.  she's coo.  and royette got a hit, but the next girl got out.  poo.  there was a picnic hoo-hah afterwards, and the employers, alias royette's kickin' team, placed third in the league.  congrats, royette.  we came home and listened to 'jessie's girl', which i still cannot get out of my head. actually right now it's more like a combo that frequently switches bewteen Float On, the Sweater Song, and Jessie's Girl.  But it's pleasant.  We had a psuedo-kareoke party, and then listened to the Sweater Song.  and now, we play Cranium, the game of the gods. that was my discreet shout out to cate.  Yay.... and tomorrow is kid's day!

Today i did the taebo 8-minute workout.  it was taebo-tastic.  snaps for taebo.  hmm... i made strawberry alarm clock once again with royette, and i'm going to barnes and noble later to pick up some cool new books. and for those of you who are on 'the scene', i'll have you know that all communication with anna klarner has been terminated.  i don't give a w00t anymore.  she can be cranky and exaggerate to no end.  true friends stick it, yo.  she is now a wiped memory, a figment of the imagination.  gone from the slate, a stray piece of corn off the cob on my corn stalk of life.  so goodbye.  it was nice to know you for a while, but no longer.
 On Conan last night, there was the U.S. air guitar champion.  It was awesome.

      me and my posse are going to rule the school of cheering at royette's softball game tomorrow. and bombard the unbeknownst ump with rotten tomatoes for cursing my being.  but we'll have none of that.  my posse and me all think you're cranky.  

to continue.

today, i played alot of tennis, which was good. i swam alot, which was good. except when i swim my hair turns into a psuedo-flat-tangled-messy-mullet.  it's not pretty.  nonetheless, however, i really enjoy swimming.  then i ate good food.  then i talked to cate, who enjoys alaskan whitewater rafting, meryl streep, and debbie downer. hee. i then saw dodgeball with  urlLink kuehn  and tincher.  that may be one of the funniest movies that i have ever seen-- this year at least.  in fact, i am in the right mood to include a snippit.

(the Average Joes, a team from this rinky-dinky gym/club place just lost the regional qualifying dodgeball match against a Girl Scout troop. but at the trophy ceremony....)

Judge Person: I am sorry, but we can no longer declare Girl Scout Troop 117 the winners of this match.  It seems in the preliminary urine testing, one of your memebers, girls, was discovered with traces of 3 varieties of steroids, and even an extreme beaver tranquilizer.

(spot on the girl. she puts her hands in her face, and it shows her now hairy arms and mustache.)

Girls: Bernice!!  (Bernice crys into her hands)

It was hilarious.  I laughed forever.  And   urlLink Chuck Norris  even made a guest cameo as a judge in the championship.  it was a great movie.  it goes highly reccomended.... to those of you who are of the male sort. hee.

life is, well.... pretty good. :)

      Greetings.  we just played clue the card game, which is loads more fun than the real board version. 'i'm lovin' it'.  I have absolutely nothing planned for tomorrow: a good thing.  relaxation is one of the many joys of summer.  amen.  and i'm going to see the terminal with people who will actually go with me(that was meant with sarcasm.)-- my siblings. hee. :D
 
hmm. not much more to say.

      Oy.  urlLink t.A.T.u.  is still stuck in my head, but now it's a different song.  it is crazed.  this one (i.e. title) is about a lesbian love affair. go figure.  although i will give it props for being one of the most catchy songs i've ever heard-- and any song that can stay stuck in your head for more than 3 days deserves uber-props.  Amen.

      yo.  i figured out my posting title problem-- i had somehow unconsciously changed the title field marker in my settings.  go figure.

drove to mn yesterday, came back today.  we picked up royette and met with Oronie (new alias) and with this kid that i haven't seen in a long time. he was awesome.  he'll be named ipod-ie.  anyway... we were at dinner and this waitress keeps bringing him like endless lemonades, and Rock n Roll's brother says something like, 'Jesus, they just keep coming!'.  And then, at the exact same time without warning or any prior knowledge of the sort, Royina and I started doing like a fold-your-fingers-over-your-palms-and-sway-with-an-excessively-smiling-face type of dance.  It was the EXACT same thing.  and so, the 'keep it comin!' was born.  we still all think that it'll be the dancing sensation that'll sweep the nation.

some other kid won the usa today john lennon songwriting contest. bah.

i also had the pleasure of listening to t.a.t.u. they are so beyond lesbian-esque that it's entertaining.  hee. i especially  like 'not gonna get us', in their native russian tongue.  we listened to it on ipod-ie's ipod, hence his clever alias.  clever.  anyway, so t.a.t.u. is amusing, as was this whole weekend.  i really enjoy minnesota.  oh yes-- and we played a game of ultimate war with these like water pressure squirt guns in Oronie's pool.  they weren't super soakers or anything.... they're these pool water squirter things.... moot point.  it was very fun.  although i got beaten in the nasal area with an inner tube handle.  ouch.

-- it's being considered that i get an ipod.  :D  i think green would suit me, eh?  i'll have to check out my options.

      As you may have noticed, my post titles have been in a sort-of 'The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?'-type format (and that's an oddball play. i only used it for reference.).  It helps me to cover multiple topics. Yesterday, I made my long overdue stop at Barnes and Noble, and picked up some assigned reads that will actually be enjoyable.  Although I must say, now that I've read 7 more pages of 'Dune', I'm considering reconstructing it's formerly-charred-hectagonal-vertices (see post below).  I can live with it. To continue, I purchased 'A Walk Across America', about a man who decides to walk across America.  Hence the title.  I also bought 'Hiroshima', and 'Days of Grace', Arthur Ashe's memoir.  I wanted to pick up 'I Me Mine', and I even was interested in David Sedaris's new book, but I was limited to my purchases. 
I have gone swimming every day this week for atleast an hour.  Pruny-finger-mania.  And I thought I'd have more to say about the Endless Swim, but I don't.  Float on, y'all.

      I have been watching continuous coverage of Wimbledon all week.  Tennis is by far the best sport to watch on TV, and being in Britain makes it all the more entertaining.  I'm rooting for Roddick.  And Llayton Hewitt.  And Maria Sharipova.  But none of that probably matters to you anyway.  I live on. Again.  Yesterday, when they promoted the TV diddy this Sunday, 'Breakfast at Wimbledon'(I'm assuming just meaning uncommon very early coverage), they had a spot on strawberries and cream-- which I now have a visual passion for.  It even lead me to quote Samwise in the bit where he asks Frodo on Mount Doom if he remembers the taste of strawberries with cream from the Shire.  I am in a tizzy, seeing as we're going to London next summer.  Eee-gads.  I have such a passion for hating 'Dune', my assigned reading for s'cool(like the lunchbox), I can't take it.  If I had to assign a shape to this book, it would be a hectagon, first of all.  Seeing as hectagons has 7 vertices... 7-- the most boring, un-coral, and irrationally divided number ever.  And it's vertices would be oblonged and burned to a crisp by a flaming torch, to symbolize my utter passion to destroy it.  But I have to read it. All 489 pages, plus appendixes.  Once again, I will live on.  And life is nice, nonetheless. Bye :D

      Oy. That's the song in my head all day.  Yesterday it was 'Are You Gonna Be My Girl?'.  And the day before it was t.A.T.u. But now, Paul and Art have decided to ravage my brain with their catchy melodies.  I live on. We got prime-o seats at the Grand Ol' Opry for Norah Jones.  Heavens. I said much more in my original post, but cursed AOL logged me off--in a reinalistic fashion, nonetheless.  I'll post again tonight. 
And now I play tennis.  Goodbye.

      I am getting the new Wilco cd for my birthday, as well as the best of Bowie.  And my iPod mini!  Yay!  And Norah's now at the Grand Ole Opry. I just finished reading 'Tuesdays With Morrie', which i enjoyed very much.  By chance, today is also Tuesday.  I would highly reccomend it, but it's very emotional-- and somewhat inspirational.  Must-read, nonetheless. 
I plan to swim tonight.  And the list of films I want to see is multiplying exponentially.  Like an ant colony.  But these are films.  'Fahrenheit 9/11', 'Spidey', 'Saved!', and 'The Terminal' are the ones at the cinema now.  Free time is abundant, so I hope to see all those this week.

      Sup, goons.  I was trying to let debbie be recognized for a bit by not ruining her spotlight at the top of my blog.  but her time is up.  apologies to all.

 Today, we go to Door County.  Royina is with childhood home friend who has a cabin there.  It is toit.  I was going to rent 'Zoolander' for the ride up, but I would feel very unproductive to not utilize the drive as reading time.  So it's back to 'Dune' I go.  Or perhaps I'll finish Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Or Tuesdays With Morrie. Or Fahrenheit 451.  Or The Thief Lord. Or The Known World.  As you can see, I'm not one to finish literature. 
Moving on, I assume that we're going to go to Al Johnson's, the Swedish hut restaurant out on the tip of Door County.  I dislike it, but of course, I'm not the majority.  The hostesses wear Bavarian-esque dresses and clogs.  Kind of like Pippi Longstocking.  Except Pippi was a child who wore Scandanavian-like dresses.  These are real people.  I find it humorous, atleast.  And, what would a Bavarian-Scandanavian-Swedish-American hut restaurant be without Bavarian-Scandanavian-Swedish-American goats on it's grassy roof?  How very classique.  I have so seen people just watch the goats eat the grass--the epitomy of great entertainment.  Chomp that sod! Chomp that sod!  I'll have to blog tonight.

      hi-- today was nice.  solitary, and for the most part quiet, but nice.  i woke up and watched tv. and read. and ate a bagel. and then i swam. and read the 'must list' once again.  i got myself purdy, i watched more tv, i read more, i got a ham sandwich, and i took a nap while i was watching 'finding nemo'.  then we drove for quite a long time looking for a car wash.  then pizza at the mellow mushroom.  then we saw 'king arthur', which was somewhat enjoyable; i suppose i just wasn't quite in the mood for a movie of that sort.  it seemed more like a see-shrek 2-again-type of night.  but nonetheless, i did like king arthur.  especially because merlin is a paegan. i am watching leno, and it's a lot better than i had categorized it to be.... seeing as i haven't seen it in a long time. i still prefer conan, but it'll do.  and i will admit he has good guests, too. I would like to take this moment to introduce to the world the name of my future band: Olmec.  more commonly seen as the oversized stone-puppet-announcer with kirk fogg on legends of the hidden temple, it will also serve as the name of my awesome four-member group.  and i am very excited.  oh, alright... i'm going to sleep soon.  and watching conan. and frankenstein just wasted a minute of my time.  bye bye...

      alright... i'm on a cot, it's 10:41, and parents are asleep in the other room.  so i'm just being my totally cool self--doing math homework, slathering on the chap stick, and reading the 'must list' for the n-th time.  nashville is beastly hot, but it's home. i will live on.  holy cats-- to my surprise, the laptop i'm on (dial-up) actually will play 'float on' for me.  i think i'll go grab my headphones............ on the way back here, i decided not to, seeing as i listen to my music head-bangingly loud even with headphones.  i'll just listen to it tomorrow in my day of solitude. Here.  Basically alone.  At the pool.  Or eating ham sandwiches.  as i look back on all of what i just wrote, it seems that it's mostly garbagio, and irrelevant.  but atleast i'm keeping myself preoccupied in my late-ish night awakeness.  so i'll continue with whatever ranting power i have left in me. tomorrow, as i plan to do every day here yet this week, it's  urlLink mellow mushroom  pizza for us.  it is such unbelievably good pizza that i may just have to purchase a t-shirt.  and if i recall, i've even discussed it in earlier entries.  and now, quite suddenly, i'm tired. goodnight.

      To begin, I just woke up from 10 and a half hours sleep.  A summer first for me.

secondly, a recap of yesterday.  i personally feel that the 4th of july is the quintessential summer day.  and for our famila, it was spent mostly indoors.  we did make a half-fledged effort to see fireworks by being one of those cars who stops on the side of the road to gaze longingly.  and before fireworks, we watched 'independence day' on tv, which, due to it's cheesiness beyond any extent ever, is now classified as the worst movie i've ever had to view.  we did, however, flip every once and a while to 'the music man'.  Up to par with 'west side story'.

I've accomplished 21 more pages of 'Dune'.


I recently bought a t-shirt that says 'you are what you eat'. and i am personally enjoying it very much.  but that had no relevance, so i'll go on.

Yesterday, while at Copps, I bought many a sorbet/frozen fruit/juice for smoothies today.  I also flipped through the EW's 'Must List', and (if I do not deceive myself, i think cate already told me this) debbie downer was No. 126.  It was proclaimed the funniest moment on television this year, and it even said that she'll be back next season.  god be praised.

I will be in Nashville all this week beginning tomorrow morning, but I think i'll have access to a computer.  so the fretting can decease.  Bye bye!

      Actually, it's late, so I'll just schmooze about it.  So I apologize for the title.  I really enjoyed it, actually.  And that seems to be all I feel like writing right now.  Seeing as it's 12:01, and I want to be up at 7:30 to watch Wimbledon.  Sharipova is a shinin' star, yo. Kristin Manske came over, and we had a rollicking good time with our psuedo-raindances.

Yea.... okay.&nbsp; Here's my scoop.&nbsp; I'm like playing piano, and just, like, online all day, and then my Mom says I should come with her to drop my sister off at the movies with her friend.&nbsp; And, seeing as I wasn't doing much else productive anyway, I came along.&nbsp; It turns out that she didn't go to the movie, she went to a surprise goodbye party.&nbsp; And it turns my friends were there too. :D&nbsp; So yea..... at Mike's house.&nbsp; With Jorken, and Ryan, and Giguere, and Matt, and Matt, and Viggo (hee).&nbsp; Yes.... we played volleyball (sort of.&nbsp; I'm don't have the leathery skin to withstand the pain-filled volleyball sting against my arms.&nbsp; Burn, yo.), and then we swam.&nbsp; Which was cool.&nbsp; And then we had really, really, really good hamburgers.&nbsp; Like, in my top 10 list of hamburgers.&nbsp; And that says alot, seeing as I have a passion for red meat.... and that&nbsp;sounded&nbsp;kind of gross.&nbsp; To continue, I would like to say 'thank you' to mike, and austin, and nick for throwing us this bash.&nbsp; It was awesome. :)&nbsp; Ahhh--- and we made a failed attempt to play Texas Hold 'Em, but yea.... we failed.&nbsp; And we had to leave for 'Anchorman'.&nbsp; Which was pretty darn funny..... there was this hilarious part where all the news crews like has a West-Side-Story-esque street fight in an alleyway, and I cracked up.&nbsp; Hahaha..... and they had these deranged weapons, i.e. a bedpost, a decked-out sword, and a grenade.&nbsp; And then there was this random guy who just ran through the scene alit in fire. It was very funny.... and there were extremely cool cameos.... Jack Black was this motorcycle guy. And then all of the news crews' leaders were well-knowners-- Vince Vaughn, (someone else I cant remember), and Ben Stiller, who was the head of the bilingual news channel gang.&nbsp; Hee.&nbsp; Anyway.... it was really funny.&nbsp; And although that was the most notable scene, Will Ferrell so rocked.&nbsp; He's hilarious in everything.&nbsp; Hahaha... especially the Blue Oyster Cult skit on SNL.&nbsp; 'WE NEED MORE COWBELL!' All in all, it was very, very fun.&nbsp; And as the single digits countdown begins, I'm glad to say life is good. :D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I went to Barnes and Noble for a really, really long time today.  And I previewed music for the entire time.... and created an amazon.com wishlist, derived from that very visit.  I have..... ten cds, and two books. And, of course, my soon-to-be-mine green iPod Mini.  Yay.... getting new music always brightens my spirits.  Not that my spirits aren't bright lately, but nonetheless.  Its... uber-enjoyable, how about?  And included are Randy Newman, Bowie(and I can't get 'suffragette city' out of my head.), Wilco, Counting Crows, Jamie Cullum (who is so incredibly awesome), The Dead, Jet (who is also so incredibly awesome), Lennon, and the I Am Sam soundtrack.  Actually, I have I Am Sam somewhere, but I misplaced it.  Ahg. Look out for Part Two of my A2Z soon.

      This may be one of the longest periods of time I've gone without blogging.  Which proves that my obession with blogger has increased.  Although I'm told that LiveJournal is more efficient.I saw 'Spiderman 2' for the second time on Sunday night.  It was...... interesting.  And I was in an extremely good mood for the majority of Sunday-into-Monday night.  
 Hahaha... I'm kind of pulled a weasel today-- I rented 'Dune' from Blockbuster to assist me.  I plan to still read the book, but, according to how detailed the movie is, I won't take in everything as 'deep' as before.  It's a two-disc DVD that's approx. four and a half hours long, so I plan to watch it in bits.  And hopefully that should do. 
 I Love The 90s  is so incredibly awesome.  I've only seen '91 as of now, but in 53 seconds, 91-93 are on.  I'll return. I move in less than two weeks.  That's weird.

       Ahh.... hello.&nbsp; I've had a lack of internet access due to the computers being packed early.&nbsp; Luckily enough, I'm on my dad's laptop, which I so cunningly snatched in these late hours, and plugged in myself in my room, into the phone line that has never been used.&nbsp; And, in my room right now, there is nothing besides a mattress, and my stomach is literally being pressed toward the desk because I squeezed in betwix the boxes.&nbsp; It's crazed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was attempting to be resourceful by asking to go to the library to get on the internet there, but that never happened.&nbsp; Anyway, I have this extremely large handheld TV on the desk here next to me (and it's way too large--- circa 1996 or so.) with Conan.&nbsp; So I have made do.&nbsp; Heh.    ....This is our last night here at our house.&nbsp; For two nights, we're at the Tundra Lodge with our suitcases, and then we're going to Door County for two nights, and we're pulling out on Tuesday morning.&nbsp; It's finally approaching.... ahhh.  Alright.... so this week, I've been sociable  every  night, which is an improvement for me.&nbsp; Monday, I saw Fahrenheit 9/11, Tuesday I saw Joseph, Wednesday I got to see Mike, and tonight we went bowling, played poker, and pool.&nbsp; And ate Hungry Howie's.&nbsp; And escaped from basement windows, from which we sprung into the street to run barefoot, like Kenyans.&nbsp; And then Kirstein came over.&nbsp; And we had a good time.&nbsp; Yes.  I hopefully will be able to get on at the hotel.&nbsp; If all goes well....... But, this will be the last time I post from home.&nbsp; So, this is goodbye.&nbsp; From my house.&nbsp; As you may expect, there will be a series of goodbyes from these last few locations where we are.&nbsp; So goodbye.&nbsp; From home.... :)

       I was going to discuss joseph, but i don't really feel like it now.&nbsp; It was good, though.
  Conan's guests are somewhat better tomorrow.... Benjamin Bratt, and Issac Mizrahi (hah.)&nbsp; And huge props to Conan for booking Modest Mouse.&nbsp; Hooray.
&nbsp;
*Yawn*.&nbsp; I'll write tomorrow.

       Is this post red? 
  .... My room is officially begun to be packed.&nbsp; Barren it is.&nbsp; But I jammed a suitcase of stuff to preoccupy me for the week.&nbsp; So all is well.&nbsp; I played tennis today, and I'm going to Joseph at St. Norberts!&nbsp; And I'm expecting a top-notch production.&nbsp; Hee.&nbsp; I'll discuss it later tonight.

       To 'start with a bang', I would like to note that  Fahrenheit 9/11  is the best movie I've seen this year, and has now also acquired a spot as one of my favorite movies.&nbsp; First of all, it was uncannily hilarious.&nbsp; There was this portion where a senator confessed that most congressmen don't even read the bills they sign, which was the case for the Patriot Act (mentioned in the flim. yes, flim.)&nbsp; Anyway, so Michael Moore hitches a ride on an ice cream truck with a loud speaker, and he drives around Capitol Hill reading the Patriot Act over the speaker.&nbsp; And he scared people away.&nbsp; Hee.&nbsp; Besides just being endlessly funny at some points, it was also very saddening/dramatic, as well as thought-provoking.&nbsp; And I liked the fact that it was presented in a very sarcastic way.&nbsp; I've always liked documentaries.&nbsp; Yea.&nbsp; I would  definitely  reccomend it, but there are some extremely, extremely graphic bits of wounded Iraqis.&nbsp; But it's not that long.... just for about 2 minutes of the whole movie do they have anything worth making it rated R.&nbsp; By far, the best movie I've seen in a very, very long time.  Afterwards, we went to Ryan's house.&nbsp; And went 'hot-tubbing.'&nbsp; Hee.&nbsp; It was really hot, hence it being a hot tub.&nbsp; And we played pool, which Jorken and I lost in.&nbsp; But only by the 8-ball.&nbsp; It was a showdown, in a sense.&nbsp; Yea.... so John Mayer is rocking the house on Jay, and Quentin Tarentino (a.k.a. the oddest duck around) is on Conan.&nbsp; And I have to wake up early to pack, according to Mom.&nbsp; Hah!&nbsp; And I may go bowling tomorrow.&nbsp; One of my many crammed social events in this last bit of time here.&nbsp; Eeesh... 6 days now. es muy sad.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Conan now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bye bye.

      No one's on anymore.  Jorken went into his hermit-like invisble mode, and everyone else left.  I will too. I will have you know that I have had a bit of fun, free of boredom, adding to my Amazon WishList.  It's so nifty.  And due to packed things already, my room is half-empty........Or half full?  Like the milk.  Skim rocks the house.  And I don't care what anyone says. (hint: diana.) even though you're gone.  yea.  you can see the extent of my boredom--my biased thoughts on milk. One week, to the day, and we leave. :(

       And so it begins.....&nbsp; I began to 'rip down' my room today, like alotting things to go to our apartment, or go into storage for a bit.&nbsp; Then there are my cupboards, which literally overflow with papers and trinkets and such when I open them.&nbsp; Heh.... and for those of you who went to LMS, I"ll have you know that I found a copy of the Disco Knights script, part of my play costume from last year, and the sheet music from when I played with the Show Choir.&nbsp; It was crazed.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; And I have to pack stuff for all week while it's all&nbsp;being taken, so I have to do that later as well.&nbsp; The movers officially come tomorrow, but we are 'getting prepared'.&nbsp; Ahg.  Tonight, though, Kirstein is coming over.&nbsp; And we're getting Chinese food, and watching  Big Fish .&nbsp; So I'm looking foward to that...... :D  Talk to you later.

      Sheesh.... this is really irksome.  SNL was really dry (except for one skit about Jessica Simpson's Chicken of the Sea bit), no one (besides Jorken) is online, and we're leaving in a week now.  And I don't have much else to say.


I did, however, watch every year of  I Love the 90s .  So I'm not entirely gloomy.

        Hello.... Nashvile is home now.&nbsp; Officially. For good.&nbsp; For all eternity.&nbsp; For serious.&nbsp; Before we left to drive down here, my mom got me  a ghost is born  (Wilco), and it is  now  one of my favorite CDs.&nbsp; I would also like to give Gracias-es to Kirstein, who gave my sister a mix CD, which I claimed as my own.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it is also a very, very good CD.... I have been re-introuduced to Ben Harper, gotten well-acquainted with 'Free Bird', had a helping of Van Halen, and even craved my yearning for more pschydellic pop, i.e. 'Stairway to Heaven', one of the coolest songs ever.&nbsp; Especially the part where it (quote) 'Oooooooh.... it makes me wonder'.&nbsp; Anyway..... the drive was very very good.&nbsp; My music so preoccupied me for fourteen hours, that it didn't seem long a'tall.&nbsp; I especially would like to again note the very-goodness of   a ghost is born . &nbsp; 'Spiders (Kidsmoke)' is just so insane and out-of-whack enough to make me enjoy it to no end.&nbsp; Heh.... it's 10+ minutes long, has incessant but very catchy lyrics, and has the screechiest, strangest, and definitely one of the coolest guitar solos I've ever heard.&nbsp; Hence me giving it an A grade.&nbsp; Congrats.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it goes like back and forth from like techno to rock.&nbsp; It's awesome.&nbsp; My point is that you should all buy/download/hack it from the library, or by whatever other means you get your music from.     We stopped in South Bend to visit my uncle and my aunt, both who teach at Notre Dame (University).&nbsp; It was very, very cool.&nbsp; And, after my oh-so-tiring stint of car-sitting, I'm tired.... for those of you who can't recognize it (I know a nameless few.), that was sarcasm.&nbsp; Hee.&nbsp; Talk to y'all later--  I live in Nashville now....cripes.&nbsp; :D

        Random things.  
    
  Yea. I bought an iPod if anyone cares.  It, according to FedEx tracking, left the shipping ramp in Shanghai last night at 8:32.  I am caught in the anticipation, and it comes with a nifty belt clip, so I'm set.  I want to get a glow-in-the-dark iSkin, but it is ridiculously overpriced.  So I'm holding off.  
    
  'Dune', again, if anyone cares, is divided into three books.  And, after month(s) of not exactly enjoying this book, I have finished the first portion; it's getting good all of a sudden.  Which is a supreme oddity--this  was  the most boring book I've ever had to read.  It's very much not so now.  So that's good.  
    
  I tried to learn the dance to 'Thriller' yesterday, and, much to my dismay, found I could not.  As some of you know (::choke/cough::Princakes (?) and Anna--Klarner.::choke/cough::), I have no coordination whatsoever when it comes to dancing, so I didn't put up much hope anyway.  The best effort I could put forth was to buy Thriller on iTunes.   
    
  Tomorrow I get my library card, and I go on a picnic, in a park that has a staircase up a hill for no apparent reason.  But I'm very excited for both.  
    
  ....t.A.T.u. should get some more credit.  'All the Things She Said' is pretty darn good.  And extremely catchy.  And they're Russian.  Which adds to the already odd/intriguing package.  

  AND MY BIRTHDAY IS ON SUNDAY.  So I'll give props to myself.  Props, props.  
    
  Yea.

     7. Describe what you want to be: 'Piano Man'- Billy Joel  
     8. Describe how you live: 'Long, Long, Long'-George Harrison  
     9. Share a few words of wisdom: 'Everything's Not Lost'-Coldplay/'It's A Privilege To Pee'-Urinetown.     Nobody is/was on tonight, so I'm going to bed.  G'night, y'all.

        I've subtly been notified that nobody likes my yellow-font-on-a-white-background.  Even if I may be color blind.  So I changed it to orange, or some other dark-ish color that I can't quite identify.  I hate, hate color blindness. Sometimes.  We're unpacked.  And I'm liking our cramped quarters, actually.  It's cozy, to an extent.  And I even get the second computer in my room, ala high-speed connection.  Fo shizzle.  Seinfeld is awesome.  School begins in approx. 3 weeks, and in that time, I must-- a)finish the 400+ pages of  Dune  I have left to read.  Although I've tried to write out a long-termy plan to read 40 pages a day, thus finishing it in roughly ten days.  Who knows?  b)Write a paper about it.  c) Read yet another book.  It's only 150 pages or so, but it doesn't really tickle my literary fancy quite like my own choice readings.  And d) Take/re-take scribbly notes in the all three books, to prove that I actually read the whole lot.  Jaysus.  That is all.  Bye bye.

      The Legend of Ron Burgundy has been seen.&nbsp; Will Farrell has acted, cameos have occurred. In the end, it all came together.  &nbsp;  Roy (hah, fix)&nbsp;and me went to see Anchorman. Ron and me laughed.  &nbsp;  The movie was more a somewhat entertaining story then a fullout comedy. It was still a very good movie and if I had one, my hat would be off to the actors. Will Farrell's movie career has started off with a bang and it continues to move full speed ahead.  &nbsp;  JorKen's ranking:&nbsp;3 out of 5  &nbsp;  A very nice movie, a little over-hyped, but still very much worth seeing.

      Today (yesterday?) I saw Spiderman 2. Worth the 8 bucks? Nope.  Few good things can be said about this movie. The effects were better then expected, and the plot managed to make sense. The surprising thing about this movie, was the fact that it was still better then the first.    JorKens ranking: 2 out of 5  Lacked in many areas, but still managed to entertain.

      Roy came to me with the idea for a multiblog. Ideas like that come around once every few months or so. Naturally, I jumped in. Soon it will be a great time for my lack of writing skill to truly shine! score!    This is going to be interesting.

      Yay! My ambition came true. Props to  urlLink JorKen , the other member of this blog as of now.  Anyway, this is our multi-member blog, like it or not. Even though there won't be many people reading it to have that strong of an opinion, anyway.  Nonetheless, here we go.  I originally thought this would be a blog to like record school life, but we can change that to 'school life and such'.  So I'll post again when the such part is developed.   This blog is oddly giving me great joy. :D   Cheers.

      See, I'd give Fahrenheit 9/11 more of a 4.75-sort-of ranking.  And this is to prove that Jorken has not taken over our group blog, as he so thinks he has.  Heh. I plan to write more when school begins.  Yea.  Haha.... Bush is being ridiculed again... on Conan. Props to Kerry.  Besides his wife.  Although you've gotta love the ketchup.

      Yes, continuing on our movie binge, me and Roy saw Fahrenheit 9/11.  Was the movie an attack at Bush? Yes. Was it good? Yes.  &nbsp;  You may be thinking, hey, don't documentaries suck? No,no they don't.  Some call Michael Moore an oddball, sure, it works. I still liked the movie.  &nbsp;  The movie talked about 9/11, the Bush family's connections, and the war. There really isn't much else to say about it. It was a comedy, a drama, and a horror all at the same time. Im not just complimenting this movie because I wanted Gore to win, I think its a great flick.  &nbsp;  There was a line in the movie, Bush says to Michael Moore "Hah, get some real work(job)"  Moral of the story? Don't fuck with a movie director. Hah.   JorKen's ranking:&nbsp;3.5 out of 5   3 points because of the movies greatness.  .5 because they made fun of Fox&nbsp;Broadcasting &nbsp;

       JorKen.... has been grounded :(     &nbsp;   Yes, it is as depressing as it sounds..... I am not going to be online for a while. Maybe, just MAYBE I will get on stealthily for a few minutes at a time.     &nbsp;   Fear not, is it just the computer, JorKen shall be around as usual, hopefully.   &nbsp;  Just to inform you all,  All Quiet on the Western Front , sucks. No,&nbsp;it single handedly ruined my afternoon, it was that bad.  &nbsp;

       I broke the ice, if you will.  There was quite a prolonged silence.... (hem hem-- Jorken. hee.  only kidding.)  Right now, I'm watching 'Hell Freezes Over' on tape, and it's awesome.  Although until recently, Henley hasn't really done anything except play maracas, and pull a few Garfunkels by just sitting on a bench and singing.   Kind of bland.  But they're doing 'Life in the Fast Lane' right now, so he's playing drums.  Don't fret.  And then there's this one unidentifed guy playing all the cool guitar solos, that I, nor my dad for that matter, can put a name to.  But other than that, it's very cool.   Timothy B. Schmitt with his whacked out  urlLink girly-man hair  (shout-out to Ahhnold.), and his old-school clothing.  And for those of you who are immune to superb California-country-70s-rock, this is the Eagles.    Once again, this blog will be much more exciting when school starts, I presume.  Seeing as that was my original intention for this with JorKen-- a school-oriented blog.  Anyway, cheers to your health.   And Jorken rocks.  :D
