        Ai carte, ai parte    Maybe thrice in a thousand does permanence appear consistent to the sentient being, destined by God in all his power and logic, for the rest of the time there is a large gap of misinterpretation between Him and his subjects, who are created in his likeness to the very atom. Is He blind, or simply deluded?  Does knowledge give power, or is fallacy the only destination? The application of garbage is deeper than it seems. If a hand is outstretched, is the possibility of it being hit any larger than when it is withdrawn? Though the answer to this may seem arcane, foreign, to the mind of the animate, is it so with those who have died? Is death even the end?  Maybe the gobbledygook of the pious shall elucidate the eventual root.  “My dear people, we are already the children of God but what we are to be in the future has not yet been revealed; all we know is, that we shall be like him because we shall see him as he really is.”   Of the New Testament, John   Does he mean that we, the human race, will eventually evolve into Him or does he simply mean we will become him upon death, a final unity and conclusion? Does it really matter? Our lives, they are both static and ever flowing. Does anything past today matter? Before?  “That is not which is. The only Word is Silence. The only Meaning of that Word is not. Thoughts are false. Fatherhood is unity disguised as duality. Peace implies war. Power implies war. Harmony implies war. Victory implies war. Glory implies war. Foundation implies war. Alas! for the Kingdom wherein all these are at war.”   Of the Book of Lies  ,  Aleister Crowley

         The League of Extraordinary Losers    One day, Stephen Norrington, the director of  urlLink Blade , woke up, and said to himself “I shall direct the crappiest movie ever made!” And he pretty much succeeded, but I’m getting ahead of myself here.  The movie was to be called  urlLink The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  and it would only have a semi-alright story because it was loosely based off a comic book.  He started his dream by going to Trevor Albert, the producer of  urlLink Bedazzled , and asking him for some dough.  Albert replied by giving him a wad of cash, and telling him “Do what thou wisheth with yonder money!”  And when Norrington counted it, he had an epiphany. “But Trevor, this will leave us only a $100 dollars for use on actors, special effects, advertising, and etc!”  “But what the fucketh art thou going to useth the rest of the money for?”  “The rest is to pay for  urlLink Sean Connery  to act as the lead role!”  “Ah!” replied Trevor Albert. “ urlLink The Best Bond in the world …”  “Yes, it’s the only way people would ever watch this crap film I’m about to make…”  Trevor nodded understandingly. “Yes, well… I just can’t throw my money everywhere now can I? That $100 will have to do!” And Trevor fucked off.  And yet, it should have ended there for Stephen Norrington’s dream, but fuck, it didn’t. Norrington was a determined man, and he hired a horde of crappy animators (which he obviously imported from Latvia) and actors to star in the movie.  Actors such as Stuart Townsend ( urlLink Queen of the Damned ) and Peta Wilson (Who’s career, although not strong to begin with, appears to have died alongside the movie) for example.  Anyway, he managed to make the movie, which bombed so badly it made Hiroshima look like a fucking playground.  The point of the above post? None really, I just felt like writing something in addition to the subsequent evaluation of the  urlLink Sony Ericsson K700i .      The K700i    You see, for the past two weeks, I have been worrying about two things. Firstly, my net has become slower, therefore disallowing me from speedily downloading various forms of entertainment (not all of it dirty). Secondly, I have been trying to decide what my next mobile phone purchase should be. I had the choice between that Nokia mobile phone with the QWERTY keyboard, and the K700i from Ericsson.  I chose right.  Let me tell you why. The K700i is, first off, designed like an Aston Martin. Beautiful exterior (a few annoyances with this explained later on), and a powerful interior. I mean shit; I thought the world of mobiles had gone to the metrosexuals and female teens obsessed with colours that can cause epilepsy.  No, not the K700i!  It has a sophisticated silver finish, not too bright, not too dark. Its back even features a brushed aluminium finish! Oo and Ah with me! Have I mentioned the screen? It’s at a resolution of 176x220 (if I remember correct) and has around 65,500 colours. This thing has the most fucking ace screen I’ve ever seen.  I am not a joystick kind of person; I prefer buttons, which is why when I picked up the K700i I was a bit pissed to begin with, finding myself stumbling over and over again with it. But after around four hours of practice with the thing, I can now navigate with relative ease around everything, maybe stumbling once in thirty joystick presses. But this is to be expected, I’ve been a Nokia user for quite some time now, and the power I now hold exceeds anything Nokia has ever provided me.  Moving right along, the phone (battery included) weighs around 93 grams. This isn’t much, compared to  urlLink Nokia’s 7650  which is 154 grams, or  urlLink Nokia’s 6600  which weighs 125 grams. I was surprised at how little weight this thing has, since I expected a heavier bugger considering all the stuff that’s inside it, which is listed next.  - A camera capable of both image and video capturing. It has a 4x digital zoom. The quality of the pictures it takes currently surpasses most mobile phones on the market (I’m not versed enough in the mobile world to say it is the top mobile/camera). - 41 MB of space. You can load MP3 music from your computer onto your K700i and listen to it if you wish, or even use it as your ringtone!  - The games use Java, and though this may be a con to some, it means better graphics and such. The three games that come with the phone are all new to me, and fun to an agreeable extent (save the tennis game, which is making me feel like a bad gamer).  - A program called MusicDJ which allows you to create your own ringtones in the same way as the Apple program Itunes does. You choose a sound for the bass, the drums, keyboard, and accent (trumpets I think xD).  - Internet connectivity, this speaks for itself. You can download, if I am correct, new games and applications to your mobile rather than have to go through the computer. You can do that to through infrared, Bluetooth, or USB. You can even buy that Bluetooth remote control car and apparently use your mobile to control it… I think? xD  Anyway, Alec is bitching about me making another post, so I better stop here. But be warned, the phone supply on this phone is a bitch, and you will need to recharge it every day should you decide to buy it xD For me, this isn't half as big a deal as most people make it out to be, but hey, whatever suits you eh?  Selling Price? The best bargain would be US $249.99, but you will probably find it at around US $350.

      It is early morning in an excuse for a 'city' known as Canberra. The parliament house is open and the overpaid 'politicians' go to 'work'.  The rest of Australia gets up, takes a piss, says goodbye to their wives and travel to work, knowing that as long as someone else is the running of the country, they can still get shit faced at the end of the week.  The youth go to school, or smoke bongs, depending on Centerlink's unemployment benefits.  This seems to work, for the most part, but everyone knows at least a little bit about politics. Howard is Prime Minister, the Creen is the opposition leader. At least I think he is, it changes very often.  Bills are put forward, bills are rejected, bills are put forward again. Wash, rinse, repeat. Except when the following occurs.    Why the Australian Government is Stupid - Reason #1    Something funny happens. Someone crashed into a pair of buildings. Oops.  Johnny Howard is a bit worried. You see, he's in love with Bush. Bush puts out you see - god damn tiger in bed. Who can resist that accent? Anyway Bush wants little Johnny to come and help him.  'The peoples who attacks us, have big weapons, My Johnny - Will you pretty please come and kill them?' 'Sure thing maaaaate' 'You Aussies might die and shit' 'Whatever, I love you Bush, nothing can stand in the way of true love'  So people, despite the majority of the youth protesting in the city streets, watched as troops were sent out to do God knows what in the Middle East.  Why?  Because  they  had  weapons of mass destruction ! That's why. Now we can't bloody leave, it's not as if we can blow up shit and leave, you have to blow it up then walk around for a bit, you know, to make it official and whatnot.  Oh and how many W.O.M.D did we find again? Someone remind me, I forgot... (Zero isn't a hard number to remember... Oh right, irony, sorry- Dammo)    Why the Australian Government is Stupid - Reason #2    'We need more money John, whats a good way of doing that?'  "Heyyyy? Ah golly gosh, gee wizz poddle. Wait! I got it!"  'Whats that, Mr Prime Minister Sir?'  "Lets give universitites the ablitly to raise HECS fees for students by up to 30% to make up for the lack of government funding!"  'But Mr Howard Sir, won't that leave the poor people out?'  "No no no you fool, you see, we leave Nurse courses and shit out, cause we need more of them. That way, the rich kids will become docters, the poor ones nurses!"      'That's a bit biased. Won't that piss students off?'  "I'm used to that by now,  silly"     Why the Australian Government is Stupid -Reason #3     Medicare Telvision Ads  Sure they are funny when people take the piss out of them, but doesn't mean to put more of them on. It was estimated that Johnny spent 16 million dollers on advertising alone.  You know it makes sense. (And this is why Australia never moves forward, because of lazy bastards like Alec xD- Dammo)

       Because Alec is a lazy whore (I say that a lot), I’ve decided to give the gentlemen (and some of the more open minded ladies) my choices for the  Top Five Hottest Celebrity Babes ! Not ten because I’m lazy (and picky).  Now, this is how it will work, I will post the pictures, and you will look at the pictures. Simple? Yes. I also give some brief reasons for my choice.  So gentlemen, on with the show?     #5- Elizabeth Hurley           Alright, she is spectacular, but she’s old now, and that really reduces her marks. And the fact she’s only on the list is because of two things.  A) She was sizzling in Bedazzled. B) She was married to Hugh Grant (*insert swoon here*)    #4- Rachel Leigh Cook       Her name speaks for herself. As does her amazing looks. She is the equivalent to Keira Knightley for me and Fudge back in 2002.    #3- Monica Bellucci       How can you not agree? She may be getting older, as everybody does, but damn she is hot xD    #2- Tyra Banks       Do you not hear the cheers from MEN all around the world when you say her name? TYRA TYRA TYRA.    #1- Keira Knightley       And coming in at numero uno,  KEIRAAAAAAAA KNIGHTLEEEEEEY . Damn, she’s hot as both a blonde and a brunette, and it’s rare that I find blondes hot at all xD So she well deserves holding the definitive title of    HOTTEST CELEBRITY BABE       Now, I must start my English homework, peace out,   YOU STUPID BASTARD

      “Neooooooo, wake up…”  The One they called Neo ( get it? The One? ) rubbed the shit from his eyes, and saw more shit when he opened them. He screamed.  “What’s wrong Neo?” The she-male Trinity caressed her hand, which had hairy palms by the way, over Neo’s face.  In the darkness of Neo’s mind, he realised that he must have been pretty wasted the night before to have found Trinity even remotely sexy, I mean, honestly. He screamed again for good measure. Then he ran, not bothering with that slow-motion bollocks.  As he ran, Trinity fell into tears. To the cabin, she proclaimed her sadness. “Why? Why does he always run off screaming in the morning when at night he screams in passion as I do that thing with my ____? ( insert your own sick fetish in the space provided )” More tears, boo fucking ho. -----  Minutes later, Neo had already forgotten what had happened, and was eating cereal outside, fruity loops in fact ( ooo, foreshadowing ). As he robotically separated the red rings from the green rings, the guy with the bald head, and who held no real role after the first Matrix, came in.  “Neo, the Oracle wishes to see you.”  “…”  “Neo?”  “…”  “Neo, is there something wrong?” Morpheus looked at Neo, examining him.  Neo screamed ( this makes a total of three screams so far! ).  “Neo! What’s wrong?!”  “This fucking spoon won’t bend!” DRUM ROLL PLEASE. -----  Behold the magnificence of the lazy writer and his use of Deus ex Machina.  Neo took a seat on a green bench in the park.  He was immediately hit by five pieces of bird shit, and not even he could dodge those suckers.  A moment later, the Oracle came hobbling over, with her sex slave Seraph.  “Neo, how are you?”  Neo stopped cleaning the bird shit off of his gay arse trench coat. “I am… fine… You?”  “Only you know the answer to that.”  “… How do I know the answer to that which is not under my control?”  “Only you know the answer to that.”  “… How can I find the answer to knowing that which is not under my control which in turn I must know to find out how you are?”  “Only you know the answer to that.”  Neo attacked the Oracle, effectively killing the old bitch, which was paid so little in the movie she quit so the Wachowski Brothers were forced to use the one line she did record repeatedly. Don’t you just wish that happened in the movie?  The Seraph cried tears of joy. “Thank you Neo, she made me do horrible things…” He shivered. “I don’t think I’ll ever forget the sight of her hairy ____ ( Insert body part here ) or her saggy breasts…”  Neo killed Seraph with a single blow. Those mental images would never be erased from his mind.  Then Smith came and Neo killed him too, thereby cutting off any reason to make another sequel and also saving his own life.  He then proceeded to fuck Smith's dead body for no good reason.  ( See? Those fruit loops did make sense after all ) ----   9 out of 10 Sane Men Agree This Matrix Fan-Fic is the Fan-Fic to Be

      Because Alec is a lazy fuck,  (I take offence to that, cunt xD - Alec)  this article doesn’t have the Sean Connery praise it should xD But hey, read on anyway.  Men everywhere look up to James Bond as an idol. More importantly, however, they look up to Sean Connery AS James Bond as an idol. Now bona fide men (not the sherry sipping, cane twirling, metrosexuals women call men these days, take  urlLink Gackt  for example) rejoiced when they heard Pierce Brosnan was finally giving up the seat of glory. Then they hit themselves in their genitals, because it was yet another blow to manhood, when it was announced that Eric Bana was the most likely candidate to be the new James Bond. I mean honestly, it’s not that he isn’t a decent actor, he’s just not Bond.  So, without further ado, I bring to you the candidates for the new James Bond. -----    Candidate Number 1:  Sean Connery    What? Did I just make a blunder? FUCK NO, DAMMO BLUNDERS NOT.  (Bullshit, you did once, and I corrected you - YOU LIE! -Alec)  After talking with a friend of mine I decided that the most fitting substitute for Sean Connery would be Sean Connery. And yes, I know he’s not getting any younger, but that could be the new Bond edge we’re looking for! Picture this…  ----- The wheels sped down the road; Bond was being chased yet again.  In that thick sexy accent of his, he said “I crapped me pants, AI!”  He put his hands to the brakes, and the vehicle came to a sliding halt. Slowly, Bond reached into his super chic jacket, and removed his latest Q invention.  The inhaler.  “Breathe in Booond, Breate out Boooond” The spy told himself.  He slowly removed himself from his Aston Martin wheelchair, and turned to face his pursuer.  “Ach, ye have a fine set of wheels, ye do!”  The woman got out, yer breasts reaching her toes as she did. Her Italian accent was cracked. “Ferrari…” She hobbled over to the man with the golden gun. “Should we go for a martini? Shakeeeeen, not stiiiiirrrrrred?”  Before Bond could say “AYE!” a voice from his jacket, that of Q, said “Remember Bond, no more martinis.” Before Bond could ask, Q’s voice came back. “And remember, if you’re going to have sex with her, you must, and I stress MUST, take your medication five hours before the Viagra. Q out.” -----     Alright, so that would only appeal to people with Old People Fetishes, but it’s the best I could think of without the use of a time machine. And the best I can do at 12 at night. -----    Candidate Number 2: Bruce Willis    Now, I know what you’re thinking, he’s not English, he’s American. But DAMN, there are few men who can be the tough guy and still be charming. Ever seen Hudson Hawk? Fabulous movie, despite bombing in the box office, but then again, LOTR did well in the box office. So I don’t have very much trust for “the system”. ANYWAY, if you gave Bruce Willis an English accent, and put him in a suit, he’d be perfect for the part. Sure he’s getting old, but he’s still not THAT old. -----    Candidate Number 3: Steve Irwin    No, sorry, I just couldn’t help myself xD But the stupidity in selecting ol Irwin is just as high as selecting Bana boy. They’re both prisoners of Mother England.  (Have a go at this! *shoots laser* - Alec)  -----    Candidate Number 4: Bruce Campbell    Bruce Campbell would be an amazing choice if it wasn’t for the fact that he’s generally a B-rated actor, with the exception of his work in Army of Darkness. He’s one of the few people men will admit was The Man at some point or the other. As opposed to Sean Connery who still is. -----    Candidate Number 5: Dammo    That says it all really.    (You can't be Bond AND Prime Minister of Australia - Make up your bloody mind -Alec) [I take offence- Dammo]  -----  Feel free to vote. And remember this classic moment from Monty Python’s  Life of Brian .   Brian: You are all individuals! Crowd: Yes! Yes, we are all individuals! Lone voice in crowd: I’m not Person next to him: Shh!   The moral of that situation? Err, vote me you cunts.    Link of the Moment  :  urlLink The Truth About George , the 43rd President of the USA. My favoured Bushisms  are    "And out of the evil done to America is going to come a more peaceful world, and a more better America..."   I mean honestly, what a tart xD  (Agreed -Alec)    "What is your ambitions?"   Too not learn English and become president of the USA. I mean even Microsoft Word recognises that error.   "I'm honored to shake the hand of a brave Iraqi citizen who had his hand cut off by Saddam Hussein."   … Right, I don’t know what to make of this one.   "We want results in every single classroom so that one single child is left behind."   Ah well, want more, go to the aforementioned site.

      Bah, I noticed the google ads had Doom 3 on them, so I wanted to see if any cool porno links would come up xD  This should make it Dammo's turn to post, as long as the word 'homosexual' isn't ridden throughout it ( funnily enough i've been working on the Heterosexual male commandments- Dammo ), then the google ads should be fine.  Oh, this is a blog, that's right. Today I played DDR for two hours straight ( ... You sick fuck-Dammo ) , and I'm buggered.  Hmm, note to self, post when I have energy.

       Doom 3, to Hell and Back.   Well Dammo went with a game preview, so I will too.  Ever wanted to stay up all night, scared shitless, wondering what the hell is outside waiting for you?  No neither have I, but that's not the point.  The point is that Doom 3 has set the new standerd for FPS games. Besides ID Software creating the bloody catagory in the first place, ID are known for releasing rock solid game engines which define the gaming industry.  Anyone who is anyone has played the original Doom. If someone told me they have never played it before, I wouldn't hesitate in punching them in the face right on the spot. Who can forget the crappy MIDI music, the growling as you walk down a lonley corridor, or blasting the shit out of a monster at point blank range with the beloved shotgun?  The next installment of the Doom series is nothing short of an visual experience. Nvidia have pumped out thier 6800 ultra that supports engines for Doom 3 for christ's sake. You know it must be good.  And it couldn't come soon enough. ID software have put a lot of time and effort, with development starting right after Quake 3 was released. Level design looks nothing short of amazing. Shadows are catsed on models themselves, with distinct realism never seen before. Animation is fluid and flows together perfectly and gameplay was designed to be done alone in the dark...  Of course, with detail comes lack of quantity, as there is no way, with the amount of detail in each model, that you can have too many models at one. This means that the shit load of monsters that Doom was known for, will not be as present. Small price to pay, but still.  You will want a damn good computer though. About 2.4 ghz with that beloved 6800 ultra and a shit load of RAM should do you. Pity I'm still on a Pentium 3 huh. (Fuck up Dammo xD)  So relive your childhood. Buy me a new computer, and let the walk to hell and back begin!    Source From: Me reading Hyper Magazine in the newsagent this afternoon.    Dammo's Notes: On those graphics, Alec neglects to mention that some of the graphics are still 2D. He also neglects to mention that Doom 3 is still shit compared to Far Cry, with only one advantage over it, and that's character models xD  Dammo's Notes by Alec: Also, I'm a smelly bitch who has to do a 10 minute presentation by tomorrow. This is because I am stupid. After giving shit about Alec doing the same, I have stupidly gone off and left it to the last minute. (You stupid cunt xD I just have to give in the papers, not actually do the presentation- Dammo)

      There comes a time on ones life where you just sit back and wonder 'why don't I go out and jump on some crocodiles?'  Well of course you do, it's a turning point and everyones life. You know you have grown up once you have thought about this.  Now although everyone thinks this, one man acted on it, and hence became an idol. A ambassader, if you will, to the rest of the world, that now represents a little speck of dust known as Australia.  His name, is Steve. Steve bloody Irwin.  Now don't get me wrong, great bloke, done a lot for the wildlife and whatnot. Sure he nearly got his kid eaten, but that little incident can be overlooked. I mean look at all the great stuff he's done. I've been to his zoo, and although I didn't see him, although the lines were ridiculously long and full of tourists, although the poor structure of his zoo outlines the rushed buildings and extensions put forward due to a sudden rise in fame, and although it is just a little bit on the expensive side, it's worth it to see crocodiles being raised away from their natural environment.  I mean seriously, who wouldn't want to be fed in front of a thousand visitors, cheering and taking photos of you? I sure wouldn't mind it. If I had a choice between living in a river, or living in a small pen being looked at all day even when I take a shit, I would take the latter in a second.  Onto the next point. Who the hell talks like Steeve bloody Irwin? Apparently, according to those oh so smart Americans, we all do. And why shouldn't one person represent the way in which a whole country? You know it makes sense. ( I can't imagine you people speaking otherwise- Dammo )  'Crikey! Look at this beauty!'  I got another idea, Steve darling. Shoot yourself in the head, or at least stop talking like a  over crazed orgasming pigmy.  'Have a go at this!'  How about no, friend.  Don't get me started on the movie. The only good thing coming out of that movie was the perve. And no, not on Steve's wife, the other chick. We know a lot of that film was in your park Steve, nice try buddy. The overly used sterotypes were second only to the terrible dialogue, and to top it all off - the ending was as good as my maths ability (which is honestly quite bad) [ Don't forget your English- Dammo ].  I guess you could say I'm not his biggest fan.

          urlLink Yoshi..  said...                    We're gonna be black??!!! Euhh... that's the last thing i want.. seeing my character as an ugly fat black dude in a game.. well, come on y cant rockstar let us to create our own character before we play.. so we can choose whether we want to be black.. chings.. white trash.. pakis.. italian.. or arabs. it gonna be more fun if rockstar can also allow us to choose our own sex.. whether we want to be a male, a female, or both :P.. it's gonna be cool to play as a sexy seductive dangerous blood-thirst chineese whore. :P (my fantasy)   -----       In response to  "We're gonna be black??!!! Euhh... that's the last thing i want.. seeing my character as an ugly fat black dude in a game"  As opposed to being a ugly, skinny, brown dude in real life? xD   In response to  "well, come on y cant rockstar let us to create our own character before we play.. so we can choose whether we want to be black.. chings.. white trash.. pakis.. italian.. or arabs"  Well they could do that, but it would make the voice acting and such harder. If you don't mind your character not talking, then sure, hey, why not make your own? But with GTA: VC Tommy Vercetti had a voice, and it was a sexy one. And don't even think about adding voices for all those races, it would be too hard. And it would take up even more space, space that I honestly don't think there is. (Note: GTA SA runs on a dual layered dvd disc, unlike it's elders)   In response to  "it gonna be more fun if rockstar can also allow us to choose our own sex.. whether we want to be a male, a female, or both :P"  Ummm, how would that lend to the gameplay? Pick a female and you can whore yourself perhaps? Or even as a man you could sell your body. And I'm not going to say ANYTHING about the both comment.  (I don't know, I think it would be kinda cool xD -Alec)    In response to  "it's gonna be cool to play as a sexy seductive dangerous blood-thirst chineese whore. :P (my fantasy)"  ... I can't give you that fantasy, but I can give you something pretty close. A Japanese (the country near China) review of female vampires (blood thirsty!) and the girl with the brown hair in the first pic doesn't look half bad.

         Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas      Designed By: Rockstar North    Instead of starting off with something totally silly and retarded (Which I’ll leave to Alec) I decided to do a game preview type thing. Anyway, let’s start, shall we?  The  Grand Theft Auto  series has pleased many a gamer with its freeform game play and general ability to knock whoever you liked off. This was what made it an appealing game, but it never really made it big with the mainstream. Maybe it was the crappy graphics, maybe it was that it was a little ahead for it’s time in terms of violence, but whatever it was, the game didn’t hit it big.  That is until  Grand Theft Auto 3  came out in 2001 for the PS2, and boy was it unexpected. It practically came out of the blue, and it shocked the pants off of gamers, because it allowed them to do even more devious acts. Not only could they steal cars and shoot the shit out of people, but they could also hire whores for ‘health benefits’. And all this in stunning 3D graphics! This game was, for the average male gamer, the equivalent of multiple orgasms to female.  Of course, parents took up their pickets and protested against the violence and shit, because that’s what parents do. And then the  GTA3  thing died down. Why? Because  GTA: Vice City  was coming out. They obviously didn’t want to make it look like they were remodelling the  GTA3  engine, so they made it look like an expansion pack. Anyway, this took place in the 80’s, and once again gamers pleasured themselves, but this time to Michael Jackson tunes (Alec pleasures himself to MJ tunes daily).  And then there comes  GTA4 . Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m looking forward to this game as much as the next nerd, but for Christ’s sakes, I feel like I’m going to be disappointed. Call it a sixth sense, but I feel like I’m looking at what will be an empty carcass of a game.  Let’s start off with something that really bugs me about this game. The size. It makes the bold statement of saying it will be three cities large and will be “somewhere between five and six times bigger than Vice City”. I find it hard to believe that the PS2 engine can handle this. Even with  Vice City , the machine seemed to have essential troubles keeping up with the flow of the game, and you’d sometimes see through roads etc. And with the enhanced graphics in  San Andreas , how the fuck can Rockstar even HOPE to keep the game running smoothly?   Now ok, let’s say they manage to pull the impossible off, there are concerns I have to do with the actual play engine. Let me start this paragraph off like a blunt cunt. I hate realism. I feel that gaming should let you do whatever the hell you like, whether it be racing through a forest as a blue hedgehog or stomping on mushrooms as an Italian plumber. With this said, I think the Weight and Exercise system in  San Andreas  is bollocks. The whole idea of you actually having to eat to not look like an Ethiopian bugs me. And the fact that if you eat too much and don’t exercise you’ll look like Anna Nicole Smith did a while ago. WHY BOTHER?  Finally, because I’m getting tired, the music. Since this game is set in the early 90’s, this means AC/DC, Ice Cube, and the Beach Boys. Now, don’t get me wrong, the Beach Boys is great, if you’re making a  Pee Wee Herman Driving Simulator  but otherwise I just can’t imagine myself killing people to that brand of music.

Leave your thoughts if you’d like.
