      I can't wait till school's over! haha     But yea.   People rock.  and so do chocolate chip cookies... but that's beside the point. :-)           It's so nice when you're not in the best of moods, and then just by chit-chattin with a few people you're bouncin off the walls.     I love that feeling.  Thank you Tweet, Roo, Bop, and Doc.  And for those of you that don't know... those are indeed real people. haha  Nicknames.  Can't get too personal on the internet; don't know who's out there.  lol           I finally got a template I like... and modified it to hell and back, so I think I've found the way this Blog will look.  At least for a while.  Well I gotta get some sleep, school tomorrow... blech.    Night all.  Currently Listening to: "Wish I Could Forget You" - Silverstein  _TB

      Well the parade went pretty well... it was a bit wet though.  The ceremony was held inside, so we didn't have to play there, and then the jazz gig was canceled.  Yay!  So yea. My day's not too shabby so far.  I feel like bein a bum, so here I am.  Sitting on my ass eating a bowl of Rice Chex... mmmmmm  I'm thinking about making up a website somewhere... probably geocities... and hosting a blog there instead of here, so I might just do that this summer.  Ah can't wait till school's out.  Well I'm outta here... it's so boring around here.   Grrr.  Currently Listening to: "Smashed into Pieces" - Silverstein  _TB

      Okay. Once again, another attempt at a Blog.  Let's see if I'll be lazy again or not.  Okay well there's not much to say at the moment.  The damn memorial day parade is tomorrow...  bright and early...    oh boy.   So I'm dreading that.    Can't wait for school to be over.  No more homework... No more getting up before noon... no more um.... yes.    I ran out of things to say already. This should be an interesting blog.  So I'm sitting here eating butter noodles chattin with some people and listening to music.  Such an interesting life it is.  I'll be back later.

      The concert last night kinda sucked... but everyone I've talked to said we kicked ass.  I need to rock out more though... 2 cans of Red Bull made me shake, but didn't do much to make me go all-out.  Oh well.    I had fun.           I got a new cat...  His name's Beaker... he's really tiny and he's like 2months old or something like that.   All I know for sure is that he's 100% Grade A Psychopath.   and he rarely ever sleeps when he's supposed to. :P      Well that's all for now... I'm gonna go swim for a little bit.

      Well some of us are actually...  Congrats to the class of 2004.  I'll miss some of you more than others. haha      I get ONE day off of band.  That's so great. haha    Drumline practices start on wednesday... It's gonna be awesome.    So graduation was today...  that was the most boring thing I've ever experienced... but the party was well worth it.  Helium is a very good thing to have when you get bored....  I still want to hear my voice though... lol     Well I'm free for the summer basically...  still working on getting a job... and I better find one soon.  I'm getting tired of this POS computer of mine. haha  Well it's midnight.. so I'm gonna finish up on the computer and hit the sack... long day of band practice and nothingness tomorrow.  Sweet freedom.  :-P  "Wake Up" - Three Days Grace

      Wiley... You're an idiot.  After everything I saw you do tonight, then those comments.  Wow.  You're an idiot.       How cool would it have been if that car blew up though?  Too bad we'd be dead... either physically or metaphorically... oh well.  Tonight was awesome. haha Oh yea!  And who's naysaying/naysing?  I just was wondering if we'll be ready!  haha     By the way... what  is  naysing? lol      Is that when you refuse to sing?  :-P  "Bulimic" - The Used

      Yes!  Finals are ALMOST over!!!  The last final is on monday, and that's Physics.  So it's kind of understood that I'm going to fail.  I've already accepted that fact. lol  Who really gives a rats ass anyways.  The second that bell rings at 2 o'clock I'm out of there for the summer.  Well except for the 10 minutes on Wednesday when we have to clean out our god damn lockers... oh well.  I'm probably not even going to that... screw the administration, they can kiss my ass.  It's summer and I'm outta there.  Some people think I'm insane... so I've edited posts and changed some stuff... as to not look  too  insane.... and to those that know me better than most... just keep the question of sanity to yourselves...  I'm  really  not insane.   Maybe a little out there, but not insane. lol  So it's Friday.  You know what that means?      Wait... what  does  that mean in the summer... hmmm   I guess it doesn't really mean much of anything... I can sleep until noon on any day except Wednesday this summer...  Man is the drumline going to kick some major ass this year.  Four hour practices every Wednesday from 9am to 1pm.  So sweet.    So excited!!!       YAY!  Okay I'm bored.  I'm outta here.

      Well today I took my Algebra III and my Eastern Cultures finals... both of them kicked my proverbial ass....    Oh well.    As long as I get through this next 4 days, I'll be home free.  Unless, of course, I end up failing something... and then I'll be hearing about it for the next two years.   So nothing has really happened....    So the summer is upon us, and I still don't have a job.  The lady from Barnes & Nobles still hasn't called me back, and Malec's isn't hiring... so I've got to get out and hunt once finals are over...  If I don't get a job this summer I will be royally pissed off.  If it comes down to it, I can always apply at Giant and become the scum of the universe....   whatever earns me an income.   So tomorrow is a day full of language... German III in the morning and English in the afternoon.  Oh boy.  I'm ready for another day of school kicking my ass... can you tell?  Whatever.  Doesn't really matter to me anymore.  The band has a gig on the 11th... yay.  We haven't really seriously practiced since Jamfest, so this could be really ugly.  All I know is that half of us hate the name, and the other half like the name (Stereo Stroke)....  I like it.  It kinda just grew on me cause I heard it so much from Jamfest and everything...   I made a poster for this gig, but being that school's out, there's nowhere to really post it... I'm thinking about maybe in Roberto's, Cornerstone, and random other places... dunno how that'll work out.  Here's a  urlLink link  to it, and if you can advertise it, feel free, cause the more people we get to come, the better it will be.  And yes, I do realize that the poster doesn't fill the page... I'm just too lazy to fix it right now.  Sorry.  Well I hope to see anyone and everyone there... It should be good, and if it's not... oops oh well.  That's all for now... Sleep time.

      One more day till finals start!  Then home free for the summer!  Can't wait.  Nothing has really happened...  the next Jamfest is on June 11th at the borough hall...   this shall be interesting.  I'm looking forward to it, but I don't know if we'll be ready in time to do a good performance.  Well that's all that's new on the homefront... I'll post more once something interesting happens. :-P  Currently Listening to: "The Greatest Fall" - Matchbook Romance  _TB
