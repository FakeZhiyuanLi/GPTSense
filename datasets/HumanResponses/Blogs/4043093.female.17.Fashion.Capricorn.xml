      Okay so its like 1am on..Friday morning...I gotta work tonite...not looking forward to it, but Im going over to see my aunt today...haven't seen her in awhile, miss her lots! No ones online which sucks, so I'm just sittin here thinking...that's never a good thing, because then I start over-analyzing everything...an thas just stupidity. I wrote a poem a few dayz ago, an can't get it outta my head. One person knows about it, she says I'm nuts for caring about a person like that, lol..but its not like he's going to see it anyways. &nbsp; My mom want's me to go on BC cuz she thinks I'm going to get pregnant..cuz u know its soooo possible*rolling eyes*...not! Whatever, as long as it gets her off my back, I'll do it. I'm goin out for coffee wit Mattchu on Monday or Tuesday, excited about that...haven't seen that kid since school ended...he's awesome, always sendin me songs to make me feel better an lets me vent an get my anger out, when I need to. It's always good to have those friends u can just be able to say anything to an know they wont say a word...I have lots of those, but only a few I trust with everythin...like Courty an Jas an Tay an Chris...lol okay more then a few....its after 1am, my thinkin's not too clear ne more lol &nbsp; This is really long lol...to imagine what it would be like if I actually put all my thoughts down lol! I'm happy Aleah/Jade showed me this thing, its cool cuz&nbsp;I can write in a journal all my thoughts, without wasting paper lol, or bein afraid of the mother seein it. &nbsp;People keep making comments about my msn pic...have u never seen a gals undies before??? like seriousness now! Ne ways time for sleep...ciao:)

      k, so its like monday morning...and I was up at like 9am....why...I don't have the slightest clue! I was supposed to go drop a resume off, but my mom decided not to buy printer ink, as well as the rest of my family...so I can't print off my resume to drop it off. I was also supposed to go to my aunts an fix her comp for her..cuz everytime I go over to do it...shes not home, an that just doesn't work..yea....this time I found half a brain cell an decided to call....guess what? She's NOT HOME! Big surprise there....not.  Aleah wanted me to go clubbin last nite with her, but I was like copletely exhausted an like wanted to go to bed at 8pm ne ways lol so I decided against it..good thing lol cuz I fell asleep watchin a movie at like 930, an woke up at like 1130....good thing I've seent hat movie b4!    I'm so annoyed by ppl right now...they tell you one thing when they want to say another, they say things that they know will make u mad just to see ur reaction, an they just basically completely piss u off to the point of wantin to kill em! haha yes, I'm not in the best of moods, but no I'm not insane lol! Ne ways, this is my boring life for now. If anything excitin happens..I'll be...well....excited lol! ciao
