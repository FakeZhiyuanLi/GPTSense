      Ok, First off i woke up at about 6:30 so I could check if the video i sent to Sleight geek went through. It didnt. We gave adad his fathers day present. A new tshirt and a new printer(what do you think used). We ate french toast for breakfast wich was pretty good. After that i posted on magi-adam-forum. Next,sddly there was church. For felowship there was lemonade, cookies, pretzels(stole tons of those) and little minature sandwithces with some meat that could not be specified. Since Pastor bill couldnt be there beacause of his heart attack there was a guest preacher. He was kind of nice. He craked a few stupid jokes that made absoloutley no sense yet everyone laughed. And like that the service was over. When i got home i saw that the video i sent to magi adam went through. Mredux became the co owner of my forum and its his new site too http://www.mredux.tk. Lunch was just some basic sandwiches with pretty good turkey. After that I got upgraded to the rank of Advance Tutorials on www.magi-adam-forums.tk. And now im just typing this. So far the day has been pretty good.

      Every year I always Decide to give a few bitches honorable mentions. And the Bitch of the Year Award 2004 goes to Rachel Sinclair for her constant hateing me when i really like her. Second place goes to Maggie Willis for being a hot sexy bitch. 3rd place goes to Julia Lafond for being such a cow. Honorable mentions go to Deigo Tomsig and his lover.

      Ok this as you hay of guessed is the girl i like. The only thing that sucks is that she hates me. I try to be as nice as possible to her as possible but still she hate me. I really dont get why? Can someone tell me. On the last day of scholl this year I had and Idea. Our teacher gave back these Journal that we had been writting in all year. When everyone went outside i stayed in and wrote that i liked her in the back. The great thing is that our teacher said to reread everything we wrote in the journal. There for she has to read it. Ths is a great idea to get a girl( ont sure yet lol) but hey try it out and see if it works.

      Ok First of I wake up at 7:30 in the morning to hear some lady screaming into her stupid phone. "There Gone" she said. As you could guess in my head I was thinking " BITCH" Soon i found out that that bitch was the wife of some guy who got stranded on a mountain and couldnt get down. Next nowing my dad (Owns the Gym the guy went to)he jets out of the houe. 2 minutes later the lady calls back and says " WE found them!!" in her stupid perky voice. So I have to go get my dad. From our drive way wich he never left. After that we  went to paint out new church thats going up in July. When we got there there we three cars Ours a fat old lady who is a real asshole and the Wormingtons car(there ok). So we paint for about 30 minutes and then we go back home. I go for a quick swim and then my brother comes in the pool. He jumps in a trys to dround me(Hes 8). He needs to work on his fucking priorities. I soon find out he tryed to do this because I was where his favorite set of googles. Now the Baileys come over to swim. Again my brother decides to be a really ass hole. He takes all the pool toys and claims them in his name. Next he lines them up on the side of the pool so I get out and take all of the stuff from behind. Thge funny thing is he had no clue. What a retard. So next my mom cathches me and she send me up to my room. And thats where I am now typing away at my computer.
