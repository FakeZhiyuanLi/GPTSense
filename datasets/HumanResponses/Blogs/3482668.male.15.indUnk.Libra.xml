      What makes you the lowest of the low? Can it ever be acheived? Why do peoples perspectives change life so much?  If people looked at life differently then things would never be bad. Everything would be good. Life would be great.  "The end of the something i did not want to end,  Begining of hard times to come.  But something that was not meant to be is done,  And this is the start of what was.   He had to unscrew about fifteen screws before he could pull the panel off the back,  To get in the fecking thing;  But just as he did so, he said he saw something,  That slipped inside behind the panel - down the back of it.  Must have been some leaflets or a bill maybe,  I didn't want to lose the bill incase it was a final warning.  So we both treid to get the back off and work out if there was any more screws to get out,  Or if we left any in.  And when he looked down the back of the TV, his eyes just froze,  Before he rammed his hand in saying, no shit.  He's looking at me absolutely speechless, he can't quite believe what he's trying to pull out the slip.  I get up wondering what he's smiling about, he's shaking his head at this point,  With the biggest of grins;  I look down the back of the TV and thats where it was, in all it'sglory - my thousand quid.   The end of the something i did not want to end,  Begining of hard times to come.  But something that was not meant to be is done,  And this is the start of what was.   About 2 this afternoon the last of the people left my house,  'Cause they never stop chattin' til all the rackets gone.  I really feel like things clicked into place at some point,  Or maybe it'sthe fact that me and Alison really got on.  Or maybe it'sthat i realised that it is true;  No-ones really there fighting for you in the last garison.  No-one except yourself that is, no-one except you.  You are the one who's got your back 'til the last deeds done.  Scott can't have my back til the absolute end,  'Cause he's got to look out for what over his horizon.  He's gotta to make sure he's not lonely, not broke.  It's enough to worry about keeping his own head above.  I shut the door behind me, huddled up in my coat,  Condensation floating off my breath, squinted out the sun.  My jeans feel a bit tight, think i washed them a bit too high;  I was gonna be late, so i picked up my pace to run.   The end of the something i did not want to end,  Begining of hard times to come.  But something that was not meant to be is done,  And this is the start of what was.  The end of the something i did not want to end,  Begining of hard times to come.  But something that was not meant to be is done,  And this is the start of what was.  The end of the something i did not want to end,  Begining of hard times to come.  But something that was not meant to be is done,  And this is the start of what was.  The end of the something i did not want to end,  Begining of hard times to come.  But something that was not meant to be is done,  And this is the start of what was"  These lyrics made me think this way (with some help from some good friends). listen to the streets
