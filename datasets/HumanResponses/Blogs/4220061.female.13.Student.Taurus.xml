      Highschool is cool. I have my first block class w/ Luke and Katie, and when they open the wall I have it with Patrick and Lakshmi. I have Spanish with Luke and Katie too. So that's pretty cool I guess. I need to make some new pals... I just have to be nice. My mom teaches a lot of people I know. Kinda weird... but as long as she's nice it won't be a problem. Damn I really wish I was in band. I'm not a big fan of art... it isn't my thing and I wish I was in band but my mommy and sissy are making me do art so I'm kinda upset. I don't know about my teachers yet... they all seem tolerable though. Two of my classes are mainly sophomores (AlgebraII and Chemistry)... people in Chemistry thought I was a Junior... wtf. Well I take that as a big compliment. I sit next to a really nice guy who is named Nolan. He is cuuute! haha Candice is being lame...  I think Bart's eating lunch with my friends tomorrow. Therefore, I will not be eating lunch with my friends tomorrow. Funny how that works...  Party on!  -Candice

      I love it when it's friday the 13th. Great set of slasher movies, if I should say so myself. Yuppp... so I got through my first week of school. I have a lot of homework this weekend. I didn't get froshed. The kid next to me in Chemistry said 'happy freshman friday'. That's just about it, though. My mom teaches so many kids that I know. That is so weird. Around 8 people that I know have her and it is kind of awkward. I think I discussed this in my previous entry. In chemistry I don't know anybody really so I ended up being the dregs of lab partner choices so I'm with this one guy and this one girl and they're probably not too cool, because if they were, then they'd have lab partners. I won't judge- maybe they're like me and just don't know anybody and then we'll all build a friendship that will last a lifetime. I'm being silly again.  I went to the freshman mixer. It was kinda cool I guess. I don't dance... but I kind of did. I hung out with Luke most of the time and i saw Nicole D., Michelle, Patrick and Wesley so I guess it was pretty cool. There were all of these gross people like Mandy and Ryanne and Sarah Murphy and Shane and Zach... all of those really nasty kids all grinding with eachother and I was in tears from laughing so hard. I swear to god, if they were naked... ew don't wanna think about it.  I think that by now, people have figured out that my mother is my mother. 1. My last name 2. I'm from Canada 3. I'm sure she's mentioned me 4. I sometimes stop by between classes The gig is up! As long as she's cool, I do not have a problem with any of it. Ohhhh well.  Party on!  -Candice

      My frog (David Lee Roth) died today. I'm gonna get fish now. They're more low-maintenance and they don't eat live bugs. I want a pleco more than anything. They are soooo cute! I'm also going to get goldfish and guppies and what not. I'm going to name my pleco David Lee Roth II in honour of my frog.  Anyways... today was pretty cool. Nelsey is camping this weekend, so Marissa and Dave took over the karate class. They said the kids class was a little group of hellians, but the adult class was good, so I am glad. Justin was there today... he's so hot. I did some of my homework for this weekend, but I'm not totally finished. I set up my fish tank too- all I need is a filter, some fish, and maybe some cool plastic plants. I'm excited about that stuff (:  Apple Turnovers are one of the best food items ever invented  I find it  quite  upsetting that I do not have any classes with Nicole W.  Party on!  -Candice

      I got three goldfish and a pleco today. The pleco is named Angus, and the goldfish are David Lee Roth, Axl and Slash. They're cute.  I kept setting up the tank and then it'd leak and I'd fix it and then fill it up agian and it'd leak... but it is fixed now so that is good.  I had a lot of homework for the first weekend of school but that's alright, I guess. I wrote a really lame mini-essay on Ari Ben Canaan from  Exodus   I got new shoes. They are Converse One-stars and they're black and white. They rock.  School tomorrow!  Party on!  -Candice

      Starting Wednesday I've been playing badminton for 2 hours a day for tryouts. I hope I make the juniour-varsity team. That'd be pretty badass. My mom says (from watching practice) that i'm one of the best people out there... so I am hopeful. Nobody will mess with me if I'm on jv badminton according to Katie.  What else?  Me and Katie did this skit for  Exodus  today... it wasn't as funny as intended, but we still got our point through with some laughs. I think I'm going to do fine (academically and socially) in Pre-IB. I'm already making some friendly acquaintances with cool people, and I already have some pretty good friends. Life is good in highschool- much better than middle school. Some people really hated me there... A LOT.  I also like to be around smart people, because they aren't so stupid. There are these totally stupid girls that sit behind me in first period that don't know what 'outgoing' means. Damnit, they had better drop out.  Way more hot kids than I thought there would be for loser classes too... but there are also some weird-looking kids. I swear to Gosh that this kid named Michael C. has a glass eye... or a lazy eye... same thing   urlLink http://diaries.suchisthis.com/candicetortoise  -go there to experience Candice's badass essence (I had to switch my blog accounts because my daddy found it and that was pretty terrible)  Alright... that's enough for now!  Party on!  -Candice

      Trevor's been getting really bad nosebleeds lately.  He got two arteries in his nose fused together, but that didn't help.  He's probably going to die.  That makes me very upset.  I am crying.   I rolled my ankle playing badminton recently, and it hurts quite a bit.  It feels better when i wrap it.  I'm going to go to school tomorrow with my ankle wrapped... ughhh that smells.  I'll like have to answer 'What's wrong with your ankle?' like 1000000000 times.  Oh well.  Real badminton tryouts start tomorrow... the last few days have been practice and warm-ups for the tryouts.  I'm scared... and since my ankle is hurt, I may not make the team.  I got a yellow racquet.  It's pretty groovy.  School tomorrow!  Party on!  -Candice
