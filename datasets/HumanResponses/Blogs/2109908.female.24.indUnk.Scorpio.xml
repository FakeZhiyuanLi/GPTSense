       Finding Friends   I couldn't access my other blog site so I decided to do this here.  I think this will be much more accessible to me whenever a new thought pops into my head.  I caught another bandwagon and now I'm addicted to  urlLink friendster.com .  I started out just to hook up with a college friend.  I would have forgotten all about it if a high school friend hadn't asked to be added to my friend's list.  Now, I check it everyday.  I have added friends from high school and college plus my former officemates as well.  I have a grand time checking out who has a profile and found some of my childhood crushes (I couldn't believe I liked them before!).  It's very, very tempting to check out how popular one is by comparing how many friends you have against someone who you really don't like.  What I like most about it is that I can get to reconnect with both old and new friends.  If I want to announce something, I can simply post it on my bulletin board.  I log in and I can send messages to my friends (since they are logged in almost everyday anyway) without having to check out my address books for their email addresses or cellphone numbers. During lunchtime, the whole department went crazy checking on their friendster lists.  They found people who signed in as Mike Arroyo, Heart Evangelista, Luis Manzano, etc. One of the OJTs decided to send a message to the one who is claiming to be Mike Arroyo (his picture also showed GMA!).  We'll see what happens next when he responds.

      The LTO Story  I finally mustered enough courage to go to the LTO last Friday.  I took a leave from work thinking that my situation is probably not as bad as Luthien's.  My Impy was on his way to LB but I persuaded him to accompany me in the morning.  I went to the LTO website and it simply said that an affidavit of loss and the application form.  I have prepared these papers way in advance so it was just a matter of printing it out and having it processed. I first had to have my affidavit of loss notarized so we scoured Cubao early in the morning looking for a notary public.  We found one in one of the old buildings near Farmer's.  Something struck me about that particular building and I'll probably write about it some other time.  Since the renewal office at the Farmer's Plaza was still closed, I decided to go straight to the Cubao LTO office.  When we got there, the place was kind of deserted.  It was unlike any government licensing office that I have gone to before.  When I got to the window and showed my affidavit of loss, I was asked if I have a photocopy of my lost license.  I know that I have one somewhere but I really couldn't recall where.  The guy at the window advised me to go to Window 14 at the LTO main on East Ave.  What choice did I have?  So off we went to East Avenue. When we got to Window 14, I was told that I should go to Window 10. All this time, there was a woman who kept on telling us that she'll help us with the drug test because they were accredited, etc.  I told her that we still have stuff to finish before going through all that and I was already irritated because nobody can tell me what the whole process is.  That woman followed us until the queue at Window 10 and My Impy got irritated himself and told the woman off!  I wanted to laugh out loud because that was pretty unusual behavior from him.  At least it got that pesky woman off our backs. I was given a number after I gave my accomplished forms and affidavit.  The slip has the note that the waiting time was around 58 minutes.  I thanked my lucky stars because around 10 minutes after, they started calling out numbers one after another.  I thought that my luck has shifted and that I would be able to go through the day with stuff accomplished. When my papers got released, nobody told me what to do next.  Thinking that I can go through the renewal there, I approached Window 14 once again asking what I should do next (that was the only window with no one around).  I was asked where I got my license and I answered that it was at the Pasay office.  I was told to go back there to have my application processed!  Hello! It was already lunchtime and that place seemed like light years away! I went back to Window 10 and elbowed my way through the crowd. When I got to the front, I asked what the next step again.  And again, I was told to go to Pasay.  I asked the woman what if I wanted to have it processed somewhere else.  I was told that I have to get a certification and that it would be released on Monday at 2 pm.  Duh!  Having no choice, I decided to just ask for the certification.  I was thinking that I can just take an extended lunch break on Monday and drop by LTO. Feeling dejected with nothing accomplished, I told Impy that I wanted to eat at the Batchoy place at the SM Cubao and that I wanted to do a bit of shopping since I needed a new pair of jeans.  When we finally get back to Cubao, the Batchoy place is closed and I was so hungry.  I didn't want to eat at our usual food places so I said I wanted the Tropical Hut clubhouse sandwich. (I was that hungry.)  Since I didn't eat breakfast, my tummy rumbled after I drank the soda and filled it with a lot of food.  I couldn't take it so I ended up going home. My whole day went to waste! I told my dad about it and he told me that he really can't do anything about it.  He said it all boils down to why I lost my license in the first place.  How was I to know that my desk at the office is NOT a safe place to put my bag on.  To think that building is a "secured" one because of all the embassies and other offices. The next Monday, I was supposed to take the afternoon off so that I can finally process my license application.  However when I got to the office that morning, my boss told me that there was a week-long training for the new system to be installed.  Being the one who will be in charge of its deployment down the line, I had no choice but to attend.  I told my boss that I need to get to LTO by 2pm but I'll be back to finish the day. She agreed so I did not go back to the training room in the afternoon and by 1pm I was in a cab rushing to the LTO. I got to East Avenue with a few minutes to spare so I decided to eat at Jollibee first.  I gave my claim slip to Window 10 and I was told that my name will be called when it is released.  I prepared for a long wait while praying it will not be that long since I had to go back to the training session. Two batches of names were called and I was still waiting for mine.  When the third batch of names were called, my name was the last one and I immediately went to Window 11.  When it was my turn to talk to the guy, I gave him my name and he told me that my name is NOT on the list.  I told him that I would not be standing in front of him if I did not hear my name called.  He riffled through the papers in his hand without really looking at it and then declared that it was not there.  He was asking me whether the first name was Mauricio and I looked at him in puzzlement.  I wanted to ask him if I looked like a Mauricio.  Again, I insisted that my name is there and that I'm in a rush.  He went through tha papers again and in the middle of the pile, he found my name.  Instead of giving it to me, he held it up, pretending to examine it closely.  I was already giving him the eye and if I could just get my hands past the barrier I could have just grabbed it.  He probably did that to save face because he argued with me that it's not there when in fact it was.  He then handed it over and told me,  Punta ka na sa agency .  I took what he said to heart with the rush that I was in.  I grabbed my papers as soon as it was thrust through the glass and made my way out of there.  I was already in the cab when I noticed that the document says that I paid 30 bucks for it.  I haven't paid anything and was surprised that nobody mentioned anything about it.  Usually, that is the first thing that they mention, the payment.  And since the guy told me to go the licensing agency already, I thought I need not do anything. I'm gonna go to the Farmer's Express renewal center (they are open on Saturdays) since I can't afford to miss any work anymore.  I'm not in a rush to finish it all up since I'm already gonna be penalized regardless of when I do it.  I don't really drive regularly (more like at all) so there is no urgent need for the license.  Bottomline, I still don't have my license and I'm not altogether sure if I can have it renewed any time soon.

       A Look at the 2004 Candidates Volume 1    For your consideration.... Fernando Poe Jr.   Ginoong Patnugot:  Napansin namin na inilathala ninyo kamakailan ang isang sulat na naghihikayat sa ating mga kababayan na sulatan si Fernando Poe Jr. upang huwag nang tumakbo bilang pangulo ng Pilipinas.    Hindi namin alam kung saan ninyo nakuha ang impresyon na di magiging mabuting pangulo si Fernando Poe Jr. Kami po, ang kanyang mga kaibigan ay lubos na nasaktan sapagkat hindi man lang binigyan ng pahayagang ito ng sapat na pagkakataon na ipagtanggol ni FPJ ang kanyang sarili. Hindi po ito mabuting halimbawa ng mabuting pamamahayag.  Salungat sa mga balita na inyong kinakalat na walang alam si Fernando  Poe Jr. sa pagpapatakbo ng bansa, si FPJ ay mayroong napakalawak na karanasan tungkol sa mga isyu na kasalukuyang pinagdaraanan ng ating bansa.  Ang sumusunod ay ilan lamang sa mga patunay sa pagiging malapit ni FPJ  sa mga isyung pambansa.  Hustisya. Kapag Puno na ang Salop Nakikipaglaban si FPJ sa mga suhulang Huwes. Pag naging pangulo si FPJ, maraming mamamatay na huwes.  Kahirapan. Ang Anino ni Asedillo Katulad ng kanyang matalik na kaibagan na si Presidente Erap, malapit si Fernando Poe Jr. sa mahihirap. Sa pelikulang ito, si FPJ ay isang modern-day Robin Hood. Kumukuha siya sa mayayaman tapos binibigay sa mahirap. Yan ang aming idol. Ngayon pa lang ay mag-ingat na si Danding at ang mga Ayala!   Kidnapping at Drugs. Batas ng Lansangan Sa Batas ng Lansangan, sinalo ni FPJ ang pananagutan para labanan ang kidnapping at drugs. Kapag pangulo na si Fernando Poe Jr., lilinisin nya sa ating mga lansangan ang mga kidnapper at drug-pusher. Ano ba ang laban ng mga masasamang loob sa mga ma-armalite na mga suntok ni Haring FPJ?  Manggagawa. Isusumbong kita sa Tatay ko Isang masipag na manggagawa si Fernando Poe Jr. Naranasan na nya ang maging isang mekaniko habang nagpapalaki ng kanyang anak na si Judy Anne. Ang kanyang hirap at pagtatiyaga ay kapansin pansin sa malimit na pagpapawis ng kanyang kili-kili sa pelikulang ito. Ipinahihiwatig lamang nito na pagpapawisan nya ng lubos ang kanyang pagtatrabaho sa ating mga Pilipino.  Illegal Gambling. Dito sa Pitong Gatang Bilang barangay chairman tinugsa ni Fernando Poe Jr. ang illegal gambling sa kanilang barangay. Sinong nagsabi na walang political experience si FPJ?  Marahil, kapag naging pangulo si Fernando Poe Jr.,  malamang na gagawing kapitolyo ng Pilipinas ang Pitong Gatang.  Pulisya at Krimen. Eseng ng Tondo Naging isang magaling na Pulis rin si FPJ bago sya naging NBI director. Dito natin nakita kung paano nakipaglaban si FPJ sa masasama at mga suhulang elemento ng lipunan. Ang kanyang pakikipaglaban at patuloy na  magpapatupad ng reporma sa pulisya ay ipagpapatuloy ng kanyang kapatid na si Conrad Poe bilang bagong hepe ng PNP.  Sports. Pakners Kasama di Efren "Bata" Reyes bilang bagong kalihim ng POC, lahat ng national athletes ay kanyang patuturuang magbilyar.  Ginoong Patnugot, siguro'y di na kami nagkulang ng patunay kung bakit dapat maging pangulo si Fernando Poe Jr. Sana po ay di na maulit ang mga irresponsableng "Open Letter" na walang pakundangan ninyong inilathala dito sa inyong pahayagan.   Salamat po.     Ang inyong mga linkod,   Alyansa ng Pitong Gatang (APoG)

        Know Your Presidentiables    Again another email received...   PRESIDENT ARROYO  Banking on "experience and integrity"   PRESIDENT Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo became president in January 2001  following the successful People Power 2 Revolution that deposed her  predecessor, Joseph Estrada. Arroyo will run for president under the  Koalisyon ng Katapatan at Karanasan sa Kinabukasan or K-4.   She was elected vice president in 1998 with the largest electoral  margin in Philippine history, with a vote of more than seven million.   As vice president, she was given the portfolio of Secretary of Social  Welfare and Development, a post which she held until October 2000.   She was first elected as senator in 1992 and reelected in 1995. She  also topped the elections with a record number of votes (16 million).  Her legislative efforts as senator were focused on building the  economy.   During her two terms, she filed 472 bills and resolution, 54 of which  were enacted into law. Among these laws are Tax Exemption for the  13th Month Pay, Export Development Act, Loans for Women Micro  Enterprises, Build-Operate-Transfer Law, Bank Entry Liberalization  Law, Thrift Banks Act, Anti-Sexual Harassment Law, Crop Insurance  Law, Indigenous People's Rights Law, Poverty Alleviation Law, New  Rent Control Law and the Magna Carta for Scientists, Engineers,  Researchers and other Science and Technology Personnel in Government.   During the Aquino administration, Arroyo was Assistant Trade  Secretary. She was also appointed Executive Director of the Garment  and Textile Board. She was later named Trade Undersecretary and  Governor of the Board of Investments.   She obtained a Bachelor of Arts and Economics degree, magna cum  laude, from the Assumption College (1968). She was a consistent  Dean's Lister during her studies in International Trade at the  Georgetown University in Washington D.C. She later earned a Masters  degree in Economics from the Ateneo de Manila University (1978) and a  Doctorate in Economics from the University of the Philippines (1985).   Macapagal-Arroyo is a recipient of the Rockefeller Foundation  Scholarship (1978-1983), the Japan Foundation Grant (1976-1977) and  the UPSE Fellowship (1970-1971).   She was also chairman and president of the UP Health Maintenance  Organization (1989-1998); executive director of the Philippine Center  for Economic Development (1994-1998); and chairman of the UP Economic  Foundation (1994-1998).  From 1994-1998, she was member of the Presidential Task Force on Tax  and Tariff Reforms. She was also a member of the Technical Working  Group of the Philippine National Development Plan for the 21st  Century (Committee on National Framework for Regional Development and  Macroeconomics Framework for Development Financing.)   In the academe, Macapagal-Arroyo was chair of the Assumption College  Economics Department (1984-1987), assistant professor at the Ateneo  de Manila University and professor at the UP School of Economics  (1977-1987). She was also a professor at the Maryknoll College and  St. Scholastica's College.   She received the following citations: "Most Outstanding Senator" from  the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines, "One of Asia's Most  Powerful Women" of the Asiaweek Magazine and "Woman of the Year" of  the Catholic Educators Association of the Philippines.   She is the daughter of the late President Diosdado Macapagal and Dr.  Evangeline Macaraeg. She is married to Jose Miguel T. Arroyo. They  have three children, Juan Miguel, Evangelina Lourdes and Diosdado  Ignacio.     FERNANDO POE JR. From reel to real   FERNANDO Poe Jr., the presidential candidate of the "Angara-faction">  of the opposition Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino, was born Ronald  Allan Kelly Poe in Manila on Aug.20, 1939 to Elizabeth Kelley and  actor producer Fernando Poe Sr. His brother Andy is also an actor. He  is married to actress Susan Roces (Jesusa Sonora). They have a  daughter, Mary Grace. He quit high school to work as a messenger in a  film exchange office.   Poe began his career in the movies as a stuntman for Everlasting  Pictures. He was actor Lilia Dizon's double in Sonaron (Unfamed) in  1955. In his first acting role in Anak ni Palaris (Son of Palaris) in  1950, Poe shared top billing with Rosita Noble and Mario Escudero.  Director Mario Barri gave him his screen name, after his father who  had earlier played the title role in Palaris in 1946. But Poe's  biggest break was in Lo Waist Gang in 1956. It marked the local  cinema's shift from the fantasy world of costume productions to the  trendy realism of action movies. His first solo movie was Tough Guy  (1956). He was then signed up by Premiere Productions as a contract  actor. Poe proved his boxe office appeal in Kamay ni Cain (Hand of  Cain, 1957) where he received a Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and  Science (Famas) nomination. When Hollywood Far East Productions  opened, Poe was offered to do Markado (Branded), 1959, and upon his  demand, he was paid a much higher talent fee than he used to get. He  invested his savings in his own company, the FPJ Productions and  D'tanor productions.   Other movies where Poe played lead roles were Apollo Robles, 1961;  Sandata at Pangako (Weapon and Promises), 1961; Ako ang Katarungan (I  am Justice) 1962; Santo-Domingo (Saint Domingo), 1972; Ang Alamat  (The Legend), 1972; Perlas ng Silangan (Pearl of the Orient) 1973;  Sanctuario (Sanctuary), 1974; Patayin si Mediavitto (Kill  Mediavitto), 1978; and Lihim ng Guadalupe (Secret of Guadalupe) 1979.   Under the name Ronwaldo Reyes, Poe has directed many of the FPJ films  that he himself has acted in like Alupihang Dagat (Sea Centipede),  1975 ; Kin,g 1978; Tatak ng Tondo (Mark of Tondo), 1978; Ang Padrino  (The Godfather). 1984; and Panday (Blacksmith) I, II, III and IV.  Awarded by the Famas were Panday II (1984) for best special visual  effects; Poe received nominations for best director from the Film  Academy of the Philippines for Panday III and Padreno. In most of  those movies, he played a hero who is peace loving; until he is  pushed against the wall by all sorts of kontrabida, and magnificently  rises in defense of the poor and the oppressed.    RAUL ROCO  Counting on the youth   Raul S. Roco was born Oct. 26, 1941 in Naga City, Camarines Sur to  farmer Sulpicio Azuela Roco and public schoolteacher Rosario Orlanda  Sagarbarria. He will run for president under Aksyon Demokratiko.   He finished elementary and high school at the Ateneo de Naga. He  earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, magna cum laude, at San  Beda College in Manila. Roco received his Bachelor of Laws as Abbott  Awardee for Over-All Excellence at San Beda College. e took his  Master of Comparative Law as a University Fellow at the University of  Pennsylvania, USA.   Roco formed the Aksyon Demokratiko political party for his  presidential bid. He is married to Sonia Cubillo Malasarte, who was  named most outstanding student of the Philippines in 1964. They have  six children - Rabble Pierre, Raul Jr., Sophia, Sareena, Rex and  Synara-and four grandchildren.   Roco was the president of the National Union of Students of the  Philippines in 1961 and was one of the Ten Outstanding Students of  the Philippines in 1964. He was a delegate to the Constitutional  Convention of 1971 and was president of the Integrated Bar of the  Philippines from 1983 to 1985. As a member of the legal staff of the  late Sen. Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, he drafted the Study Now, Pay Later>  Law.   Taking time off from his legal work, he was executive producer of the  late great film director Lino Brocka's movie Tinimbang Ka Ngunit  Kulang, which won six Famas Awards including best film in 1974.   The Ford Foundation and the University of the Philippines Institute  of Strategic and Development Studies adjudged him first in overall  performance among legislators of the Eighth Congress from 1987 to  1992. He was also consistently cited top senator during his term in  the Senate from 1992 to 2000.   As a senator, Roco authored the law that reformed the central banking  system. The achievement earned him the title "Father of the Bangko  Sentral." Roco helped fund the teachers' cooperatives as well as  initiated the increment mandated by the Magna Carta for Public School  Teachers for retiring public school teachers. As a senator, Roco also  authored the Women in Nation Building Law, the Nursing Act, the Anti-  Sexual Harassment Law, the Anti-Rape Law and the Child and Family  Courts Act. He led efforts that resulted in the abolition of double  taxation for overseas workers.   Roco's vision for education is "Bawat graduate bayani at marangal"  or "Each graduate is a hero and a person of dignity." As Secretary of  Education, Roco implemented, for the first time in Philippine  educational history, free public primary and high school education.  He also implemented an education curriculum reform, which focused on  reading, writing, arithmetic, science and Makabayan subjects.   When Roco took over as education secretary in January 2001, the Asia  Foundation-Social Weather Stations Survey of Enterprises on Public  Sector Corruption ranked his department the fourth most corrupt  government agency. Roco quickly imposed a department-wide  transparency policy, including the purchase of textbooks, one of the  biggest sources of corruption in the DepEd. As a result, in only  eight months, the same survey group ranked the Department of  Education the most trusted agency of the government. It was given a  73 percent approval rating by the public.    SEN. PANFILO LACSON  Law and order count   SEN. Panfilo "Ping" M. Lacson hopes to put his crime-fighting crusade  to greater heights by aspiring for the presidency.

Lacson had his primary education at the Bayang Loma Elementary  School. He finished high school at the Imus Institute.

        rant    Results of my performance review...   What do you do when you learn that you have been working under the wrong assumption for the past seven months?  Me, I'm not so sure that it has sank in yet.  I took this job primarily as a change of pace.  I have been inside a classroom teaching and training for a year and a half previous to this post.  It's not that I don't like teaching - I LOVE it!  However, when it became too tedious and routine, I found myslef trying to break away from it.  This is the reason why I decided to take on the quality assurance position in this company.  All along, my boss had different plans for me - plans that she did not communicate clearly.  I thought that handling the soft skills training for the department is just an interim job while we are setting up the QA team.  It was fine with me and I enjoyed pitching in to train whenever needed.  Knowing that my position is under QA, my mindset is really on developing these ideas that are primarily QA functions.  I just had my performance review this morning without any real worries.  I knew that I was working well enough with the people and that the job was of no major burden to me or anything.  My review turned out to be consistently meets which was fine.  When I asked her to clear up my focus and responsibilities, she dropped the bomb that I was hired primarily to be THE soft skills trainer.  She recounted how she had to defend the creation of the position, etc.  I am uncomfortable about this on several points.  First of all, I did not prepare my mindset to stay with soft skills.  I am not too comfortable with soft skills training.  My forte is more on the technical side of things.  However, in this company, technical training is really technical requiring certification from Microsoft and other companies.  Second, soft skills is not a priority in this organization.  I would need to sell my expertise and the idea of having a full time position of such skill in the organization.  My boss had to go to the top just to defenc the need for this position.  Now, I have to maintain that and reinforce my tenure by showing improvement in the numbers.  Third, with the prevailing attitude toward soft skills, I would need to be thick-skinned to face the barbs that are liable to be thrown my way.  I do not like having to play office politics.  However, if I want to keep my job with my reputation intact, I would have to be actively looking for alliances with those in the management team so that I can sell my expertise to all levels of the organization.  There is enough politics on the higher levels of the organization and I do not want to get involved in it.  Fourth, No one here is going to watch my back with the risks that I would like to take in the position of the soft skills trainer.  I have no resources to speak of and most of my resources can only be gotten through the people around me.  That means that it is another round of politics.  My boss backs me up all the way but she can only do as much.  I need to settle the thought first.  I have a clear mandate from the boss to make sure that the program I am handling is smooth sailing and worth the time and money that they spent on it.  This with virtually no resources to speak of!!!  I even had to shell out MY OWN money (which I need for a hospital procedure) just so I can get it started.  Given the chance, I would have been screaming my head off at this very moment! Gaaak!

       Taking on the World   I went through the process of preparing my development plan for work.  I pretty much committed myself to influencing the customer satisfaction rating of the teams. *sigh* Yeah right, as if one person can influence what our customers around the world think.  Things are being hurled at me one after the other.  It has floored me several times this past week but I think things have picked up from how I was feeling last week.  I managed to get one project that has been pending since March off the ground today.    Didn't matter if I had to go in to work today, at least the training session was pretty well received.  I didn't conduct it but I fought hard to have this particular vendor conduct it for us since they are way much better than the one that we used to have.  The training manager and I split up the logistics between the two of us.  I got aprops from the consultants so I take it that I haven't botched up the job.  Next week, I have to go oversee sessions on Saturday  AND  Sunday.  Actually, Saturday might also mean that I will be delivering a training session for another team.  And it's possible that I would not get paid for those days.  It's not a loss for me altogether since I will learn and pick up stuff that I can use some time in the future in the sessions that I will be handling.  I have a clearer mandate now but it means more work for me.  I've always said that it's not the money that drives me but the learning and the fun.  It still is true today and I hope it will carry me through.

        Tired     It's the beginning of my week but I feel so tired.  I have been working since Saturday because of the training sessions that have been happening concurrently.  Yesterday, I had to make up to my cousin and brother so we went out and loitered in a mall for a good part of the day.  Now, my lower back is aching.  My neck too.  Hope this is not the signal of a bad week ahead.

       Friendster-less   The IT people are now on to us.  Yesterday, one of my officemates approached me and asked me to check out  urlLink  Friendster  .  I tried it out from my PC and the browser brought me to our enterprise homepage!  They probably realized that a lot of people are eating up the bandwidth by frequently checking the site and uploading pictures.  Not to mention, some things get set aside just so someone can go check on Friendster.  On the upside though, we can still access  urlLink MySpace  according to my officemate. ^_^  The loss of friendster in the office is not really a big thing for me. The novelty of the social networking thing has been lost to me.  I still check it and do my mass mailing there but I can live without it.

      I heard some whispers from my officemates regarding a change in management asignments.  One of the items they were talking about was about having a new division completely focused on training.  When my boss and I talked later today, she told me that there were changes that I needed to know but that the timing was not right.  When I told her that I already heard the whispers she spilled the whole story.  I will have a new direct report manager since it is but logical that I go with the other division.  They have not told others yet since the director has not yet made the big announcement.  There are several more major changes and what I know only refers to the one that directly affects me.  I'm okay with my new manager since I have been working with him on a particular project and I know how to deal with him.  He is pretty generous and we are more like minded compared to my current boss.  It's just that I have a certain attachment with my current boss since she was my first boss.  She offered me this job and took me in with utmost confidence in my abilities.  After she broke the news to me this afternoon, she told me that she will still be there for me as a coach should I need her.  Here's hoping that things will be all right when the reorganization gets finalized.  Maybe my apprehensions about having to sell my expertise will dissipate as this mandate is now much clearer.

      All of a sudden I felt like I was useless. I can still see the value of the job that I am doing but the off hand manner people deal with me make me feel so unappreciated.  I am not expecting any long term glory for the things that I do, it's part of my job.  When I got into training, I learned that while it is a noble undertaking, the glory is not commensurate.  In my previous company, the training team is known to be the go to guy, very reliable and does everything with utmost flair.  Now I'm finding myself in an organization that while they value training, they don't really value it the way it should be taken.  People on the inside are telling me "to spread my wings and fly."  How can I do that if there is actually no space to spread my wings?  The only way that I can spread my wings and fly is if I get out of this stifling atmosphere.  I know of a lot of places where I have a vast area in which I could fly and soar to the highest echelons.  Why am I still here then?  My pride is holding me back.  I don't want to be labelled as a job hopper.  I don't want to leave all my programs hanging.  I want to leave with my name intact with a string of successes tucked under my belt.  All the while that I am waiting for the realization of these ambitions, the work keeps piling on and the downdraft keeps pulling me down.

      I finished reading Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code last night.  I have always been drawn to these types of stories because it explored the mysteries in history.  I won't go into details as it will be a spoiler for those who are planning to read the book.  I felt that the ending was a little bit flat.  I agree with the reviews that it is an engaging story from beginning to end.  However, there are instances in the narrative where I could only go "huh?"  The revelation of the antagonist for one did not sit well with me.  That person's motivation seems so superficial compared to the deliberate motivations of the other characters.  The controversial topic(s) discussed in the book are not that farfetched but probably too exaggerrated in the exposition.  This is possibly to make a more sinister antagonist and to help the story along.  I enjoyed the puzzles and I tried to work on them as well with the limited background of the whole history.  Actually, I was able to figure out the last setting while Langdon was still thinking about it. :P

       urlLink GMA still in a blue funk over ‘false’ news of Angelo’s release   While I feel utmost sympathy towards the family of Angelo dela Cruz, I share the sentiment Max Soliven has written in this column.  I have no prblem regarding the news blackout since it's a matter of National Security.  It is not easy to decide to pull out our troops be it a measly contingent of 51.  This shows a vulnerability that if they want to force the Philippine government to do something, all they have to do is hold a citizen hostage and threaten to kill him or her.  I appreciate all the efforts the government is doing but I would appreciate it more if they can address the need for jobs in our country.

      Eto ang mahirap kapag nagta-trabaho ka sa isang opisinang puro bata pero malaki ang sweldo.  Kapag may lumabas na bagong gadget  o di kaya magbagsak presyo ang isang kumpanya, nagiging usap-usapan ang pagbili.  Pagdating kanina ng katabi ko sa upuan, sabi niya na may promo ang Smart na ang mga makabagong cellphone ay ibinibigay sa mga plan ng libre.  Kasama dun sa mga pagpipilian ang paborito kong P900 at Treo 600.  Nandun din sa listahan ang hinihintay kong Voyager SPV pati na rin ang O2 XDA.  Naisipan nung kaopisina kong sabihin sa akin yun dahil malamang daw na interesado ako.  Di man niya sinabi ng tahasan, pakiramdam ko lang ay minata ang aking Nokia 6150.  Aba, ano naman ngayon kung ang telepono kong ginagamit ay sinauna pa (circa 1999)?  Ang dahilan ko sa aking 6150 ay dahil mayroon akong PDA na may kamera na rin naman.  Aanhin ko ang makabagong features ng telepono e samantalang mayroon naman dun sa PDA ko?  Oo nga at maganda ang magkasamang PDA at cellphone, tulad nga ng nabanggit ko, pinapangarap ko ang mga Smartphone at PDA/phone.  Pero bakit naman ako bibili kung gumagana pa ang mga gamit ko ngayon at tama naman siya sa kinakailangan ko?  Dahil ba sa hindi na uso ang teleponong gamit ko ngayon?  Ngayon lang, yung ibang kaopisina ko ay nag-uusap na pupunta sila sa Smart Wireless Center pagkatapos mananghalian.  Hanggang ika-labing anim ng Hulyo na lang ang itatagal ng promo na ito kaya dapat magdesisyon na sila kung gusto nilang kumuha ng linya.  Karamihan sa kanila ay kukuha ng linyang may halagang 1200 pesos kada buwan para lang makuha ang telepono.  Matatali sila sa kontratang ito sa loob ng 36 na buwan!  ayos lang sa kanila ang ganitong bayaran samatalang meron na rin silang ganung plano na Globe!  Para lang sa teleponong kasama nung plano, magdadagdag sila ng isa pang bayarin na di naman nila siguradong magagamit!  Mukhang malaki nga ang diperensya ng mga sweldo namin kung gugustuhin nilang madagdagan ang mga bayarin nila ng ganun.  Hindi ko namang sinsabi na magaling ako pagdating sa pera.  Sa katunayan, malaking bahagi sa sweldo ko ay diretso pambayad ng credit card.  Kadalasang pera ko sa bangko ay sapat lang sa pang-araw-araw kong gastos.  Pero nararamdaman ko ang halaga ng bawat gastusin.  Ang bisyo ko lang naman ay pagkain at libro.  Mahilig ako sa makabagong gamit pero kadalasang pinananatili kong panaginip o pangarap ang mga yun.  Hindi yun dahil sa wala akong pera kundi ayokong magipit ng isang bagay na di ko naman kailangan.  Sabi ko sa kaopisina ko kanina, pag-iisipan ko kung kukuha ako nung telepono.  Napag-isipan ko na di ako mamamatay kung di ko siya mabili ngayon.

      I don't agree with the early pull out of the Philippine contingent from Iraq. It sent the wrong message to the international community by letting insurgents (if you can call them just that) dictate government policy. However, this is just inane and petty.&nbsp; Big, leader of the free world is acting like a a big baby.   " You said you were my friend. You left me hanging there. I don't like you anymore. Pffft!

      I don't know if this is going to start happening in the Philippines as well.  I like this shift better than the routine 8-5 or 9-6 since I don't run into traffic and I feel like I can get a lot more things done.  I just went to this 6-3 shift and it has been refreshing despite the fact that I need to sacrifice by going to sleep early.  The best things about a Monday 6 am shift: 1. No traffic on the road or on the elevators. 2. No one else is in the office yet so I can set up things the way I like them. 3. I can have a leisurely cup of hot cocoa (not much of a coffee-drinker) at my desk while I'm setting up. 4. The restrooms are clean.
