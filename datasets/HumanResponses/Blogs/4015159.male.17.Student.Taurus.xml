        Don't you just HATE it when some ignorant Bitch talks directly into your face... well as you may tell I got a dodgy customer at work today... here's a short script of what happened:           James is on the till at Pets At Home, Old Hag walks up to him...             Old Hag: Where's that Johnsons Cat Pet Littertray cleaner?     Jimbles: Pardon?           Old Hag looks fed up, she talks into James's face...             Old Hag: That Johnsons Cat Pet Littertray cleaner!           Note: James is trying to serve customers. Laura (The Deputy Manager comes over)             James (To Laura): Could you help this Lady Please?     Laura (To Old Hag): How can I help you?     Old Hag: I want some of that Johnsons Cat Pet Littertray cleaner!           Laura and James are both confused because the Old Hag is slurring her words, she may be drunk... Laura tries to dismiss the Old Hag...             Laura: I don't think we sell it...           Old Hag is furious.             Old Hag: I've bought it from here before!           Laura thinks for a second, she takes the Old Hag to the product. The Old Hag comes back to the till to pay, at this moment in time there is no queue... After the sale is put through, Old Hag has got yet ANOTHER querie!             Old Hag: I bought a Playpen a couple of weeks ago and the bottom latch is stiff, I've lost my receipt what can I do?     James: You'd be better off asking Laura because if you've lost your receipt I'm not sure...           Old Hag is VERY furious. Note: A queue is building up... GRAVY!!!!!             Old Hag: I've got two cats to feed at home, I haven't got time!     James: Well if you've lost your receipt then I'm afraid you'll have to ask the deputy manager because I'm not sure...     Old Hag: I HAVEN'T LOST MY RECEIPT! I keep a record of all my receipts! But I ma have misplaced or mislaid it.     James: Oh well bring it back and get a refund.           Old Hag leaves, still unhappy. Tempted to say go and get hit by a car, but I'm not that heartless: I wouldn't want the driver to feel guilty!             Anyway it seems that The Old Hag was drunk or mentally ill, I don't care though, she was being a rare bitch and talking into my face, I don't like it when people talk into my face because it's intimidating and rude... Anyway I passed todays task as you  can see but I won't decide tomorrow's until after work...          TTFN

        Thats right people, I have failed todays task. With my forgetful nature I haven't called no more than 1 person chicken. Anyways just gives me more reason to look forward to tomorrows, or does it? I haven't decided the task yet and it can't be too big because I'm working 9-6 :-(. So what to do, what to do, what to do???????? Check it out:       &nbsp;   The Fifth Task       &nbsp;   Tomorrow I will making a campaign poster for Nadia to win Big Brother 5, I will have between the hours 7 and 8 to complete this task. The campaign poster will be displayed in my bedroom window! And I'll also put it on this for you guys!       &nbsp;   TTFN, James

        After passing yesterdays task (of hating Spider-Man) I must now complete todays task... Here it is...       &nbsp;   The Fourth Task       &nbsp;   CHICKEN! This is what I must call everyone today. Today may be Michelle's last day on Big Brother and so this task is to honour the Geordie lass who should be the winner in my eyes, even if she is a crazy stalker!       &nbsp;   Not much to blog about at the moment, I'll be back later though to blog your freaking brains out!

        I'm fed up and I feel like crying or hitting something. This past week since my parents got back all I've done is be a slave for them and what have I got in return? Being called a Lazy Shit by my Dad. I'm not having a go but there are A LOT of people my age who don't work! I work, I hate it but I work, so how am I lazy??? I don't get how one minute my Dad can be perfectly fine with me and the next he's a complete and utter prick and he won't stop bullying me (so to speak).       &nbsp;   I'm having one of those days today whee I really feel like lashing out on the first person that does anything wrong to me, I haven't been like this in ages!

        Last Night and this morning I've been doing A LOT of thinking about my friends and how they've all stuck by me these past 3 years. I met my current gang of friends back in year 10, only meeting them when I started walking to dinner with them. I met Andy, Andy, Danny, Billy, Sam and the rest of the crew... some I already knew, others were totally new people to me. I came in to the group as an outsider but I was accepted and within weeks became part of one of the best friendship groups to be formed in our school. I never used to be the most social person in the world but my friends brought that side out of me and because of them I am who I am today. Over the last 3 years I've changed a lot, and I think I owe the change to them. I don't believe I've met greater, more unique, people than the ones I hang around with today. I look forward to the parties we have, the trips to the cinema and bowling. I just wish that over the six week holidays I could see them more, they mean everything to me. Not a single day goes by when I don't think of them... I've been through a lot of different friends during my school life and even though I'm always with my friendship group I have branched off, but for some reason it's never the same and I start going back to who I was before, someone I don't want to be. Some people make me upset, paranoid, but my friendship group don't, not anymore anyway. I know I can trust them... and always will be able to.       &nbsp;   James

        Ladies, Gentlemen, Boys, Girls... Today I have been on a journey... A JOURNEY so great I have failed, I have passed, and I will be going back. And it won't be the first time I've gone back, for I have been there more times than I can count. I would say that this one journey will be a part of my life as long as I live.       &nbsp;   Ladies and Gentlemen, fasten thy seatbelts... I have completed Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Brothers 3!!!       &nbsp;   OK OK, its not as exciting as I made it out to be, for you lot anyway, for me I have no more stress to worry about! This one level was REALLY starting to TICK ME OFF! Anyways I managed to kick its ass in the end, and now Bowser is in a dark murky pit, waiting to be reawakened for Super Mario World. Which I'll probably buy 2 week on Thursday... ROFL... I WILL BEAT BOWSER AGAIN! He has just become my immortal enemy, and I won't give up until Nintendo decide to stop writing him into games!       &nbsp;   So what if I get into games just that LITTLE bit too much?       &nbsp;   Good Night, God Bless!       &nbsp;   James - ed

        I have completed my second task, but I'm having difficulties uploading it to this blog because when I upload it it isn't the right size :-(...       &nbsp;   Anyway I'm sure I'll find a way, the main thing is it's complete and therefore I must put another pound in the jar. Now I will reveal tomorrows task...       &nbsp;   The Third Task       &nbsp;   Tomorrow, for ONE DAY ONLY. I will hate SPIDER-MAN! If I can go all day despising the superhero then another pound will go in the jar. So my fellow homosapiens, feel free to tease me!

        After SUCCESFULLY passing yesterdays task I seem to be having a problem with todays, I've got all the pictures I need and I even have a story planned but I can't find my digicam->computer connection cable. :'(. Soon I'm going to start tearing the house apart looking for it, should be fun! like finding a fragment of a needle in 3 haystacks.       &nbsp;   I'm also, in this blog, going to talk about a phrase often used on Big Brother. "The Housemates have successfully passed the task." Could they pass the task unsuccessfully, or could they fail it successfully? It's basically adding another word that isn't needed. Unless it is, let me know!

        Well peeps, seems as though I've passed todays task, however the Yazoo is strangely whispering my name... Odd! Anyways unless by accident i slip into a cocacola room I think I'm safe from failing.       &nbsp;   I've made the set designs for my LOTR story tomorrow, I have a happy meadow, a flaming dungeon, a corridor, a disco and stage curtains! :D:D:D. It will be fun! Tomorrow I'm also going for a haircut and having my weekly driving lesson. I've got some blue gel that I'm going to put in my hair, should look pretttttttttty cool! You thought I was gonna say pretty didn't you! Teehee. Anyways I'm off to bed!       &nbsp;   So Long, Farewell, Auf Wiedersein, Goodybe!       &nbsp;   James :P

        Just short of&nbsp;4 hours now and I'll have completed my task. I've had about 4 glasses of water today and each and every one makes me hate it more. Water also seems to uppen your urination requirements... Anyway... if I don't complete this task now it'll be very strange or by mistake or force. So now to answer the question on everyones mind... What task tomorrow?        &nbsp;    The Second Task        &nbsp;    Tomorrow I will be making a story using my Lord of the Rings collectors models! It will be displayed on here!

        Is it me or does tea taste better on Tuesdays? Well today I'm not drinking a single drop of any fluid apart from water, should be quite an easy task because who needs milk, coke, milkshake........... I DO! My taste buds will be deprived of all fluid that is tasty today but I MUST complete this first task! All you people probably think it's going to be easy but you all probably like water, well water BORES me like crazy! So today I'm going to be ripping my hair out, or I could always give in and drink a Yazoo Banana flavoured milkshake, which is my favourite drink EVER! And they're probably really cold by now... hmmmm. Check back later to see how I'm doing!       &nbsp;   James

        To prevent boredom over the seven week holidays everyday I am going to give myself a task. If people want they can give me ideas for tasks, they first task will be revealed today to be done tomorrow. Everyday I pass a task I'm going to put 1 pound in a jar, if pass every task then at the end of the holidays I should be up about fifty quid. Who knows, it may be so succesful I may carry on doing it afterwards!        &nbsp;    The First Task        &nbsp;    Tomorrow I will only be allowed to drink water (apart from milk on my cereal). Every morning when I get up I have a cup of tea, today my mum bought 12 cans of coke and 8 bottles of Yazoo Milkshake... will I be able to resist enough to complete the task? Find out tomorrow.        &nbsp;    PS: I will not be lying about the tasks, I will say if I have&nbsp;failed!

        Well today I had to catch a Yorkshire Traction bus to work, oh the joy! With the bus being every 2 hours it was packed with people, I couldn't hear myself think! I wish that the noise had covered up the smell though... Pee-ewww!       &nbsp;   Anyway luckily for me the bus journey only lasted 10 minutes and I was allowed to breathe the freshair of Doncaster again, did I say fresh? I just meant air, no freshness about it.       &nbsp;   Before work I decided to nip to Comet/Currys/PC World for a GBA game, Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario 3. I went to Comet first and looked at the selection, after not seeing the game I went to the counter and asked, he said he'd look. He typed something into the computer (I presume a Stock Check) and then proceeded to the games cabinet. At this point I thought I was lucky and that his stock check had found the game and he had proceeded to find it, however it seems it wasn't a stock check, or it was but after the failure he decided to look anyway, wasting a valuable 2 minutes of my time.       &nbsp;   Next I moved onto PC World but they're smacktards and don't stock Nintendo products so I then moved on to Curry's. I went to the GBA shelve to notice a nice BIG mess of games! I started scurrying through and eventually found my game, behind some old games. Now correct me if I'm wrong but shouldn't new products be displayed in front of older ones? I know that kids mess them up but most shops (at the end of the day) tidy their shelves up, putting things in the correct place, however I'm obviously wrong. So after the 5 minute search I made my way to the till where an old couple were having a laugh with the sales assistant, "Great!" I thought to myself... After a 5 minute wait I was finally served. I gave the assistant the empty case and she walked all the way to the otherside of the shop to get the game out of a room.       &nbsp;   Anyway after leaving I couldnt go and get any dinner otherwise I'd be late for work so I proceded straight to work, hungry as a hippo.       &nbsp;   It was&nbsp;3 o'clock and I was very happy as I only had an hour left and nothing had stressed me out. 40 minutes on the bell rung and I went to the desk, Ben told me two young lads had entered the shop and they were little shits so I had to keep my eye on them. Well turns out they weren't little shits, they were annoying little shits! Question after Question after Question! And then one of them touched me so I stupidly said "Don't touch me," and guess what, they kept touching me, so I began to walk off, they followed. I've never wanted to kick a 9 year old in the teeth more.       &nbsp;   I could have cried when my shift finished...

        Day 12, 8:47pm: James has just left the living area to go to the bedroom to sleep, for the past eleven nights this is what he has been doing...        &nbsp;    ...Oh what a bore I'd be on Big Brother, you see I enjoy my sleep just a little bit too much and I tend to wake up around 8am. If I went on BB I'd probably be voted out in week 6, the reason I'd survive the first 6 weeks is because I'd probably be a bit quiet and it'd take me a while to become myself, week 5 I'd start arguing, week 6 I'd be leaving to a vast amount of boos, but it would be worth it to meet the lovely Davina McCall. But would I leave to boos??? I mean I do tend to argue but would I be arguing in the right?        &nbsp;    The reason arguments occur is because two people have a disagreement, 8 times out of 10 one of the arguees is in the&nbsp;right, the other in the&nbsp;wrong but the people arguing only argue because they believe they're in the right... it's a bit strange, only the viewers of the argument can come to a decision, but usually tend to keep it to themselves because if two of the viewers said Mr A was right and 2 said Mr B was right then we've got ourselves another argument... now I'm probably talking jargon at the moment but my fingers are doing the talking!        &nbsp;    Anyway I'm off to bed now, I hope I ever a better sleep than last night. I couldn't get to sleep at all, at about 11:30 I had what could only be referred to as a "sneezing fit." I think I sneezed about 6 times continuous, I felt proper lightheaded. Anyhoot I'm going to bed.       &nbsp;   Night Night, Sleep Tight, Hope the Bed Bugs don't bite ya little toe off!

        For many normal people the phrase "Three Day Weekend," means YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY! However for me it means I'm working three days running. Turns out one of my fellow staff members is messing the company around and therefore they require people to work overtime.       &nbsp;   With the bus drivers being smacktards at the moment I used this as an excuse of not being able to do any overtime, however one of my fellow Woodlanders is able to get there via the Yorkshire Traction buses and so they know I'm able to do the same :(.        &nbsp;   So my mission tonight is to become diseased with something so if anyones got a new virus feel free to pass it this way, maybe i shud eat some frozen roast potatoes, can't be too good for the old stomach.       &nbsp;   Anyway tonight I plan on chatting with some mates and going to bed at about 9ish, I got up at 9 this morning, was working at half past, whoooooops!

         What will you be doing tomorrow?         &nbsp;    Tommorow I will be doing a 7 and a half hour day, this meaning ham sandwiches instead of a Sunday Dinner :(. This is how my life has been for the past 9 months, ever since I began working at Pets at Home.        &nbsp;     Why're you posting this Blog now?         &nbsp;    I'm posting this Blog before I go to bed, as tomorrow I&nbsp;will&nbsp;be utterley bored and possibly stressed. However I've found a way to manage stress at work, its called kicking the fridge, fun little game, highly recommended! What you do is make sure there's no-one in the staffroom, walk in, go over to the fridge, swing your leg back, think of the person who's stressed you out and swing your leg forward! Oh the joys, it doesn't hurt, nothing gets damaged and you feel better, even though it is a bit sad :.        &nbsp;     What is the biggest cause of Stress at work?           &nbsp;    When I walk into the office and the manager gives me a till to cash up and I ask the question "Am I on the till all day?" and the reply is "Yes." Last week I actually pleaded with the manager for me to not go on the till but I got a "It's your job!" Yes it is my job, it's also the other 4 staff members job but it seems they enjoy picking on me...        &nbsp;     How do you mean picking on you?           &nbsp;    In my first few weeks at work I was made to clean out the aviaries (probably the most difficult and time consuming job there). A few weeks later the same manager made me tidy the entire cat litter. She left and now she's back and I seem to be either a) on the till or b) doing the crap jobs like smartening all the bulk (15kg+) dog food.        &nbsp;     Don't you get a Sunday Dinner at all?           &nbsp;    Oh I get a Sunday dinner, but warmed up Sunday dinner, compared to fresh, might as well be monkey droppings. Mum's Sunday dinner used to be one of my favourite meals, now it's just boring and tastless.        &nbsp;     When will you be going to bed?           &nbsp;    Very soon... In fact, I'm fed up of this interview.        &nbsp;     Oh come on...           &nbsp;    STFU!!! I'm going to bed.        &nbsp;     Don't leave things like this James!           &nbsp;    If I were you, I'd get&nbsp;shut up&nbsp;before you see my angry side...        &nbsp;    JAMES LEAVES THE ROOM        &nbsp;     ARSEHOLE!           &nbsp;    JAMES ENTERS THE ROOM        &nbsp;    What did you say?        &nbsp;     Erm... Your feet smell like dasies...           &nbsp;    Thanks!        &nbsp;    JAMES LEAVES THE ROOM...

        Today I noticed a fine line between 2 things, which personally I didn't think would relate at all. The 2 things being Stupidity and Racism...        &nbsp;    Today at work I was catching a fish for a Random Couple when I told them the name... A Pakistani Loach. Now to people with an IQ over 40 this means that they originate or were found in/near Pakistan. However when I mentioned the name the lady replied with a SNIGGER and "What they called that for?" My first thought was "Is she racist?" because it was like saying they shouldn't be called Pakistani, but then I thought is she just plainly stupid? When I was about 3 I used to think that calling a coloured person a Pakistani was bad.        &nbsp;    After my little memory jog I then came to the question "Is she stupid?" Because she may have thought that Pakistani was a racist term...        &nbsp;    Anyway all in all my day at work sucked ass, as usual. One of the managers is about as stupid as a fly; some woman asked me if we sold parrots and I mentioned that we had 2 due for sale in the next three weeks (we keep them in the back for a while for some random reason). Anyway turns out they're under strict quarrantine and therefore no one is allowed to see them (except staff of course) so I asked my manager if I could use my phone to take a picture of them to show the woman. She started telling me that if we let customers near them they might have birds and give them a disease and yada yada yada, blahdy blahdy blah... YAWN! Anyway she gave me a five minute speech, in which I replied "So I'm not allowed to photo them because..."        &nbsp;    Oh well, I'm home now, as are my Mum and Dad who've just been to see my sister in Majorca. They had fun and gave me thirty quid because they couldn't find a pressie for me :D:D:D. I think I'm gonna buy a Gameboy Advance Game...

        Yesterday just happened to be full of stress for me, here's what happened...        &nbsp;    1AM: Not too much stress here, mainly a bit of partying at Andy G's house.        &nbsp;    2AM: The partying settled and we'd just put School of Rock in the DVD player. I went up the stairs to tell a crowd of people in a room we were watching a movie and was met by "Get Out," and "You're a ring piece." Drunks are sooooooo friendly. I went back downstairs to watch the movie hoping it would put me&nbsp;to sleep but it didn't :(.        &nbsp;    3:40AM: I was still not asleep, I seem to find it difficult to sleep in a room full of people, School of Rock had finished now and I was&nbsp;bored...        &nbsp;    3:50AM: Sam had put Dogma in the DVD player, after finding it quite boring Me, Sam and Becky had decided to go to the park...        &nbsp;    4AM: For the first time in my life I was&nbsp;on the Swings at 4AM in the morning!!! My back was killing and conversation with Becky and Sam was minimal (I think Becky was drunk and depressed&nbsp;:P)        &nbsp;    4:30AM: I decided to go back to the house, as I entered someone (who wasn't intending to sleep)&nbsp;was taking up the entire settee, leaving a very small space on the floor for me.        &nbsp;    5AM: I'd woken up after a small amount of sleep. People told me I'd been snoring making me very self-conscious, no more sleep.        &nbsp;    5AM to 7AM: NO IDEA what happened, definitely didn't sleep though, probably watched a movie...        &nbsp;    7AM - 11AM: People had started leaving, meaning only about 8 of us remained. Had some good talks with people though and watched some episodes of Fairly Odd Parents.&nbsp;At 11 I left with Andy D.        &nbsp;    11AM - 2PM: Was at Andy D's for most of the time, playing The Sims: Bustin Out on Andy's GBA emulator. Got quite far :D.        &nbsp;    2PMish: Just left the asda after a sandwich, phoned a taxi and had to wait 15 minutes. Buses have decided to go on strike you see...        &nbsp;    2:30PMish: Got home had a bath, not much stress. Watched some TV, went on the computer etc etc...        &nbsp;    4PM: Decided to go and get my sisters dog for a couple of hours. On the way back to mine she sniffed and pulled and sniffed and pulled and sniffed and pulled and sniffed and pulled and sniffed and pulled...        &nbsp;    4:30PM - 5:30PM: Tried to have a nap, however I was interuppted by my sisters fiancee and the phone, these only interrupting&nbsp;when I'd just DROPPED OFF!!        &nbsp;    6:10PM: Sister phones moaning about not having much time to pick the dog up (a hint saying "will you take her back PLEASE!)        &nbsp;    6:15PM: We decide to take my dog up to my sisters on the walk, as soon as we get off the drive my sisters dog runs in front of my dog, her lead catches the collar of my dog and opens it. Random D*ckface walks by trying to impress is GF and makes a smarmy comment, if I wasn't too busy watching Andy save my dogs LIFE then I might have heard what was said and belted the guy (good job because I'm not the toughest lad in the world and may have ended up with my face smashed on the floor). Andy saved my dogs life (THANK YOU), but I had to punish the dog by leaving him at home (shouldn't have run away ya see)        &nbsp;    That was the peak of my stress for the day, I'd had less than an hours sleep and I was knackered but managed to&nbsp;keep myself up to watch Big Brother, Will and Grace and Bo' Selecta. Went to bed and fell asleep watching Something About Mary.

        Well on tuesday we had a rather interesting day. I was supposed to write this blog yesterday but oh well... my bad. Anyway it started with flooding in cleethorpes, the place we'd planned to go for the day, so after changing our minds we decided to go to Meadowhall instead and see a movie.           The Movie... 13 going on 30. Not a bad movie to be honest, Jennifer Garner playing a pretty convincing 13 year old in a 30 year olds body. The best part of the movie had to be when at a party Thriller came on and everyone did the dance, it was PRO!          After the movie we did a bit of shopping, had some dinner and finally went to sit in our favourite place (the seating above the Oasis). We were sat there for a while but no one was up there and there were a lot of empty seats downstairs. We were just talking and reading some magazines, myself and becky decided to go and play the 2p machines in the arcade.           When we got back, the second we sat down a Security Guard came up to us. Being power crazy from the black tie he wore, and the clear earpiece, he began to get clever and said something along the lines of "Move or Get Out." I'm sorry fuck face, I don't see any "No loitering," signs. Well I should've said that but we were all a bit shocked of being told to move along.           There were only 4 of us and we weren't being loud or anything so there was no reason at all to move us. So, WE COMPLAINED! We wrote an official complaint and handed it in, I received a reply this morning saying that when loitering isn't allowed but the security should be more polite. So why don't they tell that 80 year old woman who's been sat in the same place for 10 hours to move? PREJUDIST! That's why.           Being 17 year old teenagers we fall into a stereotype in which we are trouble causers etc etc. When 80% of us aren't. Any hoot I can't think of any tasks lately, that's why I haven't been posting as much.           TTFN ppl!

        Last year for Media Studies coursework myself and my partner Kimberley Stirling made a trailer for a movie adaptation of a TV show that I'd written; The Cross (See the ninth task :P). Tonight I have decided to begin pre-production for the sequel trailer. Two or Three will be made, one being a Teaser Trailer and the other 2 Theatrical Trailers. This isn't coursework just something that I love doing and I hope that Kim will be on board again because her help as a vital crew member and her additions were brilliant and we worked brilliantly as a team, getting not far from full marks for the project :-D! Here's a short Synopsis of The Cross, and The Cross 2.          The Cross          Many years ago 4 vampires stopped Warlocks from releasing a Mystical power that would give 4 teenagers from different corners of the Earth super powers. The powers were trapped in a steel tomb and dropped into the Indian Ocean. In present day the powers have been opened and 4 crossbearers have received the powers, including Daniel Labson, a 15 year old boy who has just moved to a new town, which just so happens to be the town in which the 4 vampires live...          The Cross 2          After his defeat over the Unholy 4, Daniel has been able to focus on both his school work and his social life, vampires in Doncaster have become a rarity. But not only are vampires evil... A masked menace has been stalking The Cross Bearer. Daniel knows of his stalker but doesn't understand his intentions, until he harms one of his closest friends.          Those are very basic plots, and the 2nd isn't a definite yet. If myself and Kim start production the second we get back to school I think we'll have 2-3 weeks of filming and 1-2 months of editing. Hopefully the original cast will be back, and hopefully the outtakes will be just as good. I'll keep yas informed :D

        Saw an ABSOLUTELY fabulous movie last night called Purely Belter. It's about to Geordie lads scheming to get 2 season tickets to a game! The plot isn't brilliant but the script is as strong as a bull and keeps you laughing at the PURE geordie humour!          I also watched The Ring last night! Thats a PRO movie, and I was just thinking about what makes a good horror movie, and I think it is real things. For Example: in The Ring it's about a video tape and a phone! They're everyday objects and thats why it makes it scary, the creepy dead people faces don't help!          I might do a post later, see how I feel. TTFN peeps!

        Well I've had a VERY different day at work. I spent about 2 and a half hours in a dog costume raising money for a Charity called Pals With Paws, Pals with Paws a part of a charity called Dogs for the disabled, here's the official site.    urlLink   http://www.dogsforthedisabled.org/      . Pals with Paws is my favourite charity because they train guidedogs to help disabled children, pretty nice people :).           Anyhoot with the weather being a bit "too" hot today I've been roasting my ass off in a dog costume! Was kind of funny though, I really slipped into the role! LOL. I was crying when kids were crying, I was scaring people from behind shelves and all the customers loved it! I kind of enjoyed it too, I got to piss about at work! Teehee. I raised £20 for Pals With Paws, giving me a personal total of over £250 now, which I'm very proud of.          Bad News about the task peeps, I gotta postpone it till Monday because I am knackered from work and believe I'll be just as knickyknackered tomorrow. Sorry!          TTFN: Jim

        I've decided to postpone todays task until tomorrow due to highly needed maintenence work required on my computer. Anyway I've done the maintenence and it STILL isn't shutting down properly. Pretty soon I'm just gonna have to leave it in constant standby to make sure my graphics card doesn't corrupt!          Tonight, as we all know, is the Big Brother 2004 final, in which we will see either Dan, Jason, Nadia or Shell be crowned King or Queen (Queen if Shell wins teehee) of Big Brother. What an interesting series we've had. 10 weeks ago myself and Andy sat in my living room and watched what seemed to be 12 utter weirdo's enter the house. From Kitten's entrance outburst and Marco's very annoying screaming every big brother fan knew that this year was going to be VERY different.          The first week was a week of rebellion in which we saw leader Kitten not conform to the rules of Big Brother, Big Brother retalliated and kicked her out on her fat ass, also dropping the new £100000 prize found by £9000 just for her insolence. Personaly I believed that with Kitten gone it wouldn't be very interesting anymore, but oh boy I was wrong:           Two words, The Bedsit. I do not believe I have laughed as much at Big Brother whilst Emma and Michelle were in the bedsit. Emma (The gal who shudda won Big Brother) was classic! Michelle mothered her throughout the bedsit and also added much needed comedy by talking to the camera slagging off Vanessa. From Victor's cold showers to the chilli cake and Marco saying "Big Brother, So Twisted," I was giggling my ASS off!          But what was to come could be considered one of the most intense nights in Big Brother, possibly television, history. On Day 20 Michelle and Emma were released from the bedsit and were allowed to go back into the Big Brother house. But the excitement was too much and all hell broke loose. Arguments became likely and began happening. Victor vs Emma, Jason vs Marco and Nadia, it must have been very frightening for the fellow housemates. After the arguments came trays being thrown between Emma and Victor almost resulting in the TV shows first ever fight. Thankfully Dan managed to calm the atmosphere and Emma was put back into the bedsit, eventually being given the boot.          Only 3 weeks in and we'd had more Brilliance from the show than ANY other series of the hit reality show. Anyway weeks went on and Big Brother was becoming VERY evil! Some tasks were fun but then came the Boot Camp task, giving Michelle and Jason a horrible task. They became sergeants and had to lead the privates into passing daily challenges, however if the privates passed they would be up for eviction, if they failed the sergeants would be. Only Michelle and Jason were allowed to know this information, but some housemates had ideas. Ahmed may not have had an idea but he was very jealous of Michelle being a sergeant over him. So jealous he faked illness... making Michelle very angry. Probably my favourite line from the series came from Michelle's mouth during a dispute. "What the fuck are you doing here?" Doesn't read that well but IMAGINE it in a geordie accent.          Well the weeks went on and now, Day 69, will see the best ever series of Big Brother end. I will be routing for Nadia tonight even though I have been thinking Jason has been a good housemate. I think he should come second! Anyway peeps I'll be blogging tomorrow!          TTFN, Jim

        Yes, yet again I failed my task giving me a 4:4 win:lose ratio. Todays task should be quite easy though. Take a look...          The Ninth Task          Today I will be writing Act 1 Scene 1 of a movie called The Cross. Because I have been working on the project over a year now I have a basic plot but have never written it in a movie format. I believe I will be able to pass this task and hopefully it will put my creative mind back into gear! Wish me luck peeps! :D

        Well I'm sorry peeps but I haven't done a task today... AGAIN! I will be doing one tomorrow though because I'm gonna put it on the end of this Blog.          Today on my driving lesson I drove right into town, over the new bridge :D:D:D. Well proud of myself, was A LOT easier than I expected!          I have begun a new adventure today as well, with 4 little creatures to accompany me. A Pidgey, a Caterpie, a Nidoran (Female), and a Charmander. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have begun Pokemon Blue!!! And that will be something to do with tomorrows task.          The Eighth Task          Tomorrow I will, by 6pm, have 20 pokemon owned and 40 pokemon seen! It should be very simple so there is a catch. At least 10 of my caught pokemon must have been on my team and be over level 20!!! It seems boring for you but very interesting for me :D

        All seemed well on Lane 5 for me last night. I had a bit of tough competition from Stee but I managed to overcome his beginners luck. After 2 strikes, 1 spare and a lot of high hits I came out with a pretty cool 113. I was very happy, this was one part of my task accomplished, the only part I could control, for the other part I could not, Lane 6 was my enemy...          The appropriately named Marshmallow Kimberley Anne Stirling seemed to be doing rather well, much to my taunts and boos. She was doing so well in fact it seemed that there was no way I could stop her victory. Anyway, after all was said and done Kim had beat me, BY 4 FUCKING POINTS!!! I was devestated, she'd only gone bowling the night before and got a pretty dim 50ish! I mean come on people, she had to be cheating. They had bumpers which kinda peed me off because if they didn't I would've pwned her ass. But I accept my defeat, and so the third fail occurred.          For those of you who are slightly interested here is the list of people and points (in order):          13: Daz, 38 points.     12: Fish, 39 points.     11: Drew, 68 points.     10: Hopper, 70 points.     9: Gemma, 75 points.     8: Anne-Marie, 78 points.     7: Jayne, 80 points.     6: Andy D, 83 points.     5: Phil, 84 points.     4: Becky, 85 points.     3: Steve, 99 points.     2: James (ME), 113 points.     1: Kim (BITCH), 117 points.          Love ya really kim :D          Anyways as you can see I OWNED all the other people, just seems I couldn't own kim      :(. Tomorrows task will be up tomorrow!

        I've decided upon tomorrow's task people. This is something I've wanted to do for ages but usually don't manage to do it. I've done it once or twice but tomorrow will be the only time that counts... Here it is.          The Seventh Task          Tomorrow my task will to be the top at bowling. I must win everyone else there. I usually come 2nd/3rd but have only ever come 1st a few times (And that was only an arcade bowling alley). HOPEFULLY I'm taking my camera (if i remember) so I may post some piccies on here, should be a good night. WISH ME LUCK :D

        The Recipe          Half a bottle of Yazoo Chocolate Milkshake     Cocopops     Milk     5 Tablespoons of virgin cola     2 tablespoons of vimto dilute     8 tablespoons of water     4 tablespoons of Oasis (Orange)          (Feel free to make it yourself and try it)          The Result          Well, there's the recipe and I can reveal that I will not pass the task. I have failed. It smelt like something able to injure a human, it tasted like something that would be used to kill rats! It was a random concoction and I didn't cheat by making a different one when I knew I couldn't do it. Sorry folks, thats 2 fails now :(. It looked like choccie milkshake.

        The Sixth Task          Well people I've decided that for my sixth task I will be making a concoction (a drink with loads of crap in it, and consuming it, I will be getting a witness in the form of an MSN buddy over my webcam). This task will be passed, or failed depending on whether I can drink at least 50% of the entire thing!
