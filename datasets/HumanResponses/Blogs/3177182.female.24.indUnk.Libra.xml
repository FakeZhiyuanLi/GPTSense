       urlLink         Rudolph Valentino!      While I am on the subject of favorites I have to talk about my favorite actor Rudolph Valentino.  Everyone asks me how did you get interested in a actor that has been dead since the mid 1920's.  When I was young my mom had a book on Hollywood stars and I remember seeing Valentino and thought he was very cool looking.  There was also a photo of his lying in his casket at his funeral.  I thought it was very strange/cool.  When I was about twenty I was up late watching AMC and they said coming up next The Sheik starring Rudolph Valentino.  I thought it would be cool to stay up and watch the movie and tape it for my mom.  As I was watching it I thought it was really interesting and it was so late that I feel asleep.  The next day I finished watching it and after that I was hooked.  I have all of his movies and a whole room downstairs full of Valentino collectibles. When most people see this room for the first time there is silence and then they slowly walk out and look at the rest of the house.  I am sure that most people think I am completely nuts or totally obsessed. Oh well whatever my collection is worth a lot of money and I enjoy collecting it.   Let me tell you a little about Valentino.  He was born on May 6, 1895 in Castellaneta, Italy.  His real "birth" name is Rodolfo Alfonzo Raffaelo Pierre Filibert Guglielmi di Valentina D'Antonguolla.  Say that fast five times.  Anyway he came from a modest family in Italy and deceided to travel to America when he was 18 in 1913.  He was adventurous and wanted to try a life in America.  He held many odd jobs and around the age of 20 he got a job as a dancer with a well known dancer named Bonnie Glass.  He was known simply as Signor Rodolfo.  During this time dancers were more popular than movie stars.  After his short dancing career he got a part in a play called Nobody Home which folded in San Franciso.  He met up with a actor named Norman Kerry who told him to try Hollywood.  He got Valentino a bit dancing part in a 1917 movie called Alimony.  He had various bit parts in various movies over the next three years.  Finally in 1920 he appeared in a movie called Eyes of Youth.  Hollywood's most powerful woman at the time, June Mathis saw the performance and convinced the studio to cast Valentino in the lead for the movie The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse.  The studios were first reluctant due to the fact that there had never been a "foreign" lead and they did not think the public would be favorable to it.  Later that year he landed another leading role in a movie called The Sheik.  He was a star overnight.  Women everywhere were crazy over Valentino.  He quickly became the first lover/sex symbol of the screen.  In 1922 on the set of the movie Camille he met the set designer, her name was Natasha Rambova.  They instantly fell in love and were married.  Unfortunately she controlled his life and his career.  She had a very strong power over him.  I feel that he truly loved her and was blind to what was going on around him.  Valentino was hot and studios wanted him, however Natasha demanded specific roles, scripts, you name it.  Valentino and the studios clashed and he walked out on his contract.  A year later he came back but in his contract it stated that Natasha was to have no involvement in any part of the production.  Valentino hesitantly agreed and soon after the marriage crumbled.  She left him and left for New York.  Valentino was heart broken.  He then began to live the life of a movie star, he dated, spent money and had extravagant parties. In 1926 he made a sequel to his blockbuster hit The Sheik, The Son of the Sheik.  He was promoting the movie in New York when he collapsed in his hotel room.  He was taked to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a perforated gastric ulcer and a infection.  He was in the hospital for 7 days where he slipped into a coma and died on August 23, 1926.    After his death was annoucned there was panic.  To this day there has never been such pandemonium take place after a celebrities death.  Women reportedly committed suicide.  There was a riot in the streets of New York at The Campbells Funeral home where Valentino was laid to rest.  The crowed rushed through the plate glass window in the front of the buliding to get a glipse of Valentino.  The next day the police on horseback contolled the crowd of over 100,000 people.  They allowed the public to view the open casket inside in a single file line.  He was later laid to rest in Hollywood Memorial Cemetery.  He is in a vault next to June Mathis, which she owned when he died.  After Valentino died Natasha did not attend the funeral, in his will he left her $1, and not one penny more.    One intersting fact about Valentino he holds the record for the shortest Hollywood marriage.  When he was younger before Natasha he married a co-star named Jean Acker.  They became close friends and in a whirl-wind relationship became married.  On their wedding night she locked him out of their hotel room.  Valentino was unaware that Jean Acker was a lesbian and there was a interlocutory divorce soon after.    I have been a fan/collector of Valentino for about tweleve years now.  If anyone out there is a collector or has some Valentino items you want to get rid of, be sure to let me know!  Check out the  urlLink Valetino Homepage .  This is the best Valentino webstie out there!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink       Funniest Scene in a movie ever!!      Honestly I have seen tens of thousands of movies and the funniest part of any movie I have ever seen is from the movie  urlLink Four Rooms .  The whole movie itself is O.K. however, the part of the movie where the Sam the bellhop played by Marc Lawrence watches Antonio Banderas's kids is absolutely hilarious.  I laughed so hard I cried.  You have to see it if you missed it.  Just watch that one part of the movie, the movie is four different stories!  Let's just say what is that smell?&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink      Ok, I have to start this off with my favorite movie of all time,  urlLink JFK .  Besides being a big movie buff I am also really into the Kennedy assassination.  So of course this movie is perfect for me.  I have done quite a bit of research on the JFK assassination and this movie is very accurate.  The movie is based on the life of Jim Garrison, who was the District Attorney of New Orleans when Kennedy was assassinated.  Since Lee Harvey Oswald had been linked to various people in New Orleans in the summer of 1963 Jim Garrison brought in a few of these people for questioning.  One of the people he brought in was David Ferrie.  David Ferrie had served in Oswald's Civil Air Patrol Unit years earlier.  They had remained acquaintances throughout the years.  After questioning Ferrie about the actual events of November 22nd 1963 and his known association with Lee Harvey Oswald he felt that Ferrie was making up his whereabouts.  He then turned Ferrie over to the F.B.I. for further questioning.  The F.B.I questioned Ferrie and then released him.  After releasing Ferrie the F.B.I. in a press conference announced that they had questioned a suspect named David Ferrie and that he had no connection to the case, they also stated that he had been brought into be questioned by the District of New Olreans Parrish not the F.B.I.  At the time Garrison had no idea why the F.B.I. released this suspect which he felt was closely timed to the case.  He got passed it and moved on with his life.  Three years later in a chance conversation with Senator Russell Long of Louisiana the JFK assassination came up again.  Senator Long told Garrison that the whole thing was a joke.  He told Garrison that it was absolutely impossible for Oswald to squeeze off three shots from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds from the sixth floor of a office buliding.  Long went on to say that he heard that Oswald was at best a medium shot from his training when he was in the U.S. Marines.    The conversation changed Jim's life from there on.  After now doubting some of the events that took place that day he meet up with his team that worked along side him everyday in New Orleans.  He told his team that they were going back into the case of the killing of the President.    The movie depicts Jim's trials and tribulations throughout this period.  Many people don't realize until seeing this movie that Jim Garrison was a patriot and a hero.  He put his career, his reputation and his family on the line to pursue the truth behind the assassination.  Without Jim Garrison's efforts we would not have a lot of the unexplained evidence that we have today.    The cinematography in this movie is absolutely unbelievable.  The movie uses a lot of quick camera movements and also black and white flash backs.  There are also a lot of scenes where various characters are planted that you have to keep your eyes open for.  The Cast:  I have never seen a movie before or one since that has the star power of JFK.  First off there were many real life people in the movie that were associated to the case.  Jim Garrison himself was in the movie, he played Chief Justice Earl Warren.  Also Perry Russo who was a key witness in the Clay Shaw trial and the man who restored the Zapruder film and JFK assassination researcher Robert Groden was in the film.  As far as Hollywood star power: Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Sissy Spacek, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, John Candy, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, Ed Asner, Donald Sutherland and Vincent D'Onofrio.    This is by far Kevin Costner's best performance.  He was nominated for the Acamdey Award for best actor.  However, he lost to Anthony Hopkins for his peroformance of Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs.  I feel that Costner definately gave the better performance that year but I felt that the controversial film lead to his loss.  The most pivotal part of Costner's performance was toward the end of the movie during the courtroom scene.  If you have not seen JFK go rent it buy it whatever.  Enjoy this fantastic movie on a very controversial subject and judge for yourself.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink     1&nbsp; urlLink          "Goodfellas and Sopranos"      urlLink     2&nbsp; urlLink       The Sopranos is one of my favorite television shows.  Goodfellas is one of my favorite movies.  I always see people in Sopranos that I recognize from Goodfellas.  When Princess of Power and I are watching The Sopranos I am always like "hey, he is from Goodfellas".  She is always like "yeah".  I think it is cool that the two gangster shows interact.  I have always wondered how many people from Goodfellas have appeared on The Sopranos.  Well fortunately after a little research I have the answer.  From 1999-2004 there have been a total of 21 actors and actresses that appeared in the movie Goodfellas and the show The Sopranos.  I know that now P.O.P. can tell me to shut the hell up about it because I finally know.  I have also compiled a list just to prove that the number 21 is accurate.  They are in no particular order.  I have listed the actor/actresses name, then their character name from Goodfellas and then their character name from Sopranos.  You can never have enough useful gangster/mob information!   1.	Tony Sirico – Tony Sacks / Paulie 'Walnuts' Gualtieri 2.	Vincent Pastore – Man with coat rack / Salvatore 'Big Pussy' Bonpensiero 3.	Michael Imperioli – Spider / Christopher Moltisanti 4.	Lorraine Bracco – Karen Hill / Dr Jennifer Melfi 5.	Tony Lip – Frankie the Wop / Carmine Lupertazzi Sr 6.	Suzanne Shephard – Karen’s Mother / Mary DeAngelis 7.	Tony Darrow-Sunny  Bunz / Larry Boy Barese 8.	Frank Vincent – Billy Bates / Phil Leotardo 9.	Frank Pellegrino - Johnny Dio / Bureau Chief Frank Cubitoso 10.	Tobin Bell - Parole Officer / Major Zwingli 11.	Paul Herman – Dealer / Beansie Gaeta 12.	Frank Albanese - Mob Lawyer / Uncle Pat Blundetto 13.	Victor Colicchio - Henry's '60s Crew / Joe 14.

        Who else thinks it's completely great and utterly lazy to have a Krispy Kreme drive-thru?  The other day while feeding the compulsive shopping monster that lives inside me, I happened upon Krispy Kreme.  I thought, "I could just go through the drive-thru real quick like and get an Original Glazed and a Dean's chocolate milk."  Coming from a disparing-skirt-trying-on session, this seemed to be just the cure.  As I was furiously searching for the $2.17 I needed to pay for my .45 seconds of pure food heaven I thought this is completely lazy/great.  I also felt like a lard ass.  It was great.  Long Live Krispy Kreme.

       Presidential Candidates who could not win a high school debate - part one   As those who know me well should know, there are few things that light my fire of interest like the sparks of a presidential campaign.  With the November fifth date less than a half year away the torrential tides of political propaganda are saturating the shores.  The overwhelming responsibility of the American people is to sift through the sand of misrepresentations, misstatements and mendacity in search of any remaining grains of non-partisan truth.  In order to assist the blog readers in this tedious task I will make it the goal of my writings to right the wrongs of the partisan press.  The democrats ('de-m&-"krat), are once again being led by a Roman Catholic liberal from Massachusetts with the popular initials J.F.K., but don't get your hopes up, the comparisons quickly dwindle.  Is John F. Kerry the John F. Kennedy of our generation? I vote no.  With a consistent record of inconsistencies in public policy opinions, Kerry's semantics are already wearing on the I-won't-vote-for-you-just-because-you-are-a-democrat crowd.  Kerry is known in Republican circles as a "flip flop" and that has nothing to do with his manner of dress (though that also could stand a bit of scrutiny), or a particular affinity for pool-shoes.  He was issued this good-humored nickname as a result of his inability to make up his mind on key issues.  He wanted our troops in our Iraq, and yet he does not want to provide the funding necessary to complete the mission which he VOTED to begin.  He appears very proud of his service in Vietnam, and yet he finds himself in a middle school fight about the difference in the definitions of ribbons and medals.   It may sound as if I would be singing the praises of the president, and advocating his re-election, but the truth is that there are thousands of things that threaten the country and the country's stability if we choose to travel that path as well.  What is the answer? I will proudly post that as soon as I figure it out.  Until then, I will tackle the tough topics on the blog, beginning next time with the issues of the Bush campaign. Until then, please elect to keep up with the election details, you can't expect me to do all of the work for you!

      Chris Rock  I just watched the new Chris Rock HBO special  Never Scared .  IT IS HILARIOUS.  One part he talks about how the US Government hates rap music.  To surmise: he states that if you want to kill a rapper, go ahead, cause they won't look for you.  He said the US Government found Saddam Hussein in a hole in Iraq, but that can't find who killed Tupac on the Las Vegas strip.  I was crying I was laughing so hard.  It's true.   urlLink He speaks the hilarious truth about racism, relationships, rap music. And doughnuts. Namely Krispy Kreme doughnuts, which are so deliciously addictive, he declares, "if I told you right now they had crack in it, you'd say, 'I KNEW something was up!'"

      I'm ticklish.  Very ticklish.  At my new place of employment, I was recently chastized for being this way.  At the Spag-o, they seem to have a shrunken personal space issue.  Bumping into people is one thing, just touching them because you think you can is quite another.  Many of my fellow employees feel a compulsion to randomly jab, poke, pinch, stroke, and generally fondle one another during work hours.  Now don't get me wrong I'm no prude, I'm just not that touchy of a person...maybe I didn't get enough hugs as a youth or something!  Whatever the reason, I'm not a stranger-toucher, or even an acquaintence-toucher.  What bugs me is the touchers who violate the weary touchees and then get all offended when the touchee seems a bit alarmed.  Am I crazy?  Well, yeah, but this touching has got to stop!

      I attending my first kickboxing class this evening.  I have absolutely no Rhythm.  I looked like the whitest person there, when in fact the entire class happened to be white.  I guess the combination of kicking and punching just takes practice but I think if I had some GD Rhythm I wouldn't look so fish out of water.  Oh well - I am going back Thursday.    Can one purchase Rhythm on eBay?  I do enjoy the refreshing new Gatorade Pink Lemonade afterward.

      Men with long nails  Men with long nails are repulsive.  Especially when it looks like they file them to a point.  Especially when they come to the FR Desk.  It's like a creature of sorts.  What's really grand is when the nails are filthy.  I go out of my way to avoid touching these sorts of hands.  I wonder if they use these fingernails for snorting coke, like in movies.    Even more merit in my hands-off approach.

      Hello all!  Its the Donald of Gold here, at least in the eyes of one Tom "Dangerfield" Miller!  Closing out this hellish week with my numero uno blog entry is quite exciting, although I seem to be at a loss for something clever to say...?    Instead of whipping up a tale of full of cockamamie stories and dripping with wit, I will simply speak freely on the subject closest to my heart at the moment....people who think their shit don't stink.  These people roam freely about the land, yet none so obnoxiously as a man child I know who calls himself Phil.  To begin, unless it is preceded immediately by Punxsutawney, Phil is the worst name ever.  Name one decent person named Phil....alright, well I'm sure there is one, but until he kicks it, NO ONE else should go by that name (No, Donahue doesn't count).  Anyway, this guy Phil is so full of crap its coming out his eyeballs, yet he thinks he's God's chunky, curly headed, white gift to the world.  He is not.  He is one of those people who uses big words erroneously (much love Mr. Gere) and then repeats them over and over in conversation, has pauses where they are not necessary, and has no idea when he is having body odor issues.  But the thing that really irks me about this mofo is his compulsion to sneer at my palm pilot keyboard.  He, of course, is also the proud owner of a Palm, (one without a color screen I noted last time I spied him playing 2-tone solitaire) but he has no keyboard.  I know that most people, me included, consider the owners of Palm keyboards in the upper echelon of society, but this kid says to me a while ago "I was gonna get one of those but then I thought it might be kind of dumb."  What??  Yeah, those are the kind of people that drive me to drink...well, them and everyone else I encounter in life haha...jj!    OK, as I must venture back to the almost-finished world of college, I will end this, my very first blog entry.  While I never intended it to be this way, I'm sure Ol' Phil would be pleased as pie to see that I gave him so much page space in this entry....if you see him, go ahead and tell him, he will surely suprise you with a biting reply.  Big ups to my soul sister Audra for getting our asses in gear on the blog!  L. Von Hatty's Question of the Blog 4.23.04 - Can you lick your elbow?  Yeah, I didn't think so!!

      Black Thorn Pub  Ok last night we went out to Black Thorn Pub, which was recently named a top place for deep dish pizzas in STL.  We had a few drinks, listened to $5.00 worth of jukebox and still didn't have our damn pizza.    A nice beer buzz was starting to give way to food-depraved anger.  It didn't help that the bartender was a complete b about it.    Eventually we got the pizza, AFTER 2 HOURS and we each only had 2 pieces since we were full of drink.  All and all it was ok but the pizza sure wasn't worth A 2 HOUR WAIT.  My advice is call ahead if you want a gd pizza before Christmas.

       "We Built This City": Worst Song Ever   urlLink At least that's the conclusion Blender came to when compiling the worst singles of all time. I can't say I disagree. "Achy Breaky Heart", "Everybody Have Fun Tonight", "Rollin'" and "Ice Ice Baby" round out the top five.    That is hilarious.  I guess the CB radio talk in the middle of the song really pushes it to the far side of  urlLink Worst Song Ever .  I kinda like it though....it makes me want to wear a trucker hat when I hear it.   Although I have to disagree with number 5, Ice Ice Baby as  urlLink Mr. Frick  can rock that out at Carson's.  Also from that article:    The May issue, a sequel to the 2003 roundup of history's worst bands, coincides with a Blender/VH1 special, The 50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever, which airs May 12.  Harvesting clunkers that range from The Doors' The End to Aqua's Barbie Girl entailed more digging than expected.   Now I love the Barbie Girl song.  I love both the English & German version.    Don't you love when you are singing  REALLY LOUD  to your Winamp and then your computer randomly pauses the song and you are left belting out Sunday Morning by No Doubt?  I have homework, damnit.

       Over one billion served   So last night we cruise into McDonald's around 2am.  We order 2 hamburgers, a #4 and a double cheeseburger.  We get up to the food pickup window and the employee chirps, " Have a good night! " and hands over the bag.  We (smartly) check the bag to find only the 2 hamburgers and a ginormous fry.  B raps on the window, muttering, " Double checked for accuracy...I don't think so. "  It was funny.  Maybe the martinis made it funnier.  More on that later.

       Daddy   I love that here in Missouri, we have billboards that show a picture of a cheerful, fatherless baby and flash the number: 1800-877-DNA or something like that, asking: Who's my Daddy?  Is paternity such an issue here that we need this service advertised on the interstates?  It's a funny to think that there all these women that are easy like Sunday morning.  I wonder if they have these lining the highways of the Bible Belt?

       This One's for the Children:   Lesson 1, The Special Needs Child    For those not in the education field, let me enlighten you. Each student that is diagnosed (medically) with a disability must have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). It outlines goals, deadlines, and accommodations that MUST be performed in the classroom. This is a legal document and failure to follow it could result in (you guessed it) legal action against the teachers. Now, let me take you back a few months to when I was still student teaching... A student in homeroom is misbehaving right before the bell rings for end of the day dismissal. The bell (finally) rings and the "real" teacher who I am working with starts talking to me. Her: He's a special kid. (Then proceeds to tell me about the other times she has had him in class and he's misbehaved and how his accommodations are outrageous, and she didn't follow him.) Me: Were these things the IEP outlined? Her: Yes. Me: Oh, well, what is he diagnosed with? Her: I don't know. They didn't tell me. Me: (trying to feign innocence) It wasn't on the IEP? Her: No, they didn't show me that part.  THAT IS UTTERLY AND COMPLETELY WRONG!! THE DISABILITY IS WRITTEN TO TOP OF THE IEP!! WHAT'S THE POINT IN HAVING AN IEP IF NO ONE KNOW WHAT MEDICAL CONDITION THE STUDENT HAS!?!?!? Just an example of why I'm not teaching. I cannot be around people who don't do their job. A teacher who does not follow an IEP is not doing their job.  (side note: any special educators out there that know more about the IEP process and discover that my findings are wrong....please let me know. I would hate to hold a mental grudge against that teacher when I there is no need).  I'm usually not that angry. However, the discovery that I've wasted 3 years of my life does tend to get under my collar.

       The Swan   Ok I resisted the temptation to watch The Swan but gave in yesterday since it was on while I was at el gymnasio.  I went into the locker room (it has a couple tv's in it) and found a bunch of women crowded around watching it.  Now most of the finalists turned out beautifully, as would anyone with extreme plastic surgery and professional makeup, but these women in the locker room were like, "Look at her hips!" and "She doesn't look that much different!" It was hysterically catty.  What was funnier is that no one moved, as much as they complained.  Well when I got home it was STILL on so of course I had to see who won.  I began complaining to B about how degrading this show was and blah blah blah.  I concluded my rant by surmising that while it was all of these things I would do it if given the chance!  I am a makeover slut in a way I guess.

       Harley Davidson   Why is it that people who ride Harley Davidson motorcycles also stick Harley Davidson stickers all over their other vehicles?  As I was driving home today I noticed several cars, some minivans actually, adorned with the HD stickers as if to shout: I am a rebel, even though you see me driving a minivan.    Additionally, HD fans don't just have one sticker.  They usually have two or three, plus the occasional HD jacket slung over the passenger seat.  I assume the coat is to put on when going into the grocery store, to show your inner rebel in the produce section?

       urlLink     Dream Library   I had a dream that I was working undercover in a department store, where incidentally, I lived.  I was walking around investigating something and I decided to stop and at a counter and rifle through the drawers.  Voila! I found what I was looking for: My Little Pony certificates of recognition.  I proceeded to write these out, honoring some of my family members.  L was suddenly following me around asking what pony she was going to get.  I finally had to yell at her in and say, "I don't know!"    Then suddenly I was in the living room from the Wonder Years with B and we were watching King of Queens.    I blame the late food/no sleep combo for this madness. Damn you  urlLink pancakes !&nbsp; urlLink

       Thank God for the light   Shortly after my last post, I woke  urlLink B  up because I found out that the  urlLink sunrise  was happening at 4:44am this morning and we should watch it.   urlLink B  was very confused because I had woke him several times previous to this out of complete mental terror.  So this time, he fully woke and we went outside to watch the sun come up.  It was strangely void of people noise but heavy on the nature sounds.  I thought to myself, this is why I don't camp.  It's too damn loud.    In the driveway I told  urlLink B  of my fear of Silas and we talked about trout fishing.  He concluded that perhaps my sun information was not in CST and it meant 5:44.  The sky was lightening up but no actual sun to be seen.  We decided that we were starved so we went to the grocery store to get stuff for breakfast.    The grocery store at 5:00am is kind of a mess.  There were boxes laying around and scary convict looking cashiers in the front.  We got what we needed and headed out to watch the sunrise and read the Sunday paper.  Very quaint I know.  Well the sun was masked by the damn clouds so we didn't technically see it after all this work but I am now informed about the deseg issues in the Clayton school district (thank you Bill McClellan.)    We went home and  urlLink B  made pancakes and snausages.  It was great, filling the void that the crab rangoon had left.  We washed the dishes and went back to bed.  I got up about an hour ago.    It's going to be a bitch getting up for work tomorrow.  My sunburn hurts.

       Scared Insomnia   Ok - it's 4:23 in the morning.  I can't sleep.  I did continue The Da Vinci Code.  I lied earlier - I was on page 32.  Now I am on page 134.  It is completely fucking riveting.  I can't put the book down.  The chapters describing Silas are scary while the chapters with the main characters, thus far are nail-biting.    I am having trouble sleeping for 2 reasons: 1.  I am starved.  Damn you chinese food! and 2.  My mind is drawing up Silas in the novel, as the character that symbolized the devil, skulking around in The Passion of the Christ.  The character was so disturbing that I had to put it out of my head straight away after viewing that movie.  Now our author, Mr. Brown, has resurrected (nice use of the word) this horrible thing in my head as Silas.    I was hoping that a good blogging would be cathartic.    What time does the sun come up?  Maybe I should go to the gym - it is 24 hours you know.  Oh Jesus - the cat is making the duster her bitch again.

       The Da Vinci Code   I finally got my hands on The Da Vinci Code - thank you B.  I am about 50 pages into it and so far so good. Has there been a bad review of this book?  Not that I can find.  I am supposed to be cleaning my office.  I think B is asleep on the couch with the giant Twilight Zone dvd eye staring at him.  This is what happens when you sleep till one pm on a pretty Saturday - you are up till 2am.    Oh God - B just woke up and acted as though he hadn't been sleeping with the giant psycho peeper watching him.  I think I will read a little before sleep.

        The Magical World of Tivo!!     I feel that Tivo is the most undiscovered miracle to come around in a long time.  We have had Tivo for about three months now and it is absolutely scrumtralesant.  All of your favorite T.V. shows at your fingertips at all times.  Set it to tape one show or a season pass which tapes the whole season.  You can even set it to tape everything that one specific actor appears in.  You can pause it, fast forward it or instant replay it.  After using Tivo you tend to look at your blank VHS tapes as if they were 8-tracks.  What in the hell did we do in our life before Tivo, or as my dad refers to it -  "Tibo."   One of the funniest things about Tivo is trying to explain it to someone who does not have it or has never used it.  They always ask what is the big deal?  How does it work?  When you start to explain it to them in detail and explain that you can pause live T.V. if you want, they become disoriented.  They look at your Tivo and its remote as if they were  urlLink Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer  looking at a cell phone for the first time.   "This Tivo is very strange to me I don't understand you making the T.V. stop."   It's like magic to them and they want to know how and when they can get their own.  It is as if they woke up and Hagrid is taking them shopping in Daigon Alley.  In conclusion I feel a bit brain washed since owning my Tivo.  I find myself explaining the magical world of Tivo to everyone I get a chance to.  Gotta go to make sure my SNL season pass is set!

       urlLink    So I was in a tanning bed for the first time this season.  I get in the kind of bed that has the fan at the bottom, where your feet go.  So I sneeze.  Since you have to sit up to sneeze I nearly clocked myself on the roof of the bed.  As I sneezed, it promptly flew into the fan and back all over me.  This was great (read: not funny) but I thought of my dear blog and how aptly titled it is.  Shalom.

       Getting a job   So you want a job somewhere - you apply and on your resume, naturally you put your email address.

       Chicken   So B goes to the grocery store to get chicken for dinner and goes to the fresh meat counter.  He tells the butcher that he wants x amount of chicken breasts.  The butcher goes to get the chicken and starts picking the small ones and B says something like, "No I want the big ones" and the butcher says, "what" and Brad says, "I want the big breasts" which was funny in itself.  So the butcher replies, "It's ok, I like big titties too."  Chicken titties...pass it on.

       Last names   Why do people address people by their entire name?  Say for example, your coworker is Jane Smith.  You have known Jane Smith for years but a superior in the office continues to refer to Jane as Jane Smith every time she is brought up.  AS though you couldn't possibly know who Jane was without her surname.  This drives me totally nuts.

I think that while I love to talk and talk I try to be discreet about who I bore to tears with the stories of my life.

       My not so Secret    Well I made it to the gym so now I am only carrying around chips and salsa from Hacienda.  Better than the mudega.    The dog just ate a cotton ball...almost.    Oh after the gym we hit the mall in search of underwear.  I like the word underwear - not panties.  I refuse that word.  It's completely gross.  What I like better is drawers.  Anyway it ended up that I had to go to Victoria's Secret - which I despise.  I like their stuff, but I can't stand their employees.  As B pointed out, I think you have to be an uppity bitch to work there.  For chrissake, you are pulling in $5.25 and hour to sort out briefs, thongs and bikinis.  Anyway I had to drop $29.50 for 3 pairs of drawers.  Insane.  The other thing I can't stand there is that they have no bra sizes for anything bigger than a 34C.  Why is this?  I know I am not the only person bigger than that.    Sorry if you work with me and read this; now you know about my drawers.  Moonlight Sonata just came on.  Maybe I will relax now.

I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was in bed; I took up a poker And threw it at his head.  Now this is from a Richard Scarry book of our youth.  Scarry is f-ing right.

       Post Prince Reaction   Well there is nothing like a concert high.  The Prince concert was great last night.  Although I didn't know about 40% of the songs it was still a good time!  He didn't sing Diamonds & Pearls though which was slightly disappointing.  Or When Doves Cry, now that I think about it!  This concert enabled me to partake in some serious people watching.  There were some freaks there last night.  Some people were dressed like it was prom, some like it was 1982 and others like Prince himself.  The great thing about it is that no one cared!  What peeves me about concerts is when artists let the entire crowd sing, instead of themselves.  I didn't pay $75 to listen to a crazy crowd sing, I paid to hear you Joe Artist!  This happened at my  urlLink Jordan Knight  extravaganza, the  urlLink Clay Aiken/Kelly Clarkson  concert and last night at Prince.  Usually this happens for the chorus, the best part of the songs!  I think maybe once or twice in a 2 hour concert would be ok but for the love of God is this necessary in every song?

      Debacle  Tomorrow we are going to see Prince in concert.  I desperately looked for something to wear (as if Prince will see me) but hey it was an excuse to shop.  Anyway - I went to like 3 stores and came up with a whole lotta nothing.  How could I go to my beloved Marshalls and not find a single suitable article of clothing you ask?    I attribute it to my recent goings to the gym and eating a little better.  It seems that this is making me larger.  And I don't mean this in a good way, for those of you who   insist   that being skinny is  so hard .    Ergo, I came home and had more toast.    GD Clothing Industry.

       Target: If you stock T.P. for 3 hours, we will give you a free bottle of overpriced shampoo   I have recently become employed by the discount retailer Target.  It has come to my attention in this short time that accepting this position is likely to be counterproductive to my goal of saving money.  I think that it is all part of the Target master plan, and it is brilliant.    Plan Plank One: HIRING - Target hires employess from all walks of life. They range in age, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation and intelligence, however they all possess one common trait.  They are all BROKE, or at least I assume that they are. Otherwise, why in God's name would they be stocking one-ply toilet paper for 8 hours?    Plan Plank Two: WAGE - Pay your employess as little as you can manage without risking their declinig the position.  When filling out applications, allow prospective employees to choose from one of three pay ranges.  No matter which pay range they choose, call them in for an interview.  They will be so excited about having an interview that they will take the job even after you break the bad news that they will be paid from the first, and lowest, pay bracket  Plan Plank Three: THE DISCOUNT - At the beginning of the orientation, discuss with new team members the discount you will be offering them.  After four long hours of disseminating ridiculous company information to your now sleeping employees, whisper to them that the discount is just 10%.  Wake them up.  Plan Plank Four: TURN THEM LOOSE - Ensuring that the employees remember that they get a discount (but never again mentioning the amount) turn them loose on the sales floor.  Happily watch them gather the merchandise that they are going to purchase on their breaks and lunch.  Laugh your best evil laugh as you watch them spend more than they will make.  And this, ladies and gentlemen, is how Target actually makes money off of their employees.  Their labor costs are at 0.  But who is complaining?  If they had to pay people to work how could they continue to bring us new products, like Biolage', which I spent 3 hours worth of pay to buy.

      Wild Turkey  This morning while driving to work I saw a wild turkey on the side of the road.  It was watching the cars go by.

Yesterday I was transported back to the horror of middle & high school when I came across scary (older) naked women just doing their thing in the buff.    Naturally this occurred in the locker room (gutter minds).  I am just so scared by this.  Maybe if I didn't have so many hangups it would be ok  - but probably not.  I think I was scarred by my 6-8th grade P.E. teacher, Ms. Hoskins.  Emphasis on the  Ms. .  She made us take showers after 25 minutes of throwing a volleyball back and forth.  Was this necessary?  What, in life, did this prepare you for?  Uncomfortable nude situations?  I have only had a few of those and I didn't feel too prepared by my few years of forced showering in school.    As you may or may not notice, I still have a few issues regarding this.  Too bad there were no blogs to speak of in 6th grade.

       Toast   I love it.  I have eaten 6 pieces already this afternoon.  That is bad.  Maybe that is why I am not seeing the gym results I want.   GD Toast

      So I get home from work today and it seems I had left the garage door open.  This is no good.  So I call B at work and ask what I should do.  He smartly advised me to go to the backyard and pick up Mackey, our miniature daschund, and let him go onto the house before me.  I do this, completely confusing Mackey, who is going apeshit now.    Since I am typing this now, you can assume that the coast is clear and the house is under control.  While talking to my sister she exclaimed, "mini daschund to the rescue!"  which struck me hilarious.    What was more funny was this Google search:  urlLink FLY

      Lunch Scenario:  Let's say you have a healthy turkey sandwich  on wheat , but then you have to  have  to have fries (the menu dictates it.)  What is the correct answer?   a.  The turkey sandwich cancels out the fries. b.  The fries cancel out the turkey sandwich.  c.  The best choice would have been to just eat the turkey sandwich, lard ass. d.  They cancel each other out - after all it  was  wheat bread. e.  You are going to the gym anyway - you should have eaten Pat's fries too!

      Jacked  Today some man, presumably a hotel guest was JACKED out in front of my work building.  This was at 8AM!  Who robs people at 8AM?  Anyway it seems the  perp , who naturally got away JACKED this guy for $500.  Now I hate to keep asking questions but who carries $500 cash on their person when they are staying in the hood?    Speaking of hood, I looked up the word at dictionary.com and found this:  hood3 or 'hood  n. Slang  A neighborhood, usually in the inner city. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ [African American Vernacular English, short for neighborhood.]  I thought this was hilarious.

       The Gym    I have been going to the gym for about 1.5 weeks now.  I am dedicated to this endeavor, yet I am not seeing any results.  To my complete horror I stepped on the GD scale and had gained nearly 5 pounds.  What is the meaning of this?  All those steps (literally) I had taken to watch what I ate and then run it off, all for additional bulk?  GD Peach Martinis

       Oh RH   So another coworker appeared from her cube today with a white cream smeared over various parts of her face and head.  It looked like tribal war paint.  I dared not ask what the hell the cream was and why she had greased up her melon head at work.    Finally, someone asked and she stated that she had "burned her head with a perm."  Oh of course.

       Oh Dick!   This is hilarious, taken from cnn.com:  Cheney's use of the "F" word not the first time a politician has been called a "potty mouth."  and this taken from msn.com  These days, when we think Mariah Carey, two things come to mind: the craptacular cinematic experience that was "Glitter" (along with the post-release meltdown it triggered) and wide open expanses of cleavage.   and finally this bit of hilarity:  In an interview with ABC's "Primetime Thursday," Carnie Wilson opens up about the depression she suffered after the band broke up. "I moved into the bong," she explains. "I moved into my bong and just got stoned every minute. I did."   Despite Carnie going several tokes over the line, bandmate Chynna Phillips, who initiated the split, has no regrets.   1.  I think the fact that we are still talking about Cheney telling a senator to fuck off is great and hilarious and indicative of what is  really  important in Washington. 2.  The word craptacular is splendid and should be introduced into your vocabulary right now! 3.  Have we not heard enough about Carnie Wilson for the love of God?  Additionally, at the time I don't think she would have fit "into the bong."

       Oh RH   I am assuming that many of my coworkers from RH woke up this morning with quite a doozy of a hangover.  Especially the  O bnoxious  A ss as AW put it.  Some people are completely out of control outside of work - sides we never see even after spending upwards of 160 hours per month with them.  Let me now recount some of the more memorable events of last night:   1.  Standing sideways for 90 minutes in the pew waiting for the receiving line to get on with it.  I can only assume that people were giving their life stories to the happy couple.    2.  Exploring the Magic House on Susie Joann Marsha Lane.    3.  The O.A. trying to force a large baggie of dog food onto a guest.  4.  One director telling a story about how she can't stand to look at her coworkers in lycra biking clothes for one more minute.    5.  The O.A. becoming so excited that she spewed crackers from her mouth, all over the place, causing B to run for cover.  6.  When a "special guest" made an appearance at the reception.    7.  When The O.A. attacked the Asian Werewolf, smashing his head into her chest.  Great photos.    8.  Finally, when the O.A. started drinking my vino, then back to hers, then back to mine, unbeknownst to her.    The wedding was fun.  You get to see the real side of people I think.  Or at least the intoxicated side, which is usually better than the real side.      Back to homework.

       My Girl Fridays   Fridays are generally days for me.  B usually closes and I come home and watch what I call girl tv.  Or girl movies.  Tonight I watched What a Girl Wants with Amanda Bynes, Colin Firth and Kelly Preston.  I love it!  It was a perfect girl movie and I can't believe I waited this long to watch it.    Not much else to blog about - tomorrow we are going to a wedding of a coworker.    I wish I was English.  Sigh.

       On every corner   Constantly people call in to their place of employment and say they are going to be an hour or so late because they  are going to have a prescription filled.   Now - I have filled prescriptions at 3 in the morning before.  There is a Walgreens on EVERY CORNER, most which boast a 24 hour pharmacy.  Why is it only when it's time to go to work, you suddenly need these scripts filled?  Peculiar.

       Commercials   There are two new commercials that are the worst:  Hamburger Helper:  the new Hamburger Helper man has this ridiculous voice.  He sounds like a little girl.    Pepto Bismol: This new commercial is ridiculous - have you seen it?  There is a line of people waiting for a copier that bust out in this song, grabbing the appropriate body parts as the song plays on:   Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea, yay Pepto Bismol! I love the little dance. C'mon everybody now! Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea, yay Pepto Bismol!  For further research I went to the Pepto Bismol website and found this in the FAQ's:  How do I open the bottles of Pepto-Bismol Liquid?  TO OPEN: Lightly squeeze both tabs located on each side of the neck of the package and turn the cap at the SAME time. TO CLOSE: Screw the cap back on (without squeezing the tabs) until it clicks.   Is this really a question that someone needs to go to the Internet for?  You can't figure it out without the assistance of the World Wide Web?  If you are that much need of the PB, poke a hole in the bottom and shotgun it like a beer.    Here are two more FAQ's:   I noticed that Pepto-Bismol sometimes darkens the tongue/stool. Why does this happen and how long does it last?  The active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol contains bismuth. When a small amount of bismuth combines with trace amounts of sulfur in your saliva and gastrointestinal tract, a black-colored substance (bismuth sulfide) is formed. This discoloration is temporary and harmless. It can last several days after you stop taking Pepto-Bismol. Individual bowel habits, your age (the intestinal tract slows down with age), and the amount of the product taken all help to determine how long Pepto-Bismol is in your system.   and  What do I do if I spill Pepto-Bismol and it leaves a stain? * For carpet stains, please note: If your carpet has a manufacturer's warranty, you need to contact the manufacturer for their stain removal instructions before you attempt to remove the stain. The manufacturer can refuse to honor the warranty if you use something other than what they recommend.  Pepto-Bismol Liquid Staining * If the carpet does not have a stain warranty, proceed with the following recommendations...blah blah blah    First off, why are you inspecting your shit so closely?  Your tongue I can see but the toliet bowl?  Gross.  I also wonder if there was enough questions posed to the company regarding the shit that it had to become one of their FAQ's?!  Secondly, are people really spilling this much PB on their carpets?  Use your fucking head - how would you clean up any other stain, idiot?

       Please welcome a guest author: Alicia   The word for today is Alopecia meaning loss of hair, wool or feathers: baldness.  Please use it in a sentence for today.   Also, I believe that I will soon be suffering from alopecia.  Last night around 8ish I got into my head that I should perm my hair.  Yes I did say perm. I decided to act on it.  I went to Walgreens and got the materials AND DID IT!!!! However, it didn't turn out the way that I was planning it. It is poodle like on the top and wave on the bottom.  Our house smells of perm.  Adam came home last night and woke me up at 3 in the morning to ask me what the smell is.  I had to lie because I was so embarrassed to tell him that I permed my hair. I am really not sure what I am going to do about it!!!!  I really need to stop doing things to my hair (ie cutting it, perming, and dying it).  It seems like I am really cheap because I do it all by myself, but in truth I spend so much money that by the end of the week I have about 3 dollars to my name.  I thought you might enjoy that story of my life.

       Guilty Pleasure   Today on this lazy Saturday - I watched 2 hours of Beverly Hills 90210.  I never really watched this show while it was on primetime but it seems that I missed out on some really great teenage drama.  I think I will start watching it.  I didn't really realize that Luke Perry was so hot on that show.    I love it!

       Newlyweds Premiere   I watched my TiVoed Newlyweds season premiere yesterday and it starts out with the two of them getting in the car and Jessica say, "Aren't you going to open the door for me?" and he tells her that she can open her own door.  She whines and tells him that he used to do it when they were first married and his retort is, "I got laid a lot more when we were first married."    This was hilarious and probably true for most people.

        Stuff    In the most recent Stuff magazine, with Nicole Ritchie on the front, there is a disturbing article about O.J. Simpson. (Editor's note: I think O.J. is as guilty as the day is long - he is too cocky, never humbled by the fact that his children's mother was murdered? Unnatural.)  Anyway, the article that begins on page 92 talks about this straight to DVD,  Punk'd  take off called  Juiced .  It follows generally the same format as  Punk'd .  The article chronicles the shooting of this straight to DVD gem as well as O.J.'s continued erratic behavior.    Towards the end of the article, the author describes the scene,  "We are now in the VIP room of a Las Vegas strip club.  O.J. is very drunk and is telling jokes. "Who was the first Jewish guy to get a Heisman Trophy?" asks O.J., who is sprawled out in a large chair. "Fred Goldman, because he got mine!"   This is so disgusting. Heinous. Does the man not know that he was CONVICTED in civil court?    Good night nurse.

       Movie Etiquette   So tonight we stop by the cheap movies to see Starsky & Hutch which was quite hilarious.  To our right, a hoosier family had brought their infant into the theatre to enjoy a little Ben Stiller.  About halfway into the movie, the baby starts to fuss and the woman I assume to be the mother, ushers them out.    What would possess someone to bring a baby to a movie?  Is this normal practice?  Am I being over sensitive?

Although a moment ago, out of the corner of my eye I saw something on my shoulder - I whipped my head around to see what is was and it was all this hair from my head.  WHAT IS THIS?  Why are globs of hair relocating to my shirt?  Anyway - it scared me.  Unfortunately this may be the days highlight.   The day started off badly when I woke up LATE.  This is because I went to the gym late last night so my body was like oh no - not time to get up.  Damn you Sharper Image Alarm clock!

       Office Etiquette Again   The following are things I have experienced at work that I are experiences that would be better if I had avoided:   Once a coworker pulled up her shirt and scratched her chest while I was having a conversation with her.    People who bring fish to work, tuna included, and heat it in the community microwave.     More as things progress.  This is just a sprinkling of the absurdity.

       Office Music Etiquette   So I am a cube-dweller.  Our office has a room of cubes/student desks-this is where I am located.  There is always a constant silent battle of each person's music.  No one  ever  talks about this annoyance.  Usually this is very annoying but today it was entertaining.  Students A & B had their radio on, as they do most days.  Student C, who by the way is new, says, "Can you turn your radio down, I can't hear mine?"  A silent horror floated over our cubes - the music problem was addressed...out loud...by the new kid!   They turned it down, but then it was awkward.

       When someone gets a beating, you know that somewhere, a Miller Lite is involved   So I didn't get the job I applied for.  This is no good.  So then the first thing out of everyone's mouth, myself included, was, "Well everything happens for a reason."  Taking a step back I wondered why no one says that when good shit happens?  "Oh I won the lottery, everything happens for a reason" is not something you commonly hear.   Rats.

       Sundays   Sundays are bittersweet in that they are the end of the weekend but also a nice end to the hectic week.  Usually on Sunday's we do laundry, homework, maybe cut the grass, and pickup the house.  All this is preparation for an evening of HBO enjoyment.  I like hanging out with B all day, basically doing nothing, save the errant trip to the grocery store or something.    On Sunday nights, I usually find that I can't sleep.  I don't know whether this is in anticipation of the upcoming weeks events or whether I slept too late and I am just not tired yet.  At any rate, come Monday a.m. I am usually wide awake.  This is a strange phenomenon seeing as I am not a morning person and no other day of the week is the recipient of this bright-eyed, bushy tailed feeling.    I may crash by one o'clock today....

       Husbands   So I have some friends who love to hate their husbands.  At any given point, their husband is a total asshole, then they do  one  nice thing and they are the king of the free world.  What is this passive-aggressive behavior?  It's one thing to argue with your spouse but it is entirely another to consistently take a rash of shit from them.  I guess because women love to bitch, this behavior is more prevalent in the female gender?  I think it's not being able to stand up for yourself.

       Going out   So I am tired of going out.  We go out say, every weekend.  It is becoming hella ass boring.  It is expensive and it is becoming more and more common to get THE WORST service after you have spent anywhere in the range of 40-100 bucks.  It's actually funny.  Consider the following example:  We are at Mike & Mins in Soulard.  Months ago, we swore we would never go there to eat after a horrible service related experience at lunch.  True to our word, we hadn't been there in nearly a year.  Until last night.  We were fiending for some of their excellent pretzel sticks, warm with hot cheese dipping sauce.  You really can't find these anywhere else.  Our minds, fuzzy from anticipation of these delectable carbs, we had all but forgotten our resolve made so many months earlier.  Until Waitress #1 came back and said they are out of Kaluhua. (Sidenote: we had been at a bar previous that was out of Bacardi - a mortal sin for a bar in our opinion.)  This is accompanies the fact that W and B could hardly taste the Bacardi in the drinks they had just received - they had to be sent back. (They needed a man's drink - ha.)  We placed our food order, complete with the pretzels, when Waitress #1 comes back, and informs us that they are out of cheese, a crucial part of the pretzel snacks.  She offered us honey mustard and/or marinara. (When did marinara become an acceptable accompaniment to pretzels I wondered?) I chose the honey mustard.  B asked her to melt some cheese into a cup which I thought was hilarious.  In the meantime, I ordered a hurricane.  It took about....25  minutes to get the twelve thousand dollar glass of indigestion with a straw.  It took so long that B had to go up to the bar and pick it up himself.    As soon as he gets back, Waitress #2 brings us a hurricane.  Keep in mind, I already had one.  She was confused.  The tardy hurricane was dismissed and sent packing, back to the bar.    Finally the food comes, and there is no honey mustard because - you guessed it - they were out.  I was like Waitress #1 just offered it when she gave us the bad cheese news and the waitress #2 said, "We are always out of something at this bar."  Oh - that's a great answer #2.  We get COLD marinara and B asks again for someone to melt some cheese into a cup.  Blah blah blah - we get the bill and we are charged for three GD hurricanes.  We are like, yeah take two of these off the bill.  By this point, Waitress #1 has returned and goes off to correct the bill.  She comes back and runs our card to complete the transaction.  Upon reexamination of the bill, B sees that we were charged for 2 hurricanes still.  6 hours and 16 carbon receipts later, finally we are free to go.  This is just one example of why I am sick of going out.  B never did get his cheese melted into a cup.

       Of the sea   So I am flipping through the nine gazillion channels to find nothing on - again when lo and behold, MTV is playing a Newlyweds marathon, all leading to the series premiere next week.  I immediately hit set the social miracle known as TiVo to tape all the remaining shows.  You can't help but want to watch the show.  Jessica Simpson is just lucky that she is beautiful because she is not the sharpest crayon in the box, by far. I read an article this month where she said that she is not really that dumb, she has always played up the role of ditzy blonde because "guys like that type of thing."  Why would a woman, or anyone really, want to assume this role?  Of course she isn't doing too bad as far as life goes now is she?    Also, how are you still a newlywed after three years?  I guess that makes us newlyweds still too.    The show is addicting, like any reality show that has ugly, rich, beautiful or mean people on it.    I love it!

       Can you believe this?     Man's dead body lies undisturbed for two decades in Tokyo apartment  Associated Press 06/10/2004  TOKYO (AP) -- The decomposed body of a man dressed in pajamas was discovered in an abandoned Tokyo apartment building 20 years after he is believed to have died, police said Thursday.  A Tokyo Metropolitan Police official said construction workers were preparing to tear down the building earlier this month when they found the man's skeletal remains laying face-up on a mattress on the tatami reed mat floor of a second-floor room.  The morning edition of a newspaper dated Feb. 20, 1984 was on a table nearby and a calendar, opened to the same month, hung on the wall, said the official, who refused to be identified.  The official would not say how the man died. Newspaper reports quoted police as saying that there were no signs of struggle, which led investigators to believe he died of an illness.  The man, identified only as former worker of the company that built the apartments, was in his mid-50s when he divorced his wife, left home and moved into the building in the early 1980s, the official said.  Police believe the man had been unable to repay bank loans and had stopped showing up for work, according to the newspaper reports.  But nobody noticed his death because the real estate agency managing the property went out of business after the building was completed in 1973 without ever having found renters, he said. The building had been unoccupied since it was completed.  The man's remains have been returned to his ex-wife, the official said.

       Sopranos Season Finale   I forgot to blog about the Sopranos season finale!  I thought is was good although it seems to have received mixed reviews.  After s very sluggish season, the final 2 episodes were very good.     Breakfast   This morning B got up and made me a breakfast of french toast.  It was very sweet.

       J Lo   As one coworker so eloquently put it: She leaves me speechless.  What is the deal with J Lo and the marriages?  It pretty damn funny.  I would love to know the details of her marriages/divorces/bennifers/annulments/engagements.  Or do we already all know it?  Isn't it a lot of paperwork?   I would have stuck with P Diddy since he has the most money and the biggest entourage.  Mo money mo problems I guess.  Que sera sera.  One great pig.  The D the I the D the D the Y.

       The weekend    Harry Potter  The third installment of Harry Potter was great.  If you had not read the book, I think there were probably a few loopholes but overall it was very entertaining.  We will probably see it again before it leaves the theatres.   Taste of Clayton  The weather couldn't have been better for TOC this year but the ticket prices went up .25, making each ticket $1.25 - which is pretty ridiculous.  I think we dropped a hundred bucks on tastes of food.  (Also J. Bucks martinis - damn you!)  As I have said, this is the only time one can get the cheese bread from the Bread Co. so it's worth every ticket it costs!  (Read: $85)  The weekend went to damn fast.  I don't like it!

       Toliet Humor   I was barely sitting down when I heard a voice from the other  stall saying:  "Hi, how are you?"   I'm not the type to start a conversation in the men's restroom  but I don't know what got into me, so I answered, somewhat embarrassed, "Doin' just fine!"   And the other guy says: "So what are you up to?"   What kind of question is that?  At that point, I'm thinking this  is too bizarre so I say: "Uhhh, I'm like you, just traveling!"   At this point I am just trying to get out as fast as I can when I  hear another question. "Can I come over?"   Ok, this question is just too weird for me but I figured I could  just be polite and end the conversation.  I tell him, "No........I'm a little busy right now!!!"   Then I hear the guy say nervously...   "Listen, I'll have to call you back.  There's an idiot in the other  stall who keeps answering all my questions

       From the urlLink  RFT  today   As for Harry himself (Daniel Radcliffe), let's just say it's a shame that Star Wars Episode III has wrapped principal photography, because Hayden Christensen could learn a lot from young Radcliffe's portrayal of adolescent angst meeting magical fury. Unfortunately, perennial rival Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) gets short shrift this time, losing all his menace and becoming, to put it bluntly, a whiny little bitch.  That is hilarious.

       The Internet   If you work in an office environment, how can you NOT understand how the Internet works?  How can you be confused by Mapquest?    I once witnessed a phone call to a company that employed a popup banner stating, "You have won a cruise!  Click here to claim your free cruise...blah blah blah!"  This person called and said, "Yes I am calling about the cruise I won, how do I get it?"  As I walked by I saw that coworker was refering to the popup on her screen.  Exhibit A urlLink    HA&nbsp; urlLink      Equally funny is when people blame the Internet for things like  1) Their bad ass kids. 2) World Terror. 3) Their laziness. 4) World Destruction.  Also when they say that the Internet is a phase, like it is always on the verge of flickering out like a gaslight.  I love it!

       This was ganked from  urlLink Pup's  blog     &nbsp;   This is interesting - just another point of view:     Things you have to believe to be a Republican today: &nbsp;    Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton. &nbsp;   Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion. &nbsp;   Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is Communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony. &nbsp;   The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq. &nbsp;   A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation. &nbsp;   The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay. &nbsp;   If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex. &nbsp;   A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then demand their cooperation and money. &nbsp; Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy.   Providing health care to all Americans is socialism. &nbsp;   HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart. &nbsp;   Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools. &nbsp;   A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense. &nbsp;   A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy. &nbsp;   Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet. &nbsp;   The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's driving record is none of our business. &nbsp;   Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery. &nbsp;   You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt. &nbsp;   What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.

       WTF   This is really a funny ass section of an&nbsp;article on MSN.&nbsp; I wondered if it was real news.&nbsp; I have italicized/colored the lines I find especially funny.    Saddam writes poetry, gardens in prison   Newspaper: Former Iraqi leader appears 'dejected' The Associated Press Updated: 12:04 p.m.&nbsp;ET July&nbsp;26, 2004  LONDON - Saddam Hussein appears depressed and demoralized in solitary confinement,   spending his time writing poetry, tending a garden and reading the Quran  , according to a report published Monday in The Guardian newspaper. advertisement  urlLink  One of   Saddam’s poems is about George Bush  , though the report did not specify whether that referred to President Bush or his father, Saddam’s foe in the 1991 Gulf War. The newspaper quoted Bakhtiar Amin, the human rights minister in the new Iraqi government, who said he had visited Saddam’s cell on Saturday. Amin said he did not speak to the former Iraqi leader.  Bakhtiar said Saddam appeared “in good health and being kept in good conditions,” but he “appeared demoralized and dejected,” The Guardian reported. Saddam’s air-conditioned cell in a U.S. military prison is 10 feet wide and 13 feet long, Amin said. Saddam is not allowed to mix with other prisoners.    Saddam likes American muffins, cookies.   Amin had little to report on Saddam’s poetry. “One of the poems is about George Bush, but I had no time to read it,” Amin said.  He reported that Saddam was being treated for high blood pressure and a chronic prostate infection, and was gaining weight after losing 11 pounds during a time when he resisted all fatty foods.  Saddam and other detainees get an MRE (meal ready to eat) breakfast, and hot food twice a day, Amin said. Dessert might include oranges, apples, pears or plums, but   Saddam also likes American muffins and cookies  , The Guardian quoted Amin as saying. Saddam is not allowed newspapers, TV or radio, but has access to 145 books — mostly travel books and novels — donated by the Red Cross. Amin said   Saddam tends a garden   during his daily three-hour exercise period.   “He is looking after a few bushes and shrubs and has even placed a circle of white stones around a small palm tree,  ” said Amin. “His apparent care for his surroundings is ironic when you think he was responsible for one of the biggest ecocides when he drained the southern marshes.”

       Lunchcapades    So we go out to lunch at work today. We are all in the car on the way back to the office, rolling 3 deep in the backseat.&nbsp; It's me, my boss and coworker.&nbsp; My boss is in the middle and she busts out some dental floss and precedes to FLOSS HER TEETH in the car.&nbsp; Please remember that:    We are in someone else's car.  We had JUST finished eating so you know there was still some big foodage in there.  The boss is closely flanked by me and my coworker.  It's 900 degrees with the heat index.   I am not sure how #4 applied but it needed to be noted.&nbsp; Flossing in public with a monstrous heat index seems more inappropriate than if it was say, a crisp fall afternoon.

       From Reuters today  &nbsp; LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Pop star Michael Jackson, facing a trial on child molestation charges, is about to become a father to four more children -- quadruplets -- by way of a surrogate mother, Us Weekly magazine reported on Tuesday.  Citing unnamed sources close to the self-proclaimed "King of Pop," the magazine said Jackson recently spent time with the pregnant mother-to-be in Florida, where he stayed in a $4,000-a-night luxury hotel suite in Miami Beach.  The magazine said Jackson's spokeswoman Raymone Bain declined to confirm or deny the story, saying, "We do not respond to these kinds of stories."  Bain could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters.   Jackson, 45, already has three children -- Prince Michael I and daughter Paris Michael by his former wife, Debbie Rowe, and Prince Michael II, the child he notoriously dangled from the balcony of a Berlin hotel in November 2002.   Jackson later revealed in a television documentary that Prince Michael II had been born to a woman who was essentially a stranger to him. "I used a surrogate mother and my own sperm cells," he told British interviewer Martin Bashir. "She doesn't know me."

       Ok this is great - taken from The Sun   &nbsp;  By LUCY HAGAN   TROUBLED Britney Spears sinks to a new low — swigging whisky and Red Bull and scoffing junk food in the street with her love-rat fiancé.  The once-glamorous pop princess, 22, looked a slob as she drifted from one low-budget store to another for lunch with jobless dancer Kevin Federline.  First the pair — who have just flown home from a beach holiday in Hawaii — picked up French fries at Neptune’s Net on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu.   Hic me baby ... Britney emerges from liquor store with whisky miniature and Red Bull  Then 15 minutes later, they stopped at sandwich shop Subway for filled rolls and fizzy orange. They left munching bags of cheese and onion Wheatos crisps and salt and vinegar Lays.  Finally, came their third stop in 30 minutes — at a liquor store to buy Britney a miniature of Glenlivet whisky. She gulped it down in one, followed by a chaser of caffeine drink Red Bull.  Kevin, 26 — who has dumped his seven-months pregnant lover to woo Britney — clutched a bottle of cola and a stuffed grocery bag with a packet of cigs balancing on the top.  An onlooker said: “I had to look twice — it didn’t even look like Britney. Her hair was a mess and she looked like she was wearing his jeans, they were so long.   Oops I did it again ... singer gorgingon bags of crisps with fiance Kevin  “The only giveaway was her bling-bling engagement ring.”  Britney — who six months ago wed pal Jason Alexander for 55 hours — has known Kev three months. She proposed to him with a £25,000 ring.   The singer has been riding high at No1 with Everytime but has cancelled a world tour because of a knee injury. She was recently pictured looking bloated, spotty and puffing a ciggy.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Britney's Malibu diet:   Starter:  Portion of French fries  Main course:  A Subway roll, packets of cheese and onion Wheatos and salt and vinegar Lays crisps with a bottle of orangeade  Dessert:  Miniature bottle of Glenlivet whisky with a Red Bull energy drink chaser

       Long Distance .  So this woman calls today at work and then after she gets pissy about being on hold she informs me that, "she is calling long distance."  She mentions this several more times in a 3-second time period so I put her on hold again.  This incident posed the question: who the hell still pays for long distance?  I have not heard anyone state that "they are calling long distance" in I don't know how long.    In summation: stop paying for long distance and get a cell phone.

This is taken from an article on MSN today about the Bush twins:  Public debut The 22-year-old twins look like debutantes, minor royals, or that particular New York species of well-groomed, pedigreed and socially connected woman known as the "Bright Young Thing." For much of the time their father has been in the White House, they were kept under wraps. Occasionally they emerged from their protected world to be snapped attending a fashion show or traveling with their mother.   I want to be part of the "Bright Young Thing" group.  But then I need a bigger clothing allowance.

       Depression & Stank   So I go to the gym, MUCH more often than I used to and I am still being told by the scale and the  Glamour  mag BMI calculator that I am still a lard ass.  This makes me depressed.    At the gym, I was on the elliptical machine next to a man that was sweating everywhere, which is naturally to be expected but he really smelled like ass.  I was like damn dude, if you are going to go to the gym for a hard workout - double up on the deodorant.  A little courtesy here.  I think I mentioned this in another blog but I feel that I must make a PSA out of it.    I like this  urlLink site  that I read about in the new  Glamour  I got today.

       The Hamptons   This is taken from an article about adding value to your home:  Berges's book is geared toward middle-class homeowners. On the upper end, buyers expect well-kept yards and painted walls, of course, but they often yearn for amenities that middle-class people might not expect. For example, one of the hot trends in the Hamptons on Long Island, says architect Marcia Previti of Gillis Previti Architects, is for two dishwashers in the kitchen. "You might reserve one for glassware and one for pots and big dishes," she says.  Ok - in the Hampton's they need TWO dishwashers????  This is royal.    I wish I was British with a house in the Hamptons.

       My Girl Fridays   Another My Girl Friday success!  I got home, (skipped the gym) and headed to Blockbuster.  Since I had already watched  The Good Girl , I didn't have much left TiVo'ed.  I rented  Girl with a Pearl Earring , which was a great book by Tracy Chevalier, and  Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves .  Yes, I know it's an oldie but I had never seen it.     Girl with a Pearl Earring  was good, mostly because Colin Firth was in it, but there wasn't a lot of dialogue and like always, is missing a lot that was in the book.  I think that unless you 1. read the book or 2. love fictional stories about Vermeer paintings, you won't get a whole hell of a lot out of it.  As for  Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves , I always liked in the Disney version. Although I noted that in the Disney version, Friar Tuck was not a drunk like in the Kevin Costner one.    Now I know that my friend Asian Werewolf is not a Kevin Costner fan but I like him.  I do have to admit that this movie was a little overacted but I love the love story and that Bryan Adams song that we all considered to be a song of our lives in late middle school.    Also I think I have seen 25 movies this past month all with Alan Rickman in them!  Funny since I didn't know who he was until his role as Snape in HP 1-3.  Also great about that movie was how Sean Connery popped in at the end.  Oh King Richard!

       Market value    From MSN Careers  And the next question is, since it's so important, how do you determine your market value?  You start with your compensation and try to ascertain what it should be, the career expert says.  "Research comparable salaries and find out what the market pays for someone with your skills and background," said Lee, whose Web site includes that information. "Next, determine what your contribution will be or what it is to the company's bottom line--especially anything you have done or can do to generate revenue and cut costs. And finally, show what you bring to the party, your new ideas, how you've figured out a way to work more efficiently and to work harder, and how you are a team player.  "When you do that, you know your worth to yourself and to the company. You know your market value."  Lee adds that knowing your market value gives you the confidence to ace a job interview and to get the promotion you want. I asked him if he ever uses "market value" himself. "All the time," the executive responded. "Every day. I'm happy and challenged."  If you want to be happy like Lee in this tight and competitive labor market, it's very important to ascertain and list all your attributes. Here are some you might have forgotten that really can make a difference in whether or not you get the job or the promotion. So don't forget to state:  - I pay for and bring a box of delicious doughnuts for the entire staff at least once a week.  - I know all the best restaurants within a six-block area.  - I always hang my coat or jacket in the closet instead of draping it over my chair or desk.  - I am the world's best employee.  - I never brag.

      People who beg their hairdressers for an appointment.  This is something that I witnessed this morning.  A person I know that  ALWAYS  acquiesces to people tried to make an appointment to get a haircut, then pathetically begged the hairdresser to give her an appointment, even though it sounded like she had plenty.  I have never met someone who lets so many people use her like a doormat.  You are paying them, not them paying you.  Wow.

       Oh Independence Day!   So this weekend was super fun.  We spent Saturday at my parent's house with the whole fam.  There was lots of babies around which was fun.  There was also lots of sarcasm - I don't think I have laughed that hard in a long long time.  Tears were streaming down my face.    On the 4th - people did crazy huge displays of fireworks all around our neighborhood so we didn't have to go anywhere!    Monday we tried to go see Dodgeball but the lines for even getting in the building were insane.  I didn't know this was a big movie day.  We ended up renting Cold Mountain & Mystic River both which I very much enjoyed.    On a related note, I used to dislike Sean Penn.  Now I think he is a little bit hot.  Maybe not hot like George Clooney but sexy I guess.  The last two movies I have seen him in have moved him up a notch for me.

       How about this??      Prisoner glues himself to girlfriend   MADRID, Spain (Reuters) -- A German prisoner in Madrid and his girlfriend glued their hands together during a jail visit in an attempt to fight the man's possible extradition to Germany, judicial sources said on Thursday. The pair were taken to hospital, where doctors were considering whether to operate or use a powerful solvent to separate the man's left hand from the woman's right.  The glue is a type normally used in car repairs.  Spanish police arrested the 39-year-old man in the southern city of Cadiz in April on request from Germany, where he faces accusations of smuggling women from Eastern Europe to force them into prostitution, the judicial sources said.  The Madrid court studying the extradition request will not make a decision for several months, they added. The man has a separate judicial case pending in Spain and authorities want it resolved before any handover to Germany.

       Three More Years of Oprah    What would we ever do without Oprah in the afternoon? We’ll probably never have to find out. The talk show maven signed with King World Productions to keep the gravy train going through the 2010-11 season, which will be its 25th year in syndication.  The new contract between King World and Winfrey’s Harpo Productions calls for a boost in the number of shows each season. Beginning with the 2004-05 season, the number of new episodes will increase from 130 to 140, however, the load drops back to 130 episodes for the last year of the contract in 2011.  The Chicago-based program continues to dominate in the ratings, and has ranked first among talk shows for 71 consecutive "sweeps" periods. The program airs on more than 200 U.S. stations and is distributed to more than 100 other countries.   Photo Copyright Getty Images       Thank God!  I desperately wanted to go to Oprah when I was in Chicago last weekend but it seems that you have to get tickets 100 years in advance!  Hopefully I can make it there by 2011!

       THE VOTE   So Missourian's primaries were this week and I have to say I am a little disgruntled., but I guess not surprised, with the results. I wonder if the Midwest will ever change how it looks at things. I think the mentality is kin to that of the 1950's.  Naturally I read in the NY Times that Missouri's proposed amendment regarding their pinheaded non-acceptance of gay marriage will set the precedent for other states' primaries. That is something to be proud of now, isn't it?  The main argument I hear against this is that it destroys the institution of marriage. Well I didn't know it was so sacred. Divorce rates are hilariously high. Especially today - don't you think it's healthier to be with the person you love than stuck in a situation that makes you miserable? I think that is a weak position to take on it. I would like to examine the marriages of those who argue this platform. I am sure that we will find that everything is peaches and cream. Oh wait, probably not, assholes.  I just can't see why it matters? Is it better to make people unhappy just so you can hide behind your Bible and feel better about your hypocritical ass? Does this make you a better person?

       What I have viewed in the last 3 days:   Bourne Identity   A   - We were very late in watching this, and when we went to rent it every weekend - the bitch was all rented out! Amish in the City     B  -  I know but it's fun. Did you know the Amish only go to school until 8th grade? Nip/Tuck   A   - Can this show pack anymore drama into 1 hour? Good Lord! I love it! Six Feet Under   A   - Holy Shit. The baby, the mama, the drama. Yeah...I know...again. Bourne Supremacy   A   - I thought the car chase was longer than the Matrix 2 car chase. Is that possible?  We also viewed several other tv shows, all to receive honorable mention. Hey - they  did  make the TiVo cut but then again, TiVo/me is not very discriminatory.

       SWEET CHOCOLATE CHRIST!   I have been in blog withdrawls! This will probably continue until at least Wednesday! We went to Chicago for about 4 days and now I have a ridiculous amount of work to catch up on this week!  All work and no blogging makes a sad Princess of Power.  Hang in there with me - I am also behind on reading my faves! I have some great stories from Chicago!  Could I use more exclamation points?
