      Hey Kids! I could totally keep rambling about the summer, but I've realized that It's not really pertinant. (Did I spell that right?) Oh well. First musical rehearsal tonite and I can already tell it's gonna be great. I get to be a whore AND insane. SWEET! How does it get better than that? Honestly. I love this driving thing! It rocks! For those of you who don't know, or who I lied to for a while (can you blame me?) I just got my license Friday. Ok, if I lied to you about that at any point, I'm REALLY sorry, but can you really blame me? I mean, I'm 17, I shoulda had it last year when Ben got his. But it's all good, cuz I've got it now. Which means, yes, I AM going to get piercings and tattooes and randomly go out with people. If anybody has Psychology with Mr. Owens, that class ROCKS! Larissa, you're right, Mrs. Koerten DOES act like a kindergarten teacher. And I would come to school stoned during her class if I did that, but I don't. I do lots of stuff, but not that. Wow, I wish I had more to ramble on. I don't really so I'm going to make stuff up. Saturday nite I went out with a friend of mine to get his tattoo worked on. It's fun. And the dude at the tattoo parlor was like, Hey baby, you look like you need something on your body. So we went over to his desk to look at the pictures and stuff, even tho the whole time I'm like, yeah, I'm not getting a tattoo, not yet anyways. And he's just like, yea, that's alright sweetheart. And the next thing I know his hand it creeping up the back of shirt! I'm like, EWW! Ok, this guy is like 45 and he's greasy and gross and he's like as much body hair as he has tattooes and his beer belly's hanging out and EWW!!! So, I bitch slapped him and then I kneed him right in the balls, it was fabulous! I grabbed my friend and we were outta there faster than you've EVER seen anyone run. It's like those Olympic commercials where the person like running and all of a sudden he turns into this Olympic runner and then right back to himself. Yea, it was like that, only way creepier and way cooler at the same time. Haha, ok so I hope ya'll could tell that that story was made up, but if you couldn't tell that's WAY sweet! You need to be my friend. Well, that's all for now! Luv Ya'll!

      So, I'm not terribly sure how this is all gonne work, but after the summer I had and the first week of school, I figured hell, if I can just ramble and no one HAS to listen, this is defintely a good thing! So let's start with the beginning of the summer. I went to England. Now, ya'll are gonna think, hey, what's so bad about that? And it's not bad, not on the surface anyways, but ya'll weren't there. Ya'll didn't have to watch someone you liked flirt with half of the girls, except you of course. Sorry if you're reading this Matt, but it is how I felt, at the time anyways. But no worries kids, the two of us, we're all good now.  Oh, I should go back to May however. Just because I'm a spastic conversationalist and I just thought of this just now. Prom, holy hell! Now, some of ya'll know this story, so you can skip this if you want, but I'm telling it anyways. So, I really like Sean Meister and I asked him to prom. And he nonchalantly says "yea, sure, if I don't have a bowling tournament". Now, I apparently don't know what bowling means to this kid. Or rather I didn't know. Cuz I thought, yea sure, miss prom for a bowling tournament...... I figured I was set, I'd have this great dress, Mattie would do my hair and makeup, I'm going with this kid I really like, it'll be great. I was seriously floating for like, I dunno how long. Then, we're talking on AIM one nite and he says, I gotta ask you a question. Sure, whatever, people ask questions all the time. And Sean tells me that he got qualified for this huge tournament and he doesn't know what to do. Now, I can't tell him to go bowling, cuz I want him to come to prom with me. And I can't tell him to come to prom with me, cuz bowling is like his life. So I told him that I really wanted him to come, but I would TOTALLY understand if he went bowling. And so he works on the idea for a while and says that he'll tell me soon cuz he doesn't wanna be the jerk that says the nite before prom, "oh I can't go with you". Ok, good deal. Well, he hasn't said anything for a week or so, I'm not really sure and this girl Lindsey in our gym class says that she heard that Sean isn't going to prom, that he's going to the tournament. Of course, I don't wanna believe her, so I go straight to Sean and ask him. Anyone in Swing Choir or just Fine Arts will know that this day, the Swing Choirs were leaving for Chicago. I booked it down to the band room where the buses were parked outside and called him out of the bus to ask him. Lindsey was right, (I hate it when that happens). He was gonna go to the tournament. I said, yea, cool. Gave him a hug and went back inside for band class. Two lucky things happened for me that day. One, we had a sub and just watched a movie in band, and two, I was getting outta class early that day.  So, when I go home tho, and Sean, if you're reading this, PLEASE don't feel bad! But when I got home, I seriously cried most of the nite. Ok, ya'll are saying why did you cry over a prom date, it's not like he left you the nite of prom? You're also saying, how can you tell Sean not to feel bad?! Well, the thing is that two days before prom, I still didn't have a date and was talking to Sean and found out that he wasn't going to the tournament, but didn't want to tell me because he didn't want me to feel bad. That's SUPER sweet by the way. Well, I ended up *going* with Drew Christianson, except I rode there and back with Ben Samson and Amelia O'Donnell. Thanks SO much for lettin gme tag alongs you two! Oh, and I didn't see Drew almost the entire nite except a little at After Prom when he stuck fake money in my pants. Larissa, you know what I'm talking about. So, that's my exciting prom fiasco and lemme give ya'll some advice although I'm sure you're smart enough not to do this, but NEVER go to prom without a date, ok?!  So, let's move past England and Prom on to Camp. What an experience! It was awesome! So much fun I can't even describe it. It was 5 days of laughing and crying and flirting and holding hands and arms and laying across three of my friends and being cuddle buddies with a guy I like(d). (Not sure if I still do) It was just go go go and fun fun fun and I didn't cry Chris! You said I would cry and I didn't! You said I would cry if you told me that you love me, but you didn't tell me and I didn't cry, so there! :-P Hehe, I love you! And now school as started. I realize that I still like Sean. I made the musical, so I really am a whore now. And I LOVE Mr. Owens's Psychology class!  So, who thinks I should get my tongue pierced?
