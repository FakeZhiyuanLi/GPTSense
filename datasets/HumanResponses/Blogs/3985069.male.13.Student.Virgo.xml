       It is  sooooooooooooo  hard.&nbsp; Tomorrow I have to go again and then I have to go away for a week and do it even more.&nbsp; It is pretty fun but it is really hard work!&nbsp; I got called out of the crowd today and the instructor told me to walk in front of the crowd because they said that I have a very good roll walk(a type of walk in marching)!&nbsp; Well its my sister's birthday tomorrow and we are celebrating it today so I gotta go.

      I way about 135 and I am trying to lose fat and gain muscle at the moment. My parents divorced about 2and a half years ago and my mom has re-married! I love my family alot and I hang out with them all the time! I absoluteley love computer games and ALL video games though I am trying to get off of them and go out side more often. I have about five people who like me and I do not like anyone right now. So I guess you could say that I have a good personality and all that stuff. I am doing ok in school and going into the 9th grade. I have three sisters and one brother! I know its a ton!!!! I just moved into a new house about a month ago and it is HUGE compared to the tiny trailer we used to live in. Stuffing 7 people into a trailer isn't too fun! I used to play all sports except foot ball and tennis. (all those other wierd sports too) I am looking forward to the new school year so that I can hang out with friends again and maybe play some more sports! I am in choir and band (hopefully quitting band soon!) and in most of the school plays. I was the main part (Jesus) in Godspell last year and hoping to be a main part in one of the plays in high school.

       Well I'm back from band camp and it was so hard!  I am glad to be back and be able to sleep in my bed that isn't all flat like the ones at band camp.  I have gotten a very dark tan and I (unfortunatly) haven't lost any weight.  I just wanted to say that when I say band is hard you do not want to underestimate the hardness that band is. A ton of people underestimate marching band and it a lot harder than people think it is.  you have to march around just as much as you have to run around in foot ball and marching is harder than walking.  And you have to play music while you march around witch deprives you from enough oxygen and makes you lose your breath.  So whoever said that football was harder was absolutely wrong.  I wanna see you try memorize music and then play it while you are marching.  And also just to tell you guys that if you read this and put a comment on it then please sign your name at the end so that I can know whoever commented on it.  Thanks!                                                                                                   I'll write later,                                                                                                                       Mathew Thompson
