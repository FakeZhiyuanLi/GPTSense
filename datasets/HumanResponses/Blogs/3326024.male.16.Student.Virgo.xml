      In a unknown state for the past 48 hours, here I sit. It is sunday afternoon, and I am not really sure what happened has happened to the time. Being gone for the past two days doing things with people I know, yet it feels like I did nothing at all. Well anyways, I am sitting here listening to some Jefferson Airplane with a bad headcold, trying to enjoy my last day of freedom before school begins again tomorrow. My teeth feel really weird too, but that may be from a mixture of smoking and alcohol but who knows. I am slowly coming to the realization that I am jerk, but only when I am with people I know. In my opinion this is because I am not afraid to tell them my thoughts about them, which may come off as me being mean to them. The truth hurts I guess. Well maybe I am not a jerk, I just tell it how it is, which makes it seem that way. For now I will leave you with my most eventfull happening this weekend, set on a friday afternoon...  School was boring and pointless. I really should have either stayed home or just skipped my classes and gone to other teachers classes. The latter probably would have been the best, more fun I presume. But I just went to my classes, and of course did nothing. The weekend finally arrived and I met up with friends after school. We do this every friday, nothing ever changes, I am going to start doing more, going places and seeing things. But anyways we made a call, and got a connection to Mr. Green. After a good session, we traveled to Tanasbourne to look at things. That is as far as I can get my friends to go, they would rather just lay around a house all day and do nothing, get fat, whatever, as long as I'm there we are gonna be doing something. The border I get the more truth I speak to them which they prefer not to hear. Well anyways, after that we got together with a friend of ours, Ben, and traveled to his house. In a strange encounter, we met his parents. One of which is a German import on a work visa, who took the liberty to offer us his finest German beer. I must say that it was quite good. My friends aren't much of beer drinkers though, except for Ben. Decent conversation continued, nothing spectacular or worth mentioning. After that I presented a joint to my partners, in which they could not refuse, so we formed a circle and quickly the crayon sized J was nothing but a little roach. I then took the short ride home from my frined Tom, the whole way afraid of certain disaster, a possible wreck or pig encounter, but we made our way back home safely. Marching straight to room, I told my mother good night, and found sleep almost before I hit the comfort of my bed.

      Well now every Thursday feels like it should be Friday to me. The week goes by pretty fast, but then Thursday hits and I enter shut down mode. But tomorrow I have late arrival, so it shouldn't be too bad, and I'm getting an award of somesort for my achievement in scholastic excellence.  Today didn't go too well. I woke up late and had to rush to strength training, working out sucks when you are really tired. The rest of school was pointless, didn't accomplish anything because I had nothing to do. After school I was planning on going to a friends lacrosse game, but unfortunately that didn't work out, so here I sit.  Have you ever had a dream where do you aren't really sure whether its real or not? I had one of those this morning. Saved by the Bell is on at 7 every morning, so I always try to wake up and watch it. I remember waking up but the rest is pretty sketchy. The episode was really weird, and then I woke up again like 15 minutes after the episode. I don't really know if I was asleep the whole time and dreamt the whole episode, or if I actually watched it and just fell asleep at the end. This is the second time that it has happened so I though that it was pretty strange. But yeah, I have a lot of crazy dreams that don't make too much sense, I'll post one the next time I have a real vivd one.

      In this world, where do you stand?  No matter what anyone says, everyone fits in within a certain group. No one is completely alone. Some are more extrovert, others more introvert, but no matter, you can at least find one other person to relate to. And within these groups there are certain orders within them. Every group needs at least one leader, not everyone can be a leader. For a group to exist there needs to be a distinction between leaders and followers. Now back to the question, in this world, where do you stand?  For me, it differs. I have a two different groups of friends. First off is the group in which I am with a majority of the time. This is group of people that are my age, and I consider to be a leader in this group. I administer choices and make sure that the final decision appeals to everyone. But with my other group, which consists mainly of aquintances, I take a backseat and am more of a follower. I believe that this is because I am the youngest one when with them and am a little intimidated. I consider to myself to have an introvert personality, which the second group mainly shows.   But yeah, where do you stand? Do you like where you are? Are you a leader or a follower? Would you rather be the one you are not? What are you gonna do to change that?
