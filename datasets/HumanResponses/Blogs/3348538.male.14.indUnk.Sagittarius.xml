      after an exciting 36 hours awake with jim and ian, i went to sleep yestarday at 5.  i woke up, looked at the clock and it said 4:11.  i'm thinkin "how can it be 4? i fell asleep at 5...holy shit i slept alot.  and i was ready to get up after that, but i figured that would fuk up my sleep schedule even more, so i went to sleep and awoke at 8.  its about 11, band practice at noon.  im listening to planet smashers while eating sunflower seeds.    there's pee in the elavator dont smell to good pee in the elavator dont smell like it should

      ive been awake for 28 hours strait.  we rule.  it seems like today is the longest day ever.  at 5 we randomly got up and hit dunkin donuts.  jim, within 6 seconds of getting his ice coffee, spilled it everywhere.  then we got back and watched lewis black, which rules.  and we played hi lo jak for a while.  then we played vollyball.  then, we went to the beach.  then we washed some cars and played with water and stuff.  then we randomly walked around. and its only fuking noon now. sweet

      well, me and jim just play 3 hours of uno, 2 hours of beavis and butt head and about 2 hours of family guy.  Its almost 4am, and jim just decided he wants to beat final fantasy x2.  I am the champion of champions.  even tho he won about 35 out of 40 games. hehehe  oh yeah the dance was tonite.  it was okayish.  well, i got about 4 hours till the sun comes up, so i leave you with words of genius.   -I believe people with a skin color other then white can govern their own countries- George Dubya

      i had a taco today. but not an ordinary taco, a grande soft taco.  it was huge. why? why was it so big? i was happy of course. a huge taco. what could go wrong? well, by some stroke of stupidity, they decided to drench the outside of the taco with cheese sauce. and it was ridiculoiusly sloppy. are you dumasses really reading about a taco ate today? losers.  also, i have come to realize i suck at visual arts.  you know, the kind of art you can look at. i am a musician.   i love aqua teen hunger force.  surfin early thursday and friday. cant wait.   another point of interest, i have become sick of ska. and the trumpet.  gotta have hendrix, led zep, stevie ray vaughn, the good shit.  out    lord let the sun beat down upon my face

      tonite is a nite of badness. there is no aqua teen hunger force on tonite. it makes me unhappy. however, it will be on tomorrow nite, and the following five nites. for those pour souls who do not watch aqua teen hunger force, it is on cartoon network at midnite, weekdays. watch it. you wont regret it.   now don quioxte de la mancha will bring thee greater glory yet

       yestarday i watched the last samuari, and point break. both were fuckin awesome. today i watched slc punk and head of state. slc punk was ok and had a great ending, head of state was a little bit predictible, and boring at times, but good. i really wanna watch more movies. they are really good except when they suck.
