      Well, I've been thinking about doing this for a while, but couldn't figure out where or how to get one started. Being the person that I am and the things I've experienced there are times when I feel like I don't have anyplace to dump my thoughts. I do need to clean my head out occasionally or I feel like I'll explode.  Its raining here in Eastern Ohio and its humid,,,it sucks, I hate this weather. We're going to a Hawaiian Luau this evening but I think that it's going to be inside. Hopefully its going to be a fun time. The guy that is having it likes to talk about having an interesting party(meaning possibly sex). There's one guy there that we met before who is very cute. He has expressed interest in my partner before so I'm hoping that tonight may be interesting. I'm always up for some fun and my partner doesn't care. Thank God sex is not an issue in our relationship.  I wouldn't say that we have anything close to an open relationship but we both like going to the bath houses, and playing when we go out is usually possible. We've been together for 41/2 years and have a great relationship, and I'm sure that there are people that think if you aren't sexually monogamous that you can't love each but DAMMIT, being in a relationship isn't about sex,,,its about love and respect.  ok, I'm gonna get off my soap box now.

      Well we had a good time, no sex, but my boyfriend got lots of attention from this cute blonde guy.  It's good for his ego.  We didn't get home till like 2am.  It was fun but I'm just getting way toooooooo old for this stuff.  It's supposed to be super hot heer today, like 84 and way tooo humid for my taste.  I want to run today, but I'm not running is this heat.   Hopefully it will cool down this evening and we can run this evening.
