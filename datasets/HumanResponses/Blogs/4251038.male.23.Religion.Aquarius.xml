      Because for the most part I have not had to do it for a year (and for the smart aliec literalist out there I mean write papers not the actual act of writing).  It is important for me to do so because I am like 1 week or less from starting taking classes again.   I am fairly confident that I want to be involved with youth ministry for as long as I am able (which, assuming I am alive or the second coming doesn't happen, would be a good 30+ years).  So in order to better prepare myself I am going to complete course work for a Masters in Biblical Studies.  I am doing it via corespondance from a place called Trinity Theological Seminary.  I have researched the place a fair ammount and they seem very legit.  I got information about my first class, and I have a lot of work to do!  The way it is set up is I only do one class at a time and when I successfully complete all of the requirements, I move on to the next class.  I am really excited about this, and I really looking forward to learning alot.  As much as I dislike substitute teaching, it will acutally be really good for this because I will have a guranteed hour (prep period) every day to work on the school stuff.  So that is really cool.

      It has been a while since I have updated what I am currently playing (since I know everyone cares so much).  I am getting my old school vibe on with Serious Sam:  The Next Encounter.  For those unfamilar with Sam, it is a throwback to the origns of FPS games.  Enemies come in droves but when I have a mini gun it is all good.  I am currently on the last level and it is really hard.  I am also playing Parasite Eve.  This is an RPG for the original Playstation and I really like it.  The battle system is a mix between real time and turn bases that is really cool.  I am close to beating it, but I am currently stuck and I fear that I might be painted into an unbeatable corner due to the fact that I am almost out of bullets (and there are none left in the game for me to get).  I also started playing Devil May Cry again.  This is a game Abigail got me over a year ago, and I started playing it just to get stuck on the first boss and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't do it.  So i started over and this time got by the stupid spider on my first try, and I have advanced rather far in the game.   Speaking of video games, I need to learn how to write a fundraiser letter because in Novemeber the Youth Group is going to do a video game tournament to raise money for Voice of the Matyrs.  It should be cool, but I have to get prizes donated first. . .

      So school as officially started, and I am still without a teaching job.  I had four interviews this summer, and I have thus far recieved three rejection letters.  The fourth school started today, so I am guessing they are just late in sending their letter.  This means that unless something miraculous happens I am destined to another ten months, of substitute teaching.  I really hate substiuting, it sucks.  I hate the way that all teachers assume I am incompetent and do not know the first thing about teaching, I hate that I really have no real power or control over the students and that is accompined by a feeling complete helplessness, and I hate a temporary and meaningless it feels.  I guess the bright spot is I am still doing the youth ministry thing and that is going great, and I love it.  I just desperatly wished they paid me more so I could be fully devoted to that.  This is further complicated by the fact that I know there is a very high chance that another local church is going to be having a youth minister opening.  I also know that this church pays over double what I am getting now.  This further sucks, because I would love to apply for the job and get paid what i want to be paid doing what I want to do, but that would be very unfair to Old Capitol.  Since we just started a special youth-focused worship service 3 months ago, and we are getting ready to start a Friday night program.  Also, I still feel that Old Capitol is where God wants me.  I just wish there could be some way out of substitute teaching . . .

      So Ujournal blew up or something, and I moved here.   In a few short sentences here is a recap of what happened the past couple weeks:  I directed a church camp, and it went well.  Then I went to the brickyard 400 which was fun.  I had a my fourth job interview of the summer and I am anxiously awaiting my sixth "we don't want you" letter of the summer.   My brother stayed with me over the weekend.  Lot of video games were played (we racked up a body count that had to be in thousands).  On Saturday we played in a Softball tourney and saw Alien vs. Predator (it rocked).  And that is it.   The problem about being here, is no one knows it and until the link gets fixed on  urlLink http://www.lomn.com .  no one will come.  Oh well.
