      I'm lazy. Honestly, I dunno what to write. I'm a bit confuse. Confuse about how I really feel. Classes would about to start in a week or so. And I feel that i'm not ready yet. Clouds of dread starts to form over my head..Eep..  Wahaha! I'll no longer use  Xanga . Mark.my.words. I'll just open it once in a while. It's difficult to insert HTML tags there. I'm having a hard time since i'm not really good at it.

      My day didn't turned out well because of something..Well, it was really annoying. Can't tell you what it is because it's too personal.  My site's really  improving . Look at it now, it looks better than it is yesterday. I've signed for a Xanga account again. I think i'll use it as my Blogsite `cuz there are so many things i could do there. Eer, honestly, it's better than Blogspot.   Naughty gurl should rest nah! Bye!

      Yesterday, i didn't get the chance to go online. I'm so annoyed about it. I just can't last a day without surfing the net. This morning, i opened my Friendster account, and i was surprised to found out that i already have  28  friend requests,  4  testimonials, and  6  messages. Not long after that, i again received messages... Haha!   Hmmm..That's it..  Whatever!

       There was a girl, who's world was made of dreams, and wishes she lived in them, until one day she woke up, and saw the reality that gripped her. The veil of dreams, and wishes fell, and she saw the awful truth The reality was the opposite of the dreams and wishes It was harsh and cruel and it hurt. So she forgot her dreams, and her wishes and she let reality  choke her until she gave up and now all that's left of her dreams, and wishes are the tears that silently roll      down           her cheeks    ^For me, that poem was great. I found the poem when I was browsing at Gurl.com. Hope y’all like it.

      I’m really unhappy about my life. It’s really disappointing. Imagine, being stuck on our house for two hot months. Nothing special has happened. Nothing. Oh, what a summer bummer! Our class starts on June 7. But I feel a little less glum as the rainy days of June chase away what’s left of the summer sun. Why? It’s just because I wasn’t able to enjoy and make the most of it. I think this is my worst summer ever. If only I could turn back the hands of time, maybe my life wouldn’t be as miserable as it is right now. On the bright side, this summer gave me the opportunity to think about things that matter in my life. Things that would make an immense change in my life. Because this past year, I’ve made big choices that I’m regretting up to now. And this school year would give me a chance to start again. I’m really excited about it.   Hope that I’ll be off to a good start!

      Uh-oh!   Well, this is my second time to sign up here in Blogspot. I've already tried other  blogsites but i think  Blogspot  is  really  the best. Woohoo! Anyway, in this site, you'll learn something about me, things that i wouldn't normally say..`cuz oftentimes, i tend to mess up verbally..that's why sometimes i prefer being quiet and i just end up bottling up my feelings..
