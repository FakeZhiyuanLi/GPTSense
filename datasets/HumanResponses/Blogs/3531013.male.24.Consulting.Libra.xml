      When I went into a pre-anaesthetic check-up a week before an operation, the intern at the hospital told me that I had a low pulse rate. "Is that bad doctor"? , I exclaimed. "No , not at all, its good in fact", retorted the doc.   "Is it that you take up physical exercise regularly"? Oh yes, I do!!  so there's some reward in my conscious pursuit of fitness and related activities. I grew up playing sports, badminton, cricket, hockey, football, marbles, chess, kite-flying, volleyball, You name it, I played it. Though variety galored, discipline and structure lacked. Then there was time when I submerged myself into the deep sea of academics. My study table became my life and my only change from my "hideout" was the post-lunch walk with my bro.  But it changed all in college, cos then I took to structured sport but that too under an academics shadow. Sports require equipments, arena and most importanly , atleast one competent partner if not a full size team. If you play it hard, you lose the fun. If you take it too easy, you never improve. So I shifted to solo exercising that jelled better with my nature of "flying solo". So cricket, football were out and in came jogging, stretching,sprinting, working-out, cycling, Yoga, swimming, wall-practice in tennis + shadow practice in badminton were in. Set your own targets and surpass them and then raise the bar, isn't it simple enough to be applied everywhere in life.  Fitness is integral to my life. I attempted a valiant shot at qualification for an Everest trip while in my post-grad. I ran 5 kms in 24.5 minutes when I struggled to complete 4.4 kms in my undergrad. Yoga on weekends, badminton shadow 3 times a week, gym for the other three days , that was rougly my routine in post-grap college.  I am out of college now, and I still have a nice portfolio of fitness related activities. But most other don't." Have no time", my sleep is too dear to me", " I would rather diet my fat away", " How can you not eat french fries!!!", "Yoga is hazardous if not done under a teacher" , "There are no open spaces around my house". " What can be more boring then running alone"? "This is my last cigarette today", "Water might not be pure enough, let's play safe, have a pepsi", " I can't think before I've had two cups of coffee"...ufffffff.. These are some lame excuses for those who do not care to make fitness a part of their lifestyle. "Heck, who are the tryin to fool"!! I say.    I as you might have guessed lie at the extreme end. I do not indulge, be it spicey restaurant food, be it trendy clothes, be it hip lifestyle, be it genx gizmos. And I feel that people who like to keep things simple and don't run around luxuries can develop that self-drive to reach those higher levels of body-mind co-ordination, breath control and flexibility that yoga and other fitness exercises aim ultimately at.  This blog is gonna run long!!! That's just the beginning of the making of a treatise :)

      "I posted my blog, that's fine. But who's gonna read it??"Yes, that's precisely the question. I have made it a point to spend about 45 minutes of my precious professional time on writing my blog. But this site, and no blogging site, for that matter does not claim to be maintaining a public directory of blogs, where you could search blogs by kyewords, or by spirit, or by the nationality of the poster. Instead, what you have to do is to pass on the URL of youre blog to your friends and hope with your fingers crossed that they read those blogs. Inevitably, you will end up incorporating elements from you private life into the blog and then who knows, the blog hogs the peace out of your life.  So, this model means that no stranger in the world would read my blogs, unless my blog appears on the "hot blogs of the day" list on blogger.com. I beg to argue that it should be the popularity of the blog, measured by the number of people who read it, and not the discretion of the site administrator that decides which blogs are to displayed to the blog-surfer. Cos if the bloger sys-ad has his way, he would be single-handedly responsible to stop me from becoming the greatest celebrity blogger in the world. I will take up that challenge pal!!!  My arguement fails if there is a great deal of literary quality associated with the blogs that make it to the featured blogs section. Its my honest opinion, that is not the case. I have been and will remain humble and unassuming all my life, except when I am under the internet cloud of anonymity.  So, bloggers of the world, do support me on my march towards a blogocracy!

      I wonder what blogs are ? and what makes them so popular? isn't it rational to assume that why would a rational person want to know about the life of a not so rational person?? i have heard blogs make interesting reading. But I wonder if this interest transcends cultural, national and societal boundaries. This plain simple means that a blog-reader would be only interested in the blogs of people who are roughly like him.  But there is one interesting utility of blogs that one can think of. It helps you learn from others mistakes, but again I wonder how many people actually post blogs about what did they wrong?? that's dated, all of us gen-x youths will say. Or else, may be it helps give vents to one's thoughts with the "fluid" directed twowards no particular audience, one does not have to , like in a public speech or address , try very hard to hold on to the audience's attention as the audience who "take seats" in the virtual auditorium are by default interested.  I guess a lot many people use blogs to show their authority of literature and impress the opposite ( or same, for the elite few) sex. Some do it just because they have established blog-friendships that starts kind of a healthy competition between rival bloggers. There could be more weird reasons to write blogs, as I am writing this one just because someone told me that if i write one, I will get the much sought after invitation to exclusive gmail membership. Picking up from a radio mirchi ad, KV, you are telling the truth na :)  so that was my first little blog! I hope it makes interesting reading for some netizens. And sometimes in my dreams , I hope to become a writer. May the first seeds be sown proper... ahem!!!

      13th of June, but the day was going fine for me. Received long separated college friend MB at 11.00, and then we set out on a temple trip doing touristgiri in south west delhi. Starting from the Qutab Minar, we rode ahead to the Chhatarpur temples where MB started feeling the heat and we decided to return. I still maintain that the day was going fine.  2 hrs rest back at home and then the short trip to the Bahai Temple. The bug struck in the middle of the journey and I called miss DS on her cell. "Ma'am is busy, can't u see????", my cell yelled. "Okie", I said. Repeated calls 3-4 times , no reply. Reached Lotus temple, there she calls. I told her," We are close to your home, drop by and we will enjoy the calm". I was wise enough to have taken a committment of MB that the latter will not interfere provided DS blesses me with her company. She said , " My car is in repairs, can you just hang around and check back".  I was done with seeing the Lotus temple and seen off MB too, then I decided to be proactive and arrange , what else, a dinner. So there we meet at 8.20 in front of HSBC, GK-I. She picked me up in an auto.  "So, how is Mr. PwC?" Dumb that I am, I never knew whether she referred to the largest professional services firm or the smallest entity in the workforce of the firm that sat nervous at her side.  Next bombshell, "Till when are you out tonight"? Excuse me! I thought! what is that supposed to mean??Mr. PwC ( now I know) dumbfounded again. I murmured something that i didn't want her to hear. I had hardly settled when I got rattled.  "Don't you look into the eyes of the people when you talk to them?" Disastrously short of breathing space, I defended,"Well!!" It is not possible to look so much into the eyes of a person who is sitting at your side, and not in front".  A logical answer from an IITian, isn't it?  "I have no money, would you pay up the mechanic?" ."Of course, I will". Retorted the chivalrous Mr. PwC.  We drove ahead, when DS forgot whether she had paid the autowallah or not. My mind tried in vain to calculate the risk associated with a double payment :). She asked the autowallah and he was thankfully honest in admitting the receipt of 100 rupees.Somwhere then we  decided that we will see "Laws of Attraction" at PVR, so to say.  Come Garage and I find myself examining the old Maruti 800 from all angles , trying to establish the service quality offered by the roadside mechanic having myself driven only for about 75 kms all my life. Satisfied ( we had no option) , we were presented with a bill of 1250/- . Bargain galored , of both the male and female varieties. Finally, we settled for 1000/- . There you go, the fun didn't even start and my wallet goes lighter by "1 rand", exactly the way DS puts it.  We drove on and then came the revelation that she did not want to go to a movie. "I am in a real bad mood tonight, you have met me on the wrong day". CAM , as they say in IIMC, cannot agree more! " I need a break, what about having some beer". Beer??? I thought.. " Where are we ( I meant her) gonna have it"? Right here , she said. In the meantime, I had to sit in the sultry environs of the "AC fitted but left unoperated at the discretion of the owner" car while she drew money from the ATM to pay me back.  We go round the Amity international and she spotted a beer shop. " Can you go and fetch a beer for me??" I was in deep thoughts, should I or should I not. The devil inside me pinched," You fool! this is your first date, there's no harm in doing her the favour". So I collected the specs and marched towards the beer shop. It was crowded like hell. But that was my maiden visit to a beer shop, so I did not have a precedent to refer to. I kept repeating the name, Legend beer, so that I do not forget it and tried to muscle my way at the head of the counter. But despite months spent at the gym, I could not muscle past the booz maniacs to reach the counter and was sweating like a pig.  She had pity on me when i came back empty -handed. What if there is not beer, lets have some narial pani. I exclaimed, "Nariyal Pani in Delhi?" And there she gave me the American retort, of answering a question by a question. "Who said that you won't find Nariyal Pani in delhi".   Okie, Nariyal pani, in the service of the lady. 12 Rs. per piece, any other guy, I wud have said that's straight away 100% costlier than what we had in kgp. But then when you are sitting in car and ordering,you can't bargain. Can you?  "Let's eat something light", she chuckled."What would you like to have?". I kept lookign at my watch, what wud become of my early morning work-out. You wud have never heard of the gal asking the guy, "Hope you are not getting too late." Poor me, i was on the receiving end when the sun rose from the west.  So after nariyal pani, she finally gave some regard to my wishes. We kept driving to the sagar ratna close to my home sweet home in MNagar. By this time, my head was replete with a collection of the most forgettable moments I had on my life and was busy trying to position this "date" at its appropriate position. "Why the hell did I ask dare to ask a Delhi girl out??" , I was asking myself in despair.  When we reached sagar ratna, I was for the first time looking for a place to park the car. First attempt unsuccessful, I was looking for another place. A momentary lapse of concentration, and now I was looking for the car itself!!! The pessimist that I am, I could not find it hard to assume that the gal has had enough of an out-of-time small towner and fled off.  But my travaial was not going to be so short lived. She reappeared having parked the car outside. We climbed the stairs to sagar ratha - south Indian. Story after this does not have much spice, except for her revelations as how she stayed out during her HSBC days till night with friends, hung around in pubs and climbed the gate to enter at 3 in the night in her flat. In the middle, I had a smirk on my face. She asked , "why the smile?". "Nothing", I said. " Be quiet right now and be prepared not to meet me again". "My pleasure", I wish I had said. But that was not to be. People like me would decide on a location ,set out for it and reach there, come what may. She was at the opposite end of the spectrum, her idea was to just hang around and changed destinations at the drop of a hat, leading her hapless date dazed and confused.    I sustained the conversation by coming out straight. "This is not the way I have been brought up and nor do I wish to let this metropolitan culture take over my faculties, you might have a similar upbringing as me ,okay! But you allowed the evils :P to influence you and now you can't live without it." She tried in vain to impose her "we are similar" over my "we are different". I left her at around 11.10 in the night guiding her to the geetanjali road. "While leaving , she said," I had a good time with you". And I was dumbstruck as ever. Sometimes at the start of the date she had mentioned," I had thought we would never meet again". I wish we never did.
