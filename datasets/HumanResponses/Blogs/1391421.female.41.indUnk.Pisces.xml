        Goodbye to a Great Lady     New York Times  Katharine Hepburn, the actress whose independent life and strong-willed movie characters made her a role model for generations of women and a beloved heroine to filmgoers for more than 60 years, died yesterday at her home in the Fenwick section of Old Saybrook, Conn. She was 96 and also had a home in Manhattan. Her physical presence was distinctive, her often-imitated voice filled with the vowels of a well-bred New Englander, and her sharp-planed face defined by remarkably high cheekbones. In her youth she did not have classical leading-lady looks, but a handsome beauty. In old age she was a familiar figure with her hair, gradually changing from auburn to gray, always in a topknot and her boyish figure always in the trousers that she helped to make fashionable.  urlLink    read more.....

        Instructions on how to beat the summer heat:   1) Get yourself a Sauna - Tub (Barrel like container, holds about 250 gallons of water). 2) Fill the Sauna-Tub with rain water. 3) Place a plastic garden chair in the sauna tub. 4) Obtain a pewter beer mug (careful, once you have had a beer out of a pewter mug, you will never want a glass again - I don't know why but beer tastes best out of pewter). 5) Fill the mug. 6) Change into bathing attire. 7) Enter the Tub and have a seat - see below:

      This is Sebastian, Jen's son. Seems he kinda got lost inside this huge football jersey. Sebastian plays soccer and is on the honor roll at school. Jen, I know there is a story to this photo.....

      Sorry, have to post this. I know I did a blond joke yesterday, but Jen sent me this and it is just too good.  A man was in his front yard mowing grass when his attractive  blonde female neighbor came out of the house and went straight to the  mailbox.  She opened it then slammed it shut &stormed back in the house. A little later she came out of her house again went to the mail  box and again, opened it, slammed it shut again. Angrily, back into the house she went.  As the man was getting ready to edge the lawn, here she came out again, marched to the mail box, opened it and then slammed it closed  harder than ever. Puzzled by her actions the man asked her, "Is something wrong?"  To which she replied, "There certainly is!"  (Are you ready? .... this is a beauty - read below .)       My stupid computer keeps saying, "YOU'VE GOT MAIL."

      A blonde was speeding in a 35 mile per hour zone when a local police cruiser pulled her over and the officer walked up to the car.  The female police officer also happened to be a blonde and she asked for the blonde's driver's license.   The driver searched frantically in her purse for a while and finally said to the blonde policewoman, "What does a driver's license look like?"   Irritated, the blonde cop said, "You dummy, it's got your picture on it!"   The blonde driver frantically searched her purse again and found a small rectangular mirror down at the bottom.  She held it up to her face and said, "Aha!  This must be my driver's license," and handed it to the blonde policewoman.   The blonde cop looked in the mirror, handed it back to the driver and said, "You're free to go.  And, if I had known you were a police officer too, we could have avoided all this hassle."

      It is amazing to me how quickly a four-day weekend can pass. Here it is Sunday night already, and tomorrow I've to put my nose back to the old grindstone. Ugh. Jen, I tried calling you today but you weren`t home and your answering machine wasn't on either. Will try again next weekend. Didn't catch any fish this weekend, kinda frustrating, but if they aren't biting there isn't a damn thing you can do. Well, go and buy one I guess, but that's beneath my principles. Finally called Dad today, figured I'd make it a round week of being late to congratulate him. I don't think he was upset. Mom told me its been raining there since April 27, and everything is kinda floating away.  Here, we have been having summerly temperatures since the end of April, which are way over normal levels here. Usually it rarely goes above 80, we have had days in a row of 88 - 90 degrees. Kinda nice, the geraniums are growing, the tomatoes are six feet high, and thanks to Mom's seeds, I have got melons! (no outta line comments here, folks). Does anyone out there have construction plans for a winding staircase? If so let me know, as renovations are planned here for July and we will be putting one in so that I can access the upper level of the house (instead of the ladder I've so fondly grown accustomed to). Gotta go outside and enjoy the rest of this wonderful summer evening....

      Grin. The post below is, for those of you who do not speak German, Uwe's account of a large brown slug, which I had seen twice while fishing late in the evening recently.  I saw it once, while I was keeping my eye on my bobbers, out of the corner of my eye as the slug crept out of the underbrush. The second time I saw him was 20 minutes later, hanging 3/4 of the way in my freshly opened can of beer.  (No, I didn't drink the rest after removing the slug). ugh.  Today is a holiday here (not in all of Germany, just in Bavaria). Bavaria has a few more holidays than Germany due in part to the large catholic population.  So, I'm off to go do the holiday thing.....

      Aus meinem Nachtleben !  Wie so oft sitze ich gedankenversunken angelnd am Weiher und starre ins Wasser, hoffe das sich der Schwimmer bewegt, ein Fischlein sich regt. Doch nichts passiert nur das Schilf um mich herum raschelt im Wind. Ich döse vor mich hin, noch einen Schluck Bier aus der Dose. Plötzlich, beinahe neben mir, es ist schon fast dunkel kam etwas aus dem Schilf. Nackt, ohne alles räkelte sich sein tiefbrauner Körper hinter mir auf dem Steg. Was ist zu tun ? Selten war ich mit so offener Nacktheit neben mir konfrontiert.  Ich werde dich einfach ignorieren auch wenn du jetzt deinen Oberkörper anhebst, mich anstarrst. Ja, ich finde dich schön aber jetzt will ich eigentlich nichts mit dir zu tun haben, vor allem da du dich so total nackt und heimlich angeschlichen hast und und mich jetzt herausfordernd anstarrst. Ich möchte nur angeln und in Ruhe mein Bier trinken, mach du was du willst und wenn du mich belästigst schubs ich dich ins Wasser. Ist ja wohl die Höhe, nicht mal beim Angeln ist man vor euch sicher. So, ich trinke jetzt mein Bier und du neben mir kannst machen was du willst, ich ignoriere dich einfach auch wenn du mich weiterhin anstarrst. Ich öffne eine frische, noch kalte Dose Bier, geniesse einen Schluck stelle die Dose neben mich und widme mich wieder meinem Schwimmer. Hinter mir bleibt alles ruhig, ich drehe mich um, niemand mehr da, gottseidank, ich bin erleichtert, greife zu meiner Bierdose und bekomme fast einen Schock. Du Miststück du nacktes, du bist ja noch da.  Zur Hälfte hängt sie in meiner frisch angetrunkenen Bierdose, dieses braune, nackte Schneckenvieh. Nicht mich wollte sie mit ihren gierigen Blicken, nein, auf mein Bier warst du scharf du nackter Kriecher. Ich schüttele sie weg von meiner Bierdose, hinein in den Teich, trinke Wasser du Biest !

      Have decided to make a deal with Dad to celebrate future Father's Days in May. That is the german Father's Day and I am sure I will remember it then.  Look who's blogging.

      Of course I didn't call him from work either. Forgot. Duh.  Someone asked me about the knitting link to the left. Yes, I have taken up knitting. I knitted about 14 pairs of socks this winter. After the first pair I was hooked. Guess it was kinda therapeutic for me, kinda helped me ease the stress at work. Once you've worn a pair of hand-knitted socks in the winter, you will never want to wear others, believe me. And they really aren't difficult, once you've gotten the concept. If anyone needs instructions, I will be glad to send them. I might take orders, ask me, it can't hurt!  Today was a great day. Uwe's second quarterly post-chemo checkup showed no new growths. He is cooking sicilian pasta for us tonight and we will be celebrating with a nice cold rose from the south of France to accompany our pasta.

      Ugh. Monday morning and actually I gotta get to work.   Am always doing the wrong thing at the wrong time. Tried to call Jen yesterday, only got her answering machine.   Should have called Dad, yesterday was Father's Day. Called last week, but it was a week too early. (In Germany, Father's Day is in May, which is why I have trouble keeping track of this holiday.)  Hope he isn't upset, will call him today - which is difficult, due to the time difference. Will have to call from work in order to catch him at lunch time.   So, Dad, if you are checking the site, Happy Father's Day to you!

      Ok, folks. Have decided to restrict my political activities to my blog at "Never Be Silent" and provide you here with the usual amount of stuff about me, families, foto galleries, comics, poems, odd stuff, news about my latest biggest fish and so on.  In short, am itching to do some funny stuff again.  On this page, I will just let politics "kma".  I hope that there will be some contributions from my friend Jennifer (we went to High School together in Munich anno 1976).  Anyone is welcome to contribute - send me an email and I will set up a posting account for you. I mean all of you, Gene, Dad, Pat, Mom, Alex, Sylvia, Uwe, and so on and so forth.....   This is up until now my big catch of the season.....     'twas a Rainbow Trout with 2.250 grams (about five american pounds). Yes, it was tasty (though I just about had a coronary reelin' her in.....)  Give me a few days time to get up and running here with links and fotos, and feel free to contribute or mail me for posting access!

      Hey Folks! Haven´t been posting much actually, cause being able to type with one hand isn´t a lot of fun. It`s my own fault however, one should be more careful with newly purchased kitchen knives. Though the doctor did the sutures quite nicely actually.  Sutures will be removed on Wednesday, am confident that I will be somewhat better equipped to at least partially use the right hand at that point. Aaaaaarrrrgggggghh!

       Subject: Ladies vs. Women      Ladies:  If you accidentally over-salt a dish  while it's still cooking, drop  in a peeled potato and it will absorb the excess salt for an instant  "fix-me-up."   Real Woman:  If you over-salt a dish while you are cooking, that's too damn bad. Please recite with me, The Real Women's motto: "I made it and you will  eat  it and I don't care how bad it tastes."     Ladies:  Cure for headaches: Take a lime, cut it in half and rub it on your  forehead. The throbbing will go away.   Real Woman:  Take a lime, mix it with tequila, chill and drink. You might  still have the headache, but who cares?      Ladies:  Stuff a miniature marshmallow in the bottom of a sugar cone to  prevent ice cream drips.   Real Woman:  Just suck the ice cream out of the bottom of the cone, for Pete's sake. You are probably lying on the couch, with your feet up eating it anyway.    Ladies:  To keep potatoes from budding, place an apple in the bag with the  potatoes.   Real Woman:  Buy boxed mashed potato mix and keep it in the pantry for up to  a year.    Ladies:  When a cake recipe calls for flouring the baking pan, use a bit of the dry cake mix instead and there won't be any white mess on the outside of the cake.   Real Woman:  Go to the bakery -- they'll even decorate it for you.    Ladies:  Brush some beaten egg white over pie crust before baking to yield a beautiful glossy finish.   Real Woman:  Sara Lee frozen pie directions do not include brushing egg whites over the crust, so I just don't do it.    Ladies:  If you have a problem opening jars, try using latex dishwashing gloves. They give a non slip grip that makes opening jars easy.   Real Woman:  Go ask the very cute neighbor guy to do it.   And finally the most important tip...     Ladies:  Don't throw out all that leftover wine. Freeze into ice cubes for future use in casseroles and sauces.    Real Woman:  Leftover wine??

      I think Jen is trying to cheer up in light of her upcoming birthday, cause she sent me this:   The Perks of Being Over 40     - Kidnappers are not very interested in you.   - In a hostage situation you are likely to be released first.   - No one expects you to run into a burning building.  - People call at 9PM and ask, "Did I wake you?".  - People no longer view you as a hypochondriac.   - There is nothing left to learn the hard way.   - Things you buy now won't wear out.   - You can eat dinner at 4PM.   - You can live without sex but not without glasses.   - You enjoy hearing about other peoples' operations.   - You get into heated arguments about pension plans.   - You have a party and the neighbors don't even realize it.   - You no longer think of speed limits as a challenge.   - You quit trying to hold your stomach in, no matter who walks into the room.   - You sing along with elevator music.   - Your eyes won't get much worse.   - Your health plan is beginning to pay off.   - Your joints are more accurate meteorologists than the national weather service.   - Your secrets are safe with your friends because they can't remember them either.   - Your supply of brain cells is finally down to manageable size.  Lolololol, grin.

      I know, I know. I just haven't been posting at all lately. However, the pictures below will give you a clue as to what I have been doing all week. Dad and I expanded the loft in the house. We thought this was going to be a 1-2 day project. Yo. We spent all of the first day just mounting and unmounting and remounting etc. etc. the support beams. By the time the floorboards were layed on the next day, I realized I was going to have to do some heavy duty sanding on the old floor, otherwise, I'd have half the room with a dark floor and half the room with a light floor. So, all of Wednesday, I sanded, and sanded. When it was finally finished, I decided to put some furniture upstairs that had been downstairs and vice versa. Chaos. Absolute chaos. Now, most of the dust has been wiped away, below some of the pictures (and check out the finished loft at the bottom). Big hug and thanks to Dad for his untiring efforts :-)    Ladder, up, ladder down.....    Chaos on both floors......    That dusty old dust...... (even visible on the camera lens on this picture)    These two were confused as heck about what was going on.......    Ain't it a beauty!

      The Summer of the Century (somehow it seems). We have had temperatures between 75-80° F since the beginning of May, sometimes even hotter, with very little rain.  There are huge cracks in the ground in the lawn. However, my roses and melons are loving this. I am too. The next three weeks are mine - these are the three weeks I look forward to the entire year - three weeks with no obligations, no musts, just my jeans-cut-offs and my garden, three weeks barefoot and outside. The vet said our dog is too fat. We've been giving him diet food rations for four months now and he just isn't losing an ounce. Thinking this might be due to the fact that he lies around and sleeps all day (especially in the summer heat), I got my inliners out of the closet yesterday and put him through some fitness training. Ta da - even without breaking any of my bones, ain't that amazing? I have got to practice using those strange brakes, I think I loosened up at least four traffic signs trying to slow my pace on the way home.........

      The story belonging to the jersey, in Jen's own words:  "The Tennessee Titans Jersey that Sebastian is wearing in that picture is a legitimate football jersey wore by whoever the football player is – his Big Brother Rick some how or other got the jersey and took a picture of Sebastian wearing it – I thought it was great the way it devoured him!  Matter of fact it was taken the very same day that Sebastian appeared [NOT for the first time either] on the Talk of the Town [local newsy kind of talk show] Sebastian and Rick were talking about the merits of what it means to have a Big Brother/Little Brother – it is however the very first time that I have actually SEEN him on the show – everyone else in the world sees my kid but ME – I have heard about it over the course of over 2 years when he and Rick have made various appearances on the news promoting Big Brother/Big Sister and I either never knew about the airing of the show OR flat out missed the thing – so it was exciting for me to FINALLY see this airing – even some stranger also remembered seeing him on the show – just as long as he stays level headed about this minor celebrity thing and takes it all in stride than it’s ALL good!"

      There's something kinda strange about growing jalapenos in Bavaria. Thanks to Mom, who sent me the seeds in early spring. Thanks to our incredible summer (which regrettably killed about 10.000 people in France) I have the largest Jalapenos I have ever had. You see, it is impossible to get a decent salsa here. You can buy salsa ready made, but it just isn't salsa. There is always a bunch of sugar in it and it is really thick, both of which salsa should not be. So yeah, when I do tacos, I have to grow a few jalapenos first. Then, I take the last tomatoes of the season and make a two gallon pot of salsa which then lasts all year. I freeze the salsa in small portions so that there is always something ready when I need a jalapeno kick.  Will be carrying the laptop and webcam out and post a small video of my jalapenos here for mom.  (yes, I am kinda bored today somehow).

       Last Weekend....   the dust from my floor sanding attack had just settled and been cleaned up and the house was, after three weeks, once again dust free.  I knew something was up when Dad came over with a yardstick in his hand. He only does that when he is bored and looking to improve/repair/build something.  Here are the pics.  How to install a larger window  Step 1: Get the chainsaw,    Step 2: Just take out pieces of the wall,    Step 3: Smile for the camera,    Step 4: Enjoy the view!    The dust has, in the meanwhile settled again. ;-)

      What a godawful week. My finger is now better, however, the ligament is a bit short so I am in phys rehab to get that finger back working. As if that wasn't enough, I had to fight for three days to get rid of the Lovesan/Msblast virus which somehow found its way into my computer and constantly insisted on restarting the system every five minutes or so. Am back. And here is something really good (thanks Jen). You Know You're Living in the Year 2003 when...        1.  Your reason for not staying in touch with family is because they do not have e-mail.   2.  You have a list of 15 phone numbers to reach your family of three.   3.  Your grandmother asks you to send her a JPEG file of your newborn so she can create a screen saver.   4.  You pull up in your own driveway and use your cell phone to see if anyone is home.   5.  Every commercial on television has a web site address at the bottom of the screen.   6.  You buy a computer and 3 months later it's out of date and sells for half the price you paid.   7.  Leaving the house without your cell phone, which you didn't have the first 20 or 30 (or 60) years of your  life, is now a cause for panic and you turn around to go get it.   8.  Using real money, instead of credit or debit, to make a purchase would be a hassle and take planning.   9.  You just tried to enter your password on the microwave.   10.  You consider second-day air delivery painfully slow.     11.  Your dining room table is now your flat filing cabinet.   12.  Your idea of being organized is multiple-colored Post-it notes.   13.  You hear most of your jokes via e-mail instead of in person.   14.  You get an extra phone line so you can get phone calls.   15.  You disconnect from the Internet and get this awful feeling, as if you just pulled the plug on a loved one.   16.  You get up in the morning and go online before getting your coffee.   17.  You wake up at 2 AM to go to the bathroom and check your E-mail on your way back to bed.   18.  You start tilting your head sideways to smile. ; )   19.  You're reading this and nodding and laughing.   20.  Even worse; you know exactly who you are going to forward this to...

      Gotta call Mom today to see if she's boarded up the windows yet. Just checked the hourly forecast for her town, looks like the hurricane action will be peaking at 3 a.m. on Friday with heavy rain and winds at 57 mph.  For a change, we are again having lovely weather, sunny and 75 degrees and I bet it's got something to do with the fact that the Oktoberfest will be opening on Saturday afternoon.   Here some stats from last year: 5.9 million visitors consumed 5.7 million liters of beer and 459.259 chickens. Since most visitors have more than one "Maß" of beer (one liter), this means some visitors actually did not drink any beer. Odd, isn't it?  Here a few pics:              For those of you who want to know more, go to  urlLink  Official Oktoberfest Website   - everything in english as well.

        Malaysian Curry Chicken   This is a recipe I discovered a few years ago, which I like to make quite often actually as it is incredibly tasty and wonderfully easy and quick.  Here's what you need: - Skinned chicken breasts (1 per person) - 1 Can of Coconut Milk or better yet, Coconut Cream  (see  the Asian section of the supermarket) - a 2-inch piece of fresh ginger (ginger powder comes nowhere near fresh) - couple of garlic gloves - 5 pineapple rings - curry (about 4 Tbsp) - turmeric powder (about 3 Tbsp) - cayenne chili, crushed - 1 cup of beef broth  Cut the chicken breasts into mouth-sized pieces and sautee (if you are using teflon coated pans, you will need no oil). Add the peeled ginger (diced). Add garlic cloves, crushed or diced. Crush a cayenne chili into the pan (or more, depending on how hot you can stand - it should not be too hot, just somewhat spicy). I usually add three cayenne, but I'm used to eating hot. After having sauteed all of these ingredients, stir in the beef broth, then the coconut milk. Season with turmeric and curry. Cut the pineapple into bite sized pieces and add. Let simmer for 20 - 30 minutes, then remove from heat and thicken up a bit with corn starch - not too much. Return to heat until thicker. Serve with rice (preferably Basmati). This dish tastes so wonderful because of the extreme different aromas of the ingredients - coconut and curry, pineapple and cayenne. Try it - it is one of my favorites and absolutely delicious.  Let me know how you liked it!

                I don't know about you folks, but I sure am going to miss him.   .....Known as the "The Man in Black" to millions of music fans around the world, Cash struggled up from Depression-era sharecropper roots and became a true folk hero by listening to the myriad marginalized voices around him and setting them to song.  "Johnny Cash was a guy who was really an American cultural icon," said longtime Atlanta country music disc jockey Rhubarb Jones.  "What I loved about Johnny Cash is ... Johnny Cash had a great sense of humor -- a very funny guy," Jones told his listeners on Eagle 106.7 this morning. "We're not going to mourn his passing, we're going to celebrate his life."  urlLink  From the Atlanta Journal Constitution    ...."U2's Bono noted, "Nothing is as macho as Johnny Cash's voice. A real threat you will not find in a 22-year-old. You just won't. You can dress him up in leather pants, you can have him throw his TV out the hotel window. He can roar in front of all manner of white noise, but there's no real threat when you're a teenager, when you're in your 20s or when you're [in your] 30s. The real sh--, or what they say in New Orleans, the other kind of sh--, comes from the perspective of being in the trenches and having been around a while. All the blues guys had it. Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, B.B. King. Johnny Cash has that and the voice of authority for me."  urlLink  From MTV         "..."All through the Air Force, I was so lonely for those three years," Cash said during a 1996 interview. "If I couldn't have sung all those old country songs, I don't think I could have made it."  Cash launched his career in Memphis, performing on radio station KWEM. He auditioned with Sun Records, ultimately recording the single "Hey Porter," which became a hit.  Sun Records also launched the careers of Presley, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis and others.  "Folsom Prison Blues," went to No.4 on the country charts in 1956, and featured Cash's most famous couplet: "I shot a man in Reno/ just to watch him die."  Cash recorded theme albums celebrating the railroads and the Old West, and decrying the mistreatment of American Indians.  urlLink  From the Melbourne Herald Sun     "...He recorded more than 1,500 songs and was the youngest person chosen for the Country Music Hall of Fame.  Cash won 11 Grammies, including the 1999 Lifetime Achievement Award and the 2002 shared Grammy for Best Country Album.   He had two singles on the country charts for 38 consecutive years, including 25 hits between 1958 and 1960.  He posted over 130 hits on the Billboard Country singles chart.  His daughters Rosanne, Tara, Cindy and Kathy and son John Carter performed with him at one time or another.   Rosanne is a country music singer-songwriter.  Cash was honored with a Kennedy Center Award in December 1996.  According to www.legacyrecords.com, he began his career as an outlaw to the Nashville establishment and came to define country music over the last 40 years.  urlLink  From Rediff-India

       Pancake Soup   I know, I know, you will all be saying ...uuughhhh.  Pancake soup is a standard soup in the Bavarian (?german?) kitchen, which I finally made for the first time the other night. Thought I would share this with you. I have eaten this soup time and again, and it is absolutely delicious on a cold evening, or as a light meal.  I never dared to try and make it before because the pancakes used are VERY different from american pancakes, heck, using those you would have something like bread soup I guess. The batter for the pancakes in this case is quite different actually. You sift one cup of flour into a bowl, make a hole in the middle. Plop three eggs into the middle, add a small amount of milk (total amount needed is 1 1/2 cups). Stir the small amount of milk together with the eggs, and begin mixing in the flour, slowly. While folding in the flour, small amounts at a time, keep adding more milk. It is less complicated than it sounds.  The batter is relatively thin, get a large frying pan (if it isnt teflon coated, you will have to heat up some oil). Anyhow, pour one soup ladle of the batter into the pan, let brown well, turn. The pancakes will be pretty large and pretty thin, this is normal. Make the pancakes one after the other. That is all there is to that.  Get a pot of beef broth, about six cups. Get that broth warm. Finely chop fresh parsley and chives (as with all fresh herbs, please add after removing the pot from heat, thus avoiding the aroma loss - fresh herb should never be cooked, always added afterward).  Cut the pancakes into thin strips (half an inch) and dont leave them too long - it is too dificult to eat the soup.  Serve the pancake stripes separately from the broth to avoid then getting too soaked up. Happy Eating!  (Let me know how it turned out - you will love it - it tastes wonderful!)

      Hey Folks. That is my very first (embarrassing to admit that at my age) animated graphic!  Yes, I know, it is extremely rudimentary and crude, but nevertheless. Perhaps the world can expect great things from me...(roflmao).  Anyhow, its better than film footage of some darned jalapenos. (Is it really?!)  Things are getting kinda "fall-like" here. It's dropped from 88 degrees to about 55 (I've got that old wood burning stove churning). Today, I saw pumpkins for sale, and in the meadows, the heather is starting to appear. Heck, it is only the first of September, but due to the extreme drought and heat we have had since spring, many of the trees are turning as well, and look like they usually do at the end of October. Guess its time to accept that the summer is somehow officially over, time to make cider and jam and pumpkin stuff.

      Sorry folks, haven't been posting very much. Am spending a lot of time knitting at the moment - got the crazy idea of knitting myself a sweater coat I saw in a knitting magazine. I get forward relatively fast because the yarn is very thick - the needles I use are as thick as ballpoint pens.  The back and most of the front are done, then I need to two sleeves and a hood so I am hoping that by the next weekend it will be done.  Knitting has become somewhat therapeutic for me - gets all of that same old working day stress of my back, gets me at peace with myself and the world somehow.  Plus its fun to be lazy and spend the day on the sofa knitting and watching TV, grin!  Anyhow, the cold and wet rainy weather we are having just forces you into staying inside, so, might as well make something productive out of it.  Oktoberfest ends today, I heard they put away 6.5 million liters of beer. Wow.

      Ugh. Think we oughta stick to burgers or such....    About a Turkey    NY Times   .......Now consider the bird that will soon be on your plate. It probably hatched in an incubator on a huge farm, most likely in the Midwest or the South. Its life went downhill from there. A few days after hatching — in the first of many unnatural if not necessarily painful indignities — it had its upper beak and toenails snipped off. A turkey is normally a very discriminating eater (left to its own devices, it will search out the exact food it wants to eat). In order to fatten it up quickly, farmers clip the beak, transforming it into a kind of shovel. With its altered beak, it can no longer pick and choose what it will eat. Instead, it will do nothing but gorge on the highly fortified corn-based mash that it is offered, even though that is far removed from the varied diet of insects, grass and seeds turkeys prefer. And the toenails? They're removed so that they won't do harm later on: in the crowded conditions of industrial production, mature turkeys are prone to picking at the feathers of their neighbors — and even cannibalizing them.   After their beaks are clipped, mass- produced turkeys spend the first three weeks of their lives confined with hundreds of other birds in what is known as a brooder, a heated room where they are kept warm, dry and safe from disease and predators. The next rite of passage comes in the fourth week, when turkeys reach puberty and grow feathers. For centuries, it was at this point that a domesticated turkey would move outdoors for the rest of its life.   But with the arrival of factory turkey farming in the 1960's, all that changed. Factory-farm turkeys don't even see the outdoors. Instead, as many as 10,000 turkeys that hatched at the same time are herded from brooders into a giant barn. These barns generally are windowless, but are illuminated by bright lights 24 hours a day, keeping the turkeys awake and eating.   These turkey are destined to spend their lives not on grass but on wood shavings, laid down to absorb the overwhelming amount of waste that the flock produces. Still, the ammonia fumes rising from the floor are enough to burn the eyes, even at those operations where the top level of the shavings is occasionally scraped away during the flock's time in the barn.   Not only do these turkeys have no room to move around in the barn, they don't have any way to indulge their instinct to roost (clutching onto something with their claws when they sleep). Instead, the turkeys are forced to rest in an unnatural position — analogous to what sleeping sitting up is for humans.  urlLink  click for complete article

         Turkeys and more.   While in the shower this morning, I realized Thanksgiving is on Thursday. Will need to be sending some cards. Genuinely American holidays like Thanksgiving are hard to track when overseas.  Anyhow, gave a thought to those millions of turkeys which have already given their lives and are labeled Butterball or whatever and will, this week, be served on millions of tables on Thursday. So, if you have bought a frozen turkey, make sure you put it out to thaw in time.  Here it is Sunday afternoon, the weekend is once again vanishing quicker than you can say turkey.  Our weather is much too mild for this time of year, beaming sunshine and 46F. Oh yeah, gotta make sure I remove the rest of those stupid leaves from the porch and the sidewalk.   Yo - regarding the "stupid things I did this week" department. Got home late from work, had to dash to a birthday, laid my wallet on the wood burning stove which was not on. Ha. An hour later I made a wonderful fire in that stove, the whole house was wonderfully warm - then I discovered my wallet still laying there. Threw the damn thing in the freezer but it didn't help. Every card in there melted and changed its form somewhat - was not able to get any money from the ATM, have ordered replacement credit cards, geeeeeez. Shit happens, I guess.

      Dog Birthdays.....  Tomorrow, Tobi will be 3. We have an invite, as every year, from his mother's owner. It is always a blast, as it was a litter of eight puppies, which have all grown into giant black macho huggables. His mom will be there as will his dad (he is never really very interested in what is going on - just lays on the sidelines and wants to be left alone). Interesting enough, Pieko, the father of the litter, is a mixed breed who looks like a yellow lab. All of his children are black and resemble black labs.  On another front. Could someone please tell me why it is so damn hard getting up in the winter? I have absolutely no problems getting out of bed in the morning in spring and summer, but this time of the year it is a daily torture, to say the least. Some of it is surely due to the fact that I still have this damn cold and have been working a lot, but still. Ugh.  Jenny and Sebastian were on TV this week - she sent me a link to the video. Wow. Cool. The subject of the report was watches with GPRS for tracking children. Does this mean that my GPRS cell phone always lets everyone know where I am?  Have to check on that one, could get me into trouble, lol.  Ok. gotta hit the showers and get myself to the office...the daily grind..................

      Another Sunday, another apology. Things have just been kinda crazy on every front here.  No one has been hearing a whole lot from me and I am sorry for that folks.  Ok, let's see, where can we catch up. Mom, thanks again for those jalapeno seeds: here a foto of my harvest:    Believe me, it aint easy growing jalapenos in Bavara, in light of our usually cool and often rainy summers. The record temperatures this year helped a lot. Regarding those round peppers in the picture, don't ask me what they are. They came, they grew and ripened. The round ones are very aromatic but aren't hot. Snuck themselves in those little buggers.  I made a huge pot of salsa today, about three gallons actually. Will be freezing that in small portions so as to have another year´s supply.  Here is a foto that really made me laugh - it's Pat+ the Gang's dog, Abby:    I have never seen a dog with three tennis balls in his mouth. Wow.  Regarding Christmas, I have promised Mom, Dad, Gene and Jen and the kids socks. Two weeks ago I had an acute bout of carpal tunnel, which has gotten me to the point of staying away from the computer as much as I can, and which has slowed me down in terms of knitting anything. Will have to go back to the drawing board on that one.  Last week, some sort of nasty virus grabbed a hold of me and kept me lying down for four days (including the weekend). The devil is on the loose at work (in a positive way) and things are just whacky.  I will better myself concerning posting here, promise.

      Oh the perks of country living. My usual Saturday schedule of cleaning, laundry, shopping, got left out today. Yeah, I didn't make it to Walmart to do all of those things....  We got four cords of wood this morning. While piling them, I was reminded of the fact that I have hamstrings. I had forgotten, actually.  I always pile the wood very carefully, my dad is the world's best wood piler (according to him). It mustnt lean forward, fill in the gaps, and so on. Well, he complimented me today. Kinda surprised me.   Four hours of piling wood is exhausting. My butt hurts from bending down to pick up logs. Yet, physical work on the weekends is a good alternative to the office job. Plus, I don't have to pay for a fitness club to stay in shape, grin.

      Friday at last. This was by far the crappiest week I have had in about three years. Yesterday was a wonderful sunny day and I was in a wonderful mood.  Followed by a flip-out shouting attack by my boss at work, followed by coming home to find the cat had puked on the freshly washed rug, followed by kind of a nervous breakdown, stupid old me crying and blubbering. Wonderful. Have decided to regroup my priorities. Everything that is of true importance to me is not work related. I need to hammer that into my thick skull. And hammer, and hammer.  Jennifer has announced she is sending me (well it sounds like about a ton) of yarn to work into some sort of afghan, so therapy is on its way.. ;-)  Anyhow, Jenny sent me these 15 things to do at Walmart, and I might just head on up there tomorrow to get rid of some of this built up anger:  1.  Get 24 boxes of condoms & randomly put them in peoples carts when they aren't looking.   2.  Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5 minute intervals.   3.  Make a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the rest rooms.   4.  Walk up to an employee and tell him/her in an official tone, 'Code 3' in housewares....and see what happens.   5.  Go to the Service Desk and ask to put a bag of M&M's on layaway.   6.  Move a 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area.   7.  Set up a tent in the camping department and tell other shoppers you'll invite them in if they bring pillows from the bedding department.   8.  When a clerk asks if they can help you, begin to cry and ask "Why can't you people just leave me alone?"   9.  Look right into the security camera, use it as a mirror and pick your nose.   10.  While handling guns in the hunting department, ask the clerk if he knows where the anti-depressants are.   11.  Dart around the store suspiciously while loudly humming the theme from "Mission Impossible."   12.  In the auto department, practice your "Madonna look" using different size funnels.   13.  Hide in a clothing rack and when people browse through, say "PICK ME!  PICK ME!"   14.  When an announcement comes over the loud speaker, assume the fetal position and scream "NO!  NO!  It's those  voices again!"   And last but not least:   15.  Go into a fitting room, shut the door and wait a while and then yell loudly "There's no toilet paper in here."

      It occurred to me yesterday, that I am actually an excellent driver.  Yes. Really. All damage inflicted on any car I have ever owned was occured while parking or while leaving a parking space. Meaning, I am an excellent driver as long as I have enough ROOM. Lol.  What got me pondering this? The excessive amounts of snow we have here - it just keeps snowing, and snowing and snowing. Driving to work in the morning (30 km) is always interesting, depending on who is in front of me. Having 10 years of Chicago experience, I can deal with snow and ice, and am always frustrated when there is an Opel in front of me with an elderly man wearing a hat doing 65 km/h (35 mph). Is it the Opel? Is it elderly men? Or does it have something to do with drivers wearing hats? Maybe its just that retired people have no schedule, don`t have to be anywhere at a certain time. But do they have to hit the road in the morning when hard-working normal people have to get to work?

      Had to add a day to the Austria trip. My boss has a strong tendency to attract disaster in all its forms (usually when he vacations, riots break out (L.A.), hurricanes appear (Bermuda), etc.). Our departure from Austria was delayed by one day because of half a meter of fresh snow. Typical, lol. Nevertheless, it gave us time to have a short look at the city of Graz, former home of one Arnold Schwarzenegger. They have named the football stadium after him. In big letters: ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER STADION. Wonder how long it will take before they place the word Governor in front of his name ;-)

      Here a correction to the chicken soup recipe - please cover the pot if you aren't using a pressure cooker and check now and then to make sure the water hasn't evaporated. Bring to a boil and then simmer.  That's that. Got the rest of the yarn which Mom sent me for Christmas along with the pattern of the afghan. Took me three weeks to decipher that pattern, but with the help of the folks at the crochet forum, I think I am on the right track.  Weekends are strange somehow. I always feel as though I just have a couple of small time blocks just for me - somewhere between the cleaning and the laundry and the ironing and what all else needs to be done.  Yesterday I finally found the perfect way to get the shower doors clean. There is always a bunch of crud which collects in the bottom frames where the panels sit. I have always just brushed them clean best as I could but yesterday - Whammo. Soaked them with a cleaning agent, then used my water pic to get all of that crud out of there. They look like new now.  Don't I have an exciting life?  Will be ironing and packing tonight as I am off to Austria for two days (deep Austria, Graz, near the Hungarian Border). It's a long drive, about 6 hours. So far into Austria that there aren't any mountains there.  Have also noticed that my blogging is not becoming more frequent. Please put the blame on my other blog, Never Be Silent, which I update daily (except for in December where I had no time to do anything).   Ok. Am off to my tub full of dead sea salt water and then into the kitchen to make some Indian Madras Curry (it's a stew, very strongly seasoned with cumin, ginger, coriander, garlic, curry, etc.) Very good eating for this crappy wet winter weather.

      Ok. Here's the soup. Jen and I talked about broth last weekend, seems she had been somewhere and they had a really great broth so we talked about my chicken soup. Here's what you need: 1 chicken (do yourself a favor and use a broiler, not a soup chicken - the broiler is juicier and has more meat) a few carrots a few leeks two onions a parsnip (looks like a carrot but is white) celery fresh parsley (comes into the soup just prior to serving)  put a bit of water (2 inches) into a large pot. Thoroughly wash the chicken, inside and out, and place it in the pot. Chop all other ingredients except parsley and add. Cook for about 1 hour. Remove the chicken from the pot and let cool. Separate meat from the bones, add the meat to the soup, add canned chicken broth or broth cubes and water to taste (a lot of water or broth - usually 4 - 6 cups). Bring to a boil, remove from heat, add chopped parsley and serve with soup noodles. Hmmmmmm. It's a great eat if the weather is cold, or when you are sick, left overs can be frozen without a problem. Let me know how it turns out if you decide to make it!

         Well, I stopped posting at Thanksgiving (and some people have been complaining, rightly so) and am starting again at the beginning of the new year. As most of you know, I have been working tons of overtime ever since the company moved its offices on November 28. I just didn't have the time or the inspiration to do anything here.  HOWEVER; having managed to also get my PC again purring like a kitten by taking the extra time during the holidays to reformat and reinstall everything, I promise to be here more often. Lost all of my old mails however.  I backed up the mail program, but when I reinstalled it, I got emails up to April 2003 and nothing after that - there is a bunch of good stuff which got lost, but will make its way back to me, I am sure. Oh well, tit for tat.  The quality of the picture above is not so good 'cause I took it with my phone on Christmas Eve to be able to send it to Mom per email instantly (which I did).  Für alle die dabei waren, Abzüge der Weihnachtsfotos sind fertig und werden jedem per Post geschickt!  Oh yeah - anyone out there know how to read complicated crochet patterns? Mom discovered a pattern for an afghan in a magazine and sent me the pattern and the yarn. If anyone is up on this stuff, perhaps Laura, drop me a line. The folks at the crochet forum at about.com weren't able to help me either. Will probably end up making it in normal granny squares.

       Strange Day, Sad Day  Yesterday was a very strange day. It was cloudy the entire day, but the sky had kind of a red hue to it, which made the greens in the grass look very dark green and generally made everything look kind of strange. Everytime I went outside I got the feelíng I was living on Mars or Saturn.  It turned out that a giant cloud of Sahara dust had been carried by high winds over Europe. Sahara dust is red, and the dust was above the clouds, and it looked very interesting yesterday. I would have taken a picture but I doubt I would have been able to capture the essence of it.  Sad news.  We got a phone call yesterday from one of the restaurant owners who is the owner of Tobi's mother (Nicki)  and one of his brothers (Wuzi) (it was a total litter of eight). They wanted to know if there was any hope of puppies from one of Nicki's children. Last week, Nicki and Wuzi had slipped away from the restaurant unnoticed and were shot at the edge of the forest by a hunter. There are no words I can use to express my anger, outrage and sorrow.   Here is a photo of Nicki at the gathering in honor of the litter's first birthday:, here, some of her children:

      OK. Have something interesting for you folks. This is actually a math exercise, elementary school level. It has fascinated me and everyone I have told about it for the last two days - everyone has their own theory of how to figure it out, there have been many heated and some very funny discussions. So, try and figure this out (I believe I have the answer). The first one to send me the proper answer will get something from me - will think of something, amazon gift certificate or such.   We have two locations, A and B. A passenger train, leaving location A needs three hours to complete the trip to location B. A freight train, leaving location B, needs four hours to complete the trip to location A.  Both trains depart their locations at 12:00 noon.  The question is, at what time will they meet along the way and continue past one another?    Much fun with this one - keep me posted ;-))

      This is good for a change. It is Saturday morning, 9.00, since I took care of cleaning yesterday, I have two whole days to just hang out and do what I want (or what has piled up, like my ironing).  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@  My wonderful aunt (who is also blond, like me) told me this blond joke yesterday - its wonderful.  A 747 takes off from Heathrow in London headed for L.A. A blonde passenger has seated herself in the first class, despite the fact that she has a ticket for economy. Three times the stewardess tries to convince the young woman to leave first class and go to her assigned seating. The blonde woman refuses - "first class is much nicer than back there".  Frustrated, the stewardess approaches the pilot and asks him for help. "No problem", he says. Two minutes later the pilot returns to the cockpit. "Did you get her to leave first class?" asks the stewardess? "Yes, it was no problem at all". "Well, how did you convince her?" "It was very easy", the pilot replies. "I told her that the first three rows only fly as far as New York".   Ha! I loved it.  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@  And guess what - I finished the afghan mom sent me the yarn for!!

        Too Much Enthusiasm....    Well, did too much cleaning yesterday and am paying for it today. My own fault. Spent all of this morning on the couch, reading, taking Ibuprofen as a prophylaxis to infection.  Darn.  Not being able to do much is difficult. Our weather is wonderfully springlike and I would really love to do some serious weeding out there, but alas, I can't.   Spring cleaning would be good too, but it is also a nono post-op this early. Yaaawwwwwnnnnnn. Yes folks, my life at the moment is just as boring as my posts.

        MUSINGS    What is it about being around 40 and the physical properties of the body? I thought about this early today. We changed to summer time last night. What got me thinking about this, was that the only clock in the house which was properly set this morning was the VCR (this is because in October when we switched to winter time, I figured it wasn't worth it changing the time on it for those few months until spring).  ((This also resulted in me serving lunch one hour too early a few months back, when I forgot that the VCR clock was still on summer time)).  Anyhow, last summer, I was able to read the clock display on the VCR without glasses. I can't do that anymore. In order to knit or do anything remotely "small-visual I need to be wearing reading glasses. Which probably also means that the visual test I took eight years ago, which supposedly determined that I need glasses in order to drive a car is now true (it wasn't then, really - my eyes were just overly stressed from loads of work at the monitor for weeks before taking the test).  Oh well. That's life I guess. I can handle this, no problem, as long as I don't get the urge to go into the bathroom and check on my receding gums..................

         Can anyone tell me where to get one of these penholders? Grin.  Thanks,  Gisi, for the smile.  My day started with a 15€ parking ticket in front of the post office this morning. Restricted parking zone  -  the parking lot of the post office was full, I was only in there for six minutes or so, but whammo. Oh well. ce la vie. I will appeal that ticket, after all, am temporarily a bit handicapped and it would have been difficult to take the car in there with me, wouldn't it?  It is high time for us to get some sunshine here, though I am not outdoors much actually. H This gray cloudy weather is depressing, not to mention the fact that we got a whole truckload of snow again a few days ago.

         This is the guy who is not getting a lot of couch time these days. Now and then when I am lying on it, he will sit next to me with such a suffering expression on his face, that I make room for him. I have actually been doing a lot of lying down, yesterday I went for a walk with him for the first time since coming home, we kept it short.  If this keeps up, by the time I get back to work, I will qualify for a three-fold bachelor's in history, marine biology and geography. Been watching Discovery Channel every day, almost all day. Somehow I still have the feeling that while my body is recovering, my mind is turning to mush.  Got seeds in the mail today from Mom. Jalapenos, Cayenne, Canteloupe Melons and Salvia in red, white and blue colors. Will have to get some of those weird little flat planting things that, when you soak them in water, get big and round (they are used for seeding). My harvest last year was very impressive, our weather was very hot and dry, let's see how it goes this year.  Dante, keep up those ravings, they are good for the soul. And please keep being you, as you are.

      Sorry to be so serious today, but news items like this need to be spread.    Canada's misguided and shameful slaughter   New Zealand Herald  On March 15th, caring and concerned citizens around the world will be faxing and emailing Canadian Government politicians and officials to express their strong opposition to the slaughter of 350,000 baby harp seals and hood seals.   This annual slaughter takes place off the east coast of Canada and is heavily subsidised by Canadian taxpayers, the majority of whom are against the brutal killing of these beautiful marine mammals.   The Canadian Harp seal hunt is the largest single mass slaughter of a mammalian wildlife species anywhere in the world.   Over one million harp seals are condemned to be cruelly slaughtered over a three-year period.   The Seal Hunt methods of kill? Clubs, picks, rifles and shotguns.   It is a grossly inhumane kill that goes mostly unregulated, as there are limited fisheries officer to watch and inspect the number of sealers on the ice. Credible witnesses have documented seals being skinned alive and tortured.  urlLink   complete article   Here is a link with email adresses of the appropriate persons in the Canadian government to whom you can send protests to; scroll to the bottom of this link for sample text.  urlLink  Sea Shepherd Org

      I forgot to tell about my birthday, didn't I.  Ok, here goes. My father gave me a Daiwa Emblem X 4500-XT spinning reel, it has a worm shaft assembly and a twist buster and a super smooth drag adjustment. Am looking forward to fishing with it. Additionally, he presented me with two electronic bite indicators (on which I will leave the volume turned way down low in order not to get the other guys fishing jealous about all the fish I am catching).    My father seems to be looking to do some serious fishing this year (I think he hasn't quite recovered from my 5-lb trout of last year). He has bought a few new reels and rods and is kinda declaring war on the sheatfish this year. For those of you who do not know what a sheatfish is, here is a picture:     This fish is also known as the European Catfish and is native to all fresh waters of Europe. The biggest one caught to date was in 1997 and weighed 62 lbs.   I caught one last year, however, it only had 50 cm in length (about 1 1/2 feet) and I returned it to the lake (it was an accidental catch, I was actually fishing for eel). The minimum length for catching this fish is 1 meter, or about three feet in length.   Getting a sheathfish in, when he is that big, takes about 3/4 of an hour, they put up a huge fight and are incredibly strong. Plus, if you aren't prepared to catch one and have the wrong type of fishing line in use or lack a steel leader, there is a risk that his "teeth" will chafe through the line.  On the culinary side, they taste absolutely wonderful.

      Lol, Dante thinks I'll be skydiving soon -  I can't even get my pants closed.  Though I lost four pounds in the hospital, my lower stomach is quite bloated (this is normal, they told me) I cannot zip any pants that I own. I guess it will be leggings for a bit longer, as leaving the house with unzipped/unbuttoned jeans is not an option.  Hm. Samoa Girl Scout Cookies. Sounds good, doesn't it. Can you mail me some?  Temperatures here have returned to normal for this time of year, much to my relief. It is very windy however, which I find irritating after a while, the shutters rattle, the wind chimes dangle, etc.  I am kinda feeling a bit in limbo at the moment - wanting to do stuff but not quite having the energy. It is a bit frustrating actually, having this much time on my hands but not really getting anything done. Might try vacuuming tomorrow, carefully and slowly.  Have read two books in three days, guess that is positive. Michael Crichton's "Prey" and Dean Koontz' "By the Light of the Moon". Gave me some weird dreams though, maybe I oughta read Seabisquit, seems a bit more harmless, Mom sent all of those to me for Christmas.  Oh, and really nice was a beautiful bouquet of flowers I received from a belgian business aquaintance, whom I have a lot of email contact with at work, but whom I have never met. That came so out of the blue and was just so nice and thoughtful of him, just kinda made my day!

        THANK YOU DANTE, for a wonderful work-up of the site, and for  all of the birthday wishes. Now all I gotta do is figure out how to get my beer to go   green :-}    It's been a rather strenous birthday actually. Temperatures here rocketed from 40 degrees this weekend to over 75 degrees today and it kinda killed my circulatory system, despite the fact that I stayed in the shade for the few minutes I was outdoors. No I didn't celebrate as I normally would, had lunch at a lakeside restaurant and then went home and napped for quite a bit on the couch. Just goes to show I guess, surgery of this sort is not to be taken lightly.  Turning 41 is having no other effect on me actually. Last year, the 40th kinda got to me and made me reflective and take count of where I was with my life and whether that was were I wanted to be. This year, my view is much more realistic and down to earth I think. Health is everything. When I checked into the hospital, I was so afraid, yes, naked, knuckle-baring fear made my eyes the size of moonbeams, that they might find something else wrong with me or some tumors somewhere or what the heck all my imagination managed to conjure up in the week approaching my hospital stay. Having have been poked, proded, ultrasonically checked all over, lab work on the blood, x-rayed, EKG'd, and having come out of there perfectly healthy (with exception of the obvious, of course) just made me feel so wonderfully relaxed and free and relieved. Birthday? 41? What, me worry? :-))))))   Oh, and the most noticeable improvement at home in relation to being at the hospital? Sleeping in my own bed, not having anyone in the room snoring, no nurses looking in at night, just sleeeeeping..................hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

      Alas, I am at home. Some idiot at the hospital managed to kill the coin-operated computer, which is why I have not been able to post the last couple of days.  Stitches were pulled out today, got home around noon to a wonderful lunch of spaghetti and a wonderful welcome by Tobi. Will be mailing all of you today and tomorrow, am somewhat tired (being home is much more relaxing than being in the hospital). Hugs, me.

      "We gotta get outta this place... if it's the last thing we ever do...."  Grin. Not sure anymore who sang/wrote that song, might have been BTO, but it's kinda how I am feeling. Yesterday was a lovely day. We had sunshine and about 60 degrees, I spent a bit of time outside walking around in the hospital garden which still looks very bare and wintery except for some crocusses.  Am feeling quite well. When I get up, I have that quasimoto kinda look for the first few steps, but then I am able to straighten up and walk properly, though slowly. Am kinda tired of changing between knitting, reading, crossword puzzles, walking through the corridors, knitting, crossword puzzles, eating, walking, etc. In other words, it's time to go home.   However, the stitches will not be pulled until Tuesday, so there is no other hope. Ok. Two more days. Gotta just handle that.  Yesterday, Tobi visited. It was so good to see him. A bit later on, we left him in the car to sit in the garden for a bit and he stared at us / me incessantly with a look that was just too much to bear. Made me cry actually. Silly, ain't I? Will be home in three days, so why cry? Auuugggghhhh.  Not much other news from here - the hospital stay is getting very monotonous, the big trick is getting the hours to pass, then the evening which just drags on. Two more days - YIPPEEEEEEEE! Hugs to all of you.

      Good morning Bavaria.  It's Saturday morning, 6.30 a.m. and I could not sleep anymore. Somehow, you just don't get really tired in a hospital. So, sleeping long is something reserved for those who sleep till noon on any given weekend.  Anyhow, left the room in order not to wake the others and got myself a cup of coffee. Hmmmm.  We spent the entire day yesterday laughing. There are four of us in the room, all about the same age, same ailment, one lady is a bit older (about 60 I think). It's interesting how a situation like this tends to take 4 strangers, throw them together, and after a few days, laugh and kid around like old friends. I was lucky to get a room like this one, we help each other get over the various bumps and problems on our way to the release out of here (kinda sounds like we are in prison, lol).  They removed the dressing yesterday (for two of us, we promptly measured the length of the incision with the tape length I brought along to measure the socks I am knitting). We laughed like heck doing it. 15 cm in length (that is about 6 inches I think).  The incision looks like it was sewn with an automatic sewing machine - on each end, there is a blue plastic "button" like thing which holds the end of the suture on that end of the incision.   I lost one of my buttons yesterday. Yup. Just fell off. Just like that.  We laughed like hell about that too. Somehow, yesterday, everything was funny to us, and though it hurts to laugh, if you hold the part of the stomach where the incision is, its ok. So there we were, four women, holding their stomachs, laughing till we had tears in our eyes.  The nurse, on her evening round, said it wasn't so bad, I just need to take care not to lose the other button too. (She taped it down with adhesive so that it would not get lost). Seems that when they remove the sutures, they just take one end of the suture with button and pull those buggers out. What the heck - nothing is throwing me anymore. Someone told me that if you get to go home relatively early, they give you the heparine injections home to administer yourself or by someone you trust? Well, this will also be an interesting experience.  I am amazed at how little pain the incision has caused. I only took pain medication the day of the operation and the day after. What really is bothersome (the others have noticed this too), is the pain in the general stomach area - everything just kinda hurts - like I did too many situps and ate too much cabbage and then someone hit me in the gut. We asked the nurse and she said that it is perfectly normal - the uterus is gone and there is a "gap" to fill if you will, during the surgery, the surgeon most likely had to shove the intestines back and forth to get everywhere he needed to, and everything just kinda needs to find its place anew. The bladder has LOTS of room now. Really odd feeling.  Food is great by the way - they are now giving me so much to eat that I cannot possibly eat it all, I think they shrunk my stomach somehow.  All in all, it has been a very interesting experience - but I cannot wait to get home on Tuesday. Big hugs to all of you, will post at least once more "LIVE AND ON THE SCENE"...... lol ;-)))

      So, am able to walk again. This is quite a feat, considering they slit my belly open (though it was not as bad as it sounds). I got operated on Monday morning, slept most of the day. Tuesday I found out, I wasn't going to get anything to drink or to eat - just IV. Wonderful. The other gals in the room got the nicest food, the most wonderful lunches, Tuesday was definitely a shitty day. Wednesday at noon I finally got to have some tea and zwieback for lunch, a bit of noodle soup for dinner. This morning it was zwieback for breakfast, noodle soup for lunch. Oh well. At least I am relatively pain free, able to walk short distances, and the operation went without a hitch. The biggest enemy in here is boredom actually.  And, trying to sleep through the night, since you arent tired. From what - laying in bed all day? Will be letting myself heard from here every day or so, (hope to be out Tuesday, that's when the stitches come out). Hugs to all of you.

Would be nicer if my roomate didn't snore. If she snores in the afternoon, what will it be like tonight? Oh. sigh. Will be a few days before posting, I don't expect to be able to walk for a few days, but what the heck.

      Well, I couldn't think of six more things. Hm. Packed. That is weird. When you are used to packing for business trips and suddenly all you need is socks, underwear and pajamas. Strange. But I am taking stuff for entertainment. A mystery by Henning Mankell, a thriller by Dean Koontz. Oh yeah, the brick game (like a cheap game boy but lets you play 10 variations of Tetris - bought it a few years back in the Czech Republic at one of those border markets). And a walkman, with lets see, I will take my Soundtrack to Out of Africa (very relaxing and soothing), Phantom of the Opera (case I get bored) and George Winston. Haven't decided on the Platters (Smoke gets in your eyes) tape yet though, might want me get up and go have a smoke somewhere in the hospital. And lots of stuff to knit socks with. So, I guess I am ready. Ha. Am signing off. I hear there are several internet sites in the klinik, perhaps I can post from there once I am somewhat back on my feet. Yo. I'll be seeing you,  in all the old familiar places........................................................

Here goes:  I would rather check into the hospital on Sunday than:  1) get married 2) get on a transatlantic flight 3) have an ISO 9001 Audit 4) have periodontal treatment  hm. Maybe I can think of six other things till then, sigh.

              Tobi, Renowned Canine Advice Specialist     Tobi's Weekly Advice Column     Dear Tobi,  I am a four year old mini-poodle and have been living with my people-family (who I call my door openers) since I was a child. I am relatively happy here, my door openers are kind enough (except for the mini door openers, they sometimes step on my tail while I am sleeping). There is a pit bull named Sarge who lives next door to us. Sarge recently told me that he gets fed twice a day, in addition to the treats and other snacks he gets in between. I only get fed once a day. Do you have any suggestions for how to get my door openers to feed me more often? Signed, Hungry in Hannover      Dear Hungry in Hannover,  There are a number of ways to accomplish this.  1) When your door openers are taking their meal, lie on the floor next to the table, but far enough away to make eye contact. Give them, one after another, long stares while furrowing your brow. This will soften them up a bit.  2) When on a walk, pretend to dig up mice in the fields. Also pretend to EAT the mice you have dug up. Use every opportunity to get the point across that you are hungry.  3) Move slowly, at all times, swaying a bit, as though you are just about to fall over from weakness.  4) Salivate excessively, and often.  5) Sit next to your empty food dish, holding your head sideways and a bit downward, while furrowing your brows as though you are suffering great pain.  HIH, these actions, carried out successively, should solve the problem. Good luck, Tobi.

        Exhausted....    I am beat. Totally. I did not expect to become soooooo tired from going back to work, but I feel about five years older than I did on Sunday. Good that it is Thursday.  I haven't caught a fish yet either, but that isn't bothering me in the least.   My highlight of the week - I won the fight with my cell phone company. While in the hospital, they tried to deduct the monthly bill but the account was not covered so the bank would not let them. Thus, they charged me, on the next invoice (even though I transfered the amount due right away) late fees and administrative fees of over 20,00 Eur.  Unbelievable. The invoice amount was only 25,00 Eur and the fees 20,00 Eur!!! I wrote them a mean email complaining that I have been a customer for eight years and there has never been a problem in paying my bills, and threatened to cancel the account. Guess that worked. They called me yesterday and are giving me a credit of 25,00 Eur for the trouble I have had. What do we learn from this? Don't take crap from anyone - open that big mouth. Yeah.  Fortiter in re, suaviter in modo.

Spent yesterday afternoon checking that all my rods and reels were in order, checked the knots, the hooks, etc. Got up at 4 a.m.  Got there at 5.30. They rang the opening bell at 7.00 a.m. At 11.30 they whistled for a stop. I went home empty handed. The little kid on my left caught a nice trout, my father, to my right, caught three. Can't believe it. Not at the opening derby!!!! :-((((  Ce la vie. Now I have a load of ironing to do and I have to go to work tomorrow.  What a yech kinda Sunday, don't cha think?

        Rainbows....    We had some really nice and warm weather on Sunday, followed by an early evening thunderstorm. As the storm was pulling away it continued to rain and the sun came back into view. I saw something that I had never seen before -  a rainbow - (yes, I have seen lots of them) but this one was a complete arch, meaning I saw both ends of it on the ground - it was in the complete shape of an upside down U.  It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.  On other fronts, not much new here. Have a list of things to accomplish this week before gettting back to work on Monday, need to get those winter tires off the car, stuff like that.  Oh, my first painting is finished. Will post a photo of it later on today.

        New:  Karen's Painting Tips   Tip of the day: Do not use the other end of the brush to mix colors together. You will inevitably forget that you have done so, and will regret it the instant you put the brush into your mouth temporarily to use another brush.  :-):-):-):-O  I have been forgetful of late. Last week, I spotted a night crawler in the garden and put him in my pocket, meaning to add him to the other crawlers we have collected for fishing bait.  I remembered the night crawler in my pocket after getting up from my afternoon nap. Yeeecchh.  Yesterday morning, my father and I went down to the river for an hour to do some spin fishing. He gave me two frozen bait fish (minnows) which I placed in my shirt pocket. I used one of them for fishing. The other one I noticed late afternoon while chatting with Jen. Am certain that, if I hadn't smelled it first, it would have ended up in the laundry hamper with the shirt.  Maybe I just outta stay away from bait.  The weather here is depressing - gray, gray, gray and cold. Not very cheery easter weather at all. Nonetheless, to all of you, Happy Easter!

      Lolol. Dante, what would you do with a bit of jet lag if this one hour is killing you this much?  Things are quiet here. The weather is very unreliable (one minute snow showers, the next, sparkling sunshine) so I have not been outdoors much.  Have been painting, am not satisfied yet with a lot of my picture but will persevere. And by the way Jen, those brushes are absolutely awesome! They are very long, thus extremely comfortable to handle and don't "fuzz" or lose hairs the way that cheap brushes do!  Hey, am wearing jeans today! Yipppppeeee! That swelling in the belly has gone down a bit at last! Finally, other clothes!

       Kaputt   Am completely exhausted today (still) and my stomach hurts. I assume this is from all the prodding that the doctor did yesterday. Spent all morning with my couch.  Had to hem up those pants I bought yesterday, almost three inches. I am not actually small but I bought the pants in the men's department and I guess men are a bit taller. Actually, I think they are skater pants, but they are comfortable, so I do not care. All that hemming yesterday (unusual for me to be that diligent with sewing) got me to repair the hole in my winter coat (a button tore off, leaving a large hole). I brought it directly to the dry cleaner across the street then, hoping not to need it again for a few months. Our weather the next few days is rain and snow, but since I am going nowhere I won't need the coat.  Here is a wonderful link Jen sent me, try it - it's a challenge and it's fun (and let me know how you did ;-)).  urlLink  click here

      As if being poked, prodded and penetrated ain't bad enough. Nonetheless, the Dr. is pleased with my process.  Finally finished at the doctor's, I left the building to call my father on the cell phone to pick me up (we made a family outing out of this morning - they shopped while I dropped, lol).   My cell phone would not let me call anyone.  Would not let me send an SMS either.  Assumably because my bank refused to let them deduct their last bill.  So there I was. Found no phone booths. Walked to the nearest post office - usually there are some there.  No phone booth. It rained. I didn't have an umbrella. The guy at the post office said, 150 feet further down the street there is a phone booth. There was.  It did not accept coins. AARRRRRGGGGHHHH.  The lady at the reception of the county clerk's office was kind enough to phone U. for me.  After managing to reunite the family, we did some shopping - I needed some pants I can get into and got two inexpensive pair with elastic waists. How fashionable. Lol. Don't care. Considering I have worn neither bra nor make-up in four weeks I don't care.  U. invited us to lunch at BURGER KING - hmmmmmm, Whopper. Peak of the day, thus far. Going to lie down now, am exhausted.

      I have been bad about not posting, I know. It's just that there is nothing much new here and my life is not that exciting at the moment.  I spend a lot of time doing "quiet" stuff; reading, TV, hanging out on the couch, drinking Roibush Tea. Can't do more than that actually. Bit more every day, but taking it easy. We'll see what the doc says tomorrow.  Cut my hair. Yup. About 7 inches shorter (yes, wow). It is just past shoulder length now and I love it. I had too much hair - didn't know where to put it all. And, I was always just wearing it up and that gets boring after a while.  Looks kinda sassy now, actually ;-)  Regarding my next item, it's all Jenny's fault (but in a very GOOD kinda way). She sent me a huge set of some very wonderful, high quality brushes for my birthday. They are very pretty, bound in a canvas pouch.  Ok, Jen. So, I now have an easel standing upstairs, have some canvasses, have some paint (oil and acrylic) and am doing some painting. Am not sure I even can paint but she always tells me I can do stuff like that. Why not try. Anyhow, it is fun and it is RELAXING. Am not looking to become Van Gogh (like my ears too much), just want to paint a few nice pictures. Heck, I'd be happy just being Bob Ross, LOLOLOL. Will let you know how this turns out; if I am happy with any of them, I will post them here.  I sowed the seeds mom sent me last week (they are all sprouting). Only took a week. Am looking forward to warm spring weather, wearing dresses (yes, still have a swelly belly - it looks like Beckham kicked a football down my throat). Starting to wonder if maybe they implanted something in the hospital - wouldn't this make a good horror novel - women going into the hospital for GYN surgery being used to raise some sort of weird aliens ......  Dante, take it from here.  There is a wonderful site that I found and want to share with anyone out there who is having to consider a hysterectomy or is post-op. It is a wealth of information, a forum consisting of women who are all in the same boat - it is a great source of information, a lot of experience is shared, and you know you aren't alone with all of those unpleasant and sometimes strange side effects. The site is called HysterSisters (www.hystersisters.com).  Oh, and do you know what I saw on TV today? (Stupid question, of course not).  Sky Surfing  - they jump out of airplanes with snowboards at 16.000 feet and surf through the air before parachuting on down - is this nuts or what? Or is it just a California thing?  Oh, and if anyone knows what the lottery numbers will be next week, just mail me, ok? Thanks.

       Wow!    urlLink Dante  has redone his site and it is looking good!  Did not want to get up this morning, we went fishing for eel last night. It is always the same, just never seem to get home before 11:30 or midnight. Then, I am usually up quite late.  There wasn't much going on at the lake, the folks next to us caught a nice tench, I caught a nice eel but that was it.  Spent this afternoon lying in the sun (yes, in my new bikini) reading the latest Mankell novel; the first crime novel AFTER the Wallander series. Good reading, though I kinda miss Wallander.  Uwe is smoking these for us for dinner:    Yum.  Yes, I know they look gross but they taste just exquisitely!

       Is it me or what.....   Why do such chaotic things always happen to me?   Yesterday started out real well, actually. Went grocery shopping very early. Straightened up the house a bit, simultaneously connected the scanner my father gave me and scanned some documents that I needed copies of.   At 11:00 I decided to leave the house briefly, going by the recycling place, then to the ATM at the post office to get money and then to the town officials to get a small detail taken care of.  The recycling place was empty. I went through the gate with my old glass bottles, wanting to throw them in the container, when all of a sudden, a man started shouting, "we're closed". I was astonished, having thought Thursdays from 10-12 they were opened. Plus the gate was open.  He got out of the truck and again explained, they weren't open, showed me the signs with the opening times. I set to go back to the car and then, after brief negotiations with the man (who was very nice actually) quickly got rid of the old bottles.  At the community center, I was astonished. There were no more parking spaces. In fact, there were cars everywhere. The only free space was for handicapped. I decided to park there shortly, knowing I would not be long.  Turned out, the woman I needed to see was not available because she was carrying out a marriage. Her coworker could not help me because she did not know the password for getting into the computer. I decided to come back Tuesday.  Got to the parking lot. Twas fuller than when I left - there were cars parked behind me. After waiting 15 minutes and getting somewhat nervous (about the parking ticket police and about the fact that I should have been cooking chicken soup for lunch and by this time it was noon) I decided to go back in. Turned out it was the car of the newlyweds that was blocking me. I waited in the hall until the ceremony was over, then got the best man to move the car, thus allowing me to dash home and cook chicken soup in 45 minutes (which worked in the pressure cooker).  Funny thing, living in a small town. During this entire experience, I bumped into my ex-boss (from 8 1/2 years ago), the woman who was my roommate in the hospital, and Hilde's aunt and her cousin.

       Gray in, gray out....   It has been an uneventful day in many ways, gray and ordinary as is the weather.   urlLink Dante  has rediscovered his muse and is now posting; however, I did not find any links to a deli. However, I must say, that Bedtymbabi is georgous - so why isn't she your girlfriend (he's blushing as he reads this and probably gonna wanna kill me).  ;-) Love you, little bro!  Oh, and send me a higher resolution of that photo of you at work - couldn't make out any details of you and Mom said you were looking real good lately!

       Feeling better.....   Monday was just a crappy day was all. By evening, I had decided to let the world KMA, (für meine deutschen Leser mich am A... l... zu lassen).  That made me feel better.  I did spend the last two afternoons outside in my bikini in a wind protected area of the garden and actually managed to get a slight sunburn. I read the last novel in the Wallander series by Mankell (Wallander's erster Fall) "Wallander's First Case". It was wonderful. Very well done. Praise.  This morning, after wondering why my finger nails were so clean and white, I decided to weed out the rose beds. Now they aren't white anymore, but the roses look lovely. There were lots of poppy plants - apparently, the big one in the garden spread its seeds last year.  Tobi has overnight company - his old girlfriend "Hexe" is staying the night as her owner is having to have some sort of endoscopic examination done and is staying overnight at the hospital.  Tomorrow, Uwe has his first in the new chemo series - I am thankful that he appears to be in good medical hands.   I will be donating four hours at the office as they need me to do something or another.  Oh, and I got an invite from the employment office. Next Wednesday and Thursday, 8 - 12:30. A Seminar on how to write resumes and that kinda stuff. Like I don't know how.  It's mandatory. If you don't appear, they cap your pay for two weeks. So, I will go and learn how to write resumes. Ce la vie.   Non scholae, set vitae discimus.

       52 Degrees F and Fair.....   Yes. Aren't we almost at the end of May? And they are saying on the radio that we may have frost tonight!!!!  I know, I sometimes seem to be obsessed with the weather, but that is for no other reason that I am an absolute outdoor person. In the warm months, I practically live outside (garden or porch) and go in only to sleep or such. It kills me when it is so cold that you have to wear a thick sweater end of May. It is too cold to go fishing (yes, it is, because there is wind to consider and if your fingers are frozen after five minutes, it ain't any fun).   I know it has been a bad weather month cause I just checked my internet access bill, and I am way over my monthly hours this time. Probably has something to do with playing  urlLink Bookworm . This is a very fun word game but highly addictive. Uwe hasn't left his computer in days, I think.  Anyhow, if you try it, let me know how you like it. My Highscore is 522000 (german version). See, I just started playing again, even though I only went there to get the english version link for this post (it is weird playing it in english - when I play it in german, I see a lot of english words I could make).  Been wondering what's up with  urlLink  Dante  - not much news from him these days. Or perhaps he is just going through an uninspired phase - I know those phases, believe me.  (By the way, my Bookworm score at the moment is at 301980 (english version). :-P  Actually, I am also printing my organizer pages for the next two weeks (not just screwing around doing stupid stuff). Need to get my butt in gear and actually do have along list of errands and such to take care of. My tax return (and the paper piles associated with it) are also looming on the horizon. Am hoping also to perhaps have some job interviews in the next weeks, though the market seems to be kind of resting at the moment. Unemployment looms.

       The Ironie of it All....   So you pack special gear (strong reels with special fishing line), stiff and resilient rods, pack your butt into a boat and sit out until 10 in the evening, freezing your bunions off. And, you catch nothing. You go out for european catfish and just come home empty handed.  That was on Monday night.  This morning, we headed up to the lake at 5.30. We were hoping to catch some tench or carp or whatever, or just enjoy the wonderful sunshine and warm temperatures. At 7.30, my swimmer gently went under, the line was being pulled nicely and I thought, well, small carp. It was kind of a strange drill; at some point I realized the fish wasn't acting like a carp and was certainly too big to be a tench. Imagine my suprise:     90 cm long, 10 lbs. in weight. Wow. I drilled him in with my  match rod  (for those non-fishers out there, a very long and thin rod, designed for smaller fish such as trout). Wheeeewwww.  Have a look at the size of this guy's mouth:     And last but not least, a big thanks to Uwe for scooping him into the net :-)).  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!

       Sunshine!   Which inspired me to go to the nursery to buy "a couple of begonias". Lol. Yeah. Me in a nursery and getting a "couple" of flowers. They oughtnt let me near one.  Bought seven begonias, two petunias, four melons, one rosemarie, one coriander, basil and two big sacks of potting soil.  The weather was so nice this morning that after the shopping spree I went for a walk with Tobi (well, I just couldn't drive past his favorite river without stopping now, could I?).  It was wonderful. The dandelions are in full bloom, the air is fresh, and everything was just georgous. Here two pictures (phone quality):        Am off now to fishing (from the boat this time). Uwe has got his sights set on one of those European Catfish. Wish me luck ;-))

       It's Rainin' Again   I think it's time we petition the Bavarian Government to change its state anthem to the Supertramp tune; it is certainly more accurate than    "God with you, oh land of bavarians, german soil, fatherland! Above your wide areas your blessed hand shall rest! Shall he (the lord) protect your fields, shield your citie's walls and conserve to you the colours of his skies, white and blue!"   If you want to hear the melody, here a link (from UCLA, lol):   urlLink Bavaria   The skies have been gray almost continuously since April.  Oh well. Seeing as the weather was awful, I treated myself to my first bath since surgery, hmmmm. Twas good.  But what is really bugging me, is these UFO reports out of Mexico. Have you folks seen the video from the Mexican news?  urlLink  Here a link to the video   Here a link to the press articles about it (google).  urlLink  Google News Search    I mean, I liked the movie "Signs", thought it was excellent actually. But viewing this video is like what Mel Gibson's brother was seeing on TV while he was watching TV in the closet.  I thought it was scary. Some scientists are saying those are gases. But how come gases can move so regularly and obviously in group formation? No, I am not a hysterical, esoteric whacko. Never have been. But have a look at the video and let me know what you think.  Have to go check my battery flashlights and secure the basement windows.... ;-)  But before I do that, here another link. I'm Franklin!

        Mild and partly cloudy...    Gosh, been a busy day even though only half over.  Got the garden hose hooked up (been in the basement for the winter) and finally cleaned Kuni's aviary with the high pressure cleaner. Then, it was off to the pharmacy to get a prescription for the cat filled (Pauli has been vomiting a lot, we de-wormed her on Sunday but it hasn't stopped). The vet took blood for the lab and also discovered an infection in her upper jaw which we are now treating with medication. The rest of the blood results aren't available until Tuesday, but the ones I got back today were good. The Vet said that for an 11-year old cat, her organs are in really great shape. However, the acidocyte leukocytes are at 15% and should be at 4%, indicating perhaps an extreme allergic reaction, which could also be a reaction to parasites. (Yes, recently she started to eat the mice she catches).  Went grocery shopping, washed and hung out to dry all of my laundry, repotted my Azalea. Lunch was Rib-eyes and baked potatoes and yummy.  Am going to head for a small nap (got up at 6:30 for no reason but that I was awake). This afternoon and evening, we are going Fishing!!!!! Finally once again. Perhaps I might even catch something, will see.

        Poor dog.    Not a pretty sight that was. The vet had to remove the broken off piece of Tobi's claw. She tried twice, even with both of us holding him he kept squealing and pulling away. So, the vet gave him anasthesia and took care of it that way. All in all, we lifted him on and off the table twice. Phew. He took a while to come out of the anesthesia so she took care of some other stuff (scratch wound on his back, etc.). Then, she gave him a shot for the pain. Poor guy. When he woke up and we went back to the car, he had a gaunt like Bambi on the ice - all four legs kept going in different directions. He slept through the evening and the night, and is now (almost 6 o'clock) outside for the first time today, though limping terribly.  The vet bandaged the paw quite nicely, and put a red sock over his foot to protect the bandage.  He looks kinda silly, but cute. Poor guy.

        News...    Blog news -  I have added a commenting feature, meaning, anyone reading this blog can (and should if they want to) add a comment.   Try it, that way I will at least know if it works or not - just click on the word "comment" underneath the post and say what is on your mind!  Please note that you  do not  have to fill out the "email" and "url" part.  If you just want to read what others have commented, click on the number behind the comment (if it is >0). Lol. Remembering elementary school.  What a lazy Saturday it has been - have not been able to convince my lazy self to do anything constructive today (with the exception of having planted all of my geraniums for the window boxes, planted my cayenne and jalapeno and salvia in larger pots). Had planned on fishing but it was so cold and windy I decided not to.  Oh, yes, I vacuumed.  It is soooo cold here. And windy. 54F, much too cold for this time of the year. Anyhow, gave me an excuse to stay inside most of the day and do nothing. I surfed some, read news, played a word game which drives me nuts.  This evening we are taking Tobi to the vet; he split a claw today and seems to be in a lot of pain. The vet told me on the phone I needed to cut off the piece sticking away, but there is no way I can do that myself. I know it must hurt like hell and I ain't doing it. So, the nice lady vet will meet us at the clinic at eight. Didn't want him to have pain through the night.  Saw a funny ass movie last night - don't know the english title but its with Jack Nickolson as a shrink and some poor guy who is really nice but keeps getting into situations where he gets aggressive (attacking flight personnel, busting a waitresses nose). Anyhow, this guy is then forced into treatment with JN, who is a really screwed up shrink.  Laughed like hell.   Might watch About Schmidt tonight or tomorrow, am looking forward to it. Anyone out there seen it?

        Tench!    Finally broke that non-catching streak today. No trout (no one else caught any either) but see here - two very nice tench!     I am not sure if they are native to the U.S., so if you haven't ever seen one, here is a somewhat clearer drawing (my phone doesn't take the best pictures).    Here some facts about this species from the friendly folks at the Environmental Agency, UK.  Species – Tench, Tinca tinca (L.) Weight – rarely 4.5kg (10lb), very few over 5.5kg (12lb) Length – rarely exceed 60cm Age – maximum 14 years Location – lakes, canals and lowland rivers Behaviour – mostly solitary, occasionally in small groups Preferred habitat – shallow still water, dense weed, silt substrate Feeding – May-September, active benthic foraging at dawn and dusk Natural food – zooplankton, benthic invertebrates such as molluscs  Guess what I'm having for dinner?

        Unemployed......    Well, yes. As of June 1 I am joining the ranks of the unemployed (unless I find a job until then but I don't think it will go that fast). Went to the unemployment office on Thursday to take care of the formalities. Gosh, that is a dreadful kind of place. Why do they always leave the walls white, use cheap and ugly linoleum for the floors - and why do the chairs and tables always look the same as in every goverment location? I had to wait about 20 minutes to see the person responsible for my case, so I had lots of time to think about stuff while I was sitting there. I mean, they do seem to make efforts, there are signs about discretion and those kind of things, but why don't they just make these darn offices a bit cheerier? Everyone going in there has dread in their heart and worry on their brow. How about a couple of sunflowers on the walls or something like that? Was that a ramble or what? Lol.

      Corvus Monedula  The animal clinic referred us to a very nice man who rescued a young jackdaw who had apparently fallen out of the nest. The man has been taking care of him for about 10 days but is unable to continue to do so. Thus, we have a young guest - about four weeks old, when he is grown, this is what he will look like:     Maybe I can post a picture of him tomorrow.  Spent the day gathering the rest of the paperwork I need for my appointment tomorrow and putting my life story on paper for the immigration authorities. The man I made the appointment with was very nice on the phone; hope I have all documentation I need, but I think I am covered. Even found my last report card from high school in Munich - amongst lots of other old things, letters, notes, bunch of stuff. Was a real trip down memory lane this morning!

       What is it about   shoes by the side of the road? How do they get there?   Yesterday, when I drove to FFB to visit Friedl and her new hip there was a shoe lying by the side of the highway. I am sure that you have seen this sort of thing yourself. It always gives me kind of a queesy feeling - I always imagine, I guess, someone being knocked out of their shoes by a speeding car - but that cannot be.   Anyhow, Friedl is doing fine with her new hip - she is literally beaming about being able to move her right leg again. They haven't allowed her to get out of bed, she is a bit upset about that but is quite her old self - happy and pain free.  The correspondence school at which I did some PC courses a few years back sent me some new study offers. I can imagine that being a Feng Shui Consultant might be quite satisfying - or how about Capital Accumulation or Practical Psychology....  But seriously, I am toying with the idea of continuing on as a certified translator. However, the course for this has a length of 24 months with 2 hours of study daily - will have to consider this seriously.   Aughh... am rambling here. :-)

       Summer!   Well, Uwe wasn't quite feeling up to it so we did not go fishing this morning. Instead, I made the most of this heavenly summer weather of 75 F - not a cloud in the sky - no wind - kinda day.  Did my shopping this morning. Then, repotted my cayenne and jalapenos, fertilized everything including the tomatoes and roses.   I spent the entire afternoon lying on my chaise lounge in the sun, just soaking up every ray.  Which means I didn't get around to my indoor chores, but I am sure that I will get to that during the next rainy day, coming soon.  France is out of the EM. Amazing. Greece is in the semi-finals. All the previous big favorites - Germany, Italy, England, now France (world-champion actually) are out. Will be interesting to see what happens with Holland/Sweden this evening as Holland as always been a big favorite too.  I made a "wurst salat" for dinner. There is perhaps something strange about making bavarian wurst salat with italian balsamico vinegar, but oddly enough, it tastes wonderful!

       Exhausted   Drove 200 km today, through sleet, rain, snow and hail. Spent a good deal of time actually standing on the autobahn. Me and a couple of thousand other cars.   I drove to the  urlLink "Holledau"  today to meet with someone who has done some translation work for me. The "Holledau", translated from the Bavarian meaning Hops Valley lies north of Munich about halfway between Munich and Regensburg. 95% of the world's supply of Hops comes from this region, as you see on the picture, the hops is "trained" to grow upwards by cords attached to   urlLink poles . Driving through this area all you see is poles and hops as far as the eye can see. It is very picturesque. Hops is a beautiful plant with wonderful  urlLink blossoms  which are often made into wreaths in Bavaria.  On my way back, I drove right by FFB, which is where Tante Friedl received her new hip this morning - and that at 88 years of age. I wasn't sure if they would let me visit her because she is still in the ICU, but they did. She is doing well, is a bit chatty and seems to have put the worst behind her. Three Cheers for Her!  Also on my way home was the cemetery where my grandmother is buried; thus, I made a stop there as well. Gisi and Moni planted some nice red ice begonias on her grave.  As you can imagine, watering them was not necessary.  I am NOT going to watch soccer tonight. It is just too nerve racking. The game yesterday (England/Portugal) went into two overtimes yesterday followed by penalty shoot-outs which England lost, 5 - 6.  The portugese celebrated all night, the english blamed the referee for not allowing a goal because the goal keeper was attacked. Anyhow, I did not see the rest of the game - I went to bed at the end of regular playing time, telling my folks to please turn off the lights before going home.  No football tonight, tomorrow at 5, am going fishing.

       I have been desperately searching for   my stomach muscles. Since the operation in March, I still feel like I no longer have any. In the morning, when I go for a long walk with Tobi, I try to keep them really tucked in for the entire 45 minutes, hoping that this will firm them up a bit. However, doing this doesn't feel like I am contracting ANY kind of muscle - I am wonderering, where they have gone.  So, I bought these at ebay:     1/2 kG for each arm, 1.5 kG for each leg (that's about one pound and three pounds).  Yesterday, I put them on (even though I should have spared my left knee - I seem to have overstretched the ligaments on it somehow and it hurts like hell actually) and did some light arobic exercises.   Made me realize that some of my other muscles are out of shape as well. And, at some point, after doing a variation of situps, I managed to bang the heck out of the inside of my ankle on the corner of the coffee table, thus getting one heck of a bruise.  Today, my stomach is swollen and itching and numb.  On another front, hope no one watched the Germany/Czech Republic game yesterday. They played miserably. It was embarrassing to watch. Especially in light of the fact that the Czechs had their bench playing. Germany is out of the match of course, but I feel that is deserved. They played like a Dorfmannschaft (Village Team) though I am sure that this might be an insult to some village teams.  Nonetheless, may the best team win!

       Just Had to Post This.....   While sorting through my endless piles of paper and getting them into some sort of logical order, I stumbled upon this (click on the photo for a larger image):   urlLink     This is me at about age 4 and my cousin Sylvia at about age 2. We were standing in front of my grandmother's house. The skirt I am wearing was one of my favorites - it was green plaid. Notice the wonderful daisies behind us - my grandmother loved daisies and boy, did we love HER!

       City Folk and Country Living.....   I don't know why I thought about this today, but here goes. Those who know me also know that though I spent the first 6 years of my life living rurally (10 km from here), the rest of my life was spent in town and city living.  So I guess it was no surprise that, a few years back in Chicago, on a wonderful spring day in early May, I drove to the farmer's market (I think on Waukegan Road a few miles north of Deerfield). Well, I was expecting to buy wonderful produce - ripe red tomatoes, green and juicy cucumbers, a few ears of corn, that kinda stuff. Imagine my suprise when I got there and there was no one there selling anything.   Yes, I really was surprised. Well, it was spring, wasn't it? Shouldn't there have been lots of harvest? Looking back, I find it hard to believe I was that dumb.  Something similar happened to me upon my return to Germany. There is a walnut tree in the garden. In the fall, there were these big green things hanging on it and I (not even knowing what kind of tree it was) asked what they were. Walnuts, my father said. Huh? I said "well, in the states, walnuts are brown, so what kind of walnuts are those?"  I think my father laughed until he cried. Then he showed me the brown nut inside the green, soft shell.

          Exhausted....   From Soccer. Watched both games yesterday, Germany - Latvia (0/0) and Holland - Czech Republic (2/3). Wow.  Here the current standings of all competing teams:   urlLink      Tonight I will be watching Spain vs. Portugal (one game per evening is quite enough, I think).  And guess what. I remembered Father's Day this year - even made him a card myself AND remembered to call. Just goes to show there is always room to improve with just a bit of effort  ;-)

       Venus      This is a (if I remember correctly) topographically coded picture of Venus which I dug up somewhere last week. I am not sure if it was visible in the states, but last week Venus crossed in front of the Sun which has not happened for 120 years. It was not exactly spectacular, especially when compared with the total eclipse of the sun we had a few years ago, but something special nonetheless.  Dante seems to have been pretty badly under the weather, get well soon, drink lots of liquids and get mom to make you some chicken soup. It helps. If mom can't, make some yourself, it is easy and GOOD. I posted the recipe on January 11. Hugs to you.  I am not going to say a thing about the weather. That's it. Nothing. I have decided to deal with it by pretending to be living in northern Sweden. Yup.

       Ain't that a beauty...     Congrats to Uwe. 16 pounds!!!  Had my appointment at the unemployment office yesterday; the man responsible for my "case" is very nice and was very helpful. Afterward, after driving through the cobblestone streets of  urlLink Landsberg  which I think loosened not only a few of my teeth but perhaps every screw in my little  urlLink Renault Twingo  I noticed my stomach was growling so I decided to make a quick stop at McDonald's. Directly across the street there is a Burger King, but from a traffic standpoint, McDonald's is easier to get in and out of.  Because of the Euro 2004 Soccer Championship, they currently have  urlLink Kickmacs  (notice the bun looks like a football). Anyhow, I had one and it was wonderful. Hmmm.   It is raining here once again, so I am spending the day honing my resume and getting a bunch of them sent out; wish me luck!

       Wow, what a game .....(England / France)      SF Chronicle writes "Injury time was already under way and 30,000 English fans were dreaming of celebrating a Euro 2004 victory over defending champion France.   Then Zinedine Zidane took over.   Zidane, one of the world's best soccer players, curled a free kick past goalkeeper David James to tie it. A minute later, Zidane drove home a penalty kick, after James upended Thierry Henry, to give France a stunning 2-1 victory."  Hope you saw it, or at least get to see those two fantastic goals. Wow.

       I am such a Moron sometimes...   I sent off my resume per email yesterday after having discovered an interesting job which sounds just up my alley.  My ever oh-so reliable browser (Opera) - which is usually 110% reliable, crashed four times while I was trying to send the email with attachments. Frustrating. Still no excuse.  After finally having been able to get the email on its way, I discovered a typo in the FIRST line of the text. AAAAARRRGGGHHH. Not in the last line, or later on in the text where no one might have noticed it, no. First line of text. Bravo. Way to go. Now I can only hope it isn't noticed by the person reading it.  We are having the most wonderful weather, cloudy with rain threatening to appear, a lovely 55 F. I keep asking myself if it really is mid-June or have I just got the wrong calendar pages?  Just have to make the best of it. Knit socks maybe?

       And other lessons learned....   When I stumbled into the kitchen this morning at 6:30 a.m. desperately seeking coffee, I was surprised and grossed out by the fact that there was a night crawler slithering around my kitchen floor.  I was awake fast.   This night crawler could only have come from the styrofoam crawler box in the refrigerator. But if he was on the floor instead of in the box where he belonged - eeeeeekkkkk.  I opened the refrigerator and noticed there was about a 1/4 inch gap between the box and the lid. Got home late from fishing (about 11.00) and hurriedly got everything stashed away.   There were two in the vegetable compartment, six of them cozying up underneath the door seal and one way in the back.  After having disinfected my refrigerator and its entire contents, I will be insisting that my father keep the bait in HIS refrigerator. That way, when they escape, I won't have to deal with it.  It rained in buckets yesterday and today, so I spent the day cleaning the house. Caught a bunch of sleep this afternoon - the meds my orthopedic gave me kinda make my muscles rubbery. It's an infection of the muscles around the spine on the neck; he prescribed me Diclofenac and Mydocalm, which is a muscle relaxant. Should help.  He told me to buy nordic walking sticks. Can you believe that? We have been making fun of all those people walking around everywhere with these things because it just looks soooo ridiculous. However, the doc insists that, aside from cross-country, it is the only workout that corrects these kind of conditions, caused by sitting at the pc, reading too much, wrong posture.  I will have to think about this.  Hmph.

       Happy Birthday!     Tante Friedl celebrated her 88th birthday today! God bless her.  Thank you Gisi for the most excellent strawberry cake to mark the occasion. :-)  As for me, as you can see, I have not been kidnapped by aliens or run over by a truck. There just has been very little to say and very little to tell. Life is being kinda up and down at the moment; I have not found my personal rhythm in this world of being unemployed and feel somewhat adrift.   I buy a bunch of newspapers on the weekend, hoping to send some resumes out. There is very little in the papers at the moment, I think the summer pause is starting.  When I do something not related to finding a job, I get a bad conscience, thus not really enjoying what I am doing. Yeah, I tend to beat myself up quite a bit, always setting those standards kinda high.  Dante, just a quick tip - one of the most excellent wines I have had in the last years is a Merlot out of California called Cooper's Lane - it is extremely difficult to get here, perhaps you can find it and give it a try. It is very smooth, dry as dust but with a wonderfully soft bouquet - hmmmmmmm.

       This one's a hoot....strange fiction   Jen complained about the story from yesterday only being in German. Not really in the mood to translate, I ran it through one of those internet translation pages.  Here, the text:   How can one baptize that at all a child, a baby, Ute? What did my parents imagine thereby? Taken in the reason is it no bad names, but the connection of the name with the appearance of an infant falls me today still heavily. A second name to which I, gave it could perhaps have changed over to me unfortunately not. My parents behaved even with designating your child briefly and concisely.  I buildup nevertheless with the feeling to be loved. Nut/mother was a good-natured however tormented creature. She suffered for many years from the continuous unfaithfulness of my father; the however in the actual sense probably nothing for it could. He loved my nut/mother in each regard, noticed I at that time already, only, he was expressed well one, which simply resist could not if the opportunity arose.   I still remember the wedding of its sister Jutta, which married an Italian for bright frightening of its family. Antonio was the son of an owner of restaurant in our neighbourhood and spoke flowing German. Its appearance corresponded that of a Mafioso, because it did not have a slope to the criminality, but because of its extreme vanity. Antonio carried only the best suits and examined its appearance at each opportunity.  The wedding celebration was very complex, I believes in such a way around the 250 guests. Everything was very complex decorated, it gave plentifully to meals and drinking, it was talked, laughed danced. A bomb tendency actually. Then got my nut/mother mean father in flagranti with Antonios cousin in a laundry area of the hotel.

       Live and learn....   Well, I put that two-day seminar from the employment office behind me and I must say, it was actually quite interesting. Most of the material was familiar, I think, to most people but the woman who moderated the seminar had quite a few interesting additions and I was pleasantly surprised.  It was actually kind of interesting being in a classroom full of other people who are also unemployed. It was an interesting mix - everything from cooks to hairdressers to a physicist to a building engineer. Most of the people there were also approximately my age. Perhaps I have a dangerous age at the moment, job-wise. Don't know.   However one lady, an IT-Specialist, said she was really shocked that the unemployment office told her to take it easy and slow, her being 46 made her second priority for them anyhow. Wow. If you are 45 or older, you are second priority. Younger people first - I actually thing it ought to be the other way around. Younger people are more flexible, easier to place, usually single and without family to support.  Whatever.  Here, a treat for my German-language readers. It is a story I started to write a while back, let me know if I should continue with it.   Wie kann man den überhaupt ein Kind, ja ein Säugling, „Ute“ taufen? Was sich meine Eltern dabei nur dachten. Im Grunde genommen ist es ja kein schlechter Namen, aber die Verbindung des Namens mit dem Erscheinungsbild eines Kleinkinds fällt mir heute noch schwer. Einen Mittelnamen auf den ich vielleicht hätte ausweichen können, gaben Sie mir leider nicht. Meine Eltern verhielten sich sogar bei dem Benennen Ihres Kindes kurz und bündig.  Nichts desto trotz wuchs ich auf mit dem Gefühl, geliebt zu sein. Meine Mutter war ein gütiges aber gequältes Geschöpf. Sie litt jahrelang unter der andauernde Untreue meines Vaters; der aber im eigentlichen Sinne wahrscheinlich nichts dafür konnte. Er liebte meine Mutter in jeder Hinsicht, das merkte ich damals schon, nur, er war ein ausgesprochen gutaussehender Man, der einfach nicht widerstehen konnte wenn sich die Gelegenheit ergab.   Ich erinnere mich noch an die Hochzeit seiner Schwester Jutta, die zum blanken Entsetzen Ihrer Familie einen Italiener heiratete. Antonio war der Sohn eines Restaurantbesitzers in unserer Nachbarschaft und sprach fließend deutsch. Sein Auftreten entsprach damals das eines Mafioso, nicht weil er einen Hang zur Kriminalität hatte, sondern wegen seiner extremen Eitelkeit. Antonio trug nur die besten Anzüge und inspizierte sein Erscheinungsbild bei jeder Gelegenheit.  Die Hochzeitsfeier war sehr aufwendig, ich glaube so um die 250 Gäste. Alles war sehr aufwendig dekoriert, es gab reichlich zu Essen und Trinken, es wurde geredet, getanzt gelacht. Eine Bombenstimmung eigentlich. Bis meine Mutter meinen Vater in flagranti mit Antonio’s Kusine in einem Wäscheraum des Hotels erwischte.

       Rearranging the furniture    is an excellent way to get exercise. It's also a good way to procrastinate doing your tax return.   Spent the entire day yesterday shoving furniture around and have now discovered a few muscles that I thought had gone away forever.   Looking back, I have always liked rearranging furniture now and then. I remember in Chicago, we had a "Schrank" - a big wall closet with showcase compartments that are standard in most german living rooms - these things usually measure big enough to cover up an entire wall. Anyhow, in Chicago this huge thing took up an entire living room wall and worse yet, completely covered one of the windows. One day, I decided enough of that and with help of my friend Lynda, we dismantled that sucker in its three parts. We left one part standing in the living room, lugged the other downstairs into the den, and I think the third one we got upstairs in the guest bedroom. Lol. When my husband got home from work he just gasped.   So, yesterday I rearranged here in the living room. It is also a wonderful way to clean things and areas you usually don't get to. A little tip from me - if you need to move a heavy piece of furniture, get four old socks to put under the corners. It eases pushing the piece across the floor while also avoiding or minimizing scratches. If you are having to push over carpeting, well, that's another story.   On another note, here a couple of things that are now in bloom in my garden:      Bloodwort I planted a few years ago.      My phlox in full bloom.      I have no idea what this thing is called in english, and neither does  urlLink Leo . It was given to me by an aquaintance a few years back, and has never been as HUGE as this year - it has got to be more than three feet high!      I didn't plant these - this hollyhock presumably made it's own way in there. I had planted some a few years back - they must have sowed out themselves.      Aren't these lovely?   Oh - and in the happy things department. My sincere apologies to all postal employees. The birthday card arrived! Yippee!!!! I had sent him a birthday card with the complete Euro Coins minted in Luxembourg - he got them! Yeah!

       Sad and Hurting    Most of you know that  urlLink Pauli &nbsp;has had a number of health problems in the last few months - she stopped eating because of a hairball problem, followed by a massive infection of the jawbone. Two weeks ago, the vet removed most of her teeth, she recovered for a few days and started eating again only to stop again because of a large abscess on her throat. Despite almost daily visits to the vet and numerous attempts to get her back on her feet, we seem to have failed.   We have not seen her since Sunday morning. She seems to have withdrawn to some quiet place - we have looked for her everywhere but to no avail. Cats tend to withdraw and hide when they pass and since she has never stayed away an entire night and stays away from streets, we are assuming the worst and have informed the vet accordingly.   She was 11 - goodbye my sweet.   &nbsp;

       Potpourri    First, a rant. I mailed Mom's and Gene's birthday cards in plenty of time on the same day (they were both cards I made myself). Mom got her card on Wednesday, Gene's has not arrived. This is bugging me to no end - I bought a small little something at the beginning of the year and saved it up for his birthday. If it doesn't get there, I am really going to pitch a fit. Really. Damn!  And if I get my hands on that sonofabitch who kept the card.........   aarrrrgggghhh. It was really something special just for him :-(((   Not much news here, nothing out of the ordinary happening (which is usually positive - out of the ordinary happenings can be quite disastrous, actually). I am spending quite a bit of time at home (with gas being at $5.45 a gallon, I am not driving anywhere not absolutely necessary). Worse than that - a pack of cigarettes costs $4.35 now. Yeah, time to quit probably.   I spent part of the day yesterday reading the first 100 pages of the  urlLink 9/11 Commission's Report , which I can only recommend as it is certainly interesting reading. Over 500 pages, it can be downloaded at the above link in Acrobat Format.   Let myself get talked into going fishing late afternoon yesterday - I didn't want to because some nasty thunderstorms were headed in. They, however, drifted off. The fish weren't biting, but it was nice anyhow. I hate thunderstorms when fishing - was out on the Ammersee late evening in a boat once, when three surrounding storms suddenly merged over the lake - I never, ever, ever want to experience something like that again. And fishing poles being such awesome lightning rods.....   I spent all of today cleaning. Really cleaning. You know, the "I think I need to dust the lightbulbs" kind of cleaning. Am exhausted but the house is looking great :-)   There was a very interesting article in the  urlLink Stern Magazine  regarding the single women (these are not necessarily young single women who have never been married, it seems more like my generation and age, women married once or twice). The article was informative:    "Als Hauptvorteil sehen die meisten Single-Frauen (81 Prozent) an, dass sie tun und lassen können, was sie wollen. 69 Prozent von ihnen genießen es, mehr Zeit für sich zu haben, und 56 Prozent, dass sie das Urlaubsziel selbst bestimmen können. 48 Prozent finden gut, dass es niemanden gibt, der die Wohnung unordentlich macht. Gut ein Drittel (36 Prozent) der Single-Frauen genießt es, dass sie sich keine Sportübertragungen im Fernsehen ansehen müssen. Nur zwei Prozent der Frauen, die ohne Partner leben, genießen ihr Single-Dasein nicht."     &nbsp;   "Perceived as the main advantage by 81 percent is being able to to what they want. 69 percent of them enjoy having more time for themselves, and 56 percent&nbsp;liked being able to choose their vacation destination on their own. 48 percent like the fact that no one is there to mess up the apartment. One third (36 percent) enjoyed not having to&nbsp;watch sport shows on television".    I can only agree with the above.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Thanks for the feedback on the resume photos, I am back on the drawing board on this one as I agree with all of you - those pics don't really look like me.  By the way the churchbells are  urlLink ringing , there seems to be another thunderstorm headed this way (in Bavaria, perhaps in all of Germany, not sure, they ring the churchbells when a storm is heading in - logic behind it being probably&nbsp;previously a religious one, today&nbsp;being the assumption that the&nbsp;sound waves created will get the air masses to move onward).  The quality of the bells recording is not so good - recorded it with my dictaphone and fed it into the PC over the microphone, but it will give you an idea of how noisy they can be. Gotta unplug my laptop.

       Wonderful, Wonderful Summer    Well, we have actually had five straight days of summer weather - looks like it is here at last.  Spent two hours down at the river with Tobi yesterday, it was hot and sticky weather. We crossed the river twice (I like getting him to swim - he needs to burn off some of&nbsp; those lazy dog calories). When we crossed back, I stripped and just plunged right on in - there were no other people there and even if there were, the cold water was just too good.   After we got back, there was a thunderstorm with such a cloud break that the LNB on the Satellite Dish wasn't getting enough signal for my DigiBox to receive any programs. Cooled off the temperatures a bit though, which was quite pleasant.   I think  urlLink Dante  is having trouble getting a modem connection up at the fishing lodge; or maybe he is just so busy catching lots of fish that he has no time to post ;-) Wish you the biggest pike ever, little bro! I think it's wonderful that he and Dad have taken the time to spend a week fishing.  There is a wonderful article by Mike Morford of the San Francisco Chronicle that I would like to link to  urlLink here ; I usually restrict my political activity to my other blog but this article is really worth a read.  I am still working on completing the  urlLink website , I added photos of Jen's trip to Frisco and commented some of the photo pages. Am still working on getting those recipes up there as well as a massive "fun" database of jokes for the jokes page. Send me all the blond jokes you can - I think I will start a collection. There are some really good ones out there; one of the best I have ever heard is the one with the  urlLink mailbox .  Movies I have recently seen:   urlLink The Magdalen Sisters : very good.  urlLink Unfaithful : very good, not for the faint of heart.  urlLink K-Pax : surprisingly quite ok.  Am just linking all over the place today, I know. :-)

       Resume Photos   &nbsp;  It is customary in Germany to include a photo on the resume itself.  &nbsp;  I have been somewhat dissatisfied with mine, as the background is too dark and resume photos, just like passport photos, are usually done on a neutral white background.  &nbsp;  Thus, after having failed at editing my current resume photo (it's the same one as you see to the right) I decided to do a new photo. This is no problem with a digicam, right?  &nbsp;  I did my hair, got dressed up properly (from the waist up only, no reason to take off my comfy garden shorts). Hung a white bedsheet on the bathroom door, converted my ceiling lamp to a tripod, directed all available lighting and took pictures.  &nbsp;  The more I took the worse it got. When I was taking the last batch, I wondered what smelled so burnt until I realized that when I leaned to look at the back of the camera to check if the positioning was ok, my hair was partially hanging in the halogen reading lamp which was also redirected to shine at the bathroom door.  &nbsp;  I think I was at number 35 (none of them were good - I felt like I looked awful, something was always wrong with them) when Uwe stuck his head in the door and asked what on earth I was up to and what happened to my hair - he said I looked like a tinsel angel. There I was, in my crisp white blouse and my elegant new wool jacket.....and my wrinkled old garden shorts, barefoot.  Imagine, he dared laugh.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So, he went to the basement and brought his projection screen out in the yard and shot about six pictures of me. I still wasn't completely happy with the result, but that is because this seems one of those "can't stand to look at myself" days.  &nbsp;  So, here is the worst one I took....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the best one he took......  &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Which one of those would you considere hiring? Surely not the one on the left, looking like she is about to get hit by a large flying object.........  &nbsp;  Aaaaaarrrrrrrgggggghhhhhh.

       What it is with the birds this year?  &nbsp; My niece Steffi&nbsp;woke me from my afternoon nap when she delivered a perhaps 1 week old sparrow which she and her other aunt had found down by the lake. Apparently, he had fallen out of the nest and his parents were no were in sight. So, here we go again. He is very lively and&nbsp;chirpy, hope this one makes it. &nbsp; Fishing was good; the weather was perfect, the people were fun, all in all a wonderful way to spend the first half of the day. I caught four tench which were all undersized, and Uwe caught a very small carp which he also put back in. No problem with that though, most people didn't catch a thing - the fish just weren't biting today. &nbsp; On another note, Jen has been asking me about movie recommendations as she has gotten some sort of super DVD Rental deal. Whenever I try to concentrate on making a list, I can't think of anything current. Thus, I will be posting movies now and then as I think of them or have seen them. &nbsp; These two I saw recently: &nbsp;  Far From Heaven , Julianne Moore, Dennis Quaid - plot was ok, the actors were good, however it was my impression that the details about the timeperiod (1958) were exagerated - there were moments when I thought I was watching Beaver and Wally.  &nbsp;  Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood  - Sandra Bullock and many more - wonderful. Lovely movie. Definitely worth seeing. &nbsp;

       Sadly, not all things   can end well, but I guess that's just a part of life.  The song thrush didn't make it. She died yesterday evening. Was sitting in her cage, sleeping. A bit later on I saw her sleeping on her stomach, when suddenly she started flapping her little wings - I knew that was no good. Held her in my hand, tried to give her some additional warmth to stabilize her by blowing warm air onto her, all to no avail. I buried her under the hedge.  I assume she had suffered some kind of internal injury, because when the vet checked her, he could find nothing broken. The swelling on the air sac, however, failed to go down and I assume it came from something internal.   It is difficult to raise most song birds; they require various diets and frequent feeding and a bit of luck. Nevertheless, I am always incredibly sad when things go badly.  On another note, summer finally seems to have gotten here so out of the house it was, finally. Went to the river with Tobi this morning, again this afternoon to do some fishing. Didn't catch anything but that doesn't really matter - it was just wonderful. The grass and weeds and everything growing there is almost three feet high and in full bloom - Tobi loved running through the tall grass. It was just good to be out.  This morning I sprayed my roses for the third and last time this season, they seem to be holding up well against fungi this year. Then I sawed off a few branches of the moor birch in front of the porch to get a bit more sunlight for the roses and for the other flower bed. It was good to be outside doing things!  Early tomorrow there is a fishing derby at a neighboring fishing club that we will be taking part in; it means getting up early but the weather tomorrow is supposed to be just as wonderful as today, so that is no problem for me. This fishing club is a lot of fun; they even set up tables and benches by the lake and serve brew and good bavarian eats. Hmmmm.

       Who is programming at Epson   or translating their source code??!!   I was on the german Epson page today because in my mind, my Stylus 670, though printing good quality pictures, always seems to print everything a tad darker than it ought to be.  I got this error message:     This sentence makes absolute no sense at all in German. I did run it through the  urlLink Heisoft  translation software and the english version of the sentence is "Let the requested selecting come in.".  Let the requested selecting come in? Come in where? And what's a requested selecting? And how should I let it come in? Geez guys.  On another note, now that I have finally stopped blubbering over Coco's sudden departure, we have a new guest. A lady brought us a young song thrush half an hour ago. We took her to have the vet take a look at her as she has somewhat of a swelling behind her head. Most likely, she was in the clutches of a cat at some point. She is already advanced enough in development so that raising her should be no problem.   Here a photo of an adult song thrush, courtesy of  urlLink Birds of Britain .     A lovely song bird!

       I Hate Goodbyes   This morning while I was cooking, he was dropping raisins into the ventilation slits on my air extractor hood in the kitchen. Now, he is gone.    One of his favorite pasttimes - the small ribbon for pulling the battery out of the laptop sticks away from the computer and he loved pulling on it.    He had even gotten used to Tobi's presence.    Loved sleeping on the arm of my reading lamp.    Or "sunning" himself above the light bulb in the dining room lamp.  Just before lunch, I wanted to go check on something and he flew past me and out the door. Sat in the walnut tree for a while, then in one of the chestnuts by the road. All attempts to coax him down were to no avail. Back to the walnut tree, by the time I got up on the roof he was gone. Best of luck to you, little Coco. T'was quite an honor to have gotten to know you. Soar, little fella, soar. Goodbye.

       Completely New Website...   under construction but partially available. So, if you're bored or curious or both, go  urlLink here.   I welcome all comments and criticism.  The german language version will be uploaded tomorrow - I have been sitting at this laptop since 9 this morning and my eyes are turning square ;-))

       Toads and Frogs   We went down to the  urlLink river  with Tobi today as the rain finally let up in the afternoon.  On the way back, we noticed many very small toads and/or frogs on the road - here is a foto of three of them:     I think one of them is a frog, but they are so incredibly small (about 1/2 inch in length) that it is difficult to tell. The three in the photo have been given a new home next to the pond in the garden.  It is wonderful to have toads and frogs - we have at least two pretty large toads - sometimes you see them in the evening. At least one large frog is also present, in the spring, he made an awful lot of noise which was absolutely lovely. It is just too bad that you can hear him, but rarely or never see him.  Toads are very useful creatures - they decimate the snail and slug population. To some, they might be unpleasant, I think they are absolutely wonderful!

       We're still here...   it only rained quite heavily and we had some strong winds, but other than that we were lucky. Not so lucky were the areas in and around the beautiful bavarian city of  urlLink Regensburg  where trees and poles were knocked over, hail broke window panes, etc.  My roses did just fine.  My movie tip of the week: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 - it is entertaining, informative and a must see for all voters. To those who have decided not to see it, I have only one question: Why not - are you afraid of maybe having your beliefs shaken up a bit? Staunch Bush supporters will have their beliefs shaken up - whom they end up voting for is their business - but at least see the film!

       Thunderstorms and Possible Tornadoes   have been predicted for our region late afternoon and evening - yes, oddly enough tornadoes - so I decided to photograph my roses before they get all rained away.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      (click for larger image)  It has been quite a battle with my roses in the last few years - they kept getting  urlLink Black Spot . In addition to spraying them three times in the summer with a fungicide, I have been regularly disinfecting the soil they are in with a stock made of  urlLink horse tail weed . It would be more than wonderful to finally get a grip on this problem - I have 28 roses!  Well, it is getting darker out there 'cause the clouds are getting thicker - am going to go "batten down the hatches"!

       Busy   If someone asked me "doing what", I honestly could not tell you, but somehow the days are just gone in no time.  Coco is keeping me hopping - he still insists on being fed every half hour or so, despite the fact that he is already perfectly capable of eating by himself.  Yesterday I was cooking (Rigatoni Arrabiata) and he spent the entire time on my shoulder. As I am writing this he is alternatively sitting on my right wrist and hopping around on the keyboard or mouse. Cute little bugger.  I need to get my taxes done this week or next - am loving that. One of my favorite pasttimes :-(( However, the fact that I might get some money back is a bit of a motivation. It is again, just paper, paper and more paper - sometimes I wonder how come there are any trees left in the world.  On a positive note,  urlLink Dante's  struggle to store his good wines properly has made me really appreciate the fact that I have a "real" basement.   I am not sure - did I post about the accidentally created strawberry champagne? This time of year, strawberries are sold by the side of the road in big booths which look like giant strawberries - yes, they literally destroy the sightseeing. Anyhow, they also sell strawberry wine, of which I usually buy a few bottles. It is an excellent aperitif. Last fall, I opened one of those bottles and put the cork back in and placed it in the door of my refrigerator, where I promptly forgot about it. I really don't pay much attention to the bottles in the door because they are all capable of long-term storage. I rediscovered the bottle in late spring and, much to my surprise, it was now a sparkling wine. The taste was exquisit - Dom Perignon here I come, lol.   Gotta stop typing now - Coco has falling asleep on my wrist and has his head between his wings - sleeping peacefully.

          Happy 4th of July!   I can imagine all those BBQs getting cranked up, ice cream, water melons, ribs, hmmmmm I gotta stop or I'll get hungry.  Especially in light of the fact that in the past few months I seem to have put on a few extra pounds and am not happy about it. So, during my daily dog walks I am using the weights on my feet and arms (Nicht schimpfen, Gene, ist nur vorübergehend). It seems to make a lot of difference and I certainly feel like I am getting a half-way decent workout. I have promised myself to supplement that with the crunches suggested, but I haven't been able to convince myself to start yet..... I despise stomach muscle exercises and always have.  I have been kept pretty busy the last two days by Coco. He is just fascinated as heck about my laptop and thinks it is cool to hop around the keyboard. He can't really break anything on it but I am afraid he might put a hole in the LCD display with his beak, so I am keeping him away from it. He is sleeping on my shoulder as I am writing this.  He really is very young - I noticed this not only from the "nest beak" he still has. Coco has definite sleeping and eating patterns, just like a toddler. Feed me. Let me play. I need to sleep. Awake! Feed me! and so on, and so on, and so on.  He is incredibly cute and very curious about everything. Will post some more pix of him in the next couple of days.

       Coco   So this is Coco, a jackdaw approximately four weeks old (note the beak):     He has had a heck of a good time here in the house this morning. Coco seems to have an affinity for stamp booklets:     ...and wanted to see just who all is listed in my rolodex:        And, after all of that excitement, boy was he hungry!

       Big Day   Well, I finally got all my marriage certificates and divorce decrees and birth certificate and school report cards and my personal resume and my statement from the Illínois State police certifying that I have not committed any felonies....  and took all that paper along with my Application for Citizenship and dropped it off at the immigration office.  Whew.  I have actually been chewing on this for two years, but the thing that has kept me from moving forward was the certified translations of the divorce decrees by a court admitted translator. Why are divorce decrees always so long, anyhow?!  Am feeling wonderful. In maybe three months I will be back to my birth status and to the person I have always been.  Though the case officer at immigration told me I was the first american wanting to be a german - it is usually the other way round, he said. I just grinned.  I hope that all who know me will understand this decision, I have pondered it for 11 years now and it is the right thing for me. Am just hoping I will have my american citizenship long enough to help vote W out of there.  I canned my jalapeno and cayenne crop from last year today. I had frozen them all (they freeze most excellently) but my freezer is small and I needed the room so I canned them. Am figuring this is ok, will taste one tomorrow to see if it was, indeed ok.  The jackdaw is doing wonderfully. He eats like a horse but young birds need to get up and be fit quickly. The man who brought him, Mr. M., visited him again today. Apparently his wife spent the entire evening yesterday crying because they had gotten so attached to him. He is a cute little bugger - incredibly nosy, checks out everything, hides food, what can I say - a classic CORVUS!  Gotta go watch soccer now. Portugal beat the Netherlands yesterday in the semi-finals and will be playing the winner of tonight's game, Greece vs. Czech Republic. Greece is definitely the underdog, they did not expect to get to the semi-finals at all and have offered Greek Citizenship to the german coach of the team, Otto Rehagel. Lol.

       Kinda dropped off the   face of the earth for a few days, didn't I?  Things have been quiet and there isn't much going on at the moment. We celebrated my father's birthday with an informal grill party - it was nice and the kids were fun.  The fish aren't biting so there has not been anything to report on that front either.  I watched "Catch me if you can" last night and was not very impressed - the story is a good one, but somehow the movie didn't really knock me off the couch, if you know what I mean. Probably should have just stuck with watching Discovery Channel, which I have been doing quit a bit as of late. The only thing that is a bit frustrating is that at the moment, Discovery seems to be doing an awful lot of repeats - meaning, the stuff coming in the evening is reshown in the morning and then again a few days later. Thus, I switch between Discovery Channel and Animal Planet. Both channels are excellent  for knitting because you can spend more time just listening and less time having to look.  We  got a bit of rain last night which was good (I would have kicked myself for saying that four weeks ago, lol) because everything was pretty dried out from the wonderfully constant summer weather we are currently blessed with. I have got oodles of cayenne peppers (though they're still green) and am wondering where the jalapenos are - I guess they take longer. Finally, the first tomates are getting red and I am looking forward to them - at last a tomato which tastes like a tomato and not like a glass of water!  I have enjoyed the weekend (as I always do). It is kind of odd, being unemployed and enjoying the weekend, I know. However, during the week I force myself to keep a rather rigorous schedule (which includes getting up at 6:30 a.m.) and keep busy with the job hunt and all. On the weekend, I let myself bum around and be lazy, and just enjoy the weather and the outdoors. Which is why I tend to blog more during the week - hardly turn the computer on over the weekend.  Yaaaawwwwnnn. I am getting boring and will end this post here.

       Isn't Summer just Lovely?   Since I was such a good girl with all that paperwork yesterday, and since there were no new jobs in print and media to apply for, I decided to give myself the day "off".  After posting off my tax stuff, I took a wonderful long walk with Tobi in the mid-morning sun. The corn is high, the wheat is golden, and the "beaten path" is dry and dusty. Insects swirl about, bees are busily collecting pollen and the birds have ceased singing. What a wonderful time of year!  Did a bit of puttering around the garden and porch before lunch, did a little here and a bit there.  This afternoon I decided to take advantage of the sun - the wonderful tan I had six weeks ago has all but disappeared. So, I got out my chaise lounge, fetched a margarita and put a Garth Brooks tape in the walkman. Didn't last but an hour in the sun though, as our temperatures are well in the 80s.  Tonight, we are going to enjoy those eels we have been catching; we smoked them this afternoon.  And maybe it will be a warm evening and we will be able to sit outside for ages - think it's time to get my harmonica out....

       I tend to procrastinate   when it comes to unpleasant tasks. However, I did plunge into it this morning and finally did all my tax returns. Yippee. Was worried about perhaps owing the state a bit of money, but it turns out that the state owes me a bit (though not much) - that is, if they accept everything as I have submitted it.  Enjoying the summer weather here. Been eel fishing the last two nights, and it is just wonderful to sit at the lake at 10:30 in the evening in short sleeves. This is not unusual in some parts, I realize, but it sure is here. Most summer evenings are rather cool. Last Wednesday morning when I got up for instance, the morning temperature was 48 F degrees - and that is a bit crisp for this time of year.  Back to the eels. I guess they do not get eaten much in the US, however, they are considered a delicacy in most parts of Europe. I guess people get kind of uneasy since they are so snake like - though in no way related. And yes, they are slimy - it is impossible to hold one in your hand, you need a dry towel or such. They taste quite good in a lot of ways - my favorite is smoked eel.  Eels are fascinating creatures. They are spread all over the planet in Europe, Asia, etc. However, when they get sexually mature, they return to the Sargasso Sea (near Bermuda) to spawn.  All freshwater eels, both american and european - come from the Sargasso Sea and return to it to spawn.  When the eggs hatch, the small baby eels (now called glass eels) return to various fresh waters and rivers in Europe, Asia and the United States, travelling thousands of miles.
