       What is the deal with posers? I hate them so much. People who pretend to be something thy're not, or something they're really bad at. For example, why would you pretend to be a skater, buy I-Paths, buy a new deck, talk about it as if you know about it, when you are not? Just 'cuz you have a longboard, it doesn't mean that you are a skater. Be what you are, not what you think is cool. And another thing, why the hell would you want to BE a skater? Skater are smelly, dirty rich kids who want to rebel and pretend that they are punks. Why? I dont know...    Or another example. When you are only half Italian, and your Italian Dad is born in Canada, why would you say that you are Italian? Why would you want to be Italian? All they're good for is cars and leather shoes, and Dolce et Gabbana. And Ginos. Lots and lots of Ginos. So if you are half Italian, and half WHITE, you can not go around calling people munja-cakes (durogatory term for white, or non latino) because you are one. So dont pretend to be an Italian cuz you think the girls like it. (plus they dont, cuz Italians are greasy.)    And the worst kind of posers, are the hippie posers. WHY IN THE HELL OF IT ALL, WOULD YOU WANT TO BE A HIPPIE???? They are a bunch of dirty, smelly, unshaven, unbathed, layed-back, Jimi Hendrix listening morons, who work in health stores and salad bars. If you want to be like that, why dont you come to me, and I'll just kick you in the face, it'll be much easier on you and your family. I do not understand why being a hippie is so widely accepted in our society. IT'S NOT COOL! Just cuz you smoke weed too much you're NOT COOL. Remember that, you'll tell it to your kids one day.    So, in conclusion, dont pose, cuz basically everyone can see through you, and they know that you are just pretending to be cool. (by the way, you're not.)

      Anyway, I have come to the conclusion that old people should be allowed to go into space...permanently. Its perfect because they can easily be tricked. Tease them with a rerun of Matlock, throw the tape into the rocket ship, lock the door behind them, and shoot them to the moon. The government should fund this because most old people just complain about prescription drugs and how the government should favor them. This would get them off the government's tail, and give me peace of mind. Honestly, how many old people have any use these days? My grandpa and grandma own. They can stay, but only because they are cool. Willie Mays can stay. John Cleese and the members of Monty Python definitely get to stay. Sean Connery can stay too. Aside from that, leave the other old people that are only around to piss teenagers off by calling them "hoodlems" for standing on the sidewalk in front of their houses to put them on the rocket. Then we wont have to listen to their whining and constant complaining. "Wheres the inflight movie?! Is it MAAAAAATLOOOOOOCK?!" and "I dont want orange juice! I want PRUNE JUICE YA NINCOMPOOP!! Some of our elders are wise. The rest are just paranoid and demented. Send them to the moon...forever.

      Fellow Admins, You DO NOT have to comment on your on material. You posted it so, as a caption write your comment. You are filling our comment boxes with crap. Try to let the readers comment, and if they insult you, dont come up with a lame comeback, instead make an embarassing post about the person who insulted you. It is much more effective, and will make you look cool. Readers may come and go as they please, so feel free to insult them back, publicly.   Readers, if you insult us,you will be ridiculed tenfold. We might even start a rumor that you had gay relations with a pig. So, Readers be ware. Matt, you saw what happened. However, Readers, if your comment is well-formulated or stands on goodground for an insult, you will be left alone.                                -The Administration  To Keep You Happy a link   urlLink Better Than Our Website    aka the lamest game ever.

      About a year ago, a customer from Roswell, NM, called a Computer Store to place an order. To break the ice, the representative jokingly asked if he or any of his neighbors had seen any aliens lately. The guy laughed and proceeded to tell him all about the "crazies" that not only live in Roswell but who come on vacation there in hopes of seeing a UFO themselves. As he talked, the representative processed the order, and the last bit of information he needed to complete it was the guy's e-mail address for marketing purposes.   So after being asked for his e-mail, the guy started ranting into the phone: "Email! I won't have anything to do with that Internet or modems of any sort! You should be careful about those. Don't you know that once you install a modem, the government can look into your computer and watch everything you do? That's why every night before I go to bed, I turn the monitor to the wall..."

      A Danish IT company has given all its employees free subscriptions to internet pornography sites. LL Media in Nordjylland introduced the idea to stop staff accessing adult material at work. The company's director, Levi Nielsen, believes access to porn is a natural fringe benefit, like a free phone or a company car.  "We know that 80% of all hits on the Internet are on porn sites. And we can see that people also surf porn pages during work," Nielsen told Danish broadcaster DR Nordjylland. Nielsen hopes the move will make his staff more relaxed and more efficient on the job.

      Appropriate and Inappropriate Humor Penned by: Misha Evgrafov — PhD/Boy of Destiny      Appropriate and inappropriate humor depends on the person or group you are with. There are many jokes you can make, some more racy than others, but all will probably get you some dissapproval from your peers. For example, when you are with a blonde specimen of the female species, it wouldn’t be appropriate to make a dumb blonde joke because  the other party might, and probably will get offended. On the other hand, if you are with a disrespectful booze hound (he will remain nameless) then a dumb blonde joke is a very, very good thing to ease up your conversation, or make Matt laugh. So, as you can see, the sex of your partner or group matters immensely.    Appropriate and inappropriate humor depends on the timing of your joke. For example, if you are talking to your friend about the death of his mother, a comment making fun of his mother, like “Your mothers so fat, when she stepped on the bathroom scale it showed her phone number!” probably is inappropriate (unless of course he/she hated his/her mother, but that’s a different topic). On the other hand, when someone insults you, and if you have to retaliate, it is very appropriate, and even polite, to insult his mother by saying something like “Your mother is so dumb, she stood on a chair to raise her IQ!” Also, when in class or at a formal event of some sort, it is unwise and inappropriate to make fun of, and comment on words (whether they be in English, or some other language) like “annis” (L.), “but” (E.), “concubine” and “aspect” (both E.). “But, but, but, but, I like to make fun of words!” you say? Well don’t, because it will lead to being kicked out of class, and you can take my word for it because I am an expert at this sort of thing.        Appropriate and inappropriate humor depends on the type of humor that it is. For example, dirty jokes, (which there will be no example of), racist jokes, (ditto), homophobic jokes, (SAA), and especially anti-Semitic jokes, (nope), are very inappropriate in most branches of the society. If you make an anti-Semitic joke in public, especially when there are Jews around, you will probably get the snot kicked out of you. If you make a homosexual joke, you will probably get the snot kicked out of you. If you make a racist joke, you will DEFINITELY get the S**T kicked out of you. Dirty jokes, however depend on the crowd you are with, (refer to p.1) and will sometimes get a few looks, sometimes a few offensive comments towards your mother (refer to p.2), but will mostly get laughs, especially if its funny.        Appropriate and inappropriate humor depends on how funny the joke is. If the joke is sidesplittingly funny, then chances are, most people will get a stitch from laughing to much, and will forget about how offensive the joke might have been. But if its not funny at all, or barely funny, you will probably get a few insults thrown your way for having no sense of humor, and for being a tremendous dumbass.*                 *Notice how the essay ends with DUMBASS.....

       A student who admits down-loading material from the internet for his degree plans to sue his university for negligence. Michael Gunn claims his university should have warned him his actions were against the regulations.    The Times Higher Education Supplement reports that he was told on the eve of his final exams that he would get no marks for his course work.    The University of Kent at Canterbury says students are warned about plagiarism.    Michael Gunn, a 21-year-old English student, told the Times Higher: "I hold my hands up. I did plagiarise. I never dreamt it was a problem.    I can see there is evidence I have gone against the rules, but they have taken all my money for three years and pulled me up the day before I finished.    If they had pulled me up with my first essay at the beginning and warned me of the problems and consequences, it would be fair enough.    But all my essays were handed back with good marks and no one spotted it."

      A mortician was working late one night. It was his job to examine the dead bodies before they were sent off to be buried or cremated.  As he examined the body of Mr. Steinbrenner, who was about to be cremated, he made an amazing discovery: Steinbrenner had the longest private part he had ever seen!   "I'm sorry Mr. Steinbrenner," said the mortician, "But I can't send you off to be cremated with a tremendously huge private part like this. It has to be saved for posterity." And with that the coroner used his tools to remove the dead man's schlong.  The coroner stuffed his prize into a briefcase and took it home. The first person he showed was his wife. "I have something to show you that you won't believe," he said, and opened his briefcase.  "Oh my God!" she screamed, "Steinbrenner is dead!"   The Joke of the Week comes out every Friday.

      Becky was on her death bed with her husband, John, maintaining a steady vigil by her side. As he held her fragile hand, his warm tears ran silently down his face, splashed onto her face, and roused her from her slumber. She looked up and her pale lips began to move slightly. "My darling John," she whispered.   "Hush, my love," he said. "Go back to sleep. Shhh. Don't talk."   But she was insistent. "John," she said in her tired voice. "I have to talk. I have something I must confess to you."   "There's nothing to confess," replied the weeping John. "It's all right.   Everything's all right, go to sleep now."   "No, no. I must die in peace, John. I slept with your brother, your best friend and your father."   John mustered a pained smile and stroked her hand. "Hush now Becky, don't torment yourself. I know all about it." he said, "Why do you think I poisoned you?"

      Cobra, are you retarded? Do you know what "proper grammar" means? You see, they teach people that titles are capitalised in grade 3. Unless you're retarded, I can't see how that doesn't stick in your tiny, stupid brain. It's not that hard! Titles=Capitalised first letter of every word. God...And by the way, tainted is misspelled you dumbass. There's spell check for a reason. Figure out how to press the spell check button, and you wil have no more spelling mistakes...GET IT??

       urlLink    Those who believe that masturbation is unnatural and ungodly should note the above diagram. This shows clearly and irrefuteably that God meant for us to masturbate. Years of painstaking research have gone into this finding. The proof lies in the length of the human arm. Whether through evolution or by direct design, God has ensured that the human arm is exactly the perfect length to reach the genitals (or "Rude Bits" as they are known in scientific circles). If God had not wanted us to masturbate, he'd have given us short arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

      I recall a conversation that my mother and I had about five years ago. I had been begging and pleading with my mom to let me sign up with an ISP for Internet access, but the answer was always no. Eventually, after months of whining, she agreed. I was thrilled and I told her I would go price modems that day. "Hold on," she said. "What are you talking about modems?"  I explained to her that in order to connect our computer to the phone line, we would need a modem. "Forget that," my mother bellowed. "We'll get the Internet now, but the modem can wait until next year."  (This did not happen to me)

      A 50-year-old Zambian man has hanged himself after his wife found him having sex with a hen, police said Friday.   The woman caught him in the act when she rushed into their house to investigate a noise.   "He attempted to kill her but she managed to escape," a police spokesman said.   The man from the town of Chongwe, about 50 km (30 miles) east of Lusaka, killed himself after being admonished by other villagers.   The hen was slaughtered after the incident.   urlLink LINK   I bet his wife was really ugly...What else in hell would drive this guy to fuck a CHICKEN?

      Dont You Just hate when someone truly believes they are superior. Kinda like Mongo. His Post was was completely out of nowhere and irrelevant. First of all, you are a true poser. You dont dress like a group. But you do dress like an athlete when you are clearly not.    You are draped in child-made clothing, thus making you a horrible person. Your shoes, which for some reason you paid 200 dollars for, cost ten dollars to make and probably took a child 2 hours to make. And the insults, buddy, you are as you call yourself. a Mongo.   So stop trying to make yourself look smart by indirectly insulting your fellow admins. It's puerile. If you, you overspender you, have a problem, which i know you do, tell me, so i can beat the shit out of you, steal your bumblebee shoes and throw them in a fucking woodchipper.   And buddy, you are calling me a rebel without a cause? You stayed at home for 2 monthes last year 'cause you convinced mommy little mishakins had a tummy ache. So shut up you mommas boy. I cawnt go to a movie my mommy wont let me. ahh boo hoo.   Buddy, Hoobastank and Nike. You predictable teenager you. Thank god that you dont like Fubu, Ecko, and Basketball shirts. There are too many of you. Stop fucking buying nike. Its pathetic. If you jogged, ok. But to lounge around in and type on a computer, you might as well be wearing a moo-moo for your daily activities you house-hippo.  And by the way the leafs fucking suck(there is a reason they arent in the playoffs anymore)So im sorry you saturday night activity of subwaying to the acc to get autographs and then coming home to jerk off to signed matt sundin cards has been discontinued, but man, Cry me a river, Build Me a bridge and get over it.    Please feel free to publish your opinion in the comments. Mongo needs some sense, and if you dont yell at him, i will drive his mothers dildo through his fucking skull.  With the attributes you gave for hippies, it sounds like you fit the bill.  And by the way, just cause you country was communist doesnt mean you have to make up for all the years of capitilism you missed. INEJUSSKIDING!   But, Mongo. Kill yourself you marsupial motherfucker.
