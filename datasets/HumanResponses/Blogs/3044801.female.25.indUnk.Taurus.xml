      I don't know who that is - husband tells me a labor leader of some sort - but he was important enough to get a state holiday and close state offices for the day. Husband has been in California since 1997, me since 1998 (except for that span from summer to summer  2002-3), and this was the first we'd ever heard of it. Found out when we went to the DMV to register the car and they were closed. At a guess, state workers go bowling on their day off, because the parking lot at the alley up the street was jammed when we drove past.  And because of state offices being closed, husband was unable to call about unemployment status...  I'm more concerned about that as a matter of survival than anything. If I could, I'd walk on the marriage right this second. He's just so ... so ... ARGH! inducing. I'd purchased some frozen dinners because I figured, if I was sleeping come time he got hungry (which I have been lately), he could pop a couple in the microwave and fix himself dinner. But what does he do? "[Silkenglider], it's 8," which as I've said earlier, is code for, "Get up and feed me." I got out of bed, went into the kitchen, and said in as sweet of a tone as I could muster, "See, what you do is, you open the freezer door, and take out a couple of frozen dinners." He replies, "And then?" and I answered in my same sweet one, "Then... you open them, read the instructions, put them in the microwave, cook 'em, and eat 'em."  I mean, my god!, he can't even microwave himself a fucking Banquet dinner! Hell - last week I bought a couple of pre-made salads that come with dressing and a fork and did he eat dinner when I didn't get up? NO! He just didn't eat, then came to bed with a semi-whiny, "It's [whatever] o'clock."  Well excuse the FUCK out of me for trying to escape my crappy life in the only way I have available at the moment. I'd commit suicide, but ... meh. Whatever. Shit, when I finally get a job, it'll probably be evening hours so that I have transportation, so what the hell is he going to do then? He'll be 49 damn years old on Saturday and he can't even fix a fucking god-damned frozen dinner! Or, more accurately, WON'T.   ARGH!  Ahem.  Sorry.  I don't think I'm cut out to live with other people.  signed - Me

      Still waiting to get a decision on husband's unemployment.  If it doesn't go through, I don't know what's going to happen.  I'm terrified.  signed - Me

      I didn't go for my walk yesterday morning because I was too damn tired - I hosted a first anniversary chat for my forum on Sunday, so I had to mess with my sleep schedule. Aside from that, I was ... well ... see below - just not in the mood. And today it's  looking like crappy weather. So I may only get in three walks this week, provided the weather clears up for the rest of it.   On Saturday, we checked the distance: 2.4 miles per walk. That's pretty good. Takes me 50 minutes, though, so I could be walking faster. But the speed I'm going now wipes me out fairly well. However, faster walking will happen, eventually. And maybe someday .. I'll start jogging it .. (oh, the horror. I  hate  running. Sets off what asthma I have big time [it's very mild asthma that rarely ever rears it's head, and when it does, it's usually just a tiny wheeze and some coughing. I think carrots set it off a bit, and some leafy greens in a raw state. But running or other really strenuous exercise is heinous. I always feel like my chest will cave in when I do it. But I've been reading up, and it seems that if you stop when it starts to hit, wait a couple of minutes, and start again, or if you can manage to work through it, you can get it to hold off for longer periods of time. It seemed to be working when I was working out on my elliptical a couple of years ago, so maybe I can get into running someday. Who knows.])  I wish it would decide to either be nice weather, or not nice weather, and stop with the nice-weather teasing.  signed - Me

      In fact, it's excellent. Being awake means thinking, and thinking means pain, and pain means crying, and I hate crying. When I sleep, I don't have to deal with any of that.  To give you a picture of my current frame of mind, here's my diary entry from 3/29:     Dear Universe -  [Husband] didn't get the [job] job. Unemployment benefit on shaky ground. IRS wolves at the door. $6-700 to live on after rent is paid. Bills piling up. No income.  I'm tired of living in a state of constant fear and uncertainty, not knowing what's going to happen, having no security, a deep, abiding loneliness. I only vaguely remember what happiness feels like. There's a constant knot in my stomach, along with heartburn. I cry almost daily because I feel so ... empty. I want to run and hide, but have nowhere to go. Want to be held and comforted, but have nobody to accommodate.  Hope is gone.  If it does show up, it gets crushed.  There's no way out. No road back to happiness, no light at the end of the tunnel.  [unatheistic plea for help edited out]  - [Me]    The day's events that led to that:   Husband's call with the California unemployment insurance appeals board. Apparently one of the forms of ID he submitted wasn't the right type, and his birthdate on his driver's license is incorrect. So the UE has been held up for a couple of months trying to get things straightened around. Today during the hearing, he was asked if he had his birth certificate available to fax a copy of. He didn't think he did, believing it to be down south in storage with most of the rest of our things, and was starting to sound downright panicky. Fortunately, I knew where it was and was able to dig it out right quick. Oddly, the incorrect birthdate didn't affect UE when he lost his job in 2001, so I'm not sure why it affected it this time, except maybe they toughened things up since 9/11. Whatever. It's been a pain in the ass this go 'round, and we really need the money. I don't know of any reason why it shouldn't go through, but there's always that chance. So until we know for sure, this is a big stressor.  And in today's mail... First item, rejection letter for a job husband had recently interviewed for. *sigh*  Second item, a notice of intent of levy and seizure from our pals at the IRS. I won't get into the background right now, suffice it to say we owe a lot more than we can pay (from 2000 taxes .. or was it '99? I forget at the moment. I remember doing '98 taxes, but can't remember '99.. where were we at then? Christ. '99's a total blank) and have no way to pay it at the moment. After answering a bunch of questions, it was determined that if husband files his 2002 and 2003 taxes by April 15th, and I get my 2003 filed by April 15th, and we call them back, we will likely be granted hardship status until such time as we're able to make arrangements for payment. That's something, I guess. Penalties and interest will continue to accrue, and the debt is not forgiven, but at least they're not going to come after us with tar and feathers just yet.  Was a peachy day. I love dealing with the government, don't you? By the way, Ben&Jerry's Brownie Batter ice cream is really good stuff.  signed - Me

      Ladies and gentlemen.   As you may be aware, there are many people walking around in a cloud. They are in a state of functioning brain death. These people have a brain, a brain that's functioning enough to keep them alive, walking around, interacting with people. But for whatever reason, that's  all their brain does. In classic joke vernacular, these people would be blonde, but they come in all hair-colors. In the common sense, they are simply stupid.  We're not sure why the brains of these people don't process critical thoughts, thoughts that keep those of us with more fully functioning brains from doing and saying stupid things. Our scientists have spent millions of dollars of grant money and dozens of years researching this phenomenon, and have not yet reached an answer.  Sadly, their grants have almost run out. Soon, there will not be enough money for them to continue their research, research that may one day find a cure.  But ladies and gentlemen,  you can help ! We need  your  contributions to  find a cure for stupidity ! We're not asking much - a few pennies here and there, maybe a couple of dollars. But if enough of us combine our efforts, there is  hope  that one day, this horrible malady may be erradicated!  Won't you please help?  Send your donations to:  Functioning Brain-Dead Cure-a-Thon 1 Telethon Way Anytown, USA 12486  Thank you!  signed - Me

      I run a forum (no, I won't link to it here). Yesterday, it got hit by a group of trolls that has been running around the forum system and trying to get forums shut down or to go on self-moderation (as I'd been considering SM this past week anyhow, I  went ahead with that. Straw that broke the camel's back. I don't consider it giving in as I'd already been thinking it over.)  This particular group's tactics are (from another forum on that site):   Step One Invade to go after other posters  Step Two Post porn  Step Three Start a fight  Step Four Mail the Wizard and mods  Step Five Extreme Fighting, name calling etc.  Step Six Complain to Mods about the other poster  Step Seven File TOS that Mods are not performing  Step Eight Trash The Forum  Step Nine Move on  Step Ten Plan the next attack.     Who. The fuck. ARE THESE PEOPLE?! I don't mean, specifically (though that would be nice to know so I could go to their homes and torment them), but in general. Who are these losers that have nothing better to do with their time than cause trouble on the internet? And these aren't teenagers, either. They're adults in their 20s, 30s, and 40s (or so the profiles say.)  They can't be like this in real life - they wouldn't be able to hold down a job, or maintain a relationship, except with other similarly dysfunctional people, or interact with the general public.  I'm also irritated because it makes a lot of cleanup for me and my forum staff, but that's beside the point.  I wonder things like - do they think about this sort of thing when they're not online? Sit around all day dreaming of their online havoc wreaking? When they're in their old age, will they be thinking back on their "glory days", wishing they could relive them? Still be doing this sort of crap in their old age? I can't imagine they'd be ashamed of doing this. Do they tell their friends and spouses, "I was online yesterday, and went to a forum where I insulted all the members, posted illegal porn, and tried to get it shut down"? Do they do this from work, or just from home?   Boggles my mind. I can be catty and bitchy, sure, but these people are plain  nasty  critters. Have to wonder 'bout people like that.  signed - Me

      I don't think I'm a sub.   For starters, I talk too much. I sometimes say no. I want to know why I should do something, and "Because I said so," isn't my idea of an answer. And yes, I want an answer. If I didn't want an answer, I wouldn't  have asked the question, or put forth the idea. "Do as you're told and never question," is not my idea of a good relationship.  Further, I'm sass-mouthed. Call me slut, I'm likely to call you ass. It depends on the general interplay. Some people I wouldn't call names back, or say, "fuck you" or "bite me" to. Those people have also never exasperated me. Or are my parents.   I also want a say in what movie we go see, or what restaurant we'll eat at. I want pizza, you want steak, so we compromise and go for Mexican, which neither of us wanted but being miserable together is better than one of us being ticked that we didn't get pizza for the tenth time out.   Sometimes I do things to provoke a reaction. It's fun. Call it topping from the bottom if you want to, but I think that's a lot of nonsense. My opinion is, "topping from the bottom" is directing every bit of it. It's not saying, "Please spank me," when I want spanked, but also, "Don't spank me there, and not so hard, and spread your fingers out, and get that red paddle to use, not the rubber one, the plastic one, and ..." you get the picture. If you don't like being provoked, don't react if I try it. How hard is that? But it's more fun for both of us if you do, and you know it, or you wouldn't, and I wouldn't, either.  I'll make faces at you, tease you, be playful. Sometimes I'll act that way in public, though I'd never totally disrepsect you there, and I would hope you'd do the same. In fact, if you do try to totally disrespect me in public, you'll have a fight on your hands.  So apparently to a lot of people, I'm not being a sub. Or not sub enough. But you know something? I don't think I care. Why should I have to suppress my innate personality just because you don't like it? If you'd ask it of me, you aren't somebody I need around me. You don't like who I am because you want somebody who will kowtow to you. To me, that's not submission, that's doormattism.  But I'm a pleaser, to be sure, and want to do things to make you happy. And I enjoy giving up control. And I want to be on the bottom most of the time.   On second thought, maybe I'm a sub after all.  signed - Me

      Thursday morning's walk was ... wet. It wasn't so bad on the first half, but then the wind picked up and the rain came down a bit faster, and by the time I got home, I was pretty well soaked. BTW, walking  into  a stiff wind is  a hell of a lot harder than walking  away  from it.  I'm trying to decide if I want to go again this morning, but if it's raining and windy, I might not. I want to get in the habit of going for the walk every morning, though. I dunno. I walked in worse weather last time I was in Kansas, and a bit of wind and rain isn't going to melt me. We'll see.  The cow was gone from her spot. I'm not sure if she finally managed to get up, or if she was hauled off somewhere. Either way, she's probably better off than just being in a field on her side, even if "better off" means having been put down.  I've been trying to decide if I want to dye my hair black, or cut it really short. My husband voted for dying it black. Only trouble is, if I dye it black then change my mind, I have to re-dye it back to my natural color (or close to it.) If I cut it really short, I have to wait for it to grow out again. I could leave it as it is, but that's so boring. Maybe I could dye it dark red...  I don't like this blog design. I need to rework it. Thing is, I want to put pictures up, maybe a webcam feed, and there aren't any free hosts that allow remote linking or camming capabilities. If I set it up on my own, there are privacy issues to deal with concerning whois queries (and overall money issues, as well - it takes money, I don't have money). Not to flatter myself, but the last thing I need is a stalker or somebody harassing me on the phone or sending weird crap in the mail. I've done that before - pain in the ass. What is wrong with people like that, anyhow? Seriously - they need a life. A life other than mine. Not that they're not welcome to mine, considering the current state of it. But I'd just as soon keep living it myself, thank you.  AdSubtract has officially pissed me off. I'd put it up to get rid of adbanners (duh) in IE, but if I exit it while running Mozilla, it closes Mozilla down. Irritating.  Speaking of Moz...  Things I like about it: full .png support, skins, can open multiple links out of a site in one window without causing problems with Windows (aka, tabbed browsing)  Things I dislike: doesn't render some sites correctly, doesn't use sites' scroll bar codes, doesn't work with the majority of WYSIWYG editors (and all three sites I frequent use some version of a WYSIWYG editor).   So, I've taken to using Moz. for  urlLink bondage.com , which I open a lot of different links out of, and IE for the other two. Kind of a pain, especially since having too many instances of IE open will crash my computer and makes the task bar look all messy and scrunched up. IE needs some serious work. It could also do with a couple of improvements - like full .png support and tabbed browsing.  Severe topic swerve:  Are men and women capable of being "just friends"? Or does it always end up in a sexual-type thing? I know of people that start out as just friends, then it drifts into a bit more, then have gone back to just friends. Or start as just friends and end up more. Or start out more and end up just friends. But can it ever be just friends the whole time?  Like my  urlLink profile  on  urlLink b.c . I say right from the start in it I'm not looking for anything other than friendship. Further down, I even state in the "My current status is:" thing "Married and unavailable". But I keep getting responses from people that are looking for  more  than friendship. I know it's partially a personals site, but I say, right up front, not looking. (Hell, at the moment it says right up front, "Go away".) And I can tell from the way they talk that they aren't even wanting to  try  to be friends, some even going so far as to attempt to talk me out of that mindset. I'm not sure what they  are  looking for, but it's more than I'm willing or able to offer at this time. I've read my profile several times trying to figure out if I'm sending mixed messages, but unless it's due to some of the pictures I have up, I'm not seeing how I'm doing that. Maybe a couple of little things here and there, but very little things. It doesn't piss me off, really, but it's a tad frustrating when all you want is friendship and all you get is people wanting sex or a relationship you can't offer them.  Which is also bothersome, when I think about it. These people don't  know  anything about me. I don't know anything about  them . They or I could easily be a serial killer or something (I'm not, but I have other issues that drive people off.) So why are they trying to start up anything other than friendship so soon? If I don't like you as friend material, I'm certainly not going to like you as sex or relationship material. And starting up a friendship does not entail asking me about all of my sexual likes and dislikes or the things on my checklist. Yeah, that stuff is fun to talk about eventually, work into conversations here and there.  BUT NOT AS THE BULK OF THE CONVERSATION!  What's so difficult about that? I talk with friends about sex all the time, but it's got an entirely different overtone than what I'm talking about here. A more ... clinical,  laissez-faire  , light-hearted attitude, rather than a serious, "What gets you turned on so I know what to do to you when I've got you in bed," thing.  Another thought ...  Telling people you like them, or worse,  love  them, is a bad idea. They tend to disappear. I was in love with somebody a while back, and never told them because I knew they wouldn't take it well and would disappear. I suppose one could make an argument that I wasn't giving them a choice in the matter by withholding the information, but they didn't seem to mind the results of it - me treating them as being important in my life. That's beside my point, though. My point is ... I don't know what my point is. But my experience has been, you get close to somebody and they find out about it, they disappear. Don't even mention it jokingly because it will just ruin things. Suffer in silence - that's my motto. Relative silence. If I were suffering in silence, this wouldn't be here for you to read, now, would it?  signed - Me

      It's a new (for me) day. My sleep schedule is something like, "go to bed around 7/8/9/10/11 in the morning, get up around 6/7/8 in the evening." I think my husband doesn't care for that, but only because it means he has to feed himself.  In fact, "[Silkenglider], it's [x'o'clock]..." has become code for, "Are you going to get up and feed me or what?" ... I'll probably come back to that at some point.  About the cow.  As I said yesterday, Monday morning (22nd), I went for my first walk in several months. Instead of the route I'd taken before (along each north/south street in town - it's a small town, takes about 45 minutes), I turned down the road that leads out to the beach. I'm in what passes for cattle country in this section of California, and this road has several stands of dairy cows along it.   About an eighth of a mile up the road, off to the left, I see a cow lying on its side. I don't know much about cows, but I do know that they generally don't lay on their side with their legs out in front of them for no reason. Further, the anal region of this particular cow was distended and nasty looking. I stopped to see if she was moving any, but it didn't look like she was, so I figured she was either already dead or soon would be, and that surely her owner would be along the road shortly checking up on his cattle. I continued my walk and went home.  Tuesday morning (23rd), I took the same route. I noticed the cow had moved and her head was now facing the road. I figured the owner had been out, moved the cow, and left it there for some strange reason. I was rather disturbed to have this presumed dead cow staring at the road. On my way back, however, I saw her kicking around and realized, hell, she's not dead, but she's not well off, and apparently NOBODY had yet done anything. There are several houses around, but none close enough to know which one this field and cow belonged to, so I went home.   After consulting some friends, I decided to see who could be called - the friends suggested animal control, but I think cattle are probably not in AC's domain. I called up the county's agricultural extension and asked them who I might report a cow that is about half dead to. They told me to call the sheriff's department and ask for the livestock officer. Which I did. I got records instead, but they said they'd send the livestock officer out to check on things.  This morning (wednesday, 24th) on my walk, I see the cow still lying there, but at least now she has a bale of hay and a bucket of water (though how she's supposed to drink out of the bucket when she's on her side I have no idea. I didn't see a straw...) She was giving a valiant effort to get up, but her anal region was still in bad shape, she's noticibly thin, and I really do expect she'll die. Poor thing. If she is that bad off, they need to put her out of her misery, not leave her lying there.  Next order of bovine business ... There's a stand of about six or seven cows, in a fenced area about 20ft by 40ft, with a thick layer of mud and cow manure. Their food is in it, their water bucket is in it, the cows are standing and lying in it. That can't be good for their hooves, and I hate to think of the germs and whatall they're intaking with the food and water being in it. I'm thinking an anonymous letter to the Humane Society may be in order... (Apparently, I'm a busybody. Who knew? But really, they're living beings. I realize they're a commodity, however that doesn't mean you can treat them badly. There are laws on animal treatment, otherwise there wouldn't be a livestock officer and people wouldn't get arrested for running puppy mills and stuff like that.)  Alright. Mooooving on... (I can hear the groans)  I suppose I should offer some information on myself.   Basic: Female. 24. 5'9", 250-someodd pounds. Measurements available below. Light brown hair. Blue/green eyes. Married.  Expanded: Born May 20, 1979 in the state of Kansas. Grew up there, graduated high school in 1997 at the age of 18, chose not to go to college. Got married in June 1998 at the age of 19 to a man 24 years my senior, moved to California, and became a housewife. In summer 2001, my husband lost his job. The following summer, I returned to Kansas for an indefinite period of time until he could find a decent job again. I found employment at a grocery store and sent money back to help support him. In summer 2003, my husband found good employment, and I returned to California that August. Then in November, the shit once again hit the fan and my husband lost his job. Unfortunately, I had not yet found employment by that time, and his job loss put my own search on hold as it wasn't known where he would once again find employment. It's a weak excuse, I know, but I didn't want to take a job that I might have to quit shortly afterwards. I wish I'd kept looking, but as even the fast food places that had help wanted signs never called back, I don't know that it would have done any good, anyhow.   It is now March 2004. Neither of us is employed, and we are waiting on his unemployment insurance to begin. Though he filled out the paperwork and took in the ID that was requested of him, there was a problem verifying his identity. So instead of starting in late January/early February as was expected, we are waiting for him to have a hearing on March 29th. If it doesn't go well, we are in worlds of trouble. We sold our car in January and got enough from it for a very cheap used car (stick shift, which I am having to learn to drive, so am unable to get around easily) and to live on for a few months, but that money has just about run out. There's enough to cover April rent and some groceries, maybe some partial utility bills. Once it's gone ...   I rather wish I'd never moved to California. It hasn't been particularly kind. The really irritating thing is that my husband has flat refused to move to another state where there is work to be had (even if it is work neither of us really wants) and where it is cheaper to live. I know it's not ideal, but my parents had even offered us rent-free housing (they have a spare room in their basement, and it's quite nice - has its own small bathroom, even) and free food while needed, but he refused to take them up on it. Now, we couldn't afford to get there even if he changed his mind. I can't even do it on my own because there's just not enough money for it this time.  So here I am, stuck in a place I can't afford to live, and desperately wanting a divorce that I can't afford to get.   Oh.   Had I not mentioned that this is a miserable marriage? We don't fight, but you can't fight with somebody you don't talk to. The first six months or so were alright, we were happy enough. But then ... The affection from him disappeared, then the sex, then almost any conversation. I doggedly kept trying, but when you hug somebody and they don't hug back, or kiss them and they don't kiss back, or tell them, "I love you," and it takes them a bit to get out a not-very-heartfelt "I love you, too," and the one time you manage enough courage to try to initiate sex, he gets out of bed ... well ... you get discouraged. Whatever self-esteem you had left starts to go (and if you're somebody who never had much to begin with, it's really hard to bounce back from), and eventually you give up. You stop showing affection because you know it won't be returned, stop saying, "I love you," because it hurts too much to hear it back in a way that isn't meant. I hung on, hoping things would change, and looked at that forced year apart with hope that maybe it would be what we needed to get back whatever we'd lost. But the night I got home...  One might expect that even a couple who hadn't had much between them in nearly four years might possibly have sex the night one of them returns from a year away. But if one had expected that, one would be disappointed. I got a kiss that raised hopes when I got off the train, but that night in the hotel room, trying to snuggle up to him, that hope was dashed. He simply wasn't interested. A year of nightly phone calls that ended with "I love you," was apparently a lie. Neither of us have said it since I returned, either, and from my own side, it's because I don't love him anymore. I care, I suppose - I've been married to him for nearly six years and have known him for almost eight. That's a long time to be with one person, so of course I care. But I don't LOVE. Not anymore.  On top of that, he's a moderately heavy drinker. He can go through a six pack with little ill effect, then go get another the same night. I've seen him go through a six pack of beer and an entire bottle of wine in one night multiple times. When money is a bit more free-flowing, it's at least one four-pack of Guiness or a six pack of something else almost every night. When money is tighter, he buys a six pack every two or three days and only drinks two or three beers a night to make it last. But there's hardly ever a significant stretch of time that he doesn't drink at least two beers a night. And I know there are people reading this saying, "Oh, so he drinks, big deal," but when you've got no income and you're still spending money on alcohol that you should be spending on real necessities, it IS a big deal. And when there's money and you get drunk almost every night, it IS a big deal. Also, it's very difficult to watch, and after a while, I just started being disgusted when I saw him drinking. I'm only glad he's not an abusive drunk. Rather, he just goes to bed. I was always quite pissed when he'd call into work "sick" from a hangover, though. And our trip to Las Vegas ...   What was supposed to be a two day/one night trip, turned into a three day/two night trip because he drank so much of the free wine at the casino blackjack table that he eventually GOT KICKED OUT, then stumbled back to our hotel room, and spent the second day being hungover. We had to call the airline to get our return flight changed, and any activity we might have thought of doing was bagged - I didn't particuarly feel like running around Vegas on my own.  He also smokes. This doesn't bother me so much, but I've decided it's not something I want to deal with in a future partner. Smoking and more than the occassional drink (meaning, drinking more often than I do, and that's hardly at all - maybe a margarita or other mixed drink when we're out to dinner, and that's pretty much it) are high on my "avoid at all costs" list these days.  Then, too, I thought we had some of the same basic goals, namely, a home and kids. But as time went on, it became clear that a home of our own wasn't in the cards, and when I'd bring up children, the answer would be, "In a few years." As it turns out, he's not big on family. I can't get him to call his mother to save my life, even though she keeps calling and hasn't heard from us since last summer (yes, I could write her, and I have before, but dammit, he should call her! She's his mother!) At this time, I don't know that I want children anymore - the ideas of pregnancy and childbirth appall me somewhat: I have friends that have been more than graphically forthcoming with the pertinent details. I don't think I could do it. Maybe adoption someday, but the having my own thing ... merk! And in our current financial and marital situations, it's just as well we haven't had kids. Plus, I can't see having children if my parents won't be able to see them. I don't think it's right to deprive them of seeing their grandkids grow up, so unless I'm in a position to arrange frequent visits, I'd as soon not do it. Besides, I can't get free babysitting if they aren't nearby.   My husband is also really bad with finances. I won't go into that other than to say, paying off all of your credit card debt at once when you have other bills to pay to keep your car from being repo'd and your things in storage from being auctioned off is not the soundest move to make. He also hasn't filed taxes in a couple of years, and with being in tax trouble already, that's a REALLY stupid thing to do.  So you can sort of see why I'm looking at divorce, and really hoping it will be do-able within the next year or so. As soon as I can drive again, I'm going to start putting in job applications. Trouble with that is, once husband has a job, he'll need the car, too, so I'm not sure what hours I can do, except maybe 7pm-3am, and there's not much in this neck of the woods with those sorts of hours. Plus, I think my reference letter from the last job is kind of unusable (it's from August 2003), and unfortunately, one of my three ever jobs was someplace no longer in business, and another I don't think anybody that was there would still be there. It really sucks that if for some reason you didn't work for four years in between jobs, you're considered unviable (or, as in my husband's case, one of your previous employers goes belly up and nobody from there can be found so you've got no references from that job). So I was a housewife, big deal. What if I'd been really sick, or disabled, or in a coma? Actually... that would probably work to my advantage. That's shitty. But if all goes well, in a year-and-a-half, I'll hopefully be living on my own and maybe in school.   A couple of reasons I didn't go to college right out of high school was that, aside from the marriage thing, I thought I knew what I was going to do with my life - be a cook, which you don't really need a college education to be (though it's nice if you can get into a cooking school, but they can be quite expensive). And the other reason was I didn't know what I wanted to study in college and thought it would be a waste of time and money if I was just going to keep changing majors. But now I know I'd like to get into computer graphics, and maybe theatre (behind the scenes type stuff, not center stage stuff - I'm a terrible actress), and some language classes - Spanish, French, perhaps German.  Anyhow ...  With the divorce thing in mind, I've been thinking in terms of what I think the most important quality of personality in a person, particularly a future partner, is. It's come down to consistency/constancy of nature, and follow-through. If a person says they like me or love me, I expect them to act in such a manner - "I love you," is meaningless without the actions. If they say they're going to do something, they do it. If they pass themselves off as a nice person, then be a nice person like, 80% of the time. I guess, maybe to boil it down into one word - genuine. I want somebody that's genuine. That is who they say they are, and act in a way to back it up.   Somebody who says what they mean. The best relationship I had in years I told the person, "Don't ever say anything to me that you don't mean. Don't tell me you want me if you don't, don't tell me you want to spend time with me if you don't." I wasn't asking him not to lie, that's silly, we all lie to one extent or another. Just to not put ideas in my head that he wasn't capable of following through on, or giving me false hopes, or saying or doing things just to make me feel good about myself. He did pretty well at it, and if things hadn't changed so drastically for both of us in November, I like to think he'd have followed through on it all. (Oh, it was nothing grand and life changing that he'd told me, just a lot of little things.)  So, I have goals. I'm saddened that I'm almost 25 and just now getting goals, at a time when there's no way to really accomplish them (when I have a job, I'll be paying the bills, and California's tax board and probably the IRS will both be after my paycheck if husband isn't working by then), but I suppose it's better than never having any.   I feel sorry for my husband. He's going to be 49 in a few weeks. He doesn't have any savings, is jobless, at his age nearly unmarketable it seems, about to be wifeless for the third time (he doesn't KNOW that, but I don't think he'd be surprised to learn it), seemingly incapable of feeding himself... It makes me sad. Then again, I'm heavily depressed, so being sad about things is the mode of my life at the moment.  Ferk. I've written a freakin' novel.   signed - Me

      I am hugely sore from the waist down. I started walking again on Monday (22nd) after three months of not due to crappy weather. I'm not quite sure how far the route I've taken is, but it takes me an hour to do, rather than the 45 minutes the one  I took before was. I'm either walking slower, or the route is longer. And by the time I got home, my hands had swollen up to the point I couldn't get my rings off.  But I am determined to lose the weight I'm carrying around. I'm tired of being fat. Not sure what my current weight is, but at the doctor's in October, I was at 254. I was pleased. I hadn't been moving much since August, when I was at 255, so I held steady through a couple of months of inactivity.  My measurements as of 2:22 am this morning:  Neck - 14.5" L. bicep - 14.25" R. bicep - 14" Chest under arms - 42.5" Bust - 49" Underbust - 43.25" Gut - 49" (gads) Waist (around belly button) - 43.75" Hips - 55.5" Top of L. thigh - 27.75" Top of R. thigh - 28" Calves - 16 7/8" each  I took pictures, but am waiting on a place to put them (and this blog) up on. Not that anybody really needs to see them. Will measure and photo again in a month. If I haven't stopped. I have a tendency not to finish things I start. It's awful.

      March 24, 2004 - The day that ... uh ... I didn't do much of anything except set up a blog. And report a dead (or dying) cow. Who knew there was such a thing as a livestock officer at the sheriff's department?  By the way, I really don't understand some men.  I am not the most trusting individual in the world, and I have a pretty good BS meter, as well as a decent "this person and I are just not going to click" meter. I also have the uncanny ability to tell if somebody is a jerk the second I shake hands at a first introduction, and that has never failed me.   Every once in a while, somebody manages to not set any of that off, and starts to gain my trust. Conversation goes really well, they say they want to be friends, and that goes along really well, then things start to get closer (sometimes remaining platonic, sometimes not), and suddenly - *poof* - they're barely speaking to me anymore. I acknowledge I'm a boring person, but as long as we're not talking about my life, I can hold a fairly decent conversation, even if I do sometimes get into a bout of ... well ... whackiness, to put it nicely. I'm not much of a conversation STARTER, and if the other person isn't giving much response, I do tend to dwindle off, but overall, as long as it's going back and forth, I do ok.   I'm tempted to say it's something about THEM - that always seems to be what people say when you bring these things up, attempting to make you not feel so bad about yourself, which is nice, but is it being honest? Really, this sort of thing happens so often, I think it's something about ME instead. I haven't had many relationships, so maybe I'm simply not catching something that I don't have the knowledge of to be able to catch. I don't know.  But if they're so damned uninterested, why do they keep me around? More importantly, why do I stick around? Why do i keep hoping for something to change when I know perfectly well it's not likely to? Why am I unable to just ... drop them, tell them that if they can't be consistent, I don't need them in my life, then move on?   Maybe it's just that I so rarely seem to click with anybody on any level that makes it difficult. Don't get me wrong, I don't have this trouble with every guy I get along with. There have been plenty I get along with on a buddy level, but even those sometimes ... Maybe guys can't see girls as buddies? Though since I only ever saw them as a buddy sort, it's not quite so bad if they disappear. .. That's a whole other string of thought. No, it's these ones that I click with on a much deeper level, that feel like .. It's silly to say, I suppose, but they almost feel like they could be me, or a part of me, or that if things were vastly different, somebody I wouldn't mind have a real relationship with. It's these ones that are so hellish on my psyche, and I've never quite learned to guard against them.   Thankfully, they're a rarity.  signed - Me

      Husband got his second check yesterday. We can get the alternator for the car, and some food. Thank goodness - we were down to four egg, less than two dozen packs of Ramen noodles, and bread. (I'm glad there are day-old bread stores around. I can get six loaves of bread for less than five dollars, and they last a while.)  Hopefully there's enough power left to get to the parts store, get the alternator, and put it in before the battery runs out.  signed - Me

      So.  We went into "the city" yesterday so I could put in applications at the temp agencies. We get to the first one, park in a side lot, I go up, place is closed.  I walk back to the car so we can go to the next one. Car won't start.  Won't start. Won't start. Won't start.  We call a couple of tow companies. $40 at the first for a jump, $45 at the second. We call the first. Comes out, jumps the car, says it doesn't look like the battery should've been a problem, but that it looks like the alternator isn't working properly. We pay $40, tow guy goes on his merry way.   Put car in reverse ... starts cutting out. Back into neutral. Reverse. Cut. Repeat a few times. Car dies. Won't do anything, not even make that sickly little "i'm trying!" noise.  We walk over to a small auto parts store I saw when we were walking around to find a pay phone. The guy there was WONDERFUL! He says, "Bring your battery in, I'll check it, charge it up as best we can, not charge you for that, when you put it back in, bring the car by and we'll see if it is a problem with the alternator, and won't charge you for that, either." He even lent us tools to take the battery out with! The place made my "recommend to people" list - Finnegan and Nason Auto Parts on F Street in Eureka, CA.  We go back to the car, get the battery out, take it back to the parts store. He checks it and says the battery is junk. It's got no life left in it at all, and if we tried to charge it, it wouldn't hold it. Even showed us on the meter thingy. So we bought a new battery ($47), and he let us borrow the tools to put it back in. We took the car over, and he checked to see if it was charging when the car was running - it's not. We need a new alternator.  When we were in the first time, he looked up the part to see if he had it, he didn't, but could get it overnight. And their other shop didn't have it either. So we'll probably go in today to pick that up. ($84, plus installation if husband can't do it.) The guy gave us a name of somebody who could install it if we can't, said it would probably be about $40. Unfortunately, 40+47+84+40=more than we have, so if husband can't install the alternator (and the man said it shouldn't be all that difficult since it's an older car and gave instructions), we'll have to make due with what we have until the next check comes in because we won't be able to go anywhere since we're running on battery power only.  And we pawned our rings. Loan of $150, four months to pay it back and get the rings back. That will pay the storage bill, anyhow - or at least enough of it to keep them from selling off our stuff.  I've been given a sign, and it says, "Kick Me".  signed - Me

      Husband is denied payment for the weeks forms weren't sent in, but will get the rest of what is owed, which is half of what he was originally eligible for. If we're careful, it will stretch for several months.  We're going to a pawn show tomorrow to see if we  can get a loan on our wedding rings so we can pay the phone bill and the storage bill (I don't care if we lose the stuff, but you should've seen the look he gave me when I said, "It's only stuff, you know.") I suggested selling them, I think we could get a decent chunk of change, but he'd rather do the loan and hope we can pay it back and get the rings back later. Of course, if we can't pay it off, then we'll have gotten substantially less for them than if we sold them. It's not like it matters one way or the other, as this marriage is doomed, anyhow, I'd just like to get as much for them as possible.  You know what's ... irritating/ironic/strange/take your pick? He keeps apologizing for the financial end of things, but not for the lack of affection, attention, thought he gives me. I don't need a lot of money to be happy - I grew up poor, I'll probably continue to be poor, but as long as housing, utilities, food, and some other basics are met, I don't mind the rest too much. (I'm as materialistic as any other Taurus, I suppose, I do want things, but it's usually little things - books, CDs, pens, staplers, paper clips, folders ... yeah, I'm an office supply ho. Staples, Office Depot, and Office Max are bad, bad, evil places. So are kitchen supply stores - utensils, pots, pans, grinders, slicers, knives... Oh, god, what I wouldn't give for an excellent set of kicthen knives. But the good ones are so fucking expensive... Man, out of the boatload of crap in storage, one of the few things that I would miss is my knife sharpener. And my 12 inch skillet. Fortunately the KitchenAid mixer is here with me.)  What I really NEED, and need a LOT of (or at least more than a lot of other people, it seems) are hugs, kisses, strokes, cuddles; being told, being SHOWN, I'm wanted, needed, desired; being paid attention to, listened to, having an interest in me shown. Not being ignored.   That hurts more than anything - being ignored. I've been ignored most of my life, it seems, and I'm so tired of it, especially now, after nearly five-and-a-half years of it from my husband. It's more obvious when you live with somebody who isn't supposed to ignore you, and after long enough of it, you start getting hypersensitive to it in others. I'm now to the point that when somebody starts ignoring me, or I perceive them to be ignoring me, I back off fast and far, and any trust I had in them or confidence I had in myself where they're concerned starts to erode severely.  *sigh*   I hate that. I hate that I am to that point. I hate that I don't know what to DO about it, how to stop being that way. I hate that I'm at a point in my existence where I'm thinking that being alone for the rest of my life, not having a permanent partner in my life, not having any of the affection I crave, would be far better than risking ... any of this again. Maybe after time on my own, that will change. I have to hope that it will.  But back to what I was saying.. The affection, the attention - THOSE are the things I need, the things I've been denied, the things I care about. And he's not sorry for that. He's sorry about the money, the material stuff, the stuff I DON'T need. And that makes me incredibly sad.  We went to the store on Monday, and when we got out of the car, I looked at him, and I thought, "I wish things were different. I really wanted to be happy with him, I loved him SO MUCH ...  " But it's too late now.  There's no going back. Too much time has passed without those things I need, too many times he's gone back on his word ... I could never trust him that way again. And the thought of him touching me ... makes me want to curl up in the corner and hide. Even if I wanted to make the first move, the memories of all the times I tried and got nothing - NOTHING - in return except a strange, far away look, stop me cold.   It shouldn't be this way. I need out.  signed - Me

      The check finally arrived, along with a stack of back claim forms. Though I'm not sure how much good it will do to send them in since the person husband talked to during his interview about the forms said there's still the possibility of being denied for "not following instructiosn".  GAH! But he'll send them in anyhow because if he doesn't he won't get any checks at all if he isn't denied. What a mess, but whatever.  But when he went to deposit, he found out he had $112 in overdrafts. No idea how that happened. He always checked his bank account before going to spend money lately, to be sure that sort of thing wouldn't happen. But at least it wasn't more than that.  So we've got some little bit of money for now, hopefully the rest of the forms will be approved, and we'll be ok for a little while.  Got milk, something for dinner other than Ramen noodles or eggs (canned chili and Chef Boyardee were on sale cheap - $1/can), adhesive to keep the molding on the windshield of the car from flapping around, and the Twinkies I'd been wanting for a month (sometimes the little things make big improvements in your outlook).  Things aren't perfect, they won't be, we're still very unstable financially, and I still want out ... But there's a tiny bit of light, and I'm hoping to get applications put in with the three temp agencies in town, so maybe that will yield something.  signed - Me

      Apparently, somebody was outside doing something (lawn maintenance or the like) and hit the water line. Went to get a part, and that's the last anybody knows. Of course, nobody cared to inform the tenants - we didn't find out until I used the bathroom before fixing dinner and the toilet  didn't refill. And they apparently didn't inform the property management person, or she was playing dumb when Mr.S called.  There's no water in the toilet, and none coming in the pipes - not even from the hot water tank.  So we're completely waterless until ... whenever. And I've got my period. And ate something that is NOT agreeing with my system.   Joy.  And husband's check still is not here, though they claim to have mailed it out on Wednesday.  ::snarksnarkgripegripe:: ::sits down and holds breath until something goes right around here::  signed - Me

      Step 1: Get a job at PG&E (Pacific Gas & Electric) Step 2: Become a supervisor Step 3: When somebody calls in asking if payment arrangements can be altered because the money to pay the $179 they thought they'd be able to afford by the end of the week to keep the power from  being shut off hasn't yet arrived and they've only got $250 to live on until it does arrive, whenever that may be, don't express any sympathy whatsoever and tell them there is nothing that can be done, not even pushing back the date of the payment a week, even though loss of power and gas means they'll go hungry because their food will rot and they won't be able to cook it.  I wonder how that person looks at herself in the mirror each morning. When she goes home from work, does she tell her husband (presuming some poor schlub was dumb enough to marry her), "Guess what happened at work today? Some person called in who was in dire straits and I told them I couldn't help them"? Does she feel at all bad about having to do it? Certainly didn't sound that way on the phone. If I had a job where I had to do that sort of thing, I'd probably hang myself eventually.  Though it's not entirely her fault. I realize she's just going by the PG&E playbook. But the PG&E playbook also offers a few alternatives that she didn't mention - such as the balance payment plan: If it wouldn't do us any good right now, it could've been mentioned as a way of potentially keeping future costs down. Or the CARE program: Again, no immediate help, but if you qualify, it gives a 20% discount on monthly rates. Nor did she mention REACH: A one-time, community assisted payment option for people with a sudden financial hardship, paid by the Salvation Army. Perhaps the tone of my voice put her off - I had two options: somewhat steely, yet calm and rational, or nearly sobbing, and I refuse to do nearly sobbing. However, that should not have stopped her from mentioning any alternatives that are available.   They're called "extenuating circumstances," folks. The IRS is more helpful than these people. Quite frankly, that phone call should be an embarassment to PG&E, and I hope it was recorded. If this is how they operate on a typical basis, the company ought to be ashamed of itself.  signed - Me

      Husband called EDD again this morning, trying to find out about his unemployment check. They said it would be mailed out today, for $400, and that he'll need to send in the rest of his claim forms. But, he only got a couple of forms to begin with, and since  the whole ID mixup and hearing thing occurred, he didn't send them in, so more forms weren't sent, and now he's waiting on an interview to happen to get the rest of them sent.  Our electric/gas bill is overdue. The last mail we got from them was a 48-hour shut off notice. Husband said we'd pay them $179 on Friday. Not sure what we owe, but it's more than that.  The phone bill is also overdue, we owe $90-someodd, but we only need to pay $38 of it. Fortunately, they haven't sent a shut-off notice on that, so we're ok for a while.  We got a notice in our mail - a lien has been placed against our things in storage. We need to pay at least half what is owed ($264, so $132) in order to not have them auction off our things, almost all of what we own. I came to terms with this possiblity some time ago, but it hit husband quite hard.   We have $241. When the check arrives, we'll have $641. Rent's due May 1, and that's $400.  Husband said to me that he never intended things to be this way, and he was very sorry that they were. He said I never should have married him (which has crossed my mind from time to time, but for wholly other reasons.) He asked me if I'd considered going back to Kansas, told me that I should start over. And he cried. The only other times I've seen him cry were during our brief honeymoon week (I forget about what about exactly, but it contained the phrase, "Just give me a chance" - I think I was wanting to go out and do something and he wasn't or we couldn't afford it or ... I forget), and again after his father died. It is exceedingly hard to watch a grown man cry, especially when he's your husband, no matter what else has passed between you.   I can't blame him for the situation we're in, though. It's at least partly my fault - I should've tried harder to find a job and not stopped once he got laid off. It wouldn't have paid much, but it would've helped keep us floating longer. But also, the only ways this point could've been avoided was not to take the Exodus job, and later, not to take the Perot Systems job. But there was no way of knowing when he did, especially with Exodus, that those jobs would go down in such ... spectacular glory. Exodus looked like a good job with a stable foundation. They provided backbone for companies like Yahoo. But their executives made some bad decisions a couple of years after husband started there, and then.. *poof* ..out the company went. The tax problem husband created during that job from exercising/cashing in stock options was and is just background noise. We could've dealt with that had the job not disappeared.   The Perot Systems job was lost because of changes in policy by the Coast Guard saying they'd no longer accept civilians under contract unless they already had security clearances (and how many of THOSE are around? It's not like you can just go apply for clearances at your nearest employment office), that they would no longer wait for clearances to go through as they'd done in the past. Considering the post-9/11 state of things, I suppose that's a fair enough thing to do. But for husband and 11 other people, it wasn't a good thing. And for us, it was particularly bad since we were just getting back on our feet after two years with little or no income. My job making pizzas at the grocery store didn't earn much money, nor did husband's job changing out toner in copiers. Perhaps I should've stayed in Kansas until we knew whether or not things with Perot were more permanently situated. We'd have at least had that meager income and I could possibly have paid rent, though not much else. He'd have been sheltered, albeit without electricity, phone, or heat. I could've tried to find a second job had it come to that (maybe that was something we both should've done, anyhow.) But husband was assured things were fine, going along normally. We thought it would be ok for me to come back. We couldn't have known what was going to happen. He couldn't have known either time.   As much as I want out, I don't want it to be like this. You see, the plan was things would start to improve, slowly but surely. He'd find work,  I'd get a job and start earning money. When the time was right, at some point between him finding a job and me having enough money saved to get out, I would tell him that I wanted a divorce, explain why, and that there was nothing that could be done to change it. He'd be hurt, maybe try to talk me out of it, but ultimately would understand and eventually get over it because in his heart, he wanted out, too. That's how it was supposed to go.  Not like this. Not with him a shattered, tattered, broken man. His pride stripped, sending me away because he "can't take care of me", wracked with guilt for having "failed you", telling me I should start over. Leaving him behind, constantly wondering if he'd wound up on the streets, in a shelter, unable to tell his mother he was ok when I left.   How did things go  so  wrong?

      Written by yours truly, inspired by  urlLink bondage.com :   The Background:  Five couples are at a play party. There are two cops, two cooks, two bankers, two lawyers, and two doctors. The cops are in relationships with the doctors, the cooks with the lawyers, and the two bankers are together. The two  cooks are bottoms, the cops are tops, and each couple has one of each T&B. Tops only play with bottoms, and vice versa. Four of the couples are straight, one homosexual.   The clues:  - James is a cop. He's played with Lauren, but not with Kate or Dale. - Alice is a lawyer. She's played with Bobby & Gene, but not a banker. - Lewis has played with Kate (a banker), and Dale (a cook), but not Lauren or Betty. - Dale has played with Dave, but not a cop. - Gene has played with a cop, but doesn't care for lawyers (they stiffed him in his first divorce :P). - Dave is not in a relationship with Kate.   The questions:  Who is with whom, and who is and what gender are the homosexual couple?   If you think you have the answer, email me at silkenglider at yahoo dot com, or  urlLink contact me via b.com . No prize except for your feeling of accomplishment. Likewise if you wish to borrow or modify it. I mean, I have the handwritten notes. I can prove I did it if you insist on plagiarising, but why do that?  signed - Me

      I did go for a walk yesterday morning. Only did a half circuit since I wasn't feeling well, but I went.   About 30 feet or so before where I turn the corner onto my main path, I started noticing a bunch of slugs. Little inch long, fat, brown ones. Bigger  three-or-so inch long, fat, brown ones. Four-or-so inch long, skinny, light-grey with dark-grey spotted ones. Yech. (I don't salt them. My biologist friend would murder me.)  Further along, I spotted an earthworm that was about eight or nine inches long, about a quarter inch thick in the middle. After that, another worm, shorter and skinnier. I stepped around both of them - they surpass my squish factor for things that are ok to step on.  Also passed two dead birds.  It smelled more lovely out there today than usual. (note the sarcasm)  But I think this exercising-to-lose-weight/inches thing is a bunch of bunk. Since I started, I have GAINED inches around my waist and hips. Honest to god. I know that sometimes you gain weight when/if you start building muscle. But gaining inches?! Never heard such a thing. (I also realize I haven't been at it very long, so I should just be patient, but that really takes the cake. I may burn my tape measures.)   I'm starting to form a theory that the impact from exercise causes the fat to slowly inch its way down your body, eventually leaking out into your shoes. That's why gym shoes smell so bad - not because of sweat, but because of rancid body fat.   So exercisers be careful when you're walking around in bare feet - you could slip and fall from the fat leaking out!  And damn I am hungry. I haven't been getting much uninterrupted sleep lately, so I just kinda get up whenever I wake up, stay up until I'm sleepy again, go back to bed, get up to fix dinner, go back to bed until whenever if I'm still sleepy, or doze at the computer (neck pillows are your friend!)  Yesterday, I got woke up at 1pm or so after about three hours of sleep, laid there trying to go back to sleep for about an hour, couldn't, so I got up and took a shower, got dressed, blow-dried my hair. Around 3:00, husband asks me what's for dinner. I told him "food", then that I wasn't really sure, as we're down to Ramen noodles, oatmeal, a couple boxes of cereal, and some eggs. He sits there for a few minutes, then says, "Did you say we had eggs?" and I said, "Yeah, but I didn't say I was gonna fix 'em." I like eggs, but sometimes, the thought of frying them up or poaching them or something just ... don't wanna do it.  I was contemplating getting up and boiling two or three eggs to put on top of some salad to go with Ramen noodles, when he decided to just go to bed. At 3:15 in the afternoon. Because I didn't yet know for sure what I was going to fix for dinner.   I swear, sometimes, I think he does that sort of thing just to try to make me feel guilty.  Anyhow, I ended up not eating anything myself other than a couple of pieces of toast because I figured it would be rude to fix myself a decent dinner when he didn't have anything to eat (read: the guilt thing worked), even though it was because he's a big whiny baby that went to bed at 3:15 in the afternoon because I didn't know what I was going to fix for dinner yet. (Yeah, I called him a big whiny baby. Probably makes me a bit of a hypocrite. So sue me.)  And the lightbulb in the bathroom has been changed. Hallelujah! I hate using the bathroom in the dark. I hate being in the same room as a mirror when it's dark. Has to do with that  urlLink Bloody Mary  urban legend. That story freaks me the hell out. I also have shower curtain issues because of Stephen King's "The Shining".  BTW - while I was looking up the Bloody Mary link, I saw this about  urlLink camel spiders  on the  urlLink About.com  urbanlegends  urlLink site . EEP!! I don't care if they don't do what the email says! If I saw one of those coming at me, I'd run for the hills!  signed - Me

      My abdomen's feelin' gurgly in a bad way. It can't have been anything I ate - been eating the same sort of meals for three months, and none of it would be ill-making. Will it interfere with my walk? We shall see. I'd hate to get a mile down the road  and suddenly have to use the restroom REALLY badly. I remember when I was a kid, we were going to the fair, and my mom was having ... digestive issues ... We didn't get to the gas station restroom quite in time. No fair for us. Having to walk home in that condition would be about a million times worse than riding home in the car on a plastic bag.  Don't you love it when people share more information than you ever needed to know? I'm sure you could've happily lived out the rest of your life without having read this. My friends don't call me evil for nothin', you know. (Though I'm only minorly evil. Squicking people out, singing annoying songs that get caught in your head, that sort of thing.)  signed - Me

      My uncle and his wife were expecting a baby on the first of April. They had it today. They were going to name her Sarah Marie. Instead, they named him Samuel Dale.  They had completely been expecting a girl, it had said so on the ultra-sounds and everything. They hadn't  picked out any boy's names at all. See what happens when you don't have names for both genders picked?  So, a slightly belated April Fool's prank on them. That boy's going to be a handful, I can tell already. :D  BTW - Boys in this family of cousins are pretty rare. He's the third in nearly 28 years, my brother being the first, then a second one 6.5 years ago that died at 6 mos. Vs. seven girls in that 28 years (me, the one that will be 21 in October, one that will be 15 in September, then ranging down to a seven yo.) Sam's going to be spoiled rotten, methinks.  signed - Me

      Ok. The decision is: Husband *is* eligible for unemployment. Big fat frickin' duh. What was annoying about the call he made on Monday the 5th was that the woman he talked to on Friday the 2nd hadn't been able to get into the file to find out what the decision  was, then acted a bit pissy that he was calling to find out what it was, saying that it had been mailed out on the 2nd. Well, honey, even if it was mailed out shortly after he spoke to you,  HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO TELL HIM ON FRIDAY AND HE OBVIOUSLY HADN'T CHECKED THE MAIL YET WHICH DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE BEEN HERE BY THE TIME HE SPOKE TO YOU AT NOON ON MONDAY, ANYHOW, YOU STUPID BINT!  God forbid he want to know what the fuck the decision is when there's $300 left to live on and he was told it would be made a week ago and it wasn't. Stupid fuckers. As a friend of mine said, "...and THEY have the jobs. Makes ME wonder about the validity of the system."  As to the tax matter...  I asked husband if he had the W2s from the job he'd had the first half of last year, and he said he didn't. And I asked if he at least had the last pay-stub laying 'round somewhere, and he said he didn't. And I said, "Well, then, you'd better call that guy and see what you can find out," and you know what he says to me?  You know what he had the god-damned gall to tell me?!  "I'll just file them without that information."  ARGH! My FREAkin' god!  I told him we have enough tax trouble already without him doing something like that!   What he seems to fail to realize is that THIS AFFECTS ME TOO! So I'll be hounding him on that issue.   As another friend said, "The man is an idiot. That's all."  Before I finally got to sleep yesterday, I was thinking to myself, "If he flat refuses to call and find out the information from that job, it may well be the straw that breaks the camel's back, and I might just ask for a divorce a lot sooner than I'd intended." Which may have only been one of those false bravado thoughts, but ... I dunno. I don't know how much more of his shit I can take. OTOH, I just don't have the money to be able to leave right now. I've got some places in mind to apply to in hopes of remedying that, but I'll need the car to get to them, and (say it with me) I can't drive it yet. At least it's got liability insurance, but that's all. We don't have it registered yet, and may have to get it re-smogged before we can do that. Have to wait and see what the DMV says.  Alright, off that subject for a bit...  I started walking again again this morning. Last week's schedule got thrown off (too tired Monday because of the weekend, only did half my walk on Tuesday because of bad weather, was too busy on Wednesday, then Thursday and Friday ... why do we capitalize days of the weeks? That's irritating ... I said, "Screw it, this week's messed up already anyhow, I'll pick it up on Monday") so I got back into it yesterday. I was whining that I didn't want to because I'd rather have just gone to bed, but I did it anyhow. I find once I'm out the door, I'm not quite so tired. If nothing else, it gets me completely away from husband for an hour a day.  About a quarter mile from the end of the first half, I had the notion to toss in a little bit of jogging. So I picked a fence post, ran to the one after the next, then walked to the one after next, then ran to the one after next, and so on for about half a mile, at which point I wasn't able to do any more running, anyhow (I use that word a lot. What's a good synonym?) Then about a half-mile from the main road, I repeated the pattern for a quarter-mile. Then at the street before the street before our little duplex cluster, I ran to the street before our little duplex cluster.  My left leg muscles are sore long the outside. My lower back is sore. After I went to bed, my body was putting out so much heat that if I got out of bed, I shivered uncontrollably. Plus coughing and wheezing. Then I started to drift off, drifted for about an hour but never got to sleep, then husband made his phone call about unemployment and I wound up being awake until three or four in the afternoon (got up around 8 to fix dinner, then went back to bed until about 1am), though in bed trying to sleep with my body still outputting a lot of heat.   Me no like running!  When I went to bed after dinner, I drifted in and out of sleep, but what finally woke me up was a tickling sensation along my arm. Used to having ants crawling on me on occassion, I looked down to see where exactly it was and found out, hey, that's not an ant, it's one of those  urlLink big ...ish  urlLink spiders  we have hanging around here! I flung it off my arm, but it was still crawling along the comforter. I cupped my hand and swatted it off the bed, flinging it into the wall.  Generally, when it comes to the spiders 'round here, I'm a live and let live kinda gal. I don't go near them, and as long as they don't come near me, we get along fine. I'll sometimes scoop them up with something and fling them outside, but I don't kill them because they cross my squashing threshold (anything big enough I'd be able to hear/feel crunch and squish I don't stomp.) However, when they get within about a foot or so, all bets are off. If hitting the wall killed or injured that spider, I won't feel a bit bad for it.  Well... maybe a little bit bad. But not much.  signed - Me

      The California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board has still not made a decision on my husband's unemployment. They're saying maybe by next week.  When the rent check clears, we'll have approximately $300 left.  So I'm sitting here looking around our apartment, and cataloguing in my mind the things that are down  south in storage, and thinking about what could fit in the car, what things are important enough to take with us. Trying to decide if the things that have emotional ties are more important, or if the things that would be more costly to replace (computer, printer) should take precedent. Perhaps the more expensive gifts from my parents (microwave, mixer, digital camera.) The silverware? The pots and pans that I bought with my high school graduation money? Certainly the graphics I've spent hundreds of hours on would go on a CD to be sure to keep, as would the conversations I've logged with friends. And we'd need room for our IRS papers and other important documents.  My clothes and shoes. Some of those would go along, some of it would be left. I don't wear them all anyhow.   Do I keep the books? They're easy enough to be replaced, but there are so many of them. I want to at least keep my favorites, and my web-programming ones.  The sex toys could be gotten rid of, I guess. I don't use them very often as it is. Keep the clamps and the smaller items. The WAHL massager definitely would be packed.  Of what's in storage ... The quilt my grandmother made us for our wedding. Our wedding albums. Leftover wedding trinkets. Marriage certificate. Small gifts my husband gave me when we still loved each other. These things don't hold much meaning now, but they're a part of my past, and my grandmother spent so much time on the quilt, I'd hate to lose it, if only for her sake.   For my husband's part - some photo albums and childhood trinkets his mother sent us several years ago; he never opened the box, it was something I opened when I was packing things to be put in storage. His late father's dress sword from the service (I forget which he was in). His original birth certificate. Newspaper clippings his mother had saved about him. A few legal papers.  More clothes. More books. My cookbooks. All of the recipes I'd collected over the years. More pots and pans.   The things that wouldn't fit in the car - television, desk, elliptical.  So many things collected in the past six years. A few things from my childhood. Not much of it irreplaceable, but all of it with some emotional attachment. All of it just  things .   And I look around and wonder, can I leave it all behind? Could I? Start over completely from scratch, nothing to my name, things in storage auctioned off to the highest bidder. I'm a Taurus, you know, we're quite materialistic, needing the  things  in order to feel whole.  But when it comes down to it, they're not that important. Take the $300, put the necessities in the car, and drive as far east as we can, hopefully making it to my parents' home before we run out of money. Not that my husband would go for that - I've already mentioned it, so I know. I think he'd sit here and rot before seriously considering losing the  things . Not even to save himself would he do it.   And because I didn't listen when I should have, didn't save myself when I could have, I'll go down with him. For better or for worse - it's what the vows said. I guess I've lived up to them now.  signed - Me

      My husband downloads porn. This does not surprise me or upset me (aside from the fact that, currently, he's spending money we don't have on it) - I happen to enjoy porn and if it's on the computer, I'll watch it (his range is rather limited, though - mostly interracial gangbangs and  hidden cam stuff). He attempts to keep it hidden. This does not surprise me. It does upset me a bit, as it indicates he thinks I am too stupid to find it (which I always do).  What gets me about it are things like today. He went out to pay rent and take bottles to the recycling center. After he left, I got out of bed to use the restroom and give a quick check of messages. He had left everything he'd been doing open on the taskbar, I guess thinking he hadn't woken me while rounding up bottles and would be back before I got up. Among the things left open on the taskbar: the folder in which he stores the porn he tries to hide (and he's gotten a bit better at hiding it - keeps it in the same folder he'd been keeping it in, but he clears off the recent documents listing in the start menu and re-opens any files that had been there so as to make it look like he hasn't been doing anything.)  I shouldn't say it, but I will: If you are trying to hide your porn from your spouse, NEVER EVER EVER leave your folder of porn open on your taskbar! That's being stupid! It doesn't matter if you think they're asleep and you'll be back before they're up, or if they've gone out and you think you'll be out of the bathroom before they get back, or anything else. If they find it while you're up, they may or may not be mad about the porn itself, but they'll likely be irritated they've married an idiot. So for your own sake, when you get up from the computer for any reason, CLOSE YOUR PORN!   Or at least offer to share.  signed - Me

      Well, that fell through. Why am I not surprised? I guess his driving record didn't check out properly or something, though why they didn't figure that out BEFORE having him go down there, I do not know.  So my two weeks alone has been chopped to three days. But it's probably just as well because if it had gone through, he said it sounded like he'd have been gone two months. Not sure I'd have liked that at this time.  But at least it would have been work, income.  ::sigh::  Something has to come up soon, right?  signed - Me

      Maybe brief. Briefish. For me.  Things are kinda looking up at the moment, as much as they can. Husband has a lead on a job - not one he really wants, but it's better than nothing. If it all goes well, it will be fairly steady work for a few years.  If it doesn't go well.. well, it's another bit of debt we'll be in on top of all the rest of it.  Yah... that sounds scammish, doesn't it? But it's not. There's training involved that he has to pay for ... That really doesn't make it sound any better, does it? I mean, if a place is going to hire you and train you, shouldn't  they  be paying for the training? But it's one of those things where they invest a bit in the prospectives, so can't have them coming in just to get the training and then ditching out on the job, ya know? Only way to make sure they get the investment back is to make the training have to be paid for, taking it out of the paycheck a bit at a time. Fair enough, all in all.  Thing is, it means I'll be home alone a bit. I'm not sure how I feel about that. Despite wanting to end my marriage, being home alone a great deal when you're married is different than it is when you're single. That whole "marriage is supposed to have companionship" angle. But so far as companionship goes, we haven't really had that in ages. I dunno. The final nail was hammered in some time ago, this is inconsequential as far as any of that goes. It's just ... ::sigh:: ... I dunno. It's bothersome for some reason.   I think because I know he's considering this because of me - the whole "man as provider" thing. So he's looking to take a job he doesn't really want that he'd be locked into for about three years, making him more or less unavailable to take a job he  would  want, because he wants to provide for his wife. It makes me feel really guilty, because I want OUT and within the next year or so, and he'd be stuck in this job he didn't want but that he took because of me. And I don't understand why he's doing it if that's the reaso, you know? If he cares so much, why the hell doesn't he ...  ever act like it in any other way?   Dammit. What a horrid mess. I wish things were different. So very different. I want my marriage to work, of course I do. But I know it can't. If he started being affectionate, I'd never be able to trust it, not after so long without it. And most days I look at him and feel nothing, or feel contempt, or just pity. ::sigh::  What a mess.  signed - Me

      ::crash::  Argh, god.... So much pain. Worse than losing somebody I was so interested in is having lost a friend.  I tried to look for a bright side, like maybe, now that I'm not distracted by somebody else, maybe I could try again to turn things around with husband. So  I went to bed this morning, crying some from the last conversation I'll probably ever have with the friend I lost, and I slipped my hand into husband's. He was asleep, so he didn't take much notice, and since I was crying, not like I was going to try to wake him.  As I lay there looking at him, I knew .. realized ... knew .. that there was nothing to salvage. I think finally and totally realized it, in that place that had always held out hope. This is what the friend had given me.  I was thinking to myself yesterday that the measure of a good or bad relationship is what you take away from it, what the other person gave you. And I couldn't think of anything that made me any better or worse off for having known K, which saddened me.  But I know now.  As I was thinking this morning that I had been trying to maintain contact with K in the hopes of salvaging what I felt I'd lost with him, knowing now that it is unsalvageable, I saw the parallel with my marriage. I'd seen it in other ways before with the dwindling in both, but this time...  Now I have to figure my way out before I suffocate from it. I could feel it closing in on me today, as I cried for everything I've lost. Uncontrollable, wracking sobs. Ones too strong to keep totally silent. If husband heard them, he never came to check on me. Of course, I don't know what I'd have said if he had - "Yeah, I was really infatuated with this other guy and now that's over and I'm devastated by it, and I want a divorce." Sh'yeah, that'd work.  How do I get out?  And I have to say it, just once - I want K back. I know I can't have him, but that doesn't ... ::sigh:: .. I miss him. Or rather, what I got from him at one time - feeling wanted, cared about, desired. The allowance of expression of all that I have to hold in. I don't know if I'll ever feel that way with anybody again. It's hard to see it, hard to believe it will ever happen. I know it wasn't real, but the spots in my brain that process the good feelings a hug or a kiss or a touch bring about didn't know that.  I feel like my body is caving in. Like my soul is withering, pulling away from the tissues of my body, curling up to hide.  Why can't I stop crying?  I want to run, but there's nowhere to run to, nobody to run to. I want to be held and stroked and cuddled and there's nobody there, and I'll tell you something, hugging yourself isn't the same. Trying to curl into the corner of the shower stall for cuddling isn't the same.  Need to whimper, need to scream, need to run.  This is how heartbreak feels.  signed - Me

      ::sigh::  I am a fool. I knew but couldn't see. Didn't think. Didn't figure.  I  knew  he was in love with somebody, but had thought it was somebody he couldn't have, didn't want him, was in his past. Something like that.  And I  knew  that there couldn't be anything between us , not really, but I'd always thought ...  maybe  ... maybe someday ... we could at least  meet , get together, have some fun. Nothing permanent. Never that.  Then I found out. They'd made up. Will be living together. Him and her. He and she. And I think to myself, "I should be happy for him" ... since there was nothing there. Could never be.  But I can't. He let me think he wanted me, too. Let me think he cared. Never told me she was still around. That I was just somebody to fill the time. Rebound girl.  But I knew.  Should've seen.  Didn't.  Never again.  singed - Me

      Ok, so I'm one of those people that can't take advice or leave well enough alone.   Conversation II:     me (4:15:10 AM): hey him (4:19:05 AM): hi me (4:19:23 AM): how're things? him (4:20:58 AM): good him (4:21:00 AM): you? me (4:21:11 AM): so-so him (4:22:00 AM): yeah? me (4:23:02 AM): mm... ok... i need to ask something, and need you to be 100% honest, and then i'll just shut up about it. him (4:23:10 AM): sure me (4:23:49 AM): the other night, were you just being nice to spare my feelings, or do you want to stay in contact? him (4:24:23 AM): I do me (4:24:31 AM): ok.  him (4:24:55 AM): alright    So now, I will just shut up about it - to him - and see how things go.  In other news...  Husband is in pain and walking funny. Possibly prostatitis, possibly a hernia, possibly something else entirely. But it's not like we can go to a doctor and find out (no free clinic in these parts), and it's not emergency-room-visit level yet. He says it has happened before, so I'm trying to not worry, however...  One, he had an interview last week, one of those where there are also at least a dozen other interviewees and then they choose three to come back. These generally don't go well for husband, but if he were chosen, and if the interview had to be before this has gone away, that wouldn't be good.  And two - we need groceries. Maybe not  need  need, as we've got chili, at least 15 pounds of potatoes, two dozen eggs, ramen noodles, a couple of tomatos, 3/4ths of a head of lettuce, and some frozen chicken drumsticks... I think I'll do up a bit of salad for dinner tonight. But we're low on milk, almost out of bread, down to about a gallon of water, and I need carrots, celery, and onions if I'm going to make a batch of potato soup. And I can't drive to get them. Car's a stick shift. I can drive it some, but can't make it go on hills, and there are stoplights on hills between me and the grocery store. Plus, the car ain't registered. So it's just a bad idea.

      And then he contacted me.  God, I'm confused.   I don't want to end it, obviously, but I don't know where things are going or will go or if they'll get better and as much as I like roller coasters, emotional ones aren't nearly as much fun.   We'll see what happens.  That he contacted me is a good sign, I guess. But he didn't contact me with a, "No, no, this doesn't have to be it, I want to keep talking to you."   Here, this is what it was:    him (9:54:54 PM): it's not indifference dear, but I understand what you're saying me (9:55:06 PM): then what is it? him (9:55:23 PM): I don't know, sometimes people just run outo f things to say to each other I guess me (9:55:57 PM): yeah. so .. goodbye, then? him (9:56:29 PM): I guess, I'm sorry me (9:57:19 PM): i .. i ... i am, too ...  him (9:58:34 PM): you're a sweetie [silkenglider], I don't know what happened me (9:59:32 PM): i don't,either. i wish it could be fixed, because i really like you. but i won't force it, either him (10:00:28 PM): you don't have to delete me if you don't want to me (10:00:35 PM): i don't him (10:00:47 PM): then don't me (10:00:51 PM): ok him (10:01:42 PM): alright    Then some other bit of chat.  It's not quite definitive, is it? But better than not hearing back. I just wish I  knew ... And as you can see, I was the lead on the "don't want it to end," bit, not him, and past experience tells me that's never so great.  Shit. I should've just left it with goodbye. Ah well.  signed - Me

      I finally semi-broke things off with the friend from the last entry. Sent an email that read:     K -  This is the last time I'm going to contact you. It's more a matter of self-preservation than anything else. If I thought things were going to change, I'd keep trying, but ... It doesn't seem like they will, and the indifference hurts.  So, unless I hear from you, I guess this is goodbye.  Take care, ok?  - B    I know I'll not hear back.  It really hurts. I know I'll recover, but I wish it had been different.  I liked him so much. But I can't handle it anymore, being ignored, one word answers, the indifference. And now the knowledge that I don't have an outlet for the things he was an outlet for, and won't for some time, because like I said last time, he's the last person I'm getting that close to for a long, long while.  I would've wished him a happy birthday, except for two things: would've been tacky, and he hadn't wanted me to know when it was for some reason. (Though ... I had guessed. I was kinda freaked that I had guessed  right , but I had guessed.)  I hope it was.  Happy birthday, K.  signed - Me

      I had a friend.  Things were going well, then things dropped off, then things went well, and now things have dropped off again, and it's not looking like things will improve this time.  The person had gradually been getting less and less responsive. One day I asked, "You don't particularly  want to talk to me anymore, do you?" and he said, "I do," and I asked, "Would you tell me if you didn't?" and he said, "Yes."  But, the way things had been going, I didn't quite believe that.  About a week later, I said, "I figure I've got three options where you're concerned. 1) Keep on as I have been, saying hello whenever the mood strikes, 2) take a don't speak until spoken to attitude, or 3) give up," and he said, "The first."  So, I did the first, but as had been happening, I barely got any response.  Now, at this point I had been thinking for several months, "It's the pattern again, it's the pattern AGAIN." The pattern being that I'll meet somebody, say, my husband, and things will be really good for three or four months, but then that all will just stop. Sometimes a bit gradually, but in a sudden way, like, gradually over two or three weeks as opposed to gradually over, say, 20 years where you wake up one morning and realize it's all gone to pot and you're 40- or 50-something and about to divorce the person you've been married to for 20 or 30 years and try to start your life over again in your middle age.  But the pattern goes like this: Good, good, good, something changes but I'm never sure what, kinda good, kinda good, something else changes and again not sure what, slipping, slipping, slipping... gone. Within the space of three to four months, as I said. Happened with my marriage, happened with first boyfriend (kinda, not really, he was just a jerk that didn't have the guts to tell me he'd dumped me for two weeks), happened with a man I subbed to for a while, and now with this guy.  We'd started talking in January, by March I was seeing the signs (had gone from saying "hi" every time he saw me on, to "hi" only in the morning, to "hi" only on the weekend, to "hi" never and I was having to start the majority of conversations, and when I asked him why he hadn't said hello in a while, he said he just never looked to see who was on anymore, and he'd always seemed to be honest and straightforward before so I believed that, though I don't know that I do any longer), by April thinking, "By the end of June, we won't be talking at all anymore," and by the time the beginning of May rolled around I was starting to know I was right.   I tried to prevent it, saying hello, trying not to be clingy (difficult for me to do, but I tried), trying to be calm, cool, "hey, how ya doin'", not trying to force conversation (which resulted in many four sentence convos), and more or less to not be whatever it is that seems to drive people off.  Of course, I didn't succeed.  Around about the last week of May - the 25th to be exact - I flipped. The person's online indicator never showed idle that night (which it usually does if he's off doing something), and I didn't get any response to any messages I sent, and as that wasn't the first time, I felt very ignored, very hurt, very angry, feelings that had been building for a while, and I sent a note that, while it wasn't insulting, was quite obvious that I was hurt and angry. In fact, I'll reproduce it for you here:     If you've taken me off your messenger list, fine, but I'd appreciate being told so.  If not, then I'd appreciate a "not right now" or some such rather than being ignored. I get more than enough of that elsewhere. Frankly, coming from you, who has claimed ...  Dammit. You know what? You frustrate the hell out of me. If I were there, I'd smack you around the head until you straighted up and flew right. Christ on a fucking god-damn crutch.  Knock it off and be freaking consistant, will ya? I don't mean never have a bad day or not want to talk or whatever, but stop being so damn ... ARGH!  I like you - I like you a lot. And I care about you. And with that whole boy/girl thing, if things were vastly different for me... well, I wouldn't mind finding out how you are in that arena.  But you drive me INSANE sometimes, and at the moment I'm hurt and angry and lashing out.  Damn.  You know what else? It doesn't help that you never tell me anything. Like I'm not good enough to be an actual friend or something. Heaven forbid I should know what's going on in that thick-skulled head of yours or have a real conversation with you every once in a while. "No, no.. I like you, I want to talk to you, but I'm not going to tell you anything ever because you wouldn't understand." Yeah, a fine commentary on what you think of me.  What I can't figure is why you even bother to acknowledge me when it's about as clear as can be that you have no interest. Why don't you tell me to go away? I've even straight out asked you if I should go away and you've said no. And I don't get it, especially at times like this when you blatantly ignore me.  *sigh*  I just ... am confused, and hurt, and ...  there's no typy thingy ... um ... typy lettery thingamabobby dealy ... representationy ... THING ... for a frustrated, bone-deep, lost-sounding moan. Ya know, like with "argh"? Not one of those for what I'm feeling at the moment.  Anyhow. No good way to close this out. I'm not even sure why this matters to me, why I am upset by it, except that ... people I like are few and far between. *shrug*  I think I should get some sleep.  -B    Yeah. I know.   The next morning he said he hadn't been on, that he'd left the computer on and gone to watch a game on television. I apologized then (only a couple of sorries as I was feeling too stupid to say much else), and the next morning apologized as best as I knew how and as sincerely as I could and very much meant it, and he seemed to accept it and didn't tell me to go to hell which he totally would've been justified in doing. The net result being he STILL did not tell me he didn't want to talk to me any longer, but still did not respond to much of what I said in the few short chats we had over the next few days.  June second, we had a brief conversation that left me feeling like he really did not care anymore - he was about as responsive to what I said as my husband had been the last few times I ever hugged him, which is to say, just going through the motions, except my husband never hugged back - and then I didn't say hello again for just over two weeks. That conversation then was short, very stilted, and I don't know if there will be another one.   And it hurts so much.  And I don't understand what started to go wrong, or why he never just said he didn't want to talk anymore when it was so very obvious. It was like watching my marriage die all over again, but worse because this time I saw it happening, I knew what was happening, and there was still nothing I could do to  stop it, and it's NOT FAIR! It's not fair. I liked him so much, and I couldn't stop being insecure because he said he liked me and I didn't want him to not and I tried so hard not to let it show and failed and now I've lost another person that meant something to me because I'm not enough .. I'll never be enough for anybody.  And now the biggest reason I don't want to let it go is because I made the decision when I saw it starting to die that he was the last that I'd let myself get that close to, the last I'd let myself feel anything for until I can be enough for somebody, and that's going to be a very long time. I don't want to be alone, but I have no choice - I am alone.  signed - Me

      I see myself standing on the edge - the edge of a giant pit, the opening of a large, active volcano.  I see that I am turned away, looking out over the ocean. I see other islands, farther away. Feel the volcano rumbling beneath my feet, knowing it will soon burst forth, the lava swallowing me up.  I should leave for the other islands, try to get to safety. But I know it's no use, that I won't reach even the sands of this one before the lava comes.  I feel the heat. I stand and wait.  signed - Me

      Criminy. This has GOT to be the longest month EVER. Prior to this, when I was doing nothing, the days, weeks, and months just zipped on past. Now there are actual days, and they're so long, and they're making this month just drag on and on and on...  Not that I want it to be August. I have to call the IRS again on the 9th. Before the 9th, actually, because I'm working on the 9th, and I don't wanna do it! They're going to tell me we have to pay them now that we both have jobs and stuff.   ::whine::  Make it be next May already!   signed - Me

      I post a " urlLink manifesto " and suddenly my life turns around. Kinda sorta.    You won't believe this, but about a week after I got a job, my husband also got a job. Yesterday, as a matter of fact, so exactly a week after. He starts on Monday. Another copier shop job,  but it pays nearly twice as much as the last one and this place provides the transportation he'll need for getting around the area he'll be responsible for, which the last place didn't do. The last copier place he had to use our car to get around and to haul stuff and we're lucky he didn't get toner all over it since we had to sell it back in January. If it had been coated on the inside with toner, I don't think we'd've gotten as much as we did.    I'd told him that as soon as I found something, he would, too. That's how the pattern has worked. I look for a job, he gets a job (a better one than he'd been at, back in 1999), I look for a job, he loses a job (getting bored with housewifery, the company he's at collapses, 2001), I look for a job, he gets a job (me in Kansas, him in Cali, 2002), I look for a job, he loses a job (California, November 2003).     ... Ya know, those two times I was looking and he lost, a bunch of other people also lost theirs. And L lost his job about a week after husband lost his job in November... Oops! ...     Anyhow.    We were in a find cycle this time. It does make me wonder what shoe is about to drop, however, as it seems nothing good happens to us lately without also being quickly followed by something bad. But hopefully this will hold for a while. If we're both working, it will make it that much easier for me to save up.     Although... I'm starting to stress about when and how I'm going to tell husband I want a divorce. He's mentioned it himself a couple of times before, but at times when it could've just been stress talking (while I was in Kansas and having trouble with some tax related stuff, and again this past spring when we were having such trouble with his unemployment), and hasn't ever talked about it beyond those two incidents. I don't want to hurt him, I think I still love him some, though I've said otherwise before. But staying hurts me, and I think in the long run leaving would be best for both of us. Or so I hope. I know it would be good for me, I don't know if it would be good for him.     ::sigh::    I can't worry about him. I can't. I know I can't. If I do, I might not find it in me to go, and I have to. But it's so damn hard not to worry. I can't stand to think of him alone, somehow. I know he can take care of himself, he's done it before. But he's getting older... and I'll always wonder what he's doing, if he's ok, if he's alive. I'll wonder because there won't be any reason for us to stay in contact after I'm gone. We don't have kids, I wouldn't take alimony, we don't have to live in the same town or work together. I'm his third wife and he has no contact with the other two (first was anulled, second a divorce), so I know there will be none with me. That in itself doesn't sadden me.     What saddens me is that there's nothing there. Not even anything that would be, "Hey, keep in touch, let me know how you are," ya know? Almost like - other than an accumulation of things, bad credit, and a few memories - it never happened.  That  saddens me deeply. There aren't even that many memories because we so rarely do anything memorable, and some of the memories I do have, I'd rather not remember.    There is the tax thing, I suppose, but now that we're both working and here, we'll probably finally get to a tax lawyer to see if anything can be done, and one day there won't even be that connection.    Ya know, I remember our wedding day, how very happy I was. I was marrying somebody I loved so much and who loved me back, who I was going to share a life with, maybe have a family with, and even though I knew there'd be ups and downs, I thought we'd get through them. But here I sit, six years and a couple of months later, and there's nothing. Nothing. Remembering the happiness of that day, the look in his eyes that day that said he was happy, too... only makes me cry.     Do you know how it feels ... To have things turn around in your life, have things happen that you are excited about, happy about, and the person you should be able to turn to and share that excitement and happiness with is so distant from you that it's not possible?     When I got the job offer, he was happy and relieved, but was there a hug, a kiss? The second day I worked, my feet were so horribly sore I was walking around our apartment on my knees after I got home, and as he went to get on the computer, I waylaid him for a hug. He kinda patted my shoulder and waited for me to finish and go away. That's the sort of reaction that made me stop hugging him in the first place. I remember one time when we were in Santa Clara, while things were still good with work and money, and I gave him a hug and he just stood there. Didn't put his arms around me or anything. I think that's when I really started to know how things would eventually end up.    I know there are people around me that care, that are happy and excited for me, but it's not ... it's not the  same  as having somebody you love in  that  way to share with. And maybe not even love, but at least like a whole, whole lot in  that  way.     Yes, I want celebratory hugging, kissing, and sex, dammit!     I mean, yeah, hugging and jumping around with a close friend (of which I have none nearby, so I may have to content myself with gleeful spinning around) would be good, too, but it's not the  same . There's no cuddling with friends. At least not in my world. Maybe in  your  world you cuddle with friends, but to me, that just seems wrong. For me, cuddling is reserved for lovers and small children (two very different sorts of cuddling, btw). And a comforting hug is not the same as a cuddle, IMO.     Oonyhoo...    Husband has a job. Good, good, good thing. (And I at least kissed him on the top of his head. The one on his shoulders, I mean.)    signed - Me

      ..."I have a new job for thee..."    Ok, so it's day 287 or whatever, but on day 291 (last Tuesday, the 13th) (Oh, hey! I consider 13 my lucky number and I was wearing my lucky interview shirt - the one I was wearing the day I got the job offer  at Hy-Vee. No wonder I got the job. ;), just five short days after posting my " urlLink manifesto ", I had a job. Things kinda went like this:    Friday - Post manifesto  Monday - Put in nine job applications  Tuesday morning - Get two calls about two potential jobs and set up one interview  Tuesday afternoon - Have interview  Tuesday evening - Get job offer from interview, accept, go out for celebratory dinner  Wednesday night - Start job    Considering the number of apps (somewhere around 30) I put in when I first was job hunting out here back in September/October and only hearing back from one of those and not getting a job, I have to say I was flabbergasted I got one so quickly this time. For once, the Universe has ponied up instead of pulling the rug out, and it's about time. If husband gets a job soon, too, so much the better, because while I'm working 40 hours, it's at $7/hour, which isn't much, especially when you have to pay rent, utilities, groceries, and laundry out of it and still need to be able to save up for other reasons and will likely have a large chunk of it taken out by the gov't for past taxes due.    But, it's a start.    I'm working in the bakery of a restaurant. It's a three-person department, a lot of assembly (all of it from frozen stuff and mixes and cans), and setting out food for a buffet line. It's kind of a mix of my last two jobs, so once I have the routine down, it shouldn't be  too  bad. I hope. There's a  lot  of stuff to do. I mean, a   lot  . Almost a ridiculous amount considering that except on Fridays and Saturdays, it's one person per shift. Fridays and Saturdays there's a mid-day shift (which is mine) that bridges the morning and evening workers to ease things on them for the two busiest days, but the rest of the time, just the one, near as I can figure.    My hours are kind of all over the place, with one late shift backed by an early shift, which sucks, and only one day off per week, which also sucks, but I suppose I'll get used to it. It will be better once my feet stop feeling like they would kill me if they were able to move independently of my body.    When my second day of work ended, I said to husband (who drops me off and picks me up), "I have  got    to get a new pair of shoes before tomorrow . " I'd had a pair that I'd bought for interviews that had next to no cushion in them and no room for both sets of arch supports that I need, and I was doing the equivalent of standing on concrete in bare feet for six and 7.5 hours those first two days. When I got off work the second day, I could barely walk, yet I went all over the mall trying to find a decent pair of workboots. I'd rather have sat and cried or puked and passed out from the pain in my feet and legs.     Ended up with a pair of Stanley (the tool people) brand boots from Payless for $30. Slip-resistant, steel-toed, pretty sturdy. But my arch supports had broken down quite a bit so my feet still were killing me. I got two new sets and hope those will help, and I can put the old ones in in addition if needed. I need some cushioning around the toes, too, I think, but am thinking the pain in my toes is at least partially due to the arch support issues, and if those clear up, maybe so will the pain in my toes ... and knees ... hips ... back ...    I remember when I started at Hy-Vee I had the same issues and getting the supports in helped tremendously. I don't know, though, if they ever really stopped hurting, or if I just got used to it. Maybe some of both.     I mean, yeah, some soreness is to be expected when you're standing on your feet all day, especially when you're overweight, but I'm talking near crippling foot pain. And I weigh nearly 30 pounds less now than I did when I started at Hy-Vee and this is just as bad as that was. I'm trying to remember if I ever experienced this when I was at Holiday Inn, when I was another 20 or 30 pounds lighter than I am now and can't remember if I did or not.    Oh yeah. The post from a week or two ago when I said I was down to 249lbs is wrong.    I'm down to 244. I guess I didn't stand still enough on the scale that day, but I've checked three times since then to be sure and 244(.4 - exact scale) it is. And that's clothed with light shoes on, so subtract a pound or two. I haven't weighed this little in over five years, so I am quite pleased, and with a somewhat active job again, I hope I'll continue to lose. Though hopefully not fast enough that I'll have to buy a new wardrobe soon because I won't be able to afford that for a while.   I was amused (and slightly flattered) that the shirt they gave me on my first day - the new, never before worn shirt - was only a large. Even if I weren't larger than large through the stomach, there  are  the breasts to consider. So I asked the guy they turned me over to if I could get something just a wee bit larger, and he brought me two used shirts, one of which still smelled like men's deoderant. Ew!     But I have two shirts instead of just the one which is really good since I'll only be able to do laundry maybe once a week and need to be able to rotate them. Wish I could do it more often because I am sweating up a storm there, but it's $3.50/load to wash and dry, and I have to go to Fortuna for it since the laundromat here closed, and my hours just aren't conducive to me wanting to be awake long enough to go do laundry and come home and fix dinner (even if I'm just heating stuff in the microwave), and maybe grab half-an-hour of computer time and take a shower before hitting the sack. Really, the only days that would be good for laundry are Sunday and Thursday (Sundays will be night shifts, Thursdays off), but if I do laundry on Thursday, I won't need to come Sunday, and if I do it on Sunday, I'll need to by Thursday. Of course, if husband gets a job, then Thursdays will probably be out, too, unless I take the bus to Fortuna, but I really don't want to be carrying a sack of laundry from the bus stop to the launderette and back.    I miss having my own washer and dryer.    But as it works out, I'll wear each shirt three times and each pair of pants twice (have three pairs), and hope I don't get any of them super dirty before laundry day. I suppose I could try hand-washing and hope they dry out in between wearings...     Grocery shopping's going to be kind of a pain now, too. We can do it in Eureka, there's a grocery store very close by my place of employ, I just prefer the stores in Fortuna. I know the stores in Fortuna, they're laid out well, and everything is easy to find. The ones in Eureka are laid out all wrong and backwards from the others, and the Eureka Safeway is squished, not to mention out of the way. The end result is that it takes me twice as long to do my grocery shopping in Eureka as it does in Fortuna.   What's annoying me, too, is that my body doesn't want to co-operate on the sleep thing. When I don't need to go to sleep right away - like last night since I don't have to be to work until 4pm today - *BAM* out like a light. But on the nights I  do  need to be to sleep ASAP, I toss and turn and toss and turn and it takes me at least an hour to get to sleep, then husband comes to bed and wakes me up in the process and I spend another 15 to 30 minutes getting back to sleep. I hope this won't be an ongoing problem and it's just the newness of it all, but it's going to be irritating while it lasts.    Oh no.    I just had a horrifying thought.    If I'm going to be off on Thursdays ...    Lemme see ... The schedule I had for this week, I worked Wednesday 4-10:30, Friday 11-6, Saturday 10-6, tonight 4-10:30, off tomorrow, 8-4 Tuesday, and 8-2 Wednesday. I hope I have this coming Thursday off. Surely I will. They wouldn't make me do T,W,Th,F,S,S,M,T,W ... Pay schedule ends on Wednesdays... No, that'd be nine days in a row, and ... Yeah, surely I'll have this coming Thursday off if that's going to be my regular day off.    Man, one day off per week. That's gonna suck. And midweek, too. I can forget about me and husband going out to do anything ever again. I mean,  ever  again. If I leave in May, and this is my schedule until then, then we will literally probably never have the chance to do anything leisurelike together again, especially once he gets a job and won't have Thursdays free.    Wow. That really makes me sad. We have our problems, but going out and doing stuff every once in a while, little often though that is, is nice enough. Probably the few times we ever interact or anything and enjoy each other's company a little bit.     ::sigh::    Anyhow ... I have a job.    signed - Me

      Alright, I found this to be way too funny.  I ran a search on "incubus sex" and came up with an  urlLink article  from  urlLink About.com . Towards the bottom of the article is this:    On this website, a female evangelist is quoted as saying, “I know there are countless women that this [demons sexually abusing them] is happening to, because every Christian woman I have spoken to about it [sex demons], 9 out of 10 it has happened to.” Nine out of 10 seems pretty high,  but it’s difficult to know what a fundamentalist might consider sexual abuse.     *snork!*  I shouldn't laugh at that, I know I shouldn't, but it really gave me the giggles.  signed - Me

      Last year for my birthday (the one in 2003, not 2004... Or maybe it was Christmas 2002? One or the other. Let's go with birthday), my husband gave me a little Boyds bear.  I pulled it out of the suitcase I'd had it in since last August and was sitting  it up on a shelf when I noticed that one leg was longer than the other, and I jokingly said,  "Ahhh... Poor little bear has Polio or whatever it is that makes you need the special shoes to correct the leg length," then "..and it's hips are out of whack. Poor thing needs surgery," and none of it in a serious tone or anythihng.  Well.. this made husband start to tear up. Guess it hurt his feelings or something. I put the bear on the shelf and went into the bedroom and was saying to myself, "No. No, don't you DARE try to make me feel guilty or act like it's because you still love me. Don't you DARE! Not when you haven't touched me or hugged me or kissed me or anything in over four years and don't ever even say 'I love you'." And on and on in that vein in my head.  Telling him I want a divorce should be tons of fun when it rolls around. I'd considered the 148 day (halfway) mark, but as it turns out, that's December 4th, smack between Thanksgiving and Christmas/New Year's, and that'd really ruin those. So I'm thinking I'll hold off about a month and tell him at the beginning of January, if things are all going well enough that I'll be able to carry through.  Please,  please  let them be going well enough. I have GOT to get out of here.  signed - Me  PS - Another cathartic song from the past few days: from  urlLink Justin Hayward's  " urlLink The View From the Hill " -  urlLink  Something to Believe In

      I have one sure way to induce it for myself.  Whenever there is something going on in my life that I need a release of some sort from, I take a random  urlLink Moody Blues  CD, pop it in the player, and listen. There's almost always a song that is applicable and  will get me crying. I honestly think they've saved my life a time or two when I was so far down in the dumps I didn't think I'd find a way out or particularly want to.  Jimmy Buffet will also work sometimes, but it's not as random. I have to pick out certain CDs or I'll end up with a bunch of party music. Which isn't bad, but not the effect I'm going for. John Denver also sometimes, but I prefer the Moodies.  In general, their music has a vibe to it that hits me deep in the psyche and I've always felt able to connect to that which is beyond me through it, an effect I don't get from Jimmy or John. When I have the means and privacy, I will often put in Moodies music, put on headphones, turn up the volume as high as I can stand, and lay with my eyes closed, listening and letting it flow through me. What's also very cool is that with some songs, there are instruments, beats, and melodies going from one side of the headphones to the other (on a stereo, surround/sound sort of setup) and following the sounds between them is kinda fun.  The cathartic song for me the past couple of days is  urlLink  Talking Out of Turn  , from the  urlLink Long Distance Voyager  album. It applies somewhat to K (substituting "friendship" for "love") and somewhat to my husband and certainly applies to how I'm feeling. I think  urlLink  In My World   may also work once I sit and listen, but it doesn't have the cross-the-board applicability or soul-stirring harmonies of Talking.  Side note: I was sad to find out Ray Thomas had retired from the band. I guess his arthritis and gout finally got to be too much for him, and something about having planned to leave at 60 anyhow. He was my favorite member and I'll miss his voice and amazing flute playing.  signed - Me

      That's how long I'm giving myself.   296 days to find a job, save the money, tell the husband, tell the family, pack my stuff, quit the job, rent a truck, and get the heck out of Dodge... As it were.  BTW, 296 days translates out to the first of May, 2005.   See, I'd told myself that I'd give myself one year from the day I got back from Kansas to work things out, and things haven't worked out. I knew the night I got back they weren't going to work out, I've known every day since I got back that they weren't going to work out, and I haven't particularly tried to work things out because  I ... don't ...  want to!    Especially now.  And I have all these feelings going on inside - happiness in a very small quantity; sadness in a very large quantity; trepidation, fear, confusion ... Grief. Still that uncaringness of what happens. A small, burning ember of determination, followed by a longing to be able to give up; a certain sense of hatred and loathing, both for myself and a few others.   Loneliness.   It's all combining into this feeling that starts in my gut, spreads up through my chest, then spills down my arms and back. Something akin to desperation, and a feeling of being trapped, pressed in on, compressed ... while at the same time thinking I could explode. I want to curl up in a ball and hide under my bedcovers and never, ever come out ... And at the same time I want to skip and jump and run with my arms spread wide and a smile on my face.  I want to scream and cry and laugh and sing all at once.   I want to be in love. I want to be in like. I want to be in neutral. I want to get rid of all the negative feelings, all the hatred, all the fear, all the loneliness and just be me. The happy me. The confident me. The me I hear inside my head and feel inside my heart but am too scared to let out because I don't want to be rejected.  The woman sitting at the computer typing this out ... She isn't me. She's not who I wanted to be. She cries a lot, sleeps a lot, is sad a lot. She's too afraid of what people can do to her to get close, but terrified of being alone. She won't stand up for herself, say that she deserves better, that she won't be ignored anymore.   She hides me. She won't let me out because she doesn't want to be hurt anymore, and I am not afraid. She doesn't know how not to be afraid.  Yet I said that I feel fear. I, who have just said that I am not afraid, I feel fear. And the thing that I fear is this:  That she will win.   That her fear will win.   And that in 296 days, I still won't be free.  signed - Me

      One other thing before I forget.  In regards to K (yeah, yeah)...  I don't want to make it seem that he deliberately led me on. That was not the case at all. True, he didn't actively discourage my getting attached, but I also think he didn't  expect  me to get  attached, or as attached as I did, and may not have ever realized that I had or to what extent, even after I kinda  urlLink bunny-boilered  on him last chat (I come to that conclusion because he didn't understand why I was upset at not knowing, and not in the bad kind of way).   Not exactly like I was going to say, "But.. but.. I have the major hots for you and now those hopes are all gone and I'm sad because I won't get to shag you." Or whatever. My feelings went slightly deeper than that, but considering I had no thoughts beyond that to any sort of permanent relationship, that's really what it comes down to. And I did kinda say that when I apologized for .. uh .. Not for being upset, but for being less than gracious about it.  Ok, as per usual, the convo (insert wavy flashback music  here ):    (June 29th, via offline messages)   me (6:54:16 AM): why didn't you tell me? him (3:27:20 PM): tell you what?   (June 30th)   me (4:24:11 AM): about your girlfriend him (4:30:08 AM): you didn't ask me (4:30:39 AM): i didn't *know*. you never told me anything.  him (4:31:42 AM): we didn't talk often enough me (4:31:53 AM): we've beent alking for six months! him (4:32:39 AM): I didn't say long, I said often me (4:33:12 AM): and at some point you couldn't have slipped it in... ?  him (4:33:51 AM): could've me (4:33:58 AM): then why didn't you? him (4:34:20 AM): wasn't an issue at the time me (4:35:12 AM): yeah... him (4:35:37 AM): and what are you getting so pissed off about me (4:36:08 AM): because knowing would've saved me a lot of stress  [note: hedging]  him (4:36:21 AM): what stress me (4:37:26 AM): things had seemed to be going fine, then you pretty much shut up and I was wondering what the hell i'd done wrong. again.  [note: still hedging. and the "again" is referring to past relationships]  him (4:37:57 AM): that had nothing to do with the girlfriend, she came along after me (4:38:12 AM): i see him (4:38:41 AM): meh, whatever, I'm off, later  [note: see, I'd have told me to go to hell]    me (6:19:07 AM): i'm sorry i was pissy. look, I'm happy for you, really I am. I know you wouldn't be all lovey dovey in your profile if you didn't love her, so - yay for you. :) .. I was just shocked, is all. Sucker punch to the solar plexis shocked. I was trying to maintain contact with you under .. a misguided assumption. And I'm feeling sorry for myself because the outlet I had for affection - you - I don't have for an outlet anymore. I'd hoped that would change, but.. Guess it won't. :) .. And I'll get over that. In like, a week or so. Trust me, the grandest idea I ever had about you was a week in a motel room. :P .. Ahhh, K ... ::hugs:: ... I envy her some. I envy you. Your life is laid out there with a lot of promise. I know you'll do well. As for me ... i'll be around, i guess. be good. ::hugs::     Besides, even if she hadn't been there, as it were, what, was I going to ask him to not have a girlfriend ever? Be loyal and faithful to a married woman who lives 900 miles away and for whom the chances of ever meeting are slim to none, no matter what fantasies I'd drawn up in my head? Kinda don't think so.  It's been over a week, and I'm not totally over it, but I'm doing good. I haven't sobbed over it in a couple of days, though I've had a couple of brief tearing ups. But they were very brief.  Besides, good has come of it. If it weren't for all of this ... ::waving hand airily:: ... I think I'd be content to keep sitting and waiting for something to change. Instead, I've realized that the things I want aren't going to come to me if I sit and wait, even if I'm waiting for a signal to do something.   I think this was that signal.  So no matter what else I've babbled about in the past week or three, or that I will probably babble about in the coming weeks, instead of feeling sorry for me, feel happy for me. I'm starting to reach again.  signed - Me

      I find it cool and amusing that this blog is now coming up in 'net searches.  Cool search: via  urlLink Yahoo.com  for "exorcising your demons" (I'm at spot 31 as of the time of this writing [1:12am, July 8, 2004]) Cool because I came up, and because somebody thought the associated blurb  was interesting enough to make them click, even if they didn't stay long enough to read.  Amusing search: via  urlLink Technorati  for "blowjob", which gave the searcher the post " urlLink New month, new beginning? ", and of course, now this post would hit it, too.   I find it amusing, though, because you have to figure anybody searching the blogs listed on  urlLink Technorati  for "blowjob" are a bunch of cocks and pussies looking for sluts and whores and wank material (oh, look - I said cock and pussy and slut and whore and now people will land here from those, too .. ::snicker:: If I added "cunt" and "sex" to the mix, we'd be all set. Which I just did, and no need to add "fuck" as I've probably said that a million times already), and it only netted the guy/gal a brief mention of a short-term affair I had that didn't have any juicy details at all.   In other news...  Job searching. I hate it. Working I don't mind .. much. Staying at home doing a lot of nothing I don't mind .. much. Hunting for a job - hate it. Most people probably do, I imagine. There's just so much rejection involved.  But I'm on the list of associates for the  urlLink Express Personnel  office in the area, and also with another smaller, independent personnel office here, so that will maybe open some doors. And I'll be putting in with some restaurants. Hopefully it won't take too long to find something I'm suitable for and that's suitable for me. And I can put up with anything for the amount of time it will take me to save up what I need to save.  Oh, and while I was at the mall buying a new pair of interview/business shoes ($13 at Payless and they're decently comfy and will work with pants or a skirt), I got on the $.25 scale and found I've dropped four pounds. And I haven't even had to do anything except, ya know, be poor and not eat. So yay! Considering I was at my high of 285# three years ago at this time, I'm thrilled to now weigh in at 249.2# (it's an exact scale). I haven't been under 250 since I lived in Mountain View, probably, and that's going on six years ago. So I say again, yay!  Hey ... Look! A happy post from me here for once! Yay (again)!  signed - Me  (PS - If anybody besides the wondermous  urlLink Elayne  actually reads here, drop a comment. Tell me I'm cool, tell me you sympathize, tell me to stop whining, offer up some advice I probably won't take. But speak up!)  (PPS - E, if you want me to unlink that, lemme know)  (PPPS - OH! Very Important note!! If you go looking up Arnold Schwarzenegger and his birthday, DO NOT! I repeat DO NOT!! click on the link for World of Celeb dot com! They will infest your computer with all sorts of shit you do not want on there. Bastards!)

      That's what I'm asking myself as I type this.  I sent K an email last night wherein I asked, "Have I ruined the chance for friendship?"   He replied, "No, but you're pushing it." And I'm not sure how much of that is with the bitchiness and how much is having asked the question. ::smile::   Much as I wanted to reply and apologize, for one thing, I had no idea what would be appropriate to say, and for another , I thought maybe it would be best to just let it lay for a bit, and finally, I've apologized for stupidity to him twice in the past five or six weeks and think any apology now would seem disingenuous, no matter how heartfelt it was.  But how long do I let it lay? And what do I say then? Do you know how much courage it takes to try and rectify being a bitch to somebody, even if it was only very minor? To try to be friends with somebody when things have gone between and you're not sure if you can completely get over it? And don't know if they care if they're friends with your or not, but suspect they don't?  I have no experience with this sort of thing. I know the strands are tenuous at best, and I don't know how to strengthen them. I don't have any super close friends. I have ones I've shared much of my life with; I have ones that when I really need an ear or a shoulder, I can write them and know I'll get support; I have ones I can have light chat with. But none that I feel I can totally be me with. There's always something I have to hold back because this friend or that would disapprove or worry or otherwise react badly.  I had two best friends in high school. One from since the fifth grade, the other since sixth or seventh. Probably the two people I was ever myself with most of the time at the time. Somehow, I managed to alienate the one from fifth grade. I was never quite sure how I'd done it, except maybe that he once had asked me out and I'd turned him down (and as it turned out, he's gay, which was no surprise to anybody.) The other, we just kind of drifted apart after I got married and moved away. But where I was going with this is that neither of them came to my wedding. The latter one was even supposed to have been my maid of honor. She begged off before the wedding - said something about a surgery, so she had a good excuse. But I still was saddened that neither of them came. And of course, I haven't heard from either in a couple of years.  And K .. Well, he's the sort that, before things turned less-than-platonic, I felt I could be myself with. He never judged me or tried to make me feel lesser or talked about trying to get in my pants. I liked him for that, still do, and he has a way about him that makes me believe him, makes me trust him, makes me respect him.  I really hope ... That someday, somehow, I can explain to him ...  But, will Sunday be to soon to start with "hello"?  signed - Me

      I'm making a few minor changes to my template.  To start, I'm going to link to my other, slightly more upbeat blog in the sidebar, though I won't be linking back to this one from there since I'm not yet ready for most people to see this one yet. And  I especially don't want K to stumble across this if he would ever happen to click on my other from the site we're both on. It's too fresh for that.  Additionally, most entries that go over two or three paragraphs or are otherwise way, way long have been trimmed to a brief summary and the full text can be gotten to by clicking the "See full post..." link at the bottom of each, which will open the post in a new window. Unfortunately, there's no way currently to only put that on summarized posts so that even the short ones that you see in their entirety on the main and archive pages have it. I suppose some sort of JavaScript could be written for it so that only posts over a specified length would be affected, but... ick. Not my forté.  The clue that there is more is, as you can read in the sidebar, that it won't have a signature at the bottom. I'm also working on making all links to individual post pages open in new windows, not just the "See full post..." link.  This slight redesign means I've had to remove the signature from the template I'm using, go through and edit my posts to put the proper code in the ones I want summarized, and sign them. Bit of a pain. But as I've only got 40 posts here and 15 on the other (so far), it's not as bad as it would be if I had many, many more.  signed - Me

      Well now, here's the thought...  How can I even be thinking about trying to maintain a friendship with K? When at the moment, I keep thinking about how much I still want him?   I'm wanting him in my life for selfish reasons and with those pop-up window thoughts I previously  mentioned, I don't think it would really be good for me, and what do I have to offer him by way of friendship that he doesn't have elsewhere? Doesn't need comfort from me - he has a girlfriend for that. Doesn't need relationship advice - probably has other friends for that, and besides, who am I to talk? Doesn't need me to cheer him up or make him laugh - see: girlfriend.  ::sigh::  Trying to fight off that suffocating feeling again. I just don't  care  about anything. ANYthing. Not the forum I run, not the sites I visit, not the graphics I do, not the people I talk to - mostly just wish they'd shut up - not eating, not anything. Not without him, and he's not even real. He was just an idea. (Yeah, I know, shut up and stop whining, but c'mon, I'm heartbroken here and will be for a while yet.)  God, I was so desperate for somebody to chat to&nbsp;yesterday morning that I made up a new ID for myself and went into a Yahoo!IM chatroom of all places. That was a waste of time. Don't know what I was thinking. It was boring as hell and what I need and want is not going to be found in there. Won't be found anywhere online ever again.  What is awful for me is that  she  has started posting in the  b.com &nbsp;forums. Why does she have to be posting in there? If she becomes prolific, I may have to leave the site. And they have a website together. Gag a maggot. I shouldn't have read the damn thing. They're freaking GOR. Or at least she is. And she said they'd had online "pillowtalk". Blech. And&nbsp;why should they be happy when I'm hurting because of them? Why am I letting myself hurt because of them? Because of him, who didn't want me, but let me think he did.  Why can't he ... be in love with me?  (Pop-up window thought: In his section it had said they'd fought a lot and broken it off, and it seems they only or at least mostly only have been online so far, and he's 21 and she's 18, so maybe when they move in, it won't work out, and that shouldn't make me smile. My god, he actually  bought  a condo, though I don't know if that was mostly for school at the time or specifically so they could live together. He's been working his ass off for money for school and apparently the condo, and she said in the spring she'd contacted him, which kinda puts lie to his telling me she hadn't been an issue, because we'd still been talking then. Maddening, but then, she'd always been an issue. Has been an issue for him for two-and-a-half years. Plese let them break up. Bad me.)   [note: 7/13/2004 - a recent entry on her site said they were coming up on the two month mark, so that would mean she'd contacted him early-ish May, at which point contact had been deteriorating, but hadn't cut off completely. So he's half right about it not being an issue then. I still would've liked to have been told, however, so that I wouldn't have kept trying for so long to get things back to a place they weren't going to be getting back to. And no, I do not want them to break up because I know how he would feel if that happened and, well, I care about him, even if things are messed up with little chance of getting better and he's slipping out of my life. I don't want to see him hurt.]   Argh, how stupid can I get. I have  got  to get a job and soon. I need something else to think about, something to help me focus on my goal. I won't find what I want or need sitting around here all day being depressed.  As much as I want to try, I don't think I can be friends with K. I don't think it would be good for me. But I don't ... I can't not try. I have to try. (Yeah, that's me, never give up until there's no other choice. I hate that about myself sometimes.) But I shouldn't. I should cut him off my lists and move on and stop thinking about him and get over it. But I'm not quite over L, either, and that's been since November last. I still try and look him up every once in a while, though I don't have any luck.  I wonder what's going on in his life. The last I knew, L had lost his job and his wife had found out about his online and offline activities. He'd had a mistress there (and that about killed me because once he met her, I had to hear about it and I dropped several notches down his importance scale) and when I looked up her profile the other day, it said "Home wrecker!!!!! And lovin' every minute of it!!!!" and had been updated last month, so I wonder if they got together. I remember he'd said she was falling for him and him for her... Which then makes me wonder if ... things I shouldn't wonder because it's probably just a self-esteem issue. I have to believe he cut it off with her when he said he did and tried to work it out with his wife and wasn't just using "my wife found out" as some lame excuse because he didn't want to hurt me. I hate that sort of crap. Particularly when I was the one that told him that if his mistress was bothered by his having other online "friends", then  he should dump the onlines.  Yeah, I know.  And I was actually kinda sickened when he told me about the arrangements he'd made to deceive his wife so he and his mistress could have a night together. I mean, when it was just him telling her he was going into town for something, that didn't bother me much because it actually required him going into town to do whatever it was he'd said he was going to do. But to have a night together, he had to do some serious planning and that bothered me a whole lot more because it was so much more underhanded. And he was letting his wife think he wouldn't be home for an extra day, was going to be halfway around the world an extra day, so he could be with a woman who lived probably not more than fifty miles from his home.  Ick.  And still I was devastated when it ended.  Do you see what a marriage void of love and affection can do to you? It makes your brain and heart totally scramble the signals so that you don't care if the person is completely not for you (and let's face it, if either of them had been for me, I'd still have one of them, wouldn't I?) as long as you have  somebody .  Blah.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, so say it with me now: What a mess.  I'm tired. I'm depressed. I'm bored. I'm unloved in the way I need to be loved. I'd say I need a beer and a cigarette if I drank and smoked, but maybe a scoop of rocky road will do. I've given myself a headache, too, so I think I'll throw in some ibuprofen.  signed - Me

      Of a sort, I hope, anyhow.  Husband and I finally got our rings back from the pawn broker on Friday. On the one hand - yay! I mean, they cost a lot of money and we only got $150 for them on loan. Shallow, I know, but the replacement cost is half-a-year's rent at the moment.   On the other hand ... It was like putting on shackles with hundred pound weights attached. I was dreading the moment of putting them back on because they don't mean much of anything anymore. They're pretty to look at, and they do look nice on my hand, but ... ::shrug::  Monday I'll go put in job applications. I was going to do it Thursday, but the water heater for the other half of the duplex had problems, so they turned off the hot water to both apartments, didn't turn the water back on until around 3pm some time, and the gas didn't come back on until after five, so there were no showers and I was pretty grody. We had McDonald's for dinner on account of it's a gas stove and no gas = no cook. I'm still smelling some gas, though, and we might need to have PG&E come out and take a look around.  And the video card on the computer went out. Dead. Kaput. Kerfluey. Kerflunk. Replacing it was a $120 expense we didn't need but couldn't get around. Have to have the computer so husband can do his job hunting. I don't do too much on here these days, but I do get online out of habit, and it's a hard one to break. Always kinda hope there's somebody around to chat to, but I've only got two people on my list, and one of them is K, and ... I'm not sure we're on speaking terms at all anymore. I kinda flipped a bit - not a lot, just a bit of, "Why didn't you TELL me you had a girlfriend?!" and he couldn't understand why I was upset he hadn't said and ...   Have I mentioned I am SO not doing the man/woman thing again for like, a decade? I mean, really, if I'm this bad off over an internet non-relationship, can you imagine how bad it would be for one that was real-time? Ok, the four guys I've been with, I've all met through the internet -   Guy 1: Slimy ex-b/f who I didn't love and when I found out I was dumped, I cried for two days and got over it. He was slime and I knew it and it wasn't that horrible. I sometimes think maybe it had more of a negative effect on me than I would like to think it did, but ... SLIME! I won't allow it. (His name is Brian, he lived in Topeka, KS in summer of 1996, dumped me for a girl in Wisconsin saying we lived too far apart - hello! Me in Lecompton, you in Topeka, that's 30 miles, tops, and she's in WISCONSIN!!! Or was it Michigan? Minnesota? One of those northern states that was a lot farther from him than I was, and according to her he got her to make a truck payment before he dumped her which is ... I don't know if it's worse or on par with him taking my virginity and dumping me - and would currently be about 29 years of age. 6ft some, blonde, smoker, not really that attractive... Stay away from him.)  Guy 2: Short-term fuck-buddy. He was nice, but there was no passion there. Good but unexciting sex. He got a goodbye blowjob, so I don't think he was too busted up about it.  Guy 3: Ok, this guy was nuttier than a fruitcake and I have NO idea why I had sex with him except I was very horny at the time and my common sense flew right out the window. Get this - I didn't talk to him - at all - for over three years. Logged into that account maybe once every six months. There were  always  IMs from him waiting. Always. And eventually he caught me on and we started talking. Then I got a good excuse to cut him off and he went apeshit.  And I hadn't even spoken to him in three years!  You'd think he'd've gotten the hint!  Guy 4: Married him. If you've been keeping up, you know how that's goin'.  Then in the past year there have been two internet-only trysts (for lack of a better word) - K and L. L was from June 2003 to November 2003 then it got cut off because his wife found out.   Yeah, I know.  Bad enough I was talking to somebody behind my husband's back, but also behind the guy's wife's back. Oddly, I never felt all that guilty about it, though I probably should've. Don't get me wrong - I generally stay far away from married men or men in relationships. I'm selfish and want them for myself as much as possible if I'm going to be involved with them like that. So I don't know quite why I made the exception with L. He had that undefinable  something  that turns me into the lamb led to slaughter. And when it ended, I did feel slaughtered.   I kinda think that's part of why this thing with K has been so hard, too. K was right on the heels of that, by about two months. I think it's probably a bad idea to form new attachments that early. For instance, when my family put down the dog we'd had for 13 years nearly two years ago, my parents went out and got a new dog almost the next week (and she is an adorable little thing, if a bit bitchy at times). So when she got out and was picked up by a stranger, it was terrible. I spent the night weeping and praying (I hate that term, but it's the vernacular) for her return. Thankfully the people called the next day and my dad went to pick her up, but for the evening she was gone, it was awful.  So in people terms, with my attachment to K forming so soon and so quickly (once again, a guy with that undefinable  something ) after L, it set me up for a very hard fall. And with two hard falls in such a short time when for years there had been nothing much except my frustration over my husband, during which time I'd learned to suppress a lot of those things L and K dredged up, it's set me on the road of  needing  to get out of my marriage. L and K did bring up so many things I'd learned to deny to myself - L re-awakening my sexual desires and bringing to the fore my submissive tendencies in that area, K re-awakening the need for affection as well as furthering the return of the sexual side and propping up the burgeoning submissiveness - that I now realize I can't go on like I had been, can't allow myself to keep stagnating like I have been.  Last afternoon, I took a nap and had a rather unpleasant dream where I was attempting to drive K and his girl apart so that I could have him and failing miserably. I woke up quite upset because for one, I realized I'm not getting over K as quickly as I would like, and two, that is  so  not who I am. I am not the sort to deliberately set out to wreck a relationship or to set out for my own happiness at the expense of the happiness of those I care about, and that I've been having these thoughts, these little pop-up window thoughts, where I hope for something to go wrong so I can have him back ... It really bothers me. I am happy for him, I adore him, he's one of my favorite people in the world and if I had a little brother, I'd want him to be like K, and I really hope I can maintain his friendship - I'm going to need it in the coming months as I very much value his opinions - so you can see why even the passing thoughts wrought from my unhappiness for  his  unhappiness ... Ick. It makes me feel ... icky! There is no other word. I am making myself feel icky about myself!   (Is it wrong of me to hate the girl by default, though? I've seen her picture and she's just so ... twee. Blah. Yeah, yeah, it's the jealousy. I'm sure she's lovely and wonderful and if she were like I'd like to think she is, K would have no interest. Still ... ok. There are those thoughts again. Shoo, shoo, shoo! I do not want one or the other to dump the other. I don't! ... I am so not dealing well ...)  ::deep breath::  Whew.  I kinda feel like one of Nicole Kidman's crazier characters. She plays loony well. If I were about 100lbs lighter, I think I could give her a run for her money.   Oh... I had a dream the other night that something I'd said was quoted and Kidman wound up getting the credit for both what I'd said AND this blog. I was fit to be tied.  Anyhow.  After that dream about K, I got up to do dishes and fix dinner and I was crying (again) and I felt like I was going to suffocate. In the midst of the dishes, I stopped, went to put on jeans, then went outside and just stood there for a while. I couldn't stand being in the apartment, it felt like I was drowning. A little while later, I came back in and started to finish the dishes, then stopped and went into the bedroom and sat and hugged my pillow and cried a little more, then finished the dishes and started on dinner, got that going, then had to take off my pants and underwear because they felt too restrictive. About halfway through my meal, I started feeling suffocated again and asked husband, "Do you want ice cream?", got dressed and walked up to the local market for some. Came back, took off the pants and underwear again, finished eating, then decided I had to shave my legs RIGHT NOW! or I'd go batty and took care of that. Hadn't shaved in about a month - legs, pits, or other bits - and at right that second, I could not wait one more or I'd have screamed. And in the theme of feeling suffocated, yes, looking at my hairy legs made me feel like I was suffocating.  It was a rather long night, and now I'm feeling like I have GOT to take these damn rings off or I will SUFFOCATE!  signed - Me

      Now that I'm working, updates will be far fewer. For one thing, I have less time to be depressed, and there's really not that much to bitch about at work yet, other than being understaffed.   But the main thing is that the time isn't there. I get maybe an hour in the evening unless husband goes to bed early, and there's no time in the morning before going to work. So probably Thursdays or Fridays I'll get around to posting if I can remember what I was going to post.  At the moment, though, it's bedtime!   signed - Me
