       Good morning,   As promised, this morning I'd like to review the customized nutritional tests that are available through Ideal Health and Metametrix.  1.  PrivaTest (basic foundational test covered earlier this week).  2.  AllerTest  Are some of the foods you eat make you sick?  Find out with the AllerTest.  I heard a story over the weekend.  A women who grew up on a poultry farm suffered form psoriasis all of her life.  At the age of 48 she took the AllerTest and found out she was allergic to eggs of all things!  Eliminating eggs from her diet and now taking AllerCaps her once severe psoriasis is 99% gone!  3.  OsteoTest  Find out if you are at risk for bone loss.  Complications due to osteoporosis are the 12th leading cause of death in American and more than 25 million Americans are candidates for developing osteoporosis.  Get tested today and see if you should be taking OsteoCaps. This is really important for us 30 something's as well....we haven't been taking the calcium we need (especially if we've been on oral/injection birth control for long periods of time).    4.  StressTest  Are you stressed?? Don't worry - you are not alone.  But there is help available with our StressCaps. Find out what you can do to support your body and keep your adrenal glands and support system healthy and functioning at its best.  5. DigestTest  How well does your body absorb the protein you ingest? With all the low carb diets now and protein intake on the rise...test and find out how your body is functioning. If your body is having trouble breaking down protein, then you cannot absorb amino acids from the protein you eat....this can cause gas, heartburn, brittle hair and nails and much more. If your body needs help here, not to worry - we have DigestCaps for you.  6.  ImmunoTest  Just like it sounds....find out how your body's immune system is working. Are you sick all of the time -do you catch every cold that goes around?  Take the test to see if you should be taking - even occassionally - ImmunoCaps.  All of these tests are available through Ideal Health.  To order your test, call me directly - I'd be happy to help you.  919.593.1026 or call Ideal Health directly at 1-800-768-7667 and use id number 3455726.  Remember May is buy the PrivaTest and get any other test at 1/2 off.   Of course, we are not presribing or diagnosing - always check with your health care professional if you have any questions or concerns about supplementation.  If you have a success story you'd like to share with us...please post your comments on the blog...that's why it's here!  in good health...  Lucia lucia@customforyou.com 919.593.1026

       Good morning,   After my Friday post, I got a few inquiries asking "What is the PrivaTest and how does it work"?  My apologies! Let me explain..  The PrivaTest is a confidential, highly scientific in-home test you perform to take a look at how your body is functioning, and how well your body is absorbing nutrients from food and any supplements you may already be taking.  If you are currently on supplements you may be over or under supplementing...You'll find out with this test.  The test is mailed to you and is a urine test you do at home.  You simply complete the survey and follow the testing instructions.  Then you mail the test via FedEx (not a cost to you- prepaid) and wait for your results.  A customized, daily formulation of supplements are prepared and mailed to you (a monthly supply)with your 10 page nutritional analysis for you to review.  When I did my test, my supplements, free ceramic jar and report arrived in about 7 days... depending upon demand it could take as many as 10-15 days...lately it's busy and can take as much as that. However, if you are eager to get started we have a wonderful product line to "prep" your body for your custom essentials and those you can begin taking right away - just give me a call or email and we can get you started.  For those of you who'd like additional information, email me at lucia@customforyou.com.  We can chat or if you prefer, I still have some audio cassettes about the process and benefits of testing I can drop in the mail to you.  I listen to cassette tapes in the car just running errands...nice not to have to listen to commercials actually!  There are several more tests Ideal Health offers and we'll go over those this week right here in the blog. Then we can review the entire product line so you can decide which products are right for you.  in good health...  Lucia lucia@customforyou.com 919.593.1026

       I have a friend in Ideal Health who is a chiropractor. She issued a challenge to her patients seeking a weight loss solution.  15 folks agreed to the Serotonin Plus challenge. And in ONE week each of the 15 had lost at least 3 pounds.   She told me that their cravings for carbs, chocolate, snacks were gone.  Many are sleeping more deeply through the night.  Energy levels are on the rise!  I must admit, I don't know how many pounds I've lost these past 2 weeks - but I need to get on a scale soon!  Keep the stories coming!   Remember to place your order call me directly at 919-593-1026 or 800-768-7667 (id#3455726).  Best wishes, Lucia

       I was talking with a friend last night about our product line.  She was just overwhelmed and asked me just what was the best way to get started.    I think the best approach is to first complete the pre-screen form and go through the health questions to determine what testing you'd like to do in addition to the Privatest.   The Privatest is the first step. You can then begin your custom essentials and your 10-page lab report will make suggestions about other supplements you should consider.    Remember in June with a purchase of the Privatest you get 1/2 off any other test (osteotest, allertest, etc.)!  Contact me directly if you'd like a copy of your own prescreen form or if you would like help ordering your tests today.  Lucia  919.593.1026

       I received my Serotonin (90 day program) on Thursday of last week.  As of Friday the product is on backorder again I am told!  That's ok, go ahead and place your order anyway. I waited about 8 days in total from placing the order to getting my supply (it was on backorder the day I ordered as well).  The 90 day program comes with tablets for 90 days as well as a guide with instructions, and menus for 12 weeks.  To tell you the truth I was terrified of what the menu selections would look like, but the menu isn't bad at all. Certainly low in carbs..however you can begin to re-introduce carbs after JUST 4 weeks with the Serotonin Plus Diet.  I am very excited and cannot wait to hear all of the wonderful success stories that we'll have to share with this new weight management program.   To order call the company direct at 800-768-7667 (use id #3455726) or contact me at 919.593-1026 or lucia@customforyou.com.  Thanks! Lucia

Atkins - 14 pounds 3.  South Beach - 13 pounds 4.  Weight Watchers - 10 pounds 5.  eDiets - 9 pounds 6.

       Good afternoon,  To the many thousands of you out there (45,000 or so) who called in to inquire about Supreme Greens after watching the 30 minute television infomercial - our apologies for not getting back to you yet!  Ideal health is launching a massive campaign beginning this week for distributors in the field and you will begin to receive a follow up call and a letter with some promotional coupons and information about the product you asked for more information about. It's probably Supreme Greens, however there have been some shows on Femerex and UroCaps as well.   We need more field reps to respond to the overwhelming number of customer inquiries received each week.  If you or someone you know is seeking a supplemental income that you can work from home, please contact me via phone or email to schedule a 20 minute presentation so we can share this information with you.   Best wishes and talk soon!  Lucia  lucia@customforyou.com 919.593.1026
