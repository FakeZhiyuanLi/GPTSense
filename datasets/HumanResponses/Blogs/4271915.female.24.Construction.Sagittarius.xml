          Time is a sort of river of passing events, and strong as its current; no  sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its  place, and this too will be swept away.    - Marcus Aurelius Antoninus    If you find in your heart a fervent passion to  seek God, remember it is He who has given your heart.     -Jack D. Curson  III

         In the end, all I want to be is a good  father and husband. I have no need to leave a legacy or shine in the light of  the world that rots upon itself. My family hopefully will grow with the ideals  that God is our center and without him, nothing we have, our fortunes, blessings  and the graces He has bestowed upon us would matter. It is He who has brought  forth the opportunities that we have, the two young sons that He has let my wife  and I borrow for a time, a love,&nbsp;our marriage, which no storm could dare  drown. It is He who has built the man that continues to grow day by day in the  guidance of His footsteps. I can thank no other for the life I live but the one  who has so graciously given the heart which beats for the Faith, Hope and Love  instilled within my soul.

      Well, Grandpa Gary has "The Dude" Jonathan for the day and Grandma Kay is coming to pick up the "Uber-Cute" baby Caiden for who knows how long. We will enjoy the free time, even though being over-protective parents we will worry about them constantly. I wonder if this feeling ever goes away, I mean if Jonathan is out of my site for more than two seconds, literally, I have to go looking for him. All the what if's start popping in my head;  What if...  He sticks a rock in his mouth and swallows it? He climbs to the top of the dog house a falls off onto his head? He just plain hurts himself in whatever way and is bleeding or broken?  It is the psychotic-ness of parental responsibility that intertwines with a demented imagination in a frantically dysfunctional world, which pulls a mind to radically change fundamental decisions within the inner circles of&nbsp;his/her life. I know that is a lot to take in, read carefully I am sure you will get the picture. Why should I just trust the outside circles in my life because "they raised children of their own" and that should just solidify my trust in them, when the trust shown in return is infinitesimal. What object or person close to their heart would they trust in my hands that needs and wants the active communication and resulting behavioral conditions that I wish to instill in my children? They would have no such object or person to give.  But in the end, all this shows is the amount of doubt and trust I have in my Father above. He will watch over my children, and whatever happens, happens.  Remember…  Faith, Hope and Love…

        Yesterday I took my&nbsp;family to the doctors and found out&nbsp;my wife&nbsp;has Pneumonia. The first thing that pops into my head is, "great we are all going to get sick". Just what our newborn needs to be around, someone with a sickness that could kill him. Then again, being the ill informed husband that I am, the doctor assures my wife that she isn't contagious and that the baby will be fine. But just to be on the safe side we took both kids to their doctors as well. They both have colds, so they will survive. But the most interesting part of the day wasn't the positive news of the illness my wife brought home, it was the fun we had trying to find someone in the doctors office with jumper cables since our van decided not to start. 95 degree whether, two kids who needed naps, a wife with pneumonia and a van with no juice in the battery, What a day!     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      Well, here are the introductions for our family’s pets. Louie is 8 years old and is one of the nicest Manx cats you will ever meet. He was an inside cat for 7 years until he ran away last year for two and a half months. He finally decided to come on home; I am assuming he missed us.  &nbsp;  Beowulf is a miracle dog. When he was 3 months old he was infected with the Parvo virus and was near death for most of his puppy life. My wife and I had to give him intravenous fluids and two antibiotics three times daily. Now everything is cool and his is the greatest dog I have ever had. He is my best animal friend.  &nbsp;  Then there is the new comer, Ms. Miakoda. We adopted her from the Animal Shelter in Davis, CA. Her mom was feed rat poison while in delivery of her babies. Suffice it to say, Miakoda and one other sibling are the only survivors. I know, sad but definitely true. She is rambunctious, mischievous, none committed to learning and loves to play and chew up anything that catches a glimpse of her eyes. Other than being the normal puppy Beowulf never was, she is a rather good dog. But she definitely needs some training bad.  &nbsp;  Anyways, that is the short and sweet of the Curson's Animal Kingdom.

       urlLink      My friends without children always ask me what do I mean by children changing the way you feel about life. Why does a child make you change? What do you mean love just feels so much deeper? And I can never really give an answer that could give another heart understanding.   Just believe me, children just open the doors to a life you have forgotten to live. &nbsp; Just look, how could you not love this face.

      Well, I hope these pictures speak volumes for&nbsp;our little family introduction. We love each other and thank God each day for the blessings he has bestowed upon us.  &nbsp;  What we&nbsp;view with our eyes is much to easy to see, I am inviting you to gaze into the heart and soul of a life to live on. So grab a chair and sit on down, stay awhile, the best is yet to come.

      It appears that I have gallstones. I saw the surgeon yesterday and he tells me that the whole gallbladder has to be removed. The surgery is very easy and recovery is swift for most people. I hope I'm one of those people. To tell the truth I'm pretty scared of being put under general anesthesia. It's really the fear of never waking up again that freaks me out. I mean, I have 2 very little kids who wouldn't even have memories of me if I were to die anytime soon. That thought keeps me up at night sometimes. I know it's not right for me to be so scared of dying, with all the love and support that God has given me. I should be grateful for every second I've had, and I am. It's just that I'm not ready to go.  Anyways, enough with that. My surgery will be at 10am on 8/26. I am putting out a request to my husband right now, that I would love very much for him to be there and hold my hand. To pet me and talk to me while I'm waking up. To show me that he is compassionate and loves me more than anything on this planet, with the exception of our two precious babies of course.  :o)  I'm sure I'll post more as the time draws nearer....8 days and counting....

         Today is my son's 2nd Birthday. He is  getting so big so fast, I can't believe he is already two. One of these days you  will be able to read this Jonathan, I love you son, more than you will ever  know. I hope that you grow up with God walking with you step for step. I can  only hope you are as happy with me as I am with you. You bring me so much joy  and I can only thank God for given me the time I have with you as my son. You  are such a wonderful little dude.

         Today my wife goes back to work after two  months on maternity leave. She is taking it pretty well although she was up  crying in the middle of the night.&nbsp;My wife&nbsp;is so sweet, loving her  babies the way she does. But she really isn't stay at home material, just ask  her. Anyways, the baby will be fine and Jonathan loves being at his Grandma's  house so it shouldn't be a big deal. I guess we will see how this week goes and  modify whatever we need to make things comfortable.      &nbsp;    I Corinthians 13:1-13      &nbsp;     &nbsp;
