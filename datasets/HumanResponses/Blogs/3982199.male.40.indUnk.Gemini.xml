       urlLink    Fox Denning up in the highlands from about 1992. The end of the day. Young Paul, Rob, Dave and Johnny head back to the pick up after a successful dig to a vixen on the north coast of Sutherland. We sat out that night and got the dog fox too. He came in about 2.00am.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Brucey my old collie x greyhound aged approx 13 and still up for a hunt. His speed had long gone but he'd still pick up the odd bird, such as this moorhen, when out on exercise. He sadly left for those great hunting grounds in the sky in June of this year aged 14.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Fox Denning in Scotland. Happy gamekeepers up in the Highlands. We sat out at a den site through the night to get these foxes. The den had been worked with a terrier during the day but the vixen wasn't at home. The vixen came in around 11.00pm and the dog fox turned up a couple of hours later. It was a very bleak night out on those Sutherland moors but well worth it.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Squatter! Term given to rabbits by lampers which choose to squat down rather than run for home. This is not done because the lamp dazzles or blinds them but because the rabbit believes by staying motionless it will be overlooked. Their shining red eyes often give away their presence. A good lamping lurcher must be able to pick up squatters. Many inexperienced dogs will only run a moving rabbit.&nbsp; urlLink

       The fox pictured below was, luckily for it, captured on camera only! We had bushed this particular fox from some bramble beds several times this last season. It nearly always ran the same route to escape through the grounds of an old lodge house. On this day I positioned myself with the camera in the path I presumed it would take. My young son was hunting the dogs through the bramble beds and out he came, almost walking right into me. Despite what the opponents of hunting may say this fox was unconcerned and was actually calmly stopping to look back at the dogs as I took the picture. The flash of the camera startled him and off he went again, on a slightly different route and lived to run another day.

       urlLink    Ferreting with nets & lurcher up in the wilds of Sutherland. The ferret has killed a rabbit below ground here and my hunting partner is trying to find it with the locater box. This was quite an extensive warren and you can just make out the lurcher {top right} guarding the nets at the far end of it. Note the white coloured nets with the bright red draw cords; very hard to lose or miss when picking up. No the rabbits dont see them either so dont worry about that.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    I'd never go ferreting without a lurcher to help. This bitch loves to get into an excavation and pull out any dead rabbits. The ferret has killed one underground here and Duncan my keeper friend is struggling to reach it or even find it. This is where a keen lurcher can assist. There was a junction of tunnels in this excavation. The lurcher marked the one in which the rabbit lay. The ferret had pulled it a lttle deeper as we dug above her !&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Highland keepers game larder with a good haul of bunnies in. During the course of the season this larder will hold grouse, rabbits, hares, red deer, roe deer, occasionally sika deer, woodcock, duck, geese, etc. The game dealer will call in once or twice a week in his refridgerated wagon and take everything. By the way all of these rabbits were hanging up. We just laid them down to get a better picture.After capture all of the rabbits are immediately paunched and hung. Hares are hung with their guts still in for some strange gastronomical reason. These rabbits were mostly ferreted into nets, or lamped by lurchers. At the time they were fetching less than 50 pence each off the game dealer. Many were getting shipped to China which seems crazy to me. Rabbit is good healthy, lean meat. I cannot understand why it isn't more popular in this country?&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    There's plenty of rabbits about at the moment now that all of the crops are getting cut. They were sitting out in good numbers the other evening as I had a walk out with my lurcher bitch just before dusk. Her's a picture of her, belly to the ground, stalking right up to one.&nbsp; urlLink
