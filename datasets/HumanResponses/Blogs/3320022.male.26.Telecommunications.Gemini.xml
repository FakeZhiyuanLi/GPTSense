       The program subclasses the main form and watches for the  WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING message. When it sees that message, the program  moves the satellite forms to stay with the main form.  ' Process messages. Public Function NewWindowProc(ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal msg As Long,  ByVal wParam As Long, lParam As WINDOWPOS) As Long Const WM_NCDESTROY = &H82 Const WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING = &H46      ' If we're being destroyed,     ' restore the original WindowProc.     If msg = WM_NCDESTROY Then         SetWindowLong _             hwnd, GWL_WNDPROC, _             OldWindowProc     Else         ' See if the window is moving.         If msg = WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING Then             ' The window is moving. Keep the others with it.             Form2.Move Form1.Left + Form1.Width, Form1.Top - 360             Form3.Move Form1.Left - Form3.Width, Form1.Top - 360         End If     End If      ' Continue normal processing. VERY IMPORTANT!     NewWindowProc = CallWindowProc( _         OldWindowProc, hwnd, msg, wParam, _         lParam) End Function  This program removes the title bar from the satellite forms so you  cannot move them directly. You could try to subclass them as well but  moving the group as a whole would be more complicated. For example, you  might need to be able to ignore WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING messages while you  are moving one of the forms. This example should get you started,  though. ==========

       The main form's KeyPreview is True so its KeyDown and Keyup event  handlers get keyboard events. Those event handlers set a value in an  array to indicate whether a key is up or down.  One odd case that this handles is when the user presses multiple keys.  The array will know if the user is holding down the Left and Up arrows  at the same time.  'This vector contains the state of all keys 'I think KeyCode goes from 0 to 255, but you 'can change this if you want Dim Keys(255) As Boolean  'Its used to stop the Do-Loop of the Form_Load Dim StopLoop As Boolean  Private Sub Form_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)    'The key KeyCode is pressed now...    Keys(KeyCode) = True End Sub  Private Sub Form_KeyUp(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)    'The key KeyCode is NOT pressed now...    Keys(KeyCode) = False End Sub  Private Sub Form_Load() Dim str As String     Me.Show     'The form must handle the key events    Me.KeyPreview = True     StopLoop = False     Do       'Just check for the arrow keys to see       'if they are pressed. To check form more       'keys, just ask for the correct subindex       'in the "Keys" array       str = ""        If Keys(vbKeyUp) Then str = str + "UP" & vbCrLf       If Keys(vbKeyDown) Then str = str + "DOWN" & vbCrLf       If Keys(vbKeyLeft) Then str = str + "LEFT" & vbCrLf       If Keys(vbKeyRight) Then str = str + "RIGHT" & vbCrLf        'Refresh the label       lblKeys = str        'Important!!

       This program uses the ClientToScreen API function to convert the target  coordinates from the screen's coordinate system to the screen's  coordinates system. It then uses the SetCursorPos API function to move  the mouse there.  Sub MoveMouse(x As Single, y As Single) Dim pt As POINTAPI      pt.x = x     pt.y = y     ClientToScreen hwnd, pt     SetCursorPos pt.x, pt.y End Sub

       This program simply loops through the pixels in the images. For each  image in top-to-bottom order, the program looks for a color other than  the one defined as transparent. When it finds such a color, it stops  looking at the images and sets the output pixel's color using PSet.  Private Sub cmdCombine_Click() Dim max_input As Integer Dim transparent As Long Dim wid As Single Dim hgt As Single Dim X As Single Dim Y As Single Dim i As Integer Dim clr As Long      cmdCombine.Enabled = False     MousePointer = vbHourglass     DoEvents      max_input = picInput.ubound     For i = 0 To max_input         picInput(i).AutoRedraw = True         picInput(i).ScaleMode = vbPixels     Next i      picResult.Width = picInput(0).Width     picResult.Height = picInput(0).Height     picResult.ScaleMode = vbPixels      transparent = picTransparent.BackColor     wid = picInput(0).ScaleWidth     hgt = picInput(0).ScaleHeight     For Y = 0 To hgt         For X = 0 To wid             For i = max_input To 0 Step -1                 clr = picInput(i).Point(X, Y)                 If clr <> transparent Then Exit For             Next i             picResult.PSet (X, Y), clr         Next X         DoEvents     Next Y     picResult.Picture = picResult.Image      cmdCombine.Enabled = True     MousePointer = vbDefault      Beep End Sub  Note that there are faster ways to access color values in V 6 and VB  .NET, and that there are faster methods for merging images if you have  an overlay mask. Note also that VB .NET provides tools for setting a  transparent color for an image so this problem is trivial in VB .NET. ==========

      Iran seized eight Royal Navy and Royal Marines personnel in three patrol boats on the Shatt al Arab waterway yesterday, claiming that they had strayed across the border with Iraq.  The boats, which were being delivered to the Iraqi riverine patrol service, were flying the White Ensign. They were travelling up the waterway towards Basra.      British troops on patrol on the Shatt al Arab in southern Iraq  Teheran said: "British boats entered territorial waters of the Islamic Republic of Iran and officials of the naval force, in accordance to its laws, seized the boats and arrested the eight crew members aboard.  "Interrogation of those detained will continue until the matter is clarified."  An Iranian Arabic-language television station which broadcasts to the mainly Shia population of southern Iraq said the Royal Navy personnel had "confessed that they have made a mistake".  British sources in Baghdad appeared to confirm that the boats had crossed into Iranian territorial waters in the waterway, which has long been a matter of contention between Iran and Iraq.      There was immediate speculation that the arrests were linked to the row over Iran's nuclear programme.  The Iranians were infuriated after Britain helped to draft a highly critical resolution at the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog, condemning Teheran's failure to co-operate fully with international inspections.  Although the Iranians insist that the programme is purely for civil purposes, there are fears in the West that it is a cover for developing nuclear weapons.  The Foreign Office said it was in contact with the Iranian government to find out more details and "try to reach a satisfactory solution".  It played down suggestions of a tit-for-tat action by the Iranian government in response to last Friday's resolution by the IAEA. But privately officials admitted that there might have been an "opportunistic" attempt at retribution by hard-line elements associated with the Revolutionary Guards, the troops in charge of protecting Iran's Islamic revolution.  Islamic students regularly demonstrate outside the British mission in Teheran over Britain's "occupation" of holy Shia sites in Iraq, something they could not do without the sanction of the Revolutionary Guards.  Iranian state television played down the seizure of the vessels in its evening news bulletin, giving only a brief mention of the arrests.  The seized craft are believed to be Italian-made patrol boats which were bought by Saddam Hussein's regime but never delivered because of UN sanctions.  The Royal Navy is in charge of training Iraq's new naval forces and a joint Royal Navy-Royal Marines unit was set up for that purpose.  Behind the scenes, Britain has been playing the good guy to America's tough guy to try to raise relations with Teheran from the low point of the 1980s and the late Ayatollah Khomeini's regime.  Contacts at a number of levels, which are believed to have included an MI6 back-channel set up in the mid-1990s, have led to five visits to Teheran by Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary.  British officials said that, although the standard Teheran response to any action it disagreed with was a tit-for-tat retaliation, such moves tended to be much more measured than the Shatt al Arab incident.  "Of course they do not like the IAEA resolution and they have made that clear," an offical said. "It would be no surprise if there was a frostiness to our diplomatic relations as a result.  "But it would be unusual for them to link high policy matters to something like this. This smacks more of opportunism."

      Tony Blair predicted yesterday that he would win a battle "between myth and reality" over Europe as he gave himself two years to persuade the British people to accept the new EU constitution.  He defied Conservative demands to call the promised referendum as soon as possible, making clear he would not so until after the next general election.      Tony Blair in determined mood during his interview  As a hard-core of Labour MPs prepared to launch their own campaigns against the constitutional treaty today and fresh opinion polls showed a public majority opposed to it, Mr Blair accepted that he faced a "tough battle" to win over its critics.  But, if given time, he would succeed. "This is going to be a fascinating political battle because it will be a battle between reality and myth.  "If you actually have a debate about the reality then people will say 'well what's wrong with that? Why aren't we being part of that'?"  The constitution, agreed on Friday after an acrimonious summit in Brussels, does not have to be ratified until the end of 2006, meaning that Mr Blair can hold off the referendum until well after the election, expected in early summer next year.  He said on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost that there was "absolutely no need" to call a national vote in a hurry. The only reason his opponents were trying to force the pace was to limit the time pro-Europeans would have to expose the "myths" being peddled about the treaty.  The Tories and some Labour MPs replied saying the British people deserved the chance to have their say as soon as possible.  Last night Frank Field, the Euro-sceptic former Labour minister, said it was "nonsense" to say that a referendum could not be held until after the election on the grounds that there was insufficient time to complete the formalities in Parliament. "It could all be done in a few months," he said. Mr Field feared that the whole issue could do serious damage to Labour at the election and said that Mr Blair had become a liability to his own party.  "The Prime Minister has this naive view that the more he explains the constitution the more people will come round. But the reverse is true. The awful thing is that he has become a handicap."  The battle with the Tories will switch to the Commons today when Mr Blair reports on the summit.  Michael Ancram, the shadow foreign secretary, accused Mr Blair yesterday of ignoring the British people, who were against the constitution by a clear majority. Some Labour and Tory MPs believe Mr Blair was delaying the referendum in the hope that one of eight other EU countries expected to hold referendums will vote the constitution down.  Robert Kilroy-Silk, the former television chat show host who won a seat in the European elections for the UK Independence Party, likened Mr Blair to Neville Chamberlain, Britain's wartime Prime Minister, and his appeasement of Hitler.  "There's Tony waving a piece of paper saying 'It's OK, I've only given a little bit away of our sovereignty' when in fact this is the beginning of the end of Britain as a nation state governing itself."

      Horror and anger swept the United States yesterday after Islamic militants beheaded Paul Johnson Jr, a 49-year-old grandfather from New Jersey, who had been kidnapped a week ago from his home in Riyadh.  His corpse was later found dumped in the al-Munisiyah district, a rural area of farms and villas 25 miles north-west of the capital, Saudi security sources said.      An image from a video showing Paul Johnson in captivity  The militants - calling themselves "al-Qa'eda in the Arabian peninsula" and the "al-Fallujah squadron" - released gruesome video images and photographs of the killing.  Still photographs showed a severed head, placed on the back of a body wearing an orange jumpsuit, the face turned towards the camera. A dagger rested on the corpse, its point apparently buried in Mr Johnson's forehead.  They released a statement on the internet, claiming that the killing of Mr Johnson - an aeronautical engineer employed by Lockheed Martin, working with a Saudi manufacturer of high-tech equipment for Apache helicopter gunships - was just vengeance for the suffering of detainees abused in Abu Ghraib prison, outside Baghdad.  It added: "The infidel got his fair treatment. Let him taste something of what Muslims have long tasted from Apache helicopter fire and missiles.  "As we promised the mujahedeen, we have beheaded the American hostage Paul Marshall [sic] after the deadline that the mujahedeen gave to the tyrannical Saudi government."  The kidnapping of Mr Johnson sparked unprecedented public appeals from moderate Saudi clerics and lawyers, saying that he was an invited guest to the country, protected by Islamic law.  One Saudi colleague of Mr Johnson, using the pseudonym "Saad the believer", said he had often invited the American to his home for dinner, and given him books about Islam as presents, and invoked the traditional tribal protection over him, known as ijara.  If Johnson is harmed, the Saudi wrote: "I will never forgive you, I will curse you in all my prayers."  The kidnapping triggered a fierce debate on prominent Islamic websites. One senior Saudi cleric, Sheikh Abu Bassir, re-issued a religious ruling stating that foreigners arriving in Saudi Arabia on valid visas should be protected.  The extremists behind the killing had demanded the release of hundreds of al-Qa'eda suspects from Saudi jails, setting a 72-hour deadline that passed yesterday afternoon. They also demanded that all Westerners leave the Arabian peninsula.  Mr Johnson was the fifth Westerner to be killed in Saudi Arabia in just over a week, including two other American defence contractors and a BBC cameraman. Late last month, 22 people were killed in a two-day shooting spree at a residential compound for foreigners.  Though Mr Johnson's wife, sons and relatives in the US begged President George W Bush, the Saudi authorities and even the kidnappers to save his life, family members told reporters that the impossible nature of the terrorists' demands left little doubt he would meet a horrible death.   Colin Powell, the United States secretary of state, called the killing "barbarism", and predicted that it would reinforce the Saudi resolve to crack down on militants. Last night Saudi police shot dead three suspected militants in Riyadh.

      LF commander Samir Geagea's prison conditions in Yarze have been improved and a new medical checkup proved him in good physical shape, the Beirut media reported on Tuesday. The latest checkup a few days ago was conducted in Sacre Cœur Hospital. Judicial sources pronounced the outcome of the tests satisfactory and said doctors have recommended additional vitamins to his meals, An Nahar said.  The doctors also had no objection to the daily exercises Geagea undertakes in his prison cell or at the prison courtyard. This led to extension of the exercises from one hour to 90 minutes a day, An Nahar said.   The time frame of the weekly visits of his wife Strida was also extended from half an hour to a full hour, and increased form twice to three times a week.  Geagea has been held in solitary confinement at the prison of the Defense Ministry compound in Yarze for 10 years thus far. This made him the longest-held political prisoner since the end of Lebanon's 15-year civil war in 1990.  An ongoing campaign by LF activists to win back his freedom is believed to be hinging on whether President Lahoud's term would be extended or a new president would be elected in Lebanon by next November.

      Israeli warplanes have attacked south Lebanon after shrapnel from Hizbullah anti-aircraft fire rained down on military positions straddling Jewish settlements on Israel's northernmost flank, re-igniting tensions on the last active Arab-Israeli warfront. Lebanese police and Israeli army spokespersons said no casualties were reported on either side of the frontier from the sudden flare-up of hostilities that came hard on the heels of U.S. orders to Lebanon-based Americans to stay off Hizbullah strongholds in south Beirut and south Lebanon.  The warning notice that was posted by the State Department on Saturday had aroused fears in Beirut that the Bush administration maybe anticipating a major Israeli offensive against Hizbullah military bases in south Lebanon and command headquarters in south Beirut.  The air raid on suspected Hizbullah anti-aircraft batteries between the Lebanese border towns of Haddatha and Tiri was staged late Sunday night, about three hours after Israeli fighter jets patrolling Lebanese skies came under anti-aircraft barrages form south Lebanon.   The Israeli army said shrapnel hit an army position close to the Shlomi border settlement, warranting the swift retaliation by the air force although there were no casualties from the falling shrapnel. Israel had rarely struck in the past unless there were injuries among Jewish settlers.  Hizbullah said enemy jets fired four air-to-surface missiles in two runs on the strip between Haddatha and Tiri, causing bush fires and shattering window glass in the two townships.

      BroadSoft announced that Ericsson and BroadSoft have signed a global OEM agreement to integrate components of BroadSoft's BroadWorks(R) technology into Ericsson's IMS based Engine Multimedia 2.0 (EMM 2.0) solution. This integration will enable service providers for the first time to use the same platform to offer a uniform package of advanced managed communications services across wireline and wireless networks based on the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) architecture.  Ericsson will market the EMM 2.0 platform with integrated BroadWorks technology as part of its Softswitch offering, which is based on the 3GPP architecture. With this solution, Ericsson's customers will be able to deliver multimedia services, including hosted PBX, IP Centrex, residential broadband and collaborative conferencing services, transparently across different networks. The integration of the BroadWorks media and application servers into EMM 2.0 is based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP.) It follows the architecture developed for 3GPP that will be used in next generation fixed and mobile networks to provide multimedia services regardless of location.  "Today's announcement marks a major step forward in the evolution of uniform multimedia service delivery to fixed and mobile 3GPP networks," said Deborah Workman, vice president of market research at Dittberner Associates, Inc. Ericsson is uniquely qualified to provide this converged offering given their leadership position in wireline and wireless networks."  "By working with Ericsson, we're helping operators to keep their core technologies and investments in place, while enhancing their ability to offer hosted multi-media services across multiple networks based on the 3GPP architecture," said Michael Tessler, CEO and president at BroadSoft.

      US : With more than forty operators already delivering advanced mobile services to customers in 22 countries and territories across Asia, the Middle East and Europe, 3GSM is asserting itself as the global 3G standard.   Delivering a wealth of innovative new services to consumers such as video on demand, high-speed multimedia and mobile Internet access, 3GSM exploits the potential of content rich information and communication around the world.   3GSM also brings substantially enhanced capacity, quality and speed of data transmission. Incorporating a radio interface based on Wideband-CDMA, 3GSM is the 3G-upgrade for GSM, developed jointly by standards bodies from China, Korea, Japan, the United States and the European Union.   3GSM is the technology choice of 98 percent of operators who have been granted spectrum in the 2GHz band identified by the International Telecommunications Union for 3G. As 3GSM rolls out across the world, customers in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Australia are already enjoying its many benefits, with launches to follow in Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan this year. In addition, Indonesia and New Zealand are moving toward launch.   “All 70 networks that will be delivering 3GSM services by the year-end are utilizing the 2GHz band in which China intends to deploy 3G,” said Rob Conway, CEO of the GSM Association and a member of its Board. “Only one operator anywhere in the world has so far deployed an alternative 3G technology in this band. This global commitment is fundamental and demonstrates where economies of scale in the 3G market will be found.”   Growth is expected to accelerate from the current 3GSM global customer base of more than five million, as the number of commercial networks increases to at least 70 by the year-end and handset launches by all the world’s leading manufacturers eliminate supply issues.   “The greater availability of 3GSM handsets in China’s 3G trials programme is a further reflection of 3GSM’s superior maturity in the 2GHz 3G spectrum available in China,” said Conway.   Craig Ehrlich, GSMA Chairman and board member of Hutchison Mobile, said: “The opportunities for China with 3GSM are immense. Operators benefit from international roaming and economies of scale; manufacturers gain equal access to global markets; IT, software, application developers and content players are not locked out as in other systems, and ultimately consumers enjoy value from a greater variety of globally compatible products and services. These benefits can only be delivered by an open system and a non-proprietary philosophy.”   Made up of board-level representatives of 21 operator groups, including the world’s 12 largest operators by subscriber count, the GSMA Board met this week in Beijing to acknowledge China’s contribution to the success of GSM, and to demonstrate the Association’s commitment to supporting China’s Government, operators, vendors and customers during the transition to 3G. China Mobile and China Unicom both sit on the Board.   The world’s billionth GSM user was connected in February 2004. China’s unrivalled contribution to this milestone was reiterated when the Chinese GSM user base passed the 250 million mark in April.   “The impact of GSM in China has been profound,” added Ehrlich. “It has been the primary driver of mobile penetration and has propelled China Mobile to the status of the world’s largest mobile operator and China Unicom to the number three position. China Unicom’s GSM customer growth in 2003 exceeded that of its CDMA network. Also during 2003, China’s GSM users made a staggering 585.4 billion minutes of voice calls and sent 131.2 billion text messages. GSM accounted for 93% of Chinese mobile revenues.”*   China alone has more GSM users than the global customer base of the next most widely used mobile technology - CDMA. China Unicom’s GSM customers base is bigger than the combined customer bases of the world’s three largest CDMA operators – Verizon Wireless, China Unicom & SKT.   “GSM is unique among mobile technologies in having a clearly-defined user benefit – international roaming – at the heart of its design,” said Rob Conway. “Roaming creates a discipline amongst operators and their suppliers to comply with open standards, promoting inter-operability and creating economies of scale that benefit end-users. 3GSM builds on this heritage.   “3GSM is changing the mobile world. Users in Japan and Korea will benefit from improved roaming services as their deployment of 3GSM brings them into the GSM community. There will also be wider economic benefits as their manufacturers will gain greater exposure to the global GSM/3GSM market, concluded Rob Conway.”   “As we look toward the Beijing Olympics of 2008, the opportunity for China to serve a worldwide audience, and many millions of inbound visitors with compelling next generation mobile services has never been so apparent,” concluded Craig Ehrlich.
