      woah! juz got back frm X chalet.. n man.. im feeling really shagged! haha.. had lotsa fun dere, eating, playing.. n.. my omost favourite.. gossiping! haha.. had lots of everything dere! neway.. it really was great 2 c so many pple frm d same CCA gathered at 1 grp.. it helped in d team bonding.. haha.. dere was of course certain tense moments such as tt when Kenneth got drunk.. wah lau.. made all of us ah.. got on tip toes lah.. was so afraid of saying d wrong thing.. u could cut d tension wif a knife! hmm.. well.. everything was getting better when Kenneth went 2 d toilet.. until.. Lucas had 2 say smething wrong lah! wah lau.. its not really his fault n its 4 kenneths concern tt he said it.. but.. boy oh boy.. did it set d bomb off! Kenneth quickly flew in2 a rage n nearly beat Lucas up! aiyo.. so damn scary lah.. but.. Elayne, Zhi Yang, Elizabeth n me.. kai si lah.. pretend.. den 'continue' playing mahjong thruout d whole drama! but.. constantly keeping an eye on d movie! haha.. neway.. den... found out dis really huge scandal btw 3 X seniors.. aiyo.. its so complicated! i seriously give up thinking abt it lah.. neway.. it was so great tt i did not slp a wink at all! haha.. neway.. thruout d whole nite, i guess, i was able 2 take sum quiet tym 2 think things thru in my mind abt my life n well.. mainly my feelings 2wards d 2 gals.. Reina n Meiyi.. haha.. i noe tt both of dem is able 2 read my blogs online.. but i guess.. its d best possible way 2 xpress my concerns n thots tt i've got at d moment of tym.. neway.. after sum thorough thinking.. i've finally come 2 d realization as 2 y m i so confused.. basically, i lyk both gals so very much.. 1 since 2 yrs ago, n d other, juz dis yr yet she has made a strong impact on me.. well.. i've gotta admit tt both r really special gals in my life tt i would gladly hv taken as my wife.. however, d problem is tt i've no idea, who is it tt im gonna choose in realtiy.. well.. im really confused coz i've nv been able 2 find out wads was Reina's feelings nor her impressions of me! it is dis particularly dis uncertainity tt has made me so pessimistic abt dis relationship as well as made me hv so mcuh confusions.. y? coz.. simply, i honestly dunno d stand of Reina.. indeed, it is a near miracle wish 2 pray tt Reina lyks me 2.. but.. d qs is.. does she? i dunno n i dun think i ever will b able 2 make her lyk me.. Meiyi however is easier in d sense tt she juz tells me how she feels abt me n her problems.. 4 xample, oready beginning or d year, she told me tt she wanted 2 complete her 'O's b4 we had a chance.. while i study my best 4 my gd results.. thus im waiting patientiy 4 her.. n by giving me a stand, she has in tt b value n presented a clear line as where i stand in her heart n in her life.. it makes things easier 4 both of us as it has enabled me 2 establish where n when 2 X d line.. however, d thing is tt Reina has not given me any clue of how she feels abt me or her thots abt me.. coz i really lyk her alot.. yet. its d uncertainty tt has made me feel insecured n super afraid tt if i were 2 go wif my heart, i would get really heart broken when i get rejected.. wadeva it is, i will do my best in everything lah.. including dis relationships.. but d 1st thing i hope 2 accomplish is establish an understanding wif Reina so tt i noe at least where i stand in my life.. do take care ok.. get a gd rest 2day! Jia You! Live Life To The Fullest! *Hugs*

      Haiz.. 2day, I juz attended a funeral of my relative.. it invoked a lot of fond memories tt I had spent wif her.. thou they may hv seemed sparse n few.. yet.. all so very dear 2 me.. d funeral was so very solemn.. n it made me think of another funeral..  It was d funeral of my grandfather juz 6 mths ago.. dis memory touched d sentimental side of me as all those memories of my grandfather n me simply flowed back 2 me.. it was a sad n depressing memory as we had such great tyms 2gether.. I miss those tyms tt I had wif him.. he was a jovial man n was upbeat everyday tt I saw him.. full of memories n an abundance of energy.. it was simply wonderful 2 hv him arnd.. even in his 80’s he was lyk a kid in so many aspects tt made it a wonder 2 so many..  Upon hearing d news of my relatives passing a few days ago.. it made me go thru memories n hv flashbacks of beautiful memories wif my grandfather.. dis made me very moody n touchy as it took me a long tym 2 get over his death n 2 hv history repeat itself.. it was simply 2 painful 2 bear.. wad made it worse was d fact tt Meiyi had juz gotten attached.. it was more painful den ne other xperience of let dwns.. n.. it affected me a lot.. dis 2 things coupled wif d fact of changing classes as well as d stress I’ve got 2 undertake in CO.. made it all d worse..  Im so very sorry n would lyk 2 apologise 2 all those tt I’ve put off during those past few days.. I noe tt I was hard 2 get along wif as I was moody, touchy, eccentric n juz unreasonable.. so.. I juz wanna say.. Sorry.. I was oso simply insensitive 2 others n their feelings.. I feel really bad 4 it.. n I hope tt u’ll all accept my apology n 4give me..  I now degrade myself as I try so hard 2 cope wif my studies n my CCAs.. its really quite stressful.. as I keep myself occupied wif Chinese Orchestra n X Country.. it’s a hell lot of wrk 2 keep up wif slp n those leading me 2 b pretty grumpy at tyms.. haiz.. rite now, d J1 committee of CO is busy wrking on a welcome tea 2 every1.. hoping 2 interest more pple in joining d Chinese Orchestra.. hopefully tt our hard wrk pays off.. really wan more pple 2 join.. but.. I dun wan Kelly 2 leave either.. I think I’ve seriously grown 2 get 2 attached 2 her as I feel so strongly abt her.. hope tt I can sort out my feelings soon..                                                            Its here I sit,                                                           Sad & deprive,                                                           Waiting for help to arrive.                                                            Its here I lie,                                                           Wishing & wanting,                                                           Just down and hoping.                                                            Its here I stay,                                                           Watching & hearing,                                                           Looking out for her...

      Here I m back again.. after so many things tt hv happened over d past 2 days tt I’ve not written nething.. hmm.. I guess.. its quite upsetting considering tt most of dem r sumwad bad n depressing lah..  well.. lets juz put a gd thing 1st lah.. I juz recent;y watched a Midsummer’s Night Dream put up by d ACJC drama! Haha.. well.. it was.. simply.. fantastic! Haha.. they were really great! Hmm.. xpecially commendable were d J1 cast of Laura who played Hermia, Jonathan who played Hermia’s father as well as Andrew who played the King of d land (no.. not d king of fairies!)! haha.. they were really fabulous! Xpecially Laura who was 1 of d leading characters! She was simply fantastic n hardly any weaknesses were shown in her play! Haha.. hmm.. Jonathan was pretty gd too! Haha.. he was damn funny during d dances 2! But.. he has improved tremendously since d last tym they showed it 2 us! Haha.. even Andrew who had fairly a lot of lines 2 speak was fluent in his speech wif hardly any mistakes! Simply wonderful n happy 4 dem! D other J1 members of d play r not lacking either! Even thou some had minor roles or simply danced.. I think tt they hv done a simply gd job! Congrats 2 every1 involved in d play! Haha.. hmm.. well.. yeah.. I got 2 noe more abt my class again.. but.. I’ll get 2 tt later lah..   oh well.. now.. sumthings tt I simply hv 2 whine n let out off my system! 1st of all.. I hate 2 say it lah.. but.. im pretty upset regarding wad Natasha has been saying 2 me.. I mean.. I noe tt she is saying out of gd will.. but sumtyms.. its quite blunt lah.. recently oso.. I realise tt she has been pretty moody n tired.. really hope tt she takes care of herself.. I mean.. coz.. studies r really imp.. n if she continues lyk dis.. she mite get a burnout.. n it will by no means benefit her lah.. hope tt she would b able 2 rejuvenate herself n b more active in class!   Hmm.. 2nd of all.. im not all tt happy wif sum person in my class lah.. im not gonna say who is it at d moment lah.. but mayb later on as I move dwn my blog.. haiz.. well.. I’ve heard sum pretty bad comments abt him oready.. n.. its quite bad considering tt we r all in d same class u c.. I dun wan it 2 affect d whole total class cohesion.. if not.. aiyo.. d nxt 2 years would juz b hell lah.. well.. He has been really negative abt lotsa stuff.. u noe lyk.. jacking d teacher.. complaining abt teachers being 2 young n how much they suck.. well.. I can’t say much 2 those facts tt they r young n mostly inexperienced lah.. but den.. I think we should give dem more tym.. n let dem adapt better.. furthermore.. dis teachers hv oso contributed much 2 d recent yrs results whereby we’ve done relatively well.. so.. I think tt they r not all bad.. juz let dem teach d way tt they do n clarify if dere r any problems lah.. it doesn’t help 2 constantly complain abt dem.. hmm.. well.. I’ve oso kinda heard abt dis person blatantly juz telling sum gal tt he thinks she is ugly.. well.. im at no pt of passing any jurisdiction.. but.. all I can say tt.. its not a crime 2 hv personal views abt other pple.. but in dis case.. it was really 2 blunt 2 take frm ne1.. d way its done.. mite as well juz take a knife 2 stab d person or smething lah.. coz.. it hurts other pple’s feelings n well.. I guess.. it shows how insensitive d person is.. so I hope tt in future.. such comments b kept 2 demselves or they juz talk abt it 2 pple they r sure dunno abt d person u r talking abt so as 2 avoid friction n conflicts.. coz.. oready a no. of pple hv been put off.. I noe tt im not tt great either.. but im trying 2 accommodate others so has 2 built a healthier studying n schooling environment.. so.. lets juz give each other tym n b tolerant.. but if ne problems any1 has wif me.. I juz hope tt they r open 2 me coz im open 2 criticisms n suggestions.. howeva.. juz dun b so dwnrite blunt n unfeeling abt it lah..   well.. 3rd thing tt is d most upsetting thing im most upset abt is tt.. Meiyi juz got attached! Well.. I really dunno.. juz really dunno wad 2 feel regarding dis matter lah.. dunno how 2 xplain how I feel either.. xcept tt im really sad.. more sad den I’ve ever felt b4.. as in.. I purposely didn’t wanna go after her or nething coz she has her ‘O’s dis yr n I wanted her 2 concentrate n wrk hard.. yet.. I guess it backfired lah.. allowed her 2 get 2gether wif sum1 else.. even thou we nv noe how she’ll respond 2wards me even if I did go after her.. but.. its still  really hurting lah.. oh well.. yeah well.. juz wished tt I actually did smething or made an effort 2 go after her lah.. but.. I guess.. d fact tt I wan d best 4 her.. juz.. overwhelms everything else.. so.. yeah.. neway.. juz wish her d best lah.. I can’t do nething much regarding d matter nemore.. haiz..  I think im quite doomed in d terms of Love loh.. aiyo.. my gfs so far hv either been really problematic.. been 2 intolerable lyk my ex.. or.. they simply juz.. dun match me nemore.. haiz.. den regarding gals I lyk.. its even worse lah! Shit loh.. wah lau.. its either, they r attached oready, dun wanna get attached now.. goin overseas.. im not their type.. lost their feelings 4 me.. or juz.. can’t b wif dem lah.. aiyo.. it really damn sad lah! Shit man.. well.. no matter wad, live goes on n I guess.. all these r part n parcel of life.. so.. juz move on.. mayb I’ll wait 4 Meiyi or juz find sme1 whom.. I dunno lah.. c 1st..   hmm.. it was quite awkward meeting Kelly lah.. aiyo.. d 1 frm CO is d 1 im talking abt now.. well.. its lyk.. at 1st didn’t noe wad 2 say 2 her.. whether 2 greet her tt kinda thing lah.. I juz wish I knew how she really felt abt me n whether we hv a chance 2gether lah! haiz.. well.. my class.. oso.. got a lot of pple lah.. I mean.. I lyk sum1.. but im not really sure how she feels abt me.. actually 2 lah.. 1 is.. starting wif C.. d other is Michelle.. but guess which wan lah! Haha.. well.. I dunno how both of dem view me neither do I noe how they feel abt me..   I juz wanna noe every1 better 1st.. Xpecially those 2 gals! neway.. its quite funny how much u can feel 4 a person lah.. I mean.. well d 1 starting wif C.. I oso not sure how I feel 4 her lah.. in my eyes, I think she is quite great.. but I fail 2 understand y sum pple tt noe her dun lyk her.. hmm.. guess.. every1 hv their own preferences lah.. I juz hope 2 lyk.. understand her n talk 2 her more 1st.. well.. im oso quite worried abt Kelly frm CO loh.. plz dun let her quit lah.. dun wan her 2 quit! She is really very imp 2 d CO n at least let me sort out my feelings 4 her 1st leh.. its damn screwy lah.. well.. yeah.. I mean.. tts all I can say rite now regarding my feelings rite? Haha.. its damn sad lah.. Michelle Wong is attached.. haiz.. so.. she is 2tally out of d qs.. den.. Rebecca..

BASKETBALL!! haha.. yup! basketball.. finally, after hesitating for so damn bloody long.. i decided to join it! haha.. funny? yup.. i guess so lah.. considering my lack of height.. but hell.. i am going to try anyway.. but.. not aiming to get into the team, cause i got to settle my own team 1st.. heex.. ooh ooh! finally getting back my form.. at least for shooting that is.. but.. my speed, steals, lay-ups.. passes are still not up to standard.. crap lah.. really must work on them again.. oh please give me the strength and endurance to do it well!!!  haha.. yeah well.. regarding.. my love life? hmm.. nothing much lah.. or rather.. prefer to keep it quiet.. no point blowing it up again right? haha.. but crap lah.. am feeling the need to work damn hard for her.. really.. want to make it and do well.. yup.. hmm.. so.. i am going to give my best to convince her.. heex.. anyway.. yeah.. if it works out.. i'll put it up.. or.. we'll see how lah.. haha.. but.. even though my love life is quiet! haha.. i found out so many many scandals.. surprisingly, most of them come from the AH classes lah! haha.. but.. ssh.. heex..  ok.. got to go liao.. need to start work again.. before i die horribly.. take care yeah! haha.. smiles!

      Finally I am back to blog again! Haha.. it certainly has been a somewhat long period of time and well.. I guess.. lots of things have happened.. good things.. and.. well.. nevertheless there are also bad times.. I not really sure what is going on in my mind.. haiz.. so.. let’s just lay it all more or less bare and hopefully I would be able to think clearly with time to come..  Hmm.. well.. 1st of all, I am happy about the recent NBA results! Haha. Finally, then Lakers are back up there and in 14 years, the Pistons are finally up there again too.. but.. seriously, I don’t ever think that the Pistons can ever beat this present Lakers team.. it’s true that their defence is the best in the league.. but hell! Lakers has like 4 legendary players in their team! The best center in the league in O’Neal, best power forward, Malone.. crap.. with veterans like Payton and the present generation Jordan in KOBE BRYANT! Do you honestly think that Rasheed, Ben and Rip can ever beat such a wonderful team?! Haha.. well.. NO! the ending of the playoffs shall prove it all! The Lakers will endure and win the Championship for the 4th time in 5 years!  Haiz.. the school holidays has finally reached and well.. though it certainly has been much anticipated and much awaited.. I’ve been really tired and I guess.. somewhat stressed.. crap lah! It’s so damn different from the Secondary school system.. whereby in the holidays still can slack at least 2+ weeks.. now.. have to have PW meetings, school remedial and trainings for both my CCAs ever so regularly.. it’s so damn tiring trying to juggle all the obligations and duties.. it’s going to be hard to settle.. oh.. I pray to God that he gives me the strength and energy to survive this whole school year! Damn.. Basketball training is like how cool lah.. though I was in for a rough start, not doing up to expectations, I am happy that at least now I have coped more or less.. made new friends.. the whole team is even more bonded than CO lah! Crap.. even though there are many new intakes for both CCAs, crap.. I feel more comfortable in bball than in CO lah.. the camp ain’t doing much either loh.. as in the CO camp.. the overall IC for this camp is just.. so.. alamak! Can’t find a suitable word to describe lah.. not that I personally have a problem with him.. but rather.. many people are unhappy with him too.. just.. they don’t there to speak up against him.. cause.. he is.. extremely STUBBORN and.. DOMENEERING!!! I bet he is like a D or something like that for his damn DISC personality.. crap.. let’s leave it as that lah..  Well.. let’s see.. School work has been quite fun lah.. though I haven’t really gotten down into studying for my terms but rather.. I’ve just briefly studied a little bit.. just like glimpse through.. just don’t feel like doing any of my holiday assignments at the moment.. they seem like diseases that I don’t even want to touch with a damn bamboo pole lah! Crap.. oh well.. anyway.. so many people are having camps or are overseas.. seriously wonder how people are actually going to complete their work.. I bet most of them would be likely rushed during the last week of this holiday terms.. sian don’t you think? Oh well.. think I’ve got to start somewhere soon.. haiz..  Haha.. oh! Guess what! I am super happy that my basketball basics has improved.. or rather.. people have told me so.. in the bball team, I’ve learnt new things as well.. so.. hopefully with more time, I’ll improve as well.. and apply them or incorporate them into my team trainings.. haha.. I finally beat Baey soundly! Hmm.. he was training for National team lah! Haha.. I am so happy! Heex.. just a few days ago, I beat him 5-0.. now our win records stands at 3:2 with me leading by 1! Haha.. anyway.. I’ve got to work more so that I can be much better than what I am presently..  Ok.. let’s see.. I can’t really think of anymore to say lah.. except regarding my feelings for HER.. I mean.. I really don’t know lah.. I do know more or less how she feels about me.. but.. I am not going to say lah.. but.. I feel like I am not doing enough to deserve any thing at all from her.. well.. let’s just say that at the moment, I am at my wits end.. am so very tired.. planned something to do with her.. yet, I am afraid that she or I will not be free on that particular day.. besides, at the moment, I’m having a somewhat problem with cash flow.. parents are being really strict about my cash stuff.. haiz.. I don’t know.. I hope that all these problems would sort out soon enough.. cause.. well.. yeah.. I really like her a lot.. and.. just really wish that we could get together lah.. I know I sound really desperate.. but.. I guess.. everyone who thinks this is right.. I AM desperate.. not to get just any girl, but rather desperate to win the heart of this girl whom I have seen as THE PERFECT ONE in my life.. nevertheless, I will not give up.. will keep trying.. I pray for blessings and good luck.. cause.. I am hoping that we 2 really work out.. yeah.. and I dare to swear lah.. that I am being truthful about her.. man.. I don’t know leh.. I think I am being overly sensitive or something.. at times, I think I really shouldn’t dwell to much into this feelings.. cause, the more I ‘spend time’ with her, or rather.. as time passes.. the more I fall deeper into my feelings for her.. well.. I also realised this lah.. I have friends who suan and jack me all the time, and well.. I know they are joking, so I don’t take it to heart.. but somehow or another.. I think it’s just me being sensitive.. but when she jack me or suan me, I will start to think things true as well as process the whole thing before I really brush it off.. I don’t know since when did whatever she think of me become so important and vital in my life.. I realised that I hold her opinion as the number 1 to me.. why? I guess, it’s simply because, that’s how much she means to me.. a person that I can’t not care about nor can I go about without thinking of her.. haha.. crazy? Mad? Yeah.. simple over her.. but.. I need to control this emotions.. really need to.. otherwise.. the whole thing may simply fall through, and.. she and I would just end up as nothing.. something, that I sincerely don’t want to see happen.. cause.. yeah.. I wish we would work out..  Ok.. I think that is enough for right now.. so.. I got to go already.. Live Life To The Fullest! ;p
