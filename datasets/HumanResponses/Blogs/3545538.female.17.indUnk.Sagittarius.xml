        **~So I am totally new here..everybody seemed to get one of these thingies so I decided to try it out too.So yeah..well lets start off with a little on me and who I am.~**   I was born on December 7, of the year 1986, in El Paso, Texas...that city close to the border. I used to live in Juarez, Mexico though until the age of like nine then I moved to my so called no-town..Chaparral, NM. Yep don't be amazed if you dont know where it is. I didn't even know it exsisted until when I moved there. I used to hate it. I used to hate it with a passion. Living in the city and going to a desert was totally weird. Very weird. I thought I would never get used to it! how could they not hive a little store a block away!! Then I started a new school and made friends easy. Thats when I thought it wasn't that bad. I made so many friends..they were so open and so not conceited. I had come from a private school into a public one and it was two different worlds. They didn't care what I was wearing, or what brand my tennis shoes and school supplies were. They liked me for who I was, and they didn't expect me to make some awesome party or anything like it. i was there for about hmm...let me remember two years..then it was back to the private school I had now learned to dislike. I had to wake up at around 6 in the morning to drive (well my mom!) all the way to that stupid school! I how much I disliked it! It realy was horrible. one of those years I wish I could just get out of my memory. Everybody was so fake and backstabbing. It was like if I was living in a typical blonde girl movie. The thing was that they were all Hispanic!!! SOOO that year ended then back again to a public school. I was back on track with all my old friends and OH it was the best year of my non-High School days! It was just awesome! I was so excited that the next year I was going to HS. Wow HS, and with all my friends and buddies I had learned to love! But NOO!! My parents made the horrible decision of going to another private school. And that one I disliked even more. I was like the only Mexican in like a High School (weird since El Paso is like, about 75% Hispanic) that consisted of 25 people. Scary..they all thought they were superior to me. But I didn't let my guard down..I always kept going. Then relief came as I entered the HS I had been longing for.. Gadsden High. It was awesome..my old old friends and a huge school! With Mexicans! Yippie! It was the best three years ever! And that, brings me here..I am now official High School graduate. I graduated on May 14th..and so I enjoy these beautiful vacations which I think wil be the best vacations ever..or so I think.  **Note** Graduation was about three weeks ago and I am now in Dallas, TX visiting my sister..hmm... best vacations ever eh?
