        So there I was in my underwear leaning over my loudspeaker. A spoon scotch taped to the flat, oak veneer top, the only stable item in the room. The desk, the dresser, the desk chair, all covered with papers and books. In fact, the speaker was the only stable thing that had its surface exposed and still I had to tape the spoon not because I shook but because I was afraid that I would shake.  I hadn't showered in several days.   It was 4 am and I was slimy from eating nothing but a bag of Doritos, a few cans of Budweiser and a pint of Hagen Dasz earlier in the day.    I had been chain smoking cigarettes that I had purchased with old silver quarters. I was sweating hops and nicotine.    In the room next to me the floor was littered with small bits of discarded tissue paper, a filthy oriental rug, more spoons, books, several bags of trash, Q-tips and a refrigerator.   It seems like ages now but its been less than 10 years since that night, though time is so meaningless in all this. I had, by my own volition, arrived at the most remote outpost I had yet to visit. It took me a good 20 years to burn my wick down far enough to see that I was in a dark place. I hope that you do not have it in you to imagine the place.   I clung to the belief that I could find my way out. That it wasn't so bad. I only needed a 'leg up' to get going again, a small turn of luck. Perhaps if I went to graduate school? Have you ever watched a crab in a terrarium struggle to get onto a rock, only to continue the climb against the slick glass slides of the box it is in? Any hopes fanned  by these whims were quickly extinguished and despair, defeat, humiliation, shame rushed in to fill the vacuum. Over and over this drama repeated itself in my life cycling here on the hour, there every five minutes, then a day off, then a day on. Random, insufferable, unstoppable. I was slowly losing the ability to pretend and the reality of my aberrancy was becoming inescapable.   I laid back on the bed. The sun was rising. It was already hot. I stuck to the sheets.  My head ached under my unwashed hair. I could hear birds outside my window. I cursed them and then I cursed the sun and finally I cursed God. I was at the jumping off point. Despair and disbelief fueled me                 How could you let me sink this low you fucking asshole?        I have pursued you diligently all of my fucking life.        I have prayed to you as Christ.        I have read your fucking Buddha teachings.        I studied the Bhagavad Vita.       I read the Koran!       I have spared no expense and have been relentless.       I have always, fucking ALWAYS, turned aside the attacks        of those who say you don't exist.        I have loved you the very best that I can.        Isn't that enough?? What is your fucking problem?        What am I supposed to do?         WHAT DO YOU FUCKING WANT FROM ME??        I had never spoken this way to this...this thing I had been pursuing all of my life, since before I could walk (I remember). I had been afraid to because I picked up along the way that it was a sin to curse Him. It was in the Bible. All writing and talk of Him was done with reverence. A shroud of reverence had always covered me when i listened to my father talk about Him.   But nothing happened. The harangue trailed off. Nothing. Only a slight relaxing, a slow release of the despair and then the voice, stern and unmistakably clear like the bell that used to call me back from recess, "LIMIT YOUR WANTS!".    I remember clearly that i was lying on my back in bed. I was turned slightly towards the wall and my left arm was over my eyes to block the damned sunlight. i watched these 3 words as they hung in my mind for a moment, then two, then....they hung there. they were not pushed out by the chatter nor by the cursing nor by the general brew-ha-ha going on inside me.  I got up from my bed, pulled open the shower curtain, pushed the glasses, plates, forks aside with my foot and took my first shower in a week. Thus I advanced a very little ways up this hill.

      I spent about an hour on my brother-in-law's deck on Father's Day playing a 1/5 size fiddle (my neice's). I couldn't help myself. A 3 year old and a 9 year old improvising dances to Soldier's Joy, Oldtime Reel and other old timey tunes played horribly but in time at least. The 3 year old put her hands on her hips and did something very close to what I've seen the irish step dancers do even though she has never seen them and came over here from China. I don't know what that means but it is one of the things I can point to when I say this music creates community when it is played. I guess playing well matters little.  The next day my left arm was pretty sore. My thumb is sore as well. I've also noticed an occassional pain in the first digit of my index finger, which only forces me to press more lightly on the string which I should be doing anyway. I've heard it said the lighter the touch the better and I have been flailing away for 3 years like an unattended garden hose. Not to mention a steady diet of coffee, latte and a couple of small lopsided (nutritionally speaking) meals during the day. It seems the world corrects me if I listen. These things I get and do form me, instruct me. There's wisdom in these old things even though no one shows me personally or reveals their lessons outright for me. A thing as old and prevalent as the fiddle has a way of its own. It requires that I make some changes to my assumptions if I am going to have any success with it.

      My voyage began several years ago and I have been remiss to send home letters. It is my prayer that with this blog I am able to rectify my sins of omission.   These are dispatches from the pup tent of my mind. In here they are most luminous but cast against the dark night of the world they will soon be lost amidst the trees and stars and all the other what-nots that impede the flow of light, the general lack of amplitude admittedly being the foremost reason for their stunted trajectory. I make no promises or claims.  Father's Day is winding down in New Jersey. Fantastic weather went wall to wall. Pa got a card and a Border's gift certificate from me. I was the only one who brought a gift for him. I cohabitate with my family, though not for much longer. I have railed long enough at those in the culture who tear families apart and send them scuttling across continents to eek out their livings from Ma & Pa Corporation. After I get the bulbs in the ground I am moving further west come the autumn months. The economy is improving, my company appears to be growing as are my programming skills,  (and the clincher)  the idea hit me that perhaps, after all these years, Ma &amp; Pa might enjoy the settling in with the tribe members scattered...even if only a few miles off.  So I break to you, gentle reader, the news of my plans to depart over this threshhold at the tender age of 41 for a not-so-distant-place in a not-too-distant-future.    This entry has been brought to you by the talented makers of Ritalin LA.
