      I never really thought I liked Gus. The guy I was dating ~ and who would later become my husband ~ loved this creature like a son. I am an animal-person but Gus was hard to take. The dog never shut up. He was a 70 lb monstrosity who dropped coarse white fur by the pound. I swear the tendrils were barbed ~ they would attach themselves to all fabric with the tenacity of fish hooks and the curling pattern of pubic hair. He demanded attention, hated it when I snuggled close to Marc and let me know just how he felt with his constant whine, whine, whine. Gus blasted squeaking sounds out of his nose with every exhale when he was nervous, excited, hungry, wanting to relieve himself or just plain didn't like the way things were being handled by us humans at a particular moment. What's more ~ he annoyed my sixteen pound chihuahua terrier mix, Libby Lu.  Libby Lu ~ I call her Lu ~ has travelled the United States with me. I actually found her on the beach in Puerto Rico. I lived in Punta Santiago for three years, studying the behavior of rhesus macaque monkeys which lived on an island, free-ranging, a mile off coast of PR. The poverty in Puerto Rico does not lend to proper vet care of companion animals. Cats and kittens run in feral hoards throughout fishing villages, grabbing what they can off of fishing docks and out of restuarant bins. Dogs and puppies fare far worse. Canines don't seem to possess the self sufficiency felines do when faced with homelessness and human abandonment.  Daily, puppies and dogs would be abandoned at the beach - our beach - and we would watch as the confused animals learned how to scrounge out a living. Us researchers always tried to help the dogs . . . but the problem was bigger than we were. We'd administer mange shots to help the poor infected dogs who lost all of their hair and would burn and peel, naked to the sun. Eventually, they would become crusted over with the infection. Other dogs would get hit by cars, some would be posioned by restuarant owners, sick of having whining animals block their patrons' entrance and exit. But the worst fate to befall the dogs of Punta came at the hands of the fishermen.  Punta Santiago is an impoverished fishing village. It lies in the southeast corner of Puerto Rico, near Fajardo and on the Caribbean Sea. The waterway between Punta and the island where the monkeys live serves as a migration channel for hammerhead sharks. Catching one of these "tiburones" is an honored feat for dock fisherman. And, as I learned, there is no better way to catch one of these carniverous fish than to have bleeding, squirming bait. Hence, the puppies.  Every morning and afternoon, we ~ meaning the American researchers ~ would take a small boat to and from the monkey island. Every morning and afternoon, we would pass the local fisherman as they set up to fish for the day. It is a terrible thing to watch a grown man take a precious puppy, machete off a leg, wrap the screaming little babe with fishing line and then toss the creature out to sea, to either swim/bleed to death or to lure a shark.  There are some things that one can toss his hands in the air and say, "I can only do what I can do about a situation." The amputee puppies was not one of those situations. Us researchers began grabbing litters of abandoned puppies away from fishermen and tear-assing down the beach. Sometimes we were chased . . . but we never lost a puppy.   What did we do with so many pups? We went to the biggest resorts where the richest, whitest tourists were -- we told our story about our "tiburon perros" and found homes for all of the dogs. And this is how I found my Libby Lu. She was alone and shaking on the dock. Sitting trustingly next to a fisherman who was sharpening his blade. I grabbed her and ran. She was matted with dried feces. Something about her spoke to me and I decided that I would keep her if she would have me. She didn't object to my presence and we have since formed a very strong bond.  Libby is the first dog with whom I have ever shared space. She is small and polite. Quite portable. So, when Gus entered my life, I was exposed to a whole different definition of dog. I have to say, I didn't like it.
