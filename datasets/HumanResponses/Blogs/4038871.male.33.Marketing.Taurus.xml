      Having posted all of these today, I have been reminded of another incident that I don’t think I sent an email about at the time…   K the departmental assistant had brought in a copy of Dalton’s Weekly or something similar, as she was looking to buy a car. We had 5 minutes spare late in the afternoon and we were flicking through and came to the Adult Services Offered section at the back.   There was an advert for the ‘correction services’ of an older woman and in her picture she was dressed as a policewoman. &nbsp;The woman in the picture looked just like J, the PA to one of the directors, who was brilliant fun and would see the funny side of it.&nbsp; I took the magazine and colour photocopied the page. The first copy didn’t come out but the second did and I went back J’s desk and put it on her desk.   The first photocopy did end up coming out, but I ddn’t find out about that until the next day. The Land Director’s PA, who was very sweet, but blessed with Swiss efficiency and an Austrian sense of humour, found the print out and, for some reason known only to her, went into the MD’s PA (ginger matting for hair and lips that have sucked too many lemons) and apparently quite innocently asked if the print out was hers.&nbsp; The MD’s PA was shocked and was more than quite indignant that she had asked.&nbsp; I wish I had been there to see her reaction.

       May 2003: Where the Sun don't shine      Just when I thought that I had slipped into the Bonkers PLC ways and that nothing was going to shock me anymore, which I have to say was a bit of a worry, something has just happened to make me realise that I am normal and this company should be the subject of a BBC2 documentary...   About 15 minutes ago I was talking to one of thesenior architects at his desk about some floor plans. His phone rang with an internal ring and as he was in the middle of something I picked up his phone and answered it, "A's phone." Our esteemed MD then launched into a 2 minute tirade  of foul abuse, calling me everything under the sun andfinished off by telling me that "I could shove my plans up my fat a*se as they were a load of f*cking sh*t anyway and that's where they belonged".   I kept quiet during his 'speech' and when he finished Iasked him if he wanted me to come into his office to discuss the plans.   Realising he had got the wrong person, he was taken aback for exactly 1/3 of a second and then said "Nick, I'd like you to tell A exactly what I just said."   I then had to hold the phone so that MD could hear me say to A "...and MD would like you  to put the plans up your behind as they're not very good..."   Who do I contact at the BBC to get the cameras rolling?

       2 June 2003: Permanent job at Bonkers PLC    My boss just called me into a meeting to persuade me&nbsp;to take the Marketing Manager position permenantly. She told me that I could name my price. I gave her the attached document. She more than saw th efunny side of it, she completely understood.   Attached document:   In the current economic climate I am grateful for being offered a permenant position at Bonkers PLC, but will be unable to accept for the following reasons:   Only red paper clips are allowed to be used, but there are other colours in my drawer – this is patently asking for trouble   There are not enough mugs in the kitchen for the staff, but you are only allowed to bring in plain white mugs – this does not allow for any individual expression of creativity through Forever Friends branded items.   The standard contract hours are 8am – 6pm and you cannot leave a minute before 6pm. I have a cat and the vet has the same opening hours, 8am – 6pm – this is a disaster waiting to happen the next time Malcolm becomes ill.   The managing director has a habit of talking to people like they are dogs – I can only go to the toilet standing up and not on all fours with one leg cocked.&nbsp;   You tend to have to run around like a headless chicken focussing on senior management’s priorites at a whim. I would get confused whether I was supposed to be a chicken or a dog.&nbsp;   The Chief Executive got in his car and came up to our offices from the Marketing Suite to tell the Managing Director, who told the Head of Sales (this is beginning to sound like Chicken Licken isn't it?)&nbsp; who told the Marketing Manager who told the Sales Team that the candle holder needed to be removed from the ensuite bathroom – this is a terrible waste of senior management time when there are other inane details to focus on – see above.

       31 May 2003: Bonkers PLC - Correspondence with suppliers    One of the PAs down in the site office sent a stroppy letter out to one of our suppliers last week (textbelow).&nbsp; The Site Manager obviously signed without reading it. They have the radio playing in the site office and someone wasn't paying attention to what they were typing. I cried when I read it...   Dear Sir,   Re:&nbsp;Bonkers Wharf - A3/A4 panels   We are concerned that your labour has decreased to zero on your panel works when your work is so far behind programme and you have informed us of further delays. A3 panel work has stopped presumably due to lack of materials and/or JGW incomplete works.   You have informed I wish that you could see me now and see how much I have changed, I love you so much that it hurts and I can't seem to believe that you will no longer be a part of me anymore us panels including corner panels are still in manufacture and these are  critical to instillation.   We require a full written breakdown of missing materials and their delivery dates by return fax.   Yours faithfully etc

       30 May 2003: Thank you for the invite    Sorry to bombard you again, but I recived this fax from one of the guests who attended the launch party last night. Re-reading it I'm not sure if it's from one of the guests or the senior management. You just couldn't make this stuff up.   Dear XXX,   Thank you for inviting me to the show apartment today. I left early as I had seen most of it and it looked like you were going to have a busy evening. It has a nice view and would be quite suitable while waiting for the Penthouse or a combination of two of the Georgian houses on Imperial Crescent. The keys can still be posted to me (or couriered) if that's ok with you.   I have been dealing with a few problems, the most important of which was trying to find&nbsp; someone very special who I lost sometime ago. It looks destined to become the Queen Elizabeth/Sir Walter Raleigh tragedy. There seems to be an overwhelming need to use reverse psychology (business language) in all situations which has proven destructive so far and I am  afraid I keep playing or allowing the outcome they want.   The number 12, for example has significant meaning and it's about midnight now. But most&nbsp; important is family. Whatever they decide they win (I am outnumbered many to one) but she knows the truth. She has a lovely name, but it's elusive. Maybe it's beacuse I haven't been up to her standards and let her down more than once. It's my conditions. Anyway, I'll accept the keys in the post (or couriered) to the show apartment on the 9th floor preferably on Saturday.   Good luck, although I suppose you don't really need it, you seem to be doing quite well. I spoke to J (Head of Sales) the other day and her voice sounds remarkably like the person on the Eurostar radio advert "J'aime le train." (Pardon my French).   Thank you for eveything.   Yours etc

       30 May 2003: If you're not on the list you're not coming in...   &nbsp;  Bonkers PLC launched one of the new penthouses last night with an exclusive party for invited guests only -2 bedrooms, medium sided balcony, but does have an integrated wine cooler - £950k...   The MD, CEO and Chairman (our holy trinity) were allcoming, so everything had to be perfect and run likeclockwork for the 6pm start. You just know what's coming...   5.55pm  The site guys were still painting, fixing the floors and a leaking shower until 5 minutes before the first guest arrived. Amazingly they managed to finish andget out without anyone seeing. So far, so good...   6.00pm  Downstairs two doormen, hired in for the evening,&nbsp;direct the guests into the lift and up to the 9th floor, where we are waiting to hand out canapes and champagne.   6.02pm  I realise that the two gas torches, also hired in for the evening&nbsp;at the entrance have not been lit and run downstairs to light them.   6.07pm  Using one of those contraptions to light a gas cooker I get the gas torches alight.   6.09pm  I go back up to the penthouse in the lift with some of the guests, hiding my right hand, which is completely black and there is a strong smell of scorched hair.   6.11pm  I get a call from Hamptons, the estate agents, to say that the doorman is being rather zealous and has turned away 3 of the invited guests.   6.13pm  I run back downstairs to tell the&nbsp;doorman to let people in, to find him telling current residents of the development that if they're not on the list, they're not coming in. A quick word in his ear to remind him of his brief and everything seems ok. I head back upstairs.   6.19pm  I have a call from the doorman to say that a removal van has turned up to the entrance and new residents are dragging their furniture along the red carpet to the lifts. Black bin bags and a sack of cat litter on the red carpet is not a good look.   I go downstairs to find out why the management office have booked in a removal when we are having the most important event of the year so far. Getting out of the lift, I step over a rather nasty chest of drawers that is in bits to find the MD, CEO and Chairman getting into the other lift with the new arrival, his girl friend, 4 black bin bags and a cat. I pretend I haven't seen them.   9.50pm  The rest of the evening having gone without incident, I am driving along the Embankment, almost home and looking forward to a drink on the terrace.   I suddenly have one of those "OhmygodIcan'tbelieveIdidthat" moments. I got rid of the final guests at 9.15pm, locked up the penthouse and took the lift down to the underground carpark.  It's only as I pass Blackfriars, 30 minutes from the site and 2 minutes from home, that I realise I forgot to stop off at ground level and tell the doormen that the event is over and they can go home.   8.15am this morning  I have a call from the security company to tell me that the doormen were there until midnight, but it really had quietened down from about 9.30 onwards...

       23 April 2003: Don't eat unwashed fruit    Welcome back to Bonkers PLC after our short Easter break.   Things have been quiet and I thought it might be a while before I got the opportunity to fill your day with joy that you don't work in the same company as me.   Luckily, after a slow start yesterday, events have overtaken me this morning. I just popped into the kitchen to make some tea and made the happy discovery of a whole new set of plain white mugs for general usage.   This made me think that I may have been alittle harsh in my judgements of Bonkers PLC and perhaps I just hadn't been here long enough to find the real warm cuddly bit of the company  that was just shy and hiding itself away.   I started to make some tea and small chat with the MD's PA about what colour would she describe her hair colour as I had always found it intruiging - (apparently it's Burnt Rust - maybe not the most glamorous way of describing the orange matting that&nbsp;perches on her head).   Anyway, she was washing some grapes for the&nbsp;MD who has a lunch meeting with the Chief Exec. The Chief Exec walked in and said to her:   "C I hope you're washing these well, as I don't want to be eating them unwashed if one of the natives has pissed on them."   I am on the path to trrue enlightenment at this place.   Next installment soon no doubt.

       17 April 2003: Silence is golden    I've just been told off for talking.   Katie, the departmental assistant is off to New York next week and was asking about places she should visit.   I mentioned Century 21 and then&nbsp;our boss&nbsp;turned round and said "Do more work children, it's not lunchtime yet."   We had been talking for a grand total of 30 seconds. I am now going to see if I can get through the day without talking to anyone.   The witch hunt is still on and I know who it is. I might see if there is a reward going and shop the  culprit.   Am looking forward to next Wednesday, which is St Geroge's Day. I hope that Bonkers PLC will be doing something patriotic and completly nonsensical, like making us all wear chainmail made out of red paper clips.   Have a great Easter and there will no doubt be more news from Bonkers PLC next week.

       16 April 2003: The witches of Salem, SW6    When I get around to leaving here, which, please God will be soon, I will be quite disappointed  as I am not going to have the material from Bonkers PLC to regale you with our 'fun' times here.   However, I'm sure I'll get over it.   After yesterday's meeting, which was the first one where anyone has ever said "nipples" to me, I thought it might be a few days before anything else came up that was worthy of being put down on paper. How short sighted I was.   As of 9.28am this morning we have a full blown witch-hunt going on and there are a lot of people  running scared right now, and so they should - we are all under suspicion.   Our esteemed&nbsp;MD came out into the middle of the office to make an announcement.  Someone has dripped tea down the side of the new (plastic, wipe-clean) bin in the kitchen, through careless disposal of a tea bag. This is not the Bonkers PLC way.   We have a new bin and a new kettle, as well as thefloor having been bleached and the grouting cleaned.&nbsp; And this is how we have shown our appreciation - tea stains. It's really not on and whoever it was really needs to own up to this, as otherwise we are going to have our tea bags taken away.   There are a few key suspects and there is a lot of finger pointing. I think I might start a whispering campaign against the MD's PA. I'd quite like to see her sitting on a three legged stool in the local pond.

       April 2003:Week 7 at Bonkers PLC   &nbsp;  Hurrah, back at work at Bonkers PLC for another week of "The Office" style lunacy.  My boss is out of the office all week and I have just had a call from the MD to tell me that I have to print off every email I receive and photocopy all post and faxes I receive to give to him.&nbsp; There's nothing like a good old fashioned control freak is there?   I wonder if I will have a chance to get any work done this week or will I just spend my time informing him of the work I could be doing if I wasn't blocking up the printer printing off emails. As they're emails, couldn't I just forward them to him or his PA?   Apparently not.   I might also let him know what I'm having for lunch in case he has some advice to offer on my nutritional intake.   Enjoy your week - I'm really looking forward to mine...

       15 April 2003: Spring has arrived at Bonkers PLC and the MD is feeling frisky   &nbsp;  If you no longer wish to receive this weekly newsletter from Bonker PLC, please reply with  Unsubscribe in the title.   During weekly marketing meeting after the account manager from our external PR agency has left the room, the MD says to&nbsp;me and my boss:   "Well, what do you two think of K? I'm not impressed. She looks like shit. She is not glamorous and she should be if she is in PR, don't you think? No tits, no make up and ginger hair. L, will you have a word with&nbsp;T (who runs the PR agency) and tell her that K needs to sort herslf out if she is going to retain the account. I know K's from New Zealand, and they're all outdoors types there, but what the fuck does she look like?"   Me: "MD, now about the new advertising..."   MD: Yeah, Don't use the same girls as last time they were shit and this time I want them in knickers and bras.."   Me: "But the shot is of them going for a walk through the development by the new parkland&nbsp;alongside the river"   MD: "Yeah, Janet Raeger, lots of nipples, right."   Me: "Right, well I'll have a word with the agency and see what they can come up with. How about short skirts?"   MD: "Nipples Nick, nipples."   Me: "Okey, dokey."   MD: "Right, now&nbsp;where is my costing for the optimised penthouse units in A3 and A4?"...........

       2 April 2003: It was the chief executive in the ensuite with the candleholder    Life here at Bonkers continues apace and I have settled down into a happy rhythm of eagerly awaiting what Tom-foolery the management will come up with next. Luckily I never have to wait too long.   Once upon a time...  The Chief Executive went to the show house at the marketing suite down on the development thismorning. He walked around checking on fine detail, as  the senior management like to do here.   He went into one of the ensuite bathrooms and saw a candle holder  that he didn't like. He came back down the stairs and  past the Sales Team, who work on the ground floor of the Marketing Suite, got  in his car and came up to our offices to tell the Managing Director, who told the Head of Sales (this is beginning to soundlike Chicken Licken isn't it?) who told the Marketing Manager (me), who&nbsp;phoned the&nbsp;Sales Team back down at the MArketing Suite that the candle holder needed to be removed from the ensuite bathroom upstairs.   A much better use of everyone's time would have been for the Chief Executive to pick up the offending candle holder and take it to the ground floor of the show house where the Sales Team work and give it direct to them. It might have saved the Managing Director, the Head of Sales and Marketing and&nbsp;me five minutes of their day to devote to other inane details.

       27 March 2003: In trouble again    It was all just too good to be true. I knew it would  have to end before too long. I am in trouble again at  Bonkers PLC. After a week of using the right colour  paper clips and the right mugs and glasses I've just  had a telephone call from the Chief Executive  Director's PA.   The call was to thank me for the press relases that I  had sent through to his office for sign off and to  point out that in future I should not send anything  through to his office in a brown envelope - only white  will do. I wouldn't mind, but the CEO doesn't even get  to see the envelope, his PA does.   Next time I'm going to send press releases through  wrapped up in clingfilm

      19 March 2003: Forget drinking vessels, stationery is what's important round here   Mugs and glasses pale into insignificance compared to  this - I still can't quite believe it has just  happened...   I put the marketing packs together for the board  meeting for the first time this morning. They were  handed to the Management Team&nbsp;before they were needed and all of the  information was completely correct. Now, take note of  these two facts - they are important.   Fifteen minutes ago I was called into the board room  and all the packs were handed back to me by the Chief  Executive and I was told to go and make sure they were  correct and then to bring them back.   I brought them out to the Head of Marketing and asked  what was wrong with them, as we had checked all the  information was correct.   Can you guess what was wrong - I never would, but here  goes....   I had used the wrong colour paper clips to put the  packs together. No, really.   Only red paper clips are allowed and I had used a  number of different colours from my desk tidy. What I want to know is if we are only allowed to use red paperclips, why do I have a desk tidy full with paperclips that cover the full colour spectrum?&nbsp; I think whoever orders the stationery rouund here should get the boot.   Good to see that the senior management are focussing on the really important stuff.  I think I shall remain speechless for the rest of the day.

       14 March 2003: Another drinking vessel incident   &nbsp;  This job is the equivalent of working at Faulty  Towers. Following the (still talked about) incident  with me and the Land Director's mug, I find myself in  the middle of another drinks related crisis.   We only have bottled water here, as the site is on the  old Gas works and not all of the land has  been cleaned - God knows what the water is like for  the residents of this development. However, in the office there are  roughly 6 glasses for 40 staff. This afternoon I gave  up my glass to the Head Surveyor, not wanting to  appear recklessly selfish with the few drinking  vessels that there are here.   About 10 minutes ago I was feeling rather thirsty, so  went into the kitchen and got a botlte of water. Came  back to my desk undid the bottle and took a swig.   BIG MISTAKE.   I've just been told off by the MD's PA. "We  don't allow staff to drink out of the bottle here  Nick." She did't take it too well when I started  laughing. What am I supposed to do, collapse from  dehydration?   I can't wait for Monday to see what that brings....

      A year ago I was doing some freelance work as a Marketing Manager for a property developer in West London; let’s call them Bonkers PLC, to protect the innocent, i.e. me.&nbsp; I worked there from February until July 2003. The development being&nbsp;built -&nbsp;'Bonkers Wharf' - was very high spec and&nbsp;not cheap; people paid a lot of money&nbsp;for the apartments, which makes what went on behind the scenes even funnier.   As you will find out from the following posts, my time there was sometimes fraught, but I did manage to see the&nbsp;amusing side of what was a rather oddly managed company. When things got too ridiculous I would send an email update to friends about what was happening.&nbsp;   One of those friends suggested that I start a blog with the emails. It’s taken me a while to getting them up and a friend had to resend them to me as I hadn’t kept the originals. I have just re-read them and they really made me laugh – it brought it all of the lunacy back to me.&nbsp;I just have to remember that at the time I couldn’t get out of there quick enough...     13 March 2003: Issues facing serious consequences    &nbsp;  War in Iraq? The state of the housing market? The fact  that&nbsp;Bonkers PLC&nbsp;are really quite behind in their  building schedule? NO - The big drama here is tea cups  and mugs.&nbsp;   Yesterday I was 'caught' attempting to use one of the  MD's cups by the MD's PA.&nbsp; I didn't even realise it  was one of his, but it quite obviously was, since by  the telling off I got, you would have thought I'd just  crouched over his desk and crapped on his Montblanc  pen.   Then, this morning, I made a cup of tea in a mug I  found in the general mug cupboard.&nbsp; I was half way  through drinking it when the Land Director's PA came  up and told me that he had seen me use his mug and had  asked her to come and get it. &nbsp;She took away my cup  there and then - half full.   You would think in the current housing market and the  fact that this development is only half built that there would be more pressing things to concentrate on. Obviously not.
