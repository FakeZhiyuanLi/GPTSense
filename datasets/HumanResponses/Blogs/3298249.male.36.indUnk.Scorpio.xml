        [Ed. Note: This is the first in a rebroadcast of The Bachelor Chronicles in a shameless attempt to backfill my blog with interesting posts. This episode was originally broadcast May 2, 1997. Let it be known for the record that The Bachelor is much, much more mature these days.]   When we last left the bachelor, he didn't know whether Ms. WithAPulse was just really young for him or someone who would have to call Shirley Temple "ma'am". Here is an update on recent activities.   The Plan  After one full day of wrestling with this, I came up with three plans.   Plan A  Just ask her. No one does this, so it's on to   Plan B - The Transitive Inquiry  An old classic which has evolved from caveman times - "Me Grog. You Biscuit. He Goog. You like Goog?" - to jr high - "Hey Jessica, Joey wants to know if you'll be his girl" - to bachelorhood. Basically, you want to find out information using someone else, without letting the subject know they're providing information.   Ingredients:  - One Transitive Agent, in this case, my workout partner, who goes to the coffeeshop with me - A good script   Pros:  Properly executed, this is the king of all information gathering   Cons:  One smartass Transitive Agent can do more damage in 10 seconds than battery acid.  In my case, I knew that my Transitive Agent could very well abandon the script and say "Hey. The Bachelor wants to know how old you are, it's driving him nuts."  Plan B aborted.    Plan C    The Stereogram Approach  For those who don't know, stereograms are those posters that look like a bunch of random colors, but once you look at them the right way you can suddenly see a ship or an eagle or some chick's birthdate...  The idea here is to bury the real goal within normal conversation, such that the subject doesn't realize what they're telling you.   Ingredients:  All this really needs is a good script and a little luck. The script wasn't a problem, but as you'll see, Lady Luck was a bitch.  Background: The last time I'd seen WithAPulse, she was with her 1 1/2 year old nephew.   Script:  Obviously there will be a little paraphrasing here, but in general, the script would go  During the course of normal conversation... B: Did you have good time with your nephew? W: blah blah blah I don't really care what she says as long as it implies "Yes" B: You sure looked pretty comfortable playing mommy... W: blah blah blah I don't really care what she says B: How old are you? W: The eagle in the stereogram is revealed! B: Geez. You're young! You've got plenty of time before you have to worry about that!   Note: It's always good to end with a joke. That way they don't have time to think about the fact they've been duped.  So armed with this script I went boldly into Starbucks...   Wednesday:  Code 69: Mission Abort. WithAPulse was at home sick.   Thursday:  Things never work out as planned.  The conversation went like this: During the course of normal conversation B: Feeling better today? (Always imply you actually care) W: I can't remember what she said. Who cares anyway.  [Customer walks in]  BP: Did you have good time with your nephew? W: I can't remember what she said, but it implied yes  [Went to help the customer]   Great - some customer comes in right at the crucial moment of the conversation! Now the script is worthless, since without asking during the normal flow of conversation the true intent is revealed.  I tried to think up a new approach, but given the lame original script took me the entire previous day, I had writer's block. I kind of stood there for a while, until I crossed over from standing around to actually loitering. I needed a way out of this.   Fortunately, my workout partner skipped out on the workout, so I knew he wouldn't be in for coffee. I waited around for a couple of minutes, and then asked "Hey, have you seen the guy I normally come in here with this morning". They said no, I accused him of standing me up and made a quick exit.   Friday:  Code 69: Mission aborted. The place was packed and I had to be at a 9:00 meeting.	  Looks like I'll have to try and actually have lunch with this person and find out her age during a civil, adult conversation. Hopefully there won't be any police around to arrest me when she starts singing  On the good ship, Lollipop

       I don't know what it is with baristas - and bartendresses for that matter.   I think the problem is that I have a weak spot for an attractive female smiling at me and saying "Can I help you?". I always want to say "Yes, and I'll have a latte too".  I've been going to Starbucks for many years, as I'm sure you've gathered from my last post  from seven years ago .   Anyway, last week I met a couple of friends at an un-franchised-latte-joint-I'm-not-naming-so-I-can-keep-her-for-myself. We're about to leave when this woman came out of the backroom.  I can only assume that someone who knew me saw me walk in and requested this woman be created in the backroom. Tall. Long, dark hair, fit, smiling from ear to ear.  There was only one thing to do. Talk to her? Are you kidding?! I need to find out her schedule!  So I've been going there every morning for the last week with no luck. I was about to give up, but I went in this morning for one last time.  And there she was. Beige micro-miniskirt. Tan. Brown shirt that said "Brunettes have more fun". I walk up to the bar and she smiles at me and utters those immortal words:  Can I help you?  I've officially changed coffee shops.

        [Ed. Note: This is the first in a rebroadcast of The Bachelor Chronicles. This episode was originally broadcast April 30, 1997. Let it be known for the record that The Bachelor is much, much more mature these days.]     Prologue     The best laid plans...  I was totally committed to quitting the daily Starbucks routine, when in January I noticed one of the baristas was kinda cool. Let the journey begin...  Getting to know this girl was not going to be easy task. It would require patience and an excellent memory on my part. Why? As anyone who has ordered coffee at Starbucks knows, there is only about 30 seconds between order and pickup - not a lot of time to get in my A-list material. Any information that was obtained during this interlude would have to be retained, analyzed for information and used to get more info the next day.  Fortunately, I'm a devious guy, and this is how I do things all the time.    Carbon14 Dating   The most troublesome thing for me was that I couldn't get a good feel for her age. She's a small, petite woman (girl?) who appears kind of shy. I didn't know her very well, so I had to be creative.  Fortunately things played out pretty well here. One Monday she mentioned that her dog's birthday was over the weekend. I asked how old the dog was, she said   12  . The next day I brought up her dog and during the discussion asked how old she was when she got the dog -   11  .   11+12=23  -&gt; Badabing!  Note that depending on when during her 11th year she got the dog, she could be closer to 24. I'm 29, so this can be taken as me rationalizing a potential cradle robbing.    Cahones or no Cahones, that is the question   Actually, this is a no brainer. Remember that  urlLink Mariners pitcher that got hit with a line drive right in the family jewels  last month? Well, if that was me it wouldn't have done any damage.  Isolation here is key. Can't ask her out in front of the whole damn world, including her coworkers and any dope whose in line for a cup o' joe. So I found out when she got off work and strategically placed myself in the parking lot.  No problem - lunch next week.    But Wait!   So I'm telling my friend about this last night, and I mention how I got her age, thinking I was some sort of sauve genius. Just off the top of his head he asks &quot;What if the dog was, like, six when she got it?&quot; Let's do the math:  11+12 -  (6, dog's age when she got it) = 17   That giant sucking sound you hear is my entire belief system imploding on itself. OHMYGOD - I'm Tony Randall! This obviously was an angle I hadn't considered, so I needed to know, unequivocally, this woman's, or girl's, age.    The Plan   After my friend stopped laughing hysterically, we hatched a plan. Once I found out her age, I would page him. Instead of typing in a two-digit number signifying her age. For example, if she's 24, I page him and instead of typing my phone number I'd type in &quot;24&quot;. In for some reason I didn't get the information, I'd page him and enter the mission abort code - 69.    Epilogue   The reason I haven't detailed the plan is that she wasn't there today, resulting in an aborted mission. All I know is that I'm freakin' out, expecting the police to come by and arrested me for cavorting with a minor. In the meantime, the dentist says my teeth are getting coffee stains, but I can't do anything about it until I get some closure here. And the expense! Three bucks a day to talk to someone for 30 seconds. You guys should be buying Starbucks stock, because I'm singlehandedly contributing to record earnings next quarter.  As for how this ends up, stay tuned...

       On Saturday I went to  urlLink A Prairie Home Companion  at Marymoor Park, which was awesome. If you've never heard of it, you can hear it on  urlLink KUOW  Saturdays from 3:00pm - 5:00pm, and it's also rebroadcast on Sundays from 10:00am - 12:00pm.   Anyway, there were about 5000 people there, and I didn't see one attractive woman. I suppose that's to be expected, since most of the NPR crowd is either 95 years old or so far left the women show up with their girlfriends wearing hemp clothes.  After that it was off to my cousin's high school graduation party. Two observations. First, girls are WAY more developed than they were when I was in high school. Second, I wish I was in high school.  Was going to go out to the bars, but after spending all day in the sun my decrepit body was asking for sleep. Oh well, can't go out every night.  On Sunday I almost went to the dog park to troll for women but I didn't have the guts, since I don't have a dog.  I'm still trying to get the hang of this whole blogging thing, so I realize this is kind of a lame post. In order to pay you back for this loss of time from your life, I'm going to have my next few posts be from The Bachelor Chronicles Hall of Fame, back when instead of flogging yourself on a web site you'd do it in email.  Stay tuned - I promise it'll be worth the wait.

       Ah...The First Post. Well, given the nature of this blog I suppose it's only fair to describe myself in order to give you, dear reader, the proper context.   I will add to this post as I think of more things to use to describe myself. Here's what I have so far; if you want to know more mail me and I'll add it.   Vital Statistics  Name: The Bachelor City: Seattle, Washington Age: 36 (birthday: 11/12/67) Height: 6'4" Weight: 225 Hair: Dark Brown & short Eyes: Hazel Race: Caucasian Ethnicity: Half Italian, Half Croatian. All Adriatic, all the time! Sex: Not nearly enough   Non-Vital Statistics  Smoke: No Drink: Why yes, thank you! Relationships: Never been married Favorite Feature: Height Least Favorite: I'd like to have a nice strong jaw. Weird, I know.   Attributes of The Perfect Woman  Tall Long, straight, dark hair Smart Funny Sarcastic Sincere Romantic In shape   Dealbreakers  No Smokers. It's a digusting habit, and I've lost too many friends & family to cancer.  No kids (but wants kids). It's hard enough interviewing for the role of boyfriend. Let's not add father and husband on top of it.  No religious freaks. I spent my entire education in private schools. I think I deserve at least another decade of being secular.   Miscellaneous Facts  I routinely think I'm less attractive than anyone else does.  I'm told I'm hilarious.  Everyone thinks I should be a writer.  Given a choice between two women where the less attractive one was smart, I'd take the less attractive one every time.

       Work is intruding on the bachelor's blog time; apologies for the scarcity of posts.   I Have Reader!  I installed a site meter to see how many people come to my site. This was just out of curiousity mind you; I'm not vain, Carly.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered that my blog has been hit  twenty-nine times  in the last two days? I was totally shocked and more than a little happy.   Then I checked out the numbers on some other blogs and…oh. Twenty nine isn't very many.   FINE! I’M NOT DOING IT FOR YOU ANYWAY! I'M ONLY USING THIS AS A CREATIVE OUTLET, AND AS A MATTER OF FACT I DON'T EVEN WANT YOU TO COME HERE!   So there.   By the way, feel free to tell your friends about this blog. My goal is one hundred hits in one day, of which 99 cannot be from my machine.   Freak Alert  As both of the people who read this blog know, I'm now going to a new coffee shop because The Highlander Barista (so named because even though I love many baristas, in the end there can be only one) works there.  The last couple of days I've noticed a woman in line who looks vaguely familiar, and today is finally hit me who it is.  It's a guy I worked with in my old job.  Here's the deal. I was working with this guy, when one day he shows up to work wearing a sun dress. I thought it was weird, but hey - software developers are a unique lot, and maybe he was taken for a ride by some guy in Fremont claiming it was a kilt.  He continued to wear women's clothes, and eventually started wearing makup and talking in that I'm-trying-to-sound-like-a-woman-but-really-sound-like-my-balls-haven't-dropped pseudo chick voice.  Oh, did I mention the male pattern baldness? It was quite a sight.   Turns out that his wife went lesbian, and instead of divorcing her he decided to get a sex change so they could still be together. You can't make this stuff up.  I changed jobs shortly thereafter and never saw him (I'm sorry, but I'll always think of him as him) again, until yesterday. Looks like he joined the Hairclub For The Sexually Confused, because long blonde locks now frame his masculine face.   Truly a sight to behold. Behold, and then run from as fast as you can.  (I do feel sorry for their kids though. What the hell must they be thinking?)   IM Chick  I bragged yesterday that I she hadn't tried to get in touch with me for two weeks, so of course I get mail from her today. I'm playing poker with a bunch of her co-workers, and apparently they're going to put me through the ringer to find out about our relationship. This is not even close to a big deal since I haven't seen her in two months, but she used it as an excuse to mail me and include the fact that she's noticed I've blocked her on IM.  I'm in the middle of a stretch where I will have been on a date with a different woman every week for eight weeks - a once-in-a-lifetime stretch for me which I'll talk about at a later date - yet I still think about her.   I wish she'd leave me alone, yet part of me is glad to hear from her. It's very annoying.    Vacation All I Ever Wanted  I'm on vacation all next week and I don't plan on even walking by a computer the entire time. So expect more posts than usual.   What can I say. I'm a conundrum...an enigma....a mystery wrapped in a riddle.  And both of you love to read about it.

       Two weeks after changing coffee shops for the specific purpose of seeing  urlLink The Barista , I finally saw her again. I was fortunate enough to actually stand in line behind her.  Short, short turquoise shorts. Skin-tight top. She's as hot as a bucket of hot things. Seriously, it's ridiculous.   I'm not a believer in "leagues"; I don't think anyone is necessarily unattainable if you put your mind to it.   I think she might be out of my league.  Which is too bad, because I'm pretty sure she was made at The Bachelor Factory, specifically for The Bachelor. I can only hope that someday I am lucky enough to put one of those little pieces of paper in her pocket that says    Inspected by The Bachelor

        One Hour Photo    This is one of those movies where you end up wondering what could have been.   The story is about a 1hr Photo guy who gets a little too interested in the life of one the families who are regular customers.   Robin Williams is excellent; it makes you wish he'd do more  real  movies instead of the fluff he's been putting out over the last decade. According to the Charlie Rose interview on the disc (one of several nice features; the extras are better than the movie) he's pursuing more challenging roles, so hopefully this is the start of a trend.   At the end of the day it seems like all the effort went into Robin Williams' part and production at the expense of everything else. The supporting roles aren't very well fleshed out, the plot is transparent and it's pretty short (90 minutes not counting credits). I think they basically ran out of story and had to wrap it up.   This movie seems more like something from USC Film School than an actual movie.   I give it a C grade. It's really not worth a rental in my opinion.

       To the woman at Larry's Market,   Don't worry, I'll never tell your husband about it.   How you knew I was gawking and let me follow you, then came back to me in front of the fish counter when I stopped. I don't take offense to you trying to lure me into the feminine hygiene aisle in order to expose me for what I was up to; I appreciate your playfulness.   I appreciate how you adjusted your overshirt (who wears an overshirt in 80 degree weather?) to expose the tight yellow top that held your perfectly-designed-and-installed-breasts. It was nice of you to hold me in such high regard, even though you were apparently very cold.   You were obviously enjoying the attention, even though I got more a hint of a  Take a good look while you can, because you'll never get them  attitude.   Fortunately, you don't have to be present for me to win.   You see, now that I've seen you in all your glory you're burned in my brain. The way you carry yourself, the ponytail, your great taste in clothes and your amazing body are now firmly deposited in my Spank Bank, to be withdrawn repeatedly until such time that I have insufficient funds.

       It’s not that complicated.   First of all, people need to lighten up. And at the end of the day there are worse things than being single. If you look at 99.9% of the world this very instant I doubt you’d choose to trade places.   Take a look at your deal breakers and be honest with yourself. Are you being unrealistic? If so, pare down that list to include things that are important instead of what’s ideal.   Go out, do the things you enjoy, but make an effort to make yourself available to people.   Try to learn about them instead of trying to find out what’s wrong with them. Then, evaluate the total package.   If you see someone you’d like to talk to, the fact that you may never see them again is your biggest ally and biggest enemy: approach them and talk to them now or kick yourself over it forever.   And most of all, have fun. Life’s too short.

       I remember a time, long, long ago in a town far, far away – like, say Seattle until about the mid-90s.   People would date, learn about each other and then make a qualified judgment.   What do I like about this person?   What do I not like?   And most importantly, in the grand scheme of things, do the things that I like outweigh the things I don’t?   Some things were the same then as now of course.   Looks matter, for both men and women. Women like to say that what they want is for someone to make them laugh. If that were the case I’d be dead of a sexually transmitted disease. Ladies, when you tell your girlfriend that you’ve met someone, what’s the first question? Is he funny? No, it’s what does he look like? I won’t even bother with men; it’s a given. It’s not a big deal to admit that. Admitting it is the first step to recovery.  Things are different now on both sides of the snowball (for those of you not old enough to know, that’s a Skate King reference).   So what changed?   First and foremost, we’ve gone over the top with regard to our expectations of each other. Instead of getting to know someone and weighing the pros and cons over time, we spend our time analyzing every aspect of the individual trying to catch – almost hoping to catch – something negative so we can walk away.   Everyone has a list of “deal breakers”. Personally, my deal breakers are:   1. No smoking (it’s a disgusting habit, and I’ve had too many people I love die as a result).   2. Wants kids but doesn’t have kids (it’s hard being the boyfriend and auditioning for the role of husband without throwing the father audition into it as well)   3. No religious freaks (I went to all private schools, so I think I’m due at least another decade of secularism, thankyouverymuch).   Everything else is fair game. Now, are there other things that might cause me to walk? Of course. Still, there are only three things that are non-negotiable, don’t-even-bother items.   It seems like most people have a litany of deal breakers; so many in fact that one might ask “What aren’t deal breakers?”   Men are bad at this, but women are by far the worst. Ever read some women’s profiles on the online services? “I want romantic walks on the beach, to travel to exotic destinations, and to be the center of my man’s world”. Good luck with that.   Both sexes are horrible with regard to their expectations. The analogy I have, while geeky, is appropriate. Bear with me.   In some video games you can pick a character to play. As part of that character you can pick certain traits that they have. The catch is that can’t make every aspect of that character have 100% of every trait. Sure, you can make it strong, but in order to do so you need to take away some speed. You can make it beautiful, but you need to take away some intelligence.   No one has 100% of everything, yet we spend all of our time focusing on what the deficiencies are rather than how balanced someone is when taken as a whole.   Everyone is looking for Perfect instead of Perfect For Me, or more accurately Good Enough For Me. If there’s one thing above all else that needs to change it’s the perception that “good enough” somehow means “I’m settling”.   It reminds me of Seinfeld, spending our time obsessing because someone’s a Close Talker or has Man Hands.   “Women in Seattle are fat.” “American women suck.” “Men are too shy.” “Women don’t take the initiative”.   (That last one is news to me by the way. All of a sudden men expect women to be the aggressor? How arrogant have we become? Get some balls and do it yourself, chickenshit.)   Or as a friend of mine says: we’re trying to get a custom fit in an off-the-rack world.   So what do we do?

       In my opinion there is some merit to the theory that there quite frankly aren’t many single women here, period, and the older you get the worse it gets.   There have been a lot of comments on the relative attractiveness of Seattle women versus those in other parts of the nation and world.   Instead of fanning those flames I’ll simple say: assuming there are fewer women as a whole (and even census figures support this), it logically follows that there must likewise be a lower proportion of “attractive” women to choose from as compared to other cities.   By the way, this in no way implies that there are a lot of attractive men in Seattle. Being a man myself, I could look at a lineup of ten guys who were a mix of different levels of “attractiveness” to women, and other than the fat guy, the bald guy and the guy with black bean teeth I’d have no idea which was which.   That said, I’ve seen enough to know that there are plenty of ugly guys in town. Plenty.   So, in a nutshell, I believe that the main Seattle-specific “problem” is that there are simply not as many women as men, or at least I don’t know where they are. If there is some secret lair we don’t know about please do speak up.   As the title of this post implies, I believe that the male/female ratio is the secondary problem. What, then, is the primary problem?

        Why Am I Single?  I’m sure if you had a chance to ask, this would be your first question for me.   I went to a small college, one where everyone knew everyone else. I was extremely insecure and even more picky – a lethal combination. The end result was that I passed up a multitude of opportunities with women because I was chicken. The one exception to this rule was if I had a few drinks, in which case I forgot that I didn’t care what people thought    I graduated from college and busily pursued a career in tech. It was very demanding, but I somehow found time to go out on the weekends with my friends. I barely noticed when one, then two, then three of them married off. I was very fortunate to have a lot of friends in the area so I always had someone to hang with.   I can honestly say that if I’d married at 25 I’d either be miserable or divorced today. Fortunately, in my late 20s I finally grew up and started to realize what I really wanted, rather than what I thought I wanted. A happy by-product of this was that it improved my self-esteem; the self-confidence issues fell by the wayside.   By my early 30s most of my friends had married, and at the same time I started a new project which required 110% of my time for nearly two years.   Then one day I looked up. I was pushing 35, all my friends were married and many had children.   I’ve always been independent, but this was ridiculous. It was time to make things happen, instead of “doing the right thing” and “hoping it all worked out”.   I could go on, but I won’t. The real takeaway is this: at the end of the day, no matter how many excuses (legitimate or not) I come up with, I’m where I am because of the choices I’ve made.   Just like you.

        This a re-post of what I put on the Seattle Times dating forum web site last night.    Who Is This For?   These observations are most appropriate for people older than twenty five; if you’re younger than this you have nothing to complain about. Really, stop reading this stuff; it’ll mess you up. Go out and have fun.   There are several people – men and women – who obviously have other issues. Some have been hurt emotionally or physically in the past. Some are just plain bitter. You know who you are (hopefully), and this is not for you.   Finally, this is not for guys trying to get laid by as many women as possible. If that’s your goal go listen to Tom Leykis.   This is for the rest of us: men and women who are single, getting older, perhaps frustrated, yet still hopeful.   So read on. Or don’t. Feel free to comment. Or don’t.

       I went to a housewarming party on Saturday night, and on the way home I decided to stop by Barca on Capitol Hill to see the "scene". I've been told that it's a happening place, but I've been there twice before and hadn't seen it. On this particular occasion it was pretty hoppin though.  I went upstairs to have a drink and my sister was up there with her friends. I looked at her a couple of times and smiled, and she kept looking back at me. Maybe she was uncomfortable having her brother sitting across the way by himself? Who knows. At any rate, I left.   I called her the next day and asked her what the problem was, and it turns out it wasn't my sister. I swear, this woman was a DEAD RINGER.   Once my sister found out I was in a bar by myself she definitely thought it was strange. Then, when I asked her if she's busy this week and would she be interested in coming over for dinner, she asks me "Is everything ok? Do you have some sort of big announcement?". I jokingly asked if she thought I was going to say I was gay, and she says "Yea, because if that's the case it's not a big deal and you can tell me over the phone."  So there you have it: I've somehow made my sister think I'm coming out of a closet I've never been in to begin with. Go figure.

       I wasn't feeling like going out on Friday night, but at the last minute I had a girl friend (notice the space between "girl" and "friend") pick out a place for me to have dinner. I think I owe her a margarita or perhaps The Bachelor's Signature Drink: a Crown & Seven; Ten Mercer is just about the perfect restaurant for single people looking for good food and good views of the opposite sex.   I got there around 9:00PM, which is pretty late for me, but Ten Mercer skews toward the European tradition of a later dinner (should I call it supper?) so it was not a problem at all.   As fate would have it I got to sit next to three very attractive ladies which I naturally did nothing about. They were in a very deep conversation about the relative quality of each season of Sex and the City, so far be it from me to intrude. A cursory glance around the room indicated it was about half full, though I don't think the upper level was very busy at all.  I don't know if it was a slow night, but the service was so good it was almost uncomfortable. As soon as I entered I was taken to my table, had my coat checked and was given a glass of water. I was able to immediately order my drink, and as soon as I got it was asked if I was ready to order dinner. I ordered a glass of wine to have with dinner but they brought it right away, which made for the strange sight of a man sitting at a table alone with three glasses in front of him.   I had the following: 1 Crown & Seven: $6.25 1 Glass White Wine: $7.00 Garlic Crusted Pan Roasted Chicken: $18.00  The chicken was served with asparagus and roasted potatoes, and it was fantastic. One word of warning: if what I had was any indication portions are huge, so take note if you're not wanting to overdo it before a night of carousing.    Summary  Ten Mercer is a great place to start the evening, either with a date or by yourself. The service and the food is excellent, and the prices are reasonable. This is honestly the best new (for me) restaurant I've been to in years; the only thing I'd change would be to make it smokeless.  Location: 10 Mercer (duh), next door to The Melting Pot  Date/Romance Factor: 4 (out of 4). Beautiful Baby Factor: 3 1/2 Ages: late, late 20s to mid-30s. Value: 3 Quality: 4 Service: 4 Smoking: Yes, unfortunately  Overall: 3 1/2 (I'd give it a higher rating if it were smokeless, but I'm a serious smokeaphobe)  I might decide to make a permanent feature. That of course depends on you; let me know if you'd like these to continue, and by all means send your friends here to either read the review or give an opinion if they've been there themselves. And if you would like to see other information in the reviews let me know.

       Had another date that I met via an online service last night. I used to be really uncomfortable meeting someone blind, but I'm either getting used to it or getting desperate, or a little of both.  She's an ex starving artist (artiste?), who gave up starving and got into waitressing (quite the upgrade). She seemed really fiesty in our conversations so I was looking forward to meeting her. She was also tall, which as you know is a bonus.  Anyway, we met at the El Camino for drinks. Given how much some women stretch things with their pictures, this one was pretty good. I didn't have any trouble picking her out of the crowd, which is a good thing.  I always make an effort to do the listening instead of talking about myself because a) I already know about myself 2) I'm not one to talk about himself and iii) I know women appreciate it.  In this case I didn't have to worry. I don't think I got anything in after hello, but it was such a blur I can't be sure.  She's a nice woman and all, but it just wasn't there; no spark. I realized that I could appear to be looking at her but instead be looking at the table of very attractive women just behind her without her noticing (which it totally out of character for me), and at that point it was pretty clear that it wasn't in the cards.  Oh well - can't like 'em all. Back to the drawing board.    urlLink IM Chick  Update  I blocked her, but now she's sending me mail. It's weird; it's like the more I ignore her the more she wants to talk to me. I've always heard that this is what happens, but it's the first time I've experienced it.   Any time I can't decide whether to be flattered or annoyed I remind myself that the last time we went out she made me wait for her in my house for half an hour while she resolved an argument on the phone with another guy in my driveway. That usually clears things up.

       I should block her.   We met on match, over time exchanged email and instant messenger (IM) adresses and totally hit it off. We ended up going out for one intense month when she decided that things were moving too fast and maybe she wasn't totally over her ex of four and a half years. She was also getting a lot of attention from other guys, so she probably wanted to sow her oats for a while.   The frustrating thing is that she was the instigator the entire time we went out. She was all over me! I'm not used to that, but I got used to in in a hurry. Then, as quickly as we started we finished.   Of course, she wants to be friends. Get real. You can't demote a relationship from Nuclear Intensity to LJBF like that. I don't want to be her friend. I have plenty of friends, and if I have free time I'm going to spend it in pursuit of other relationships.   Yet she keeps popping in on IM. At least once a week. "How was your weekend? Blah blah blah". One day she said we should go out for coffee or a drink. I told her I was busy through the 4th and after that we should play it by ear and she got all bent out of shape. WTF?!   Cake, eat, discuss.  I told her I had a date on Friday, and lo and behold she pops in at 5:00pm Friday night, right before I'm ready to leave. Gee, nice timing. It's almost as if you want me to be thinking of you.  Oh, did I mention that even though we met online it turns out she works in my division? Two buildings down? Good times.  Relationships are a funny thing. When my friends are having trouble I give great advice. When I hear someone call in on the radio I know exactly what the host is going to say. But when I'm that friend...that caller...there's always a caveat. My situation is different. I know that's not true, and when I look at what I'm doing and say "You're an idiot - walk away!". But as soon as I step back into my life I find excuses to stay in contact.   Even though I should block her, I don't. I just delete her so I won't have to see her online, but she can still contact me.   And she will...she always does.   I'll be caught off guard, not want to talk to her. But I will.   I'll be charming and funny and everything she liked about me to begin with. And we'll make plans to see each other. And after we're done talking I'll beat myself up over having talked to her and caving like that.  And we'll go out and I'll buy her a drink. And if we have more than a couple of drinks we'll hook up again, even though I know I shouldn't.   But I will. Because my situation is different.

        [Ed. Originally broadcast May 5, 1997, this is The Last of the Past]   So there I was, visiting my folks and having a completely innocent conversation, when my dad gives me a little yellow sticky...   The Story  My dad is 75 years old and retired, and decidedly old country. From February - April 15th he works in downtown Seattle doing tax returns for low income folks, which until now I thought was ok.  Apparently he met some woman who has a daughter who is single. According to him, they have been "sharing stories" about their children for the last few months, and they both think that their kids need to get out more and are frustrated that every time they try and intervene the kids get irritated. Go figure.  So the dinosaurs decide that they're going to set us up. One day the daughter comes to visit the mother and the mother introduces her to my dino-dad. Dino-dad reports to my freakazoid mother that he deems her appropriate, so my mother digs into her photo albums and gets a picture of me as best man at my buddies wedding, which my dad then brings to work and shows his little friend.   Welcome back to Love Connection - I'm Chuck Woolery.   Bachelor, what happened next?  Well Chuck, the mother had difficulty getting the daughter to go along. The mother came to work one day and gives my dad a little yellow sticky that said "Here's her email address. She says it's ok."   This was the yellow sticky that I now held in my hand, with my blood pressure reaching record levels. I did not want any part of this. An email address? Dating has "evolved" to this?  I asked daddy-o the obvious question:  P: What does she look like? D: "She's tall".  Sign me up - that's all I needed to know!  D: "She's a nice girl" P: How could you possibly know this? You talked to her for 10 seconds! D: "What do you have to lose? You have no life anyway."  Ahh, now everything is coming into focus. It probably went down like this: "My daughter has no life. What about your son?" "Nope - total loser" "Hey, they should go out!"  It turns out that this woman knows (and therefore, has told her daughter): I work for a large software firm, I have "a lot" of stock options, and I own my own house. In the meantime my dad, aka Inspector Clouseau, has found out the following:  She's tall.  Well, I ain't no sugar daddy. No way in hell am I going to send this girl email. I was hoping that if I could stall until after April 15th - Tax Day - the two matchmakers would go there separate way until next year and I'd be home free.  Problem is, my dad is like a woodpecker. Taptaptap, have you sent her mail yet, taptaptap, when will you, taptaptap, taptaptap...WILL YOU PLEASE SHUT THE HELL UP!  Well, to make a long story short, he got my email address and is going to pass it along to her. Needless to say, I'm irritated.   Now before all of you start with your "What do you have to lose, maybe she's a nice girl" routine, all I can say is you don't know my dad. I don't have a problem with meeting her. Thing is, unless I marry this woman, at some point I will have to justify it to the Parental Superior Court:  "Did you go to lunch?" (taptaptap) "Yup" "And..." (taptaptap) "She's not my type" "Why not? She's a perfectly good girl! What's your problem?" (TAPTAPTAPTAPTAPTAP) argument ensues  I'll probably have to have lunch with her just to shut Woody up temporarily.  All for you married folks, you should go home tonight and say the following to your spouse: "Honey, I love you, I'm really glad that I don't have to worry about dating ever again, and I promise to leave our children alone instead of driving them insane before they turn 30"

        [Fast forward to Dec 1, 1998]   Well, let's move back slightly from the present day, to roughly August/September of this year. I'm out running errands, and I end up near a certain Starbucks where, rumor has it, the Latte Lady is currently pouring. I stop in and sho-nuff, there she is. We talk briefly and she asks if I still have her phone number. I say no, so she runs into the back of the store, comes back and gives me her number, saying "Call me, we'll go out".   Now, this kind of stuff doesn't usually happen to me, and when it does it normally ends with a friend of mine throwing her over his shoulder and carrying her out of my house to fulfill his own fantasies (that really happened btw). At any rate, I decide that there's no way I should pass this up.  We go out for lunch. Have a good time.  Then I kinda get caught up in another Chronicle for a few weeks. At the same time, a mutual friend is consistently trying to set us up, but every time she tries one or the other of us is not available.  Tick, tick, tick, tick.  Alright, back to the present. I've been trying to get a hold of the Beanie Babe for the last coupla weeks, and I've been planning on inviting her to my Christmas party. I also heard through the grapevine that she heard about the blessed event and was somewhat disappointed that she wasn't invited.   I FINALLY get a hold of her last night. She can't make it to the party because she's studying for finals. Hey, she's 26...  At any rate, we talk about going out to lunch again and agree that we'll talk next week after finals are over to decide when and where to go. Not a problem.  Today, I get the following email:  -----Original Message----- Sent:	Tuesday, December 01, 1998 11:16 AM Subject:	Barista - News Flash  Dateline: Saturday, November 28th, 1998  The barista Gets ENGAGED -----Original Message-----  I think the following "Very funny, like I'll be engaged to her next Thankgiving weekholycrapthat'slastSaturday!"  Uhhhh, excuse me?  This takes the cake. I've had a lot of weird things happen, but this wins the award. I don't really know what else to say. At least now you understand why I had to revive the Chronicles for this one last time.   Epilogue  There is one interesting trend in all of this. As far as I can tell, since my last semester of college ten years ago, every woman that I have even remotely pursued has ended up marrying the next person she runs into. I kid you not.   I should start my own business. If you want to marry someone, pay me. I'll take the money and use it to go out with the woman in question. If she doesn't marry you, you get your money back.   And every February I'll throw in a free side of beef.

        [Ed: This is the first in a rebroadcast of The Bachelor Chronicles in a shameless attempt to backfill my blog with interesting posts.   I'm already getting tired of rehashing everything, so I'm going to batch up the last two Java Jive's, add one more event, then close the book on the past. You're welcome.   This one was originally written 5/16/1997]   Well, I've been sending these to the guy I get coffee with in the morning, and he took the Transitive Agent stuff to heart and got a better idea of Ms. WithAPulse's age. I was tired of the whole thing and was planning on (drumroll please....) asking her how old she was, but he found out that she's had the dog since it was a puppy, making her anywhere from 22-24. Close enough.  I've had a little trouble reeling in my Transitive Agent. From now on, let's call him Mr. T, as in Testosterone. He's starting to use Starbucks as his personal brothel, scamming on three different women in the last two months, including actually mashing with one right in front of everyone.  [Ed: He ended up marrying this woman]  I tried to explain this to him, but he didn't understand until I put things into a metaphor.  You see, with women, I'm like Trader Joe's or Larry's Market - very selective, kinda upscale and conservative. He's definitely Costco - volume, volume, volume, move 'em in, move 'em out. After basically begging him to stop making me look bad by association, we've agreed to declare Starbucks a scamming sanctuary until I get closure on the barista.  We're set up to have lunch on Tuesday, so that will be my last update. In Chronicle tradition, everything after First Contact is sacred. Obviously, if you get a new Chronicle it's safe to assume the last one didn't work out.

       Nothing like talking about a lack of readers, then going dark for two weeks, huh? Nothing like that post-vacation workload to keep you from blogging. But here I am, back and not all that rested after returning from the annual Bring Your Liver To The River camping trip, also known as Sausage Fest 2004.  Not much to talk about on the dating front. I went on a couple of dates while I was out, but none that will result in a followup. I think I need to go on a little bit of a hiatus and focus on enjoying the remaining bits of summer here in the northwest.  There is one "open issue" though -  IM Chick  is still alive. Got an email from her that almost reads like she's asking me out even though it includes the f-word. That's "friend" you sickos; if it was what you're thinking I would've acted on it by now!   I'm not sure what she wants. Maybe she's using the f-word as a way to see me again without letting on. Maybe she just wants to be friends. Maybe she's bored. I'm still in a state of shock that's she has continued to try and contact me for the last two months when I haven't lifted a finger for her. I guess it's true what they say: the more you ignore them the more they come back.   I've been going back and forth between telling her I'm not interested and actually going out with her again. I still think the best possible outcome would be a friends with benefits situation, but the only way to know if that's possible is to go out with her I suppose. Plus, at least that way I can get closure.   That's all for now. Just wanted to say I'm back and haven't forgotten about you. I had a lot more to say but I can't remember what it was. Must've been important.
