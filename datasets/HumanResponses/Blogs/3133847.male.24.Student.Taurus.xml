       Hii all, I have now revamped my blog. Have finally been able to enable comments by anonymous people.   I got feedback for this blog by a person who was most probably searching for some other Sanyal and found me instead.. ;)  He has encouraged me to stick it through B school, and I will.  Chalo, I'm hungry, and mess closes soon.  Good night!!

       We have finally received the uniforms, at least the ones used for&nbsp;formal occasions. The ones to be used for gym etc. have yet to be issued. &nbsp; &nbsp;

       This is a post meant for my friends from WIT.  Most of us have now secured jobs at good locations through out the country. Some of them have even started skipping jobs. Some of them havegone in for more education in foreign countries.  Nikhil Patil went to Australia to pursue his MS. Vipin Ajmera is liikong after his family business. Nagu left a plum job at Mahindra to be with his parents and start a business there. Deepesh Jain is in Mumbai, as is Prateek Shah and Vishal Shah.  Ajay Kulkarni is at Caritor, and he plans to write a book about his engineering days. Mahibub is at MobiApps Bangalore. Suyog Upadhaye is at Wipro. Raghu is at MBT. Suyog Kulkarni is at Wipro. Sandeep Patki is switching jobs. Panku is a whiz in microsoft technologies now. Nitin is in a shifting of base, from Mumbai to Pune.  Nivesh is in Bangalore, Mayank is at  Geometrix Noida, Sachin Jain is in Bharti TElecom, Tarun is in his dad's Business.....  Pallavi is in Mumbai, Pradnya is doing a CCNA course, Sapana is trying out for the armed forces. .. The list goes on.  All this makes me think... That in all the hustle bustle of our work and study, I hope we still stay in touch. Because memories of WIT are an integral part of who we are today.  Well, Abhishek Malu is with me here at SIIB.   --  http://adityasanyal.blogspot.com

        Happy Friendship day!!!             Well, the countdown began a couple of hours before the clock stuck 12... And then all hell broke loose. Cheers, good wishes, and basically everyone was in a very good mood, in spite of the continuous rain. The guards came up to see what was the matter.Sunday morning, no one really wants to study but classes go on as usual. We sit through them and raced to the mess where we spend a good hour singing boisterously. Evening, most of us went to the city but it was raining heavily, so not much fun there.  More presentations coming up, and also the exams, so I'm studying a bit now. Suffering from cold, sore throat, cough and fever. Great timing.
