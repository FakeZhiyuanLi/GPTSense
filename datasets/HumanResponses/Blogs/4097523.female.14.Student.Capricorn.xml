       Man, I dont know whats up, but like I just feel like xiet...yday i was sick, and I dunno sometimes I just wish I could be the person, who could just yell and scream about all my problems, but no I just have to sit around, and let people tell me how sucky stuff is or how horrible I am, and why can't I do this or that...WELL you know why, because i dont f-ing want to. Everyone expects me to be just the way they want me to be, and ya know what sometimes I just cant do that and it hurts that some people think they can treat me how ever they want to, and they think they can just walk all over me, well I have feelings too, and I dont like it when you call me names, hmm I wonder why not...well I dont know I just I'm mad at my friends parents right now, cause they are sooo mean to her, and I didnt know what to say to make her feel better, and I still don't know what to say, Sometimes I wish I could protect everybody, and sometimes, I just wish someone would protect me...IDK...*sigh* everything is kinda sucky...band starts tomorrow, which means I have to see my ex for the first time since we broke up, and I dunno, I think it's gonna be wierd, and I do get to see a lot of my friends which I suppose is a good thing, but Idk things are changin so much these days, I dont know if I can deal with it all...So thats why I'm writing all this whiny bs in here, because I don't want other people to feel like they have to listen to me cry and whine and be a little grr...lol I'm not real sure what a little grr is but w/e...I just need to move on and suck it up and do what everyone tells me to, I actually practiced my french horn today, and I sounded okay...I mean I've practiced, but I really don't like how I sound since i got my braces, but I sounded kinda normal...I was supposed to go to the mall today, but Cristo never called me, so I'm sure she was tired from the party last night...but I dunno, I've been thinkin bout old times, all the good times, and the bad times, and I guess the good outweigh the bad, but sometimes I'm not so sure, I didnt get to go to church today, and I really really wanted to, but w/e, And I want to talk to Michael, because he's a dork, lol, and I really wanna talk to this guy because he makes me feel better, but I cant right now..and I dunno, I still kinda hurt from being sick yday, it feels like someone punched me in the side like a million times, I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital yday, but I didnt want to because that would mean that something was really wrong, and I might've had to miss the first few days of band, and that would've sucked, because even though I don't really wanna go, I don't wanna be behind. And then school is gonna start, and I'm scared that I'm gonna get in lots of trouble becaus of my big mouth well I dunno what else to say so I'm gonna jet  For now this be ya girlie Chatty Holla ScReW pEaCe ShOw Me ThE lOvE ~me~
