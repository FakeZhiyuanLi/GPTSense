       Basketball, to me, has always been a life-long love that has taught me many things. Not many people know this, but i practice basketball each day more than I sleep. People think I am crazy for playing so much, and I am crazy;  crazy about the game .I desire to be able to play at the college or maybe even professional level. I will do anything it takes to get there and thats why I believe that I can accomplish these goals. However, everyone I know tells me that I can't and won't ever be able to do this. These attempts to destroy my hopes and dreams only serve as but a sense of motivation inside. In fact I encourage people sometimes to make fun or cast down so that I can have some type of mental motivation. I am a competetor; meaning I don't like to lose. Although I realize that growth can sometimes only occur with defeat. I strive to make my attitude in life a winning one. Whether it be in school, basketball, or just in life overall. I know that in order to be successful in life you must surround yourself with winning attributes  -  ( God,Family,Attitude,Morals,and Friends).

      Hilary, If you get a chance to read this I am probably in Baton Rouge by now. My grandmother is on her death bed and wishes to see my brother and I for a while. I am sorry I am leaving on such short notice but I hope you understand.  We were tallking about you and your career choices earlier. I didn't get a chance to tell you, but God will help you find your way. If you need help look to Him! Just Remember, Always work hard, as if you know someone is out there working twice as hard and as long as you. That's my motivation anyway. But just live by that moral/goal (whatever you want to call it) and everything will be fine. I hope to talk to you and speak with you so. I'll be back Wednesday. So until that time here is a poem I wrote, enjoy it and think of me!(It's kind of sad but it's one of my better ones!)   Today, I told you how I felt, But when you responded, my heart began to melt, For, once again, I was rejected, Just as I expected, I tried so hard and failed, Your hand, a its lonesome, I never held But I always know that I will have you for a friend, And it will be that way to the end, Although, selfishly, I want more, But it feels like my love and care is blown right out the door, I hope one day you will find someone like me, Of course with better looks, and speaks to you ever so softly, I do not know what to do now, When to talk to you or even how, So, Let me thank you for letting me down with much compassion, Although it still feels like my heart has had many lashings, Now I feel better getting this out, So I shall smile again and continue to dance about, Please remember I am always here, Waiting for you in the shadows, hiding everyone of my tears.  Hilary, This is a poem I wrote one day for someone that got rejected. They needed to express themselves and I helped them. If you ever need help b, let me know.  So till we speak again Ms.Gibbs This is for you and only you Love, Andrew
