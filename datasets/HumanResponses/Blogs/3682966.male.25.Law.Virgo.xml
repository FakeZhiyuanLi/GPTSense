      The past week, including today, has just been shit.  Shit, shit, shit.  Let me count the ways....  1) I did not get the job I thought I had.  That's right, after waiting around whilst a certain NJ lawfirm played grab-ass for  five fucking weeks , I finally learned this past Tuesday the truth.   I am not going to be hired on.   Look, I understand that not every resume I send out will be received favorably.  I understand not every prospective employer will hire me.  Honestly,  I get that.   What I don't understand is why would they tell me they (a) have work; (b) need someone to do the work; (c) pay that person handsomely; and (d) inform me that I fit the bill?  Is it malicious?  Is it entertaining?  Do they enjoy causing me to quit my bartending gig in anticipation of actually beginning my chosen career with some sense of panache?    After consulting my handy-dandy Magic 8-Ball (patented), " all answers point to YES ."  So, as the faithful reader now knows, your Saintly friend has no job, and no woman.  (If I had a dog, I'm sure it would've died at some point this week.)  I swear, sometimes I think my life is a Kenny Chesney song...  The intervening days passed, barely.  With no job, and nothing to do, I pretty much sat around the house (where there is STILL no food) and smoked grass to pass the time away.  Not a bad gig, really, but I'd much rather be working than sitting on my ass.    2) Saturday night, I ventured into NYC to see my friend's girlfriend's friend's (say  THAT  three times, fast, motherfucker!) dance troupe perform.    I know precisely jack shit about modern dance.   Ok, ok; I know precisely shit about the dance in general.  Still, the performance was quite good, if a bit...I don't know...angry?  Apparently, our choreographer friend stamps her work with furtive, angry movements.  And sensual ones.  It's hard to tell what sort of emotion she's seeking to illicit.  But the dance was not the problem Saturday night.  Oh no, indeed!  The problem was my friend, let's call him Johnny Two-Shoes.    My friend's girlfriend has another friend, who we'll call Fatima.  (Why Fatima? Because I like the name.)  Fatima is an attorney in NYC, and she's a hottie.  Oh mai oui!  Fatima and I met last August, and I was infatuated; it seemed she enjoyed my company as well.  So there we are, after the performance, enjoying some champagne and conversation (this is Fatima and me, now) and I suggest we go grab some dinner.  It's eleven o'clock on a Saturday night, I'm on Seventh, suggesting a meal to a woman I hardly know.  (I was very proud of me...)  She's cool, so we grab the coterie; my friend, his girlfriend, J. (a cool chica from S. Africa), and Johnny Two-Shoes.   Did I mention Johnny Two-Shoes was recently appointed Cock-Blocker General by the Presidential Go-Home-Alone-You-Miserable-Loser Commission?   The six of us end up on 7th and 22nd, at some Thai place.  I like Thai food; I practically lived on it in college for about a month there...  Johnny Two-Shoes, meanwhile, sits down across from Fatima, who I'm hoping is gonna invite me over for breakfast, and starts acting like a complete ass.  And, of course, he's not content to ruin his own image, oh no; Johnny-Boy wants to take me down with him.  All it took was one sentence:  "Hey, man, you're turning 26 in August, right?"   DUMBASS MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!   See, Fatima's 31, and apparently she thought I was like 28 or 29.  Apparently, she has a problem dating younger men.  And, apparently, this includes inviting them for breakfast just the once, too.  So, no horizontal bunny-hop for your intrepid blogger.  Again.  (I swear, I'm just going to open up a Home for the Chronically Unlayable one of these days.)  3)  Today, which really puts everything else into perspective.  See, there I am, my beautiful Bonneville all packed and ready to drive back to Kentucky.  I get in, start her up, and hit the road.    I made it 20.4 miles.  Apparently, I have a broken water pump, which in turn caused my engine coolant to leak all over the outside of the engine, instead of being fed into it.  (For those of you who know nothing about cars, engines need coolant on the inside.)  This of course, leads to my overheat (at 20.4 miles from home).  How did I learn about this problem, you may ask?  Well, after waiting the obligatory two hours for AAA to arrive, I caught a tow from some guy named Joe.  Joe was a good egg.  Joe was not, however, from AAA; so I gave Joe $109.50 and he dropped me off  six miles away .  Scott, manager/owner of a friendly auto shop, informed me of the above situation, and continued to point out that, not only did I need a new water pump, but I needed a new serpentine belt and a thermostat as well.  All told, I'm paying this guy $522.73.  For those of you playing along at home, driving 20.4 miles today cost me $632.23.  Actually, it's $661.10; I got gas, too.  My car will  hopefully  be ready tomorrow morning at nine.  Then, of course, I gotta figure out a way to get to it, considering it's 30 or so miles away, and I'm back in Mom and Dad's place, sitting on my ass.  Again.  Motherfucker.

      For as long as I can remember, which is to say, since I was about 4 or so, I've always loved to read.  I read voraciously.  I read like a starving man gulps water.  I read with fanaticism in my heart and head.  As a law student, I'm required to read roughly 200 pages of cases and explanatory text each night.  Every night, when I finish reading a funny, if antiquated, opinion by the ultra-hip Judge Learned Hand ( Who names their son "Learned Hand?" ) I'll pick up a book and read until I fall asleep.    And I tell you true, I remember almost everything I read.  I could tell you the plots to any number of  Hardy Boys Mysteries  I read at age nine.  I could chart Verne's  Journey to the Center of the Earth  from memory.  I can tell you exactly what happens in a comic book I read at age thirteen, if only you show me the cover art.  I don't say this to brag; after all, what kind of person boasts about remembering meaningless plot developments?  I merely point out you  REALLY  don't want to play  Trivial Pursuit  with me.    I won't even bring up my encyclopedic knowledge of Classic Rock.  Tagging alongside my appetite for the written word is my equally ever-present need to write.  Scenes, plays, fiction, satire, high fantasy, introductions without material to be introduced, you name it.  Most often, I find myself writing feverishly for about 5 pages, depicting characters I've never thought about beforehand, in situations with no backstory.  I consider these to be "middle" bits, of stories I have not written.    I often wonder if I could take all those little "middle" pieces, put them together, and get an entire book out of them.  If I ever try it, and it works, I have no idea what kind of book it will be.  I find myself thinking along these lines because, I really haven't tried to write  anything  in months.  Then, on a whim, I've begun this little 'blog.  I don't know where I'm going with it yet, or even if I want it to go anywhere at all.  I think I was hoping to be funnier?

      Now, you should know, when I start out with a title like that, you're in for a bumpy ride.  Then again, since I haven't actually put anything down yet, maybe it won't be that bad.  Time, as usual, will tell.  Tonight, I hung out with some of my closest friends; one in particular is the subject of tonight's diatribe.  We'll call her Jenny, just to keep things suitably anonymous.  Perhaps I'll slip up later, but for now, it's Jenny.  Jenny and I have dated several times, beginning when I was sixteen, and most recently ending this past February.  Or maybe January?  I suppose it depends on which one of us you ask...but, for the sake of integrity, posterity, and consistency, we'll just say February, since that's when I found out it was over.    The thing about Jenny is, all these past ten years we've known each other, is that I cannot stay away from her.  Even when I wasn't emotionally attached, something about Jenny always kept me coming back for more.  Maybe it was because she always kept my ego in check.  Maybe it's because she's a hottie.   Maybe it's because she's one of the perhaps 5 people on this planet I can be completely honest in front of.  Maybe it's all of those put together...  Jenny's ruined a lot of things for me, most notably the smell of vanilla.  She's been wearing vanilla oil for as long as I've known her, and I tell you true, I cannot deal with that smell anymore.  Unless it's   her   smell.  Then, it's like being home again after months away.  (An apt analogy, since the majority of our quasi-relationship has occurred whilst I was hundreds of miles away.)  But I'm digressing, aren't I?  Jenny (still not her real name, mind you) loved me for a long time, and most of it, I had no idea.  I never knew if I loved her, which is a strong sign I didn't.  Then, somewhere around New Year's, I realized I DID love her.  And it was everything I remembered, and a whole lot more.  It was the great thing my life has been missing.    Problem was, Jenny wasn't in love with me anymore.  Oh no, she'd given up waiting for me to come around.  Over ten years, bad timing has been our hallmark.  I wouldn't be suprised if the day I realized I loved her was the same day she decided to move on.  If it wasn't so damned ironic, it'd probably be depressing.  Jenny is still one of my closest friends, and I'll admit, I'm having a lot of trouble divorcing my romantic and carnal urges from the platonic ones.  Tonight I had a big problem.  Something about that woman just makes me forget the rules..  It's not like I haven't tried to get her back, because I have.  She wasn't intertested.  And I don't blame her; in fact I understand her feelings as completely as a man can understand a woman's feelings.  That's a big part of the irony.    But tonight, I had to say something, had to try again.  Ultimately, I failed again to get her back.    Sometimes I think this limbo is killing me.  Sometimes I couldn't care less.  Ambivalence in love is no fun, believe me.  I've recently realized there have only been three women I've ever truly cared about in my life.  Jenny, and two others.  The first was another girl in highschool; we lost touch years ago, though occasionally I hear from her.  She never writes back.  The other was about as brief as brief can be.  Only a few days, years ago.  I don't really know if I regret caring for her, despite the pain that came later.  All I can say is that for a short while, I thought I'd found someone special.  She never believed I cared for her, to this day I still don't know what she thinks about those days.  I often wonder, though.  The point of tonight's (or should I say "this morning's"?) diatribe has escaped me.  Of course, eloquence went the way of the dodo a while back, too, so what am I worrying about?  Either way, I'm starving, and there's still no damn food in this house.   Zen Happens

      Today began with a rude awakening.  There I am, blissfully asleep, enjoying some fairly interesting random neuron-firings, when my mother walks in and wakes me up.  Gee,  thanks .    You ever get woken up from a dream?  Of course you have.  This morning, it was right at the point where all the confusing shit in my head was about to be explained to me, courtesy of one of my friendly neighborhood dream-people.  (Sometimes, I call them dreople, but that just confuses the issue...)   I fucking hate it when that happens.   I mean, it really pisses me off when that happens.  Here I am, all set to learn  why  there's a talking monkey wearing a unitard, trying to sell me life insurance, and then POOF!  Welcome back to the waking, daylight, no-fun-at-all world.    Then, it's a quick shower and dress, and I'm off to the "assisted living facility" to pick up Grandma.  Yet another doctor's appointment.  Well, the doc went fine, but he wants me to take her to the Urgent Care Center across the street for tests.   What, really, is the difference between Urgent Care and Emergency Care?  Personally, I'm waiting for a drive-through service.  So, I've been sitting here, with my wireless connection, for the past three hours, whilst Grandma is poked, prodded, sampled, juilliened, and frappeed.  And, of course, this place smells like death and feces.   I often wonder,  do doctors and nurses voluntarily have their olfactory senses cauterized before embarking on their careers?   And now, back to your regularly scheduled day...   Zen Happens

      I'm hungry.  It's two o'clock in the morning, and I am completely famished.  I'm living in my parents house for the past month or so (a visit which is, at turns, enjoyable and interminable), and these people have NO FOOD IN THE DAMN HOUSE.  Allow me to be completely clear on this point:   I am fucking tired of low carbohydrate dieting.   Sue me.  Hate me.  Revile me.  Tar-and-feather me.  But please,  PLEASE  get some fucking bread and pasta here, pronto.  I think I might waste away...  Would it be so fucking hard to have a bag of pretzels?  Or some crackers?  Maybe, and I don't want to start a revolution here, but maybe some cookies?   I am not on this stupid, and ultimately-it's-got-to-be-unhealthy, diet.    Thank you.    You know what my dining choices are around here?  If you said Canadian bacon, steak, and a  whole fucking mountain of salted cashews , you win a prize.     Prizes will be awarded at the sole discretion of the author, who has no prizes to give, nor any conceivable method of actually getting such a prize to the intended recipient.   Now, at two o'clock in the morning, a lot of people are probably thinking, "Fuck it, man, it's late.  Go to bed."  Yeah?  You ever tried falling asleep when you're hungry?  It's easier to pass a fucking kidney stone through that little hole in the end of your prick.  Well, perhaps that's an exaggeration...  You might be wondering why I don't just by some groceries for myself?  I'll tell you; I tried that.  Didn't work.  Neither of these diet-mongers could handle  the Temptation  of food that actually might have carbohydrates in it.  They ate everything.  Let me get this straight: Jesus can walk the desert without food and water for an extended period of time, and then, on his last breath, tell the Devil to take a flying leap instead of accepting some bread and water from him?  And my parents can't handle a bag of Rolled Gold?  Thank the old G-D we're Jewish.   Zen Happens

      I first got involved with online dating about 2 years ago, on the recommendation of my cousin, who met his wife through such a service.  I figured, if J can meet his wife, surely I can find someone to take out once or twice.  Right?     WRONG   Contestant #1 was L.  L was a good match, realistically.  We were into similar things, held similar views on the world and politics.  She loved the Yankees.  We went on two dates, and then things went to shit.  Apparently, L had a problem with blowing people off.  Ok, ok,  I  had a problem with L blowing  me  off.  We'd make plans, and she'd just no-show.  Or, she'd never return phone calls.  Or she'd just leave me hanging.  When pressed, L was indignant, "We're not serious, you know."    Yeah, I know, sweet, but come on!  All I'm asking for is a little courtesy.  Is that too much to ask?  Plans change?  Just call me and let me know!  I'm secure enough in myself and with myself to take a rain check, fer chrissake!  And then we have Contestant #4, A.    (Contestants #2 & #3 were just bad ideas....)  A contacted me because (a) she thought I was cute, and (b) because we're both living in Louisville, but originally from NJ.  We got to talking, first via e-mail, and then on the phone.  She seemed really cool.  She seemed really nice.   She said she looked like  Taylor Dayne .     For those of you out there unfamiliar, Taylor Dayne looks  good.   So, A and I decided to meet up at a local watering hole for drinks and pool.  Another bonus point, since I love to shoot pool, and I don't mind drinking while I do it.  I walk in, and there's this woman staring at me.  She did  not  look like Taylor Dayne.  She looked like she  ate  Taylor Dayne, and then stretched her face over her own like some  Silence of the Lambs  reject.  But, I was already there, and let's face it, there was nothing preventing me from having some beers, shooting some pool, and bowing out gracefully at the end of the night.  You know, be a nice guy, try not to hurt her feelings?  Good plan, but as we all know, execution is critical for the success of any plan.  Well, I didn't execute.  No sir.  I did not execute at all.  Instead of following my hastily laid plan, which would have been the intelligent maneuver, I proceeded to drink about 6 beers in the space of two hours.  I was  buzzed .  Then, she asked me if I'd like to go get high.     It was, I believe, at this point that my brain took a vacation, leaving the controls in the less-than-capable hands of my cerebellum.  Yep, the "lizard brain."  My brain and I are still having problems as a result of this error in judgment.   So, we go back to her place, and smoke a bowl or two.  Then, she's kissing me.  Impromptu of nothing, she's kissing me.  (Well, that's not fair, we  were  on a date.)  The next thing I know, and I mean  literally 45 seconds later , my pants are off, and she's singing karaoke on my personal microphone.   At this point, I'm completely flummoxed.  Not that the experience was new to me, but the sheer rapidity with which I found myself in a denuded state was rather shocking.  Still, I was not yet at the point of problems.   Perhaps 5-10 minutes later, she's asking me if I would like to watch some porn.   WHAT!?   You're telling me I can sit here, do NOTHING, recieve some fairly decent stimuli, and not even pay attention to you?  Are you kidding?  Are you serious?  Did I win Powerball?  So, being the slightly drunk and certainly stoned chap I was, I said, "Sure.  Whatever you want."   Looking back, this was definitely where my brain should have kicked in and pointed out a few things.  Like the fact that this woman was 6 years my senior.  Like the fact that she was treating my like her own personal salt lick within moments of getting me into her apartment.  Like the fact that she owned a library of erotic books.  Like the fact that she was, perhaps, large enough to sustain her own moon.  But no, my brain was not there; I got a postcard from him though.  My brain was in Amsterdam at a sex show.  That asshole's always getting me into trouble...   So, she flips on the TV, presses PLAY on the VCR, and I am immediately treated to a back-door entry sequence.  My first reaction was something along the lines of, "Ok, so she likes it like  that .  Then, to my horror, the camera zoomed out, and the woman had a pair of testicles.  A LARGE pair of testicles.  Now, I'm thinking, "Why does this chick have balls?"  In retrospect, I was fooling myself.    Then, the angle changed.  As did the positions.  Sure enough, I'm watching two men treating each other to a flesh enema.    You know, I have nothing against homosexuality.  I believe that in this world it is hard enough to find someone who makes you feel complete.  If that person ends up being the same sex?  Fine.  Have fun.  Just don't ask me to watch, please.  I like the ladies, some guys like guys.  I've had plenty of friends in my life who were homosexual, or bi-sexual, or what-have-you.  I think love and lust are wonderful things, and whatever gets the motor running is cool with me.  Well, necrophilia and pedophilia are out of bounds, and I've never really gotten my head around the whole "shit on my chest, baby," thing, but I'm digressing.  Point is, I'd heard about two men in coitus.  I've had some fairly graphic discussions with some of my friends about it.  I'd even created a mental picture.  But man!  I ain't never seen it before then.  To tell the truth, I'd prefer to never see that again.  It looked really painful, and hairy, and...um...yeah.  So, of course, I turned the movie off.  A's all in a tizzy.  "Why'd you do that?  I thought you said you wanted to watch a porno."  "You didn't tell me it was a gay porn."  "Oh, but if it was two girls, that'd be fine?"  "YES!"  "Well, that's gay porn."  "NO!  That's PORN!"   I'd love to be able to say that the evening ended there. I'd love to be able to say that I gathered my scattered clothing and left.  Really, that's a great way to end this story.  But, then, I'd be lying if I said that.  No, I spent the night with this woman.    Like I said, my brain was in Amsterdam at a sex show.  What was I supposed to do?   And that, dear friends, is the last online love connection I'm planning on making.  This shit's just too damn weird for me.

      No doubt about it, everyone remembers where they were, and what they were doing on 9/11.  Hell, I don't even need to mention the year anymore, do I?  Nope, that day has become my generations "Where were YOU when Kennedy was assasinated?"  I sometimes wonder if comments like that last bit trivialize the impact of 9/11 on America, and Americans.    Then I remember how 9/11 REALLY was, at least in Bloomington, Indiana.    Let's just get this right out: that day was so shocking it shut my brain down for about 3 days.  It took me that long to get in touch with my friends and family in NYC and NJ, and until I knew everyone was OK (well, not everyone...), I couldn't even come to grips with the tragedy.  I still can't look at pictures of the Towers.  I just can't.  I guess there are a lot of people like me, in that respect.  But I'm not here to write about 9/11, or the Towers, or the $2.99 Wal-Mart patriots out there with the plastic flags hanging off the windows of their cars, "United We Stand" bumper stickers festooning their vehicles.  No, I'm not going to go into that rant; I've done it before, and I'm tired of that particular level of bullshit.  Thing is, around 2:00 on 9/11, sitting with some friends and trying to get a grip on myself, I remember the conversation we had while watching CNN.  D remarked how this didn't sound like the act of a bunch of cowards (which many of us agreed with, and Bill Maher echoed hours later.)  Then, I remember thinking, and saying, how 9/11 was going to be the best thing that ever happened to George W. Bush's Presidency.  I remember telling my friends that when Bush came up for re-election, I wouldn't be surprised if someone got on TV and suspended elections, for the sake of National Security.  "My fellow Americans," it would begin, "due to the Justice Department's sure knowledge that terrorists plan to disrupt voting in the coming Presidential Election, we are hereby suspending national elections for the duration of the crisis."  Sure, you're thinking I'm a conspiracy nut, right?  Well, I wasn't entirely serious when I put the idea out there, nearly 3 years ago, but since then, I've been taking a real close look at what our government's been up to.  Especially recently.   DISCLAIMER:  The following is going to look like a conspiracy theory.  That's because it IS a conspiracy theory.  However, I am not a left-wing loony-toon, neither am I currently under psychiatric evaluation.  Nor am I insane or a paranoid.  I simply see things, hear things, and have put them together in this manner.   Here's the thing:   Tom Ridge announced recently that Al Qaeda is supposedly planning to "disrupt" elections in November.    HOW?  WHY?  And what, pray tell, could ANY terrorist really do to disrupt elections on the national level?  Blow up EVERY polling site?  How about half of them?    Realistically, absent such mammoth undertakings, the polls are as safe as they've been since we stopped allowing partisans in the building years ago.  It sounds to me like Phase 1 of "Operation: Scare the Voters."  What are we supposed to think?  Sure looks like we're supposed to be SO SCARED of VOTING this Fall that enough people won't show up to vote, which would then pretty much hand Bush II the election.   Hey, if there really is a clear and immanent danger,  why not just make everyone vote via ABSENTEE BALLOTS ?   Then, the other day, our friendly CIA chief decides to step down, pre-empting his termination over the intelligence failures which "allowed" 9/11.  Of course, the Bush Administration has been fingering the CIA for 2 years now on this, and refuses to accept any culpability for the attacks.  The CIA is also apparently at fault for telling the White House Iraq had WMD, when it didn't.    So, with the elections "in jeopardy" we have lost the top spy in the country, and there doesn't seem to be too big a rush to replace him.  Does there?  Thing is, George T. was a good man, a  Clinton  man.  Me?  I think he saw the way the wind was blowing, saw where this Administration is going, and opted out.  If he'd wanted to tag along with Bush and Cheney, they would've spun this differently, mark my words.   So now, we've got election worries, and no head of the CIA.  Plus, we already know that everyone in Bush's administration with the  slightest  bit of integrity won't be back.  (Poor Colin Powell...)  Bush and Cheney (or should I say Cheney?) are lining things up right now, and I worry about where this is going.  I worry that Tom Ridge will keep popping up on TV, telling us about how the Department of Homeland Security has learned Al Qaeda plans to bomb polls in fifteen states, but they don't know which polls, specificially.  I worry that a National State of Emergency will be declared in October, just in time for the World Series.  I worry that Bush will be President again, until he just decides to take over.    Look at the Federal judges he's installed. Congress is certainly backing him up with WHATEVER he wants to do.  By next year, we'll be installing AT LEAST 2 new Supreme Court Justices (if Bush wins, how "conservative" will these people be?)  To me, it sounds like the United States is headed for some serious trouble.  Things keep on like this, and I might consider Canada.   This rant was brought to you by the number 69, and the letters, L, S, and D.

      Okay, this is actually not the current week, but a gripe from a few weeks ago, into last week.  Really, the problem is my car.  My formerly beautiful 1995 Pontiac Bonneville.  Bathsheba, the vehicle in question (so named because   once   she was beautiful and black), has been giving me such problems, I don't know how I manage to keep her running.  Okay, from a previous post, we know I had to get Sheba fixed in late June.  Right, well I drove her to Louisville, and about a week after my LAST post, she over-heated.  Again.  So, I took her in and found out that the previous repair was incomplete, and possibly the guy engaged in fraud.  (The investigation is pending, so I cannot speak more of that matter at this time.)  So, the good folks at the Pontiac dealership took Sheba, fixed her, and charged me $1,181.73.  Plus nearly $350.00 for the rental car.    Current car repair tally: $2,215.29  (or thereabouts)   Then, THREE DAYS after getting the car back, the "tension rod," which holds the serpentine belt in place, snapped on I-264 during rush hour.  Wheee.  Cost of repair?    $411.85   Then there's the rental car, which was another $89.99   Current car repair tally: $2717.13 (or thereabouts)   THEN, my battery died  the day I got it back from Pontiac-people.   Not only died my battery die, but when I tried to jump-start it, my cables got fried, and a burned the ever-loving shit out of my hand.  Yeah, BIG happy-hat people.  Big.  That particular repair (just three days after the previous problem, and the evening I got my car back, cost me $90.    Total Cost of Car Repair, July/August 2004:    $2807.13    (or thereabouts)   My car's blue-book value is somewhere around $3,500.  Did I mention I have no money?  But, now Sheba's running perky, which is good.  Especially since any plans I  might  have had concerning replacing her are totally and completely out the window.   And I still have no job.  But there IS good news:   I finally have food in the house I can eat.
