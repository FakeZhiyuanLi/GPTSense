      Post anything that you want. Anything at all. A story, a memory, a thought, a secret, a confession, a fear, a love, a song, a question you want me to answer, you can tell me what you think of me, or something random on your mind - anything.  Be sure to post anonymously and honestly. Post twice, or as many times that you'd like, and then cut & paste this into your LJ to see what your friends have to say.

      ok, so in my last post I asked abot the alphabets binary numbering used in keyboards, I'm not greatly disappointed in this but the folloing I learned, "each 26 letters (capitalized mind you) is given a decimal number, ok , now here's the simplicity that kills us all, it's A is 1 Z would be 26, so A= 00001, Z=the computer reads=11010, blah frustrating to me, figure it out yourselfs, MY FRUSTRATION AT SIMPLICITY!

      I really like Lauren and Holly, but why must they drink dr. pepper?  DR PEPPER FOR GOD'S SAKE!!. Oh well, yeah, I still like them and they're cool, I'm ann odd little person, I have no reason for being on the computer, I mean I reveiwed binary today, so now I'm going to be like I am 010000[oh, one, oh, oh, oh, oh ] years old, only putting that oh in phront so that people will realize it's in binary. My next step is to learn what a computer reads when you push each key,..anybody happen to have alist of that just lying around? HAHAHA, wow, victoria just IMed me, maybe she's only partway mad at me now...okie well off to go look up what B equals in binary HAHAHA later
