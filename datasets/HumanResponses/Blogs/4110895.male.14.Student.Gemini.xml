       yes, nay got a puppy.    let me clarify, ur.. cleaner's dog had puppies and one of them really liked it @ ur place so decided to stay there? *looks hopeful*       with the whole "year 10s moving up", i agree with mark [for once] and i think u guys should move up cos of all of the above points. "what she said" [the 'she' refers 2 our lil dorkus here]      umm.. and yeh, i don't think i'm going to the prayer rally either..      i think that's it. so.. yep, u guys have fun @ the prayer rally      cyas, dot ^_^      p.s. danie still owes me a shiny yellow star from the first sleepova :D

      SLEEP is good for you. you should SLEEP more. i'm SLEEPy just talking about SLEEP *yawns and nods dreamily*  sorry guys, i won't be at the prayer thing tomorrow night - von and dot, you'll probably have to organise your own transport there, since i dont think my sis is coming either.  mark, Parkes is in the middle of a sheep pen, and i had the pleasure of going there. haven't u seen The Dish before?! [well, actually, i havent either, but ssshhh]  puppy, nay?

       honestly, guys, i go to the middle of a sheep pen for  TWO DAYS  and you guys have already written heaps [not counting the messages that were posted twice]. OK, i'm gonna try and get through this  one  by  one ...      ~ Markyfish is a   neeeerrrrrrrddddddddddddd     ~ I'm generally not too fussed about bible study groups, and I can see what point everyone's making. I really would miss u guys if i went to the college group, but since the yr12's are gonna be "university" ppl, that group WOULD be really small. Anywayz, it would be like old times in Sunday School :D *pictures James shouting at all of us telling us that we're wrong, and shudders* :S   ~ I was only half-serious about the last thing I said   ~ With Marky's #1, I didn't get it either, Von, ur not the only one. I think he's just trying to be a    neeeerrrrrrddddddddd   so just leave him alone      just a very old note, i think i AM going to the anniversary lunch this sunday      Who's the new Alex? Hmm... maybe I really   DO   have to start stretching the borders       ~ Lynn ^-^          pink !!

      meehee.... i posted it twice... that's the stoopid computer/internet's fault. u guys will just have to put up with it. :P  was it just me or was mark being xtra nerdy today? and i didn't get his #1... maybe it has to do with dot hitting me over the head... i know what u feel like now, nate...  ok...   with the best of both worlds thing... u KNOW we're gonna drift apart... we won't get the jokes and u guys will become closer to the rest of the hs group... i dunno maybe it's just my paranoia but...   yeah i agree with mark.. maybe we SHOULD talk to other ppl... i don't feel comfortable around new ppl, but it's time to stretch those comfort zones!   with the whole angelic lil angels thing? i'm not expecting us to be angels.. that'd be too hard... we can joke, all i'm asking is for us to shut up when ppl are talking.. cos sitting on the other end of the table, it's kinda hard to hear when someone sitting closer to u is talking... about irrevelant stuff...   keep talking guys, it'd be cool to hear ALL of ur views...  h&k&amp;atms,  von

      Ooh a few more pointers to add..  1) Although there are people joining there wouldn't be a suffice amount of people who would start at the start of the yr...there may be people who join mid-way thrgouh but we don't kno that. Last yr, when they formed the new HS group i dunno if im right here..but didn't all of us (well excluding me i joined mid-yr)  join right at the start of the yr? They had a decent number of "freshmans" coming into yf so they could put another group together...hehe freshmans can't wait for uni.  2) I don't think it is a good idea for the yr10 ppl to stay with the Hs group and i do have a good reason for this. One of the reasons why we go to tehillah is to have fellowship and trying to put this in a non-harsh way..but i think that people in Y/f should learn to be more open to people. We have to stretch our borders of friendship in a way..we have to welcom the new people... I kno for one that hardly any of us have spoken to Tom or Alex  (yes the new alex..i kno who im talking about) so yup.  That way if the yr10's join the college group it would expand ur friendship boundaries. U get the best of both worlds ain't that great?:D Plus the college group is small enough it needs some people to bolster the group otherwise it'll probably end up folding...  3) Yes we all shuold concentrate but the thing is when ur in such a large group that makes it hard..the reason y sometimes we just start taling is coz the answer is at the other end of the table and we can't hear it..don't get me wrong it would be lovely for all of us to be lil' angelic angels but i for one wouldn't be able to do that for a whole bs session...dunno 'bout u guys though except for nate:P  That is it i beleive..hmm..yes..i dropped my monickle will be back..tarry on  Marky<>

      gahh!! the blogspot thing is dodgy!! it deleted my post!  whoa... we've got like 56 posts on this thing.. that's what the counting thingo said neways  dotpoints cos they're fun... :P   lynn and i haven't quite decided what we're going to do about the college group thing.. and i'm not sure about sherman and george... if we have to, then i guess we have no choice.. but i think we're more comfortable with u guys... i know that we'll be making "new friends" but seriously... i really don't wanna change groups now. also do u think it's possible if the new ppl next yr just made a bs group by themselves, that is if there are more ppl than tim and moses.. cos that's what our sunday school group did when we joined yf.   by "our group is getting a bit too big" i didn't mean split up!! we won't be us if we're in two or more groups and we wouldn't get as many ppl's opinions and stuff.. we wouldn't get as much out of it... i've got lotsa pros and cons for the splitting up bit... i dunno how to say this nicely but maybe we could get the ppl who talk a lot to split up into two different groups or next yr if there's gonna be another hs group other than us, they could move to that one...   that uncontrollable thing? it's true, we're controllable.. if we could get EVERYONE to shut up and concentrate.. but that's a bit hard with such a big group/ some ppl ... we've changed a lot since last yr and our bible studies are gettin more discussion-y... that's gd... but we need evry1 to try and concentrate so that they can get the most out of it and so that they learn more about God, which should be their purpose for coming to yf... not just to socialise.. cos they can do that after church and stuff....   by splitting up, we wouldn't be doing that to escape ppl but to give ppl the opportunity to talk... like putting half of the ppl who talk and half of the ppl who don't talk in one group and the other halves in the other group.... but nay's right... the "quiet" ppl might get more intimidated... i was like that last yr and the yr b4... and we had fairly small groups then... but u guys  know  that u can speak up anytime u want to.. just raise ur hand and wave it around a bit...   another thing... when ppl say things that we don't agree with, maybe it's completely off, but don't all start yelling at them... it's bad enough knowing that ur answer is wrong, u don't need the whole group yelling @ u... it's intimidating and it's enough to make someone not contribute to the discussion for some time... the one person speaking at a time thing....   thanx guys...  h&k&amp;atms,  von

      ok.... looks like i started a whole heap of spam... aren't we glad it's not thru email? it'd be like wk 2 again... scary stuff that...  ok... dot points cos they're fun!   lynn and i haven't yet decided what we wanna do about the whole college group thingo... not sure about sherman and george. we aren't too keen on leaving u guys... don't u feel luved! :P and there was another thing which i've forgotten.. do u think that's it's a possibility that the new ppl next yr form a group of their own if there are more ppl than just tim and moses? cos that's what our sunday school class did when we joined yf...   by too big a group i wasn't suggesting that we split cos i agree that it wouldn't be as fun and as educational.. if that's the proper word to use... we wouldn't get as much out of it... but if u guys wanna say something just stick ur hand up and wave it around... we'll notice u... but mainly the ppl that i'm talking to aren't members of this blog.... that's kinda weird...   also i've found out that the area of the table where the stooges/nay/lynn/dot/tara/me are, mainly the ppl who contribute  the most  to the discussion (and i'm not saying that the others don't), is always the easiest to concentrate in... on sat i found that i really had to strain to listen and i was getting distracted a lot...   also guys, maybe we should be more accepting... if someone says something that we don't agree with, don't all start yelling @ them or arguing against them... it can be kinda intimidating especially knowing that ur answer is wrong, u don't need the whole group trying to disprove ur answer... one person @ a time thing...    :D thanks guys for responding so fast...   and after we're done doing this we could think about bible study books that we wanna do... the life together series (i think that's what they're called) sound pretty gd... kinda expensive though...  h&k&amp;atms,  von

                       okay, accidentally posted this to the wrong  blog..*blushes* sorry..      &nbsp;    1. There's at least 5 people leaving our group and  moving up to the college group next year. Lynn, Von, Sherman, George, and I  think Aimee?      &nbsp;    2. Let me clarify something - I don't mean that  everyone MUST always have something to say, I don't mean that you should say  something if you really don't feel comfortable with it. But we all need to  realise that that's what Bible study is about: studying the Bible together,  discussing the text! Why else would we have a Bible study GROUP if it was for  one person to talk and talk and everyone else to listen? There are times to  listen, times to talk, and we kind of have to do both, peoples : )&nbsp; Plus, I  assure you, it's much easier to talk out of your own choice rather than the  leader pick on you...      &nbsp;

      Heelo all...aah this is an interesting subject to talk about ain't it..its been on my mind for a very long time and time and time time time...  1. I think i was talking to nick and yeah he said no leader to lead us so it'll be leaderless...  2. I like the #2..it sounds kool but um there are alot of pros for being in smaller groups sometimes...Stronger freindship bonds are formed when in closer proximity of people...hehe proximity...nggaahhh neerrrrd!!  3. People may sometimes open up in smaller groups as there are not as many ppl there...i dunno...  Meh i don't mind whether we stick together or not for the time being except..it is gonna get bigger next yr.  Although 2 memebers are leaving moses, andrew, tim are joining.  I kno moses and tim are definites and there are probably more people coming so just bear all of this in mind people.  P.S Haha Chueck went to Yohan's birthday party...Did u go just for the food or did u go as a good friend?:P Haha one up on chueck.  Marky<>

      a lot of people think our group is getting too big..  i think it is a bit too big, and i know some of you want to split off into groups. but there are some things we need to consider:  1. there's less to learn - you have to admit that we have some pretty interesting discussions, that's one of the pros of having a large group - there are more opinions to share.  2. if we have smaller groups, yes, the "quiet people" might speak up. or they might get even more freaked out, and like, two people are always talking, and those two people end up getting nothing out of our Bible studies..  3. think about what it's going to be like when it's you and someone you really don't like stuck in the same group. i know i shouldn't say that, but you know i have a point - i seriously do not mind being in the same group as any of the people in the group already, but just a point to consider, in the hope of "escaping" from these people, you might actually end up having to deal with them more..SO not a valid point for separating into two groups.  4. we don't have the leaders.  5. even if we did have another leader, everybody likes having evan as a leader.    I agree that the group is getting a bit too big, but i think for now we should stay as one big group. i'm not going to mention any names up here. but seriously, some of you hardly ever say anything at Bible study - you're really going to get more out of it if you do ask questions, and you do share. You should know who you are.. I think our group has some issues to deal with before we split up into another group, and the only reason I can think of that's a good enough point to split the group up is that we're "uncontrollable" - which last saturday night disproved..we CAN focus, we just have to try. So try.

      yip... youth sunday was  fantastisch!!    good work guys!! :D  i might be coming to the prayer rally on sat... depends on whether my family decides we're going to sydney or not... hmm... it's most likely a no to the sydney thing cos of transport and accomodation and stoof like that  guys? about our bs group, i think we're getting a bit big... i notice that there are ppl who say a lot and have lots to contribute to the discussion and also ppl who don't say much... i dunno whether this is cos they don't have anything to say/ don't know what to say or because they're overwhelmed... anyone got any suggestions?  tararaboomdeeay is a barney song... did u know that? gave me kinda a shock when i first heard it... and it's tararabooMdeeay or rather ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay... but i still reckon tararaboompdeaay sounds better.. so tara can be the one with the P and the song can be the one without the p...  lynn... i'm always posting @ school because.. i have nothing to do/am slacking off and cos i don't get much time to post @ home... because of SOME ppl.... :P nah.. it's cos i always go on late neways and also it takes up a lot of our downloading megabyte-y thingos...  yeah... this is getting kinda long so i'm going now... u guys have a gr8 wk and wknd if i don't see u and remember to prepare for bs!! :P it's time and gifts.. should be interesting... specially Q1...  h&k&amp;atms,  von

        *hums quietly to herself and pretends to understand all this piano talk*       nate...   NOBODY CARES   btw, mark, 'hc' means 'highly competent' and considering there are only two other levels, hc isnt that great [at least there were only three when i did it last year]      yf tonite... and im really nervous about youth sunday tomorrow and   nay  , how can u lose ur voice  now ?! oh yeah, im not sure if ne of my friends from skool r coming tomorrow, but in case they do,   pls   dont scare them       and how come von's always posting from skool? von,   brisbane is  AFTER  the uk; sometime in october i think...       one last thing - for all the muso ppl reading this, are any of u going in   battle of the bands  ? coz i think its being held at my skool and if it is  dont laugh at me and my friends . yep, i think thats about it      ~ lynn ^-^

That just means we have a new resdent nerd...Nggaahhhh nerd..*sigh* i guess im just trying to throw off the reputation of being a nerd which im not!!:P hehe...aah..where did my pencil go?..i swear i saw it a minute ago..better go look for it now.

      1. yeah, i've told those jokes a million times. though i couldn't help it, it's all nate's fault.  2. i reckon luke allerton's gonna win. but that's depending on what the set piece is...cheuky you better get it memorised...  3. shut up nate, you show-off. and slacker. *rolls eyes* the rest of us did good too, you don't hear us bragging about our results.  4. don't worry cheuk. don't stress out about science and stuff. you got 101 or 104 or something on your science test.

      couple of things:  - the posts should be appearing in chronological order now, it's just that before the time zone for the spam blog was if we were in LA.  - we shouldn't need to worry too much about the colours, cos I'm not going to bother...something's wrong with my comp. But considering I'm using my rgwcb account, it should read "nay" in my signature. Nate's is "nay", mark's is "stooge 2", dan's is "the FLY", von's is "viciousdurian" ...we should be right.  - how is it possible that this whole blogging thing started like, 2 days ago.
