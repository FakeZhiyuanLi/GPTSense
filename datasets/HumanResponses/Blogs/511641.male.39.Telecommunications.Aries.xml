       urlLink Human Body Version 2.0   In the coming decades, a radical upgrading of our body's physical and mental systems, already underway, will use nanobots to augment and ultimately replace our organs. We already know how to prevent most degenerative disease through nutrition and supplementation; this will be a bridge to the emerging biotechnology revolution, which in turn will be a bridge to the nanotechnology revolution. By 2030, reverse-engineering of the human brain will have been completed and nonbiological intelligence will merge with our biological brains.

In this paper, I offer some possibilities for navigating change more effectively.  In this paper, Dale H. Emery present a model of change, which describes the stages we go through as we respond to change. Next he look at why each stage happens, why we respond the way we do, and how we move from one stage to the next. Then he offer some ideas about how to respond more effectively in each stage.

       urlLink The Rational Edge -- September 2003 -- Agile RUP for non-object-oriented projects   The Unified Modeling Language (UML) and IBM Rational Unified Process,® or RUP,® are standard fixtures on most object-oriented projects today. UML is a notation for visually expressing object-oriented concepts; RUP is a process framework that uses the UML to express the content of its artifacts and tasks. But what do RUP and the UML offer that portion of our software community doing non-object oriented development? This article is my answer to that question. As we shall see, RUP and UML can be used quite effectively on software projects in COBOL, C, or even (the dreaded) assembler language.

       urlLink Free Range Learning Support   When you were three or four years old, you asked a lot of questions about the world you experienced.  Why is the sky blue?  Do fish drink?  Why does the moon follow us?  Given your developing command of language and curiosity, it was an easy and rewarding way to augment your experience of the world. By the time you reached six or seven years old, you probably stopped asking so many questions about the things around you. Perhaps you realized that the endless stream of questions began to annoy more than charm your parents. Perhaps you learned how to find the answers yourself. Perhaps, as many learning theorists suggest, your schooling had acclimated you to posing "appropriate" questions and giving "correct" answers.  In my master’s project thesis, I hope to reawaken and re-enable this spirit of inquiry and engagement in the world for adult learners, through the development of an interconnected set of services I call free range learning support.

Some of the uses are infringing on the domain of Human Resources. It is easy for a boss to do a background check on a potential new employee. With Google, the potential new hire can turn the tables, and do a pretty decent background check on the new boss!   Google’s greatest application as an ‘HR tool’ is not in the corporation – it is out among the free agents, consultants and entrepreneurs who live and work by reputation and experience. It is here where ‘Google numbers’ become very important.   Mine Is Bigger Than Yours

      Knowledge Communities in Japan  Like Fred, I also found Hideo Yamazaki’s paper, "Knowledge Communities  in Japan A Case Study," to be quite interesting.  However, I’m not real  sure if I agree that such online or IT based knowledge communities are  real “knowledge” networks that allow for knowledge building, or rather  if they are actually more to the tune of “information” centers.  Velocity - the speed with which knowledge moves through an organization  (1)  Viscosity - the richness or thickness of the knowledge transferred (1)  Mobil Oil's engineers developed some sophisticated ways of determining  how much steam is required to drill under certain conditions.  When  they applied their techniques, they found they could reduce the amount  of steam they generated themselves and bought from outside sources.   Since they knew the precise amount needed, the potential savings were  huge.  So they embedded the technique in an intelligent system, with  the main focus being the knowledge's velocity in order to quickly get  the information out to the field.  This was done by sending a memo to  all the drilling operations detailing the calculations and benefits.   They assumed other sites would quickly adapt the innovation.  Nothing  happened.  The effective viscosity level was zero.  Simply improving a process will not be enough to win over everyone.  So  Mobil came up with some other techniques for transferring the  knowledge, such as videos and case studies and soon raised the adoption  rate to 30%.  It now looks as if it will grow to 50%.  Will it ever  reach 100%?  Who knows?  The resistance to abandoning processes that  have been successful for years is a universal phenomenon and is not  just limited to Mobil.  Velocity strips knowledge and information down to its bare essentials  by removing portions of its context and richness.  And this stripping  effect often takes the message down to the next level for its intended  receivers-- from knowledge to information or from information to data.   Thus the intended knowledge exchange fails.  Now look at how 3M does it -- they have regular meetings and fairs for  exchanging knowledge.  One of their most famous products, scotch tape,  was invented by Dick Drew...a sandpaper salesman.  In almost any other  company his idea would have been tossed out as tape and research were  not his specialty, yet the culture of 3M allows for the "viscosity" of  information to be spread.  And the way they ensure it spreads is  through meetings and knowledge fairs -- it is not left for a chance  happening on their intranet.  In the article, Professor Yamazaki writes, “High-context based  communities in many Japanese companies have been gradually crumbling.”   Perhaps this might be part of Japan's problems -- the replacement of  communities where knowledge exchanges can likely occur with online  communities that often work better as information exchanges.  No don't  get me wrong, both knowledge and information exchanges can occur in  either type of community, however, it is easier to exchange knowledge  in certain types of environments.  Being online allows one to gather a lot of information, yet the vary  nature of it – speed, works against it as being a knowledge-enabler.   Knowledge requires rich sources and context.  For example, one of the  best knowledge-enablers for a beginning learner is apprenticeship as it  allows a rich exchange of concepts and ideas between the learner and  teacher.  As one starts to slowly move away from this form of learning,  the knowledge exchange slowly starts to decrease, while the rate of  information flow increases.  That is, in a class, the information is  going out to a number of learners at once, hence the speed of  information exchange increases; however, the flip-side is that  one-on-one interactions decrease, thus the rate of knowledge transfer  decreases.  This is the first dimension of the  data/information/knowledge continuum – Viscosity/Velocity.  The second dimension of the data/information/knowledge continuum is the  number of paths or streams of information flow.  A single email  (monophonic) sent to a direct report is one stream, where as this list  normally has multiple posts (context) to each thread.  The more posts,  then the more viewpoints one can gather or harvest.  Once a learner  moves past the beginner stage, then these multiple viewpoints start to  become invaluable as they add context to the knowledge base that one  has gained.  For example, A PhD student studies one small section of  his or her field, but does so from multiple contexts.  There is a diagram showing these various relations at: http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/km/knowledge2.jpg  Throughout the various Knowledge Communities and Communities of  Practice, there are different levels of information and knowledge  exchanges.  So how does one determine if the community is mainly an  information exchange or a knowledge creator or builder?  What practices  have to be put in place to raise a information exchange to a knowledge  exchange?  For example, in Professor Yamazaki's PowerPoint slide, there  is a facilitator for helping with the "stroking" of the members.  Is  this enough to ensure the exchange of knowledge?  Another example is  this list -- when does it help to build or exchange knowledge rather  that just exchange information?  Must there be participation or can one  just read the postings and become knowledgeable?  Or are they simply  becoming "informed'?  NOTES 1. Thomas H. Davenport and Laurence Prusak (2000).

It aims to achieve the " Holy Grail " of data portablity as elegantly described by John G. Faughnan.   The major components of the OIO system are the web-accessible OIO Server and OIO Library. OIO Server is a highly flexible web-based data management system that manages users, patients, and information about patients. (Of course, the same system can just as easily manage information about customers, invoices, shipments, and accounts.)   OIO Library is a metadata repository that facilitates the sharing of metadata (e.g. plug-and-play web-forms, project descriptions) between users and between OIO Servers. The OIO Library also hosts a public/open content database of open source medical software projects and related documents.

       urlLink Minimalist Queue Services (MQS)   MQS  (Minimalist Queue Services)  is a  minimalist queueing  system in Free Software. The  main purpose is to provide a  set of basic methods in order to offer asynchronous messaging for program/application.   Applications  can use  this type  of services  in order  to  store and retrieve  message to  dedicated  queue in  the  queue services.   This permits to avoid direct connection between applications and provides a simple asynchronous communication system.   The MQS  Daemon provides a simple  set of XML-RPC  methods for pushing and getting  messages in a specific  queue (so you can  use the system with any application that can  talk XML-RPC). The storing of the queue is in a database (e.g. Mysql, Postgresql...) or in dedicated file(s).

Software professionals need a sizing measure that is understood and accepted by software developers, users and executive management.  Client/server and web applications, in particular, demand better measurement tools to cope with the increasing complexity of the technology.  A practical, flexible, sizing measure is needed not only to develop more reliable estimates, but also to better communicate with technical and non-technical management on issues of scope, change and complexity.    The concept of testable requirements meets these needs.

       urlLink Gentoo Linux Documentation -- Keychain   "Many of us use the excellent OpenSSH as a secure, encrypted replacement for the venerable telnet and rsh commands. One of OpenSSH's (and the commercial SSH2's) more intriguing features is its ability to authenticate users using the RSA and DSA authentication protocols, which are based upon a pair of complementary numerical 'keys'. And one of the main appeals of RSA and DSA authentication is the promise of being able to establish connections to remote systems without supplying a password. The keychain bash script makes handling RSA and DSA keys both convenient and secure. It acts as a front-end to ssh-agent, allowing you to easily have one long-running ssh-agent process per system, rather than per login session. This dramatically reduces the number of times you need to enter your passphrase from once per new login session to once every time your local machine is rebooted. "

       urlLink HAproxy Page   HAproxy is a high-performance and highly-robust TCP/HTTP load balancer which provides cookie-based persistence, automatic failover, header insertion, deletion, modification on the fly, advanced logging contents to help trouble-shooting buggy applications and/or networks, and a few other features. It uses its own state machine to achieve up to ten thousands hits per second on modern hardware, even with thousands simultaneous connections. It currently lacks SSL and keep-alive, both of which are planned.

       urlLink IronPython - A fast Python implementation for .NET and Mono    IronPython is a new Python implementation targeting the   .NET   and   Mono   platforms. It is...    Fast  - IronPython-0.6 is up to 1.7x faster than Python-2.3 on the standard pystone benchmark. An early performance report is are contained in this paper for PyCon 2004.    Integrated with the Common Language Runtime  - IronPython code can easily use CLR libraries and Python classes can extend CLR classes.    Fully dynamic  - IronPython supports an interactive interpreter and transparent on-the-fly compilation of source files just like standard Python.    Optionally static  - IronPython also supports static compilation of Python code to produce static executables (.exe's) that can be run directly or static libraries (.dll's) that can be called from other CLR languages including C#, VB, managed C++ and many more.    Managed and verifiable  - IronPython generates verifiable assemblies with no dependencies on native libraries that can run in environments which require verifiable managed code.    Not finished  - IronPython is currently at a pre-alpha stage suitable for experimentation but not for serious development work. "

The naming, process definition and API are inspired by interface 1 and 2 as published by the WfMC. The ERD design was made using Designer 9i. PL/FLOW is lightweight because Oracle database functionality is used for storage, indexing and logic. Workflow transactions typically take 5-10 milliseconds to complete.

Identifying these minimum capabilities allows you to identify which existing technologies to use to implement an ESB to support an SOA. By considering how the requirements of a specific situation define the need for additional capabilities, you can then choose the most appropriate implementation technology for that situation.
