         Knoppix : It´s more powerfull than you thought !    I already have this Knoppix CD 6 month ago, but I didn´t use it often.  Lately, I found that somehow this Knoppix just save my life.  It helped me much when my Windows was broken, attacked by virures, and today when I almost lost my internet connection (due to download quota), it helps me again.  Now,  I logged into campus server and run mozilla from console.   No worry about quota anymore :D  Love you KNOPPIX !!!

        Sailing through the Rhine river   My dream comes true. I have been wondering for this about year ago, as I heard about the Loreley story from Deutsche Welle German course.  Not only that, from the ship we also can see many castles, tower and ruins from 16th century.   Below quoted a poetry about the Loreley story, written by a famous German author, Heinrich Heine.   Die Loreley von Heinrich Heine (1823)   Ich weiß nicht, was soll es bedeuten, Daß ich so traurig bin; Ein Märchen aus alten Zeiten, Das kommt mir nicht aus dem Sinn.  Die Luft ist kühl und es dunkelt, Und ruhig fließt der Rhein; Der Gipfel des Berges funkelt Im Abendsonnenschein.  Die schönste Jungfrau sitzet Dort oben wunderbar, Ihr goldnes Geschmeide blitzet, Sie kämmt ihr goldnes Haar.  Sie kämmt es mit goldnem Kamme, Und singt ein Lied dabey; Das hat eine wundersame, Gewaltige Melodey.  Den Schiffer, im kleinen Schiffe, Ergreift es mit wildem Weh; Er schaut nicht die Felsenriffe, Er schaut nur hinauf in die Höh'.  Ich glaube, die Wellen verschlingen Am Ende Schiffer und Kahn; Und das hat mit ihrem Singen Die Loreley getan.    The Lorelei (English Version) by Heinrich Heine, 1823   (note: English version NOT translated by me)  I cannot tell why this imagined  Sorrow has fallen on me  The ghost of an unburied legend  That will not let me be.   The air is cool, and twilight  Flows from the quiet Rhine;  A mountain alone in the high light  Catches the faltering shire.  One rosy peak half gleaming  Reveals, enthroned in air,  A goddess lost in dreaming  Who combs her golden hair.   With a golden comb she is combing  Her hair as she sings a song;  Heard and reheard in the gloaming  It hurries the night along.   The boatman has heard what has bound him  In throes of a strange, wild love.  He is blind to the reefs that surround him,  Who sees but the vision above.   And lo, the wild waters are springing -  The boat and the boatman are gone...  Then silence. And this with her singing,  The Lorelei has done.

        Trip to Trier   Trier, the oldest city in Germany and also known as second Rome.  Because of eastern holidays, a lot of friends, didn´t join us. There were only 6 master-plus students, 7 Erasmus students, and  3 other from IntClub. Unfortunately there was also no guide, blurry fotocopied map and some papers were the only things we have !   As we separated at Porta Nigra (Rome´s gate, about 2000 years old), we walked to Hauptmarkt to begin our journey :p  Then Nicole (from IntClub) joined and guided us to Trier´s Dom. Like usual, we took pictures (the most important things to do, right ? :P)  even inside the dom and the cemeteries. It was funny cause I thought that the cemetery was a park. After that, the trip continued to Basilika and Kurfürstlich Palais. Basilika is a church of Kaiser Konstantins, which is build just behind his palace. Next station, Kaiserthermen, ruins of  Rome´s emperor´s hot bath (Warmbadesaal). We just passed through Thermen am Viehmarkt, another ruins of hot bath, on way to Karl Max Haus.    Dying for hungry, we considered to find a place to take rest and have lunch. The street was so crowded with locals and tourists who have lunch or just drink beer. While looking around we found Brunnen and Judengasse. At last we found bench, sunny and facing to Porta Nigra, so nice !   Still have about one hour after lunch, we back to Hauptmarkt to find more places such as Dreikönigenhaus,  Rotes Haus and Frankenturm.  Finally the time was over,  we must back to Kaiserslautern.    Windows installation  a night long :((

        Many things happened...   Morning, wash the clothes in Alcatraz, after that just stuck in my room and do some work on programming, but not yet finished until now :( In the aftenoon (accompany with Joe) I  bought cutie pinky folder and some other stationaries also with beautiful colors.  After that  went to the German class in the evening and I was late to catch the bus to home, so I and Lei Ling have to wait for more 1/2 hour.  At home I cooked `gorengan´ and got my internet repaired by a friend. :P  hahaha... today my writing seems like German homework in Perfect Tense :P

        Saturday night   Alone again on this night....  I found the song : She believes in me from Kenny Rogers, very deep meaning then... feel so mellow....    She believes in me   While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs And sometimes all the nights can be so long And it’s good when I finally make it home, all alone While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light And quietly she says how was your night? And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight  And she believes in me, I’ll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world With my little songs, I was wrong But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right I will find a way, find a way...  While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite Then I see my old guitar in the night Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there’s no end While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two And I’m torn between the things that I should do And she says to wake her up when I am through, God her love is true...  And she believes in me, I’ll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world With my little songs, I was wrong But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right I will find a way, while she waits... while she waits for me!

       Since last week I have a TV. Not new but old, as inheritance of one of my friend who leaves this city.   I am really happy for it because I can watch a lot of tv-series, films and some reality shows . It help to improve my German, but also took a lot of my time instead. Na ja, everything have both good and bad side isn't it ?

       This article is taken from www.howstuffworks.com  If there is water in a heated container and the water is boiling (at 100°C or 212°F), the container will maintain a constant temperature. As soon as all of the liquid water has evaporated (all of the water is absorbed by the rice), the temperature inside the container immediately rises. The appliance has a thermostat that can detect when the temperature rises above 212°F in the container, and it turns itself off.

       Mildew can grow fastly anywhere, in nature and also inside our house. In the nature, it has important task which is decomposing organism substance. But inside the house, high concentrate of mildew could be dangerous for our health, because of its poison. Mildew live in environment with high humidity. To avoid mildew we have to control the humidity inside the house always under 60%.  In winter, we can do 'crush ventilate' by open all windows and door very wide for short time (5-15 minutes). No sense to tilt the windows all the day. It will loose a lot of energy and the house would be very cold, but the chance of mildew growth would be bigger.

       Today we did experiment on stochastic. It is quiet new for me since I never learn about it before. It deals with probability in random area. I didn`t understand completely about the experiment but I've got some idea of autocorrelation. Autocorrelation is simply convolution of two same signals (one of them is shifted) over its period. Autocorellation of sine signals will output cosine signal and autocorrelation of rectangle signals will result triangular signal.   One implementation we did is to find velocity (in rpm) of the machine with help of noise sound from machine that was recorded on casette. The signals are autocorrelated, and the output will have the same periode of the signal itself. With the period finally we can calculate the velocity of the machine.
