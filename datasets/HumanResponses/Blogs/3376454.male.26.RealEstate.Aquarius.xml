Wahaha!&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Yeah, more neoprint! &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    This is a picture taken 2 and a half year back at Angelia's 21st birthday. Went to ate a 8 course dinner at Cystal Jade Ngee Ann City. &nbsp; urlLink

      11 days since i last post anything. I bet nobody know that my blog exist at all in this pathetic world. Life sucks!  Far East Organisation sucks! Dorothy Chan sucks! Ms Ng sucks!     urlLink    Far East Organisation is the company that I am working in. Well, its in a mess, employees are often ill-treated. Shucks man!&nbsp; urlLink     Angelia, my girlfriend a.k.a Miss Kacheek complained that I never tell her about my blog. Yeah! My fault! She bugging me to give her attention all day and night. What to do?!?! She's biting my arm right now! Ouch! She trying to make up by kissing my ass, oops, my arm that's what i mean.    urlLink    This is my dear Miss Kacheek! Now you seen her, don't ever be surprised if you see her on the streets! Haha!&nbsp; urlLink

      Well, this is my 1st posting on my 1st ever blog! Yeah man! Kena influenced by people around me who have their own blog.. I cannot be left out right?  I wonder if there will be any one that is keen to look at my blog at all. Wonder if i can be as famous as xiaxue's blog (http://www.xiaxue.blogspot.com). I may not be as sacastic or eloquent as her.. but then, i bite! Yeah!  By the way, its a damned fucking boring day for me today! Cheese man, I can't believe I managed to stay at home the whole fucking day today.. not stepping out of my house. I got a "pointed" buttock.. I can't sit down long without doing anything..   Why I have to stay at home today is becos I injured my lower back again! I managed to hurt myself during my soccer session last Sunday. Got 2 days of MC. Tomorrow got to go back to work. Cheese man. My body alignment still not back to normal yet. Look very weird as my body is slantd to the left. Got lots of earful from my "kacheek" about the danger of soccer as well as no more Fathers' day! Seems like i got to semi retire once again.  I think I've posted enuff for today. Will be exploring how to make this blog a more interesting one..   Cheers, Jerome Lee [18 May 2004]

       urlLink    This is Liverpool, the English Premier League club that I supported since 1990, the most decorated side in England. Manchester United is so far lagged behind! &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    This is the current Liverpool team for season 2003-2004. They managed to finish 4th position after Arsenal, Chelsea and Man Utd. Emile Heskey and Gerard Houllier already left the club though. I love the club's humble, no arrogrant approach, Steven Gerrard as well as their ever boring playing style. Wahaha!&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    This is currently my favourite player, one of the most outstanding player in the world right now. Definitely better than David Beckham. Captain of Liverpool FC. I like his style of play. His no nonsense, full committment and powerful play is delightful to watch. Steven Gerrard will be the one to watch out for during England's Euro 2004 campaign. &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Michael Owen, need any introduction? I bet not! Well, this is the wonderkid that explore into the world soccer scene during the 1998 World Cup. Scored the wonder solo goal against Argentina during the Quarter Finals. Remember? Now he is one of the most lethal striker in the world, sought after by most big clubs in Italy and Spain. I do hope he will score the goals that brings them all the way to the Euro 2004 Final to win the tournament. &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    One of the up and coming striker in Liverpool. Score a couple of goals this season. Wonderful ability to dribble the ball, bring a different dimension to Liverpool game. Will be one of the player to watch out for in Czech Republic's Euro 2004 campaign. &nbsp; urlLink

      As suggested by the title above, I've a super duper sian 1/2 day in office. You want know what happened? It's all because of the stoopid management at where else but Far East Organisation. In brief, I shall highlight what exactly happened..  Got an expat couple client from England who wanted to rent a four bedroom unit at Townerville (as shown by some photos below). One of their main concern is to shift the existing air conditioner compressor from the courtyard to somewhere at the back of the house. My stoopid Leasing Director initially agreed to that, and I informed my dear tenant of the good news. However, today, the stoopid Leasing Director told me during the meeting that it can't be done as the even stoopider Executive Director disagreed. The reason why? The management unwilling to fork out the $1250 to pay the air-con contractor. Fucked up right?!?!   As expected, my client kicked up a fuss at Townerville today, me got to pacify them for one hour. Sian 1/2. Made me wonder if I should continue to work at that stoopid Fucked-up company!   urlLink    This is some pictures that I lifted from Far East's website. Nice hor?&nbsp; urlLink

      Today is Friday, 4th June 2004. Today is Ms Kacheek's 3rd exam paper. Hopefully she will pass. I worked half day today only. Gone to Ms Kacheek's house to accompany her. But then, I ended up neglecting her. Why? I played Counter-Strike on her computer the whole of the afternoon till 8pm. Ms Kacheek was very the understanding and did not blame me. Hehe.    urlLink    This is a picture I "kapo" from some Counter-strike websites. Hope they won't sue me ya? By the way, that picture is Ms Kacheek in the counter-terrorist attire. Chio? &nbsp; urlLink     By the way, I love to play counterstrike a lot. Started playing it since 2000. 4 years liao! Started off playing with my classmates from SIM at LAN shops in Beauty World Shopping Centre and Sixth Avenue. Then started playing at those filty McMaster LAN shops all over Singapore. Spent at least $5.00 on each session. Estimated spending at least $2000-$3000 on playing the game. Can say that I'm slightly addicted. Need to play at least once a week. Nowadays played with my colleagues Brandon and Chyi Feng in LAN shop @ Park Lane. Me "pro" and they are "freefrag" Wahaha! I not haolian leh.. 4 years of collective experience won't be that bad right?

      Supposed to go to snokerling at Phi Phi Island. Was postponed due to "bad" weather. The forcasted rainy weather turns out to be a false one. Went to Phuket town instead. Took a minibus chartered from our hotel.  &nbsp;   urlLink     Me and Ms Kacheek posing in front of a "tuk tuk"&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink    We are "conned" to go to the"Duty Free Shop" somewhere along the way to Phuket town. Nothing seems to be cheap or attractive there.. Can't wait to get out of there. &nbsp; urlLink

      It has been a long long wait since me and Ms Kacheek last left Singapore for an oversea trip. Last went to Seoul in July 2003. Phuket, here we come!  &nbsp;   urlLink     Me and Ms Kacheek on the plane to Phuket! Yeah!&nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Touched down on Phuket around 4pm.&nbsp;A 1 hour journey on&nbsp;a mini-bus to our hotel at Patong Beach. Went to find food and wander around Patong Beach. A bit scary as we don't know our way around. Had first time experience trying to bargain. &nbsp;    urlLink   &nbsp; urlLink    Ms Kacheek having beef bee hoon at a roadside stall&nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   urlLink     Me having pork bee hoon.. yummy man! Added lots of chilli powder. Hot man! Kept perspiring!&nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;    urlLink     Ms Kacheek posing in front of the roadside stall.. its looks so unhygenic hor? But the food is great!&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink     Took a snapshot of the night market.. looks happening? Things there are damned ex man. Chop veggie head! Need a lot of bargaining skills!&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink     This is the famous Banana chocolate pancake that is available from Phuket only. Super yummy man! Super sweet! Nice nice! Still thinking of it right now! Cheap Cheap! 25 Baht only! &nbsp; urlLink       urlLink     It looks like the roti prata that we can find everywhere in Singapore.. But it taste so unique.. yum yum!&nbsp; urlLink
