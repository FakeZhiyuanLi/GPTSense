Keep in mind that I mean nothing except love and question by these words...     Lately, you have seemed really distant, I hardly even talk to you anymore! and we don't e-mail like we used to either.  Was it something I did or said? Or do you just feel the need for some distance? (i can totally understand that) Whatever the reason, I hope you can tell me and I hope I haven't offended you in any way. Please write back in complete honesty.                                                                                          Your friend,                                                                                                                                                                                            Sara    my response:    dear sara~   I really appreciate that you talked to me about this, I know things have felt disant lately and It's me....because I just felt like I didn't really fit in with you guys anymore...like I wasn't a part of something anymore just watching what was happening and wishing I could be a part of it...but sort of not wanting to be a part of it...it's sorta confusing so you probably don't understand but it's ok...and please know I am REALLY glad that you brought it up....I'm NOT offended : )   Taylor  isn't that precious?

Joes  where i got neeeew shoes!!!!!  they are awesome   they're Rod Lavers  they were half of of $60   but i had to pay for them  they are white and tan and dr. blue  they are sooooo cool  and then i tried on some underarmour shirts because marc and eric have been bugging me to try them because they are really great for sports since they keep you warm and are like really really tight so they don't restrict you  anyway...i loved them sooooo much!! they are so comfy and soft   but one shirt was like $35 so i didn't get one........because soccer season isn't for another 3 months  then we went to walmart  where i got some really tasty fries  and my sister was looking at all this neat mary-kate and ashley stuff so was like sitting in the middle of the girls section eating fries  it probably looked really weird  and then my mom was like looking for jewelry because it's soooo cheap there and she just wanted some she didn't have to care about so she's like "taylor pick me out some jewelry, you know all about it..."  so i was like ok!!  we got her some pearls, a gold necklace (very plain) and a detailed silver one.. so she can layer so that's she's en vogue  then i got a thumb ring that says "#1 Dad" on it   it's pretty awesome and i got these sweet Jackie O. glasses for only 4 bucks  they are like huge circles   i look so hip!  j/k  then i got a pink belt with polka dots on it for only 4 bucks  walmart is soooo cheap  then my dad was in the mens section and i found this shirt that was a 4X it was soooo big  so i put it on of course!  it came down to almost my knees and the sleeves were like too my wrists  it like a dress!!  i wanted to get it but then my dad was like "you'll never wear it" and i wouldn't ever wear it so i left it...  then i wore my glasses to this other store and ppl were like looking at me funny  it was cool  then we came home and i watched tennis, 1st match was : Ferdero vs. Kuerter  kuerter won  then it was S. Williams vs. some really bad chick  and Williams won  her match was 6-0, 5-4  haha  then i watched V. Williams vs. another really bad chick  her match was 6-1,6-2  yeah  then i was doing the dishwasher right? and i kept hearing all this like thumping and squeaking and grunting down the hall by the shoes  so i was like 'ugh stupid cat"  so i went down there and he had his head in my dad's shoe   and so picked him up and tossed him to the side and i looked in his shoes and there was like this tail wiggling around everywhere  so i ran upstairs to my sister who was in the laundry room hanging up clothes and i was like (in my shout whisper voice, because my parents were sleeping) "ZOEY THERE'S A MOUSE IN DAD'S SHOE!!!!!!!"  so then i ran to my parents room and i woke them up and my dad comes to his shoe and looks in it and he's like "what the heck"  then he stomped the shoe!!!!!!!!!  because mice like eat everything and they have diseases  then he threw it out and it was a baby chipmunk  then we all felt really bad...  wah poor thing  then my mom and sister were like "hey wasn't jasper chasing something around LAST NIGHT???!!!!"  oh ew that chipmunk had been in our house since yesterday  doing who knows what...  oh ew oh ew OH EW  MLS soccer in an hour!

PARIS -- Second seed Andy Roddick slumped out of the French Open on Wednesday in a shocking five-set defeat by Frenchman Olivier Mutis.       Mutis won 3-6, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-2, as the U.S. Open champion found himself outplayed under darkening Paris skies.   Roddick's erratic effort showed he's still learning how to play on clay. He blew an easy volley to lose serve in the opening game of the final set, then began to play too aggressively. He became increasingly dispirited as his mistakes mounted and fell behind 5-0.   "I was waffling," Roddick acknowledged. "I wasn't decisive enough. I wasn't sticking with things I wanted to do."    Mutis, a 26-year-old Frenchman ranked 125th, served his 10th ace to close out the victory. It was just the second five-set win of his career, and it delighted the small crowd watching the final match of the day at Court Suzanne Lenglen.   Mutis, who advanced to the third round of a major event for the first time, said the win was the biggest of his career.   "I really enjoyed myself," he said. "I hope to go farther."   Mutis, who had not won a match this year prior to the tournament, mixed up his play superbly to undo Roddick, 21, in a see-saw encounter and sealed victory with an ace after 3 hours, 11 minutes.   "He was a different player the latter part of the match than he was at the beginning," Roddick said. "That was my fault that I let him back into the match."   Cool, damp evening conditions cost Roddick some of his power. He hit 15 aces but lost his serve nine times.   Roddick's second-round appearance, although not his best effort in Paris, which was the third round in 2001, was an improvement after losing in the first round the past two years.   The exit of Roddick, who has been suffering from a stomach upset, meant the United States has no representatives left in the men's singles draw.   No. 27-seeded Vince Spadea was also beaten, leaving no American in the men's draw midway through the second round. Spadea, who erased nine match points in a first-round victory, lost to Julien Jeanpierre 6-4, 6-2, 7-5.   The next highest seed at No. 3, Guillermo Coria overcame a slow start to beat qualifier Juan Monaco 7-5, 6-1, 6-3.    Coria, a semifinalist last year, lost four of the first five games and needed more than an hour to pull out the first set. He rallied from a service break down in the third set.   "I knew it would be a difficult beginning to the match, that he would give me everything he had," Coria said. "I finished the match very well, and I'm playing well."    Coria had 29 winners and just 25 unforced errors against fellow Argentine Monaco, who was playing in his first Grand Slam tournament. Monaco was hurt by 10 double faults but kept Coria the court for nearly 2½ hours.    A French Open junior champion in 1999, Coria is seeking his first Grand Slam title. He has won 33 of his past 34 clay-court matches, with the only loss to top-ranked Roger Federer in this month's Hamburg final.   "I know there are difficult matches ahead," Coria said. "Everyone is here to win, as am I."   Former French Open champion Carlos Moya took just 78 minutes to clinch a bittersweet victory over fellow Spaniard and best friend Fernando Vicente at Roland Garros on Wednesday.   The 27-year-old won 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 for his 11th straight victory against Vicente to stroll into the French Open third round.   "Well, it's not easy. He's my best friend on the tour, and I know he's having a hard time now because he was injured for a long time," Moya said.   Having lost all 10 previous matches against Moya, Vicente appeared to merely go through the motions on Court Suzanne Lenglen and never looked like denting the baseliner's game.   Moya seemed unable to look his friend in the eye during the the one-sided contest.   "Well, what I can say is I didn't have fun at all today, although I played a very good match and I won in straight sets playing solid," Moya said.   Moya, champion in Paris in 1998, is seeded fifth this time round and faces Dutchman Raemon Sluiter next.   No. 9 Tim Henman marched through to the third round with a 6-0, 6-3, 6-3 demolition of Germany's Lars Burgsmueller.   The ninth-seeded Henman wrapped up the first set in only 20 minutes with a near-flawless display of shotmaking and Burgsmueller, ranked 91st, was never in contention after that.   Henman plays Spanish clay specialist Galo Blanco in the third round.    In other men's play, two-time runner-up Alex Corretja, beat No. 13 Paradorn Srichaphan 6-4, 7-5, 6-3. No. 22 Juan Ignacio Chela defeated Fernando Verdasco 7-5, 6-2, 6-2.

      Did London receive a Hawaiian Punch on ‘Idol’? Fans complain the show may be racist, rigged or both La Toya London was ousted from "American Idol" Wednesday.   Although “American Idol” contestant Jasmine Trias of Oahu, Hawaii, flubbed her performance this week, it was favorite London whom viewers sent packing.  An anguished “Why?” rose from the ranks of her fans and bewildered “American Idol” judges, as it did when another standout contestant, Jennifer Hudson, was booted off last month.  If Wednesday’s results are an indication of the unpredictability of U.S. voters, Ralph Nader might consider measuring the Oval Office for new curtains.  Maybe it was simply the result of overwhelming Hawaii support for a native daughter. Others, however, raised the bleak possibility of racism or a misguided system that allows multiple votes.  “American Idol” producers and Fox issued a statement Thursday defending the show.  “The producers and network have gone to great lengths to insure the integrity of the voting process on ‘American Idol.’ America votes, an independent company calculates the tally, and the show reports those results,” the statement said.  Left standing in the Fox talent contest are Trias, Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo. The finale is May 25-26, when one singer wins the “Idol” crown and a record contract.  Acerbic judge Simon Cowell, who had called Tuesday’s disco-song performance by Trias “really average karaoke,” had suggested there was one chance for her survival.  “You better hope that every household in Hawaii has at least five telephones, because you’re going to need all the support you can get,” Cowell told a tearful Trias.  One phone company’s records might hold clues to why her weeping proved unwarranted.  Of the 29 states in Verizon’s local territory, only New York and California logged more calls on its network than Hawaii after the show, a Verizon spokesman said Thursday. California and New York are among the most populous states in the nation; Hawaii is among the least.  It’s possible there was a regional factor beyond state pride. Because of the time difference — Hawaii is six hours behind the East Coast — viewers might enjoy a later, less-crowded calling period to cast votes.  When London ended up the loser, she exited with a poised, powerhouse rendition of the Barbra Streisand standard “Don’t Rain on My Parade.”  “I will see you again,” she told the audience.  Could it be racism? Could it be rigged? The most unsettling speculation centered on the possibility of racism, which was also raised when Hudson lost viewer support. Both London and Hudson are black.  Even pop star Elton John, who has participated in the show, said recently that he suspected racial bias was a factor in the voting.  In Internet chatter and conversation Thursday, fans of the show speculated that race may have been a factor in the first year’s early elimination of Tamyra Gray — and with the recent votes. Some said their opinions were unaltered by last season’s victory by Ruben Studdard, who’s black.  In contrast to the show’s vote, an AOL online poll that attracted 300,000 votes this week had London the likely winner. Before Wednesday’s show, 47 percent of the votes picked London as the next “American Idol,” followed by Barrino with 26 percent, DeGarmo with 21 percent and Trias with 6 percent.  It’s unusual for the ongoing survey to be so out of whack with the show’s results, said an AOL spokeswoman. In the week that Hudson was voted off, for example, she was ranked low in the online poll.  Fox, which releases scant voting data, declined Thursday to provide a geographical breakdown on the count. That reticence, which once seemed merely coy, now looks obstinate and isn’t helping to satisfy unhappy fans.  “It is rigged,” one disgruntled person proclaimed in an online posting, dismissing Trias as untalented and lauding the so-called “three divas,” Barrino, London and Hudson. The writer didn’t expand on who might be interfering with the vote, or why.  Others expressed concern about the voting system, which allows viewers to repeatedly call in for their favorite. The audience determines the contest’s outcome, with the three-judge panel only providing commentary after having narrowed the field early in the contest.  “On voting, my cousins and I tried to vote for La Toya ... None of us were able to get through,” one viewer said in an online posting.  Wrote another: “I’ve been saying this for sometime and now I am sure everyone will agree. The voting system is wrong. It should be one vote per phone or computer.”  Others said they’re intending to abandon the show because of the voting difficulty.  More theories abounded, including speculation that London’s personality (one online posting chided her for a “cold demeanor”) hurt, or that the talented Barrino and London somehow split the vote.  An “Idol” and La Toya fan from across the border, 34-year-old Rick Broadhead of Toronto worried Thursday that the show’s credibility could be hurt if a lesser performer ultimately wins the title.  “I could see (judge) Randy Jackson walking away, saying, ‘I don’t want to be associated with this,” Broadhead said.

      John Stevens, the red-headed crooner who was ousted from "American Idol," returned to high school Friday and said he's still hoping to get a record deal. "As of now, I've received no offers besides just singing at weddings and other local events," he said.  Stevens, 16, looked slightly embarrassed as Williamsville East High School principal Neal Miller declared Friday "John Stevens Day" in front of 1,000 students at an assembly.  "Sing us a song, Johnny!" a few students shouted.   He smiled but didn't oblige.  Since being voted off the Fox television talent show about two weeks ago, the lanky teenager has crooned with Regis Philbin, bantered with David Letterman and come face-to-face with look-alike Conan O'Brien.

      SHE IS FINALLY  GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   you know who she is, serena KILLED her in 45 minutes this fine morning, 6-1 6-1   that's right!!!!  i was so excited  but before that a sad moment came to pass  tim henman had lost his match, it was very sad because an Englishman hasn't won his own countries tournament (wimbledon) in like 50 years i think  so it made it very sad  oh well he'll be back next year!  tomorrow is Sharapova and Davenport  *deep breath*  she must win  she=sharapova  i heart maria!  so today i cleaned the house, and i am going to go play tennis as soon as it cools off  it's HOT  picture of the day:  hmmm i am waiting for it to download so i will tell you what is after the picture!!  an article about serenas very lovely match today against   her  i love posting articles, its only so i can look back on them and not lose them.     haha my pictures are now all tennis ones....who would've guessed  well this one is certainly....uh...interesting  yeah that's all i'll say  now for an EX-citing article!     Associated Press WIMBLEDON, England --   Consider Serena Williams back, good as ever. Hey, she does.  Her body's pain-free, her mind's at ease, her strokes sting, her serves zing.   Finally facing what was billed as a true test, Williams downright dominated Jennifer Capriati 6-1, 6-1 Wednesday to reach a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time since winning her second straight Wimbledon title last year.   "It's been a really hard 12 months for me," Williams said. "I'm feeling really good for the first time since I've been back. And so that's what I'm most excited about."   That's bad news for her next opponent, No. 4 Amelie Mauresmo, who reached her second Wimbledon semifinal by beating No. 9 Paola Suarez 6-0, 5-7, 6-1. Thursday's other semifinal is No. 5 Lindsay Davenport vs. No. 13 Maria Sharapova.   Davenport, the 1999 Wimbledon champion, and Williams are the only remaining players to have won a major title. Williams is bidding to become just the third woman in 35 years to claim three straight championships at the All England Club.   "It's been something on my mind since the beginning of the tournament," said Williams, who hasn't lost a set, dropping only 17 games through five matches.   Her first four matches came against unseeded players, and three-time Slam champion Capriati might as well have been.   "I don't think I really had much of a chance to get into the match and play. I was just feeling so much pressure from her coming off the baseline, the serve," No. 7 Capriati said. "Her game plan was to tee off on everything, and she was on."   It's been a while since Williams was at the top of her game; she slid from No. 1 to No. 10 in the rankings.   She had left knee surgery Aug. 1, less than a month after beating her sister Venus in the final at the All England Club. Then, in September, their half-sister Yetunde was shot to death. Some have wondered whether Serena should devote less time to her nascent acting career and fashion designing. And there are questions about how good she and Venus could be if they sought outside coaching, instead of relying on their parents.   All appears right in Serena's world these days, though.   "I'm bending for balls, and I'm not having any pain," she said. "I'm running without having any doubt in my mind. So that's been a real big plus for me, not only mentally, but physically, as well."   Williams returned to the tour in March, winning her first tournament. But since then, she had gone 10-3, failing to reach a semifinal anywhere, until now. Two of those losses were to Capriati, including at the French Open.   "Everyone, at some point in their career, is beatable," Williams said. "It's just a matter of staying humble."   Entering Wednesday, she held a 9-6 edge over Capriati, with 11 matches going three sets. All five at majors had gone the distance, but this time Williams needed just 45 minutes to put Capriati away.   And she took control early. At 1-1, Williams earned five break points, wearing Capriati down with brilliant returns until she double-faulted to cede the game.   There was a glimmer of hope in the second set for Capriati, though. Williams double-faulted twice in a row -- she had two double-faults all tournament to that point -- to allow Capriati to pull within 2-1.   Williams threw her head back and rolled her eyes.   Plenty of players would have a hard time getting past those miscues. Not Williams.   No nerves, not a shred of shrinking confidence.   She immediately ended what little suspense there was by winning eight straight points to make it 4-1.   "I try not to doubt myself when I'm on the court at all," said Williams, who raised her tournament ace total to 36 by hitting three and served at up to 119 mph.   Capriati, in contrast, complained that she was bothered by the media's attention on their rivalry.   "It's very hard to just go out there and completely focus on tennis. I can't walk around with earplugs in," she said. "Maybe if you wouldn't talk about it so much, it would have been a better match."   That's doubtful, given how well Williams played, and what little fight Capriati showed. Plus, this is Wimbledon, where Williams has won 19 straight matches. Her forceful strokes get some extra oomph on the grass, where balls skid instead of bounce, giving foes less time to get to the right spot.   "It's pretty tough to play against Serena, because in one or two shots, it's done," Mauresmo said, snapping her fingers, "especially on that surface. You have to be very focused and ready from the first shot to handle her game."   Capriati certainly wasn't.   Andy Roddick, who beat Sjeng Schalken 7-6 (4), 7-6 (9), 6-3 to reach the semifinals, was asked if he watched Williams-Capriati.   "No. I was in the bathroom," he said. "I came out, and it was done."   and i come to find out LINDSEY got back last night!!! KARSEN YOU TOLD ME SHE WOULDN'T BE BACK FOR TWO WEEKS  *sigh*  oh yes! quote of the day!  Envy is the ulcer of the soul. Socrates (469 BC - 399 BC)  that is very true and deep.  i like serious quotes  what else to say?  I dOn'T kNoW  haha that was random

A: Theloneous Monk     Michael Jordan     King Tubby     Bruce Lee     Bob Marley   Q: Do you do anything special to warm up before a show?  A: Jack and I usually just play a couple of acoustic guitars, and Adam keeps the beat on anything in his reach.   Q: What are some other projects you've worked on?  A: Heiroglyphics (w/ Del the Funky Homosapien)     Dan the Automator     Stimulated Dummies     Ben Lee's Something Borrowed Something Blue   Q: Are you working on any new projects now?    A: Josh Haden and Dan The Automator's new records.  I'm also working on a project called 'Tropikal' it's mainly some mellow hip-hop instrumental grooves.   Q: What's spinning in your cd player these days?  A: Rhythm & Sound 'Rhythm & Sound'     De La Soul 'AOI: Bionix'     Trojan Dub Box Set (Newest Vol.)     Studio One Story DVD     Boards of Canada 'Twoism: Reissue'         Q: Where did you grow up?

Ipina, Mike Ellison, and the fragrantly pleasing Miles Perlich will be throwing down serious rumbas (barring any band mutinies).  Jack and Merlo will be forced at gunpoint to add to the groove.  Hopefully Justin and Raul from Ozomatli will join in the fun as well.   Q: What other music are you into?  A: The Meters     The JB's     A Tribe Called Quest     Bob Marley     Lee "Scratch" Perry     Dexter Gordon     Theloneous Monk     Cachao     Los Munequitos     Fela Kuti with Tony Allen     Tommy Guerrero   Q: What bands have you played with that inspire you?

      Donald Young, 14, a true professional  By Pete Williams, special for USA TODAY TAMPA — If 14-year-old tennis prodigy Donald Young was hoping for a low-key professional debut on Tuesday, he got his wish. Only two dozen people watched Young drop an opening-round match on the USTA's pro circuit 4-6, 4-6 to Robert Yim, a 19-year-old ranked 485th on the ATP Tour.   Most of the media at the Harbour Island Athletic Club & Spa were on hand to interview Antonio Tarver, the new WBC light heavyweight champion, who works out at the facility.  That was fine with Young, who appears to be following the same career trajectory as talented 14-year-olds such as soccer's Freddy Adu and golf's Michelle Wie. In April, facing opponents four years older, Young became the youngest player to win the Easter Bowl boys' 18 singles title in Palm Springs, Calif.      Rising tennis star Donald Young, born July 23, 1989, joins some high-profile 14-year-olds:  Name  Birthdate  Claim to fame  Freddy Adu  June 2, 1989  D.C. United pro called the future of soccer.  Michelle Wie  Oct. 11, 1989  Golf amateur has played a PGA Tour event and placed high in LPGA events.  Daniel Radcliffe  July 23, 1989  Actor plays Harry Potter in the hit movie series.              He has been compared to fellow lefty and former No. 1 Marcelo Rios because of his quick hands and coordination. Some USTA officials mention him in the same breath as Pete Sampras. John McEnroe inscribed a copy of his autobiography, "To Donald: All the way to No. 1."  Others have a difficult time drawing a comparison. Ambidextrous, Young has an uncanny ability to improvise shots. He played two-handed until three years ago, when he went lefty.  Though just 5-10 and 145 pounds, he hits the ball with power on the run, effectively creating offensive shots from neutral or defensive positions.  "With the kind of shots he creates, you wonder sometimes if he's a scientist or a tennis player," says veteran tennis coach Nick Bollettieri, who occasionally assists Young's primary coach, his mother Illona. "It's not a question of ability but whether he can physically play with men."   Young, a Chicago native who moved to Atlanta in January when his parents relocated their youth tennis academy, took advantage of a new rule allowing professionals to play in USTA junior events. He still can compete for USTA juniors titles, some of which include automatic berths in ATP events, while still pursuing endorsement income. By turning pro, it means Young will be ineligible for NCAA tennis.  Young signed with the IMG agency in December. He wore Nike clothing from head to toe on Tuesday and has used Head rackets for years, though no endorsement deals have been signed.  "The goal is to not throw him in there too quickly," says Olivier van Lindonk, one of his two IMG representatives.  Life as a pro hasn't brought about too much change in the Young household. Donald Sr. missed his son's pro debut, staying in Atlanta to run the Tennis in Motion Academy. As for Donald Jr., who is home-schooled, the biggest difference is facing opponents hellbent on not losing to a kid.  Against Yim, the reigning USTA boys 18s champion, Young recovered from a 4-2 deficit to tie the first set 4-4 before losing the next two games.   "I have to stay in the match the entire time," Young said. "I can't drift off. I have to stay serious the whole time. I was a little nervous, but it's all a part of getting used to things."  Yim came away from Young's first pro match impressed. "He's got great hands and can put the ball where he wants. He's obviously talented, but you won't know what that translates to until he gets older."  Young has accepted a wild card into the French Open Juniors and will compete in the 18-and-under event less than two months before his 15th birthday.   By winning the Easter Bowl, he's earned slots in the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport, R.I., from July 5-11 and the Mercedes-Benz Cup in Los Angeles a week later.  Illona Young says she's careful not to rush her son. She and her husband have been his only coaches and they won't let him move full time to a tennis academy.   "This is a natural development as far as I can see," she says. "It's been at his request that we're doing what we're doing right now. There's no rush."  Young lists Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan as his favorite sports figures and has met Adu. He says he's comfortable with the high expectations others have placed on him.   "Hopefully, I can be as successful as those guys," he says. "I would rather have the attention if it means I'm playing well. I guess I'll learn to deal with it."

        By Mary Joe Fernandez Special to ESPN.com   WIMBLEDON, England -- Thursday's match between Venus Williams and Karolina Sprem was dramatic. Karolina Sprem hit the ball so hard -- taking it to Venus. Sprem saves set points in the first set. She takes the lead in the second set -- but Venus gets it back. And then in the deciding tiebreak, the chair umpire makes a huge mistake: He awards an extra point to Sprem.   The players were so confused that they went along with it. It's shocking that at Centre Court Wimbledon this can happen, and no one noticed it. You can understand that the players are focused and get confused. But for a linesman or tournament referee to not step up and say, "OK, wait a second" is surprising.    The chair umpire, Ted Watts of Britain, obviously didn't figure it out quickly enough. By now, he has.    At the French Open, Gaston Gaudio was serving to David Nalbandian in a second-set tiebreak. It was 5-2 and Gaudio served from the wrong side. Chair umpire Andreas Egli didn't notice until after the point, which then counted. Nalbandian argued but they played on with Gaudio serving again from the same side. Then Gaudio eventually won the title.    You can say one point shouldn't make a difference in a match -- and if Venus had won the second set, it wouldn't have. However, at a critical stage in the tiebreak, when you're trying to stay in the match, it does. In reality it was only 7-6 in the tiebreak when Sprem won the match.   Venus will probably be more upset that she had set points in the first and second sets and didn't win. She'll be upset that she let this girl control the points and didn't impose her own game.    Venus actually had a good serving day, but wasn't able to mix it up enough. She wasn't able to come to the net and, surprisingly, only had a few winners off the baseline. She's going to have to regroup. She's had a lot of injuries, so she now needs to work on her consistency. However, her biggest obstacle will be her confidence.    This wasn't just a lucky day for Sprem; we will see more of her. She's a talented athlete. She's quick, serves well and hits strongly from the forehand and the backhand. She has no fear. She almost beat Venus about a month ago in Berlin. In the past she's only been able to put together a couple of good points before succumbing to errors. But this time, every time she got tight, she stayed in there. This was the biggest match of her life. She just has to consolidate it. She definitely has the ability to be a top-15 player   yes, i know i have posted like a thousand times on this but it's so IMPORTANT!  haha not really, just to me i suppose

      ok it's like midnight so give me a break  Suspects A-Peel For Justice  02/04/2004 02:21 PM Reuters  Police in Cambodia have been accused of extracting confessions from two teenagers by force-feeding them bananas until they felt sick.   Koh Santopheap newspaper said the pair were subjected to the unorthodox interrogation after being arrested on Sunday night on suspicion of stealing five bags of soap powder from a car parked in the impoverished southeast Asian nation's capital.   However, top Cambodian policeman Yim Simony denied any official wrong doing.   "They were hungry and annoyed and they refused to answer our questions," he told Thursday's edition of the Cambodia Daily. "But after they ate the bananas, they answered the questions."

         w.o.w.  and here is why his picture is on the internet:  Jeopardy Winner Breaks Record Jun 24, 9:59 AM EST  The Associated Press  SALT LAKE CITY -- A Utah man is the new Jeopardy! king, having pocketed more than a half-million dollars during a dominating 16-show run on the quiz show.  Ken Jennings was seen on his 16th straight Jeopardy! episode Wednesday, winning once again to bring his total winnings to $512,959.  The 30-year-old software engineer broke the Jeopardy! record early in his run. Tom Walsh, of Washington, D.C., held the previous mark, earning $184,900 in seven days on the show in January.  Then along came Jennings, who is no stranger to the world of quick quiz.    He was a member of Brigham Young University's successful College Bowl team in the 1990s. Jennings also edits literature and mythology questions for the National Academic Quiz Tournament.  Jennings' Jeopardy! streak is over, though viewers may not realize it. The Jeopardy! episodes featuring him were taped in February, and Jennings is back home in Utah, though he is refusing comment for now.  After the show featured him passing the $250,000 mark last week, Jennings told The Salt Lake Tribune, "It's a little bit like shock, like you can't believe how fast it goes by. Thinking back, it's all just a blur."  Two Jeopardy! rule changes over the years have helped Jennings set the record.  Jeopardy! recently dropped a restriction that limits champions to only five days on the show. The value of the questions are also worth double what they used to be.

      venus williams got beat. by someone who wasn't even STINKING SEEDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!        i am so smad   mad and sad  AND MARDY FISH GOT BEAT   my two favorites are out  now i'm rooting for Anastasia Myskina and Guillermo Coria        wah. and STUPID JENNIFER CAPRIATI WON I HOPE SHE GOES AWAY!!!              AAAAH!!!      and martina navratilova lost      i am so sad      Associated Press WIMBLEDON, England -- With all her injuries and mediocre play of late, the last thing Venus Williams needed was for her opponent to be awarded an extra point.       That's precisely what happened Thursday in the second round at Wimbledon, and Williams lost to Karolina Sprem 7-6 (5), 7-6 (6), the 2000-01 champion's earliest exit at the All England Club since 1997.   In a stunning officiating error at tennis' most hallowed ground, chair umpire Ted Watts awarded the 30th-ranked Sprem a point she didn't earn in the final tiebreaker.   And no one spoke up: not Williams, not Sprem, not the other on-court officials.   "I'd like to think he didn't do it on purpose," said Williams, who hasn't been past the quarterfinals at a major since losing to younger sister Serena in a second straight Wimbledon final last year. "I don't think one call makes a match. I had some opportunities there, and it's unfortunate, but I'll learn from it."   Even after the scoring mistake made it 2-2 in the final tiebreaker, Williams built a 6-3 edge -- then lost five straight points, mostly on miscues. She wasted two set points in the opening tiebreaker.   "Unfortunately, the way it happened, Venus didn't query it at the time," tournament referee Alan Mills said. "They played point after point afterward, and the result, I'm afraid, stands as is."   Both Sprem, a 19-year-old Croatian who lost four straight Grand Slam matches before this week and owns zero tour titles, and Williams appeared confused.   "Sometimes I do lose track of the score, and I just felt that maybe I had lost track again," said Williams, 26-0 against everyone but her sister here since 2000.   It's been some time since she dominated the way she did while winning four majors and rising to No. 1 or while playing Serena in five of six Slam finals. What's tough to tell is how much is a drop in her play or an improvement by others.   Williams missed six months with an abdominal strain, then twisted an ankle while beating Sprem at the German Open in May. She also had to come to terms with the shooting death of half-sister Yetunde in September.   "Sometimes you don't always win," the eighth-ranked Williams said. "So I just feel like I'm going to find out what went wrong, what didn't go right."   Asked if she'll watch a tape of the match to figure out what happened on the scoring foul-up, Williams said: "Guess I should, huh?"   Actually, all of the day's action could be packaged as a video. No matches were played Wednesday, the tournament's first total rainout since 1999, so Thursday featured more than a dozen major champions.   There were two brief rain delays -- what else is new? -- while swirling wind played havoc with balls and sent silverware clattering in the club members' outdoor restaurant overlooking courts.   Some highlights:   Martina Navratilova's first Wimbledon singles competition in 10 years ended with a 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 loss to Gisela Dulko, who beat her at the French Open last month.   Also past Slam winners Jennifer Capriati and Lindsay Davenport and this year's French Open winner, Anastasia Myskina, won. Mary Pierce and Conchita Martinez lost.   For all the excitement and oddities across the 19 courts, nothing could top Williams-Sprem. Sprem confidently matched Williams' power stroke-for-stroke from the baseline, returned impressively, and hit serves at up to 119 mph.   "It's impossible to be a winner or finalist every year," Williams said, her voice cracking. "She played some good tennis."   Williams reacted to lost points by covering her mouth or putting a hand on her forehead, as if wondering, "What's going on?"   But with Sprem serving for the match at 5-3, 30-love, Williams regrouped to win 10 straight points, leading to the tiebreaker.   Williams led 2-1 when Sprem hit a first serve ruled wide by the line judge, who put her arm out and shouted, "Fault!" Williams casually hit the ball over the net, and Sprem smacked a backhand into the open court. Williams stood still at the baseline, figuring it was time for a second serve.   But Watts announced the score as 2-2, the sort of mistake that occurs every so often but generally is corrected right away.   "I don't like seeing an error of that magnitude on Centre Court at the All England Club. Maybe at a $25,000 event," said two-time U.S. Open champion Tracy Austin, who called the match for the BBC. "It's unfortunate for both players. If you're Sprem, you don't want controversy associated with the biggest win of your career."   With the players apparently unaware Sprem received a point she shouldn't have, they lined up again in the same positions for what both thought was a second serve. Indeed, Sprem put a safe, 86 mph offering in, and Williams laced a backhand return winner. That should have made it 3-1 for Williams, but Watts called it 3-2.   "I didn't think about it. I was 100 percent in the match," Sprem said.   After double-faulting to make it 6-3, Sprem erased Williams' first set point with a forehand passing shot. Williams wasted the other two with a double-fault and a forehand error, shrieking as the ball slapped the net to make it 6-6. Sprem went up 7-6 when Williams' awkward volley hit the net tape and dropped back on her side. The match ended on the next point, when Williams sailed a forehand long.   Asked if Williams' status has dropped, the confident Sprem laughed and responded: "Why you say this? Because I beat her?"        *sigh*

      Milk How a wholesome drink became a villain. By Chris Suellentrop Posted Friday, June 18, 2004, at 1:18 PM PT       America's international reputation is as the land of milk and money. Here, milk has long been thought of as not just another nutritious beverage but as purity, even patriotism, in a glass. The title of a recent chronicle of the rise of milk-drinking in America reflects the national view of the beverage: Nature's Perfect Food. "In the U.S., milk is virtually the national emblem (apple pie, in comparison, is an also-ran)," London's Guardian pronounced last year. If pollsters asked such questions, for most of the 20th century milk's favorability ratings would probably have exceeded even water's. In the 1980s, milk was so venerated that a sociologist in the New York Times linked a decrease in its consumption to the declining public faith in all institutions, from the church to the academy to the press to government.  Since then, America's belief in the goodness of milk has taken a darker turn. Milk has turned from a symbol of true-blue Americana into a token of everything that's wrong with the country. As with most cultural changes, the transformation began with extremists, but it has crept into mainstream discourse. Like Hulk Hogan suddenly becoming a wrestling villain, the symbol of saying your prayers and taking your vitamins, of right-thinking Americanness, has now become the bad guy.  These days, milk's chief sin is its cost. In May, the price of dairy products shot up by nearly 7 percent, the largest monthly increase in almost 60 years. Nationally, a gallon of milk runs around $3, and in some places you'll pay nearly $5. Local papers everywhere are running stories bemoaning the high price of milk. West Virginia's Sunday Gazette-Mail listed ways that local residents are stretching their milk dollars: One couple canceled the Sunday paper and switched their long-distance service. One area woman is limiting the amount of milk her children can pour into their cereal. Another pours orange juice over her breakfast. Another woman is buying milk in bulk and freezing the extra. And still another is buying 2 percent milk and adding water to it to turn it into skim milk, though she hasn't confessed the crime to her family. The malaise is obvious. What next, milk lines?  But before milk was too expensive, it was too cheap. Milk was attacked as government-subsidized pork, propped up by economic Stalinism. It's committed other offenses, too. In our health-conscious times, the once-wholesome drink is fingered for fattening kids and clogging arteries. Or is it, as others would have it, corporate poison inserted into the food supply by rapacious Big Business? Or Frankenfood engineered by egomaniacal scientists? Does hormone-altered milk fuel teenage sexuality by causing early puberty in girls? Because Northern Europeans (and Saharan nomads) are about the only people in the world who can digest milk as adults, is it racist?  There's a national frenzy for milk reform. Some think whole milk and 2 percent milk should be banned from schools. The Congressional Black Caucus has blamed the USDA food pyramid for institutionalizing milk in the national diet. Others have sued the federal school-lunch program for racial discrimination for refusing to subsidize nondairy beverages without a note from a doctor. Animal-rights advocates attack dairy farmers for keeping cows in a state of permanent pregnancy and then selling off the calves for veal. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals once put Rudy Giuliani on a billboard with the tag line, "Got prostate cancer?" The author of a book called Milk: The Deadly Poison blamed milk for the death of Florence Griffith Joyner. Even "Got Milk?" is under attack. Some dairy farmers claim that the mandatory payments they must make to fund government-supervised industry advertising is a violation of their First Amendment rights.  These reform movements are reversing a long national tradition. Milk reform began as soon as milk drinking became an entrenched American habit—during the mid-1800s, as Americans moved to cities. But the early reformers wanted Americans to drink more milk, not less. (Milk-drinking is an industrial, urban activity, not a rural one. Before pasteurization, most milk was too dangerous to drink.) As E. Melanie DuPuis, a University of California-Santa Cruz sociologist, details in Nature's Perfect Food: How Milk Became America's Drink, the early reformers blamed rising infant mortality on city life: The new cities, they argued, caused women to become morally degenerate and physically weak, and they transmitted those ailments to the infants they breast-fed. The solution: Feed babies cleaner, purer cow's milk.  For the next 100 years, reformers tried to make milk-drinking more healthful. In the early 20th century, the phrase "the milk question" was shorthand for the dilemma the beverage posed: Americans needed to drink it to improve their health, but because milk carried bacteria and diseases like tuberculosis and typhoid, it was dangerous to imbibe.  Milk's reputation has suffered not because milk is worse today—if anything, it's safer—but because we've changed our attitudes toward other things. We used to like Big Government for protecting public health; now it's robbing our pocketbooks. Before industrial farming raped the countryside, it created a bountiful food supply. And before milk was contemptibly Eurocentric and racist, it was admirably Eurocentric and racist. DuPuis cites a 1920s National Dairy Council publication in which a nutritionist declares, "The people who have achieved, who have become large, strong, vigorous people, who have reduced their infant mortality, who have the best trades in the world, who have an appreciation for art, literature and music, who are progressive in science and every activity of the human intellect are the people who have used liberal amounts of milk and its products." A 1933 history of New York agriculture asserted, "A casual look at the races of people seems to show that those using much milk are the strongest physically and mentally, and the most enduring peoples of the world. Of all races, the Aryans seem have been the heaviest drinkers of milk and the greatest users of butter and cheese, a fact that may in part account for the quick and high development of this division of human beings."  You can't blame milk for being confused. It's getting attacked for exactly the same reasons it was once celebrated. But perhaps the milk skeptics are right—justice may finally be catching up to this innocent-seeming beverage. After all, on the Fourth of July in 1850, President Zachary Taylor dedicated the Washington Monument and spent the day eating cherries and milk. He fell sick. Five days later, he died. For 150 years, milk's gotten away with murder. Isn't that long enough?

      i was just about to delete my post about certain people  but i realized i would want to see it later   to remember my growth  so today  a recap  it was a loooong day  we all got there  then we went to the lames assembly ever held ever!!!  it was so awful  lauren and aaron and christa were busy running off  so i had to stay with marc and eric because i didn't want to get in trouble  needless to say it was highly interesting  so after that we were basically set free  we did whatever we wanted  which was mostly walking/or sitting around  bleh  then at one point marc and i went and made a documentary of zane which was fun we pretended to be spies!  and then i went and sat in the grass with christa aaron and lauren for like 45 minutes  then i got bored so i left and then they disappeared  so marc eric and i looked for them for like 40 minutes  it was depressing  then after the long day i went and saw raising helen with lauren and her friend jordan  me and lauren spent most of the time whining about how sad we were and pretending to sob into our napkins  pretty pathetic if you ask me  but fun  haha  the movie was pretty good  there were only like 12 ppl in the theatre counting lauren jordan and i  most were old ladies  there was one guy  he looked weird  then i came home and i was like looking at ppl with other profiles  and i found laura's  which i read down to field trip day  that all made me sadder  so i went on this giant 2-hour walk and thought about EVERYTHING like the whole year and what happened   when i came back  i found out laura had found my blog and posted and junk  and it might be all sorted out  i guess  i just feel mean and betrayed by *you know who you are*  sigh  uncle albert is playing  my really super favorite song  it has rain  rain makes me happy

Thanks for you lovely comments!!!        &nbsp;    and also mandy, thank you for your comments in my post about Senator Kerry, I liked them!        &nbsp;    anyway, today was very interesting, I went to get my yearbook which for $40 was SO lame, I mean it was like ALL seniors and then freshman class "best" junk was like 6 people, what's up with that? geez, then I went to drivers ed....        &nbsp;    oh. my. gosh. my teacher (mr. wakefield) is like the biggest psychotic person I HAVE EVER MET. ok the class is 2 hours long, and he took 90 minutes talking about        &nbsp;      capturing our good thoughts      throwing out "dangerous" thoughts      how some of us have parents who:      hate us      are divorced      or abuse us      or who just don't understand      then he talked about his personal life which was:      his divorce      his wife cheating on him      how it's not the same with his wife anymore        (keep in mind this is  DRIVERS ED  )         how he has 6 kids, one of whom just graduated from college, one who is a pharmacist, and one who works for him      how he took anti-depressants and then flushed then down the toilet because they made him feel "numb"      how psychiatrists quote "suck"       how much he loves God, which is fine, but were in  DRIVERS ED        how if we don't know what we want to be when we grow up RIGHT NOW we are "thinking dangerous thoughts and wasting our time and lives"       then after all that we watched a 10 minute video, went over the book approximately 5 minutes, and took a STINKING TEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      so, he didn't tell you where ANY of the information was, since it was open book so I got a STUPID 85%      I was so mad.      so I told my parents and they transferred me out of psychopaths class to a lady named Chelsea who Kody says is really cool.      yeah.      then after that we went and dropped our van off at the Toyota place since it was acting funny and went to the stupid mall.      where I got the coolest book!!! it's by this guy who used to work for CBS and it's about how the media is liberally biased, and how people don't realize it and like a million more enlightening things!!!

      Because i just got done watching the Democratic National Convention...  those people, i mean honestly, all they want to do is talk about how awful President Bush is but, they have like NO plan as to how they will make it better.  and then they had hillary clinton on, who in my opinion has done like nothing, she only got elected to the senate for the same reason arnold schwarzennegar sp did, her fame and novelty. and she's like blabbing on and on about yay for stem cell research, which COULD help millions, when in turn millions of helpless babies will be killed, for doing nothing, i mean you can get those same benefits from umbilical cord salvaging....  and then she's all like "yay for families who wanted investigation into 9/11" i'm like "uh, democrats had nothing to do with the families wanting justice..."  then Bill Clinton came on....how can anyone look up to him, the only reason there was peace in his presidency was because he didn't DO anything about terrorist threats. and he was like an adulterer and he commited it right in our white house....  and he's like "make friends we'll have less terror" why would we want to be friends with people who abandoned us when we made the right choices to confront a tyrant, who was threatening us and the rest of the world? that's not going to make us stronger. then he talked about how former presidents made good decisions to make america stronger, and they were like all republicans...*cough*  then they talked about how great the clinton administration was, it's like HELLO JOHN KERRY IS NOT BILL CLINTON!! THEY ARE NOT ONE IN THE SAME!!  i was quite upset after it all.  &nbsp;

      ah wings, something about it just makes me so happy. i don't know why, it's like a man who took a huge setback and made something great out of it, it's inspiring to me.  i just got done reading "Nowhere Man" it was SO depressing, it was about John Lennon 5 years before he&nbsp;was shot, what an empty man....i mean he was into like tarot reading, and he lived his whole life by it, he was like constantly depressed, always punishing himself for having no willpower, and like he always weighed between 135 and 140 for 5 years. always in that range. he was like totally obsessive compulsive about everything. yeah, but isn't that such an empty life? he was always searching for meaning and for truth and for a solid rock foundation, but he never found it, he never found true security or love which is of course in God. who was always waiting for John. and plus he like based his musical life on being better than Paul McCartney, which is pretty sad. anyway the book was sort of crude in places. so i wouldn't reccomend it at all. well maybe if you took out the bad junk  and he was like this obsessive journaler. (sp?). anway he like recorded every meal he ate, what dreams he had, how long he slept each day, stuff like that, and he recorded like every move his son sean made as a child.  well i think that's all, the story just made me quite sad.

      a review on Farenheight 9/11  &nbsp;  To call Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 9/11 a confused mess would be to dishonor confused  messes. It’s basically a lie masquerading as a documentary.   Moore started his “documentary” film career with 1989’s Roger & Me. During that film he perfected his cheap-shot, ambush-interview technique by constantly hounding the then-chairman of General Motors, Roger B. Smith, about why GM closed a car-manufacturing plant in Moore’s hometown of Flint, Mich., thus devastating the region’s economy even while GM allegedly posted record profits.   Ten years and a half-dozen or so films later, Moore created Bowling for Columbine, another supposed piece of nonfiction about gun control and the infamous Denver-area school shootings in 1999. Ignoring the many distortions contained in that film—type “Michael Moore” into Google and you’ll find a whole host of Web sites dedicated to exposing his falsehoods—Hollywood somehow saw fit to award him the 2003 Academy Award for Best Documentary.  That put Moore in a position to now uncover the “truth” about 9/11 and the Bush family ties to Saudi Arabia and the bin Laden family—yes, that bin Laden family. He weaves a self-contradictory web of half-connections, coincidences and sinister music to imply, among other things, that (take a deep breath) the war in Afghanistan was not a retaliatory attack for that country’s harboring of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda but because the Unocal Oil Company, which just happens to have headquarters in Texas, the same state where George W. Bush was governor, wanted to build a natural gas pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf, so the U.S. had to first conquer Afghanistan before moving on to Iraq to facilitate this profit-making venture (whew!).   What he doesn’t reveal is that Unocal pulled out of that deal before 9/11 ever happened. He also doesn’t tell us that the bin Laden family denounced and disowned black sheep Osama. (Sure, we can be suspicious of those claims, too, but Moore never gives us that chance.)  For Slate.com, Christopher Hitchens, a left-leaning journalist, wrote, “To describe [Fahrenheit 9/11] as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability.” He goes so far as to compare Moore to Leni Riefenstahl, who made those gorgeously photographed propaganda films for Adolf Hitler.   Hitchens does a yeoman’s job of disassembling Fahrenheit 9/11, a dissertation on which would be too lengthy for this forum. Sufficient here are a few examples of the cheap tricks Moore employs: He talks about President Bush retiring for the evening on the evening of Sept. 10, 2001, but the image on the screen is one of those Norman Rockwell-ish paintings of a mom tucking her young boy into bed. He also expends a lot of film time showing Bush administration officials preparing for TV interviews, having their faces powdered, their hair combed, and so forth. (Apparently Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz uses his own spit to slick back his hair.)   Moore devotes several more minutes of film to Attorney General John Ashcroft singing a patriotic song. Why? It can’t be because the singing is bad; Ashcroft actually has a nice tenor voice. Maybe it’s because Moore considers him goofy or stupid and assumes we all think the same.   Another trick: In the part of the film leading up to the 2003 Iraq war, Moore shows images of Iraqi children playing, flying kites, etc. Never does he show Saddam’s mass graves, images from his torture videos, and the dead women and children gassed by Saddam’s forces.  He shows a clip of George W. Bush speaking at New York’s Alfred E. Smith Dinner in 2000 where he jokes to the white-tie audience, “I call you the haves and the have-mores. Some call you the elite; I call you my base.” What Moore does not tell you is that then-Vice President Al Gore was a co-guest of honor with Bush at that dinner, and that it’s traditional for politicians to poke fun at themselves at the annual bipartisan charity event sponsored by the Archdiocese of New York. Moore simply presents it as if Bush is buttering up the big-money crowd.  These are all tried-and-true tricks of the trade when it comes to making fictional films. Moore insists he's not creating fiction, but reporting facts. And that makes a huge difference.  Unfortunately for Moore (but providentially for those interested in truth), between his final cut of the film and its release, several things happened that undercut his account. Among them was the 9/11 Commission’s conclusion that nothing sinister was behind the post-9/11 flights that allowed some Saudis and members of the bin Laden clan to leave the United States. In fact, former counterterrorism official Richard Clarke, otherwise held up as a brave hero by Moore, testified that he alone made the decision to allow those flights.   The philosopher Emmanuel Kant said we should never treat human beings as means to an end but only as ends in themselves. Moore isn't listening. Most deeply offensive to me as a veteran is his condescending treatment of the U.S. military. He ostentatiously dedicates the movie to soldiers from Flint who died in the war, but in the film itself treats soldiers and potential recruits as poor idiots who were duped into joining the military only for a leg-up out of the ghetto. The soldiers he interviews in Iraq come across as testosterone-crazed killers.   What should offend everyone is Moore’s letting the camera linger interminably on a mother in deep grief over the loss of her son in Iraq. One quickly senses that he cares less about the mother than the point he wants to make. She and her grief are simply means to his end.  Moore went to great lengths to defend himself before Fahrenheit 9/11 even hit theaters, and has threatened to sue anyone who attacks him or the film. (This from a man who depends on a very generous First Amendment to do what he does for a living.) He asserts every fact in the movie is true. But even if he's right, the overall project can still be a lie.   Harvard professor Sissela Bok dissects lies in all their varieties in the book Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life. In its pages this truth emerges: If I state something that is false but I sincerely believe it to be true, I haven’t lied; I’m merely mistaken. But if I state a number of things that happen to be true but deliberately leave out a single exonerating fact or present information out of context, all with the intent to deceive, I have lied. What then, would Mrs. Bok think of Michael Moore?   For these reasons, Fahrenheit 9/11 is appropriately rated R. Moore appealed the MPAA’s rating, and after being denied, said, “I encourage all teenagers to come see my movie, by any means necessary. If you need me to sneak you in, let me know.” I respectfully suggest otherwise.   wow this could prove to be a controversial post! if you feel the same or differently, make a comment!!!

       what is it with people? why does everyone need a "best" friend?    &nbsp;  i mean what IS&nbsp;a best friend? and how are they so much better than everyone else? sure they know you better but really what about your "close" friends?     &nbsp;  i think that having a best friend is a security blanket for people, it validates them, it makes them think that like they have people who love them and consider them the "best".&nbsp; so they feel worthy? is this true?    &nbsp;  i've only had 2 best friends in my whole life. one was pretty awesome, the other was really cool but ended awkwardly, and it maybe lasted 6 months, the former lasted 7 years.    &nbsp;  hmm and once you've grown apart, when does "best" friends end? who decides when your just friends? is it mutual? or is it one person?    &nbsp;  and do you really NEED&nbsp;a best friend? some people do i think, like they have low self esteem, and they just need to know that someone around them is the "one and only". and some people just grow into it.    &nbsp;  and what if someone decides that your best friends with them? and you don't feel the same way? do you say something or just go along with it, awkward and unsure?    &nbsp;  also don't people know that when your all like "oh, i just LOVE my BEST friend!!" it makes your "close" friends very, very, sad?     &nbsp;  just a thought, if you have one, make a comment!

      weordp  hahahahhahah  i mean vavavav  ok  now for a real post  :::  vavava  i am still laughing  ok i'm writing this WHILE i talk to lindsey which should prove interesting  because i always forget what i'm saying  vava  weordp  today was most ex-CELL-ent  i cleaned   but it wasn't one of those days where you clean and its awful and no matter what you do it stil looks like caca  vavavavaav  anyway i just thought of mr.mac when that person wrote "poop" on the overhead in spanish and he was like "oooh! ca-ca!"  vavavavavav  ok so today i wanted to clean and i got to do laundry  and every peice of clothing in our house is clean  except for what we art wearing  la la laaaa  op er raaaa  ok picture::     my love   HMMM HMMM HMMM  hey don't you HATE when people make those retarded pictures out of like symbols and stars and it's like this:  ***** ****** ******* ******** ******* ****** ***** **** ***  I DO   I HATE IT  ok that was random     Associated Press WIMBLEDON, England -- Andy Roddick was upset about losing the Wimbledon final to Roger Federer, partly because it meant missing out on attending the champion's dinner with Maria Sharapova.   Roddick said he wanted to see what Sharapova wore at the gala.   "Will it be short? Is it going to be long? Disappointed I won't get to see that," Roddick said. "I might just sneak in and crash the party. I'll bring the beer, man. Let's go."   After her victory over Serena Williams in the women's final Saturday, the 6-foot Sharapova said one of the most exciting rewards was the champion's ball.   She got that slightly wrong. After the last ball in 1977, formalities were revamped and the function became the champion's dinner.   At the ball, the women's and men's champions danced together as part of the official program. Federer wasn't expecting to re-institute the ritual.   "You should know there's no more dancing," he said.   Olympic ideals Now that he's got three Grand Slam titles, Roger Federer will focus on winning an Olympic gold medal for Switzerland.   "It's been a dream of mine to represent my country, to win a medal there once," Federer said. "I came so close four years ago. I'm really going over there to maybe do one step better."   Federer lost a bronze-medal match to Frenchman Arnaud Di Pasquale at the Sydney Olympics.   Center stage Andy Roddick's coach, Brad Gilbert, was upset that the U.S. Open champion played only one match on Centre Court before his final against Roger Federer.   But Roddick looked right at home at the start of his first Wimbledon final, hitting 18 winners in the first set. Things went downhill from there.   "It was nice to get out there," Roddick said. "It was great. There's no place like it. That's the most prestigious court that I'll ever have a chance to play on, or that anyone will have a chance to play on."   Connors raising the roof Jimmy Connors, who won Wimbledon in 1974 and 1982, dislikes the idea of a roof over Centre Court. Organizers plan to build a retractable roof for the 2009 tournament.   "For me, there's more to winning Wimbledon than just actually playing tennis," Connors said in a newspaper interview. "Dealing with the elements, the rain delays and all the general waiting around is all part and parcel of these championships and winning here."   The 2004 tournament was plagued by rain, with two full days washed out and showers causing interruptions or early finishes on all but three days.   Federer running herd After Roger Federer won Wimbledon last year, Gstaad tournament officials honored him as the first Swiss man to win a Grand Slam event and gave him a cow named Juliette, and she has since had a calf.   Federer is fine with two cows, which is good because officials from the Swiss Open told Reuters on Monday that they will not repeat the gesture this year.    Which won't hurt the Wimbledon champion's feelings. "I'm fine with two for the moment," said Federer.  hmmm i am disappointed in roddick  slightly  ok so odd 13 this is for you:      quote:Fall is my favorite season in Los Angeles, watching the birds change color and fall from the trees.

      i was rooting for andy roddick but...he lost  i got up at 6 to watch him  ok, him and brad gilberts WHOLE plan was for andy to play up at the net because that's what federer usually does  AND SO  andy did that and WON the first set  then he stopped doing that and he started LOOOSING  i was like screaming at the t.v.  "GO TO THE STINKING NET!!!"  so he lost.  then i went to church   it was just me and lindsey  but that was really fun.  and then BEN sang this song  oh my gosh i haven't laughed that hard in a long time  it was so funny  he was like forgetting things and then he would sing really fast so he could sing it all again.  yes then i came home and ate salmon and took a 4 hour nap     whoa  arrrticle (its a little old but it is about maria and how she is NOT anna     By Greg Garber ESPN.com   WIMBLEDON, England -- At the end, Maria Sharapova was a hard, hard woman, lashing forehands and pumping fists. And through it all, she wore a steely, narrow-eyed look of -- what was it? Concentration? Determination? Contempt?   But in the dozen steps it took her to reach the net, Sharapova was transformed into a sweet 17-year-old in an elegant white dress. After shaking hands Monday afternoon with the defeated Amy Frazier, Sharapova stood in the middle of Centre Court and blew kisses to the crowd.   This is the delicate line -- between tennis champion and global marketing phenomenon -- upon which Maria Sharapova walks. So far, she's pulling it off.   Sharapova took out Frazier 6-4, 7-5 to reach her second consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal.   She will gladly talk about her tennis. But when the inevitable comparisons with Anna Kournikova surface, a cloud crosses her shiny pink face.   "People talk about what I wear and compare me to Anna, but I'm not the second Anna," Sharapova said. "I'm the first Maria Sharapova, nobody else."      Unlike Anna Kournikova, Maria Sharapova already has won three WTA titles.    As they say in tennis, Sharapova's got the goods.   She has a stout serve and a terrific ground strokes from the baseline. When she's on -- which has been most of 2004 -- she can bang sharply angled winners from seemingly awkward positions.   Sharapova has the physical assets to dominate the off-court game, too.   She is a Siberian-born blonde with a lithe 6-foot, 130-pound body that has already graced Gentleman's Quarterly, among other prestigious magazines. She has a contract with IMG Models, which also handles Heidi Klum and Tyra Banks. Her IMG management team has worked hard to position her as the next Kournikova. She never fails to drop by the ESPN studio after she wins her Grand Slam matches, whether she's invited or not.   Brace yourself, America, here comes Maria.   But here's the difference: This girl can play.   Sharapova's already won three WTA tournaments, including Birmingham a few weeks ago. Kournikova, whose tennis career seems to be behind her, did not win one. Kournikova reached the semifinals in her Wimbledon debut in 1997 as a 16-year-old.   The No. 13 seed, who made the fourth round here at the All England Club a year ago, has now done herself one better. Lindsay Davenport, who defeated Vera Zvonereva 6-4, 6-4 on Monday, is probably the only player who could prevent Sharapova from reaching the final and a possible match with Serena Williams.   The Kournikova comparisons, which have been occurring for years, are escalating. At Wimbledon, it has been happening at least once a day.   "Being a tennis babe doesn't do it for me," Sharapova said. "If that's what people are hoping for, then I'm afraid they're going to be disappointed. Of course I like to look good on court, but I'm out there to play tennis, not to look sexy."   She was born in Nyagan, Siberia, and came to America with her family in 1994. At the time, Sharapova was seven and the family's net worth was about $700. She trained at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Fla., and was driven to succeed.    "She's as nice as pie," Bollettieri says, "but be assured she's tough as nails and on a mission to be the No. 1 player in the world. She will not let anything stand in her way."   In Monday's match, Frazier held a big edge over Sharapova in experience (when Frazier played first Wimbledon in 1988, Sharapova was 1 year old). Frazier was playing in her 62nd Grand Slam event, while Sharapova was in her seventh.   Frazier was up a service break late in both sets and could not weather Sharapova's heavy weapons. Down 5-4 in the second, Sharapova hit a massive forehand pass and Frazier was broken when her half-hearted second serve hit the net a foot below the tape. Frazier's forehand into the net gave Sharapova the match. Then, and only then, did she smile.   "I just try to keep my concentration. I mean, I'm kind of an outgoing person & but I don't really want to let my focus go," Sharapova said. "You know, sometimes I want to smile, but then I think to myself, 'Maybe if you do smile, maybe your concentration will go off a little bit.'   "I don't want to let that happen."   She seems ready to take the next big step, which would be into the semifinals. She meets No. 11 seed Ai Sugiyama in Tuesday's quarterfinals.   "I really think it's the hard work," Sharapova said. "I don't think there's anything else to it. I don't think anything in my game's really missing at this point. It's just experience, it's getting stronger. I've been really focused this year. I know what it takes to achieve winning a Grand Slam and be No. 1 in the world. "It takes a lot of hard work, and that's what I'm prepared for."   When she lost to Paola Suarez in the quarterfinals of the French Open, she said she was "so happy" to be there. Here at Wimbledon, happy-to-be-here is no longer enough.   picture:::     quote:  mmm lemonade -me  The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.

      MARIA SHARAPOVA IS THE WOMENS WIMBLEDON CHAMPION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I AM SO EXCITED  haha and it happened this morning, i watched it alllllllll  it was so beautiful, she won it in straight sets  i heart maria forever  she is the first russian woman to win wimbledon  and tomorrow! head to head  dun dun dun andy roddick and roger federer!!!  tennis is so beautiful!!!  oh my gosh this happened like 17 hours ago and i am still like about to explode with excitment, i can't even type right   Picture(s):::::                 By Pam Shriver Special to ESPN.com   There's a brand-new superstar in women's tennis. Maria Sharapova has the game, the presence and the look.   What a final! Forget that Sharapova's only 17; that first set was flawless. We saw flashes of that ability in her quarterfinal with Ai Sugiyama and semifinal against Lindsay Davenport. But to come out that way against Serena Williams -- fighting from the first ball hit -- proved Sharapova's mindset. Then to win the first set 6-1, doing that to Serena on a grass court, is one of the most impressive finals I've seen.    Everything in Sharapova's game held up well. In the second set, Serena couldn't convert when faced with a couple of chances. She broke Sharapova only to lose on her own serve the next game. Serena couldn't hold onto any momentum. That signaled to Sharapova that this was her chance against Serena. She wasn't the same ruthless Serena she was during her Slam run. Instead, Serena felt the intimidation factor of Sharapova, which you never would have expected to happen this soon. Serena had a near perfect record in major finals with the only blemish her loss to Venus at the 2001 U.S. Open.    As for Sharapova, as she accepted the trophy she indicated that she already sees herself in other major finals and sees herself winning more titles. That's an attitude that has be groomed and is a result of the environment she was brought up in.   Sharapova is still restricted in the number of tournaments she can play because of the WTA's age rule. There's going to be some pressure on the WTA if Sharapova wants to play a full schedule as the Wimbledon winner. When Martina Hingis won at an even younger age, she was not under the constraints of the age restrictions in place now. Of course, she's also retired at age 23.   As for women's tennis, Sharapova's performance brought it back to a level it had lost in the past year. After no excitement at the Australian Open until the final and no matches of interest at the French Open, the semifinals and final at Wimbledon were intriguing.   Perhaps people will be more sympathetic and supportive of the the Williams sisters now that they've shown they are vulnerable to injury and defeat. Neither of them is holding one of the major titles anymore. Despite that, Serena was so gracious in the way she received Sharapova. Smiling genuinely at the joy of a first-time major winner. She allowed Sharapova to shine and indicated she was happy simply to have reached the final after such a long injury recovery.    There's still a big need in women's tennis to get everybody healthy. If somehow both Belgians could return at the U.S. Open to join the Williams sisters, Jennifer Capriati, Davenport (in her last appearance there) and the rising Russian brigade, it would revive the level of the sport.    Coming into this year, who would have guessed that the first three major winners would be Justine Henin-Hardenne, Anastasia Myskina and Maria Sharapova? With the top two seeds in Roger Federer and Andy Roddick reaching the men's final, for the first time in a while men's tennis is more predictable than women's tennis. Despite all the rain delays, this Wimbledon is turning out to be a cool event.     The Associated Press Updated: 5:07 p.m. ET July 03, 2004WIMBLEDON, England - Waiting to walk out on Centre Court with Serena Williams for the Wimbledon final, Maria Sharapova was fidgety. She bit her nails, tapped her foot, pressed a finger against her neck to feel her pulse.   After the match, Sharapova was giddy and giggly, fumbling with a cell phone while trying to call Mom, just like any 17-year-old at a suburban mall on Saturday afternoon.  Ah, but Maria Sharapova is not the average teen. Not by a longshot. And this was no ordinary afternoon.  Taking the next big step in a remarkably quick journey from Siberia to Florida to tennis’ grandest lawn, Sharapova was as confident and cagy as a veteran in her first Grand Slam final. She completely outclassed two-time defending champion Williams 6-1, 6-4 Saturday, becoming the third-youngest winner in Wimbledon’s 127 years.  “I’m absolutely speechless. I never, never in my life expected this to happen so fast,” Sharapova said. “It’s always been my dream to come here and to win. But it was never in my mind that I would do it this year.”  It was the most lopsided Wimbledon women’s final in a dozen years, and there were so many other reasons the result was stunning: Sharapova’s inexperience (just six previous majors), her out-of-nowhere status (at No. 13, she’s the tournament’s lowest-seeded female champion), and her opponent.  Williams was 6-1 in Slam finals and last lost this soundly in March 2000.  And after all those all-Williams and all-Belgian major finals, the last two Grand Slam tournaments were won by Russians. Anastasia Myskina gave the country its first such title at the French Open last month.  Now Williams, whose ranking slides to No. 14, and older sister Venus have yet another young superstar to deal with.  “I’m definitely going to triple my efforts, do everything I can to play better next time,” said Williams, 22, who had been playing her best tennis since missing eight months after left knee surgery last August. “Like I always say, everyone’s a big threat. You just can’t underestimate anyone.”  No one will dare underestimate Sharapova from now on, thanks to her wonderful backhand and serving, her court coverage and, most importantly, her toughness.  “At 17, to have that ability already, it’s pretty amazing,” said Andy Roddick, who won his rain-suspended semifinal and will play defending champion Roger Federer in the men’s final Sunday. “But it’s almost like she expects it. There’s something inside her that’s pretty impressive.”  Still, Sharapova’s unfamiliarity with Saturday’s stage seemed obvious at the start: She cut her warmup short to get permission to leave to go to the bathroom. Once play began, though, it was as clear as the blue sky above that she belonged.  Sharapova opened the match’s fourth game by using all of her 6-foot frame to reach for a backhand to keep the point going, then whipped a forehand winner. She ended that game by striking a backhand return right at the baseline, throwing Williams back on her heels to break for a 3-1 edge.  Sharapova, fighting a cold, broke again to make it 5-1 with a backhand return angled so well Williams didn’t even give chase. Now that’s a rare sight.  In the second set, it was more of the same: Sharapova digging in on key points, and Williams on the defensive. On one 19-stroke exchange, Williams fell while scrambling along the worn baseline. She stayed flat on her back while Sharapova deposited the ball in the open court. In the next game, with Williams at the net, Sharapova whacked a two-fisted backhand right at her. The ball glanced off Williams’ frame, caught her on the nose and trickled into the net.  After, Williams paid perhaps the ultimate compliment, saying: “She’s kind of like me. She doesn’t back off. She keeps giving it her all.”  That helped when Williams broke Sharapova’s serve for the only time to lead 4-2 in the second set. Many players would have folded.  “I was like, ’OK, Maria, get yourself together.’ But I pulled it out,” said Sharapova, who lost the first sets of her quarterfinal and semifinal before rallying.  “I’m just a very tough person when I go on the court.”  She broke right back with a backhand return that caught the baseline, then clenched a fist and glared across the net. That opened a four-game run to close the match, including another break with Williams serving at 4-4. It was a superb game, with both players grunting while trading powerful and precise shots, including Sharapova’s half-volley lob that curled over Williams like a rainbow.  When Williams dumped a forehand into the net to end the match, Sharapova dropped to her knees, bent over and covered her face with her hands. Williams went around the net for a gracious embrace. Sharapova then climbed into the stands to find her father, Yuri, for a hug and kisses.  Back on court for the trophy presentation, Sharapova tried to dial her mother, Yelena, to tell her the great news but couldn’t get through. Mom was on a plane from their home in Bradenton, Fla., to New York and found out while watching in-flight TV.  Imagine the conversation with the person in the next seat:  “Hey! My daughter just won Wimbledon!”  “Yeah, sure, lady.”  Sharapova’s whole story is hard to believe.  Martina Navratilova spotted her wielding a racket at a Moscow tennis exhibition as a kid and encouraged Yuri to get her serious coaching in the United States.  So he took his daughter to Florida when she was 7; her mother couldn’t get a visa and had to stay in Russia for two years. At 9, Sharapova moved into the dorms at Nick Bollettieri’s tennis academy with older girls and had a hard time fitting in.  Look at her now. The talk show circuit awaits, plus sponsorship deals galore. Sharapova already has a modeling deal. She’s dismissed comparisons with Anna Kournikova, and rightly so: Kournikova never won a title of any sort.  Sharapova now has four, including a major.  “I hope it doesn’t change the person who I am right now,” Sharapova said. “I already told a few people, ’If I change, then hit me in the head, please.”’       WOW   ok about me now..it is my blog  haha i went shopping for shorts and a swimsuit  gosh what is this stupid world coming to, they must think that every girl wants to be a prostitute or something, it makes me mad  so i found NOTHING except for a skirt  so NOW we are going to the mall on monday    *gags*

      are fun! we just went and got alll of our fireworks, sunday night will rock!  anyway today i got up at 11, and i watched tennis and squeeged windows for the first time in my life, it was fantastic  sort of  then i just cleaned  and made money  and...what else? nothing  EXCEPT TOMORROW IS WOMENS FINALS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 6 A.M.   OH. YEAH.  I AM SO EXCITED  i thought about having like a tennis stay up all night party (haha w/ myself) but we are going shopping in portland tomorrow and i don't want to be tired for that.  so i am getting up at 6 to watch it.  6-11  5 hours of greatness  because they have to finish up mens semi finals  which were delayed today due to raaaain  Picture:::  hmm espn.com just published an article stating that maria sharapova probably won't win       THEY ARE WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!   *breathe taylor*  mwahahah but msnbc.com says she will  such a controversy  ok i found a fantastic picture of a very dejected  JENNIFER EVIL CAPRIATI  and a superb article saying how she is wrong for blaming the media for her loss, and pointing out EVERYTHING ABOUT HER THAT MADE HER LOSE!!!!  mwahhahahahhahaha     and the article of truth:  Capriati's effort full of faults Resolve, confidence, shotmaking missing in ugly Wimbledon loss to Serena Williams  Jennifer Capriati's mindset was all wrong in her Wimbledon quarterfinal loss to Serena Williams, says Tracy Austin of NBCSports.com.    COMMENTARY  By Tracy Austin NBC Sports Updated: 11:34 p.m. ET June 30, 2004WIMBLEDON, England -   For the second Grand Slam in a row, Jennifer Capriati played listlessly in a huge match, falling in just 45 minutes in the Wimbledon quarterfinals to top-seeded Serena Williams. At times in her career, Jennifer has been the more mentally sound player than Serena, but it seemed in this match she didn’t believe she belonged on the court with her keenest rival.     What Jennifer was lacking  You have to give Williams all the credit in the world for her superior play in the 6-1, 6-1 win, but Jennifer collapsed under the pressure of the occasion.  This was her most one-sided loss to Serena, who has won 10 of 16 career meetings between the two.  The match was in stark contrast to their two meetings earlier this year, wins by Jennifer at the Italian Open and the French Open.  It was also the worst loss in Jennifer's 43 career Grand Slam matches.   Without question, two-time defending champion Serena is a superior player on grass, but Jennifer is a much better player than she showed in the disappointing loss.  The problem was she was so flat that she was unable to impose herself.  While Serena dominated with her incredible serve and return of serve, Jennifer could never get her guns out of her holster.  Both women looked very tight to begin the match, but once Serena felt that her serve would be with her all match and she could keep the points short, she played as well as she has since Wimbledon last year.  Jennifer was unable to get into her groove because she rarely was able to extend the points and even when she did, Serena played with a cooler head and was far more accurate.  In going against Serena on grass, Jennifer didn’t have the same belief that she did on clay at the French Open when she was confident she would be able to wear Serena out.   The media's not to blame Given how many of their previous matches have gone down to the wire, the one-sided result was simply stunning.  Serena had her head and heart in the match while Jennifer was a mere shadow of herself.  After the match, Jennifer took the media to task for making too much of the rivalry and putting too much pressure on her.  That’s ridiculous!  Jennifer has dealt with these build-ups before, most recently in Paris three weeks ago -- and that didn't keep her from beating Serena there.   It was obvious that at Wimbledon Jennifer didn’t feel as comfortable with her chances as she did at the French Open, or she would have responded much better.  Like Serena, she needs to avoid reading what the media is writing before important matches if it’s going to get into her head.   Her fitness found wanting  In order to win, Jennifer would have needed to serve huge and play inside the baseline to try to jump on Serena’s big kick second serves.  Instead, she was gasping all match.  Jennifer admitted after the match that’s she not in top shape.  That’s a big part of her problem.  On grass, you have to be able to get off the mark very quickly as it’s tougher to recover.  Jennifer needs to get her first step back or she’ll have similar problems on hard courts this summer.  Even though she is 28-years-old, I believe that she can contend for titles all summer long.  But she and her new trainer will have to focus on her nutrition and her foot speed.  Once she gets to balls, she’s fine, but if she’s straining to get her racket on shots, she’s in deep trouble.  Jennifer has always been a fighter and loves new challenges.  After being buried by Anastasia Myskina in the French Open semifinals and Serena here, she has a huge mountain to climb to get herself back in serious Grand Slam contention.

         17-year-old 'absolutely crazy' over win against Davenport  Sharapova to face Serena in finals Saturday Russia's Maria Sharapova sinks to her knees, as she defeats Lindsay Davenport at Wimbledon Thursday.  The Associated Press Updated: 9:44 p.m. ET July 01, 2004WIMBLEDON, England - On the most hallowed ground in tennis, Maria Sharapova sank to her knees, overwhelmed by what she had just achieved.   It’s a long way from Siberia to the Wimbledon final, and Sharapova completed the journey in 17 years.  With a zeal that delighted the Centre Court crowd, the precocious Russian rallied to beat 1999 champion Lindsay Davenport 2-6, 7-6 (5), 6-1 in the semifinals Thursday. Sharapova will play two-time defending champ Serena Willliams for the title Saturday.  “It’s absolutely crazy,” said tennis’ newest star, who was born in Siberia and has lived in Florida since age 6. “I never expected it to happen so early in my life. Getting to the final of Wimbledon, my favorite tournament, is just amazing.”  Only two women’s finalists were younger than Sharapova: Martina Hingis, who won the title in 1997 at 16, and Lottie Dod, the champion in 1887 at 15.  “Maria’s very good right now,” Davenport said. “And she’s 17. She’s going to get a lot better.”  Russia is an emerging force in women’s tennis, with six players ranked in the top 15, and Sharapova may be the best of the bunch.  Anastasia Myskina became the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam title when she beat compatriot Elena Dementieva in the French Open final last month. Sharapova is the first Russian woman to reach the Wimbledon final since Olga Morozova, who was beaten by Chris Evert for the 1974 title.  While she’s now the toast of Moscow, Sharapova’s celebrity is sure to extend far beyond her homeland. The 6-foot blonde is poised and personable, speaks fluent English and has had a modeling contract since 2002.  “She’s the best of the new lot,” 1977 Wimbledon champion Virginia Wade said. “She is truly exciting to watch.”  Her semifinal victory enlivened a tournament that had been largely devoid of drama on the women’s side.  Sharapova fell behind 2-1 in the second set before rain interrupted the match for 52 minutes. When play resumed, she lost the next game before commencing her comeback, winning 12 of 16 points to reverse the momentum.  What did she do during the rain delay to help turn things around?  “I was reading OK! magazine,” a celebrity publication based in London, she said. “It was quite boring.”  Not her match. Still on the verge of defeat in the second-set tiebreaker, she smacked six winners to pull it out, then walked to the chair waving her fist as the crowd roared.  The seesaw opening game of the final set lasted 18 points and ended when Sharapova whacked a ferocious return to break serve. From there she pulled away.  Sharapova reached match point with a spectacular backhand winner on the run that left her 10 feet beyond the corner of the court. Moments later the victory was hers, and she sank to the turf at the baseline in joy and disbelief.  “It’s a big moment,” Davenport said. “I think she’ll have some more of those in the future. I think this is like her definite breakthrough.”

      Capriati snaps after one-sided defeat Star criticizes media for overhyping match vs. Serena Updated: 1:00 p.m. ET July 01, 2004WIMBLEDON, England - A well of frustration and disappointment bubbled to the surface after Jennifer Capriati suffered her most one-sided loss to Serena Williams in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon on Wednesday.   The Floridian’s sunny smile was replaced by a dark and brooding countenance as she picked apart the remnants of her game following the 6-1 6-1 defeat.  The much-anticipated three-set tussle never materialized as Serena exacted revenge for Capriati’s French Open quarter-final win earlier this month in just 45 minutes on Centre Court.  The anticipation had clearly got to Capriati.  “I mean, when everyone’s talking about it so much, it’s very hard to just go out there and just completely focus on tennis,” she sighed. “You know, it’s like I can’t walk around with earplugs in my ears, you know.  “But what can you do? You’ve just got to do your best not to think about it or have that come into play because it does add more tension.  “It’s just very difficult to tune everything out. So, um, just that’s the way it goes sometimes. Not everything is always going to be the way you think it’s going to be.  “So maybe if you wouldn’t talk about it so much, it would have been a better match, I don’t know.  “The rivalry speaks for itself. You don’t have to even talk about it. It’s just there, you know, the people can see it for themselves.   “From the first press conference, from the first match, it’s already talking about the quarter-final match. You shouldn’t. Each match at a time.  “We can drop it now ... we can drop it.”  Capriati was entirely overwhelmed by her opponent and had no answers to Serena’s power and precision.  “She just played too good today ... she kept the level up,” the 28-year-old reflected.  “I would say today is probably one of the best that she’s ever played against me probably.  “I don’t think I really had much of a chance to get into the match and play. I was just feeling so much pressure from her coming off the baseline, the serve.  “Basically that’s what her game plan was -- to tee off on everything, and she was on ... so, really, I just couldn’t even get the rallies going.”

      i am talking w/ lindsey about missions trip last year  wow i am sad and happy all at the same time  that was such a fun time.....  anyway here's the article it's pretty good.   What's That Racket? How high-tech equipment is destroying tennis. By Nick Schulz Posted Thursday, July 1, 2004, at 2:27 PM PT      Roddick: Slow down there, sonny   This year's men's draw at Wimbledon is more a serving contest than a tennis tournament. Defending champion Roger Federer, who has won 106 of his last 107 service games at the All England Club, will likely face Andy Roddick and his 153 mph serve in Sunday's final. Expect a lot of short points.  Tennis players are better conditioned and far stronger than they were 20 or 30 years ago. But the athletes have changed far less than the racket technology. Compared to today's composite frames and Kevlar strings, rackets made of wood or the metal T2000 (popularized by Jimmy Connors) look like they should hang in a natural history museum. Modern rackets are significantly bigger and stronger than old models, yet weigh half as much. No wonder a former technical director of the International Tennis Federation has said that "we are approaching the limit on reaction time for the return of serve."  Men's tennis offers a cautionary tale for other sports. An absence of racket regulations has allowed the game to be transformed by technology. At this point, turning back the clock will be exceedingly difficult. Any fundamental changes to the game would lead to carping about the loss of tradition and resistance from players who've crafted a style of play for the game as it was presented to them.   The game's amped-up power and speed present a kind of Goldilocks challenge. If points are too long, spectators yawn; if they're too short, the sport loses its sweaty elegance. The problem with finding a balance between these extremes is that playing surface fundamentally changes tactics, style, and results. Fixing the game on grass could ruin it on clay, where big servers don't have nearly as big an advantage. So, how can you recalibrate men's tennis so it's not simply a test of who can hit the ball the hardest?   Change the balls: In the late 1990s, the International Tennis Federation introduced two new balls, one to speed up play on slow surfaces, another to slow play on fast surfaces. The "slow ball," which weighs the same as a standard ball but is 6 percent larger (extra surface creates more wind resistance, decreasing velocity), can offer up to 5 percent more time to read a serve. But players hated the new balls, fearing they would cause more injuries. Tournament directors sided with the players, and manufacturers stopped making the balls. That's probably a good thing. What happens when players start hitting the big ball as fast as a standard one? Soon, they'd be slugging those giant tennis balls that kids dangle out of the stands for autographs.  Raise the net: A higher net would keep servers from pounding down on the ball—less force means less speed. The problem is that every other shot would have to be altered as well. What's more, raising the net would launch a technological arms race. Michael Chang compensated for his short stature by using a longer tennis racket—it effectively made him taller. Raise the net, and players will push to lengthen their rackets.   Change the dimensions of the court: Tennis courts were drawn up when rackets were made of wood and strings were made of sheepskin. In professional golf, where players with modern equipment now hit the ball distances unforeseen years ago, courses have been altered to make them "play longer." But this approach wouldn't work for tennis. There are between 750,000 and 1 million courts around the world, all of which would have to be relined. Think of the poor groundskeepers. What's more, this is only a temporary fix—what happens when technology catches up to the new court sizes?  Regulate racket power: John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova have called for the game to go back to wooden rackets. This kind of Luddism is too drastic—players would revolt and the fans would fancy the lords of tennis a bunch of reactionaries.   Still, fixing the rackets seems like the only sensible solution. While the sport's governing bodies obsessively regulate court, net, and ball specifications, they've only just started paying attention to racket technology. In the early 1980s, the ITF started imposing size restrictions on racket heads, but 20 years later they've yet to limit what rackets can be made from.  Top-of-the-line rackets are now fashioned from titanium, carbon fibers, glass fibers, thermoplastic filaments like nylon, metal alloys, and epoxy resin. One popular racket, the Head Liquidmetal, was developed at Caltech and supposedly offers more power than titanium because of its amorphous (or "liquid") atomic structure. I'm no molecular physicist, but it seems like these tennis scientists could stumble onto the cure for cancer while developing next year's model.  The ITF claims that it's exploring some new guidelines to limit the power-generating capacity of rackets. But any such ideas are in the early stages, and there's definitely no concrete plan at this point. Banning a particular material would almost certainly be futile. Keeping a lid on racket tech is like trying to stop athletes from using performance enhancing drugs—by the time regulators find out about the newest innovation, something better will already be in the pipeline.  Rather than micromanage the legality of space-age materials, perhaps there should just be a speed limit. The ITF now has a ball-whacking machine at its Technical Centre that can wield rackets and hit serves in excess of 150 mph. This kind of legislation has worked for golf—in recent years the USGA banned "trampoline" driver faces that gave golfers an extra kick to those already monstrous drives. Manufacturers will surely complain that they'll be forced to spend on research and development without knowing whether their rackets will be legal. But this may be the only way to keep the latest technology in the game without turning rackets into lethal weapons.  It's likely that restricting rackets would even make the game more popular. Tennis-elbow-addled fans admired stars like Borg and McEnroe because they knew how tough it was to hit accurate, firm strokes with wooden rackets with tiny sweet spots. Taming the equipment will reign in firepower—and allow fans to marvel at the pros' artistry. When players like Federer and Roddick wield their mighty clubs, it's all too easy to forget they're incredibly skillful tennis players, not just ball-spewing cannons.

      i am waiting for womens semi's to come on, i HATE when tennis is on stupid NBC because they have like the worst scoreboard ever, the reception is fuzzy and the stupid matches don't even come on until the middle of the day. WHY can't they just stay on ESPN and start early and have some STINIKING QUALITY RECEPTION AND SCOREBOARDS.   ok that is my rant for the day.  YES!!!!!!!!! I JUST FOUND OUT THAT MARIA SHARAPOVA MADE IT TO THE FINALS!!!!!   OH. YEAH.     i am so happy     Associated Press WIMBLEDON, England -- Confirming her reputation as the biggest new star in the game, 17-year-old Maria Sharapova rallied from a set and 3-1 down Thursday to beat former champion Lindsay Davenport and advance to the Wimbledon final.   Playing in her first Grand Slam semifinal, Sharapova hit a stunning 46 winners -- 20 more than Davenport -- to overcome the 1999 champion 2-6, 7-6 (5), 6-1. She's the first Russian woman to reach the Wimbledon final since Olga Morozova in 1974.   In Saturday's final, Sharapova will meet the winner of the second semifinal between two-time defending champion Serena Williams and Amelie Mauresmo.   "It's unbelievable," Sharapova said. "I'm in the final. It's absolutely crazy. It's my favorite Grand Slam. I never in the world expected to do so well here, so early. I'm amazed."   The men's semifinals are set for Friday, with defending champion Roger Federer facing Sebastian Grosjean, and Andy Roddick playing 20-year-old Mario Ancic. All but Ancic were also in last year's semis.   When Sharapova ripped a forehand winner off a Davenport first serve to go up 4-1 in the third set, the match was all but over. She held at love in the next game and then broke a demoralized Davenport to end the contest. After hitting a running backhand winner to set up match point, Sharapova stroked a deep return and Davenport pushed a forehand long.   Sharapova looked up at the sky, covered her mouth in amazement and waved and blew kisses to all corners of the Centre Court stadium. She's the youngest Wimbledon finalist since Martina Hingis, who won the title in 1997 at 16.   The 28-year-old Davenport, winner of three Grand Slam titles, said it was probably her last match at Wimbledon. She's considering retiring next year.   "I'd be surprised if I was back," she said.   The 1 hour, 53-minute match featured tremendous shotmaking by Sharapova, who hit 20 forehand winners from the baseline. She also managed to neutralize Davenport's big serve and, despite eight double-faults, served six aces of her own.   "She totally deserved it," Davenport said. "I had control of the match and she took it from me. When I started to have a chance here or there, she always came up with great shots."   The match turned Sharapova's way after a 52-minute rain delay in the second set, with Davenport leading 2-1. After Davenport held for 3-1, Sharapova won 12 of the next 16 points to go up 4-3. She never trailed again.   "From the rain delay at 2-1, from then on, she definitely stepped up her game and from that point on was more in control of the match than I was in control of the tempo of the rallies," Davenport said.   Davenport twice came a point away from serving for the match in the second set, but couldn't break through. In the tiebreaker, Davenport saved two set points before Sharapova converted on the third, striking a clean backhand winner after a long rally.   Sharapova broke Davenport to open the third set in a game that went to six deuces and four break points. She dominated the rest of the way, while the 28-year-old Davenport had little left.   "I lost to someone who rose to the challenge," Davenport said. "I don't feel like I gave the match away at all."   The match was first suspended by rain at 15-all in the first game after less than a minute of play. When the match resumed 30 minutes later, Davenport broke quickly to win the first game. She broke again for a 5-2 lead and closed the set with a 106 mph service winner.   Despite the first-set score, Sharapova showed she would be a serious threat. While the 6-foot-2 Davenport tried to dictate the points from the baseline with her deep, flat strokes, the 6-0 Sharapova often managed to get to the ball and send it back just as hard. She had 11 winners in the set, including three unreturnable forehands in one game.   Davenport, who hasn't been in a Grand Slam final since losing to Venus Williams in the U.S. Open title match in 2000, was making her 11th appearance at Wimbledon. She defeated Steffi Graf in the 1999 final.   "I've had great memories out there," she said. "It's a little bittersweet to walk off a court and a venue where I've had some great victories and great moments in my career."  that is the article of the moment  la la nothing much else to say!  except for:  quote of  the  day!!  Be modest! It is the kind of pride least likely to offend. Jules Renard (1864 - 1910)

      i just got done watching the movie "Pearl Harbor"  what a good movie  it made me think a lot about being an american.  i mean i have heard SO many people talk about how they wish that they lived somewhere else, that they didn't like america, that america was "dumb"  real people  i mean hundreds of thousands of men and women were tortured, killed, maimed to protect our freedom, our country and the way we live our everyday lives, and we can't even like think about, or appreciate them once in a while. i mean sure on like memorial day, or Dec. 7th we do for a fleeting moment. but have you ever sat down and thought about what thousands of people have done for YOU? and you didn't even do anything for them.  that is the saddest and most encouraging thing to me.  as for "creepy josh"  i feel like throwing up about the whole thing.  it makes me feel sick.  the village was good, and i feel awful for you lindsey, i know how it feels.
