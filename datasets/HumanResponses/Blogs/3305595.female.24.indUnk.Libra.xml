      I just want to share with you some thoughts....   Facts: My mom died last holy Monday. She is 52 years of age, vibrant, life of  the party, with a loud laughter vibrating from wall to wall. Except for the last 6 months when she started dialysis and on the last month when she was bed ridden. She was a notorious diabetic, eating all the prohibited foods at her prime (balot, chicharon,coke, etc.). She reaped the burden in a few years time.   I am 23 years of age, only daughter, working for a quite huge  advertising agency. My mom and dad are separated since I was at grade 4. I see my dad often but he never went to the wake, nor at anytime my mom was in the hospital. I was adopted from my aunt (my dad's elder sister) and that made me feel out of place to my mom's clan. I never felt family.  I was never close to my mom. We fought most of the times when she was  still at her prime. We had opposite views in life, values, and attitude. I claimed to be a daddy's girl to all of my and her friends. We never talk about anything about life. We only talk when we are fighting. Usually about her and dad. I hated it when I am caught in the middle. But I strived to study hard for myself, and not for anybody else. I had my fleeting and permanent friends to cover the pain in my heart to survive. I didn't like her. she was the cause of my daddy's  leaving home. I kept telling to my friends, I'll never be like her. That was until such time when one critical hospital confinement, the doctor spoke to me and said "there's no hope."  Revelation: It has been a weeklong stressful wake and contemplation for me. My  tita, her elder sister, came home from all the way from Australia. There were a lot of tears, and truths that poured out. "Mamatay na ang sampung ama, 'wag lang ang isang mabuting ina," they  kept telling me. My tita told me mommy was crying to her all the time. She neverloved anybody in her life, more than she loved me. And whenever I close my door to her, is a dagger stabbed in her heart. Because daddy is impotent, they asked my aunt (who is my biological mom) to conceive me. I was never an accident, a dust in the wind. I was actually a gift, which they had prayed from God for so long. I never felt that until that time. All of her friends and acquaintance, who once in their lives was touched by my mom, came. They cried, most of them. They had the same line, "napakabuti niya,napakaswerte mo bilang anak niya." Even our constructor spoke in front of everyone testifying to my mom's kindness, "kahit anung oras kaming mga tauhan dumating sa bahay nila, pinapakain niya kami."  Insights: I couldn't paint into words how it feels. It will be turbulent clouds  in sunset with a crescent moon slightly showing. I am glad she is resting. Resting from all the physical torture she is tormented with. And the rest, is pure mourn and grave for the person more beautiful than diamond who kept knocking at my door.It's dust, which is left of me, I shall plant, and engrave in my spirit.This is the first time I wrote or spoke about mommy. The scent of the flowers in her grave may fade away, but her joyous spirit and love shall always linger in me, and in all the people who knows her. I never want to put her life into waste.  Message: I've learned my lesson. Learn the lesson from me. Hug your mom today  and for the rest of her life.Happy Mommy's Day to all mothers.

      Boredome. You wouldn't know how you'd acquire it nor how to beat it. It just comes every now and then. You wouldn't be able to resist the uneasy feeling of wanting to do something you just can't. You'd probably turn on the television, play with the remote control as if toying with a video game. You switch the channel every 2 seconds and find yourself just turning it off. Scan on some pile of magazines and books or even the newspaper you don't have a bit of interest, you'll end up just lying on the old sofa. You try to listen to the radio but your head aches even more because of stupid jocks and pathetic listeners greeting their friends on air. Then again, you're on your sofa, thinking on what to think. You'd hate the feeling. Staring to nothingness, letting yourself indulge into the burning time others claim as gold. You try to fight it as hard as you can but you are still there, helplessly being attacked by some unforseen force locking you up jus to lie there. It's not a matter of laziness to go out in the sun and do some sports, nor a matter of interest to force yourself to laugh at stupid noontime shows. NOthing could cure this, neither Einstein nor Newton. I know the feeling very well because I am in it right now. I am so damn bored, I want to scream, "when will you ever be home to call me?!"

      I was brushing my blue Adidas sneakers into the grass on the field that was wet from the morning's dew. I just felt like walking that morning because  felt a certain emptiness in me which I think I would find there. The cool breeze embraced my neck and shoulders although the sun which was already bright brought bits if sweat on my forehead. I just walked there smellinng the morning's air far from which I ritually have on the streets. I walked until when I had to stop because the heat is already burning my skin. I saw a mango tree, alone, in the middle fo the field. I sat on its overgrown roots and stared at the beautiful morning. The sky was so blue and the clouds are nowhere to be found. I listened to the enchanting music played by the birds rhyming with the rustling of the trees. Life is so beautiful you could almost laugh. I am eluded by this captivating scenery as if it was a painting, or a magic which is too good to be true. Unconsciously, hot tears started rolling down my cheecks. This magical illusion cannot fool me and make me forget the loneliness I feel within. I realized, I miss my dad so much.

        gusto kong umiyak  pero hindi ito sapat at wala akong dahilan para gawin ko 'yon.  gusto kong tulungan ang sarili ko  pero ako'y ligaw.  sa paligid ko'y mga leong unti-unting ngumangatngat sa aking puso.  ni walang makasaklolo sa akin.  gusto kong humiyaw sa sakit,  pero di bale nalang pagkat wala namang maririnig sa akin.  ayoko na.  tama na.  sawang-sawang-sawa na ako.  upod na ang daliri sa kasusulat.  sagad na ang luha sa kakalupasay.  bakit ako patuloy na nalulunod sa unos na humihigop sa akin? saklolo.  hindi ko kayang lokohin ang sarili ko.  kunyaring masaya, kunyaring maginhawa. saklolo. wala akong magawa.  kasalanan ko ba na ang kaligayahan ay nagpakalayu-layo sa akin?  gusto kong yapusin ang buhay ko, ngunit unti-unti itong nabubura.  anu nga ba ang dahilan para tumawa?  paano na nga ba ang tunog ng halakhak?  ang lampara'y aandap-andap na at ang kadilima'y papalapit ng muli.  kailangang itigil ang pagsusulat.  sana'y matapos na.  sana'y may ligaw na kaluluwang makaririnig sa aking himutok.  dahil kung wala,  ako'y magpapaalam na.
