       Well, I don't have too much to say. Me and Kris are going to hang out on Saturday so that should prove to be special. Also, my dad's cousin and her family are coming up to visit for about a week, so that should be cool. I haven't seen them in like 10 years. Me and Matt have been hanging out a lot, and me and Jen, since they live like right near me and I can bike or walk to their houses. Me and Matt went fishing yesterday and I caught a lot of seaweed. Oh, by the way Matt, I commented on your comment (finally) and I'm sorry it took so long. Well, nothing else to say, so byebye.

       Oh my god this is stupid. My CD's are still not here. It has been a week and a half now, and still priority mail can't manage to get my a little box from Ohio to here.  I have barely talked to Kris lately, because she is always doing something when I'm not working (which is rare, since I am working Jen's hours also, while she is in Missouri) and the stupid payphone at camp doesn't work half of the time. I really want to see her. In any case, we still have the 31st coming up. There is NO way we are going to miss that because it is something we won't see again in a very long time. I guess I don't have much else to say, this has been a very boring few days. I'm going to go call Kris. Bye-bye.

       The CD's that I ordered for my computer are STILL not here. That makes me very mad. I even paid extra to have them priority shipped. Not only that, I had $80 taken out of my last paycheck by the federal and state government for taxes, and they can't even bother to get some CD's from Ohio to here within a week. Ohio is only like 2 states away, and priority mail is supposed to come in like 2-3 days. But I'm sure they will come in tomorrow's mail, because I have to go to work at noon tomorrow, and therefore won't have any time to use them until 11pm when I get out...  I have to work at 4 today, so I really don't have that much time to do anything. Maybe I'll walk to the bank and deposit my paychecks that I have been collecting in my failure to make it to the bank. Oh yeah, I have to remember to deposit that check that is $80 SMALLER THANKS TO OUR LOVELY GOVERNMENT!  Sorry, I tend to get stuck on a topic when I am aggravated. I want to see Kris... I want to be held... :-( I feel lonely... Jen's on a plane on her way to Missouri, and I haven't seen Kris in like a week lol but it seems like forever... she was feeling really sick yesterday, I hope she's feeling better... Anyways, I guess I should probably go, I'm going to find something to do...  "Lately I've been wishing I had one desire, something that would make me never want another, something that would make it so that nothing matters, all would be clear again. But I guess I'll have to settle for a few brief moments, watch it all dissolve into a single second... you know that she's gone, 'cause she left you a song that you don't want to sing..."

       Well, I didn't talk to Kris all day today. It kinda sucks a bit, but that's okay. I have been sleeping real late the past few days and that makes me feel like crap for the whole day, but I finally figured out that my alarm clock was set to use the radio instead of the beeping thing, and the radio was tuned to silence so that's why it wasn't waking me up. So that will finally be fixed.  I am really being torn in two directions right now. I don't really know how to act. On one hand, I want Kris to know that I really love her and think she's the greatest person in the world, because it's true, and I think she needs to know how wonderful she is, and that she shouldn't be so down on herself. On the other hand, I don't want her to think I'm rushing things too much and end up scaring her out of wanting to be in a relationship, because I often move too quickly and suffocate people. I just want to do what is right, what will ensure she is comfortable. I really love her, I don't want to move too quickly or say the wrong thing and ruin this, but I also don't want her to think I'm not going to be really serious about a commitment if she is ready for that. I (once again) wish I could read minds. ARGH.  Too bad I can't just be happy that we are together, and take things as they come, and just say things as they come to me and let everything run naturally... I always worry too much, I always think I'm doing something wrong. I think I'll just do what feels right as time goes on, take it one day at a time. Except for the 31st, of course, I have to have at the very least SOME sort of plan, even a really rough one, because that night is going to be the most magical night we'll ever have I have a feeling. I don't want to plan too much, because then I get disappointed if it doesn't happen, but I do want to make sure that when I tell her what the day is it comes out right. :-/  PS- In case you guys are noticing posts appearing with dates on them from like days ago, yet they are just popping up, that is because I am posting them offline and they are just not getting published until the next time I connect to the internet.

       Well, today was supposed to be the day me and Kris hung out, but my dad couldn't get her because he had to take the dog to the vet, and she wasn't feeling good anyways. We have had very bad luck catching each other on the phone the last couple of days, though. We keep calling when the other is out. Then she called this morning when I was asleep and I called her back (at Kaitlin's house) after she had already left. THEN I called her house, but she was feeling sick and didn't want to talk.  Wow, I really don't have much to say, that's strange. It's not that I don't have a lot on my mind, because I always do, but I don't know where to start or how to put it into words. I know I REALLY want to see Kris. I need a hug right now, I just feel kind of... blah lol. Oh well. OH! I subscribed to voice messages here, so when I'm not online I can call on the telephone, and leave an audio post for you people to hear lol. I was experimenting and tried leaving one, but I don't know if it worked. It's okay, I didn't way anything important anyways lol.  Well, I wish people would comment, but other than that I haven't a thing to say. (By the way, if you click comment and it asks you to sign in or subscribe, scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Or post anonymously" and you won't have to sign in. I know that seems fairly obvious but Jen couldn't figure it out lol.)

       Hmmmm... it's been a really long day, despite the fact that I didn't really do much. I killed Slackware Linux on my computer, and installed Debian Linux, since I am getting the (sid) update CD's in the mail soon. Maybe I think that somebody will actually care, or maybe I am just talking about anything except what I really want to say.  I talked to Kris on the phone for a total of several hours yesterday, and her and her family are all in a giant fight thingy and it just overall sucked. By the way, she kinda broke up with Marc. She told me she was going to, then he never called because they were also in a fight so she just considers it over. But anyways, yesterday, I told her that I really mean to be there for her, and she can come to me for anything. So we were just talking about stuff, and she asked if she could tell me something without me being mad or thinking she was stupid, and I said yea, of course, and then she didn't want to tell me until right before we got off. Later on, I had to go so my mom could use the phone, and I just reiterated that if she ever needed anything, I was there for her, and to always remember that no matter how bad things got, I was always thinking about her and I would always care. Then, just before we hung up, she said, "I love you, Bill." And obviously I said it back, and then we left. But I have a very hard time with the word love, and actually rarely use it. I have told only three girls that I loved them, including Kris, and also have never told anyone else that I loved anyone except those three, despite quite a few stupid meaningless crushes. However, I noticed telling her I loved her yesterday, I said it easier and felt more confident about it than I ever have before. I really don't I could have meant it any more than I did.  Anyways, today we talked a bit about stuff, and then I told her how I was thinking about us a lot, and how I was sorry I didn't wait for her like I said I would, and asked what she thought would happen with us in the future. She said she only knew what she thought should happen, and didn't know when it would. Later, she told me all I had to do was "say the words" (which of course I am horrible at), and said she didn't want to wait, but would if I needed her to. I called her back later, and told her I loved her and that since I couldn't think of a more creative way of saying it, I would just come out and do it, and asked her if she would go out with me. She said yes and then we were just quiet for a while, and then she had to go because she was going to go take a nap.  Yea, so I guess that's the whole story, at least the main parts of it, I obviously left out tons of crap, but this is the main framework lol. I might post other things as they come up or as I remember them or whatever. Maybe it's time I told my parents that me and Kris are going out. Or that me and Sarah broke up. Or that me and Kris went out the first time. Wow, they miss a lot lol.  "I now have nothing but your heartbeat in my head" ~Alkaline Trio

       This is a really great story by Robert Fulghum. It almost made me cry the first time I read it. It's just so true and so amazing. Anyways, here it is:  Most of what I really need to know about how to live, and what to do, and how to be, I learned in kindergarten. Wisdom was not at the top of the graduate school mountain but there in the sandbox at nursery school.  These are the things I learned: Share everything. Play fair. Don't hit people. Put things back where you found them. Clean up your own mess. Don't take things that aren't yours. Say you're sorry when you hurt someone. Wash your hands before you eat. Flush. Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you. Live a balanced life. Learn some and think some and draw and paint and sing and dance and play and work some every day.  Take a nap every afternoon. When you go out into the world, watch for traffic, hold hands, and stick together. Be aware of wonder. Remember the little seed in the plastic cup. The roots go down and the plant goes up and nobody really knows how or why, but we are all like that. Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the plastic cup -- they all die. So do we.  And then remember the book about Dick and Jane and the first word you learned, the biggest word of all: LOOK. Everything you need to know is in there somewhere. The Golden Rule and love and basic sanitation. Ecology and politics and sane living.  Think of what a better world it would be if we all -- the whole world -- had cookies and milk about 3 o'clock every afternoon and then lay down with our blankets for a nap. Or if we had a basic policy in our nation and other nations to always put things back where we found them and cleaned up our own messes. And it is still true, no matter how old you are, when you go out into the world it is best to hold hands and stick together.

       Hmmm... Too bad Kris can't get online to read this... maybe that's good, actually; I don't think I want her to know how much this is tearing me apart. I can't believe how badly I ruined what could have been a wonderful relationship, and broke a promise at the same time. See, a while ago I promised her I would wait for her, no matter how long it took. It kills me to know that if I kept that promise one more week we would probably be together right now. Oh, hey, here's a poem I wrote:  maybe i'm just sick of being everything to nobody and nothing to everybody and maybe i'm just tired of being the last to know the last to smile and the first to cry  maybe this life of passing up everything i dreamt of with one simple mistake is getting old and maybe this life of having to let go while others lie to themselves is getting boring  i'm sorry but i can no longer believe in miracles and i can no longer depend on fate i can only look forward to bad luck and loss  i know everything good is preceded by struggle and nothing worthwhile is easy but what if that miracle never comes? the struggle seems somewhat pointless  this is all i have and i'll always be sorry it wasn't enough  Yeah, too bad it sucks. Well, I'll just keep repeating the same thing in my head that I have been for several days: "Don't let Kris get hurt". She really doesn't deserve it. Maybe I do.

       First of all, I have to say this: George Bush, happy 58th birthday and you suck a whole lot  Today was great with Kris, I haven't seen her since like the late 1800's, and I really missed her. I hope that we can hang out again but i don't think that's gonna happen because her boyfriend is a total garbage heap and I don't want to cause any more problems with them, I've done enough just by CALLING HER ooooo naughty me I might as well have just banged her... god I hate possessive people. Anyways, we hung out for a while and then Kaitlin showed up and it kinda sucked lol because she brought cigarrettes and that was suck but in any case, it was fun, and I ended up making a promise that I know will be quite hard to keep, but I already broke one promise to Kris, the promise that I would wait for her, and I'm not going to do it again. Then we were out on the lake in a boat and my dad came and screamed at me from the dock. But oh well. God I'm so tired of being alone, but at the same time I want to wait for Kris, in case Marc hurts her, physically or emotionally of course, because I'm really scared that he is going to, and she needs someone who will be there for her and love her unconditionally, which I am willing to do, and I am not going to miss another opportunity by making a stupid desicion to become involved in a relationship that's not going to last. She means the world to me, and I really think she is going to need someone to reassure her and tell her how wonderful she really is, and that everything will be ok. She really needs to realize how great of a person she is, and how much more she deserves, how much better she deserves to be treated. At any rate, I hope she is happy. I know maybe she will stay with Marc, maybe he'll turn out to be less of a jerk than he has been so far, or maybe they will break up and she just won't want to be with me, but I want her to be happy, she's been through so much and really should be happy. There's my Christmas wish, guys, bring Kris happiness.  And just so everybody knows: as mean as it sounds, my brief relationship with Sarah is the one thing about my life I would change, the one thing I regret. Only because doing that prevented Kris from telling me how she felt, and prevented us from attempting the relationship I always thought we could have. Anyways, this is sounding too emotional, but that's usual because it's late and I always get that way at night, I just don't want to say too much and sound like I'm trying to rush things or trying to ask for a lifetime commitment or whatever; I just want a second chance. Well, I talk too much so I'm going to go. But first I'll leave lyrics.  "So it's safe to say that we've been here before; Heart torn out, down for the count and still come back for more. This lesson is learned too well. Though, only unlearned by the time your wounds have healed. Have you had enough? I guess not because your lips are stuck to his. It's Time to say enough is enough, you would be so better off. You love him but tough because it's not coming back from him. You can't win. Stop expecting change, he's just a lost cause that you're waiting on. Take a look around, you could have anyone. So leave undeserving him. It only hurts at first. But then you will find someone to give you everything you want. Try not to go running back to him. So it goes unsaid that we've been here before. Lonely nights and endless fights and sleeping on the floor. And he's sorry, so the story goes. It's read and replayed and ends the same way." ~The Starting Line

       Well, this my first real post on what will become my most personal online journal yet. Be prepared, I will not be afraid to offend anyone with my thoughts, I will only give my 100% honest opinion, but hopefully most of you are already used to that and won't be bothered by it.  I have something to start out with, and that is of course a girl. Sarah and me are broken up, things just kinda... I don't know, but I really don't think it was as right as I was convincing myself it was. Maybe I just needed someone to hold onto, and the first opportunity that came along I took. Not that I had no feelings for her, but maybe I just misread those feelings and didn't think things over as hard and long as I should have.  Now, onto more recent things: another girl (lol). Since she isn't allowed online for some reason, I can say whatever I need to and not have to worry about her reading it, at least for now, at least until I can talk to her in person. Well, this girl has been on my mind constantly for just about forever, including when I was going out with Sarah (which is very hard to admit, but it's true), and for quite a while before that, too. Going back to school after that weekend with Sarah was torture, because I saw this girl and was just thinking, "god, what am i doing? im giving up an opportunity for everything i've ever wanted for someone i just met..." Well, anyways, I'm sure anyone reading this knows who it is, but it's Kris. She apparently has a boyfriend now *tear* but that's okay if that's going to make her happy. I really do miss her though, even on just a friend level, because she is so different than anyone else I have ever met, and the love I have for her is so different from anything else I have ever felt. We are going to hang out on Tuesday as long as everything goes okay, even though I don't know exactly what we are going to do, but that's okay because apparently she has something to talk to me about, and I have quite a bit to talk to her about, so the location probably won't matter that much. I really REALLY regret everything that I did with Sarah because of that though, because it seems she really wanted to be with me and I let that pass by to be involved in a relationship that didn't amount to much of anything, despite multiple promises of such... I always do that, though; if there is no hope, I will hang on the fantasy of a possibility, and if I do have a chance at something, I move on and don't pursue it, because I don't think I have that opportunity. Well, I know everything will work out fine, one way or the other, I just wish I could slow down the way I'm living life a little, everything is going so fast. I know it sounds really horrible, but Kris seems a little unhappy with her current boyfriend, so maybe that won't work out and maybe I didn't lose an opportunity for quite possibly the greatest thing that could ever happen to me... I mean, if she is happy with this guy, I REALLY don't want them to break up, I'm just saying, maybe if she ISN'T happy, then I might get another chance at what I've been dreaming of since not long after I met her, as long as I'm not stupid and blow it like I always seem to do. I just want so badly to be in her arms, to comfort her every anxiety, and get the same back, because that would be all it would take to do so; a simple hug from her just makes everything perfect again... well, I guess at the moment I just have to take things as they come, because I can't tell the future and I can't rush things, not that I necessarily want to do either. All I want is a second chance, even if I really don't deserve it, because I really think we could be happy together, and I really think I could make her happy.  Well, as good as it feels to get so much off of my chest, I really must go. I know I got REALLY personal here, but that is what a journal is for, and I have nothing to hide, and I really couldn't care less what people think of me, with the exception of a few, and none of them will think any less of me just because I am stating me thoughts. Besides, I think it's bound to get even worse, so I shouldn't start apologizing now. I'll post if anything exciting happens pertaining anything I have talked about way up there in that giant pile of words, and probably 15 times in between just to say how I'm feeling, because I tend to do that. Well, byebye, I'm tired of typing and I must go.
