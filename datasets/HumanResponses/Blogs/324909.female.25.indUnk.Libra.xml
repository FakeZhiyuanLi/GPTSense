      so i'm talking to my friend online tonight and realize that our 10 year reunion is coming up. man i feel old. i feel old and unaccomplished. so many of the ppl i graduated with have become such awesome people, shirin, working in the UN, out in the trenches of afghanistan, claire, in law school, jess and angie, off with their awesome careers and high falutin life styles...  and then........ i realize i don't know very many people from high school. i really haven't kept in touch with people, nor really care to. i know it sounds whack, but in my own way, i've moved on from high school when i graduated.   but in a way, it makes me sad because i don't know what everyone has been up to and i don't keep in touch with all these people that everyone else does. its nice that i see jessica and angie, and talk to claire and nestor online every once in awhile, but that is the extent of my knowledge of ppl from high school.   and the sheer superficiality of the process seems so stupid. in 3 years we're all gonna be boozin it up, pasting on our fake smiles and cheerful facades and politely inquire about our lives as we boast ourselves up to be as fabulous as we can conceive.   what the fuck is the point of that?   i mean, the next day, all we're gonna be left with are fake promises of keeping in touch and a bad hangover.   the gist of what i'm tryin to say is that i haven't accomplished shit, and if and when i go to that thing, i'll probably be right up there with all the shallow shit and make myself look GREAT. why? because i'm a bundle of contradictions and god damned insecure.

      i'm getting really cynical and jaded. tonight colleen's friend committed suicide and her and her friends were all bawling in her room and i politely closed the door and did my own work. i don't mean to seem cold or anything, but i mean, i'm busy for one thing-- way too much shit to deal with without having to worry about roommate drama, and also, i didn't know the dude, so it really doesn't affect me either way. and that sounds so bad, because i really do care about colleen and hope that she's ok, but i'm left with the existential questions lately, and it all seems so damned pointless.  like did she and her friends really know about this guy they're all bawling about? I mean it all seems so superficial and stupid.  because in a way, if they were really his friend, he probably would have felt less alone and less compelled to do something like this.  okay, that's cold, but in a way, its true. Colleen said that she knew he was whack, that he had some problems and had contemplated suicide before. i know she must feel horrible about it, and in no way am i blaming her, but if she and her friends knew that he had issues, then why the fuck didn't they do anything about it before it got to this point? the last time they saw him was months ago, and now, they're weeping over his death.  but i mean, how well did they really know him? and now, they all went up to dana point to drink and talk about him. to me, it sounds like a shallow excuse to party.  i know i'm taking this way too far and being over analytic about it, but lately i'm just so tired of the drama and people making a big deal about things that they don't need to. i mean, this guy killed himself, either you were a good, close enough friend where your life is really affected by it, or you were just an acquaintance and you just go on with your life. i know it sounds cold and to an extent black and white, but in some sense, its so true.  i hate that i'm becoming like this, but it seems that the older i get, the more easier things seem to me, i mean not easier in the conventional sense, but easier in terms of dealing with people.... dealing with life.

      do you ever wonder if you're doing things just for the sake of doing it or if you're truly embodying what it is that you're doing? sometimes i feel like i'm just going through the motions.  i know its awful, but i feel like i'm this shallow and superficial being that is just doing shit just so i can say that i did it. like grad school. i want my phd, that's why i'm in it, not because i necessarily care so much about the world or anything like that, but because i want to be a college professor and have the autonomy to do research in the things that i'm interested in.  this guy matthew, i found out, hates me because he thinks my work is bs and because i come from a "privileged background," according to a few of my friends. I know i shouldn't let this bother me, because what does he know about me? But to be honest, in a way, i'm deeply affected because part of me believes this. i feel like all i've done is gone through the motions and haven't found my 'research niche,' and it shows in my work. and i'm too damned apathetic to care enough to go do something about it. i mean i changed my topic, but i took the cop out route and am doing something really easy.  i just feel really frustrated and don't give a shit lately.  i feel unmotivated and lackadasical.... its as if i can just walk away and never look back.

      I love my life sometimes. i really do. i know it sounds stupid and cheezy, but sometimes things always work out for me. It sucks when I lose sight of how fortunate I am and how great things are for me at times. Some fabulous things in my life currently: -Saturday night, my sister and I finally made amends. I got her an awesome birthday gift and a sweet card and I think we're okay now. It feels so good to be back to 'normal.' not that normal was ever about tiramisus and puppy dogs, but its nice to have OUR sense of normalcy because in my own weird way i do love my sister. And it was nice thinking about planning a baby shower in a few months.  -Saturday night, I got to see my girlfriends and realized how lucky I am to have such a diverse crowd of friends that are interesting and crazy, but also serious about life and have some depth. -Last night, I actually started making progress on my 2nd yr paper, and I realized how lucky I am to be doing something I feel so passionate about and care about. I love writing, I love reading, I love learning, and I'm fortunate enough to be in a profession where I get to do all of those things.  -This afternoon, I tried to quit my job and my boss was cool enough to cut back my hours so that he could keep me. It was a great compromise because I didn't want to completely quit in the first place-- just reduce the amount of sress that it added to my life.  -For the first time in my life, I made a syllabus. A real life syllabus. I know it sounds stupid and cheezy, but it was one of the coolest feelings in the world. It just felt like I have made some concrete progress towards my career and I really liked the way it felt.  -Tonight, I called my mom to tell her my car was making some funny noises and my parents drove out 30 miles (that's a 60 mile trip round trip) to trade cars with me so that they could fix it for me. I have to be the luckiest daughter that I know.  -And most importantly, I'm completely enamored with my boyfriend.... that sounds stupid right, but how many people can actually say that they're completely in love with the person they're with and entirely sure that they want to be with them forever? not many i bet.  i guess i'm writing all the great things about in my life because often times i lose sight of the good and freak out about the minute details. i know things are gonna work out for me, one way or another, but sometimes i stress out about the small things and it affects every facet of my life. i don't want to be like that, i hate that side of me. i guess i just want to maintain this sense of tranquility i'm feeling tonight. don't get me wrong, i'm pretty stressed about my paper and i'm lagging on reading an article, but in a way, there's a sense of confidence that everything's gonna be ok and life will work itself out.

      what is it about alcohol that makes us do stupid fucked up things? i went out with the cohort last night for catherine's birthday. it was fun, i needed a night out, the week was bogging me down and i needed a good night out. but whenever you get a bunch of drunk grad students, stupid shit happens i guess.  i've been feeling really isolated from the cohort because i feel like everyone has established their 'cliques' and i'm really just a floater. i'm friendly with everyone, but i don't really have a 'core' group outside of the people in my cohort. i guess i just feel like there's a lot of intra-cohort closeness, but i'm just close to jill, christin, wendy and tara. but everyone has ppl they're close to based on their research interests and all that. the sad thing is that i don't really have a core interest that is supported at this school so its hard for me to find my niche. and the few ppl that do study race and ethnicity are never around cuz they're older.  so i'm probably gonna switch interests to immigration or something, because it really does interest me, and there's much more support for it on this campus.  so anyway. i've been feeling isolated and on top of that really emotional. i think its because my body is getting used to the hormone change, i'm back on the pill and i can totally feel the difference. i have been having cramps all month and feel like i'm on this emotional roller coaster. in some ways its nice, because when i feel good, i feel REALLY good. like when i went to see jae in DC and we were hugging in the hotel room, i was overcome by such an intense feeling of being in love that i teared up. that was nice.... i really love feeling that happy and vulnerable sometimes. but in some ways being this emotional sucks-- because i feel hyper-sensitive, frustrated and depressed at times. hopefully when my body normalizes and stablizes the hormone adjustment i'll be back to my chipper old self. joy. but going back to the stupid things alcohol makes you do. i felt like shit this morning. i woke up completely disoriented and physically drained. i wasn't sure where i was or how i got there. and then it all hit me-- the memories of what happened and i had this feeling of complete dismay and regret. ugh. and then i talk to jae and i'm reminded more of some of the stupid things that happened.  1. i smoked a few cigarettes. i hate smoking. i hate the way it tastes, smells and feels on your throat. but being drunk will do that to you i guess-- make stupid decisions. 2. i kissed christin. it wasn't a full on make out session or anything. but we pecked each other on the lips. the worst part is that jill drunk dialed jae and told him that christin and i made out. that must make him feel shitty. 3. i told a bunch of people that jae and i had web-sex and i know that he's really uncomfortable about that.   the irony is that i went out to feel closer to some people, but i still feel pretty isolated. it was nice to see my friends and have a few drinks with them and all that, but i think that because i have other close ties (i.e. jessica, colleen and of course jae) i'll never be that close to ppl in the cohort. and in some ways, i'm so much more happier because i have those other ties. i can't imagine not having them in my life.  so i guess i'm pretty happy... if only i could get this damned paper done, life would be copascetic. =)

      aaaaaaaaaaargh. just got in a tiff with jae, and i'm not sure why. sometimes i get so frustrated because i can't express myself and i feel like i'm forced to talk to him in the limited time constraints that we have. its like we're both so busy and we're across the country from each other, so we have to MAKE time to talk, things that should just be a normal part of our everyday lives. its harder when i get back from seeing him because as i slowly get used to having him completely all to myself emotionally, its suddenly ripped away from me, and it really makes it hard on our relationship. i hate how we can't just have normal interactions... like sometimes you just need someone and i feel so alone. i mean in the long haul, i'm sure it will make me stronger and all that bs, but in a way, i need to see him, to be reassured that he loves me. sometimes, i feel insecure and afraid that i can't completely trust him, and of course i want to, but in some ways, my insecurities get to the best (and worst) of me.

      another old post from about 4 months ago One of my roommates, said something profound about why I need not to be in a relationship with elmer. its funny, you don't think about how certain little things affects you so much. But she told me how i keep so much hidden from him, and how that affects me. and its so true. i told him a few days ago that we need not to date one another anymore, but its so hard to let go... so hard to start fresh after nine years of the bad, nine years of the good, everything that we've been through.

      Its so weird that its only been a few days since I've seen Jae, but I'm already missing him. Its hard not being able to talk to him all the time, like tonight I think he passed out from getting up so early after only 3 hours of sleeping last night. I want to let him get some sleep, so I'm refraining from calling him... Even if I were to call him, though, it would render somewhat pointless because it seems we talk alot about the same stuff everyday... "I miss you... I wanna be with you... I love you... I can't wait to be with you..." etc etc....  Is this that "phase" that all relationships goes through when things start falling into a rut? Its funny, it doesn't feel like a rut, because I feel so close to him and I'm SO in love, but in a sense, it feels like we're running out of things to talk about and it kind of scares me, because I don't ever want our relationship to get stale.  E has a new xanga posting about feeling alone... i feel so bad for him... i was hoping that he had found someone new, but i guess not... its hard to be so happy with someone i really care about having so much crap going on in his life-- most of which has to do with what i did to him. its kind of weird how easily i fell out of one relationship and into another, i can't imagine being with anyone but jae now, and it makes me sad to think of 1. how happy i am with him while E is miserable and 2. how E and my relationship wasn't that happy to begin with, which is how i fell out of it so easily.  i can't believe sometimes how much time i had devoted to him and how i essentially lived a lie of being so happy with E for so long. I mean of course i didn't 'lie' to him in the conventional sense, but in a way, i lied to myself about how happy i was. i should have just stayed apart from him in the beginning instead of continuously trying to make it work.  i know trying is a big part of relationships, but it makes me wonder at what point are you supposed to just throw in the towel and give up and when are you supposed to keep on trying?

      its harder than i thought it would be to be in a ldr.... in some ways its nice because we're both incredibly busy and really don't have time to see each other, but sometimes its so hard when u need someone to be there for you and you just crave the affection and intimacy.... lately J* has been on his surgery rotations and they've been working him to the bone. the call nights are especially rough beacuse i'm so used to calling him and talking about our days and stuff. in some ways, i feel insecure about a few things, but i know over all that i want to be with him and that he's the one.... but it scares be because our relationship reminds me of his and his exgfs.... they had a ldr (she was in cali and he was in the same place-- how crazy is that). and the coincidence is just so striking. and i wonder if he still thinks about her sometimes and misses her.... i know he says he doesn't, not in that way anyway, but i can't help but to recognize the parallel between our relationships and how he can't help but to be reminded of her.  also, i'm getting worried because the 'newness' of our relationship is slowly wearing off, i can tell that we are running out of things to talk about and i wonder if he is getting bored of me. of course it would be different if he were out here and we could interact daily and wouldn't have to talk on the phone or chat online to get our daily dose of each other, but its so hard to think of things to talk about, especially because we're both so busy and our lives aren't exactly that glamorous or exciting.....  anyway.......... just wanted to put a random post up as my first post, sooo i'll write more later.

      on a muggy summer day at Virginia Beach I stood waist deep in the warm Atlantic Ocean, about 30 feet away from my boyfriend. I knew he was there, and that was comforting. The weather was about 90 degrees and humid, but being in the water made the heat more bearable. Because the water was so warm and pleasant, the waves seemed less threatening than on the other end of the world. As i stood out looking into the clear blue-green horizon, i enjoyed the salty sea water and air and was comforted by jae's presence, though somewhere distant, still very near. The sky touched the ocean somewhere that seemed so near, but was so far. There was a sense of tranquility all around, in spite of the kids screaming and laughing, as the ocean drowned out most of the noise. The water rolled in, crashing into waves behind me. i let the tide carry me back, to where the waves hit the ocean, and let myself float about a bit. As I saw a wave approaching me, there was a sudden sense of urgency, and some trepidation. I anticipated the water crashing around me and for a few second, the world seemed to go slower, each microsecond becoming minutes. Then, the water crashed over my head, much colder than the rest of the ocean, much more saltier, much more stinging as the strong current hit my skin. In spite of my anticipation, the wave hitting me was far more stronger and harsher than I could have ever imagined. I stood there, trying to regain some composure, squeezing water out of my hair and moved back out into the ocean where I could feel just ripples and avoid the waves. The panic I felt while being capsized threw me into a world all alone. Jae visiting is a little like that trip to VA beach. While he's here, its wonderful, I love every little nuance about him, even the strange and annoying habits that nobody can ever really understand. I love waking up next to him, with the smell of each other infusing the air. I love falling alseep in his arms, touching his face, and body. I love starting our day together, because each day feels so fresh and new, and it feels like the whole world is up for our taking. I love the passion, the sweetness, the silliness, the crassness, and mostly, the sense of tranquility I feel with him. But when he visits, there's a small part of me that thinks about him leaving in a few days... its similar to the anticipation of being capsized by that wave. You know its coming, you see it coming and even feel it coming, but when it actually happens, its worse than you could have imagined. He then leaves and there's a sudden feeling of panic, oh my gosh, i'm all alone, what am i supposed to do? i'm scared. and after a few days, it passes, and you're left alone, in the middle of the ocean, remember how hard it was to be overturned by the ocean, but knowing that eventually, it will happen again. and before that happens, you enjoy the ocean as much as you can, taking in as much of it as possible.  today was hard especially because all day i knew i'd have to say goodbye to jae. i didn't want to wake up, i didn't want to face the day and i didn't want to leave his side. While having brunch with his family, i tried to be as jovial and social as possible, but at any given moment, i felt as if i could cry. there was heavy feeling of dread and meloncholy all day in my heart. i know it sounds so dramatic, but his brief visits are like a drug-high. sure, you feel great while its there, but coming down is a bitch. being left alone in an apartment, going back to the drudgery of reality is harsh.  I can't wait for the day when it doesn't have to be like this. i wish we could always be together and never have to say good bye for more than a few hours....

      Happy Thanksgiving! I had some crazy dreams last night. First I dreamt I was at school, getting some work done, but it didn't look like my school, it looked like a REAL school, one of those east coast schools you see on TV, with the old buildings, the wooden floors, much warmer than UCI... Yeah, so I dreamt I was in this room with my friend Christin and we were getting some work done on our laptops, and we went away briefly to get some coffee or something. and its so weird how you see other ppl's actions behind your back in your dreams, because even though i was away, i saw these 2 dudes stealing my laptop. So anyway, i come back and my laptop is missing and i'm freaking out because my thesis is on it and i don't have the recent back up files. so for some reason, i feel the need to see elmer and have him help me get my laptop back, because someone told me he was involved in the theft.  So i get on this tour bus (i know it sounds weird) and i'm travelling everywhere looking for him. I get to this swanky hotel and ask for a cab to go look for him even more. I run into his cousin Ronald, whom I've always had an affinity for, and he says that Elmer is getting married, and that he needs to find him as well.  So we're running through what looks like Rome, underground the vatican. As we're running, Ronald is telling me why Elmer is getting married, that us dating for 9 years impeded the inevitable. Basically, it was an arranged marriage by his parents with a close family friend. Elmer didn't want it, but he didn't want to disappoint his parents so he didn't say anything.  I got really frustrated and was telling ronald that it was the biggest issue in our relationship that he couldn't communicate and never told me what was wrong. We pass 2-3 weddings on the way, and each time i'm hoping its elmer's. I'm not sad that he's getting married, but i'm mad that he isn't telling his parents the truth.  and then i woke up.  crazy dream, huh? i don't know what it means, but the obvious. i'm scared about my laptop being destroyed cuz right now it has my life and blood in it (i backed up everything this morning).  Part of me still thinks of elmer as someone i can trust and rely on. and I'm still frustrated that he can't be up front about his emotions and open with his family.  I'm so thankful to be in a relationship where i can be totally open now, and he's totally open with me. it feels... refreshing.  *~*And now, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, 10 things i'm grateful for: 10. My roommates. Even though they're wacko and get on my nerves sometimes, i love them to death 9. being in an awesome grad program with some crazy smart people 8. Having such great friends that care and think of me 7. Being in good health. that sounds generic, but given my health, to feel healthy is a blessing 6. Losing a lot of wt. I know that sounds stupid and shallow too, but i've regained a lot of confidence since i've dropped the weight, and i feel better about myself, not just mentally, but physically, i feel stronger and lighter 5. Being able to appreciate the small things in life. that is so crucial to keeping my sanity 4. Having the ability to TA and teach at gateplus. Even though the pay is crap, it does allow me to have my apartment and be on my own. And i do like the work, and love my students. 3. My amazing family that will do so much for me, and vice versa; i love my family more than anything.  2. Having such a dang awesome boyfriend that is so hot and sweet to me.  1. The #1 thing I'd have to say is............ two words: Rabbit Pearl. =) (jk of course) HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!

      I'm lonely tonight. Colleen took off for her parents for Tgiving and Tyson and Jill are in Nebraska... Funny how when you're with the roomies you get uber annoyed and just want your space but the minute they're gone the apartment feels wholly empty. I cleaned today, the whole apartment, from top to bottom. IT was filthy. But now its nice and clean for jae's arrival. i can't wait to see him.

      Haven't wrote in awhile... I'm kind of having an off week. Just kind of feel down and out of it... not really motivated by much,  maybe because its getting close to crunch time and i'm regressing. I don't know what it is, but all I know is that I'm just not quite feeling like myself lately. Its nothing I can really verbalize or articulate, I just feel like this every once in awhile. Since I've gotten out of dating elmer, I don't feel like this as much, because it used to be a lot worse-- but still, every once in awhile i feel like this. these were the moments i dreaded and that took me to anti-depressants. i wish  sometimes that i can have that crutch to lean on because its not only the panic attacks that i wanted to avoid, its these week long depression phases i go through.  I found something of Jae's that I shouldn't have, and i know that has a lot to do with why i feel like this. sometimes when i know i've disappointed people, i really get sad and it brings me down a lot. i don't care a lot about what people think of me, but when its people that are close to me, its another story. when i was younger and even now when i disappoint my parents or my family, its always at the back of my mind and it really affects me. and in a way i feel like i disappointed jae and i feel really down about it. i wish i could just forget about it, but in a positive way, it shows how much i care about him and what he thinks of me. i guess also its related to me being afraid that he's going to end up resenting me if i keep disappointing him. i know he won't and i know he adores me, but i still have my insecurities.... i miss him and it makes it worse.  he's disappointed at me because i looked at thuy's shit and because i can't let this go, but in a way, how can i just let something go when its my insecurity? i looked at it out of curiosity and he's mad because i saw a lot of her private thoughts and in a sense, he doesnt like that. maybe in a sense he's afraid that her thoughts would taint my vision of him, but in truth, they didn't. i know he doesn't like that i looked at his stuff, and he wants to be the one to answer the questions i have and quell the insecurities i have, but these are my issues, and he really can't do much to solve them.  i feel like shit. its funny how even though he says he hates her, and yet in a sense he is still trying to protect her. he's so concerned about me checking her emails, looking at her stuff.  the irony is that with more time the insecurities go away, but when he reacts like this to the stupid quirky things that i do, it makes me feel more sad... more alone. i don't know i guess i hoped that he would be over her, and that he wouldn't care so much. but he's really perturbed by this. and i can see why, i'm "picking at his scabs," as he said, but that's not my intent, i would never want to hurt him. the fact of the matter is that he is still bothered by her. and to an extent, why shouldn't he be, i know elmer still cares, i know he must still be sad when he thinks of me. is really forgetting about the person truly a way to get over them though? i don't know anymore... i just want to sleep and sleep and sleep. jae thinks i'm immature because i don't want to talk about it, but to be quite frank, i'm not sure what there is to even talk about anymore. its not that i don't want to talk to him, but i just dont want to deal with anything anymore.

      something i just wrote for a class that gave me some elightenment for today:  	I found the pieces by Becker interesting and insightful—although that sounds generic, it really is not meant to be, because I was able to relate to much of what he and his colleagues said. Graduate school IS a frightening and isolated process that re-socializes one’s approach to writing. I too, have my neuroses when it comes to writing, I can only write on certain paper and with certain pens and in a certain environment. All of this is very closely related to Becker’s discussion on the neurotic behavior attached to writing—because we are in fear of being criticized. I think as an academic one is so attached to their work—it is the polar opposite of the corporate world where one is completely not attached to the product or service they provide—and with that attachment comes a great amount of trepidation when others read the finished product.

      I'm reading a book called  Sidewalk  by Mitchell Duneier, for Jen Lee's class, which is actually a really good for an academic book. It makes me long for the city. lately i feel as if there's been so much I've missed in my life. As if I could have gained so much from going to school on the east coast-- or anywhere other than Southern Cali. I guess I go through this a lot-- just knowing that I was deprived by being so sheltered in my life.  part of me wants to take a year off from school and go live in the city for awhile and experience all the things I've ever wanted to do, such as be fully independent, live in the city, go work odd jobs, support myself... get in the culture and feel of the city.  But realistically, i know that i need to finish my phd... because i don't ever want to live with regrets, and i know if i don't finish school, i'll probably regret it for the rest of my life. Living in the city can always happen-- i can always do it, i guess its just a matter of doing it while i'm still young enough to have the vitality and energy to enjoy it.  it sounds stupid to say that in a few years i'd be too old to do anything, but i feel like the next few years are pretty set out. also, i want to be with jae, so doing the whole 'living alone in the city' thing doesn't really fit into the picture.... not that its THAT important, but in a way, it would be nice to be able to have that experience.  i realize how much more and more i love jae... that sounds stupid and cheezy, but seeing him each time, i fall in love with him over and over and realize how lucky i am to have someone like that in my life.  last night something hilarious happened.... we were being all romantic and had candles lit, after a long and nice bubble bath, i gave him a massage. I was sitting on his butt and rubbing his back and shoulders down with some yummy smelling massage oil. Nice music was playing throughout the apartment and it was generally very sensual and sweet at the same time. But then, all of a sudden, "BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP" the annoying sound of the smoke alarm resonated throughout the room. I think it took a minute to register in both of our minds because we were so relaxed, because I said, "what was that?" and Jae responded with "I dunno..." then all of a sudden, it hit us that it was the smoke alarm.  He jumped up, me falling to the side and pulled the blanket up, and there it was, his down comforter burning away. We quickly put it out, opened the windows and spent the next 15 minutes sewing it up. it was pretty funny in retrospect because the chances of that happening seemed miniscule. lesson learned? don't put candles so damn close to the bed. the scary thing is, we were so oily from the massage oil that we probably would have burned to a crisp as well.  Anyhoo... time to go back to work, *groan* ciao.

      i wish that a certain someone in my life could understand these lyrics: ================================================ Yeah-yeah, oh, I've got it all but I feel so deprived, I go up, I come down and I'm emptier inside. Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing and why can't I let it go?  There's gotta be more to life, Than chasin down every temporary high to satisfy me. Coz the more that I'm tripping out, thinking there must be more to life, Well there's life, but I'm sure there's gotta be more than wanting more.  I've got the time and I'm wasting it slowly, Here in this moment, I'm half-way out the door. On to the next thing, I'm searching for something that's missing.  There's gotta be more to life, Than chasin down every temporary high to satisfy me. Coz the more that I'm tripping out, thinking there must be more to life, Well there's life, but I'm sure there's gotta be more.  I'm wanting, oh, I'm always waiting on something other than this, Why am I feelin like there's something I missed?  There's gotta be more to life, Than chasin down every temporary high to satisfy me. Coz the more that I'm tripping out, thinking there must be more to life, Well there's life, but I'm sure there's gotta be more to life, Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me. Coz the more that I'm tripping out, thinking there must be more to life, Well there's life, but I'm sure there's gotta be more to life.  More to, more to life, more to, more to life, there's gotta be more to life, More to, more to life, more to, more to life, there's gotta be more to life.

      the man and i got in a fight last night. it was awful. basically i found out from another person that he sent her a bday e-card and this just opened up a whole new bag of worms. his issue with me: -the fact that i have been keeping info abt thuy (the ex) and have been talking to ben (the psycho informant)  my issue with him: -why the HELL is he sending her a bday card when he clearly said that he didn't want anything to do with her...? -and why is he sending it 3 days early-- consequently when i will be visiting him during her actual birthday? seems like he wants to hide it from me.   ok i understand that its the 'adult' and 'civil' thing to do, but the issue is not that he sent the bday card, its the weird circumstances arolund it. I'm sure that if he TOLD me that he was going to do so, or even after the fact, i would have been fine with it. but i wonder if he was keeping it from me, i wonder if he sent it 3 days early to avoid me finding out about it and i wonder why he would want to even keep something that even HE considers so trivial.   its all stupid shit, i know, but in a way, this issue goes deeper than this one isolated incident, the problem with the 'ex-files' is that its not just about him sending her an ecard or anything stupid like that, its a whole conglomeration of other issues.   it doesn't help that i came out of a really bad relationship with N* who screwed me over and would say things like what jae is saying ("you're being paranoid").  Much better conveyed over IM: denstrr: well maybe he was just being civil...and he wanted to spare your feelings and avoid drama by not tellin u and sending it early SlappySong: well that's what i was doing with not telling him all the gory details. SlappySong: and he's mad at me for the same reason ...? denstrr: yea.. denstrr: u guys should talk about it tongiht denstrr: when you are both cooled down denstrr: and have a rule that u have to tell the truth, the whole truth...and no one can get mad denstrr: get it all out in the open SlappySong: we talked about it already denstrr: o what happened SlappySong: we worked through it. SlappySong: but i know i shouldn't be SlappySong: i'm mad because he's disappointed in me for the same reasons that i'm disappointed in him denstrr: if anything SlappySong: and its such a stupid issue that shouldn't have even been an issue SlappySong: you know?  so its over. i'm just left with some questions like why...? not so much why the card, but moreso why the not telling me about it and why so early. seems so trivial, but like in the case of lacey peterson, it comes down to the moved oil can and the single hair..... call me paranoid, but some things just don't make sense to me, and until they make perfect sense, they drive me crazy.

      12/29/03 Had some naughty fun in the call room and i got some work done. Went home around midnight, and couldn't sleep till 4am, because i was lonely. Forced myself to get up around 9am to clean the apartment and do some laundry before jae got home. Went to pick him up around noon, and we came home to have a quickie and fall asleep. Had dinner-- tuna wraps, watched tv for 3 hours, went to pick up some videos, went to work out. Fell asleep around 2ish. 12/30/03 Jae got up early to go to work, he took off around 6:40... went back to sleep. Woke up around 10. Got some work done till the boy got home around 2:30... we had a quickie and went to the mall for some coffee. Walked around for a bit, and had dinner at CPK. Came back home and have been working on/off on my paper.  I feel weird... kind of homesick. its the post-quarter-partum (post-quartum?) depression sinking in i think. feeling kinda down cuz i don't know what's gonna happen after grad school. I snapped at jae earlier at starbucks, but he was getting on my nerves because i was irritable and he kept asking me how to make espresso. I tried to explain it best i could, but i ended up feeling stupid. But i was irritable overall-- so i dunno. just feeling down and kind of homesick. it'll probably pass-- at least i hope it will.

      So here I am in freeezing VA. I've been here a few days now, and its been really fun. Aside from the nagging voice in my head that tells me I should be getting some work done, Jae and I have been having a blast.  12/28/2003 (Today) I'll archive it here so I can cut and copy for the website later This morning was painful. We got up only after a few hours of sleep and jae had to go to work. After dropping the boy off, I went back to the apartment to try and get some sleep-- it just wasn't happenin. it was too damn bright in the room and i felt lonely. So instead, i got up and started to clean. The closet was a mess-- I dumped everything on the floor and started ground-up. It felt like a mad-frenzied version of queer eye for the straight guy. OR should i say girlfriend's eye for the straight guy. After a few hours, i did the laundry and went to get some stuff for jae's lunch. I made some more of the same from yesterday-- the avocado, brie, apricot and french bread, but also made a craisin-walnut salad with an apricot-balsamic vinegarette dressing topped with tuna salad. it turned out yummy. Brought it here to the hospital, where jae and i ate in the call room and have been hanging out for a few hours now. (we did something unmentionable in the call room too haha)  We're both tired though, because we hardly got any sleep last night.   12/27/2003 We went "clubbing" last night, I say that with quotes because the scene in Richmond just doesn't cut it for an LA socialite like myself (haha, not really-- but its just a huge contrast). But it was a blast, we went to the Old Tobacco Company and had drinks and danced for a few hours after a really nice dinner of sushi at Osaka.  But this was only the end (and should i say beginning) of a great day/night. We got up uber-early and had bagels/espresso and ran some errands. After coming home, we had a light lunch-- which is Jae's new favorite dish-- consisting of brie cheese on hot crusty french bread along with some avocado or apricot spread and jasmine tea. yummy. After lunch, we hung around the apartment *hehe* and had a quick work out. When we went to the gym, jae took off his shirt while working on his shoulders and i couldn't help to stare. omg. i am a shallow shallow bi-yatch, but my bf is a hottie with a damn nice body... i yelled at him to leave his shirt off when he tried to put it back on... i think he found that entertaining.  After getting ready for a night out on the town, we had dinner at osaka and hit the old tobaccy company for some drinking/dancing. We had fun in spite of the very mixed crowd. Now when you hear "mixed crowd" in LA, you think along the lines of josh slocums or cine-space, right? When i say mixed crowd in VA, i mean MIXED CROWD. Admist the 80 year old white couple swing dancing to Jay-z's "bling bling" was the 50 year old vietnamese mom skankified, with her g-string and tattoo on her ass showing as she danced to "heaven" (dj yanou-- not eric clapton). The "scene" was pretty funny, to say the least. We got home around 1-- we had to leave when they started playing "red red wine" followed by "play that funky music, white boy--" where jae drew us a nice bubble bath. We talked for a long time and ended up staying up till 4am doing something vewy vewy naughty. ;)   12/26/2003 Xmas day was nice with the family, but the best part was getting to take off to see stinker!!! =) I had a 9:30 flight out of lgb to iad. couldn't sleep cuz i saw one of jae's old groupies, binh on the plane-- and the strangest part is that i recognized her after never meeting her nor seeing pictures, but only hearing stories about her-- that and i spied on her. how weird is that. but yeah, it was her.  So i step off the plane, dead tired and what do i see? This hottie boyfriend of mine who got all dressed up "bougey style" for me. Okay, that sounds weird, and i know i'm shallow, but who isn't? Jae is hot, no matter what, but when he does his hair  and gets dressed up, i get REALLY excited, because its a rarity. But yeah-- he looked HOT.  We headed for Richmond, and somewhere along the way, I fell asleep because the next thing I knew, we were at einstein's cuz the little piggy wanted bagels. Went to the apartment and fell asleep after doing something yummy. =P Woke up a few hours later and spent the most of the afternoon in bed. =] Ahh, catching up is so fun. So we finally fucked ourselves silly-- oops did i write that? ;) and decided to go to thai diner too for dinner-- mmm, MY FAVORITE! but had a few hours to kill. Can you think of a few things we did to kill the time? no, not that!! we went to see a movie!! =) We saw "Paycheck" with ben affleck-- which i thought was really good. it felt kind of weird to see a movie with jae-- we've only been to one once before-- but moreso because i associate movies with *e* because we used to go to the movies a lot.... It was weirdly similar being with jae, but then again, going to the movies is a generic thing, right? We shared a drink and a bucket of popcorn and affleck's character reminded me a lot of jae-- the mysterious engineer in the bio-tech industry. After, we went to TDT, for the best meal ever. i love the food there, i can eat it everyday. The papaya salad, the flounder and the basil beef-- omg, the best combo that makes up the best meal.  So after, we go to Tan-A and pick  up some stuff and come home to have some green tea ice cream and wine. After joshing around a bit more =o), we head out to the gym to get in a quick work out.

      its been awhile since i've last wrote. the year is coming to a close. i chose a shitty time to write because i'm kind of mad at the man right now. i don't know how to put into words what i'm feeling right now, but i guess just generally shitty would sum it up. just a warning to everyone else out there-- don't ever compare your current gf with the ex that fucked you over and then continue to defend her actions to no end.

      once upon a time i used to write poetry quite frequently and write my thoughts out far more in depth than i do nowadays. I guess being busy and growing up has made me more to the point and less creative-- to a certain extent anyway. I got fired from GatePlus last week. I'm very relieved, as I didn't really like the job all that much. But the worst of it is that I had forgotten to return the books and I got a nasty letter in the mail from the owner saying that its been a week and he has yet to receive the books, and furthermore I wouldn't get my paycheck until I return them. In a sense, it makes me go "WHAT A PRICK!!!!" Granted, I did say I would return the books, but I was sick and uber-busy last week, and was planning on returning them as soon as I got around to it. And he promised he would mail the check the following day. It made me realize what an asshole he really was.  On a brighter note, my sister and I made amends and are in a better conversation mode now. It makes me happy to know that we're talking again because even though we've had our issues-- like this whole 1/2 year long fight we had, I do deeply care about her and know that with her bad qualities come good ones-- like everyone else. I know we don't really get along and we don't see eye to eye on a lot of things, but she is my sister, and when we were growing up she always did protect me. (When she wasn't beating me up that is jk... sort of) Last night jae and i had a long talk about elmer. it made me feel icky in a lot of ways. i woke up still feeling icky. i don't like thinking about my relationship with elmer because in a lot of ways, i know i screwed him up pretty bad. Also, jae brought up the topic of me wanting to marry elmer. It kind of makes me sad to think that once upon a time i would have 'settled' for marrying elmer. and i don't like to think of that, because essentially, it was what i was doing and its not fair to do that for either of the ppl involved.  *sigh* anyway. . . its just a weird day for me. maybe i need some caffeine to pick me up. triple espresso, here i come.

      i hate fridays. i've realized that being in a long distance relationship is fine m-f when you're so busy working and planning your next day, but when it comes to the weekend, and you want to take a night off, and the person you want to be with is 3000 miles away-- you're faced with feelings of loneliness, restlessness and boredom. Being 20-something doesn't help because most of your friends are either married or in committed relationships and are spending friday night catching up with their honey or spending quality time with them. its friday night and i want to be curled up with my honey watching tv or talking, or going out for drinks... ANYTHING, but be here alone with my roommates-- 2 of which are a couple, and the other who is with her bf on the wknds.  it doesn't help to talk on the phone with him because its just not the same... i mean, its better than nothing, but its a million times better being able to be with him, see him, touch him.... i dunno... same ole shit i guess.  on a brighter note, i finished all of my classes for the quarter. the only thing i have to worry about now are my finals, grading my papers, and doing my interviews. and in 9 days i get to go see my honey!!! yay! =) its funny how much of my life has come to revolve around jae. it kind of scares me on a certain level because sometimes i can be fearful of rejection, and wonder if he feels the same way. But on another level, it feels soo good to be in this relationship, where i know he feels the same way about me as i do for him.  well that's all for now... ciao.

      it was a crazy week, i got a lot of stuff done, but realized today that there is so much more to do. this neverending list of shit to do is a little overwhelming. but thankfully, jae will be here in a week and maybe he can relieve some stress.  *** okay, sometimes to distract myself from work and to entertain myself, i read random people's blogs. its interesting because you start seeing patterns of the things people do, the things they write about, their thoughts, concerns, the things that make them happy... etc.  I was reading a few girls' blogs today (girls' blogs are always more interesting to me than guys-- i guess its a relational thing) and realized that i used to feel so special and so distinct, but we all do the same generic stuff. I miss writing poetry... i used to crank out poems like mad--- maybe 1 or 2 a day, and they were short, long, haikus, rhyming, all sorts. but i realized as i got older, it faded out of my life. i say that because the girl's blog that i read was filled with great poetry that a lot of girls write at age 17-20 (when we turn 21+, it seems like life's mysteries are unravelled and there's nothing intriguing to write about).  also, i went through some of my old emails and found my "neal" archive. we had an interesting dynamic, that cat and i. we had some great conversations and some really great emails. we used to write and talk about the most esoteric of things-- he is in some ways, still my #1 cultural informant, as i'm constantly learning about stuff from him. i'm glad to have him as a friend in my life at this point.  growing up is a funny thing. i hate saying that i'm "so grown" now, but shit, i'm old. 25. in some ways i have so much more to learn and so much.  it seems like there's so much negativity in my life right now. i really need to see a zen doctor or something. (are those even a real thing?) i just feel like i'm in a really unhappy place lately and i can sense it by the way i interact with people i don't like.  ah. screw it.  _.j._

      there's a very ugly part of me that i hate. its that little angry side of me that wishes not-such-nice thoughts on people that i'm supposed to care abt. one of my good friends got into 2 law schools so far (not the one she wanted to get into yet) and it kind of bugs me. there's a very ugly part of me that doesn't want her to get in anywhere because ... because... just because. i know that sounds awful, but it just is. maybe its because i'm envious, or because i feel as though she's undeserving, but either way, it makes me feel really rotten inside.

      i forgot how hard it was to read 100 pages a day.  anyway. i also forgot how annoying one of jae's friends are (name to be unmentioned). He's just a prick who is jealous of jae. We have been in email correspondence for the past few wks abt planning the little piggy's bday, (he made it explicitly clear that he would HAVE to see jae because they're both in cali around the same time) and the last email i got was a jerk move. First he tells me that he probably won't be able to make it, which is fine. The worst part is the end, where he goes on and on about how jae needs to lighten up and i should get him drunk. He goes as far as to say that jae is an uptight dude. its funny because he thinks he knows jae so well, when in reality he doesn't at all. and i'm not sure where he gets these generalizations and ideas abt jae from, because jae is so far from being uptight-- there's elements abt him that are kind of anal, but he's so damn mellow that it gets on MY nerves sometimes.  Anyhoodle. been thinking abt moving out on my own lately... it would be soo nice to have my own place.

      There's something about re-adjusting to grad life after a nice long vacation of only working half-assedly (not quite a word, but you get the meaning). I forgot that I'm no longer to go out whenever I feel like it and I have to discipline myself to work work work. The worst part about it is that I really don't feel like working because I'm kind of sick of being anti-social, lonely and stressed. Its a little like being in prison, having a taste of freedom and then being forced to go back.  So i percolated more on thoughts of the ex. it was kind of a weird warped experience to see him and for it to be completely platonic, and to not feel anything for him, because there really was this very familiar element about him. But in a weird way, there's a part of me that knows he will be better off without me, and knows he will become a better person too. In some ways I'm envious because I see him grow and don't understand why he couldn't have been like that when we were together. And I realize that it probably WAS because of me that he became so stagnated. And in that sense, I'm happy for him.

      haven't written in nearly two weeks, been busy, adjusting to school life, and everything else going on in my life. i had lunch with the ex today, it was nice, weird, awkward. nice because seeing a familiar face is always nice. weird because he seems the same, but different. and awkward because its always awkward seeing the ex, isn't it? when i looked in his eyes, i didn't see the love he always felt for me-- in some sense, it was relieving. in another sense, it was sad, because it signified that chapter in my life finally and really closing.  not really in the mood to write, so maybe after i percolate i'll write more.

      i was watching some random movie the other day, not quite sure what it was, but there was a line that stuck out in my mind. "There are a few people in life that are lucky-- lucky enough to be with someone who they're totally in love with as well as love." I know that its early in our relationship, but i feel like i'm in that lucky minority. not only am i totally in love, but i deeply care about jae and feel like i can totally trust him. its one of the greatest feelings in the world.

      Introspection can be a bitch. Funny, because Charles Mead, one of the leading Social Psychologists say that the self is fully developed when we are able to see ourselves from other people's perspectives-- through the "looking glass. " But what happens when you're absorbed with the looking glass and have a skewed vision of how other people view you? I have this distorted view of how other people view me because I have a distorted vision of how I am. Why? because I tend to be paranoid and insecure. And for some odd reason, these feelings beget masochism and prompt me to do odd things that further perpetuate my insecurities. In some ways, its my fucked up way of coping and my own weird therapy. But that's an a priori way of thinking about it.   Of course I'll say after the fact that its therapeutic... but is it really? or is it simply me, being my usually masochistic psycho self? I'm still as insecure as ever and those feelings bug the living shit out of me. I hate the fact that I feel like this. Maybe that's why I'm constantly trying to confront my insecurities-- its always been a coping mechanism for me for everything else in life-- take what's problematic and make it ten times worse to see how far I can push it.   its sick, really, and I wonder, sometimes, if it perpetuates the problem rather than fix it. Maybe living in avoidance is a better tactic, perhaps if I just ignore them they'll go away... funny, when my parents taught me to ignore things, i delved into them more. .. it always came around and bit me in the ass.   Are insecurities one of those things you ignore until they go away?

      trying to think of a happy place but i can't get jae's words out of my mind.  "You just say you want to go through the bad stuff, but in reality you don't. You say it just to say it. You really want to just have the good stuff..... why don't you get a guy that doesn't have baggage? Get someone who's never fucked a girl before! Get someone who's never loved anyone before! Isn't that what you had with Elmer? Go back to him! Maybe you should get an 18 year old virgin like your mom wants you to."   what do you say to that? "ok! maybe i will!" shit.     i dunno what to do. it feels like my world is crashing down on me

      stupid stupid me... i had to know. so i logged into jae's friendster account and saw that he can view his ex's new bf's profile, even though he told me he couldn't. now this is gonna bug me all night. *sigh* why do i have to be so fucking anal about knowing everything? it wasn't even about that though, i wasn't doing it to check up on him, it was more because i was bored and couldn't sleep and wanted to re-read the mean letter he wrote to thuy. but out of curiosity i checked if he could view it and it turns out he can. i know he wouldn't lie to me, but maybe he didn't want to hurt my feelings and he did. now i feel shitty because i dunno what to believe and what not to believe. this is crap. i hate feeling like this.   anyway. i'm gonna try and sleep yet again. hopefully, all of this can be cleared up in the morning.

      Wow, its been over 3 months since i've posted on here. I guess I've been really busy-- actually, yah i have. Finished my masters' thesis-- yay! its pretty exciting and scary, but i'm glad this year is almost over. I'm in virginia right now and feeling lonely and sad and scared. Jae is at the hospital on call and won't be back until tomorrow morning, so I'm just trying to entertain myself. I did something I really shouldn't and now i'm affected by the aftermath of it all. I feel nauseous and sick and sad.  What is it about the ex that bothers me so much? I guess in some ways, its very multi faceted.  1. the fact that we have so much in common bugs the living shit out of me. i hate this means that my relationship with jae in some ways is reminiscent of his with hers. it hurts me that its not original or new for him.  2. the fact that she is prettier/cuter/more attractive to me. i know jae tells me over and over and over, but this is my own body issue. I hate my body, i know she's a much smaller frame than me, and it drives me nuts, because i'll never be her size. in some ways, my breasts which are too big are a huge issue, because i know jae is not into big boobs. and a part of me wonders if when he suggests i get a breast reduction if its to mimic hers. i know it sounds ridiculous, but i can't help but to wonder sometimes.  3. the fact that we're so different. its stupid, right? one the one hand we're so similar and on the other, we're so not. And the differences makes me question what it is that jae sees in me.   I don't know. all of this has to do with ME and my insecurities. Jae is going to get mad at me when he reads this. I know he will because he hates that i'm insecure and hates that she affects me that much. in some ways i don't want to talk to him about it because i know he gets irritated with it. i don't know what to do about it though, because its always lingering. and in a lot of ways, its gotten better-- its gone away SO much, but in some ways i know it will always be there. I wish i could just move on, and let it go, but its hard for me. its hard because i've never been in a relationship where i loved someone who loved someone before me, and its a weird difference. With elmer and i, everything was so new, and everything was different. I don't know if jae had that experience, but i know he was thuy's first real bf. So in some ways, perhaps, in some ways, i'm his first gf who loved someone before too.  Which leads me to my next big insecurity--  that if i am his 1st to have loved someone before, why doesn't it affect him as much as it affects me? It doesn't seem fair or right that i hurt so much from this stupid girl that he dated 4 years and he isn't bothered by my 9 year relationship or my other 2 minor ones. and if he is, he doesn't show it!   its stupid. its all very stupid and trivial. i'll be the first to admit that this all stems from within me and its something that i need to deal with. i guess that's why i'm writing at 3:30am, and not being able to fall asleep... i just need to work this all out and try to get over it. its so hard, because i know it stems from feelings within me that need to be solved first. i know i need to not be so insecure and so hateful of my body and the way i look, because that's where it all comes from. but its so hard, especially in a world where 100 lb asian girls are touted as beautiful and that i am definitely not.  i know jae loves me and tells me how hot he thinks i am, but its hard to believe when i look in the mirror and don't see someone who i think is hot. i keep telling myself maybe if i lose more weight, it'll go away, but i remember feeling like this even when i was much thinner, and that is the sad part.    it's just stupid beauty ideals and in some ways-- moreso the ones i construct in my head. and the irony is that i'm an educated sociologist that fights against shit like this and yet i'm probably most affected by them.   oh well. what can i do. time to go fold some laundry and wait for my bubba to call me.  *sigh* sleepless in richmond, j

      I had a really disturbing dream last night, a nightmare, probably being a more accurate descriptive term. I didn't sleep until 4am because I wanted to stay up and wake Jae up before he went to work. But I woke up at 7:30 in cold sweat and more than a little freaked out. It was one of those uber-realistic nightmares that you can't really shake and you wake up thinking it was real. It went something like this, I wish I wrote it down right when I woke up while it was still vivid and fresh in my mind, but I can try to re-create it 3 hours later... -Begin- Jae was visiting and I was preparing a lesson plan for my class the next day. I was TAing for Ruben's Race and Ethnicity class and I was trying to make a creative project to help the students learn. Jae left, but accidentally took my phone, leaving his with me. He said he was going away with a friend, that was a girl, which made me feel kind of weird. I found out a couple hours later that the girl was someone I knew from college, this pretty Filipino girl named Roseanne. I started to freak out wondering what the hell was going on, and why Jae had to cut his visit short to go on this trip with a girl he never knew.  I called my phone and she picked up. I freaked out. I asked her if they slept in the same bed. There was an awkward pause. "No." she said. I hung up and couldn't sleep the whole night, and made feeble attempts at creating a lesson plan. Thoughts of Eric's lecture on non-monogamous relationships and sex separated from emotions ran through my head, distracting me and making me question my reactions to Jae and Roseanne. I gave feebly attempted to eliminate any reaction I was having and tried to create some rationale for why Jae would do this, that it was ok for him to do this, and that we could have a relationship in spite of him sleeping with other women. But I knew it wasn't likely of Jae to have meaningless sex, and therefore he had to have some emotional tie to Roseanne.  I got in my car and without packing anything, just drove. I drove for days across the desert to see him. I ended up in a small beach like community-- the kind that Jae and I talk about raising our kids in one day. I call Jae and ask him where he is, and is partially yelling at him. He tells me to calm down. I finally find them, Scuba Diving. I am able to see them through the glass panes in the store. The water is clear, and amidst a colorful display of sea animals, plants and other sea life, I can see them holding hands and snorkling through the water. She is tan, and has a thin, lithe and gorgeous body, wearing a tiny white bikini. He is wearing a red bathing suit, also tan and gorgeous. I am shocked to be able to hear their conversation. They are talking about how much they adore one another and their future plans for August. August. August! August is when I was planning on leaving Jae to go teach in California!!! They climb the steps and I meet them both on a bench. Roseanne looks uncomfortable and walks away. I ask Jae if they were sleeping together. He doesn't need to say a thing, I can read it on his face. I ask him why he was doing this, what he was doing with this girl. He tells me I'm overreacting and to calm down. I try to calm down and end up crying instead. I tell him to hold me and he holds me in his arms and I bury my face in his chest, inhaling the scent I've come to love so much. I feel distraught, confused, unsure of how to go about this.  Roseanne comes up, I feel insecure about my body, wondering if perhaps that's why he chose her over me, because he wasn't attracted to my body. She hands him a bottle of water. I glare at her, and start yelling. Jae shakes me and tells me to calm down and not to yell at her. I am shocked that he is defending her. She, all the while, doesn't say anything and picks up her bag, walking away. I am furious, wondering why Jae would do this, how he could hurt me like this. I ask him, "Would you still have gone out with this girl if I stayed with you in Virginia past July?" He first looks surprised, but then honestly answers, "no." Guilt spreads over me at first, but then I realize how stupid I am reacting by feeling guilty. I walk away angry. Down the dirt road is a fruit stand, and I see my aunt, mom and sister there. Upon seeing familiar faces, I start crying, and attempt to incoherently tell them what happened. They are angry. My mom starts yelling at me, saying that I should take a look at myself, that I am a slob and that is why Jae is cheating on me. Then she re-directs her anger and starts yelling out the door towards Jae's direction, where he is standing on a wooden bench. After calming them down, I realize I still have Jae's phone and he has mine. I yell out the door, "Give me my phone back you motherfucker! You are a disgrace to my family!! You are a disgrace to my family!!" [which I'm not quite sure from where it came]  My family take me to a hotel room and I fall into a fitful bout of sleep. -end- I woke up this morning, with the sun shining on my face, the breeze across my body and I thought I was in a seaside village somewhere. In my half slumber, I rolled over, looking for Jae. When he wasn't there, I freaked out, thinking I was living my dream. It took me awhile to register that it was, in fact a dream. I frantically looked for my phone, wanting to call Jae to hear his voice to reassure me that all was well and It really was a dream.  When I saw that I had my phone, not Jae's, I was more than relieved (because in my dream I had Jae's phone, remember?) and was sad when he didn't pick up the phone. I left him a voice mail and laid there, in a daze. Thankfully, he called back within minutes and I told him about my dream, crying. He thought it was cute and told me that everything was ok.

      I haven't wrote in almost over a month. I haven't had much time to write, and moreover, nothing to really write about. Life has been ehh.... Laker playoffs have been hard on me because it has been bringing back some memories of E and some of our nice moments. Nostalgia is nice, but it also makes me sad. I don't exactly miss E, but I guess I miss some of the moments we had, watching tv together, our weird pseudo talks, and the places that we used to frequent. I guess in some ways its what Jae says, its the companionship aspect of it. It makes me sad to miss that part of my relationship, because I think I realize that more and more Jae isn't a replacement, but a completely different person, a completely different relationship. On the one hand, it makes me sad because I'll never replace what he had with T. But on the other, it makes me put everything into perspective and realize what we both had in the past is in the past, and those relationships were good for what they were worth. What we have now is its own distinct experience. Its so easy to say, but its so hard to feel. I guess its because in some ways I'm still tied to Elmer and I know I'll always feel tied to him. And that means that Jae is still tied to T and always will be in some way. I guess its hard to accept that the person you're with doesn't completely take up your being and vice versa. You want to be that person's everything and anything, and its hard to accept that in some ways, you'll never be what the ex was to him.  Its a weird thing though. How do you measure what you are to this person? Is it like a recipe?  1/3 oz Baby Talk 2 cups Sexuality 2 cups of Romance 4 cups of companionship 5 cups of great talks mix together, stir well, bake at 500 degrees for one year?  and then its like well what if she had 10 oz of baby talk and 5 cups of sexuality, and 5 cups of Romance, 6 cups of companionship and 6 cups of great talks AND 10 cups of chocolate chips!?  Just a thought. I guess each recipe is original and different and the whole is generally greater than the sum of the parts. Sure she may have had components that I didn't, but I have things that she doesn't and either way we're both very different people. (or are we?) Maybe she's like creme brulee from TGIF and I'm like creme brulee from Ubon. (So kidding right now). but i guess increasingly i'm ok with that. Its like Jean said. she's like "ehh, plain," and i'm like "BAM!" (I just found that funny).

      Racism in the South   I've visited VA quite a few times now. Jae seems to get frustrated at me when I make statements about it being an odd town, racist and lacking culture because he says things like "you can get ethnic food here and there's lots of minorities." It goes beyond just the multicultural aspect (which is questionable) of it though... I can't really place my finger on exactly what it is, but its there. Once in a meeting with my advisor, after a conference in Atlanta, Georgia, he said that he and his colleagues "defintely felt as if it was a racist town... There's no overt hostile racism, but there is defintiely intangibly racist here..." And that's how I feel about VA.   I went to a fancy schmancy restaurant last night with a friend Nicole (who is white) and she was kind of embarassed about being underdressed (wearing jeans and a tank top). I think my outfit was suitable, white linen knee length skirt and a pink sleeveless sweater top. In spite of her self-asserted violation of the dress code, I noticed the staff would not talk to me, but only addressed her. This also happened when we went to Pottery Barn.   Today, I went to BN to get some coffee (because the StarFucks is inaccessible). I went to the counter... A white girl with reddish hair, piercings and tattoos looked at me expectantly, not saying a word. I said "Hi, can I get a doppio espresso over ice?" She stares blankly at me, not saying a word. Due to conversational norms, the time limit of silence is going way too long, especially among client-retailer relations. So I say "uh... a doppio espresso? its two shots of espresso..." She rolls her eyes and says "Yeah I know what it is. Our machine is broken. You can't have any espresso drinks. We have coffee, tea..." she rattles off a list of non-espresso drinks, at which point I'm kind of getting annoyed because I just woke up, this damn town makes it impossible to grab a cup of coffee and I WANTED MY ESPRESSO! So I pause, looking at the menu, not really listening to what she's saying.  "Uh.... Can I get a.... uh... a grande iced tea." Hell if I was gonna pay 4 bucks for some crappy frappacino just to get a caffeine fix. She gives me an odd look.  "Regular or Passion?" "Passion." "Sweetened or unsweetened?" "Unsweetened." I pay for my drink and she turns to tell the girl behind her what I ordered. I thought maybe I could hang around until the machine is fixed and have my espresso, I was in a bookstore after all... "So do you know when the machine will be fixed?" I asked. She shrugged and turned around to ignore me.  Now I can't really say that interactions such as these are really RACIST per se, but I have noticed that compared to the white folk, the service I get from retailers and restaurants is quite different-- markedly more hostile.

      Jae and I went to a BBQ at the program director's house. It was really nice... the house felt like a southern home. it was pretty big and very homey. The deck in the back was huge, and overlooked a large yard with a volleyball court, basketball half court and a rolling lawn. We had some wine and burgers and hot dogs. It was fun catching up with jae's friends.

      Today would have been Elmer and my 10 year anniversary. I realized that sometime this morning while having one of the worst tension headaches I've ever experienced. Maybe it was because I knew he would be sad or maybe I was really just ill, but I fell asleep and woke up to the room spinning... When I woke up, I saw that he IMed me about Farenheit 911, and told me how good it was. Part of me says its coincidence that he just "happened" to IM me today, but another part of me knows that it's his passive aggressive way of telling me that he's sad. Mind you, he never IMs me out of the blue like that. Some things never change.  I can't say that I'm pissed at him or that I'm even aggravated, but its more like I'm sad that he can't move on and let go of what we had. I know. Its only been a year since we've broken up, and we had a great history, but how long will it be before I can be completely sure that he's moved on? In some ways, I feel as if when I know that he has someone new that he loves-- more than me-- I will be happy for him and he will be much happier as well.   On a brighter note, things in Richmond are going well... I haven't spent as much time with Jae as I would like, but at least I get to see him daily, which is nice. I have been under the weather for the past week (Canker sores and headaches galore) so I guess its ok. I have to get used to the gloomy hot weather in the south... I miss California in some ways... I miss the sunshine and the availability of my friends. I guess the hardest part about being here is spending all day alone, and being lonely. Granted, I should be working, but even so, not having that option open is hard to adjust to.  In some ways, I can see how hard it was for jae's ex to adjust when she first moved here. Not that what she did was forgivable in any way or anything like that, but shit, it must have been hard for her. At least she had school to pre-occupy her time. It really is hard going from So. Cali to the boonies. You wouldn't think so, but I took so many things for granted. The fact that the weather was so much nicer is just one small thing, but the gloom of the Richmond really affects my mood... makes me depressed. Another thing is the food. The food out here sucks, and I don't know where everything is, so I basically stick to the places that I know, or Jae and my usual hangouts. I miss my usual favorite eateries in Cali.... I miss having my friends at a phone call's notice and my family 20 minutes away. I miss my comfortable bed and all of my pillows and things in my room the way that I had them. I miss my radio stations. I miss my kickboxing classes and my buddies in the classes that I would chit chat with before class.... I miss my crazy, alcoholic, drunk ass roommates that knock on my door at any given time and come chat with me about the most randomest things.   But for all the things I miss in Cali, getting to see Jae is well worth it. Getting to cuddle up to him at night, laying on his chest is probably the best feeling in the world. I know I'm being a baby about not being able to spend much time with him, and I should take my studies more seriously, but I think once I'm not sick anymore things will be ok... I just need to get back into my groove. Its just so damn hard.

      Its been 3 days since I've been in Virginia now. Its about 7:30 am and I'm watching some cheesy show on TLC wondering why I'm up so early on my vacation. I guess I could read and study, but not feeling like it and I feel a pounding headache coming on. I haven't done much since coming to VA, mostly just hung out at the apartment. Jae and I have been having a surprisingly "normal" relationship where nothing we do is extravagent or special anymore, but rather just mundane... which is nice. We eat dinner, hang out by the pool, cuddle up in bed, watch tv... the little things. Last night wasn't fun, i didn't get much sleep... hopefully we can get our sleep schedule in sync soon.

      Its funny how someone becomes a part of your life. Jae was once just a stranger to me and now I can't imagine my life without him. But sadly enough, life is odd in that someone that was once so close and dear to you, can also become a stranger. The irony is that even though you may consider them a stranger, once they were deeply embedded into your life-- as a significant other more specifically, they never will really be a stranger. I'm not only thinking of *E* when I say that, but also Thuy, because my relationship with E and Jae's relationship with Thuy may very well be over in all senses of the word "over," but oddly enough, if we ever run into our exes, I wonder what kinds of feelings we'd go through. I'm reading up on this guy's xanga who met his exgf for coffee years after they broke up, and he still had feelings for her. http://www.xanga.com/skin.asp?user=cowboybone&nextdate=4%2F1%2F2004&cal=1 If I were this guy's current gf-- clarification, he didn't have one when he wrote it-- but lets just say he did-- how would I react? I wouldn't like it very much, that's for sure. But I wonder, what if this was Jae and he went to see Thuy and found out she was getting married? How would he react? Would he share those feelings with me or try and protect me from that? And vice versa... is it even humanly possible to get over our exes completely? Maybe the 2.5 year rule is more plausible than not. ... A particular friend of mine is self centered and really is frustrating me. Part of me wants to bitch smack her and say "don't you have any idea how to be a friend?" But I realize that in friendships, or any relationship for that matter, the feelings that accompany those relationships have to come from within and no matter what I say or tell her I can't force her to be my friend and want her to do things for me. I am learning to let things go... and its sad that I have to let her go as a friend because its painstakingly obvious that she isn't a friend. The thing that hurts more is that she is dating one of my other best friends and he goes along with the territory. So I'm losing two friends, not just one.  ...

      Shopping with a friend is always a fun thing, but one thing that usually happens is that one of the two people end up with some down time to browse while the other is still fervently searching for clothes. While Jill and I were at the Limited, she was browsing through the jewelry section. While waiting for her, I was disinterestedly looking at some of the jewelry. A silver Tiffany’s knockoff caught my eye. On the linked bracelet, two charms were attached side by side. One was an oval shaped rock, and the other was a flat silver circle, resembling a coin of some sort. The rocks were different colors, one per bracelet, and the charm had some engravings on them. Curiously, I picked one up and on one side it said “Air.” I turned it around in my fingers and on the other side it said “Libra, Aquarius” (and some other sign that I don’t quite remember). A shiver of joy passed through my spine and I couldn’t help smiling. I picked up another one and it said “Water” on one side and again, it had the same sequence of signs, first Libra, then Aquarius. I took it as a sign that Jae and I were really meant to be. It was cheesy, I know, but when I picked up the next bracelet, I knew it was a sign from above, because it said “Fire” on the other side and the first sign in the sequence was “Scorpio.” The next was “Aries.” His ex girlfriend’s sign then my ex-boyfriend’s sign. What a coincidence.  …	 	I’ve been going through a series of epiphanies since I’ve passed my thesis, and I’ve been free from the evils of stress. I realized something today. Much as my world revolves around thinking about Jae’s ex girlfriend, I realized that she probably doesn’t care one bit about me or even him. Given the fact that she’s a self-centered Scorpio that cuts people out of her life like snakes shed their skin, its hard to think that she’s neurotic and paranoid like I am. So why am I letting this girl affect me like this? All of the issues I’ve had has been about ME, and MY insecurities.  	Jae is right, why should we let this stupid girl affect us, and unnecessarily harm our relationship? Slowly, insecurities about this stupid girl dissipates in my mind. I’ve come to realize that she lives her life, and Jae and I live our lives. She is dating someone new now. It is unsurprising that she jumps from relationship to relationship and is unaware of the lie she is living and the problems that she has. Though sometimes it still bothers me that she and Jae had something special at one time, I question exactly how “special” it really was given the fact that she is superficial and shallow in her relationships. The saddest part is that Jae thought it was so special, but I know it wasn’t. And I think now, he doesn’t think it was so special either.

      Jae thinks I should let out my frustration about Jean by confronting her and listing out all the reasons I cannot stand her. I personally think I shouldn't confront Jean for several reasons, partially because I don't want to lose Jarrett as a friend, but moreso because there's a part of me that thrives on pissing her off cuz I know she can't deal with me being better at her stupid passive aggressive game than she is. BUT, for the fun of it, I thought I'd make a list of "THE HYPOCRISY OF JEAN," or at least a list of the things that annoy me about her.  How she thinks the world revolves around her, sending out invites to her grad/bday 2 months early. And yet... does she go to other peoples' graduations? Or want to go to their bdays? No.  How she is flakey and late for everything, but gets pissed off when people are late and don't show up.  How she is FRICKIN RUDE to my family on Thanksgiving, and yet tells her bf how rude my family is to her!!! if you have a problem with my family, TELL ME, don't talk shit about me to your boyfriend, who also, btw, happens to be my friend!!!!  She talks MAD SHIT about her bf to me, and gets on her high horse about HOW SHE KNOWS HOW TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIP She talks about how she hates passive aggressive people and how people "should" confront her problems, but it is so OBVIOUS that she doesn't do that.  How she knows she doesn't want to be a lawyer, and she talks about how she wishes she were a writer or a grad student, and yet is still doing the law school thing. This speaks to me on so many levels. She is living life according to some wacky ass script she has in her head about how she "should" be, but is living a life of regret. You know, this list could go on and on and on. But Its getting late and I'm really tired. I will have Jae do the list instead. He's heard my bitchin enough to know... and he has a few of his own. *cough* like some people not paying *cough*

      had the weirdest dream last night. again, it was one of those twofold dreams that kind of made sense, but not at all. the first part, i was living in a strange small town that I've never seen before. it looked kind of like picadilly circle in London, but it wasn't. I think it was someplace in Canada. Jessica and Angie lived close to me and we were going to this model-thing, where models give you advice about how you should look. It was at this theatre that was showing some show.  Concomitantly, Jae was out of town and this guy asked me to go to this play with him as friends. So I said yes, not seeing any harm in it. The strange thing is, this guy is that online writer, Ben, whose stories I follow, and I'm excited about meeting him, and asking him all kinds of questions about his work. He comes to pick me up, and I remember wearing&nbsp;a floor length black skirt, a blue sweater type thingie and a pink sparkly pashmina. My fashion sense in my dream was shot to hell. It was weird cuz in his story, there's this scene when he takes this girl, evangeline, to a play, and it was as if my dream was emulating that scene. I remember feeling disappointed that he didn't comment on my outfit.  Before going to the play, he hangs out in my trailer-- apparently i lived in a trailer! and we are talking about random stuff. He asks me if I like him. I tell him I have a bf. He said that isn't a problem. I feel uncomfortable, so I suggest we head over to the play.  We get to the play, and I tell him to go sit down because I have to meet Jessica and Angie for the model-critique. Jessica is in line. I find her and tell her what happens. She is mad at me and tells me that I am being wrong. She goes down the faux runway, posing and meets the models. They tell her she is "FABULOUS!!" its my turn, I go down and they say everything is wrong, wrong wrong with me. I ask this black girl, one of the lead models what I can do to improve my look. She tells me my eyebrows are too low, and my forehead is short, so I should cut super short kwepie-doll-esque bangs and draw my eyebrows with a super high arch.  She give me some more pointers, and I go in with the girls into the play. The playhouse is huge, it looks kind of like the shrine auditorium inside. I look around, but cannot find that guy anywhere. I take my seat and am alone.  --  What a strange, strange dream.  time to have some filet mignon!!

      Yesterday was one of those days. Wait. Let me back up.  The week preceding yesterday was shitty. Jae and I were pretty tense because we were both pretty stressed and cranky at each other. We got in (minor) tiffs 3 days in a row about stupid things that made no sense. Tuesday, I was cranky because I couldn't sleep the night before and had to get up to take Jae to work and go to the library and get some work done. I was tired and cranky and decided to go home, and ended up doing nothing at all. He got mad at me because he wanted me to work, but I wasted the day away and he didn't get to have lunch because he didn't want me to waste my time driving out to bring him lunch. The next day, Wednesday, we got into some minor argument about something stupid, so stupid, in fact, that I can't even remember what it was about. Thursday morning, I was cranky because we both passed out the night before around 9pm and both woke up at 3am. He went back to sleep, but I couldn't sleep until almost 6, and had to get up at 7 to take him to work.  --  So yesterday, Friday, was a great day because after that shitty week of being cranky and tired and at each others' throats, we were back to our normal selves. It actually was normal on Thursday night, after Jae made us steak for dinner, we worked out, went to the pool and jacuzzi at night and fooled around after, watching South Park episodes.   We woke up the next morning, relatively early, and as usual, Jae made us some espresso in the morning, as we did our own thing... something I've come to recognize and like as our morning routine. We fooled around, doing a lot of nothing, and had some udon for brunch. We caught a matinee showing of the Bourne Supremacy, which was ok. I liked the first one, and I think Jae did too. But for a sequel, it wasn't bad. After the movie, we came home, supposedly to get our stuff to go to the library, but really passed out for a nap. We woke up and went to our favorite restaurant for dinner, Thai Diner Too.   In some ways, going there is like our second home. The servers know and like us and all come by and chat with us. I like the little things that Jae and I do, our morning routine, "our" restaurants, our late night giggles and hugs before falling asleep, these are the things that make our relationship real to me, these mundane and simple times are the defining moments that I cherish more than anything.   So after stuffing ourselves silly with  urlLink Papaya Salad , drunken noodles and flounder, we rolled ourselves out of the restaurant and into the car. We came back home and fooled around for a little bit before doing some serious work. We sat at the dining table, him where I usually sit to eat and me where he usually sits, and we worked.   When Jae concentrates on something, he gets this amazingly different facial expression that I find so damned hot. He was drawing some illustrations for a book and once in awhile I'd peak over my laptop to check him out. I was so attracted to him at that moment. He was wearing his new orange striped linen shirt from  urlLink BR &nbsp;unbuttoned, so I could see his muscular chest peeking out from it, while his face had a determined, intent look.   That moment, those 2 hours we both concentrated on our work is probably one of my most favorite moments with Jae. I know it sounds stupid, of all the things we've done, flying together, partying in DC, swimming, hollywood, bbqs, beach volleyball, las vegas, san diego, in spite of all of those things, this was above all, one of my favorites.   Sitting there, with him, watching him actually work had a strange calming effect on me. I liked our vibe together. Its a shame that he doesn't work at home more often, because in a weird way, I felt like we were really connected for that time.  --   urlLink my hottie

      What a wonderful weekend Jae and I had. Jessica, one of my best girl friends drove down from Philly&nbsp;with her BF Mark and spent the weekend with us. They got in on Friday night, a bit later than expected because of some heavy traffic they hit in Maryland. As soon as they arrived, we made them some martinis and we had cocktails while getting ready to paint the town red. We&nbsp;had&nbsp;tapas and cocktails at Europa, this great little mediterranean restaurant in Shockoe Slip. Ran into one of our friends, Terry, who is this really funny crazy/crazy plastic surgeon. Afterwards, we went to&nbsp;an Irish pub, Sine (pronounced Sha-Nay) for post dinner drinks. Ran into Terry again. After checking out the scene and talking to some random club/bar called&nbsp;RichBrau. It was pretty cheezy, but&nbsp;a lot of fun.&nbsp;Needless to say,&nbsp;all four of us were hungover&nbsp;the next morning, but we had to haul ass cuz we were throwing a BBQ at 2.   After some of Jessica's mad drama at the grocery store (haha) Jae and I cooked up a storm, making Korean potato salad (mm), Korean BBQ short ribs that were marinated 48 hours prior to the bbq; Apricot/Ginger glazed Chicken; Prociutto wrapped asparagus; rice; Baby Spinach salad with cranberries and sliced almonds and HUGE watermelon. It was, as Mark said "quite a spread, and tasty too!" (damn brits haha) But surprisingly, it was all gone. It wouldn't have been, but Jae's friend Lawrence (aka Evil Spirits Guy) showed up last minute, after driving 2 hours from DC to eat. He literally ate and ran.&nbsp; Jae told me later that he had to drive 6 hours total cuz he got lost and hit traffic on the way back. Damn. 6 hours for BBQ... he musta been hungry. heh. Played beach volleyball and fucked around in the nasty green pool all day. It was a lot of fun.   That night, Terry joined us 4 to have dinner and drinks at  urlLink Banditos , this cute little restaurant/bar/club. Jess and Terry are frighteningly similar. It's as if they are the same person. They were both telling bad jokes, doing the "jazz hands" and saying "Fo' Shizzle!" all night. It was hilarious. And Jae picked up on our 3 sayings that will get you through life pretty fast.&nbsp; It was funny because he&nbsp;kept saying them wrong and in the wrong context, but by Sunday Morning brunch, he had it down.&nbsp;They're pretty funny, we took them from old hip hop songs, and have decided that they fit in response to any context:  1. "If you stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready"  2. "Hey, it ain't easy being sleazy"  3. "It ain't ice cream without whipped cream"  Jess and I tested it during the bbq, and any of these 3 phrases will answer even the toughest questions. Our personal favorite is this:  "Does this outfit make me look fat?"  1. "Hey, it ain't ice cream without whipped cream... clearly you know that"  or  2. "If you stay(ed) ready, then you ain't gotta get ready"  or  3. "Obviously, you know it ain't easy being sleazy"  --  Banditos was playing some awesome music that night. I knew that when "Poison" (BBD's version) came on, it was game on! By the time that "Wild Thang" came on, Jess and I were almost post-orgasmic. After banditos, we went to the starlight cafe, which is this cute little dive bar. There was this fight that broke out, and we were all wasted. Went back to Banditos and some random girl asked Mark to take a picture with her, (he's a good looking guy) because "my tattoo matches your shirt!!" That was pretty comedy.  Sunday morning we were drained. Jess and Mark took off after we had brunch at Tara Thai and hit the Nordstrom's Anniversary Sale. Before leaving, Jess and Mark gave me this really thoughtful graduation gift.... i was taken aback because I really wasn't expecting anything. It was too sweet.  --  Seeing Jess really made me depressed on Monday because I realized how much I miss her while in Cali. Its hard finding good friends that you really, REALLY like, with no pretense and no harm or foul. She's one of those girls that I can totally be down with, without her pulling passive aggressive shit, or pretending to be superior to hide her insecurities. There is no snottiness with Jess, she doesn't think she's too good to act like a dork&nbsp;or thinks its immature to do "spirit fingers" with. At the same time, she knows what's good in life, knows culture, so when she is snobby, its totally warranted. On top of all that, she's&nbsp;crazy-wise, she can hold a philosophical talk and have deep conversations whenever....&nbsp;She makes me feel at home.&nbsp; Its hard to find girlfriends like that cuz girls are too fucking concerned about what other people think and are too insecure to really let go.   My favorite quote of the weekend was "You know THAT couple... some of you are with THAT couple." Oh. .. I know THAT couple alright. ;)

      I had a bizarre yet disturbing dream again last night. Just woke up a bit ago, and wanted to write it down while its semi-fresh in my mind. There were two parts to it.   One was this, I was living at Jae's apartment, but my parents were staying with me. My mom was at our old store, working, and my dad was at home taking care of some stuff around the apt with my brother. I made my mom a sandwich and dropped it off for her. On the way back, I picked up some burger king and gave it to my dad, not thinking twice. My old friend Tiny came by and I was playing with this long thick gold rope chain he had around his neck. I was wrapping it twice around my neck, and let him wear my thin one (Yet another thing that bitch rachel stole).  My dad seems to be in a bad mood, but i'm not quite sure why. He takes off and a little while later, my mom comes home really pissed off. I'm doing dishes, for some reasons, there's a lot and the water is not draining. She comes and helps and starts yelling at me. She says its all my fault that she and my dad got in a fight, that I should have made him a sandwich. I yell back, saying that isn't the reason why he was mad, that it was because Kenny (my brother) did something wrong. We start yelling back and forth. I pick up a butcher knife and wave it at her, telling her to shut up. She picks one up and we are standing at odds in Jae's tiny kitchen, pointing knives at one another.   My dad comes home and tells me that, indeed, it was my fault he was in a bad mood. He tells me that he hates burgers and can't eat beef. I told him he always ate burgers when he was busy around the house-- that I didn't eve think twice about it. He says no, he can't eat burgers. He goes on to list the things he likes, but for everything he likes, he has a critique of it. "I like fish tacos, but the fish isn't good quality."  --end--  The second dream was a bit more vague and still strange. I was at Jae's apt after being away for awhile and on the bottom shelf of the computer desk, I find two items that I find kind of odd. The first item is a mixed tape, with a bunch of cheezy love songs on it. The second is a flowery photo album, with no photos. They both have "To: MP" on the top right corner. I wonder who they are for. At first I think that they are for his ex gf, Thuy, but after rationalizing that it can't possibly be, because what the hell is MP? Then I think that maybe it is for me, MP being something cheezy like "My Poopiehead" or something. But I look on the tape and realize #1, its a TAPE, and why would he make me a tape and not a CD? and #2, I realize that on the tape there's a date that has the year 1998 on it. I get frustrated, realizing it was probably for one of his exes and he never gave it to her or it came back in a junk pile. I wonder if its Michelle, his brief ex gf. But I don't know her last name. The only thing that keeps running through my head is "Phan," its gotta be "Phan."  --end--  The irony is that Jean's last name is Phan. She even haunts me in my dreams. Now that's perturbing.

      * _ ~  I came to visit California for a few days, as I had an important meeting yesterday. It was a good time. I didn't get to see all the friends I wanted to (and saw one I didn't really want to) but overall, it was an A trip!   I love California, and realized how much I take it for granted. The weather was absolutely gorgeous, sunny and mild in the days and breezy and cool in the evenings. Wonderful!!!! Driving with my sunroof open and good music playing while the wind whips through my hair and sun pours on my skin is such a fabulous feeling.   Upon arriving Saturday night, I was supposed to meet my friends Angie, Laura, Melly and James (and a bunch of others) in Sunset, but I was too dead tired. My flight was miserably long due to the 30 some kids on the plane and it being 1/2 an hour late, We landed at 10:30pm. I couldn't get myself to do the 1hour drive to hollywood... I felt bad because James was in town for just one night from Scotland, and it was my only opportunity to see him. I will have to make another trip to the UK... =T  So instead of doing that I stayed home (while my friends took turns drunk dialing me all night-- I thought that was really funny) and talked with my mom. It was nice catching up.  Sunday, I hung out with my good friend Sam, and we met Jean and Jarrett for lunch. Aiya. I wanted to just see Jarrett because I haven't seen him in awhile and wanted some QT with him away from her, but surprise surprise, she didn't like that. So we enjoyed a tense lunch and kept the conversation superficial.   After, I went with my mom to Marukai, which they transformed into a Japanese 98cent store!!! I was stoked and went crazy buying dishes and kitchen utensils for Jae and I. We then went home and BBQed and waited until my sister brought my cutie nephew Nolan over. he's so cute!!! I was suprised how big he got and he lifts his head up all by himself now, and smiles when you come close to him. its the cutest thing ever.  Today, I had that early meeting and saw my classmates which was nice. I then had cocktails and appetizers with Jill and we met Tara and Christin for Shaved Ice. It was really fun. I'm glad I got to see everyone... it was great!  Even though VA is gonna be icky and gross in terms of weather, food, culture and people, being with JAe will make it all worth it.... how do I know? Because even though I was utterly happy in Cali, there was always something missing............ my doodoo... =)

      There’s something exhilarating about being with someone you’re completely in love with. After spending the 4th of July weekend with Jae in DC, I realize more and more how lucky I am to have him in my life. I feel as if we connect on so many levels. Physically, I’m so attracted to him; I can’t keep my hands off of him. We have such great chemistry, on so many levels. Mentally, we come from very different camps of thought, him, the hard sciences, me, the soft. And in spite of that divide, we are both incredibly over-analytical and critical of everything. Though we get in some arguments over politics and data and such, having him stimulate me, ask questions helps me theorize my work and be critical of the things I read. I feel as though sometimes I also teach him some things, and enlighten him (or corrupt him, hehe), which is a really cool feeling. On top of that, he teaches me a lot, things that I would never learned otherwise, stuff about medicine, his engineering, and art… all sorts of things. In terms of compatibility, we have so much fun together, dancing, drinking, talking… I love how open minded he is and how I don’t have to feel constrained with him. I love the fact that I can be me—completely with him, and not feel restrained. A great example of this was when we went to Adams Morgan and Erick brought us some cigars. I never tried cigars, and granted never really liked them either, but I wanted to try one, just for the sake of trying it. I really liked the fact that Jae not only encouraged me to try it, but also had one with me. He’s a lot of fun like that… always willing to try all kinds of things but still able to get his shit done. The kind of balance I need in my life.   When I was with Elmer, there was this constraint in our lives. I remember he would get mad at me at the mere mention of me smoking cigarettes. There was a phase that I wanted to try marijuana, and he never tried it either, so I kept asking him to try it with me. He thought it was a good idea, but in the end, refused, in fear of the consequences. Elmer is the type of person that lives in fear of a lot of things, which is where our relationship fell short on a lot of levels. We were too different.   Jae is like me though, we are both aware of the consequences of our actions, but are still willing to try new things, but know our boundaries. We are both social and will do a lot for the moment. Given, I don’t really want another cigar for a long (really long) time, the great thing about Jae is that I know if I ever want to have one, he will be right there with me, puffing along. And damn he looked hot smoking that stogie.

      I had a freaky dream last night, some of it in a blur, but I'm gonna try to re-cap it as much as possible. It was kind of weird because sporadically through the dream, I found myself taking the persona of different characters and being able to see through their eyes. -- I was in this very happy relationship with Jae, very much in love. But there was some things that didn't sit well with me, because I would notice odd things. Jae wasn't a doctor in my dream, he was a "rug salesman," working for a very strange Persian man. He was tall, thin and sinister looking with a huge nose.  So whilst I know this, for some reason, I took on Jae's perspective and receive a phone call from the evil Persian man, who tells me I have to kill Julie (me) and I (as Jae) am at odds because I don't want to kill Julie because I'm really happy with her. I am at this weird juncture where the guy told me if I don't kill Julie, he will kill me, and will kill Julie anyway. In a weird fucked up logic, I decide I'd rather kill Julie then let the mob kill her, and on top of that its my own survival that's at stake now.  So knowing that, I'm back to being me (Julie) and I am playing air hockey with my twin sister (who doesn't exist in real life) and I am getting annoyed with her because she is learning it on this mini table next to the actual table and flirting with Jae who is teaching her how to play. So they both come to the actual table and the clock is almost run out at this point. At the last second, they get the puck in and the clock goes off, indicating they've won the game. I'm pissed off because they caught me off guard and wasted the timed game. They are giving each other high fives and cheering. My twin sister is a bitch and she gets bitchier in the dream. She knows it bugs me when she flirts with Jae so she gives him a big hug and kiss, all while looking at me with a snide look on her face.  Pissed off, I venture off into the mall and feel as if someone is following me. Its very odd. I turn and notice a guy is following me, and he is carrying a gun. I start running, and run out of the mall and run towards my old neighborhood. I see Chris Aquino outside of his house and I  mouth the words "help me!!!" I stop in front of his house and out of breath, attempt to explain what's going on. A bunch of people from junior high are there with me, Caroline Ibasco being another familiar face (it gets weirder, trust me). So Chris tells me to duck into his house and his dad is talking to me with a Filipino accent. I can't really understand what he is trying to tell me, so I just wait in the house until I know its safe.  I'm back to being Jae. Julie's twin sister and I are walking around the mall, looking for her, and all the while I have this pressure to kill Julie. I know I have to do it and just don't know how I am going to go about it. I really don't want to kill her. I look over at Julie's twin sister, who the mob doesn't know about. She is remarkably the biggest bitch I have ever met. And it hits me, I can kill Julie's twin, and play it off as if I've killed Julie.  At this time, my cell phone rings, and it is the Persian guy, telling me that I have to kill her or they are going to do it for me. I tell him I'll take care of it and hang up the phone.  I'm Julie again, and wondering where the hell Jae and my twin are. I get sick of hiding so I leave the house and cautiously walk back home. My twin sister is there, and we get in a fight. I tell her to leave my boyfriend alone and to get her own.  I head over to Jae's apartment and find him half drunk and distraught. I ask him what's wrong. He tells me everything, how he got involved with the mob, and how they want to kill me. He is holding a gun, and with shaking hands, points it at me, tears rolling down his face.  I start crying, pleading him not to kill me. I tell him we can run away. That we can get awa from the mob. Amidst my pleas, there's a gunshot, a blast (I swear, I jumped in my sleep at the sound) behind me. I look over, he didn't shoot me. I open my mouth to speak. He hushes me and drags me out of the apartment. We get into his car, him not letting me speak. I figure out at this moment that the apt. and the car must be wired.  I sit in silence as we pull up to a dock. Jae opens his door, slams it, comes around to my side and does the same after pulling me out. He fumbles around for a bit and whispers in my ear to be calm and that everything will be alright.  From this moment on, I realize that I am pseudo-dead. In a strange way, I know that Jae killed my twin sister in lieu of me and that I must take on her persona. I try to do it, but its very difficult because we were very different. She was a shallow and superficial bitch.  Jae and I are driving to a party. I am no longer Julie, but Jackie. We never really talked about it, but lived our lives out as it were before, only now I'm Jackie, not Julie. Because his car and apartment were wired, I could never really talk about it to Jae. Strangely enough, I still trusted him. The dream ended with me in the car, looking at him and wondering if the mob would find out that he didn't really kill me and what would happen. A flutter of fear went through my body. -- I remember the strangest details from my dreams, and of them was the fact that Jae drove a white ML400, the classic Korean Mom car. what a creepy ass dream.
