						           One of the big issues in the public forum these days is whether homosexual persons have the right to legally marry people of the same gender. Can a man marry a man, or can a woman marry a woman? If you live in the state of Massachusetts, then the answer is yes according to its Supreme Court.  	The fact that Massachusetts allows same sex couples to be legally married is creating a shockwave and a legal nightmare. In Article IV of the United States Constitution is a section that says, "Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state." What this means among other things is, for example, that if you get married in a state, then all other states are required to recognize that marriage. There are homosexual couples who have been "married" in Massachusetts now going to other states to force them to recognize their "marriage." Because of this, there is a movement underway to add an amendment to the Constitution defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Personally, I support such an amendment. This is not a political statement but rather a moral one.  	The Sacrament of Holy Matrimony is under attack in our society today. The divorce rate in our country is over 50% now, couples are frequently opting to live together and have children out of wedlock, and now marriage is being relegated to nothing more than a secular legal state of condition as opposed to the sacrament that God ordained it to be.  	There really are two types of marriage: secular and sacramental. Secular marriage is a legal contract between two consenting adults to form a new legal entity for the purposes of employee benefits and government entitlements. A married couple files jointly on a Federal Income Tax return, for example. One's spouse has the say in the other's medical treatment if the person is incapable of making a decision. In Texas, a community property state, half of all income derived from one spouse is the legal property of the other. In the eyes of the state, the secular marriage is nothing more than a legal status. Any couple of legal age can go before a justice of the peace or other authorized government official and be married without any mention of God. We refer to that as a civil marriage.  	In the Church we have the sacramental marriage. Our canons require that for a marriage to be performed, it must be legal with a valid marriage license. This marriage is with vows before God and the sacramental exchange of rings before witnesses. This marriage is steeped in prayer and includes the blessing of a priest. As a priest, when I perform a wedding, I am acting as an official for the state and a priest of the church at the same time. It is a rare instance of the combining of church and state.  	[On a side note, I have known of legitimate couples who decades ago tried to get married in the Catholic Church or the Episcopal Church but were not allowed because of an arbitrary refusal by their priest, forcing the couple to have a civil ceremony. This was an unfortunate thing that caused many people pain. Fortunately, that atmosphere has changed.]  	The issue of gay "marriage" is another example of how it is hard to be a practicing Christian in our ever increasingly secular society. Our own national church has been moving toward the approval of blessing same-sex unions, thereby offering a level of sacramentality to them. That is at the root of our deepest divisions in the Episcopal Church today and within other mainline denominations.  	As a priest in the Church, I could never in good conscience bless a same-sex "marriage" or union. Everything in my prayerful study of Scripture, tradition and reason points away from the notion that this is God's plan in creation. In the places in scripture which refer to homosexuality both directly and indirectly, there is nothing positive or favorable about the subject. That is why I couldn't do such a thing as a priest. I didn't write the book; I merely work for the author!  	I truly believe it must be hard for people with homosexual tendencies to reconcile their struggles and feelings with the biblical teachings, and I believe in showing them compassion, but going against the authority of scripture, tradition and reason is not an option for me. Genesis 24:2 makes it pretty clear about God's intention of marriage: "Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh."  	Where society will ultimately go on this issue is difficult to say, but the reality is there is a war of sorts going on between the different sides of the issue. There may in fact be same-sex unions nationwide in several years, but making something legal in human law does not make it moral or in accordance with God's will or design. How the Church ultimately handles the issue could lead to the greatest schism since the Protestant Reformation. If and when that happens, and I pray that it does not, I intend to stand on the side of orthodoxy.

						   Something that has fascinated me for a long time is the history of the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804. A few years ago, I read Stephen Ambrose's book  Undaunted Courage , a good read about the journey from the time Thomas Jefferson conceived the idea until after the pair returned from their adventure. Even the name of the expedition, The Corps of Discovery, was a something that captured the imagination. What a great name for a team of such brave souls.  All of this took place in the infancy of the American Republic. We were only into our third president when Capt. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark answered the call to explore the newly acquired lands of the Louisianna Purchase and beyond. They really did not know what they would find as they made their way west. The area was so unknown that it was even rumoured to be the home for living prehistoric creatures like Wooly Mammoths and such.  When they started their journey, they carried with them something like two tons of flour and tons of other provisions. Of course, they couldn't leave civilization without carrying 100 gallons of whiskey with them either!  The detailed journals of their travels amaze me. They made maps, catalogued plant and animal life, and they even kept weather observations and surveys of the geography and native American cultures. This was all done as they at times struggled to survive against the elements, against starvation and a host of other challenges.  A few days ago, I was standing on the banks of the Columbia River on the Washington side looking across to Oregon at a place known as Maryhill. Almost two hundred years ago, the Corps of Discovery passed that very spot as they came close to their goal of reaching the Pacific Ocean. It took a couple of years to complete their mission, and they did it. What was approved by Congress for only $2,500 wound up costing something upwards of $38,000 in early 19th Century dollars. I would say it was taxpayers money well spent not unlike the billions of dollars that went to putting Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon in 1969.  The only tragedy from the story is that Meriwether Lewis apparently committed suicide after he made it home. President Jefferson noted he was a bit moody and depressive at times. Perhaps after achieving the greatest accomplishment of his life the end of the journey was too much for him.  After running out of stamps last night, I went to the post office this afternoon to purchase some more. When I asked the postal employee if she had anything new, she showed me some new commemorative Lewis and Clark postage stamps. Needless to say, I bought some sheets so I can join others in honoring those folks when I mail out my correspondence. That felt like a good thing to do.

						   Having returned from my honeymoon with my new bride, I am now looking to start my marriage off by giving my new wife less of me to love. My goal is to lose several pounds over the summer months and into the fall. That whole thing is not easy, but it is important.  There are all of those diets out there, but I intend to cut calories not with the fad programs and plans. Instead, I'm going to eat less and get more active. That sounds like a simple plan to me. It's kind of boring actually, but if it works, it works.  I could stand to lose about 50 pounds. That sounds quite monumental and daunting! I tried to pick up a 50 pound bag of dog food the other day and I could hardly lift it. That makes me think of one thing: Imagine what it would be like to be that much lighter.  As the saying goes, every 1,000 mile journey begins with one step. Well, here it goes...

						   Mr. Berg suffered a terrible fate at the hands of terrorist barbarians. I was so affected by the unspeakable horror of his murder that I gave it mention in my sermon this morning. There was nothing that could justify this act while the group chanted "God is great" in the background. It was nothing but pure evil. My God wouldn't condone the murder of an innocent man.  Evil is very real in the world. There are evil people with sinister motives who will stop at nothing to push their agenda of terror and domination. The group that killed Mr. Berg may never be caught and punished, but I take comfort knowing that they will face a greater judgment seat someday, and they won't be able to hide from the great Judge who will meet out his justice.  The killers said they did this out of revenge for the abuse of the Iraqi prisoners. The soldiers who abused the Iraqi prisoners were clearly wrong and should be punished, but Nicholas Berg had nothing to do with those crimes. In fact, he was in Iraq to help rebuild their country. Our leaders have apologized for the abuses, and I read that the prisoners involved are even going to receive compensation. I have yet to hear any outcry among Islamic leaders over the death of innocent Mr. Berg. Their silence is rather stunning and chilling.  Jesus tells us to love our enemies, and I'm praying for the ability to do that. I am also praying that the soldiers who abused the prisoners will be punished as well as the terrorists who killed Mr. Berg in cold blood.

						   Off and on for years, I have kept a diary of sorts. For the first time, I am using the internet to keep one, and for the first time, this one can be read by anybody.  I am into a new phase in my life. I just married my wife Becky two weeks ago today. We just got back from our honeymoon last Wednesday, and we are starting our life together in the rectory. (A rectory is where the parish priest lives.)  This blog will be my editorial journal of opinion and reflections based on my real life experiences. My writings will center around issues and current events both in the Church and in the world at large. What I write is my own personal opinion. I do not speak for the Church or anybody else. When I express an opinion, I will use "I" statements to express them.

						   Lately, I have been reading more books on church growth, congregational development and such. One thing that I read again and again is that we are now in a post-modern, post-Christian era. The paradigm of the old "Leave it to Beaver" style of church no longer works, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that is true.  I have been an ordained person in the Episcopal Church for nine years now, and I have experienced frustration at trying to grow the church. I have spent much of my ministry years trying to make the church relevant to my generation while, at the same time, having had to work with a church culture that still thinks it is the 1950's and that 1970's style worship is "contemporary!"  Church attendance is down, and one reason is that we are entrenched in a Rite 1 culture. Rite 1 is Old English. The Anglican/Episcopal Church was stuck in old English for 430 years from the time of the first Book of Common Prayer until the "new" prayer book in 1979. The problem is, the new prayer book kept old English in it to prevent the inflexible folks from leaving the church. Since then, many churches across the land still have services in the archaic, obsolete language of the 16th Century. I have never seen a Rite 1 service with strong attendance.  I lead our early morning service in old English, but to tell you the truth, it does not feel very authentic. I simply don't talk to God that way. I don't use thee, thy and thou to talk to God or anybody else. When I lead a service in Rite 1, I often feel more like I am reading out of a Shakespearian play rather than worshipping God. (I don't want to feel this way, and I try to work on that, but it doesn't go away for me.) When I turn on the news, I don't see Peter Jennings start the news by saying, "The president hath promised thee to maketh more jobs in the year that cometh." Who talks that way and who really thinks God talks that way? Jesus didn't even speak that way. He primarily spoke in Aramaic.  I hear people lament about the fact that we have too few young people in church, but when I start talking about the changes necessary to attract them in church, people get nervous. That is why other denominations (and other religions) are winning over younger people. They are reaching out to them in a meaningful, relevant way. We are just plugging along like it is the "good old days" hoping the young will show up on our terms. It is wishful thinking at best and poor evangelism at worst.  It is a serious problem and a dilemma. Were I to make ministry changes that would bring in younger people, I am convinced that many of the older people would become upset and either leave the church or withhold their sacred giving, and that is a no win situation. When the inflexible folks pass on, there will not be anyone to carry on their legacy. The Church will simply die off. The Church does not belong to any one generation. It belongs to God and is for all generations.  I love the people I serve very much, old and young, but I wish there were more people my age and younger. I have spent the last nine years serving mostly people much older than me. I have a deep respect and love for older folks for their wisdom, experience, faithfulness and goodness, but because of the demographics, I have performed more funerals than baptisms and weddings combined. I want to see some life, some youth, some growth for a change. It is going to take some serious changes for that to happen.  There is an emerging church in this post-modern, post-Christian world we live in. Right now, most of the Episcopal Church is clueless. My denomination seems much more concerned with who does what with whom in the bedroom than reaching new generations for Christ. I'm not even sure there will be an Episcopal Church by the time I retire in 30 years. All I do know is I want to be part of the emerging church: the church that meets the needs of the young without compromising scripture, tradition and reason. I believe that God is doing some exciting things and I want to be part of it.  I am praying that things will become clearer in the next couple of years. I want so much to make a positive difference in the Church. I want so much to see people my age and younger to experience a relationship with God and to enjoy the journey with them. All I can do is trust that God will make that a possibility someday.

						   Mike Melvill is not the first human being to go into space, but his rise above the earth's atmosphere today will forever change the face of space travel. Melvill didn't hitch a ride on a Russian spacecraft. He didn't go up with the help of NASA. No national government built the ship he flew. This time it was a private company that did it on its own.  Today, Scaled Composites did what even NASA cannot do with its grounded shuttle fleet. It sent an American into space, even if only for a few minutes. Melvill earned astronaut's wings solely on the efforts of free enterprise. Just as Orville and Wilbur Wright invested their own money to build the world's first airplane, Dick Rutan and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen launched a plane of their own into aviation history.  I am 37 years old, and for the first time in my life, I hold out the idea that perhaps I could go into space in my lifetime. Within a few decades of the Wright Brothers we had passenger planes. Within the next three decades, we may have passenger spaceships taking people into suborbital or even orbital flights. That is truly exciting.  The whole project for SpaceShipOne cost only $20 million. As Rutan put it, that is what NASA spends on a study paper for a spaceship. In space terms, $20 million is pocket change. This is going to put intense pressure on NASA to start doing some decent human spaceflight. Perhaps we will once again see flights from the Earth to the Moon as opposed to flights from the Earth to someplace near the Earth. If NASA doesn't do it, then some bold American entrepreneurs will!  Only in America could this kind of space leap take place. Our free enterprise system and our own human freedom is what has allowed our great nation to be the superpower it is today. As long as the government stays out of the way, the best is yet to come.

						   Once again, Islamic fundamentalists killed an innocent American in an act of pure evil. Paul M. Johnson Jr. lived and worked in Saudi Arabia for a decade, and his career there ended in tragedy after his kidnapping days ago. The Saudis apparently killed the leaders of the cell that committed the murder, and I hope the others will be brought to justice.  My heart goes out to Johnson's family in their terrible loss. It is not easy to console people who lose loved ones in such a horrific way. They are certainly in my prayers, and I will have Mr. Johnson listed in our prayers of the people Sunday.  One thing that I notice this time is that some Islamic nation leaders have denounced the murder. Statements from the Saudis, Jordan and even Syria expressed disgust at the act, which is a step in the right direction.  While I pray that no more of these murders occur, I am afraid they will continue as Americans become targets of terrorism abroad even as the terrorists seek to kill Americans here at home. We are in a war against evil, and evil must be defeated at all costs.

						   Someone once said that sleep is the symptom of caffeine deprivation. Of course, caffeine, this drug of choice to awaken the mind is trimethylxanthine. Now that's a mouthful. Let me make it easier by just giving its chemical formula:  C8H10N402 . Is that better?  Coffee is my delivery method of choice for this legally addictive stimulant. It truly is a bittersweet drink the way I like it, and that is with cream and sugar. In truth, caffeine is not the reason I drink coffee. I just like the taste and I'll happily drink decaf if it is after six o'clock in the evening.  A few years ago, when on vacation at Lake Tahoe in Nevada, I picked up an interesting book on the subject of coffee. It is a history book about coffee going back from prehistoric times until today in the age of the ubiquitous Starbucks. I learned so much esoteric coffee information that I decided to reread it this summer for a fun refresher. The book is Mark Pendergrast's  Uncommon Grounds : The History of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World .  Pendergrast writes about how coffee became the huge commodity it is today. Nations have risen and fallen over the production of the sacred beans. One thing of note is that when we buy a venti mocha at Starbucks for a few dollars we are paying more than what many third world coffee workers earn in a day harvesting the beans from the coffee trees. It is a reminder that we truly live in a wealthy nation set apart from a world of great poverty. Coffee is right up there with tobacco and cotton as a cash crop that has historically benefited the plantation owner at the blood and sweat of the plantation worker. Ever since I read about that, it has given me something to think about when I buy that latte.  When I was in Seattle, I marvelled about the presence of Starbucks on just about every corner along with numerous other coffee purveying establishments. Texas City does not have a Starbucks, but fortunately, I can drive about 20 miles to get a cup with the famous recycled cup sleeves to insulate the hot coffee from the drinker's hands. I might go to Starbucks once a week, but it is comforting that I can visit one anytime. My sense of civilization has forever been tied to the proximity to this ever important place! Okay... okay! That's a bit over the top, but it's not far from truth for me. As a shareholder of Starbucks [I own a single share.] I felt it was my duty to push the company a little.  Since coffee is such a big American beverage, I thought it would be nice to read some more about it. After all, some of my better sermons come with the help of the Holy Spirit and maybe even a little cup of joe. If anything, it gave me something to read while I drank my coffee.

						   Former President Ronald Reagan passed away yesterday. He was the president throughout my junior high and high school years. I remember being in a junior high school class when I heard he was shot outside of the Washington Hilton, and I remember crying as I prayed that he would survive his wounds.  Reagan is the reason I still lean Republican today. He and his party brought dignity back to the United States after a dismal Carter presidency filled with despair and pessimism. Reagan was the eternal optimist, and to me, he was like a grandfather figure.  During my junior year in high school, I saw him when he landed on Air Force One in Corpus Christi on a campaign stop. I was so excited to see him I was standing tall and waving with both hands. He looked my way, pointed to me, and gave a big thumbs up. I was proud that he was my president.  In a time when Europeans and American liberals were trying to appease the Soviet Union, Reagan was taking the Soviets head on and challenging them to their limits. In fact, he did it so much so that the Soviet Union collapsed from within. Reagan truly deserves the credit for the fall of the "Evil Empire." I'll never forget when Reagan gave a speech in front of the Berlin Wall. Right there, even against the advice of his staff, he challenged Soviet Premier Gorbachev saying, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!" Never in my lifetime did I believe that the Berlin Wall would be taken down, and just a few years after he left office, that is exactly what happened. It opened my eyes to the reality that the world can change, that change for the better is a possibility worth pursuing.  I saw to it that Mr. Reagan was mentioned in the prayers for the deceased at our Sunday services this morning. We placed our flag at half staff in his honor. The world is most definitely a better place because of the vision of a former actor who sought to serve his country in the highest office of the land. Thank you, Ronald Reagan.

						   Baseball is a great sports game. There is nothing like going to a ballpark and enjoying nine or more innings of relaxation interspersed with high excitement.  It has only been in the last two years that I fell in love with the game. Quite frankly, without having seen some full games, I used to think it was boring. But after attending some games, I learned that a lot goes on in a game when you know what to look for. For a lot of people, it's almost like church. You go and attend, but you may not necessarily understand what is truly going on in the liturgy. Once you know what to look for, the liturgy has great meaning. Baseball is very much like that.  Christianity is my first religion, but baseball is my second. There is a spirituality about baseball if you know where to see it, and I learned this from a book I bought when I was in Canada. Former San Francisco Giants pitcher Dave Dravecky co-wrote an excellent book with Mike Yorkey on baseball and Christian faith titled  Called Up: Stories of Life and Faith from the Great Game of Baseball.  Through a collection of 49 essays, Dravecky tells great baseball stories and ties them in to biblical teachings. It is a great, entertaining read. I found myself inspired often, and several times I gave belly laughs while reading it. If you want to learn more about baseball and God, then this is a book to get.  My favorite team is the home team: The Houston Astros. Over time, you get to know the players and their playing styles. Jeff Bagwell is fascinating to watch with his unorthodox batting form. Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte add great spice as well as others in the pitching rotation like closer Octavio Dotel. Houston truly has a great team, and Minute Maid Park is a beautiful expression of retro-modern American ballpark architecture. It feels like a family-oriented place and I can't wait to take my son Nicholas to a game when he is old enough to appreciate it.  Right now, I'm watching the Ken Burns PBS series  Baseball.  The documentaries show that baseball is rich in history. Watching the episodes makes me even more proud to be an American.

						   Martha Stewart was convicted for obstruction of justice in her insider trading investigation, a crime that has real victims. When she dumped her stock with illegal knowledge that other stock buyers didn't have, she in effect perpetrated a fraud against those individuals. Sure, it was done through a stock broker, but that doesn't change the fact that she hurt other people. Some of the folks who lost their investments because of Ms. Stewart may have lost their life savings. What was pocket change for Ms. Stewart might well have been very significant money for the victims.  &nbsp;  The attitude Ms. Stewart has shown for her victims is astounding. She truly believes she did nothing wrong, yet she started her career as a stock broker before she entered the world of baking cookies and decorating. She knew better!  &nbsp;  Not only did she get a slap on the wrist with only a 5 month prison sentence, she was defiant and acted like SHE is the victim in this whole situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;    urlLink ABCNEWS.com   &nbsp;  In her interview with Barbara Walters on ABC New's 20/20, I was further amazed at her arrogance and her poor character. Just go to the link above and see for yourself! When asked about her victims, she said, "I didn't go and cheat the little people. I just didn't do that. We're all little people."  &nbsp;  Get this: Martha Stewart then compares her going to prison by even daring to mention Nelson Mandela! Nelson Mandela went to prison in South Africa because he stood up to the racist oppression of Apartheid. Does Ms. Stewart honestly believe she is in a league with a man who courageously fought against racism? Does she think that her jail time is in the same category of doing time as when Dr. Martin Luther King was arrested for marching for equal rights for African Americans too?  &nbsp;  The truth is, Martha Stewart was greedy, and she allowed that greed to hurt investors, employers and all other stakeholders in her company. She has left a wake of despair for countless families, and she dares to make herself out to be the victim in all of this.  &nbsp;  If I were the judge in this case, I would have put Ms. Stewart in prison for 12 months with at least six months of house arrest after that. I would have ordered her to pay restitution to those who bought the stock she sold through insider trading, and I would have required her to spend two more years giving unpaid speeches to corporate CEO's and CFO's on what she did that was wrong and how our corporate leaders should practice ethics and business morality.  &nbsp;  On a lighter note, perhaps this Christmas we will now have the pleasure of seeing Ms. Stewart giving a holiday special on decorating your prison cell for the holidays. She truly is a piece of work.

						   According to a dictionary, the word  terrorism  is "the unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons." In recent months, terrorists have been seemingly getting their way as governments have caved in to their evil threats.   urlLink Dictionary - Yahoo! Reference   The latest example of this is the government of the Philippines after a threat by Islamic fundamentalists to behead hostage Angelo dela Cruz being held in Iraq. In response to the threat, Manila declared it would withdraw its troops from Iraq as soon as possible. Using terrorism, the Islamic fundamentalists have gotten their way in this case.   urlLink MSNBC - Manila says it will withdraw from Iraq : "Angelo dela Cruz"  A prior example of this was in Spain a few months ago. Islamic terrorists blew up commuter trains on the eve of a national election, and because of this, the voters overturned their government in favor of a political party that would withdraw from Iraq. Again, using terrorism, the Islamic fundamentalists met their objective.  This is a very disturbing trend. History has shown that appeasing evil forces only emboldens the evil forces. When the terrorists attacked Spain, they won a victory as the Spanish population gave in to their agenda. This only emboldened the terrorists to use the tactic again in the future, and it appears that now our government is worried that terrorists will try to use the same tactic to affect the outcome of our elections in November.   urlLink MSNBC - Exclusive: Election Day Worries   The more countries appease the terrorists, the more powerful and dangerous the terrorists will become. Giving into evil only makes evil stronger, bolder, and more threatening. That is why it is so vital that the United States stand firm against any terrorist threat.  I have given a lot of thought as to who I will vote for in the fall presidential election. Without naming names, I can safely say I will vote  for  the candidate the terrorists fear the most and  against  the candidate they would rather see in the White House. This election year, I pray that all Americans will use that as their standard for voting. Let's not give the terrorists a victory by voting for their candidate.  One thing of interest to me is that I stand in opposition to my own denomination on many of these issues. Our national Episcopal Church leaders tend to be pacifist appeasers. If our former Presiding Bishop had it his way, then Saddam Hussein would still be in control of Kuwait and possibly a sizable chunk of northern Saudi Arabia. One thing I firmly believe is that Christians have a responsibility to stand up to evil with whatever appropriate force is needed. I believe there is such a thing as a "just war" in church tradition and that there are times when war against an evil power is a lesser evil than allowing the evil power to do harm unchecked.

						   John Kerry picked his running mate today amid great media anticipation and the choice was Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina. This was probably a wise VP choice for the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party. Kerry is as dry as Melba toast, and so having someone with the charm and personality of Edwards will certainly complement the Democratic ticket.   Now that the candidates are set and once the respective party conventions take place, the presidential race is going to heat up in what is likely to be another close race. Between now and then, more people are probably going to be interested in who is playing the the Major League Baseball All-Star Game and whether the National League or the American League will win the game.   In 2000, George W. Bush did not have a majority of the electorate and so he entered office with little or no mandate. With the problems in Iraq and the economy, Bush has suffered greatly in the polls concerning his job approval and his reelectability. On his side is measured improvement in the economy and a growing stability in Iraq now that sovereignty has been handed over to the Iraqi people. Barring any major catastrophes, this looks promising for President Bush, but Kerry has the opportunity to get his message and sway the voters if they like what they hear.   Regardless of who wins the election this fall, I give thanks that we live in a country where violence will not decide who will lead us. I give thanks that we have a democratic process that can inspire the peoples of the world. I just pray that both campaigns stay above ground and avoid getting nasty and such. I want our leader to be elected on well argued issues and not through slander and deceit.   Between now and November, I am praying for both our President and for his challenger. I am also praying that the one chosen by the people will be faithful and put the nation's security and welfare above politics. The greatest nation on the earth deserves nothing less.

						   I was in disbelief when I first saw this article online. As if we were a third-world banana republic, we are going to have the United Nations observing our national elections this November. The United States, the first and foremost democracy of the world, is going to be monitored for election fairness by a foreign entity!   urlLink CNN.com - International team to monitor presidential election   Upon reading the article, it appears to be the result of a political tactic by the Democrats--a new low in American politics. Are the Democrats afraid we are going to break out in civil war if our November election is close like it was in 2000?  Not only is this demeaning to our standing as a democratic power, but it sends the wrong message around the world saying our democracy is in peril. The United Nations is a corrupt and ineffective institution, and the United States should do nothing to defer its sovereignty to this messed up body. Unfortunately, the Democrats seem bent on bowing down to this obsolete organization, and that concerns me greatly. I'll be looking to see if John Kerry's campaign has anything to say about this.

						   I love music. I have had a gift for music, but I never developed it to the point that I would like. I have played the violin, the cello, the piano, the Native American flute and the acoustic guitar. My favorite instrument is the acoustic guitar.  The sound that an acoustic guitar makes is wonderful. I am not talking about electric guitars here. They are fine for people. What I am talking about are those tonewood instruments with steel strings. The sound of wood and steel makes for a lovely combination.  Luthiers make acoustic guitars, and there are many fine guitar makers out there. My favorite one is Taylor Guitars in El Cajon, California. They make some beautiful, wonderful sounding guitars.    urlLink Taylor Guitars   I own two Taylors right now. I have a Taylor 810 dreadnought which is their flagship model, and I also have a Baby Taylor for travel or sitting in my office. The 810 is made from Indian rosewood and a sitka spruce top. It is well adorned with inlays and it produces a rich, booming sound.   urlLink Taylor Guitars \ 810   I have been playing the guitar for a number of years off and on. I most play chords, but I'm working on flatpicking and hope to develop some fingerstyle playing. The joy of holding my Taylor 810 motivates me to keep trying.  One thing I like about being a Taylor owner is that you become part of the Taylor community. They even send out an excellent quarterly newspaper called  Wood & Steel . I look forward to receiving it every season.  Another neat thing is Taylor got together with Windham Hill music to produce three CD's called  Sounds of Wood & Steel . They are wonderful to listen to in the car and they, of course, feature artists playing their Taylors.   urlLink Windham Hill: Sounds of Wood & Steel   These guitars are like works of art. There is great beautify and craftsmanship that shows through and through. These guitars are not cheap as they are high end pieces that command prices for the excellent quality. They are works of art.

						   This past week, a group of anti-Kerry Vietnam veterans aired a scathing commercial claiming that John Kerry did not deserve the medals he won for his service in Vietnam. A link to the site and the ad is below:   urlLink Human Events Exclusive: Vietnam Vets Blast Kerry in New TV Ad   This commercial is very disturbing. On one hand, some of these vets make claims that Kerry lied about his war service. On the other hand, none of these vets actually served under his command on the swift boat.  While the vets who made this ad may be quite sincere, it is clear that other sincere veterans were willing to stand on the stage with Sen. Kerry at the Democratic National Convention. One of those vets personally claims that Kerry saved his life.  Here is my concern: Whether the charges that the vets in the ad made are true or not, there is something deeper at work that undermines every soldier who has won medals for valor in defending our freedom. John Kerry was awarded three Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star and a Silver Star for his service. The United States Navy saw it fit to award Sen. Kerry these medals decades ago. By questioning the validity of Kerry's awards, this vet group is opening the door to question  any  veteran's medals.  Do we really want to go down that road? Do we really want to demean the meaning of the awards our military has given to brave men and women over the years by accusing the military of awarding medals to people who did not deserve them? Doesn't that put any medal winner in question if we then have doubts as to the military's methods of awarding decorations?  As you can see, that is not a good thing. In my opinion, if the military awards a medal of valor to a soldier, sailor or airman, then we should  assume  that the recipient was worthy. Quite frankly, anyone who is willing to put himself or herself in harms way for our freedom deserves a big medal as far as I'm concerned.  Did John Kerry earn his medals in Vietnam? The military says yes, and that's good enough for me. If the veterans in the ad believe otherwise, they are entitled to their opinions, but questioning a decorated officer's service has no place in American politics or anywhere else for that matter.  I am glad that the Bush Administration has distanced itself from this ad. Yes, the folks who financed the commercial are obviously Bush supporters, and there also have been Democratic soft money groups that have put up ads that blamed Bush for a racial lynching too, which was highly inappropriate. These types of ads do nothing to further our great democracy.  Both Bush and Kerry served our country in the military, and we should be grateful to both of them. Now let's get on with the important issues like our national security, our economy and our future.

						    urlLink JibJab   This is quite a funny online cartoon spoofing the election. I thought it was fair and balanced funny, and so both sides of the political spectrum might get a laugh out of this. Enjoy!

						   Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 911  is being portrayed as a current events documentary, and the film has certainly been the source of controversy in recent months. According to the dictionary, a documentary is "Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film. "   urlLink Dictionary - Yahoo! Reference   There have been numerous charges that Michael Moore used cut and paste editing in his film in such a way that quotes from President Bush and others were taken out of context to sound ominous and such, and the Fox News Channel has done a good job of showing some of these twistings of the truth. One item of note is in today's Fox News website:   urlLink FOXNews.com - Special Report w/ Brit Hume - Political Grapevine -  Moore  Hot Water   In a nutshell, Moore took some images from a newspaper out of context and made it look like the newspaper reported a different outcome of the 2000 presidential election. You can click on the link above to reference this information yourself.  Michael Moore is a man with a far left-wing political agenda, and his production of  Fahrenheit 911  was meant to further his agenda. The problem is, Moore has not produced a documentary based on fact as the definition of the word   documentary   shows. Instead, he produced a piece of left-wing propaganda. According to the dictionary, propaganda is "The systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or cause."   urlLink Dictionary - Yahoo! Reference   Unfortunately, there are people who have been misled by Moore's documentary to believe the Bush administration is evil and deceitful. The irony is that Moore's film is in itself deceitful. He uses unethical methods to get his message across by breaking basic standards of journalistic integrity.  Had Moore's movie been based on fact, then it would have been a documentary that would have allowed its viewers to make up their minds based on the facts. Instead, Moore created a propaganda piece that seeks to influence the public with half-truths and out-of-context quotes.  Regardless of one's political leanings, presenting the facts means presenting the truth. Unfortunately, Moore has failed miserably in this endeavor.
