       urlLink              Band of Brothers             They're a band of brothers     Who fight for our freedom     Who risk their lives     And get mistreated.          They go to a place     So far from home     Where freedom is not a value     Their people own.     They go with pride Courage and commitment     Fighting each day     Fighting each minute.          Sitting in trenches     Of dirt and mud     Watching and waiting     For the enemy to come.     They're there for a reason     They know what for     They're there to bring freedom     Through this operation of war.           By Andy Tremmel Copyright 2003

        urlLink      The Sacrifice For Freedom   I'm a soldier creeping forward only thinking of my brother I would rather kill myself then leaving him only with my mother.  I left the base with my partner, creeping side by side. Then we were attacked, my partner had just died.  Shot with a machine gun, the bullets pierced his head. He didn't feel a thing, but you could tell that he was dead. I wish to hell that he had screamed, but all that he could say was something I will not forget, not until my dying day.  He said, tell my folks I'm sorry for joining the army; but even though I will be dead, tell them not to be sorry. For I'm the one who joined, not cramps nor ma or day. Just tell them I'll see them in heaven. I'll be waiting for them all.  Then he let me go, leaving with a final gasp. I cried and cried and screamed for help, but the enemy only laughed. They took my friend and buried his corpse, leaving themselves to boast.  He gave his life and so did I, now that's what freedom costs.  By Jerome Dixon Copyright 2001

      Those Willing To Fight  In these past few days and in the weeks ahead, much has happened, there will be more I dread. I know deep in the very depths of my soul, what we do is something righteous and bold.  Freedom you see, not a God given right, But something given to us all by those willing to fight. Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen alike, whose blood was shed for our constitutional rights! Some fought right here to form the USA.  Some fought and died in lands far away! One thing remains true, even today, as our men and women fight. They are protecting freedom. They are protecting our lives.  It's not just freedom for you and me. It's freedom for all in the world, don't you see? 9/11 took more than just American lives, it touched thousands of lives in the world, that's why we fight!  To stop the evil that lurks about, we vowed to find them all and root them out!! So please stand strong and try to unite! You don't have to agree with this war that we fight.  Just think of the freedom's each day you enjoy, and then of the families with loved ones deployed. They are all fighting to keep this world free, from terrorist and ALL that support them. Can't you see!  Pray that we are successful in our fight, and that the Iraqi people will be freed from their terrible plight. So I will as again, think, please before you speak. The word you say can cause great grief! To those Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen alike. Your words tear at the hearts of those willing to fight. It insults their families and disrespects all they sacrifice!  Please don't forget why we are free. Respect the flag, display her for all to see! One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all! Don't you remember those words, have you forgotten them all? To all of those willing to fight, God Bless you for your courage and sacrifice!  By Andrea M. Paterson Copyright 2003   urlLink

       Thank You Troops    A question sir I pray to ask    Whatever enticed you to this task?    Here you are so far from home    Unfamiliar lands you're forced to roam    The sod beneath your feet is wet with the blood of comrades sweet perils and hardships grip you on every side from tears and guns you can not hide    Daily when facing the foe you never know will this breath be my last?    Please sir, why such a difficult task?    Good things my lad are hard to attain and freedom son comes with a stain    This life I entered young and brave now I'm old and headed for the grave.    But regret never will I it's reward enough to see our flag fly A plea I have for all remember those who heeded the call    See the flag up yonder?    That's why I was willing to wander.    The tears are flowing down my cheeks I try but I can not speak A message now I'll write or I shan't sleep tonight.    A debt of thanks to you I owe and I long to tell you so.    May heaven bless you each and every day Guide and protect you all the way.   By Jenny game Copyright 2004   urlLink

         In a time when our country needs them the most they will go. They will not bitch, kick or scream that is not their way. They will stand when most would run away. Some will jump at the chance to defend our way & others will go for reasons unknow. Those few brave souls are close friends of mine. September 11th is a day that will echo in our minds forever. That day one flag stood tall in an office space. It read United States Marine Corps !! The country was hurt &amp; bleeding from inside, because of a few screw balls running loose. Out from the ashes another flag rose to the top of a bent flag pole. May go have mercy on their souls, because now we are pissed and ready to crack their skulls. If you dip shits want this country, then come get it from my cold dead hands. I dare you ! Come on !!

        Outstanding site.      I will mention it in my next newsletter and post it to my links page. Good work.      You guys are doing great. There are those same assholes from the 60's stirring up anti-everything stuff. But you have a lot of support that does not get the press that the anti's get. Great job, you Marines make us old farts stand a little taller when we see what a job you're doing. Plainly put.......JUST FUCKIN' OUTSTANDING MARINE!!!

        A little over a year ago I started sending care packages to a U.S. Marine I adopted. I adopted him through    GySgt Lassiter    who were both stationed at Camp Fox, Kuwait.    Cpl Guerrerolopez    or know to his fellow Marines as    Cpl G-Lo   . After returning home from his first tour in Operation Iraqi Freedom    Cpl G-Lo    came to my house. I got a chance to meet him in person, I was able to shake his hand & thank him. Thank him for doing a job I could not do.   Cpl G-Lo   will never know how much I appreciate him going out of his way to visit me at home. In my opion I did nothing that important but send care packages, supplies &amp; letter of support.    Cpl   G-lo   &   GySgt Lassiter    along with all my adopted have done more for me then I can ever do for them. They are able to stand on alone &amp; defend the freedoms are great nation provide.    I THANK YOU Cpl G-lo !!    I'm honored to support you ! I feel privledge to be able to send you care packages & support letters. Thank you for staying in touch as long as you have sir. My trip out to Maryland was one of the best vacation trips I've gone on. Thenk you for inviting me out to Maryland so I could hang out w/ you &amp; your fellow Marines. God Bless !! God Speed you home safe    Cpl G-Lo    !!! :)  urlLink       GySgt Lassiter  ,   Cpl G-Lo    and all my other adopted Marines are Heroes !! I don't give a rat's ass what anyone else may say or think. They mean more to me then they'll ever know. I truly appreciate what those brave men do each &amp; every single day !! If I could trade my life to bring back one of their falling brothers, I would in a heart beat. If I could walk in their boots for just 5 minutes, so they may be able to see their loved ones. That would be a walk of honor !! Because of those men I am free today !! Thank you all for what you do !!! :)

It made my heart unhappy    To think that one so free    Could be unpatriotic    About our liberty.       No nation in the whole wide world    Can boast so fine a deeds    That we are doing daily,    To fill the world's needs.       America has won 1st place    As far as I can tell,    In sharing all the treasures,    And things we love so well.       Our nation's healed the    losers In war torn countries, too,    And helped build up democracy    That no one else would do.       America, America,    I love to hear your name,    Please light your patriotic fires    In all who love your flame,       And warm the hearts that wonder,    And doubt your worthiness,    That all may share your noble cause,    And every nation bless.

      U.S. Marines conducting house to house search in the Suni Triangle of Iraq. The Sunni Triangle is a hot bed for insurgents willing to do harm to U.S. forces in Iraq. The Alley ways are small tight and crap spaces. The U.S. Marine force has to be careful & quick to  urlLink   react in a heart beat. The insurgents are hard to spot at times, but the Marines are hell bound on hunting them down &amp; killing them all.   GIVE'EM HELL BOYS !!

      U.S.Marines in a alley shot out with insurgents somewhere in Afghanistan. A force of 2,000 Marines were droped into Afghanistan, to help the Army take out insurgents threating to harm America.   urlLink    The Army has a force of 18,000 troops or so in Afghanistan now. The 2,000 U.S. Marine force did more damage to the insurgents on their short tour, then the army has their whole time in Afghanistan.   WHAT DOES THAT TELL YA ABOUT THE ARMY ???
