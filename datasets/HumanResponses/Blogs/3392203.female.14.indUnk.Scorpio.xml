      You are the sweetest person ive ever known. I loved your last post so much! I love you so much! i cant believe its been 5 and a half months already. Our relashionship couldnt be better. Ya know. that ringtone is right. "Cuz im dreaming of you tonight. till tomorow, ill be holding you tight. And theres nowhere in the world id rather be. Then here in my room. Dreaming about you and me." I love that song. Its so true to. I dont need to see you everyday to be in love. Some of my friends say they could never keep a long-distance relationship going strong. But its not that hard when youve found someone as caring and as sweet as you. You're the perfect person for me, and i honestly dont know where i would be right now without you. I love you so much its undescribable. 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 yours always iRay

      Thanks for coming back on Wednesday. It meant alot to me that we spent time 2gether. I love you so much that words cant describe it. even numbers cant... summer school is gonna suck ass, but theres not much i can do about it now, is there? These past 5 months have been great, and i cant thank you egnough for making my life worth living when its been hell. I love you so much. ill call u when i get home 2morrow, k? (i dunno when that will b tho cuz i get 2 walk home from ms 2 my house, fun rite? lol) 143 iRay

      i love you so much! this movie got me thinking about everything.  Its about this couple, and starts with an old woman in a nursing home being read to by a man that also lives at the nursing home.  The woman has some kind of memory loss disease, and the man is there because he had 2 heart attacks.  The woman cant remember anything from her past life. and in reading the book to her, he is trying to bring her back. anyway... ill tell u more on the fone if u ask. I love u so much! and when you were asking me what i wanted for my birthday i honestly couldnt and still cant think of a better gift you could give me then to just visit me on my birthday.  If its possible, i want to spend that day with you. call me 2morrow... i kno ur already asleep. I love you and miss you so much, and when i was thinking about my future and how i wanted to live my life, i couldnt see it without you in the picture. I love you so much, and you have made everything ive gone through so much eaiser.  I love you so much. 143 --iRay p.s. this would be longer, but its kicking me off the cmp... (dont even waqnna think bout y...) love u
