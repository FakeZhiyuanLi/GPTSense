      Today I got to sleep in (hallelujah) til like 10.  Then i had to go eat lunch with the g-parents all the way out in the middle of nowhere in this like dump of a place where they had a barbeque bar thing.  make any sense?  It didn't to me.  So then i went to pick up concealer from clinique and i got a free gift (yay!).  Then i went to claires and got some matching earings and necklaces for my cousins and I.  After that it was off to Tarjay cuz i mean you can never leave for a trip without going to tarjay.  then i got my hair stuff and went home.  Well when i got home i checked out my makeup and it turns out that the clinique lady gave me the wrong shade of concealer.  I told my dad to go and exchange it cuz i had to babysit at 6 and i didn't have time to go myself.  I wrote him a note, layed the bag out on the counter and everything.  Well i get home and guess who didn't go to the store to exchange liz's concealer??  Mi Padre.  That's who.  So i guess i'll be buying concelaer in denver tomorrow.  Fun.  Well I got to see amez and hear all her wacky stories about L-ridge then i had to run home to leave to go babysit.  I swear that's like all i do now.  No job, no car, everyone's out of town.  Irmo just generally sucks right now.  So I leave for denver tomorrow.  You'd think, awsome, denver, great city to ski in.  Well i'm going in august so no skiing, and i'm visiting family.  Oh by the way, it's just me and my brother flying out by ourselves and I swear if i see one dude in a turban on my plane i'm getting the hell outa there.  No prejudice, just common sense people.  I really don't want to go.  I'll get back on the 8th and then school starts on the 9th.  Great timing.  I still have to get the rest of my school supplies, a bookbag, and some new clothes and shoes.  When am i gonna' have time????  Oh yeh, they've got stuff planned out too.  Like we're hiking and going to a water park and swimming and up to the mountains (i kinda' thought we were already in the mountains but i guess not) and all this stuff.  While that's great and all, and i sorta kinda like being outdoors, i'm telling you guys, i'm gonna' like pass out or something cuz unlike them, i'm outa' shape.  That's just the way it is.  So there better be some majorly hot guys up there cuz if there aren't i think i'm gonna' go crazy.  No lie.  I mean how would you like it if you got shipped out to like a different region of the country to be with your 9, 7, and 5 year old cousins?  You wouldn't.  Gosh.  And then schools starting soon and i haven't finished my requried book, and i still have to rent les mis cuz news flash people, i refuse to read another book.  And get this, everyone is gone the week i'm here and then i leave when everyone comes back.  So i'm just gonna' take advantage of having free roaming nationwide or whatever you call it and  just chat on the phone the whole time i'm gone.  oh yeh, and then there's this 3 hour time difference.  How nice is that?  My flight leaves at 12:30 and i arrive in denver at 1:30 or something, cept it'll feel like 4:30.  Nice.  No comprendo my schedule.  I swear, next summer is gonna' be crazy.  I've gotta do the msision trip thing, the partners program, somewhere in there i've gotta go on a family vacation, maybe a job, and all this other crap.  Oh guess what!?!  I was talking to my dad about going on a cruise and brining amez and hopefully/probably we'll get our own adjoining room which is off the chain and means that if we have a cerfew of like midnight, well come in, "go to sleep" and then leave again.  i mean how awsome is that.  I will have a muy bueno time.  Hehehehe.  Well mi madre and i got in a fight like yesterday i guess but before that we were in the car and she was yelling at me about how i dress.  My response was "well at least i'm not sleeping with people like just about everyone else i know".   That shut her up pretty quick.  So for once, we've come to an agreement.  Since i'm not having sex (yes i am a virgin and i'm proud of it)  she doesn't have any reason to yell at me about how i dress.  I'm liking this agreement.  Well that's about it people.  Maybe i'll run into some hot guy on the plane....haha-  well that's about it folks.  I'll talk to ya'll in a week!  Call if ya want.  I'm gonna go crazy out in denver.  Love ya!  Liz

      Okay...Today i helped out at registration and that was actually kinda fun b/c i got to see all the people in my grade for the first time since school got out.  Keah came to registration even though she just got her embedded wisdom teeth taken out yesterday without laughing gas i might add so props to keah for coming.  Shoot, i have to be put all the way under.  None of the shots in the mouth thing.  no me gusta.  So i got my schedule.  I don't love all my teachers, especially Mr. Lauzon for H-Bio.  It sucks major that i have him.  Supposedly he's a hard teacher, and a bad teacher which is just great considering i'm gonna' major in like pre-med or biology, so i'd like to have some kind of background but oh well.  I guess that's just not gonna' happen.  I also have someone named Stafford for Espanol tres.  I never heard of this person before but w/e.  Hopefully they'll be easy cuz i learned no spanish last year.  Gotta love mrs. carter...."no me gusta!"  So all the seniors, juniors, and almost all the sophmores register themselves and that's cool.  It's less people and less confusing for everyone.  Well, the freshman bring their moms, dads, grandparents, sisters, brothers, i mean everyone they know with them to registration.  What's up with that?  and then people yell at me about their screwed up schedules just cuz i'm sitting in front of a computer.  hello people, i hardly know what i'm doing.  So i nod and smile.  It usually works.  We got chick-fil-a for lunch for free.  That was awsome.  So here's my schedule:   A Day  1A) Fit/T-VB with Coach D 2A) Semester 1-Service learning with Tom Wise 2A) Semester 2-Photo 1 with Mrs. Long 3A) Spanish 3 with Stafford 4A) Alg.2 AD with Mrs. Frierson   B Day  5B) English 2 H with Mrs. Debenport 6B) World History 2 H with Mrs. Brock 7B) Biology 1 H with Mr. Loazon (ugh) 8B) Leadership with Mrs. Nye (yay!)  That's it.  Then after registration I went to Sally's beauty supply place to get pure acetone to take off my stupid fake nails which won't come off the normal way which is me just biting them off.  It was being a bitch and it took like 45 minutes for the suckers to dissolve off.  Ugh.  So I dunno if i'll ever get them again.  Then I went to like Office Depot over by Dutch Square Mall to get binders.  It cost 20 dollars just for my binders.  How gay is that?  Why can't they make cheap binders that don't break?  No comprendo.  Then I came home and got subway.  By the way, the new mediterranean chiken sub thing is awsome cuz they put tons of feta cheese on there which is the bomb.  Just to give ya'll the heads up.  Then I came home, watched some TV, the usual, then went to pick up mi hermano robert from ACX (it's gotta' be a middle school thing) and i ran into brooke and britt and sierra.  That was cool.  There's a full moon out tonight which is awsome and it reminded me of sleeping outside in SD.  So that's about it.  Tomorrow i'm supposed to go to my dad's office sometime and copy pictures from SD, then go to eat lunch with the grandparents then pack for Denver, then babysit til like 2 in the AM.  It should be fun.  Well i g2g cuz my fingers hurt.  Caio!  Liz

      Today I worked at registration.&nbsp; It was like a freezer in the cafeteria!&nbsp; Oh yeh, we have this $200,000 grant to remodel our cafeteria over the summer.&nbsp; Well, it looks the same to me.&nbsp; Oh...wait, that's cuz they haven't DONE anything yet.&nbsp; Apparently they're gonna' start something on the 5th which means they have like a week to get it done, so i'm guessing that nothings really going to change, and that just sucks.&nbsp; So it was like 20 degrees in the cafeteria.&nbsp; Whats up with that?&nbsp; Keah got her wisdom teeth out today so i got her a card (cuz i'm such a kind person).&nbsp; She was freaking out but then i would be too if they didn't put me all the way under.&nbsp; Then I got to go to tarjay after registration.&nbsp; Gotta' love tarjay.&nbsp; I could live in that store.&nbsp;   Then I went to Hallmark and got this cute little photo albulm for all my SD pictures.&nbsp; Then I came to church so that was fun.&nbsp; It was just a couple of us but it was cool.&nbsp; We just hung out and answered questions.&nbsp; Muy bueno.&nbsp; I've gotta get copies of Steven's and Allie's pictures on Saturday, and then get them to Allie's house by 5.&nbsp; Huhm...that should be fun cuz I gotta go to my g-parents sometime that day too, plus i babysit that night and i have to get my white jacketa from amez house.&nbsp; OMG, the greatest thing happened today.&nbsp; I owed IHS $153 for books i didn't loose, and guess what????? THEY FOUND THEM!!!! It's a miracle from God.&nbsp; So now all is good cuz i have enough money to go out and do stuff now.&nbsp; And not eat off of the Wendy's dollar menu so yay.&nbsp; Well for all you SD people, our get together is now officially the 9th of august around 6:00 at the church.&nbsp; Bring a desert and your pictures.&nbsp; The Shareholders dinner is on August 29 and it's $12 for anyone if you're not a Sonsray.&nbsp; Oh yeh, we're doing elections for fall planning council, so elect me and vote for me!&nbsp; Gracias.&nbsp; Well that's about it.&nbsp; Oh yeh, I got school supplies.&nbsp; that was fun.&nbsp; Who knew pens cost so much though? k gotta fly.  &nbsp; Liz

      I love summer because I have free time and hardly any extra cirricular activities.&nbsp; I hate summer because nothing sucks more than being bored all day long.&nbsp; Today I babysat for a few hours, then I came home, got online, read, and watched T.V.&nbsp; No one is home this week, they're all on vacation or out of town or something so it just generally sucks.&nbsp; I mean what am i supposed to do?&nbsp; Normally i'd be out with friends, and almost all of them can drive.&nbsp; Well, since they're all gone, and I can't drive, i have nowhere to go.&nbsp; I also don't have a job.&nbsp; I have got to get a job.&nbsp; Anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp; Well i'll be at IHS tomorrow helping everyone register for school.&nbsp; I haven't even finished my 2nd book yet.&nbsp; Well Amez got the lead in some play they're doing up at L-Ridge so yay for her.&nbsp; I get to go to church tomorrow, but i think no one will be there but that's okay, because I go for God (haha amez).&nbsp; Well thats all.&nbsp; Oh by the way, if any irmo people read this, tell me if you have any ideas about themes for field day and homecoming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh yeh, and if you have any ideas for our irmo vs. df t-shirt.&nbsp; adios  liz

      Today a lady from Carnival Cruise Line called my cell, and i hung up on her b/c i thought she was trying to sell me something.&nbsp; Well she called back and left a message telling me I had won something.&nbsp; I got my mom to call her back (seeing as how i hung up on her) and it turns out that if you're under 18 or 21 or something that you can't win stuff!&nbsp; How gay is that?&nbsp; Anyway, I was still happy because I did win (i don't even know what i "won") and i never win anything, EVER.&nbsp; So that was cool.&nbsp; Alright. bye!  liz

      POEM FOR YOUR WEEKMOMENTS IN LIFE By Author Unknown  There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real!  When the door of happiness closes, another opens; but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one, which has been opened for us.  Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile, because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile.  Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.  May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human and enough hope to make you happy.  The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.  The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past; you can't go forward in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.  When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. Live your life so at the end, you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.  Don't count the years-count the memories...........  Okay, I love this poem.&nbsp; Yeh, we've all heard some sort of this type of thing before, but they're still good to read and it makes you think.&nbsp;  "The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way." That's my favorite verse.&nbsp; Alright. that's all.  Liz

      I'm supposed to write a reflection of my experience in SD so they can be complied into a book or something and given to the congregation.&nbsp; It's actually pretty hard.&nbsp; I'm working on it though.&nbsp; For those of you who know what i'm talking about, that conversation me and jenn and amez had in the SD journal is now typed up and it is hilarious my friend.&nbsp; Amez and Jenn, check your email.&nbsp; Well I'm really bored today.&nbsp; I babysat, and I read my stupid summer reading books, and i'm starting to pack for Denver, and I practiced piano.&nbsp; That's all.&nbsp; God.&nbsp; I love the summer, but sometimes I hate it.&nbsp; Sometiems like now.&nbsp;

      All i'm doing this week is babysitting and helping out with registration.&nbsp; Fun huh?&nbsp; Yeah it sucks.&nbsp; Today I babysat Mr. Bill's awsome kids and tomorrow i'm babysitting Pam and Amy's kids, then Mr. Bill's kids again.&nbsp; On Wed. it's Mr. Bill's kids again, and then on Saturday i'm babysitting Amy's kids.&nbsp; I mean holy cow.&nbsp; Oh well, I've gotta' do it because I need the money.&nbsp; Yeah, I owe IHS $150 for books I never lost.&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp; Then on Thurs. and Fri. i've gotta be @ IHS from 9-4.&nbsp; We don't even get to leave for lunch.&nbsp; Then on Sunday I leave for Denver, CO. to see my cousins and family out there.&nbsp; It's just me and my brother flying so this should be fun.&nbsp; Everyone from church is in Virginia, and I wish I could be there too, but I can't b/c I went to Kure instead.&nbsp; That was a mistake, but I guess it's for the best, because i'd be one of like 5 girls on the trip, a few i cannot stand for a week.&nbsp; Amez is at L-ridge too.&nbsp;   So everyone gets back on like the day I leave for Denver.&nbsp; Talk about coincidence.&nbsp; Then I come back on the 8th, and it's so shitty, I might not even be able to make it to the picutre/video thing at Mr. Bill's that day.&nbsp; If i can't make it i will be permamently pissed at my Dad for making me even go to Denver.&nbsp; Allright, enough of my complaining (even though it's my journal so i can complain all i want :).&nbsp;   I found a cool quote in my gay ass summer reading book, cry the beloved country.&nbsp; Here it goes: *Because when a man loves, he seeks no power, therefore he has power* I thought that was cool.  Then there's my other new fave from the movie Bourne Supremacy (awsome movie, go see it): *You're in a deep puddle of shit, and you don't have the shoes for it!* Another awsome quote.  So it really sucks that everyone is gone and i'm here all alone, babysitting.&nbsp; and then i leave.&nbsp; when everyone comes back.&nbsp; No lie, like everyone and their mother is gone this week.&nbsp; I'm being punished for something I guess.&nbsp; Allright I g2g to bed.&nbsp; watching kids wears u out.&nbsp; Later.-  Liz

      I was a lector today, and a damn good one at that!&nbsp; I had all these hard words like abel-melhola, yet i still pronounced them correctly so yay for me.&nbsp; Today at church, i sat with steven, kirby, amez, and chesson.&nbsp; I don't think i even remember what the name of the sermon was because i didn't pay attention at all.&nbsp; Kirby proposed to steven, but sadly got turned down. :(&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; So after church I gotta look at Steven's pictures from SD and they were awsome so i've gotta borrow them sometime to make copies.&nbsp;   Then we went to my g-parents house in prosperity.&nbsp; it was loads of fun.&nbsp; not.&nbsp; I told my grandma about shrubbery.&nbsp; She thought it was hilarious.&nbsp; hahaha.&nbsp; Then I came home and watched tv and ate dinner and did all the boring everyday stuff then i got tired and took an hour long nap because last night i didn't go to sleep til 2:30 and then i woke up at 8:00.&nbsp; Not a fun thing to do.&nbsp; So everyone's going on the virginia trip tomorrow and i want to go too, but no can do because i went to kure.&nbsp; I'll go next year though.&nbsp;   The picutre thingy at mr. bill's house is on august 8 at 3:00.&nbsp; Well, my flight doesn't come in to charolette until like 4:50, then i have to drive from charolette to columbia so i don't think i'll be able to come at all which really pisses me off, so i'm trying to get my dad to get me an earlier flight.&nbsp; I hate the stupid airlines they're just dumb.&nbsp; I also hate being bored.&nbsp; I got home from my g-parents and i as so bored i was aobut to go crazy.&nbsp; I've GOT to do summer reading, but i keep on putting it off.&nbsp; I'm thiking maybe i should just say screw reading the book, bomb the test, and then work my ass off to pull my grade up.&nbsp; what do you think?&nbsp; Well that's all folks.&nbsp; g'nite-  Liz

      So..&nbsp; Today was a cool day.&nbsp; I was at Mr. Bill's new house which is huge (5,600 sq. ft. to be exact) to watch Kenny and Jillian while he and Marty and Jared moved stuff from old house to new house.&nbsp; No lie, the house has a basement which is like 1,300 sq. ft. all by itself.&nbsp; Anyway I was there til like 5 and it was cool cuz I got to talk to Reba about how worried we are about what's gonna' go down once Barbara's on maternity leave.&nbsp; You can never really tell with my church.&nbsp; We all flirt, that's normal, and no joke, just about everyone has dated someone within the youth group, and even though that's cool and all, we're just a lil worried about what's gonna' happen once barbara's gone b/c she's the strict one.&nbsp; Can you say, watch out for ski trip, 05'?&nbsp; haha reba.&nbsp; Also, i found out that Amez had to close down her live journal b/c she got bitched at for writing stuff in it about our youth group.&nbsp; News flash people, you don't have to read it.&nbsp; We write in journals because it's an outlet.&nbsp; So, they happen to be&nbsp;online and you're more than welcome to read them, but if you have un problema, keep it to yourself.&nbsp; That's about all I have to say on the subject.&nbsp; So tonight me and amez and magee went to see Bourne and it was an awsome movie (which is a plus since we only went to see the hot guy).&nbsp; Well we arrived at the theatre at 7:45 and the movie started at 8:00.&nbsp; well they were sold out.&nbsp; SOOOO we bought tickets for hte 9:45 showing and ate at Atlanta Bread.&nbsp; It was pretty good.&nbsp; We talked about youth group and how we love/hate it.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp; Then we walked down to Goody's and walked around in there for awhile and then we walked back.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure we looked like hookers on the street (rather I did) but that's ok.&nbsp; Then we saw the movie.&nbsp; Good movie, go see it.&nbsp; Anywho, tomorrow i'm gonna' be a lector at church for the first time ever. This is kinda' scary considering i can't pronounce like half of the words.&nbsp; It'll be ok though b/c steven the PIMP will be laughing at me in the congregation.&nbsp; haha- Liz&nbsp;

Anyway i yelled at her so it's okay now i guess.&nbsp; Ooohhhh guess what?&nbsp; I think my family is going on a cruise during spring break this year and my daddy said amez might be able to come.&nbsp; Me gusta b/c we will have soo much fun.&nbsp; Well that's about it.&nbsp; i gotta go see if Jared dropped off my pics.&nbsp; This could be scary, walking outside to my mailbox at 10:30.&nbsp; Well I gots to go cuz i'm off to Mr.Bill's tomorrow to help watch his kids.&nbsp; By the way, his house is off the chain!&nbsp; It's humungous!&nbsp; K that's all.&nbsp; Buenos noches!  liz

      So.&nbsp; Today was a muy bueno dia.&nbsp; I got to go shopping (yay!) and i got a bunch of back to school clothes and a new church dress.&nbsp; I also ran into the redfearns and a bunch of friends from school I haven't seen since May.&nbsp; That was pretty cool.&nbsp; Then I got to go to youth group which was awsome cuz i got to see some people that went on SD which i haven't seen in days, which feels really weird considering i practiclly lived with these people for 12 days.&nbsp; Then after youth group amez and me headed over to her place and waited for Michael to come pick us up.&nbsp; He came and got us, and then we headed over to Anchor Lanes to go bowling.&nbsp; Once we got there (around 9ish) we parked to wait for someone when Greg Moore pulls up.&nbsp; How the hell he found us, no one knows.&nbsp; All I know is absolutely everyone hates this guy, including me, so we decide to try and loose him.&nbsp; We drove all over the place, and just when we thought he would follow Nick into Quail Valley, he continues to tail us until we got to Rush's.&nbsp; Then Michael locked his keys in his car, so he had to get a ride to his house with Greg (poor michael) while me and amez rode with Nick back to go bowling.&nbsp; Well, as it turns out, Michael didn't really lock his keys in the car, he just pretended he did so we could loose Greg.&nbsp; Go Michael!&nbsp; It was an ingenious plan.&nbsp;  So we bowled.&nbsp; It was actually a lot of fun, even though i knew like 5 people. Oh by the way, i wore white shorts which glow under black light.&nbsp; A huge mistake considering everyone with a penis was staring at my ass.&nbsp; Also, I have fake nails on right now, so bowling is muy deficil.&nbsp; Other than that it was an awsome night.&nbsp; Amez has found a new friend.&nbsp; Haha, if you know what i mean.&nbsp; Well that's about it.&nbsp; I think we might be doing something Saturday night but who knows.&nbsp; Caio-   Liz

      You know the one thing i hate about summer?&nbsp; Summer reading.&nbsp; I mean it really sucks.&nbsp; I'm supposed to read cry the beloved country.&nbsp; Well, i sit down determined to start this stupid book, and once i get to chapter three, i'm asleep.&nbsp; Now thats when you know it's truly a bad book.&nbsp; Mi Madre made chiken quesadillas tonight.&nbsp; they were yummy.&nbsp; My dad is still trying to change my flight.&nbsp; It's being a real bitch though.&nbsp;   So all i really did today was sleep in, eat some real food, and watch tv ( i tried to read, but it just wasn't working out).&nbsp; Tonight i got to talk to some irmites who i haven't seen or talked to in ages it seems.&nbsp; It was really cool.&nbsp; It's funny talking to people who&nbsp;you've known since you were like 5.&nbsp; They knew you when you looked like a total idiot in elm. school, and they've seen you in your absolute best and worst times, yet they still love you anyway.&nbsp; So overall it was a pretty good day.&nbsp; Tomorrow i get to go shopping for a new dress for church because i'm a lector on sunday, and mi madre won't let me wear my other dress because my boobs grew and now i have crazy cleavage (which isn't that great of a thing might i add).&nbsp; And i've got to look for back to school clothes because i absolutely can't wear my shorts (aka my underwear) to school.&nbsp; Then i've got tursday nights at church which means yay for liz b/c i can get copies of pictures from people from the trip.&nbsp; Then me and amez are going to the bowling alley with some of her friends and hopefully they'll be some hot guys there.&nbsp; Well that's 'bout it guys.&nbsp; And oh yeh, one more thing.. In steven's words "Lets go back to South Dakota."&nbsp; Amen my friend- well i'm out.  Liz

      I'm back to normal and it feels good.&nbsp; So today i went to the orthodonist this morning and i'm gonna' get my two front teeth bonded.&nbsp; fun huh?&nbsp; After that me and amez and kayla decided to grab a late lunch (try 3:00) at O'Charleys and then go get our nails done.&nbsp; Well, this is a great idea and I had an awsome time cept for the fact that we all had to run across the street.&nbsp; The street i'm talking about is that one that goes between the target shopping center and the Michales/Petsmart shopping center.&nbsp; I almost got hit by a car, and we looked like absolute idiots but it was so much fun.&nbsp; What sucks is not have a car.&nbsp; no me gusta.&nbsp; I got tips put on my nails.&nbsp; they look pretty :)&nbsp; After we got our nails did, we went to targay to pick up la picutras from the SD trip.&nbsp; They're all really good, cept that I don't have any pictures of the people we met there, or where we stayed, so i'm gonna' need to borrow some other people's pictures and copy them.&nbsp; Then i came home and got to see my cousin Emily (she's 3) and that was cool b/c i never get to see her.&nbsp; She's spoiled rotten but she's such a sweety.&nbsp; &nbsp; My Dad's trying to change my flight date from August 1st to august 2nd or something so i can go to Mr.Bill's house on august 1st and we can do the whole swap pictures and pick out which ones we like thing.&nbsp; Apparnetly, it's hard to change flights.&nbsp; This i did not know.&nbsp; Anyway, I found two really cool quotes today.&nbsp; One I stole from amez who stole it from the new movie I, Robot :*sneeze* sorry i'm allergic to bullshit.&nbsp; I thought that was pretty funny.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; The next one i got from watching dawson's creek (I know, it's such an old show, and no one watches it but i like it.&nbsp; what can i say, i'm justa *dork*): "If you can feel comforatable not knowing...you can learn anytyhing, anything; and if not, well then you've stopped before you've begun".&nbsp; I thought it was kinda' neat.&nbsp; Anywayz that's all for tonight folks.&nbsp; Caio- &nbsp; Liz

      Sun. July 18, 2004 &nbsp; This morning I was supposed to wake up at 5:00 to take the first shower.&nbsp; Well, my alarm went off, and I got up, but then i went back to sleep and didn't get up until 6:00 so me and Amez had to take a shower together w/ bathing suits on, and hurry to get ready.&nbsp; Once we were ready by 7:15, we waited til 8:00 for church to start.&nbsp; This was a lutheran church, so we knew how the service went, but i've never sang a hymn so fast!!&nbsp; The pianist couldnt' have played them faster!&nbsp; And the assistant pastor person reminded me of the guy from Office Space with the stapler, and he had a lisp.&nbsp; And the sermon was 32 minutes long.&nbsp; Amez timed it.&nbsp; -lol-&nbsp; Then we took at picture out in front of the sign thingy, and we were off to SC.&nbsp; &nbsp; We had a great time in the car though, because we all just talked and gossiped.&nbsp; Stains and Blankets.&nbsp; OCD girlfriends.&nbsp; -lol- Once we got in SC though, and we said hey to our parents and stuff, we prayed in a circle.&nbsp; Me and Jenn started crying.&nbsp; I feel like these people are my family.&nbsp; I really do.&nbsp; And I started missing them as soon as I said I wasn't gonna' cry.&nbsp; And by the way, I hardly ever cry.&nbsp; I miss them, I really do.&nbsp; We all hugged, and then took some pictures, and we left.&nbsp; I cried all the way home, and when I was home, I wouldn't talk to anyone about the trip, and i started putting this journal up.&nbsp; Hopefully someone will read it and think it's cool.&nbsp; If not, it's okay because it's an outlet for me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I think my Dad thinks i'm mad at him or something, because he kept asking me about the trip, and I kept cyring and wishing I was with everyone.&nbsp; You know how they tell you Mission trips change your life, and you know it's true, but you never believe it?&nbsp; Well I believe it now.&nbsp; I honsetly think this has changed my life.&nbsp; And I think i'm the only person out of the whole trip who would have liked to have not come home.&nbsp; I could honestly do this for a living.&nbsp; I've always wanted to be a pediatric neurologist, but I think I could do stuff with youth groups too.&nbsp; Well I g2g.&nbsp; Night ya'll. &nbsp; Liz

      Sat. July 17, 2004 &nbsp; Today we left the church in Omaha, Nebraska and drove 14 hours to get to Nashville, TN.&nbsp; Well, apparently you're supposed to go from Nebraska to Illinois, then to Kentucky, then to Tennessee.&nbsp; Well, we went from Nebraska to Kansas, then to Illinois, then to Kentucky, then to Tennesse. We arrived in Nashville at the church at like 10:45 or something.&nbsp; They had a sign out front that said "Welcome Redeemer Lutheran&nbsp; Youth".&nbsp; It was really cool.&nbsp; Then we had devotions and went to bed.&nbsp; G'Night. &nbsp; Liz

      Fri. July 16, 2004 &nbsp; Today we left Shetek, and we're headed for Omaha, Nebraska.&nbsp; It was hard saying goodbye, because it felt like as soon as you got to know everyone, you had to leave.&nbsp; That&nbsp; part really sucked.&nbsp; All us Redeemer kids got a group picture in front of the Shetek sign.&nbsp; It'll probably be really good.&nbsp; All of us girls got up at 4:30 this morning to take warm showers, blow dry our hair, put on makeup, and dress up cute and pack.&nbsp; Well, we couldn't blow dry our hair by the mirrors because we couldn't wake anyone up, so we went into the kitchen.&nbsp; Well, Jenn and I started drying our hair for like 20 seconds when a fuse went out.&nbsp; Then we switched outlets, and I finished drying my hair, and so did Jenn, and then the fuse blew out again on Candace.&nbsp; It sucked, and we couldn't fix it, or tell anyone because it was like 5:00 in the morning.&nbsp; Then we found more outlets and finished.&nbsp; Someone must have fixed the fuse thingy because we had light in the ktichen by breakfast. &nbsp; After that we did our makeup (in the dark) and that was a different experience and packed in the dark.&nbsp; Then we got dressed and ate breakfast.&nbsp; After that we had Wisdom of the Elders, and then it was time to leave.&nbsp; We all said good-bye for like 30 minutes, and then took our picutres and left.&nbsp; Then we drove to Omaha.&nbsp; Once we got there we were assuming we were meeting their youth group (that was why we got all cute looking) and the lady told us they weren't coming.&nbsp; It was kinda&nbsp;a let down but it was allright.&nbsp; Then we just went on walks and talked and stuff.&nbsp; It was pretty cool.&nbsp;  &nbsp; After that, Me, Amez, Nicki, Mr. Bill, Joel, and Candace went to Wal-Mart.&nbsp; I spent 20 dollars on Propel water and magazines and fruit snacks.&nbsp; -lol-&nbsp; Then we went to look for a bookstore and almost got lost.&nbsp; On the way home, we were all talking about Bertha, and we got so caught up and mad that someone made a rule that if you didn't have the water bottle, you couldn't talk.&nbsp; So when Nicki was talking, she goes "i'm sorry to be blunt, but i've been dying not being able to tell anyone, so here it goes..." and she goes "when we got to our bunks, i climbed up top, and as i was sitting up there i hear Bertha say something like i've roomed with girls before, so we all have the same parts, so nicki looks over and sees her butt nacked, and then Nicki goes, Whoaa,, I don't even know you name yet!&nbsp; and then she tells all of us that apparently bertah doesn't believe in shaving south of the belly button, and that she looks like a jungle.&nbsp; Then joel goes, "it's like an ingrown fro".&nbsp; Then Nicki goes "it looks like shurbbery!"&nbsp; Mr. Bill was about to die from laughing so hard.&nbsp; Anyway, once we got back to the church, we all play fought with Twizzlers which hurt really hard if you get popped with them by the way.&nbsp; Then we went to bed.&nbsp; The End. &nbsp; Liz

      Thurs. July 15, 2004 &nbsp; So, today was the last day.&nbsp; It was really cool because we actually had free time.&nbsp; From 2:30 to 5:00 we had to clean Shelem and Kiksuya.&nbsp; We had a massive breakfast this morning too.&nbsp; After that we set up bunk beds.&nbsp; The 1st house smelled so bad taht i thought I was gonna' pass out/throw up.&nbsp; It have no idea how they live there.&nbsp; We had to move the couch in the den so that&nbsp;the bunk-bed could go by the door.&nbsp; They didn't even have a room to sleep in.&nbsp; Then after that we went to another house, and I could breathe in that one.&nbsp; After that we went to Bettes Kithcen.&nbsp; We got there an hour before we were supposed to be there, so we just played mrs. mary mack like little kids.&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; Then we went back and cleaned up Shetek, and signed everyones shirts.&nbsp; Then we went to a park to eat pizza, but we couldn't say because our leader person Cody thought that the risk of West Nile Virus was too great, so we went back to Shetek, and ate there.&nbsp; Then we listened to a guy named Kelly speak.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was really cool.&nbsp; Then we all danced around the medicine circle.&nbsp; After that I decided not to take a shower at night like i normally do and to take one in the morning (at 4:30) to be exact instead.&nbsp; So i got to stay out with everyone later and talk and we lsitened to Alex Michael play guitar.&nbsp; He's been playing for about 5 years, and he's absolutely amazing.&nbsp; He can play Jimmy Hendrix, Dave Matthew, anything you name, he can play.&nbsp; It was really inspiring, and since I already know all the chords from piano, I've decided to learn to play guitar.&nbsp; I'm so excited too.&nbsp; Well, then Jesse played some songs, and we sang, and then we went to bed.&nbsp; So adios mis amigos. &nbsp; Liz

      Wed. July 14, 2004 &nbsp; Today my group stained stuff (me, Amez, Bertha, Steven, Celeste, and Mazzei (sp?).&nbsp; While we were staining stuff, we sang songs.&nbsp; Rather we sang rap songs and listened to music out loud for the first time in days.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; Then we all came back and ate lunch, and went and hiked 3 miles in the Bad Lands &nbsp; While we were there, Me, Kansas, Joel, Kirby, Celeste, and some other people I don't know climbed up a hill/mound thing.&nbsp; It was so cool.&nbsp; Then Bertha fell down like 15 feet from thsi perch thing so now she's all scratched up.&nbsp; Then we ate at a food place.&nbsp; It was Indian Taco's again, and they were pretty good.&nbsp; Then once we got back we got to listen to Will Peters. &nbsp; Will Peters (his white man name) is an amazing man.&nbsp; He was so cool and inspiring.&nbsp; He talked about how Christopher Columbus was a rapist, molestor, and how he used to cut off the breasts of women so they couldn't feed their babies and watch them die.&nbsp; He also used to give the elderly and young Indians blankets that had the small pox virus in it, without telling them so they would die.&nbsp; He would order indians to bring him gold, and when they brought him the gold, he thought they had more even though they didn't, so he cut their hands off.&nbsp; He molested children, and raped women. &nbsp; Then he talked about Wounded Knee.&nbsp; Our soilders surrounded the camp site, and killed everyone.&nbsp; Men, Women, Children, you name it, they killed it.&nbsp; The little indian boys would be hiding in a bush, and the soilders would call them out and say "hey little boys, we won't hut you" and would then shoot them.&nbsp; They took babies, threw them up in the air and shot them.&nbsp; After everyone was dead, they left them in the snow to rot.&nbsp; One little baby who survived (lost bird) went onto become a prostitute and died in her 20's.&nbsp; It was so sad to hear the story.&nbsp;  &nbsp; He also talked about being a bonefide man, and how women are the greatest.&nbsp; He was basically male bashing, but since I'm a girl, I thought it was really cool.&nbsp; Then he talked about how everyone becomes alcoholics, and how they'res no where for them to go.&nbsp; There are no rehab centers, no place to work.&nbsp; The unemployment rate is 87%, and they can't get a job, so they have no food, so they drink because they have no self-esteem and they're depressed, and then they beat their wives, and molest their kids.&nbsp; It's a cycle, and there's no quick fix.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Then he talked about how we are all related, the red people, black people, white people, and yellow people.&nbsp; He also talked about the turtle and how it represents fertility.&nbsp; At the end of his speech, we all bought turtle necklaces.&nbsp; Mine is black and white and I think it's the best 20 dollars I've ever spent.  &nbsp; That night, we were all gonna' sleep outside together, but Barbara wouldn't let the poeple who had already slept outside sleep outside again.&nbsp; How gay is that?&nbsp; And we have no free time, so it's hard to get to know everyone.&nbsp; We have people here from SC (us), Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Conneticut.&nbsp; It's awsome.&nbsp; Then after that, Me, Kirby, Steven, Joel, Celeste, and Diana listened to Kirbys sex talk.&nbsp; It wasn't as good as the original one but it was pretty cool.&nbsp; Oh yeh, Bertha's a liar.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; The End.&nbsp; ANd by the way, I HATE liars.&nbsp; Buenos Noches. &nbsp; Liz

      Tues. July 13, 2004 &nbsp; Today we did a blitz in Wambli.&nbsp; i stained the bunk-beds with Celeste, Allie, Joel, Derket, and Mazzei (sp?).&nbsp; It was a lot of fun.&nbsp; It was a 70 mile ride there, so we just talked the whole way there.&nbsp; Once we were done, we ate lunch at the blitz site.&nbsp; It was indian tacos, which are delicious, and we didn't know until after we ate them that they were actually buffalo meat.&nbsp; Then we got to see 2 dogs going at it.&nbsp; It was so funny.&nbsp; When they go at it, the guy swells to they have to uh, wait until he "unswells" himself to get unhooked.&nbsp; It was hilarious to watch.&nbsp; The girl dog just dragged him around for like 2o minutes.&nbsp; Then a little kid tried to kick them apart, and we all got mad at him, because that's just cruel.&nbsp; We watched this for like 45 minutes.&nbsp; Then we drove to the trading post.&nbsp; Well that's like an hour and a half ride, and I had to pee so bad I didn't know what to do.&nbsp; After we left the trading post we went to Oglala college.&nbsp; Rather we rode by it.  &nbsp;  On the way back to Shelem, we sang Colors of the Wind (me, Joel, and Allie).&nbsp; We also did the hand motions which are by the way, off the chain.&nbsp; Then everyone else joined in with a bunch of other disney songs.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; Then later that night after dinner, a huge storm started up.&nbsp; So Celeste, Me, Jenny, Joel, and 2 other adults went up to the top of the hill to look.&nbsp; It was a huge thunderstorm with no rain.&nbsp; It was crazy.&nbsp; We all got cacti in our shoes, but it was so worth it.&nbsp; I've never seen anything like it before.&nbsp; Then we went back to Kiksuya and sang songs, and went to bed.  &nbsp;  Liz

      Mon. July 12, 2004 &nbsp; Today I set up bunk-beds with Jesse, Julliet, Kelsie (sp?), Kansas, and Reba.&nbsp; It shocked me to see how the Indians live.&nbsp; The homes were tiny, dirty, smelly, but they were still happy people, and they were grateful and shared popsicles (yum!) with us.&nbsp; I loved meeting all the kids there.&nbsp; One of the little girl's name was Arie.&nbsp; (Air-E).&nbsp; How precious is that?&nbsp;  &nbsp; After we got back, we all ate lunch, and then when Joel was taking a nap, Allie, Me, Steven, and Kirby decided to put shaving cream on his face.&nbsp; It was actually all Steven and Kirby's idea, but they were too chicken to actually do it, so I had to.&nbsp; Well, I sprayed the shaving cream on his face, and then he woke up, and I thought that he was gonna' wash it off, so we all ran back to Shelem, and while i was running, I look behind me and there he was.&nbsp; I don't think i've run that fast in my life.&nbsp; We made it to Shelem, and i went in the bathroom.&nbsp; When i&nbsp; finally came out and was washing my hands, Joel runs up behind me and gets peanut butter all over my face, neck, and hair.&nbsp; But it was okay, b/c i got him first, so we made a pact not to prank eachother anymore.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Like 10 minutes after that, we all got in the Re-member busses and were off to tour Pine Ridge Indian Reservation,&nbsp; the Red Cloud cemetary, a catholic church/school,&nbsp; and a museum.&nbsp; All the while, Bertha was telling us stories.&nbsp; Well, she said they were true, but they weren't.&nbsp; She said she fell in love with a boy that was 2 years younger than her, and she didn't find out until they were almost married.&nbsp; She also told us that her grandma offered her 1 million dollars to get married when she was 18.&nbsp; I do not like Bertha.&nbsp; Yeh, and then when we were on the bus, Joel's eyes were all screwed up so he was not in a very good mood, and then Derket (sp?) put sunscreen in his hair.&nbsp; It was sooo funny.&nbsp; When we got back to Shetek, we had dinner, Roses and Thorns, and Bible Study.&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Loadholt decided we should have bible study on the top of the little mountain/hill thingy.&nbsp; Well, there are tons of cacti, and other creatures living on that stuff, so I got a cactus stuck in my butt when I sat down.&nbsp; Needless to say, Liz was not a very happy camper.&nbsp; After that we all took showers (very cold i might add) and sang songs and went to bed.&nbsp;  &nbsp; liz

      Sun. July 11, 2004 &nbsp; Today we went to the Wounded Knee cemetary.&nbsp; It was very moving and sada t the same time.&nbsp; The Wounded Knee Massacre part of the cemetary was a mass grave with one enormous grave stone.&nbsp; I also saw a grave of a baby that only lived to be a week old.&nbsp; We had communion once we got to Wounded Knee with grahm-crackers and apple juice.&nbsp; It was really neat.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Later we erected a tipi, which was very cool.&nbsp; I even carried one of the like 15 foot poles by myself!!(minus that it took me like 10 minutes to carry it like 5 feet).&nbsp; Then once it was set up, we all got pictures in it, and sat in it.&nbsp; It was just very neat to be able to see an actual tipi.&nbsp; The Indian women were the ones who used to set up the tipi's all by themselves, in only 10 minutes!&nbsp; How cool is that.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Soon after that, a huge storm came in.&nbsp; It knocked over the tipi while Jesse (aka, Mr. Timberlake) and Tyler (aka, Harry Potter) were under it!&nbsp; But they're okay, which is good.&nbsp; Then we played this game, I can't remember what it's called, but it's really cool on the top of the hill while it was hailing.&nbsp; Then a beautiful rainbow came, and then there were two.&nbsp; It was gorgeous.&nbsp; It was so cool being on top of the hill, because you can see for miles it seems, and it's all silent.&nbsp; I never realized how loud it is where we live.&nbsp;  &nbsp; That night, we all slept outside.&nbsp; It was so peaceful, and I saw 8 shooting stars, and I've never seen a shooting star before so that was amazing in itself.&nbsp; I also saw the Big Dipper.&nbsp; I've never seen the big dipper before either.&nbsp; I had fun, but i felt a little left out, but that's okay.&nbsp; I did overhear Bertha telling some of her made up stories.&nbsp; I swear that child is a pathological liar.&nbsp; Oh yeh, the wind HOWLS out there!&nbsp; No lie.&nbsp; Plus it was cold.&nbsp; And I had a rock under my butt the whole night, but it was so worth it.&nbsp; But enough complaining.&nbsp; WHAAA.&nbsp; -lol-&nbsp; Oh yeh, the sun woke us up too.&nbsp; How cool is that?&nbsp; Well adios amigos. &nbsp; Liz

      Sat. July 10, 2004  &nbsp;  So, I don't open up to people.&nbsp; I let this being called a slut thing build up until I freak out, and then everyone's like "you're blowing this way out of proportion." when i'm actually not, it's just the first time i've said anything about it.&nbsp; And actually, i'm glad it happened.&nbsp; I needed everyone to know that it's not cool to call me a slut or to tease me because even though I laugh the jokes off, they still hurt.&nbsp; And sometimes, every now and then I just need a hug and for someone to listen to me.&nbsp; Is that too much to ask?&nbsp; I really don't think so.&nbsp; And I need to learn to open up.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm an extrovert, so i have plenty of friends, and if I ever need someone to talk to, I have plenty of people to choose from, but there's this side of me that i don't let anyone see, because it makes me vulnerable.&nbsp; I think my one ultimate fear is getting hurt, so if i'm vulnerable i can get hurt, and i'll do just about anything to avoid getting hurt.&nbsp; I don't even really know why I have such a fear of getting hurt either.&nbsp; Maybe it's because of my Mom and me never really having a relationship like other mom's and daughters, or maybe I'll never really know.&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I do know is that if i keep on being scared of getting hurt, i'll never get anywhere, and i'll always be alone.&nbsp; Now that's scary.&nbsp; Being alone.&nbsp; That's all for tonight folks.&nbsp; Too tired for anymore.  &nbsp;  Liz

      This is my favorite song.   &nbsp;  Iris   The Goo Goo Dolls  &nbsp; And I'd give up forever to touch you 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't want to go home right now   And all I can taste is this moment And all I can breathe is your life 'Cause sooner or later it's over I just don't want to miss you tonight   And I don't want the world to see me' Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am   And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive   And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am   And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am   And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am   I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I&nbsp;just want you to know who I am

      Fri. July 9, 2004 &nbsp; Today all us girls got up early and got all cute, piled into the vans and rode to the Bad Lands.&nbsp; Let me tell you something about the Bad Lands.&nbsp; They're very scary.&nbsp; There are these tiny little ledges that you're supposed to cross to get to a big ledge.&nbsp; Well i was about to cross one when I looked down and realized that I was like 200 feet up in the air, and I am not about to screw up my 300 thousand dollar back.&nbsp; No ma'am.&nbsp; So i freaked out and sat down right where I was.&nbsp; I honestly felt like Simba in the Lion King when Mufasa fell to his death.&nbsp; Then Allie slipped and almost fell.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well that freaked the shit out of me.&nbsp; Then after that we went to Wall Drug.&nbsp; &nbsp; Wall Drug is a sad little town.&nbsp; If you'd even call it a town.&nbsp; There were just a bunch of shops.&nbsp; We went to get shakes, and they told us they only had hard ice cream, so we asked for a hat (those disposable Krispe Kreme kind) and they told us if they gave them away, they'd get fired.&nbsp; That was a lie, i mean how far do i have to pull my shirt down to get a freakin' hat?&nbsp; Seriously people!&nbsp; The guy there must have been gay.&nbsp; Then Me, Allie, Joel, Kirby, Amez, and Steven were gonna' take an old timey photo but we didn't have time.&nbsp; It would have been soo cool though.&nbsp;  &nbsp; When we got to the church, it was so cool.&nbsp; I've never seen a cooler church.&nbsp; Because we're up north now, (the midwest rather)&nbsp; there are way more Lutherans, so their church has more members, therefore is nicer.&nbsp; I busted out the Charlie Brown song on the piano.&nbsp; -lol- It was fun. &nbsp; Then tonight we got in un argumento.&nbsp; After devotions&nbsp; and after we got to the church (which by the way was off the chain) Barbara and Nan pulled all the girls over to talk.&nbsp; I hate talks.&nbsp; They talked about how we dressed (aka, how I dressed) and then Nan calls Amez out and says (Amy, i've witnessed you rubbing up against guys).&nbsp; Well I freaked.&nbsp; I told Nan that it was not fair to call Amez out like that, and that she was not rubbing up against guys, and she doesn't even know us.&nbsp; Then Reba told me that I shouldnt' dissrespect the pastors wife like that.&nbsp; Well frankly I don't give a damn who she is, it doesn't give her the right to call someone out like that.&nbsp; Oh, and it really hurts my feelings that me and Amez are like the sluts of the church.&nbsp; They've even&nbsp; nick-named her the TDH, the team ho, and a bunch of other stuff.&nbsp; Barbara calls me out all the time on what I wear, just because i'm a D cup.&nbsp; Big deal.&nbsp; I can't hide the boobs.&nbsp; God gave them to me, i mean what do you want me to do about them? &nbsp; Well after that, I started crying and ran to the bathroom.&nbsp; Then Jenn came in and freaked out, because I never cry.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; and then Amez came in and Jenn left and we started balling, because it wasn't just this argument that got us rilled up, it was everything over the past year for me, and the past 2 years for her.&nbsp; Then barbara came in and talked to us until like 3 in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were screaming.&nbsp; Everyone was worried, and no one went to sleep.&nbsp; I seriously considered going home.&nbsp; After we calmed down enough to come out of the bathroom, we got our mattress and things from the girls room, and slept in the fellowship hall.&nbsp; It was a long night, and no one understands, and there's this weird untalked about silence.&nbsp; I hope it'll get better.&nbsp; Well, I gotta get some sleep so my eyes will stop swelling.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Liz

      Thurs. July 8, 2004 &nbsp; So, tonight we're in SD!!&nbsp; Hallelujah!&nbsp; I'm really tired,&nbsp; I didn't realize how long 14 hours really is.&nbsp; If you want to know, it's really long.&nbsp; Well, we're staying in Augustana College tonight in Sioux Falls, SD.&nbsp; We have dorms and stuff, it's pretty cool, except for the fact that no guys can come on our floor and no girls can come on the guys floor.&nbsp; Oh well, we'll live.&nbsp; The 2 guys checking us in we're most definately gay.&nbsp; Me and Amez are rooming togheter.&nbsp; It's cool.&nbsp; But what's not cool is having to take a crap in a restroom that's not your own.&nbsp; I guess I'll have to get used to it though, because i'm gonna' be gone for a while.&nbsp;  &nbsp; We're all getting up early tomorrow to look cute and stuff (aka, take showers, blow dry and curl hair, put on makeup and cute clothes) because we're going to the Bad Lands (it's like a canyon kinda' thing, i think...) and we're going to Wall Drug (some kinda' town that has been on every billboard for the last 6 hours).&nbsp; Well that's about it.&nbsp; Night kids. &nbsp; Liz

      Wed. July 7, 2004  &nbsp;  So, tonight we're in Illinois.&nbsp; I'm not sure where exactly, but they have a really weird water tower right outside of the church we're staying at that is blue and looks exactly like a butt crack!&nbsp; How crazy is that?&nbsp; Well, we ate dinner tonight at Applebee's.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; Joel and Kirby were hitting ont he waitress/hostess lady.&nbsp; It was absolutely hilarious.&nbsp; I think this is gonna' be a pretty cool trip.&nbsp; My van is awsome.&nbsp; We've got me, Jenn, Amez, Allie, Kirby, Joel, Steven, and Michael.&nbsp; Mrs. Nan and Rion are driving.&nbsp; I don't really know Rion that well, but he seems to be pretty cool.&nbsp; We're stopping at a college tomorrow night so yay!&nbsp; I'll be able to shower (there aren't any showers at the church we're staying at tonight).&nbsp; It's crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to bed at like 1:30 last night because I was still packing, and then i got up at 4:45 to finish packing and then get ready.&nbsp; Now it's like 1:00 in the morning (our time) and i'm STILL NOT TIRED!!!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  A small group of us (rather, our van minus Michael, aka Ashley)&nbsp;got a talking to from Mrs. Nan about playing around and being, uh oh.. sexual.&nbsp; How gay is that?&nbsp; All we were doing was running around outside, and i think Steven had his shirt off.&nbsp; Big deal.&nbsp; Do you have any idea how many butts I see from these people?&nbsp; -lol-.&nbsp; Oh, and then Allie was showing us how she can take her underwear off without taking off her shorts, and Mrs. Nan yelled at her for that too, and then she was picking lint out of Steven's belly button, and Mrs. Nan said that was innappropriate too.&nbsp; I do not want her on this trip.&nbsp; She grew up in like Prosperity, with all brothers on a farm, got married (Only God knows how) and had 2 boys, so she's never been around regular kids, let alone teenage kids, especially girls, so she has no idea how to handle us.&nbsp; It's just gay that she's here.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, I&nbsp;definately have the biggest and heaviest suitcase out of everyone here.&nbsp; Oh&nbsp;well.&nbsp; You could&nbsp;probably fit&nbsp;me in there if i curled up tight enough.&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp; I really like our total group,&nbsp;but right now our vans are&nbsp;kinda' seperated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully that'll change though.&nbsp; One thing that is really cool is that there are no couples on this trip, which is awsome because it cuts out on the&nbsp;dramarama.&nbsp; We played spoons tonight with cups (we&nbsp;couldn't find plastic spoons and weren't about to use metal ones).&nbsp; Well, I'm about to go to bed b/c i'm bored, plus&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel really weird&nbsp;writing in this journal&nbsp;because i've never had a journal before.&nbsp; Plus, we have to drive like 14 hours tomorrow.&nbsp; FUN!&nbsp; Well, only 2 more days until we see the engines.!&nbsp; Buenos Noches. &nbsp; Liz &nbsp;  Liz

      So...I'm in denver ya'll.  My flight from Char. to Denver got delayed like an hour and a half but it was cool cuz i got starbucks :)  So, let me tell ya about my flight.  First of all, mi hermano y yo had to wear these red lanyards with UM on them.  It stands for unnaccompianied minor.  I felt so retarted wearing it but what can ya do.  Oh!  I didn't make the alarm go off!  It was awsome.  So i got on the flight and my little brother sits in front of me.  I have some chinese guy yapping on his cell phone in chinese (the worst language in the world.  It's so harsh sounding!) for like the entire flight to the left of me, and then there was this girl who was engaged but looked like she should be in the 6th grade sitting to the left of me.  No one talked.  No one was friendly, but good news people!  No people in turbans.  Hallelujah right Ted?  So the seats on the plane are scratchy.  I would know this because i wore a skirt with a thong so literally my entire ass was on this scratchy seat for 3 hours.  No me gusta US airlines.  So we finally got there.  Oh yeh, they don't feed you on planes anymore!  You have to pay for your food!  How gay is that?   So i'm in denver now.  It's pretty cool i guess, minus the whole not knowing anyone but my relatives.  I mean i love my three cousins, but how much can you do with a 9, 8, and 5 year old?  Tomorrow we're going on a 14 mile bike ride.  Of course, my aunt runs 18 miles every morning cuz she's training for some marathon.  I swear, i think i'm gonna' die!  The time change is kinda' screwing me up, i gained two hours coming here but what's new.  I'll loose two hours coming back and that'll really suck.   Britt had this thing on her profile so I'm stealing it from her (gracias!) and it's awsome.  It's got a ton of cool quotes in it and it's called an interview with God, and it's not gay like a ton of these things you see on peoples profiles so heres the link:  urlLink http://www.theinterviewwithgod.com/popup-frame.html  Check it out.  It's muy bueno.  Well i don't really know what's up with me right now, but have you ever felt like everyone knows you, but they don't know the real you?   That's about how i feel right now, more or less.  It's a weird feeling. (sorry this is so random guys, just clearing my mind)  It's crazy, and it's kinda hard to explain.  It feels like I want to open up to people, and be myself, but i'm too scared to.  And the weirdest part is, I can't decide what scares me more; not opening up to anyone and then having no one know the real me, or opening up to people, but then getting hurt.  I hate getting hurt.  I know no one likes getting hurt, but i avoid it at all costs.  WHY IS THAT????  God, how can anyone begin to understand me when i can't even understand myself??  No comprendo.  It's like i feel all alone, all the time, even though i'm not.  It's the wrost feeling in the world, i do believe.  I mean it's not like i'm depressed or psychotic or anything, it's jus that sometimes i don't feel so great, even though i might not show it.   So i guess everything's good at home cept for this tropical storm thing that's going on.  What's up with that?  Hey all you SD ppl, what are you doing for your reflection?  I'm a little lost on what i'm gonna write so any help would be much appreciated.  So I found a really great quote today, here it goes: *You can't make anyone love you--all you can do is let yourself be loved* I believe that would be my new favorite quote.  So i'm out here in Denver, the only true southerner and ppl look at me soo funny when i say ya'll, which only encourages me to say it more.  haha.  Well I hope everything's going good at home with everyone.  Apparently some people might be mad at me for some gay ass reason but you know what?  I frankly don't give a damn.  Well That's it people!  Love yall.  Liz
