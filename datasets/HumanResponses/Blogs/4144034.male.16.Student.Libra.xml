        Oh, beautiful. Simply beautiful. I was just informed that i've been banned at TFN again. Why, you ask? I said the "forbidden word" in the same sentence with "damn". GOD DAMN sweetheart, hate me forever. What's the point in a society where you're censored because you might offend Christoholics? If you're a Jesus freak, you don't belong at TFN anyway. And who was the "god fearing" culprit in this case? Oh ho ho, no more than the infamous Strilo. The one and only oddball on TFN who would happily ban me anyday. He's also the one that just had to insert himself in on my last banning and lied completely to me. I don't want to get into details in that arena, but the fella really pissed me off period. Oh, what's the deal here?  Is he keeping a watch on my posts looking for a chance to ban me? Hmmm, i'd like to give him some credit but frankly i don't owe that bastard anything. I'd still be in a perma-ban right now if it wasn't for the help of Kimball_Kinnison from TFN. Without him, i'd be pretty much screwed. I don't know much, but from what i do know he defended me untill he made sure i wouldn't be permabanned. Due to Strilo's sick intentions, he knocked off a month of my last ban so i wouldn't get some of the heat for that. A sidetrack for that was that on my next ban, there would be another month knocked on. Under the circumstances, one slightly might think Strilo might want me to get banned, doesen't one? He has perfect motive to...and hell, he's ever the opporotunist. I can give him that. Beautiful. Simply beautiful.  Well, either way i guess that means i'm banned for at least 1 month and 24 hours. That son of a bitch. I can't go back to Kinnison asking for help this time...i doubt he'll take any more bullets for me. I  don't  want to break our agreement. I don't even think i got out of line by saying "god damn"...but i can't...i can't go back to him asking for more help. Whatever my banning is...i guess i'll have to take it as it comes. No matter how dumbass it is.  What will i do for the next month? Well, i might do some posting over at  urlLink KillBill2.Net  and my favorite art community on the internet,  urlLink deviantART . It sucks donkey balls that i was banned for this when others can simply get away with saying "i'd bang her like a screen door" in the JCC, but pricks will be pricks.  Over and out.

        I think the time has finally come for me to stand humble.  I'd now like to talk about an individual who has recently passed away due to Cancer.   urlLink Kevin , aka Talon Squad Leader.... Kevin has passed away recently due to serious health problems. I never had the pleasure of knowing this individual but nonetheless his death hit us all hard at  urlLink TFN . From what i hear, he is a great individual in general. Although only 22, he shared some traits that some would consider absurd. For a young man, he had exceptional priorities. The one who originally broke the news...a close friend of his,  urlLink Vertical . You can read a remap of his thread  urlLink here . Godspeed, Kevin.

        Just a few hours ago, the administration at  urlLink deviantART  announced the four-year anniversary of their site. After posting my art there for a little over 8 months, i'm damn happy to see that they've built it into such a great community varying into the different kinds of art. To  urlLink jark  and  urlLink spyed ...the world is yours. To this  urlLink fella ...the world will hopefully be his someday.

         The FBLA barbeque turned out pretty good last night. It wasn't exactly what i expected in total, but 50+ people showed up and we had some fun. Mmmmm...good old fashioned barbeque-drenched ribs...  Well, i've made another icon update tonight for TFN. I thought i had some pretty good, new material this time thanks to  solojones ,  jedi_master_ousley ,  Theron  and the poor blokes over at MilleniumFalcon.com who have no idea that they're being invaded.  urlLink Click here  to see the icons. You can also see my  urlLink archive  in old fashioned form because i'm too lazy to put them all on one page.

         Hey, everyone. As it seems, i just got my new blog up and operating for no apparent reason. I've already got a journal thing going at  urlLink deviantART , so no one really knows how long i'll be patient enough to keep this thing rolling. Probably not very long, but we'll see. I guess i'll just be copying my posts from there to here from now on. Shouldn't be too hard...should it? Hmmm, we shall see indeed. If  urlLink jark  can pull it off for 5 years, i guess i'm capable of it for 3 months....but then again he's one sex machine and i'm just some flusie. Did i just say that? Erm, okay.  So...news...news...give me some news... I'll be going to an FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America) BBQ sometime tomorrow (more like today since its almost 5:30 AM) so i guess that might be fun.  I'll probably end up getting drunk or pissed afterwards...mmm, thats news alright.  More to come after the BBQ.   urlLink
