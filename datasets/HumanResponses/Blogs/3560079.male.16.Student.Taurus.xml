       urlLink      I have just discovered a new game on the internet, which I think is going to to be the new trend to play. At least where I live.  Because it's always like that, Nukezone, everbody played it, manager zone, everybody, and Gunbound of course. I wonder why it's allways like that. Someone starts with it, someother thinks it's kinda cool and starts to play it too. And soon it is like an evil circle and before you know, the whole school is playing it. Then something happens, someone becomes tired of the game, that person goes and says it stinks and that it's just boring. Then suddenly everybody has stopped playing except yourself. All your friends' clans are gone, and how are you to meant survive now? It's just to quit for you too.  Why can't just the people who really thinks it fun play it, and those who don't just stay out of it? Well well...  This game, ouch *knocked my head*, I've written thiss much and not even mentioned the name of the game. It's Priston Tale. This is a MMORPG from Korea, I can't write any inside facts because I haven't played it. Right now, I'm downloading it. That's the biggest downside so far, it's about 500 mb so I would recommend those who have slower than a 0.5 mBit connection to not bother with this game.  From the few screenshots and pictures I've seen it looks good. For you wanna download this game here's the link:  urlLink http://eng.pristontale.com/

       urlLink www.123spill.no   I'm stuck in the swamp of cheap and bad games, and it's really fun so I don't care. =)  This is the best site I have found. It has tons of fun games, well at least fun for about 5-10-20 minutes.  Or what do you say about a game in Bomberjack, a jumpy adventure in TSK 2 or why not a classic like Space invaders? Try them all at www.123spill.no! By the way, I just caught myself posting cemmercials here, and I just wanted to say that I have nothing to do with this site except that I play the games on it =).        Wanna play a game?

      Yesterday my brother bought this snowboard game. So now I'm going to give it my opinion.  To just say it for once, this is The best game for ages. There are very few games in this class... I think that this game and Super smash bros. melee 'have been'/'are going to be' the most played of my GC-games. And definiately the ones which are going to last the longest.  Well enough about my GC. Okay, SSX 3 for gamecube is my newest game as mentioned. I haven't played as much as my brother, so I've only unlocked peak 2, but I'm very good at the super pipe for being a beginner I think, over 550 000 points is my record!(on peak 1) =D  MUSIC The music in the game is really good too. It's so good that you don't even notive that it is playing and that's when game music is the best. When it just follows the game rythm. Some really good songs, and not too few, so you don't hear the same all the time. And as far as I know there aren't any irritating sounds from the "snowers" (skaters?).  LIFETIME Well I think there are about 10 differents characters that you can complete the game with, and earn experience for. So if you wanna complete it with everybody it is going to take a while. There are three different peaks and all of the peaks contain 4 descents, and on all of these you can either just race normally or race freestyle and try to get as much points as possible, in freestyle mode there is also a super pipe. The last thing there is is freeride. In freeride mode you just snow (skate?) down the peaks from the top, and you can try out some challenges after the way down, or just collect money to buy new accesories with.  CONTROLLS The controls are just so perfect, I couldn't have done it better myself, really. It's so easy to just start snowing (skating?) but if you wanna get good you'll have to train at least a little. It is very natural buttons and not some weird combinations.  GRAPHICS This game is really beautiful. Wow, nice graphic, that looks almost like real. Well, it is really nice, smooth and not rugged/unpolished(?), so. And it really feels like you are going in fast speed here and no lag as far as I'm concerned. Really nice jumps and cool tricks.  SUMMARY I would give this game, 10 out of 10 pixels. Because it's one of the best and most fun games I've played in along time. All of the above subjects weighs into that mark. And I also need to say, that this game is not for you guys who think that an extreme sports game should be over-realistic, because here it's boost and 'I don't know what'. BTW, there are LOTS of secret ways to go ;)  Buy SSX 3 today if you have any interest in snowboard or skateboard games whatsoever!!

      Today me and my borther, was very close to buying a snowboard game for Gamecube, SSX. I think it exist for GC and not only PS2 and X-box.  But I don't know if I should try to let him buy it himself, so I can buy Yoshi's Island for GBA instead ;)... It's just soo fun! I really need a good and fun sports game for my Gamecube now I think... So it's a really hard decision... but i htink he is into buying even if we don't share the price...  I will come with some marks for a game if I get a new one.

      BitTorrent, even though this isn't new to me now, I thought I would still just going to add something about it here.  BitTorrent, so easy so good, especially for downloading bigger files at once. Just have to name two of the best Tracker sites I know about. (for anime)   urlLink Anime Suki   - This was the first and still one of the best sites, where I download torrents. It has the newest episodes of anime series, and thus also information. And it has very much contributions and is updated very often.   urlLink Boxtorrents   - Boxtorrents is the other which is the other best one. It only has whole series and not single episodes. But therefore it's very likely you get the whole series with the same sub, And it also has very much torrents, and also some older series which AnSu doesn't...

      I just think that this group is getting better and better the more I listen to there music.  I'm seriously thinking about buying there cd and that's a very rare thing for me to do (buying a cd).  Some of the better songs on it is: The Dark of the Matinee This Fire Take Me Out & Jacqueline  I haven't listen so much to the others, but remind myself that I have to listen to them a bit more.

       urlLink  GameCore.se - Två nya alkemistspel, Till PS2   As you may know, it's about Full Metal Alchemist.  Square Enix och Bandai har utannonserat två nya Full Metal Alchemist-spel till PlayStation 2. Det första står Square Enix för. Det är ett action-RPG med undertiteln Akaki Elixir no Akuma. Det släpps i Japan till hösten och i USA nästa vår.   Det andra kommer alltså från Bandai och har undertiteln Dream Carnival. Det utvecklas av Eighting, kända för Bloody Roar-serien. Inget releasedatum är satt.   Dessutom kommer Cartoon Network i USA att börja sända en ny FMA-serie till hösten.  Det här låter ju riktigt lovande! Älskar den här animén dessutom! =D... Får verkligen hoppas att action rpg:t blir bra, och att Cartoon Network kommer sända den nya FMA serien även här i Europa.  -----  For you non-swedes:  Okay this was an article from a swedish videogame site. The news was about that some game companies were working on two games, based on the Anime Full metal Alchemist, which is one of my favorites. And it also says that Cartoon Network in the USA is going to send a new FMA series. =D

       urlLink Pixel Paiku   This is the homepage that I mostly mustn't forget! My own. It's a site where people can learn japanese. Right now it's only in Swedish but I'll hopefully translate it soon.  Well I just gotta remember to update that site as much as I'm capable of. Especially now in the beginning so there will be something on it. Right now, it's very empty. Also gotta remember to use this .css-document on that site for my next version of it. (Now it's very Blue, but I don't know if it will be good with black =/)  And I'm glad that I at last have come up with a good name for the site. That's a very hard part, I think.

      This is always a paradox.  If you want just a little piece of a pizza you have too buy the whole one. That goes for almost everything. The thing I want too buy now is a CD. It's because a song from the TV-show super troupers is on it, but the thing is:  I now there aren't any other good songs on it, so I can't decide whether it is worth to pay about 20$ for just one song. It is Matilda Hellberg performing Ray Charle's - Hallelujah, I just love her(him) so. By the way, It's no good with Ray Charles, it has too be Matilda, she rocks ;).  But does it always has too be like this. "The whole for a piece". That's obviously a thing that the stores can earn money on. I think that there should be a webstore, where you can buy every song as singles, or maybe put together your "own" CD. (You pay over internet, and get the songs over internet).

      Yep, the latest thing I bought was a pair oh shoes. Quite unusual for me because I don't buy shoes too often; I'm not a girl after all.  Well, it was a black pair, that fits good to my newly bought, suit. And what is good is that they are not too fancy so I can have them during normal weekdays too =). The fun about them are that my mum and I was looking for a pair of shoes in two shoe shops, but we didn't find any good pairs. But then my mother found this pair in Coop Forum! =p (Where we usually buy food).  I bought too my graduation from ninth grade; and the suit too. The most people said that I looked really good in it, it's my first suit by the way. It's a little sad to have graduated, because I probably won't see quite many people from my class again. The teacher I won't miss as much, but still; We had some really good teachers!

      I don't know where I am in this maze of movie decoders. I have no clue why there are like 100 different for just one type of file... Maybe someone nice could just explain this to me?  Well still, this site, www.doom9.org, I really need to remember. It has a lot of fact regarding different decodes. And you can download them too ;).  And much info about music and different DVD technics. I don't knwo why it would come in handy really, maybe when I have some weird movie that doesn't want to work. It also has a good forum and a nice glossary...

      This is the first poste, Ever, in this blog. This is also my first contribution to a blog, and I really don't have a clue what a blog is. I'll just have to find out.  Just to warn non-swedish people, If you see a post or something in a strange language, it's probably swedish (If I don't say something other).  Not fun today, I have had a cold now for about 2 days, and my throat is still sore even after a kilo Vicks. (Halstabletter?).  I hope this will be a good blog for me where I can remember some sites that I visit, and hopefully somebody will think that my blog will come in handy someday.
