            Sometimes its just have to happen...you can't either stop it or miss it...Because sometimes the person don't understand you so its just a waste of time waiting.Should leave better than stay.Cause life still go on.Although you think you couldn't leave without him its just your opinion.But when you try it you will surely like to prove to him that you can't live in harmony without him or his love.Sometimes "LOVE" is just so interesting and happening.But when time come and goes you will feel really not in the mood to be with your partner.        You just feel after that that you wanting to leave him and you want him to get out of your life.After that happens then you realised what happens.But after the break up you will change to be more positive in life and have a better guy than him a better one who is caring and more understanding for you.Someday when you can't tell a guy that you like him you feel upset.But when you havetold him and he says he love you too and you became so happy to be until one day he left you and then you understand that he was just playing with your feelings like what everybody think it would happen.       Sometimes being too sincere is not so right cause he may take advantage of you or even makes your day worser than ever and leave you.A sincere guy would keep the girl happy as she could be and never left her without any good reasons.So girls to find a boy you just have to be patient and find the right one before your day came to a worse end.So beware before it happens.This is just my opinion and my own day that happen before in my life.So its up to you....my friend you have taken my advice have succeed.So you can still tell that person how much you love them but just don't take it their sweet words or else you will be so unhappy at the end...Be not too sincere and be understanding to succeed...Good Luck and All The Best To All

      Errm..Well..wat i think bout guys is simple:they are biased towards gurls,they never give in to gurls,they are so cruel to gurls,they always look down on gurls,they never trust gurls..BUT we gurls cannot live without them..Why?No One knows the answer..maybe bcoz guys are more matured than gurls..who knows..how to get the guy of ur choice?its simple..just follow my steps..when every guy wants to be with u,be with them..within a week,if u can go on with them,then go on.If not,then split up..When the guys doesn't want a break up,then timed them..its simple as that..LoLx..don follow wat i just said or u will never able to find ur dream guy..follow wat ur heart wants.dont follow wat others says..ur choice in is ur hands.no one can decide ur choice unless u decide urself..BUT its up to the parents to restu the relationship..when they dont let u get on with ur guy,cabot rumah lah..LoLx..never do that..parents are more important than ur guy..always remember wat ur parents had sacrificed for u..GuyS are sumtimes needed to cool us down..so watever ur choice is,make it a grant..GOOD LuCK!!
