         Soft, as a feather, your smile in my eyes  Sweet and tender your voice and laughter  Full of passion your hands on my shoulders  Desire in your burning look upon me  I felt lost in your eyes and weak under your touch  ...your lips on mine, your hug...  In a dream i lost myself with you...

          I cut my finger. To open a tin of white asparagus. I did it because my ex ate all the Ravioli with meat that were supposed to be for both. I was very angry, and of course hungry. I tried to open the tin with a scout opener. Don't do it ever if you don't have the experience. Bam! And a deep cut. Cazzo. Its very painful.

         This is exactly what he is. I creamed and oiled his back when he got sunburnt, i made him breakfast, lunch, dinner, cleaned his clothes, ironed, cleaned the house, peel his back when the skin was falling, took him around, got the email address of the girl he likes, did everything i could for make him feel less trapped, lost or dependent. Fucking bastard! This is how he repays me: by insulting me and offending my intelligence, by saqying i am lazy and do nothing all day! FUCK OFF! YOU! YOU DIRTY PIG!YOU STUPID MAN!YOU DESERVE NOTHING EVER!!!!!! He can FORGET anything else from me, including being taken around. I hope he cries all the tears he has as i did when we were still a couple, i cried so much i cannot anymore, and i really want to.

          Today i couldn't stop worrying to know why someone did not contact me: am i this, am i that? Is he this, is he that? Thinking about someone that doesn't show up (if not in real at least in other ways) is quite bad. I had my cousin's party and, besides all, i drunk 2 glasses of red wine. TWO, that was a record for me and it was noticed quite soon... by everyone when i started laughting after saying i was seeing everything in slow motion and my head started turning like on a flying octopus... if i was drunk i was not so much. I was lucid but not quite standing properly and even now my head is turning but less, infact i can stand and walk on a straight line touching my nose with my finger ^_^ The climax of stupidity and fun was when i was thrown water and changed my shirt in a bikini bra... everyone was just amazed to see me like that, doesn't happen everyday ^_^! But it was fun looking guys impressed to see a girl in a normal bikini bra and a skirt. Then i had to find a tshirt 'cause my mum was there too and did not agree with my clothes....ancient mother!!! And now i feel i need sleep. Goodnight world.^_^

       Today was a lovely day, hot, sunny, i went around with my ex, discovering places, amazing views, a very nice restaurant where we ate lovely. Everything was quite nice, the day infact was ok. Too much it seems. Tonight he ruined everything again. He always did it, spoiling a nice, peaceful, happy day is his favourite hobby. He started by calling me over and over to go in his room. He said he wanted a hug. I was busy and kept saying i couldn't. I was having problems with pop ups on my pc. I said no, once, twice, 3 times, 4 times, 5 times, he was never stopping. I got stressed, i got angry and finally i went crazy. I hate him. He made me have an attack of nerves, he made me angry, sad, screaming, he called me crazy when he knows i hate it, making me furious. He seems to love it, and i couldn't help being involved in it. And then to give the final touch he denied, he denied and interrupt my speaking saying he didn't know why I suddenly became like that, he started talking over and over again the same things showing he was calm, interrupting my rage, telling me I was crazy and I even scared him with my behaviour!!! He spoke over me, telling lies, saying he did nothing and saying that I was crazy, and that I had problems, and that I needed to see a doctor! Insults, lies, calm face, like a psicho in a film. And I could do nothing but cry, ask why he was behaving like that, asking him why he was doing that to me, why does he always have to ruin my happiness. And I felt abused. Then he suddenly came back to me, he hugged me wanting me to stop crying. But that doesn't change what happened, neither tonight nor the other times, is this not psychological violence?
