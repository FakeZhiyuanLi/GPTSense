          This story will sound exaggerated, stereotypical,  maybe even a little racist , but I swear to you, every word is true.  My assistant is a 48-year-old great grandmother. She had a son at 15, that son had a son at 15, and her grandson carried on the legacy by having a daughter at 16.  When you have been married for almost the same number of decades you have been alive, chances are fairly good, in my opinion, that your sex life is gonna be a little bit blah.  Such is apparently the case for my assistant, Betty Crocker.  Her name isn't actually Betty Crocker. Her name is a female name that also happens to be a popular brand of food products, much like Betty Crocker. So, from here on out, I shall call her Betty Crocker. Her name is also not Sara Lee, in case you were trying to guess.  Betty Crocker is not only raising her niece, but is a mother of six, grandmother to an unknown (but very large) number and greatgrandmother to one. This being the case, Betty Crocker gets an enormous amount of personal phone calls at work--so many that she was fired from her job over three weeks ago. They are letting her stick around until she finds a new job out of respect for her need to support each and every one of the aforementioned people. She is also supporting her husband who, apparently just ain't doin' it for her, if you know what I'm sayin'.  Betty Crocker is loud as hell. And when I say "loud as hell", I mean it in a way where you have to say it like: Betty Crocker is  LOUD. AS. HELL .   Typical things you can hear Betty Crocker shouting during one of her nine million daily personal calls:    "No, DeShawn, I will not lie to your parole officer again!"     "Listen to me VonTalia, Ray-Ray say he ain't got a t.v. and I know  you  got two. Ray-Ray also ain't got a job. What's he supposed to do all day not working with no t.v.? I be comin' to your house on Sunday after church to get that t.v., and if you ain't there, I'ma break down that door and take it myself!"     "Choo-Choo, I just paid a $1500 parking ticket fine when his car got booted to get it out of the towing lot. Don't even ask me to help you buy no new rims."   Without a doubt, Betty Crocker has a hard life. Initially, I thought that church was the only light at the end of the tunnel she had going for her.  She is, by all appearances, a very Christian woman. She ends all telephone, e-mail and written messages with “Praise Jesus and have a blessed day”.  I have recently learned that Jesus is not the only light of her life.    She is having an affair with a man named Mr. Randall Jefferson Washington, Jr.  Again, his real name is not Mr. Randall Jefferson Washington, Jr., but it is a name equally long and Presidential.  I know she is having an affair with him for three reasons:   When he calls and she is away from her desk, he tries to disguise himself as a work-related caller by using all of the fanciest words he knows in one sentence. A typical exchange might go like this:    Mr. Randall Jefferson Washington Jr.:  “Uh, yes, greetings.  This is Mr. Randall Jefferson Washington Junior speaking…good day, ma’am…may I please be granted the pleasure-ness of conversing with Administrative Coordinator Mrs. Elizabeth Crocker?”    Me:  “Sorry, Mrs. Crocker is away from her desk at the moment.”    Mr. RJW Jr.:  “Uh, yes, okay ma’am. I do apologize most heartfeltully for interfering with your workingness. Would you mind penning her a memorandum saying that I have tried to communicate orally with her on this beautiful afternoon in regards to a nature of a professionalistic manner?”     When she actually  is  at her desk to take his calls, she is very, very quiet. In fact, the only thing that I typically hear coming from her side of the cubicle when she is communicating orally with Mr. Randall Jefferson Washington Jr. is a whole lot of giggling and an occaisional Scarlet O'Hara-esque, "Oh, Mr. Washington...why I never..."  (Mrs. Elizabeth Crocker originally hails from Georgia, hence the ability to pull that line off without a hitch.)    This one's the kicker. Today she got up to go somewhere. Another reason she was recently fired is because she gets up to go somewhere for approximately 4 out of the 7.5 hours that make up our work day. No one really knows where she goes.   This time she forgot to exit out of the important project she was working on.   Her phone rang. I went to her desk to answer it.   Right infront of me, in broad daylight, in a cubicle shared by three of us was the following Microsoftword document on her computer screen, in giant pink font...it looked exactly like this, only the font was Monotype Corsiva--the fake calligraphy looking font you might find on homemade wedding invitations:    Dear Mr. Randall Jefferson Washington, Jr.,  Thank you for yesterday. I though you were going to sex me all night.  The way you sucked my titties almost made me forget my own name.   YOU TOOK ME TO THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON AND BACK [sic].    I hope I can see you again soon and that you get a job soon that you can move out of your grandma’s place. I might try and stop by next week after choir practice, if that’s okay. If your grandma’s home, I’ll just say I’m picking up my glasses, because I do need to pick up them glasses.  Did you find them?  They are either under your pillow or in the corner behind the tape deck.  Praise Jesus and have a blessed day,  Mrs. Betty Crocker

      I work at the world headquarters of a semi-famous international charity.  My boss is the president of the organization.  The president, who changes every year, does basically nothing but speaking engagements.  He spends 80% of the year travelling around the world, attending events planned by me, speaking and raising money for your standard international causes--clean water, literacy, AIDS, hunger, women's rights, etc.  When he travels, he and his wife fly first class.  Even if they are speaking in Bangladesh, they stay in hotels nicer than any I will ever dream of setting foot in.  This is understandable, since, first, they are on airplanes and in hotel rooms almost 300 days of the year, they'd better make themselves comfortable.  Second, they need to command a certain level of respect in order to get enough important people to donate money.  Still, I sometimes feel a little funny handing them plane tickets for $30,000 from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to Romania, when I know just how far $30,000 could go in both of those cities to help the cause they are supporting by going there.  To be the president, you have to be a little bit important and a little bit crazy, it's a major time commitment and you have no freedom.  Because you start the job two years before your presidential stint begins, it ends up being a three year commitment.  The organization owns three luxury condos--one for the current President to live in during his three years, and one for each of the two guys who will come after him.  The current guy is a former Prime Minister of Thailand--he is very, very old.  I suspect when he was Prime Minister he still rode an elephant to the office every morning.  He is not exactly what you'd call nice.  He's used to being catered to, and he's not used to asking for things nicely.  He likes to have barbeque potato chips and Kit-Kat bars waiting for him in his hotel rooms--not always an easy feat getting Kit-Kats to places like Afghanistan or, for that matter, anywhere it needs to be mailed.  The guy before him is a member of Nigerian parliament who's got a framed picture of himself in his white powdered wig hanging in his office--very interesting since he is a black man.  He wears nothing but Armani suits and speaks something about 10 times more formal than the Queen's English.  I avoid him whenever possible, mostly because I do not know the answer to even his most basic questions, such as, "Salutations, young lady.  By the grace of God, I hope you are finding yourself in a most pleasant state of being on this fine day, are you not?"  The guy before him is from the South.  He was born on a cotton plantation where his dad was a field hand, had seven brothers and no electricity.  He is now CEO of something and a Trustee at a lot of places and still a very downhome, nice guy.  He asks for nothing.  Yesterday all three of these guys happened to be in the office on the same day.  This only happens a few times a year.  Their three assistants put their heads together and planned a pizza party for everyone in the office.  I immediately hated this idea for several reasons:  1.  I shouldn't be eating pizza. 2.  I like to actually leave the office during my lunch hour. 3.  I get paid good money to actually talk to my co-workers, why should I do it for free? 4.  The idea of eating pizza with the Prime Minister, the Parliamentarian and the cotton farmer was a bit intimidating.  Straight away it was awkward.  I am the youngest person in my office by a good 25 years--everyone else is going through menopause, or has long since done so but still use it as an excuse when they forget something, screw something up, yell at someone or just don't show up for work.   They have a tendency to treat me like a kid.  Specifically, when there is a lull in conversation.  My mom and dad used to do this all the time...I remember leaving church, those chitchatting moments before going to the car, when nothing more could be said about dairy farming to the local dairy farmer, my mom would turn to me and say, "Honey, tell him about your new bike!"  I knew, he knew, she knew--we all knew no one cared about my new bike, but it did break that silence.  There was a lot of that going on yesterday.  Examples of, "Hey, young girl in the office, say something funny about being young...":  "Isn't this good pizza?  This is excellent pizza.  Well, you must be an expert on pizza, I'm sure you order it all the time, huh?"  muhwahahaha.  "I see you over there looking out the window.  I'm sure you'd rather be out shopping than hanging out with his old fogies." muhwahahaha.  I'd rather be anywhere else in the world right, now thank you very much.  "Do you wanna cut me another piece of veggie pizza, I'm feeling a little lazy...you're young and energetic...respect your elders!"  But the winner of the "make the pizza party as weird as possible" should be given to my assistant.  She is truly the worst employee known to man kind.  I have no clue why she was hired and no clue how she has remained on staff for three years.  She was actually fired three weeks ago, but they are letting her stay until she finds a new job due to the fact that she has like 900 children, grand children, great grand children and nieces and nephews to support.  I do not think she's looking very hard for a new job.  The three presidents were discussing a recent trip to India in a casual way.   "Did you know that they have no canned food in India?  No frozen food either."  one remarked.  "They wanted me to wear some special clothing to a ceremony, but the hat didn't fit.  They are small people!  I could either perch it on my head or carry it in my hand."  said another.  silence, silence, silence.  Finally, assistant busts in, "Speaking of India, have y'all ever been to Florida?"  Everyone drops their pizza and looks at her with confusion.  Southern president, very diplomatic fellah, ignores the strangeness of it all.  "Why yes.  I have a summer home in Florida.  Why do you ask?"  "My nephew just relocated to Florida from Indiana."  (The Indiana/India sound-alike factor is the only thing that I can think of that would explain her very inappropriate changing of the subject.)  "Oh, really?  What made him decide to relocate?"  asks Southern President.  "Well," says assistant, "he didn't really do the deciding.  He's being moved from a federal prison in Indiana to one in Florida.  Not that it'll really mean much, but I told him at least that the weather would be nicer....except, now I feel like I lied to him, because look what's going on in Florida."

      The men of Kyocera Kagoshima were allegedly studying English for purposes of easing communication on their business trips to Silicon Valley.  The men of Kyocera Kagoshima were actually studying English to further the illusion that any such international business travel might actually one day occur. As far as I know, they have yet to leave the island on the company’s dime.  Kagoshima, despite its population of three million, is a small town. Much like priests in backwater churches, for a Japanese businessman to have been transferred from Tokyo or Osaka to Kagoshima, you can be pretty damn sure that they’ve done something illegal, or at least terribly wrong.  This made classes much more interesting.  There were only three students, four including me. To be perfectly honest I was not even qualified to teach these guys what they most needed to know: basic greetings in English and how to give a decent handshake.  The textbook, given to me by the lone member of Kyocera Kagoshima’s Employee Training and Enhancement Department, was titled “Let’s Have Fun with English: Talking to American Sales Teams about your Research Findings in Industrial Use Fiber-Optic Telecommunication Goods!”  There was a lot of vocabulary involved that the Webster’s didn’t exactly shed much light on. And then there was the matter of making it fun.  I eventually learned to recognize the jargon of the trade. I knew asynchronous transfer modes, avalanche photodiodes, non zero-dispersion-shifted fibers—sure I couldn’t pick them out in a line up, but I could pronounce most of the words. As fascinating as this stuff was to the fellahs in their native language back in their cubicles, the real problem was bringing it in to the real world. How could I make English language fiber optic telecommunications come to life for them in a vivid, interactive way?  The answer was simple: On the second day of class I left my teacher’s manual on the bus.  Unfortunately, Japanese people are very honest and wonderful when it comes to stuff like that, and the textbook was returned to the Employee Training and Enhancement Department less than an hour later. The book was waiting for me at the podium where I taught class when I walked into the room on the very same day. Whoever had found it on the bus even took the liberty of laminating the front cover before returning it to the office.  My three students stood and bowed to me when I walked into the classroom.  “Good morning, everyone!” I said hyper-cheerfully. I was mandated to be as full of glee and excited as humanly possible at all times. The Japanese call this state of being “genki”—think Texas cheerleader in the Miss America interview competition.  There was no reply.  The only way to get these guys to talk at all was to address them each individually. The first reason for their silence was that they couldn’t actually speak any English at all. The second reason was that the president of Kyocera Kagoshima was a member of our class.  “Good morning, Kaicho!” I said, extending my hand for the typical Japanese handshake—nervous, awkward and wet-fishy.  No answer.  After three classes, Kaicho had still not spoken a single word of any language. Kaicho was not actually this guy’s real name. Kaicho means “boss” in Japanese, and that’s the name he chose to go by.  Kaicho had been transferred to Kagoshima from Kyoto. He was pushing 90 and refused to retire. The constant expression on Kaicho’s face suggested that he had no idea where or who he was. Nonetheless, his underlings treated him like the Pope.  “Good morning, Masa!” I said, moving on, going in for my second crap handshake of the day.  “Good morning, Sarah-sensei!”  “Excellent, Masa!” I complimented his response, “Isn’t it a beautiful day out?”  “Oh, yes, Sensei!” he was slurring his words slightly. “Berry nice day! Berry beautiful day!” He suddenly breaks into song. “Oh what a beautiful morning….oh what a beautiful day…I’ve got plenty of feeeeeeeeerrring!!!! Eberyseeng’s going my way!” Pronunciation was not this guy’s strong suit.  Masa was sent to Kyocera Kagoshima from Osaka because he has a bit of a drinking problem. Alcoholism generally serves to enhance a Japanese man’s career, but, combine that with his love of musical theater and his very unsightly buckteeth, and, well, I think they were right when they decided to keep this guy under wraps.  And, last but not least, “Good morning, Babe Ruth!”  On the first day of class, I’d invited them all to choose an English name that they’d like to be called when in the classroom.  Kaicho silently declined to take a name. Masa was still playing around with the names Yule and Andrew Lloyd and said he’d get back to me as soon as he’d come to a definite decision, as neither was particulrly easy for a Japanese person to pronounce. And then we had Babe Ruth.  Babe was sent to Kyocera Kagoshima, as far as I could tell, because of his autistic tendencies. He was, fortunately, the star student in class. This was due to the fact that his wife, who’d spent her senior year of high school back in the 60’s in Nebraska as an exchange student, scripted everything that came out of his mouth.  Babe never made eye contact and didn’t utter a sound without reading from a note card, “Good morning, Sarah-sensei. I hope you are having a very good day.” His words had no inflection whatsoever. He spoke like a very shy robot. “I am eager to learn many new things today and I have spent much time preparing for today’s lesson.”  “That’s great!” I replied. “Did you have a good weekend?”  He checked over his note card, front and back. “Did you have a good weekend.”  Typical technique for this class was just to repeat whatever you asked them as a statement rather than a question when they didn’t know the answer.  “I had an excellent weekend! On Friday--” I pointed to Friday on the calendar. “I went to karaoke with my friends!” I mimed karaoke, my pen became a microphone. Karaoke, being a Japanese word, was easy for them to understand.  “On Saturday—“ I pointed to Saturday on the calendar. “I went swimming.” I mimicked myself doing the front crawl.  “And Sunday. Or. Yesterday. I….” I hesitated. I was quickly running out of new and easily charade-able weekend activities.  Last weekend I had gone biking and played basketball. The weekend before that, I’d taken my dog for a walk and gone dancing with friends.  Staring at Yule/Andrew Lloyd and his buckteeth ear-to-ear grin, I said the first thing that came to mind. “Yesterday I went to the dentist.” I mimed brushing my teeth and made the sound of a dentist drill, then yelped a little for good measure.

                (Please see previous post “I Am Freakishly Depressed” for details of said wedding…Friday night’s “I Am Depressed” ain’t got nuthin on Sunday Morning’s “I Am Depressed/Hung Over”)   1.  The Moment When the Gay Stylist Saves Me from Facing the Bride    Arrive at hair salon at 9 a.m. to discover miserable bride-to-be. I have no clue what to say to her and she’s not talking.  Luckily, I’m pointed to Gilberto, lovely gay Mexican hairstylist and my new best friend, with whom I discuss reality show Blowout for the few hours it takes to get the hair did.  2.  The Moment The Groom Lets Us Know That Women are To Be Seen, Not Heard    Post ceremony, bridesmaids are forced to take 1 hour of pictures in and outside of church. It is hot and there seems to be a major gnat problem. We begin to sing, dance and chitter chatter to entertain ourselves.  Comments groom, “Y’all northern birds shur have big mouths…I’m glad the girl I married knows how to be quiet.”  3.  The Moment The Groom Almost Uses the N-word, Avoids It, But Manages To Be Racist Just the Same   Seated next to groom at reception. I ask if he wants green beans. He says, hilariously, “Got any fried okra down there?”  I say, “I love southern food!! Well, I don’t know anything about, southern food, but I’m sure I love it. My boss is from Mississippi and he loves mustard greens. How are they?”  Groom says, “I guess that depends. If you’re a nigge—(cough)—if you happen to have dark skin (ha ha ha), they’re pretty good, otherwise, stay away from mustard greens.”  4.  The Moment The Bestman Tries to Claim The Groom is "Wonderful" and a "Christian"    Best man, groom’s brother, gives toast on how the bride has found the most wonderful man in the world…and how proud he is that they’re building a life together based on Christian principles, honoring God.  5.  The Moment The Bestman Tells A Story About How He and the Groom Nearly Wilfully Murdered Five Mexican Day Laborers with Fireworks   Best man, groom’s brother, procedes to tell me and another bridesmaid a “funny story” from groom’s wild teen years.  Groom drove red sports car as youngster.  One night, he and his brother were cruising wild downtown Waco, Texas, when, as best man put it, “A car full of landscapers [aka, Mexican Americans, I think], pulled up next to us and started spitting spit balls from their open window into ours.”  “Well, my brother, the groom, didn’t know what to do, but he did remember that he had just bought some fireworks for our family 4th of July picnic. So he took a roman candle and lit it and threw it into the car window of the landscapers. Well, a lit roman candle going off in a car full of five people, would surely kill them all, so I tried to stop him, but he wasn’t exactly listening.”  Best man stops at this point to look at me and my fellow bridemaid and chuckle about this funny story so far…We are so, er, amused that we can barely hide our looks of horror and dismay.  He continues, “I knew the lord was with us that day because the minute it he threw it into their window, a strong wind came and blew it right back into our car. It landed in the backseat, and I just happened to have a bottle of coke in my hand, I poured right on it. We were all safe. But, can you imagine? Five landscapers would’ve died!”  6.  The Moment The Christian Right-Wing Side of the Wedding Bans Music With Naughty Language   Wedding dance consists solely of country western and big band music. One bridesmaid requests anything that might be called rap. DJ plays 50 Cent, Its Your Birthday. Grooms family immediately runs to the DJ table and puts a stop to any “inappropriate” music. Next song, Shania Twain.  7.  The Moment The Groom Fails to Say Good-bye or Thank You to Anybody In Order to Prep Himself for the Losing His Virginity   Wedding dance ends at midnight. Groom spends his last 15 minutes as a virgin smoking a cigar while his new wife says good bye to wedding guests.  I’ve felt sick to my stomach all day.

       This weekend one of my best friends in the world is getting married to one of the world’s most repulsive people…  She once woke me up in the middle of the night in our dorm room sobbing as she watched an Animal Planet series about rescue dogs and could barely get the words out…I was a little creeped out when I opened my eyes and found her head peeking over the top bunk where I was sleeping, snot running from nose, hiccupping wildly…“Sarah!” she sputtered, “These dogs…they’re amazing…they help people! You have to wake up and watch this show with me—I can’t do it alone!”  She’s always loved dogs.  And now she’s marrying one.  He is from Waco, Texas. He is a corporate lawyer fighting for the rights of downtrodden corporate gurus everywhere. He is a strict southern Baptist—as angry, smug, self-righteous and judgmental as they make them. He is 25 but looks 40. He treats her like his pretty little poodle. His family doesn’t like her and none of her friends like him.  She comes from the part of the Southside in Chicago that they spoof on t.v. and in movies. Where people love Da Bears and drink Old Style like water. Where when people say they’re proud to be Irish, they really are Irish and probably go back to visit their relatives every Christmas and summer.  She grew up poor in a tiny house so close to Midway Airport that the house shook from overhead planes 21 out of 24 hours of the day.  Her dad once left a phone message for her that we still imitate six years later, “Hey, hun. Its yer dad. Happy Valentine’s Day…now don’t you’s go doin nuttin stoopid, I may notta’ gone da college, but I know what boys dat age er like, and if you need me to knawk any’a dem blockheads on der asses, you just cawl me.”  Now she’s marrying into the worst kind of people. Small town royalty who have never left the state of Texas. Her mother-in-law is President of the Waco Junior League. Her father-in-law is all about the Rotary Club. They are nervous and uptight and constantly clenching something—teeth, fists, whatever else—when they talk.  They probably aren’t so bad. They just aren’t… us . They just aren’t her.  Last night was her bachelorette party. It was a casual night with our favorite bad foods from college and lots of alcohol. There were ten of us there and we sat around until 3 a.m. catching up, telling stories and laughing hysterically—the kind of laughing where you wake up the next morning and feel sore, like you can skip the Pilates tapes for the rest of the week.  Around midnight, her future mother-in-law called her cell phone from the Holiday Inn and asked when she was planning on calling it a night.  The bride-to-be replied, “I’m not sure when the party will end, why? Do you need me to do something?”  Future mother-in-law said, “No. But I’m just sittin’ here real worried that y’all are gonna do sumthin that’s gonna come back to haunt you when its time to move into the Governor’s Mansion…Just remember who you’re marrying.”  She got off the phone and recalled the entire conversation, laughing…ha ha ha…last thing we’d want is for anyone to know that the Governor of Texas’s wife had a stripper at her bachelorette party.  The room became awkwardly silent…simultaneous nausea.  The current President of the US, former Governor of Texas, is only slightly more repulsive than the guy she’s marrying…it wouldn’t be unheard of….  There are certain occurrences in life where the first thing that pops into my head is, “Thank God I have the option of raising my unborn children in a foreign country.” This was one of those times.  In my own head, I have a tendency to try to make mundane events in my life a bit more interesting than they are in real life.   This is probably not the loveless, Stepford wife marriage I’m portraying it to be. They have, after all, been living together in Waco for the past 3 years with only a few late night “come down here and get me…and bring a Uhaul” calls, which seems par for the course in any relationship moving toward marriage.  But at the end of the night, after a lot of drinks, she started crying much like the Rescue Dog show on Animal Planet night.  She ran into the bathroom. Another friend followed her in and closed the door behind them….things were silent for a few minutes, and then we heard her yell, “I never laugh like this anymore, okay?!” The wedding rehearsal is in two hours.

       My assistant's son has put out his first rap/R&B CD.    His name is Terrance (he is 36).    His stage name is...not kidding you....Crystylized.    So, she gives me the CD to listen to, then goes to her desk, which is in direct sight range of mine.    I pop it in.  the first song is like a low bass drum with some annoying music over it....and Crstylized rapping just six words over and over again, "Pimps, hoes, get on the flooorz!  Pimps, hoes, get on the flooorz!  Pimps, hoes, get on the flooorz!"  occaisionally it woudl change to "Lemme' hear y'all...Pimps, hoes, get on the flooorz!"    I was laughing so much, and I knew she was watching me, so I crinkled up my face and bit my lip and stared at my computer screen really seriously trying to pretend like I was concentrating really hard....it was so hilarious tears were leaking out the sides of my eyes--which I wiped away pretending as though I had a really bad headache in that area.    There was also a love ballad which is titled, "I Done You Wrong (Let me Do You Again)"...on the cover of the CD it was Terrance with baggy jeans, no shirt and one of those white baseball caps with the towel type thing hanging off the sides....he is reaching forward with one hand and standing with his legs apart--I know you've seen the pose before.    The copy of the CD she had she was just loaning me, she was planning on giving it to a fellow rotary worker, as it was autographed "To Choo-Choo.  Stay real....Crystylized."

      It is early morning, and I’m just waking up.  My bed—it is a futon actually—is unbelievably comfortable. Three soft mattresses, piled onto each other, three satiny blankets and three really expensive pillows. All have been washed and ironed with lavender water to help me sleep.  From outside, I hear monks chanting, the sound of water hitting the pavement as shopkeepers spray off the stretch of sidewalk in front of their stores, and traffic—in constant gridlock in the downtown area outside my apartment. I couldn’t put together a more beautiful symphony of sounds to wake up to—a perfect combination of ancient, old and modern. I am in Kagoshima, Japan and I am damn proud of myself for whatever I did or didn’t do to get here. I haven’t opened my eyes yet, but when I do, I’ll see the sun rising from behind a volcanic mountain outside my window. A fluttery sensation on my face causes me to open my eyes more quickly than my normal meditative morning routine. I feel something on the end of my nose. I cross my eyes to get a better look. I see something blurry and black. And big.  What the hell is this?  I sit up. To my left, a full-length mirror is mounted on the wall. I glance at myself. Fear and panic and horror shoot through my veins. A momentary sight flashes through my head—-Kool Aid being drunk through a twisty straw...that is the speed with which the terror fills me.  By nature, I’m not the type of person who freaks out easily.  I make some exceptions. This is one of them.  Seated contently on my face—-spanning the bridge of my nose to the top of my upper lip is a giant cockroach, so hairy I’m tempted to ask about the quality of the baklava in his homeland.  I bolt from my futon, catching a strong whiff of lavender as the blankets fall to the floor. I grab the nearest magazine and brush the filthy creature from my face. It lands on the tatami, the traditional Japanese straw floor, with a dull crunchy thud. Despite the girth of this bastard, I know from experience that they can disappear into the woodwork in a matter of seconds...and when they return, they’re guaranteed to show up with 200 of their nearest and dearest.  I’m breathing and moaning in such a way that the neighbors are undoubtedly impressed with the sexual prowess of whatever man has me so worked up.  I'm willing to bet money on the conversation that is happening next door, "Those American men, they are great in bed."  In moments like these, logic can really escape you. I run to the far wall of the studio, which serves as the kitchen. I grab my one and only company-issued frying pan. I'll be eating out from now on.  In my head, this plan makes perfect sense. I run back to the potato-sized roach and scoop it up. I carry it out to my balcony, which, in addition to my volcano view, more directly overlooks an open-air shopping center, already packed with stylishly dressed women. I want to fling the cockroach from the pan onto the ground below, but I can see that it would only land on some poor shopper’s head.  The roach lumbers out of the Teflon area of the pan and, before I know it, he’s crawling up the handle right toward my hand. I act quickly, depositing him on the balcony railing. I’m still in a panic, the cockroach makes eye contact with me and sneers—he could easily join the band GWAR, no costume required.  “So, bitch, you put me out for a little sun...” the cockroach grumbles with malice. “Don’t you worry. I’ll be back...and you’ll remember with fondness the day I decided to crawl on your nose—-there are other places I prefer.”  I don’t know what he means by that, but it brings me to tears. I’m sobbing, I’m hyper ventilating, I’m about to scream...A cockroach has actually taken me hostage on my own balcony.  A defense instinct emerges from that deeply animalistic part of my soul. I am a warrior, defending my $600-a-month, 12-square-feet. I will not surrender. This is war. Unfortunately, I am not well versed in the language of violence.  I being to smash the cockroach into the cement ledge of my balcony with the flat bottom of the frying pan…screaming the two words (or is it three?) that only a Midwestern girl screams in battle...  “Die-jack-ass! Die-jack-ass! Die-jack-ass!” I cry with each thrash.  Finally the roach is nothing more than a chalk outline on the ledge.  I’m still breathing heavily, but my lungs are clear. I am safe. I am free. I look to the sky—-smoggy from the traffic, ashy from the volcano, smelling faintly of ramen from the shop downstairs. The world has suddenly become silent. Peaceful. I’ve been reborn. Everything is serene.  Really serene, now that you mention it.  What happened to the monks? The hoses? And traffic? Traffic never stops here.  I lower my eyes. The bustle of the mall below has ceased completely. Literally, thousands of pairs of brown, almond-shaped eyes are fixed one me. I am one of only about 20 non-Asians in this city of two million. Store owners, cab drivers, shoppers, stray cats...they’re all looking at me.  I’m reminded of Madonna as Eva Peron in the movie Evita, singing Don’t Cry for me Argentina to the crowd. I further lower my eyes.  The terror returns. I am wearing a giant pair of bright red underwear that could surely house any random sampling of three of the bodies that are staring at me now.  That is all I am wearing.  Again, as one of only a small number of foreigners in the city, possibly the only red head, and definitely the only girl to clear Japanese customs with such an aresenal of industrial sized underwear, the attentive eyes convey one thing and one thing only:  “Sarah-sensei? Is that you?”  Sadly, the answer is yes.  I am paralyzed with embarrassment. For a moment, there is silence.  Finally, one brave soul shouts up, “Sensei, what is the meaning of jackass?”

                       This weekend we were visited by our friends Margaret and Michael.  Margaret is one of my college roommates. In recent history, Margaret has endured:   a very painful break up  a failed three-month stint in the Peace Corps in Moldova,   a long bout of unemployment which forced her to move back in with her parents in small town Wisconsin and   the bittersweet securing a very Office Space-esque type cubicle job   As a result, she went from being a cool girl with a flare for theatrics to literally the most dramatic, angry, high strung individual I have ever met.  She is also a lesbian who is forcing herself to date boys at least until she is able to move out of her parents house. This does not help anything.  Michael is her friend. He is quiet, funny, kind and smart. He is also in love with her.  Weekend activities were as follows:   Friday    drinks at a little sidewalk cafe in the gay neighborhood....alas, my plan for Margaret to meet the next great love of her life failed    Saturday    woke up early and did a little shopping in the neighborhood  had lunch at the Korean place that Antonio and I frequent  went to Milennium Park (photos above), Chicago's newest tourist attraction. It is really impressive and a great place to hang out. The concert space (where free outdoor, classical music concerts are held every week) was designed by Frank Gehry. One of the sculptures is a giant mirrored kidney bean that perfectly reflects the skyline behind it. Another are two pillars that are waterfall type things on one side and video screens showing the faces of 1000 randomly chosen Chicagoans. Every few minutes, the faces spit water. Very cool park.  dinner at Cafe Iberico, our favorite tapa restaurant in Chicago....left absolutely stuffed    Sunday    dropped Margaret and Michael off at Union  had lunch at a Thai restaurant down the street followed by a very naughty coffee type drink involving chocolate and whipped cream  did absolutely nothing thereafter....my favorite kind of day
