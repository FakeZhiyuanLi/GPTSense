      This part is going to be much shorter because i had much less 'good' time compared to the bad.   We went to King's Island on June 8th...or somewhere around there... as a 'reward' type deal for playing for the basketball and football games (once again, yes i am a band geek, but look! a benefit to the whole thing).  We also got free pizza and drinks at each of the games, and we got in for free, so it wasn't too bad.  Unlike the summer jazz thing, i'll be doing this next year.  Last weekend i went kayaking down the fearsome White River with my dad, stepmom, and brother.  That was a lot of fun.  It was kinda shallow in spots so we had to get out and push my dad's canoe sometimes.  It was my first time in a kayak.  They're great (more floaty) compared to canoes.  I almost flipped mine once when i went sideways rather quickly over a rock.  If anyone i know reads this and wants to go, we should plan a trip.  If no one reads this on the other hand, we probably won't go cause i'll forget to ask you.  I don't remember how much it was, but i think it was worth it.  We (my friends and i) had a couple parties, one of which was at my house on the Fourth of July.  Had a lot of fun.  Good times.  Parties are great when people get along and nobody really hates anyone else there.  I don't remember being at one of these kinda parties, but i heard they're no fun.  Well there you go, the good side, not much, but it was good.  I should do more of these good things to make my summer good..-er.

       Well, today is July 31, and i'm not really sure if my summer has begun yet. I think it has, but i dunno. School's over and everything, but it seems like i don't have much time to go to the pool, see movies, er hang out with friends. My summer started of on some kinda foot, but it sure wasn't the right one.       It started with a summer jazz band thing at school. My director played it out to be something incredibly fun with a trip to cedar point at the end of it all. Well, to say the least, it wasn't all that great; it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. We practiced some good music (most of the time) and we got about and hour each day to do whatever we wanted (to a certain extent...heh). But, the other time was spent watching these dumb videos, and in the end there was no trip because not enough ppl were willing to pay the money, or didn't already have plans. If it isn't already obvious, i don't plan on doing it again next year, but who knows, i might get sucked into it again.   After the jazz thing, i stained my grandma's fence. She paid me $200 for it, but it was a pain in the ass, the back, the legs, and the arms. I had to power wash it, and then i had to stain it with this oil based wood protector stuff that was like brown water. I finally finished it after about 15 or so hours. Now she wants me to stain her deck and paint the benches. I'll definitely be relieved when this is all over with.      On July 12th, i went to the oral surgeon to get my wisdom teeth pulled. It sounds simple enough, but it was terrible. I was told in the waiting room that i would get some local and some nitros, but after the 50 local shots all in my mouth, the doctor let me sit for a while to numb up, and he started. I would have asked him about the gas, but i couldn't talk very well with a numb tongue and lips. He just started pulling away. It started with a simple wiggle and pull, but it gradually went from there, to wiggle-tug-pull-pull, to wiggle-yank-wrench-pull, to drill-pull-wrench-yank. I heard and smelled some of the worst things in that short period of time. #1 worst sound: crunching/splintering teeth inside your mouth. #1 worst smell: burning tooth stuff. After it was all over, i had to eat mush for three or four days. The holes where my teeth used to be are still there collecting food. If you have to get your wisdom teeth pulled, you probably shouldn't have read this, but oh well; the damage is done for now. (The rest of the damage will come when you actually get you wisdom teeth out.)      After i got my wisdom teeth out. My mom started a project in the front room of the house (Kitchen, dining, and living room is all one room). She sarted by painting the celing and it snowballed. Now we have finished painting the celing and the walls, patching the crack in our concrete floor, putting down new floor in the kitchen, and leveling the cabinets. The Lowe's people come to lay carpet within a week from now...i think, and we have to put down baseboards after they finish. To say the absolute least, our front room is a mess- bare concrete no baseboards, unpainted trim. It sucks.      Hope my summer gets better. I've only been to the pool twice so far, which is really terrible if you know where i live in relation to it. Maybe by the time school gets back in on the 26th of August, i'll have more free time...heh, yeah.

      So, i went to the doctor for a check-up thing a week r two ago and showed him this thing in my wrist that i can move around.  He said it was a cyst.  Not anything to worry about unless it starts to hurt badly.  It'll probly be there for the rest of my life, getting smaller and bigger off and on.  My mom asked if she could slam a book on it like they did on Becker; the doctor said he couldn't advise her to do that, being a medical professional, but it might work.  That'd be the more painful approach, but if i pop it, it might go away.. for a little while anyway.  I think i'll just leave it alone.  Meanwhile, i will be keeping all of the big hard objects away from my mom....heh, i didn't mean for that to sound....well, like it sounds, or i guess like it reads.

      Don't quote me on any o this, cause most of it is just what i heard. At my dad's house this weekend,  my step mom's ex husband drove up to the house with some bad news.  My step brother and his girlfriend's two children were at home alone.  The youngest is ethan, who has to be on oxygen and a heart monitor;he's about 6 weeks old.  He was on a rug face down with a little bit of carpet in his mouth.  Honesty is just over 1 year old, and she was found in her room with a large knife on the floor. safe huh.  Both are ok now i think.  We're not sure how long they were alone, but my step brother and his girlfriend showed up 2hrs after the kids were found.  Who knows how much they had been leaving the kids alone before.  They're so stupid.  She smoked while she was pregnant with both kids, more with ethan.  Both of them smoke around both of the kids.  Child Services came and took the kids away to live with foster parents.  Hopefully we will be able to see them again, but who knows.  My Dad and step mom are still going to try to be the foster parents, but they don't know if they will be allowed to be because then, my step brother and his girlfriend would know where honesty and ethan were, and they would probably end up coming over and harassing my dad and step mom. There was a hearing earlier today, but i don't know the outcome.  Stupid people shouldn't reproduce.

       So, here's some stuff i found when i was fartin around on the internet yesterday. Don't remember where it was, but oh well. I think it was partly on some away message site.  I'm lost. I've gone to look for myself, so if i get back before i return, please ask me to wait.  talk about being schitzo (or however you spell that 's' word i just wrote)   Anything in parenthesis can (not) be ignored.   this one drives me nuts, i keep reading it over and over again.  it's like one of those things to keep an idiot busy for 30 secs.      The latest survey shows that 3 out of 4 people make up 75% of the population.   well, there's some real insight.      If toast always lands jelly side down, and cats always land on their feet, what happens when you strap a piece of toast on a cat's back and drop it?   that seems like a waste of a perfectly good piece of toast. --that reminds me...where's my cat? i'm hungry.

      A few days ago, my grandma who sells houses was...well, what else--she was selling a house.  This one was a repo that was reposessed about a year ago, and she was taking us over there to see if there was anything we could use or sell at the rummage sale we're having this weekend.  So, we went over there and looked around.  I found some percussion stuff that seemed nice, but what do i know.  So i'm gonna take it to Mr. A sometime and see what he thinks.  My brother found something a little different.  He tripped over a box and a plastic penis jumped out and attacked him.  I laughed hard at him...no pun intended...heh.  It seems to me that that's not something you would leave behind for someone to find, but ya know.  We didn't go back into that room.  Who knows what else is in there.

       Priest and Nun Caught Having Sex   A Catholic priest and nun have been caught having sex in a car at an airport car park in Maliwi.  The 43-year-old priest and 26-year-old nun were caught "in the act" in a tinted saloon car parked at Lilongwe International Airport.  "It was a bizarre spectacle, the public alerted airport police when they noticed the car shaking in a funny way," police spokesman Kelvin Maigwa told the BBC.   The nun said she had a lapse in judgement, but the priest, being a man of god as it seemed to be, blamed it on Satan tempting him.    Wh..th..hmmp...ok, now that's just weird.  Heh, that had to be a sight to behold.  The black and white musta been flyin.   Make's you wonder, what did the priest tell his wife when he got home.  Hell, he already commited adultery, why not do it with a nun, icing on the cake.

       Toy Firm Markets Talking Jesus Action Doll   A US toy firm has created a talking action doll of Jesus Christ which recites the Ten Commandments.  Herobuilders says it has come full circle and created "the only real hero:  Talking Our Lord Jesus Christ Action Figure".  It's Jesus action figure stands 12'' high, wears biblical robes and costs about $10.   Ok, so i'm not exactly sure what to say about this one.  Kinda speechless.  Where the heck would you get the idea to make a Talking Jesus Action Figure that recites the 10 Commandments?  Sometimes i just don't understand people.

       Man Thought He Was Runnings Over Osama Bin Laden  MONTPELLIER, France- A French artist allegedly traumatized by last week's Spain bombings was convicted of trying to run over a pedestrian he mistook for Osama bin Laden and ordered tp pay the man $615.  The 35-year-old defendant, identified as Pierre, was sentenced Tuesday by a court in this southern France city to a three-month suspended prison term.  The man he tried to run over was unharmed...  The victim, a man in his 30s, was able to run from the oncoming car, which crashed along the side of the street.   Talk about bad luck and bad genes.  That'd have to suck lookin like bin Ladin.  So, all of you other Osama bin Ladin impersonators/look-alikes, you better watch out.  Look both ways before crossing the street, and watch out for any of those crazy French.

      Well, i made this blog, so i figure i might as well write somethin in it, so here goes it.  Today, ...hmm... well today wasn't anything much more than the tomorrow that i worried about yesterday.  My mom's boyfriend came in to help lay the new kitchen floor.  I took my dog Pepper on a walk, but she started to take a crap in someone's yard so we had to come home early so she could finish it in her own yard.  I spent a good part of the day working on the computer.  I had to format the HD and use the 'system restore' thing for about the 100th time.  The comp is 4 years old; i guess thats probably a senior citizen in the comp world.  I had to get on the roof and clean the dryer vent, and then i got a pizza and 2 beef boats from Pizza King.  mmm.  We've been eating takeout for a week or two now because our kitchen isn't much other than a half empty...or i guess half full fridge because of all the work we are doing in the front room....or maybe the fridge is just twice as big as it needs to be....hmmmm. Well, anyway, i'll leave now.  I think i've done this blog as much justice as i can right now.

      I got my schedule today.  I don't know who's in my class cep jessie's in 3 and dharini's in 1.  Hope we all have the same lunch again.  I don't think i have any teachers that have a bad reputation.  I wanted to go to the pool today, but i didn't.  I need to go sometime.  We pay 270 dollars a year for the pool and i've only been twice, so my mom's not too happy.  I need to go a lot next week.  School starts in 8 days...bleh.  I'm kinda lookin forward to it, but not really.

      So we did end up going canoeing, and nothing really went wrong, except it was a little more $$ than i thought it'd be.  We had to take the 3hr trip which was still fun.  There were spiders everywhere, so there was a lot of screaming going on with 8 girls, most of which were screaming at some point.  Laura was freaking out the most.  Laura and Kristyn's boat musta been crooked, cause they kept runnin into things.  It was a lota fun cause me and mari kept trying to race canoes with jessie, dharini, and sarah.  I don't know that anyone ever really won; we just stopped cause we got tired.  The water was really cold, but it kinda felt good after canoeing in the sun for a while.  Nobody completely flipped their boat, but we all came close at some point.  We need to go again sometime.  Probably next year cause it's not cheap.  I think it ended up being about $120 or somethin like that for 3 canoes and 1 kayak.

      I went to the Indiana State Fair in Indianapolis. Went to a rodeo, which wasn't all bad bad. Walked around a lot, which was almost all bad. We were there for nine hours or so and were walking around most of the time, so that got kinda boring. My mom drug us into the Pepsi Coliseum to watch this horse show thing. That was real interesting....yeah. After that, we heard Reba startin her concert, so we walked over there. We didn't get tickets, but we stood around the grandstand. I saw reba's head!....heh. At least i think it was reba...i couldn't tell for sure. Coulda been a body double lip syncin for all i know. Got home bout an hour ago. I'm going canoeing tomorrow. No guys could come so far, so it's me and a buncha girls unless someone changes their mind.

      I just got back from Summer Heat.  Had a pretty good time.  I was the designated 'ride with audree (my 5yrold cousin)' person on the carnival rides, and as you know, all of the rides at a carnival go in circles, so i was feelin a little queasy.  I's all good now.  I got a bag o that kettle corn stuff (very good...why else would you go to a fair/carnival thing?).  We saw the balloons fly in and the illumination thing.  I had to drive myself there and back (darn...heh).  People are very impatient.  Oh well.  So, i think we're going to Canoe Country on monday afternoon if i can get ahold of everyone.  I'll see how goes it.

      This was a not-so-bad friday the 13th.  I had my cousinss over to spend the night.  They're 8 and 5 years old, both girls.  We went to summer heat and had a pretty good time.  We were there for about 8 hours.  My aunt has a booth.  She sells body cream and stuff "Farmhouse Creations".  She and her 'business partner' have a lawyer, an accountant, and everything.  I'll probly be over there tomorrow again.  My cousins are going to get an armband thing and ride the rides.  They want me to come and watch. I'm gonna be my mom's designated driver tomorrow.  She's having a pool party with some friends.  I have to take her in the morning and pick her up at 11.  At least i get the car all day. I'll see  you  at summer heat tomorrow. bye.

      I got up early today and  painted my gramma's benches on her deck.  That was a pain in the ass.  Paint was splattering everywhere, ugh.  So, at least i am finally finished over there.  I'm going to Summer Heat tomorrow.  My aunt has this business, Farmhouse Creations, that sells lotions, body butter, and all that stuff, and she has a booth.  I still have to see about the canoeing thing.  I guess we'll go on mundy.

      Today's been, well, it wasn't a  bad  day, but it wasn't very good either. I moved all of the cable for the tv from the floor to the attic. When my dad put in the cable 20 years ago, or whenever that was, he drilled a hole in the side of the house near the floor and said, "we got cable now." So for my entire afternoon, i got to start where he left off and finish the job. I had to stick the cable in the house up in the attic, attach all of the connectors, drill holes from the attic to the inside of walls (one hole i drilled was a little off and ended up in the living room; i still gotta patch that), drop cable down into the walls, drill holes for wall plates, find the cable that i dropped into the wall, and connect everything. Then i had to go up in the attic again to fix one of the connections cause the cable didn't work. It works now...i think. I also added a phone jack in my room. When my dad ran a phone line in my room, he just stuck it through a hole that the carpet layer made with his foot when carpet was installed 20 years ago. So i put in a jack.  Man  i'm good.  I was on a roll. After i finished at five and ate dinner, i went to sleep. Just woke up. That was nice. My knees are sore frum crawling across the attic 500 times, my lungs are full of attic dust, and my glasses are foggy cause of the dust, (i still haven't cleaned them..i'll do that now) but i'm ok...for now anyway.

      Yesterday, my mom talked to robert watson at lowe's about our carpet, and he said the installers would be there around 8.  To us this ment get all of the furniture out of the room that night so we don't have to do it early in the morning.  To robert watson, this was just tentative until he decided on what time he wanted our carpet to be installed.  My mom called him at 9:30am to ask why the carpet ppl weren't here yet.  Robert watson said that he never told us that the installers would be at our house by 8.  He said he had us scheduled for the afternoon install (11-12).  My mom questioned this and then he started on his whole schpeal about my mom not listening to him and her being a liar.  With all the trouble that we have had with him in the past ( which is a lot, by the way), plus this phone call, my mom went nuts on him.  She gave him a piece of her mind with him telling her that he is the one that knows everything, she's just a customer...and so on.  Well, my mom called my aunt who works at lowes in warsaw, and she called the muncie lowes and got everything straightened out.  The installers came around 11 and were finished in about 4hrs.  After we got everything back in place, i told my mom i had to get a bottle of pop for a thing at jessie's house and went to wal-mart.  I didn't get the pop, but i got my mom flowers.  I made her cry again (i didn't do it the first time, just the second time for her today), but i think it was ok this time.

      So, i was at my dad's this weekend...which is a whole nother posting...and mom was at the brickyard, so i stayed at my dad's last night. He had to get up fer work thismorning, so i had to get up at 6:15. I saw morning today. I even wrote a poem entitled "i saw morning today". here goes it.  i saw morning today. it looked kinda nice. i'd like to see morning more often, but it's so damn early.  Hope you liked it.  I know, i was a deadbeat this weekend, but it wasn't stuff that i could do anything about, so oh well.  It all started with this movie downtown i was gonna go to with at least one of my friends, but that plan was erased when this whole episode with my step brother, his girlfriend, and their two kids came up...like i said, that's another posting.  Then i still planned on going to sam's surprise birthday thing at tory's, but i had a family dinner thing and i didn't leave the house until about 5:45.  I got to the right street in about 10 minutes, but i couldn't find the damn house, so i went home to call people, but that was unsuccessful. So i went back to the street hoping someone i knew would be outside, but  of course, no.  Then i went bak to my dad's and called nicole and she said it was gonna be over between 6:30 n 7, and it was 7 so i said screw it.  So just so you know, i really tried, it didn't do much good..but i tried. Oh well. I'll go now.

      So i got back from a party about an hour ago. It was for dharini who'd been gone for about to months half way across the world, and it was a surprise party.  People just weren't in the party mood.  Dharini had been gone a while and wanted to talk to sarah, so that's what she did almost the whole time. I guess they're pretty close, so i understand, but we're her friends too! heh, it's ok. It wasn't as bad as i make it sound. It was nice to see dharini and nicole who'd been gone almost all summer. I would retype it to sound better, but i have a cyst. well, i'll stop rambling now. bye.

      So the carpet ppl called today and told us that it was going to be another 2 weeks before we get carpet, which sucks because we already have the carpet torn up and the furniture in the garage.  The carpet was supposed to be installed by tomorrow or friday, but they called and said otherwise.  My mom was so mad and talked the lowe's guy into having our carpet installed on tuesday.  Come to find out, our paperwork just sat somewhere for a week and it was found today or yesterday or something.  So after tuesday, you won't have to hear me rambling on and on about the carpet, cement floor, tackstrip; i'll have to find something else to ramble about.  It'll be nice not to have to eat around a patio table that's about 2 feet in diameter.  Whelp, gottago.

      We pulled up carpet today.  It sucked.  The carpet is probly 20 years old, so there was tons of dust and dirt deep underneath it.  Because the carpet was gone, all of the tackstrip was exposed so i stepped on it a coupla times.  little nail holes in my feet. ouch.  After i got the holes in my feet, i had to go stain my grandma's deck.  hot work, but not too bad. Finally, my summer's about to start, but it's already almost over.

      Today, (or yesterday, however you want to look at it) i went to the movies with a few friends to see Bourne Supremacy.  Great movie, though at times, i was distracted by certain people ( you know who you are).  It was...well.. i don't remember if it's better than the first or not...it's been a while.  I think it was better, but not worse...maybe the same-- i don't remember. Anyway, great movie.  I wanna go see The Village and The Manchurian Candidate too.  They look good anyway.  Laura suggested Napoleon Dynamite, but i dunno. It looks funny, but i haven't had good luck with funny movies lately...Oh, and before the movie my aunt took me and my brother to buy shoes...and i thought about cleaning my room(just thought you'd like to know.) Whelp, got to go sleep now.  I have to get up at 7:30am so i can stain my gramma's deck (bleh).
