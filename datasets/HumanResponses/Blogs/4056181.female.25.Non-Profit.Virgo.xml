      after several moments praising the wonders of stenciling, and with the antlers now being licked off my upper lip, i've decided that i will not let my good ideas go to waste.&nbsp; no, i will not be a procrastinator, i will not abuse time! in the recent issue of the  urlLink Harvard Business Review, "chronic time abuse"  was categorized into four styles of procrastination each with medically experted justifications from psychological understandings to causes in early child development.&nbsp; i, however will take full responsibiltiy of not getting my act together and in so doing i have compiled the following list of short term goals:     finish  urlLink naruwan  productions business plan  complete new york state non-profit laws sourcing  re-translate "naboo translations"  start magazine translations for biung   by announcing this to the world, i hope to create for myself a sense of pressure or at least motivation to accomplish these goals  faster ! it would seem though, that in 'abusing time' i am also abusing space and since i would like to think that i do have a right to&nbsp;my space&nbsp;by virtue of the fact that i exist, i will start on my list immediately.    urlLink  accompanying photo

      In spite of the announcement i made to the world yesterday, i've managed to spend yet another morning blogging.&nbsp; though this new found hobbie is both entertaining and a way for me to release / refocus my energies, its not helping me complete my list of short term goals.&nbsp; but today is different because today i have the morning off while  urlLink  biung   and little but big bro  urlLink  Bali     are off to practice Brazillian Ultimate Fighting Champ,  urlLink  Gracie-style   fighting later in the afternoon.&nbsp;our new schedule in effect&nbsp;is as follows: monday and fridays i get the morning off, since biung's on the late shift.&nbsp; thurdays biung&nbsp;practices brazillian fighting in the afternoon while i get the&nbsp;morning off--thats 3 mornings a week!&nbsp; i was so excited today that i thought i'd blog and delay getting to my list, i still have the afternoon anyhow.&nbsp; yet, it's already 1pm and i've skipped lunch it seems and biung and soliel will be here&nbsp;any minute.&nbsp; as for the evening, we're heading to the  urlLink  hot springs   (where biung works) for music and fun and i think i'll do some swimming too since the  urlLink  foundation   has a  urlLink  nice pool  .&nbsp; tomorrow, i'll hit the beach--in the morning!&nbsp;       urlLink  hotspring overview photo

      So i ended doing my swimming this morning and oh what a feeling.&nbsp; it was great, i think just what i need.&nbsp; who would think that excercise in the morning actually energizes you?!&nbsp; lunch at  urlLink  supermango   was good.&nbsp; i had the  urlLink  super seafood hotpot  .&nbsp; interestingly enough, every hotpot restaurant i've been to always serves some kind of ice product with the meal: ice cream, shaved ice, iced tea.&nbsp; this is only interesting because according to chinese medical practices, you're not suppose to eat something hot and then immediately afterwards, something cold.&nbsp; its bad for the stomach.&nbsp; furthermore,  urlLink  hot and cold   arent limited to temerature only.&nbsp; if say you're really tired, you're skin's breaking out, and/or you have a coldsore, you should eat foods that have a cooling effect on your internal systems like: watermelon,  bittermelon , green teas.&nbsp; but if you're body is cold inside (like you were just sick, or had a baby, or you have poor circulation) you should eat foods that are hot like: hot peppers, wine soups, fried foods, garlic--everything with flavor pretty much.    urlLink more pictures of supermango...   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      in slight relation to the "work life" post, on the news today was a list of stats by country regarding how much of the population diets.  koreans were in first place with 90%, with half of the female population dieting + almost half of the male pop. ... how this relates? the media: another human invention.

      though i technically am a stay at home mom, i do feel that i am able to experience a little of the work life through biung. when he comes home late at night we'll chat about the days events and about the power struggles in the "food chain". it truly is complicated living and working in harmony with others regardless if your comrades are family or new friends. and it seems sad that such human inventions as money, can serve as the defining line between how close you'd let your comrades be. in all this, i propose that if since we have already created our society to be one that requires money to perpetuate itself and so would be difficult to expect a return to nature-- or more natural way of life, we start placing value on the things money cant buy, we might realize just how rich we are...and know that we cant bring our money with us anyways when we die.   urlLink   view pix of a link in the food chain who searches for food in our home late at night       urlLink   order your million dollar bill now!       urlLink an inspirational website        urlLink view pix of someone on the road to civilization-ization

      Because movies are slow to hit Taiwan and even slower to make it down to where i am, i recently saw Spiderman 2. I thought this time around, too much time was spent on the emotional aspects like we were back in the golden days of hollywood where pages of script were conveyed in a quick closeup on the eyes. peter parker's character was adorable but dont tell me they really couldn't think of another villian and so have to recycle spidey 1's. i dunno though, when i left the theater all i could think about was two things: i want to go to new york and your boyfriend is a freaking spider. even still, i was inspired by heroic integrity.

      It occured to me that maybe i'm taking the "those handy vehicles" too seriously to the point where it could be putting me and my passengers into danger.  i find that when i'm driving and i spot one of "those handy vehicles" i will even hold up traffic to get a good shot.  on the other hand, the flow of traffic never exceeds 30mph.

      the library here is great! you can get a library card for free and check out books for 28 days. granted, there are only 75 english books and they all seem to be from 1975. the reading room does have a few english magazines though, and you can copy entire books/zines for almost nothing regardless of copywrite laws.

      On my day off, i went and saw Mean Girls by myself. don't laugh. it did satisfy my craving for a chick flick though the chicks were more like, how you say, tweens. i was entertained nonetheless. the plot: 16 year old home-schooled girl from africa is mainstream schooled by parents pursuing university tenure only to be sworn into the "plastics" (the popular good looking clique) all the while playing a double agent for an angst ridden outcast who wants revenge on the queen of plastics, but "africa" forgets or is purposely double crossing who knows? and in the end she is voted for homecoming queen and shares the crown with everyone over a heart-felt apology. i loved it! i was like, i want her skirt and her gloss! i think the main girl also played the young girl in the lastest version of Disney's "Parent Trap".   urlLink pix

      I bought two tickets for the big lottery the other day. i think it was like 16 million or something. the sales lady put my tickets in a red envelope and wished me fortune in winning. people from japan were flying in just for a shot at the chance to win. the news reported that if you stacked the jackpot bill upon bill, its height would surpass the taipei 101. we spent 45 minutes talking about lottery related anecdotes and about what we would do with the money swearing we wouldnt let any amount change us. at 8:30 the winning numbers were announced. the anticlimax lasted till 8:33.

      Cultural exchanges while i was out included a half chinese, half native american who performed tribal dances at the hotsprings. Though he is from Oregon, his dances were Meso American and he said that his ancestors eventually settled in oregon but werent originally from there. Name: RedWolf, tribe: Shoshone. Also, a half Maori, half Kiwi who will perform his  urlLink hakka  at a later date. we chatted about identity issues as a result of being "mixed". Didn't catch his name.

      Rented some good anime including a korean effort: in the future, the ancestors of the EcoBan fled to a small island somewhere in the south pacific and created a self sustaining city dependent on pollution which is eventually slavishly created by the race of refugees in exchange for minimal necessities, the Marrians, who were denied entrance into the city upon their late arrival. the marrians and the ecoban live in a classed and differenciated society where the marrians ultimately revolt and an exiled ecoban hacks into the ecoban system, inserts a virus crashing the system but saving his and his childhood ecoban sweetheart's (and everybody else's) future. i fully enjoyed this anime and the visuals were great combining digi art with actual stills, i'm guessing. check it out:  urlLink wonderful days .

      Much has happened since the last time i've blogged. to break it down: kiddie fever, lots of dvds, more cultural exchanges, pressing on with bunun nyc, birthday parties, a stroll through the  urlLink traditional market ...this week the AIT (American Institute in Taiwan) is on tour and coming to Taitung lending a good opportunity to add some pages to my passport.
