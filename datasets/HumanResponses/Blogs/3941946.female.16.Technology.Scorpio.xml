       &nbsp; When you are together with that special someone, you pretend to ignore that person. But when that special someone is not around, you might look around to find them. At that moment, you are in love. Although there is someone else who always makes you laugh, your eyes and attention might go only to that special someone. Then, you are in love. Although that special someone was supposed to have called you long back, to let you know of their safe arrival, your phone is quiet. You are desperately waiting for the call! At that moment, you are in love. If you are much more excited for one short e-mail from that special someone than other many long e-mails, you are in love. When you find yourself as one who cannot erase all the messages in your answering machine because of one message from thatspecial someone, you are in love. When you get a couple of free movie tickets, you would not hesitate to think of that special someone. Then, you are in love. You keep telling yourself, "that special someone is just a friend", but you realize that you can not avoid that person's special attraction. At that moment, you are in love. While you are reading this page, if someone appears in your mind, then u are in love with that person.

         Shit happens. its ok. but when it happens to u, bloody hell u get so fucked up. in the library rite now. no. wait. i'm not a bookworm neither am i here to pretty well read some stoopid mag, just here to update and do some entry. why? bcoz i'm a lil moody at the moment. everyone in the house had me yest'day, i couldnt contain ma anguish that i locked maself in the room like a prisoner. its cold in here cold in there cold anywhere cold everywhere, cold shoulder here cold shoulder there like i say anywhere 2 everywhere. the past renewed the person i am now. thanks to the colony and strings of people who are just mere plastic, so to speak. when u can't, u just can't. had sports and wellness a while ago and bloordy hell it drizzles as soon as i finished my last lap, this is what we cosider SHIT HAPPENS. when u're looking forward to sumthing it usually didnt turn out well so people, NEVER PUT HOPE on anything to everything, i guess just let it flow. i can't get over the fact that i'm so restless, felt so useless these few days, i hate 2004, its just not rite. first i dont even own tutorials book and got sum news that a pal of a pal met with an accident and she's just 17. I wonder how long will god be able to give me an opportunity to basically breathe.. talking about death scares me coz, perhaps i'm afraid of dying, maybe becoz i have not achieved what i want in life and if i were to live for just a while, then i earn nuhting and i'll got to hell. i dont want to go to hell. but anyway even if i die today, or while i'm typing this, who cares. heh. guess what? i shaved both sides of ma side hair and i look like shit.shit happens. basically what i typed today and now is just shit. i miss my mother. well when she's around i rarely cherished her. talked to zach on the phone and we had a bloody looong talk, he's ma bro. zach told me he wanted to just give away 50 bux for ma books but nah, buat ape nak susah kan member, i'm pawning one of ma ring, limit2 dapat gak bayar buku, beli extra pe shirt ke... bleh gak beli specs. hah, dream and dream. ni lah kehidopan, either u want to believe in ur dreams or not. i write quite long today eh? biaselah kalau orang dah merepek they can go on and on and on.. yeh.. bottomline:shit happens but u got to runaway from it by building dreams. paham? k, detailed eh, its like u got to have a dream, be it yg munasabah atau yg tak munasabah(tapi jgn jadi pantat..dream to make love with beyonce tu bukan dream bodoh..) dream to achieve something secretlie or openly and then u'll just work for it. my dreams? heh. i'll update in ma next entry. so see u soon.

      For all you people who say,   I love you   when you have no clue what love is exactly!!! Something to ponder upon... Are your palms sweaty, is your heart racing and is your voice caught within your chest?? - It isn't love, it's LIKE.  You can't keep your eyes or hands off of her/him -  It isn't love, it's LUST . Are you proud, and eager to show her/him off?? -  It isn't love, it's LUCK.  Do you want her because you know she's/he's there?? -  It isn't love, it's LONELINESS . Are you with her/him because it's what everyone wants??  It isn't love, it?s LOYALTY.  Are you with her because she/he kissed you, or held your hand?  It isn't love, it's LOW CONFIDENCE . Do you stay for her/him confessions of love, because you don't want to hurt her/him?  It isn't love, it's PITY . Do you belong to her/him because the sight of her/him makes your heart skip a beat??  It isn't love, it's INFATUATION . Do you pardon her faults because you care about her/him?  It isn't love, it's FRIENDSHIP . Do you tell her/him every day she is the only one you think of?  It isn't love, it's a LIE.  Are you willing to give up all of your favorite things for her sake?  It isn't love, it's CHARITY.  ================================================= Does your heart ache and break when she's sad? Then it's   LOVE.   Do you cry for her/his pain, even when she's/he's strong? Then it's  LOVE.  Do her/his eyes see your true heart, and touch your soul so deeply it hurts? Then it's  LOVE.  Do you stay because a blinding, incomprehensible mix of pain and relation pulls you close and holds you to her/him? Then it's  LOVE.  Do you accept her/his faults because it's a part of who she/he is? Then it's  LOVE . Are you attracted to others, but stay with her/him faithfully without regret?? Then it's   LOVE.   Would you give her/him your heart, your life, your death?? Then it's   LOVE  .   (lepas Bace ni aku paham yang aku LOVE aslam) tapi Dier Macam BABI maCam SiaL macam Pantat Macam Kedi Takde Buah... Lek... Lek....
