         Have you ever felt like you've been born into a society in which you have had no say in the regulations? It's true. Unless American people all gathered together every couple of years and had an open floor to anyone with suggestions for social norms, we are living out the dreams and ideas of our ancestors with little say in the foundations of what we are all about.        For instance... Why is it illegal to be nude?  Every other animal on the face of the planet exists in the fashion in which it was born. Except humans. When you break down the situation it sounds quite amazing:   You are born with a body. You are required to wear clothing to cover up your body. Unless you are within the walls of a building which you own(in a place where the public eye cannot see you), or a building that a  willing  friend owns, you cannot be naked. If you appear naked in a place where a public person can view your nakedness you will be detained by other humans (police) and taken into a cage where you will be locked up or let go with a penalty by means of financial payment.    Think about it. You may not want people to see you naked because you have grown up in a society that has taught you not to share your natural appearance with the general public, but wether or not you desire to, you can't. You are required to cover certain parts of your body while in public. Think about that statement: "You Are Required To Cover Certain Parts OF Your Body In Public"    Wasn't that a huge complaint about middle eastern societies? " They are un-humanitarian because they require their women to cover their faces in public " wasn't the United States of America going to free these Afghanistan women from their social bondage of having to be covered. What's the difference between this and America's outlaw of nipples, penis', butt cheeks, and vaginas? Are you going to tell me that America drew the lines of restriction at the exact appropriate place? That would be so ignorant and ethnocentric.     Let's take the time to actually think things through so that we may avoid future hippocracy.

        When did the staple of a healthy human diet transcend the border of good and evil? You can't turn on the t.v., walk past a billboard, or turn the pages of a magazine without coming accross an ad for a new "low-carb" food. Since the Atkins diet caught fire the food industry has been more than happy to supply the new needs of a carbohydrate-fearing population.    This cycle began with the Atkins diet becoming popular. The ad wizards of the U.S.A noticed this popularity and began to make products, these advertisements in turn created an even larger following. Now the average joe-america knows that "carbs" are bad. What the fuck?    Do most people understand that "carbs" are actualy carbohydrates, ie sugars, fibers and starches. Has anyone looked at the trusty food pyramid lately. If you have you might notice that carbohydrates are what you should be eating the most of throughout the day. I realize that there have been new studies showing that we may not need as much as we thought, but still, carbohydrates are a main part of a healthy diet. They are our bodies fuel. They help transport protiens (all the new rage) to our muscles.    Another thing that gets me is these "new" products that are hitting the market as "low-carb". Here's some secret information: things that never had any carbs to begin with, like sugarfree jello and diet soda, aren't new products for a carb-free environment. This new coke,C2, what the fuck? It has half the carbs of normal coke so people are going to buy it thinking that they are saving their lives. Hey, guess  what? Diet coke has no carbs, you know why? cause it has no sugar. The sugar in soda is what accounts for all the carbs. So this new C2 is just a mix between regular coke and diet coke. But, all in all this carb craze is meant to scare people. The new products are provided to make these frightened people feel secure.     Seriously, the whole carbs = evil craze is just like the media inventing an imaginary disease and selling medicine that doesn't really do anything.    I have to go now, my french bread is almost done baking.

      You know what? Blogs don't have to be all-criticizing of social experiences. I've sure as hell read a lot that are. But I feel the need to give some electronic shout-outs.    What about the guy who made it possible to record things on the digital tip? Thank you very much Dr. twentyfirst century. Now I, as well as anyone else with acess to a  computer can record their own music with a somewhat decent sound. I'm not implying that their music will be decent, but at least the technology for hiss-free recording is available.    by the way- check out Datathoughts.com, the DRugs are the new up-and-coming band. They'll get in your face.

      The ideas pertaining to "freedom" and "indaviduality" have been skewed in this country to an indescribable state. Why do we associate optimal-amount-of-choices with personal freedom.    I was in Albertsons the other day. I was walking past the small Starbucks stand they have so conveniently set up inside the store and I had the most unfortunate opportunity to overhear a woman ordering her "coffee". She ordered her drink as if she was reciting some portion of the declaration of independence, memorized for a fourth grade presentation. "I'll have a double-soy-chai-latte-with extra foam-at 140 degrees." 140 DEGREES!!! How on God's green earth does this woman have any idea at what temperature she preffers her coffee. Maybe she should have been more specific though, you know...she didn't really specify whether that was 140 F or celcius. The Starbucks employee might misunderstand and fix her a grande cup of molten lead.     I guess what I'm getting at is that coffee is coffee is coffee. I'm embarrassed to be a member of a society where these kind of specifics are all too important in the lives of many.    PS- Juan Valdez has been bustin' his hump for generations of content coffee consumers. So, step outside of the tiny bubble you live in... and get on the donkey.

         100% mountain spring water and the finest "high-country barley".    Coors Origional...     As far as the cheap beers go you just can't beat coors in the can. When the cold aluminum hits my lips I'm taken away to an imaginary log cabin where jimmy dean is griddlin' up breakfast and ted nugent is gettin the gear ready for our bow huntin' trip.   We're gonna be drivin' the quads. It's muddy out. Lucky for me I got on my rubbers over my flannels.    I'm a little tired cause I stayed up all last night with charlie daniels, we were jammin out on the front porch by lamplight. We had a pit fire going to ward off the skeeters....   After that last sip though I get thrown back into the here and now. A game cube and a drum machine are poor substitutes for a boning-knife and my lucky hawk feather.   ps- Newcastle and Guiness are great, but everyone should spend a little time at the cabin now and then.

         Why does Ahslee Simpson have a show about her life? Who is ashlee simpson? Reality tv is the biggest hoax of all time, hands down. Seriously...a tv show about someone's real life events. What the fuck? Aren't we all living real life events as we speak? We go through these same things all day everyday. Why is it interesting to watch jessica and nick order chinese food and decide what movie to watch?     I think in a year from now we will have reality shows about people watching realty shows. Then VH1 can do a show where a they "re-cap" what happened during the show and all these stupid comedians can sit and do the commentary and make fun of the whole thing and talk about what a stupid show it was and how dumb the people were who were in it, and how what they did and how they dressed is so "5 minutes ago" now.      How can VH1 sit and make fun of all these shows and videos that they used to play and advertise not too long ago? Man... they seriously have the best formula: Make a product, convince everyone that it is cool, when the heat dies down make a show about how stupid and gay it was to begin with.  You see, there's no waste product. Mtv can make a show all about the behind-the-scenes drama of an awards show that they initially made to honor videos that they initially played.     For the love of God, please don't watch mtv or vh1 !!!!!

          Reality can strike, and when it does it sometimes stings. There are many instances in which life is put into perspective. One is when you feel like everyday is leading towards the uncomfortable closeness of being "elderly". That usually happens when I'm stoned and watching tv or thinking about people who I consider to be old and I think about the fact that they were young once and had the feeling that  youth is eternal and life can be all good-times, then age snuck upon them like a silent assasin and they realize that they had their throats slit before this game even began. Those people woke up one day to find that they don't have such quick reflexes and society doesn't think they're cool anymore, they aren't attractive and are way past their physical prime.     Sometimes though, I feel like life is composed of a trillion or more beautiful moments and it's almost too much to take in. Think about it. A slightly overcast day, sitting with a really good friend, you're both on your fourth beer, and in the middle of a conversation about your plans for a future that leaves you both with this feeling that life is laid out ahead of you. Whenever the sentence crosses your concience, out loud or in your own mind, " It doesn't get much better than this " you have to give thanks to whatever power put you here in this life. Be it fate, God, or some collection of peaganistic fancies. Moments like this make me think that all of life is like this and the only reason it doesn't seem so is because sometimes we forget and refuse to accept it.         Does the "good" in life outweigh the "bad" or the other way around?
