      This will be my last post of the day because I have a lot of important drinking to do tonight.  New on  urlLink HRDC : two call centre jobs in Woodstock; clerk at a craft store in the soon-to-be-dead Brookside Mall; public health nurse (what did I just say...?); another babysitting job; cashier at Tim Horton's.  Been there, done that.  I may as well recount the horrors of the summer I spend selling soup to old people in the Regent Mall food court:  You can't tell from the uber-cute avatar I use as my profile pic, but I have a piercing in my upper lip.  When I was given the honour of slinging Tim Horton's coffee for $5.90/hr, they made me wear a fucking band-aid over it, making it look like I had a moustache.  Seriously.  I don't know why I didn't tell the manager to go fuck herself right then and there... I probably needed money for beer and cigarettes or something.  Anyway, the band-aid also caused random customers to take me asside and ask if my boyfriend hit me.  HEY ASSHOLE: IT'S NONE OF YOUR GODDAMN BUSINESS WHAT I DO ON MY OWN TIME!  Now go eat your blueberry fritter and leave me the fuck alone.  The assistant manager was a fundamentalist Christian who clearly hated me from the very beginng.  Whenever the manager was looking for somebody to do a shitty job nobody wanted, she always volunteered me.  Even the other people I worked with noticed that she treated me differently.  Look, I realize that the fact that I drink, smoke, dye my hair and *gasp* wear pants offends your Christian sensibilities, but grow the fuck up and show some professionalism.  When I was hired as a Timmy Whore, I was promised at least 35 hours every week, but most of the time I was lucky if I got 20, making it really difficult to get groceries after I bought liquor and smokes.  My solution to the problem was to take home a couple of grocery bags worth of donuts, muffins and bagels at night after the store closed.  I also used to give some of the food to my friends who were either unemployed or working at other types of shitty jobs.  (Tip: if you're poor, it pays to have friends in the food service industry.  I don't know about you, but I get sick of Mr. Noodles and Our Compliments Kraft Dinner pretty damn quick.)  Anyway, this is very much against the rules at Tim Horton's; donuts that were for sale to the public 1 minute before closing are unsafe to eat 1 minute after closing, so you can't take them home, nor can you give them to the homeless shelter.  Makes sense to me.  I also happened to be working the afternoon and evening of 9/11.  I don't know what it is about Tim Horton's coffee, but I'm beginning to suspect that there's some agent in it which causes frequent consumers to become equal parts ignorant and obnoxious.  Starbucks coffee, on the other hand, causes people to become smug and self-absorbed, but that's neither here nor there.  Anyway, I had to smile and nod at all manner of idots comming in saying stuff like "They should just round up all them A-rabs, then kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out".   Anyhoo, to make a long story a little bit longer, it eventually came to one of those situations where I could either quit, or would be fired for my donut-liberating ways.  I came in for my 6-hour shift one afternoon, having spent the previous 6 hours on campus attending university classes, and said to the shift supervisor, "I can't keep doing this. I'll work today, and if you can't find somebody to cover my shift on Thursday I'll come in for that too, but I'm out of here at the end of the week".  She said, "I can work your Thursday shift if you want." and that was the end of that.  Except when I went in a few weeks later to pick up my official Record of Employment: it said that I had been fired because I didn't show up for a shift, so as to ensure I couldn't collect any unemployment benefits.  Motherfuckers.

      This is what the offending "edit" page looks like in IE:           What is up with this site? Every web developer I've ever talked to about such things always says "For the love of god, get rid of Inernet Explorer and please use a standards-compliant browser like Firefox!". So that's what I do, and then one day, for no apparent reason, this site looks all fucked up. What's the deal with Blogger, kids?     Moving right along... new today on  urlLink HRDC : cashier (another dollar store job... if I didn't know better, I'd begin to suspect dollar stores were a shitty place to work so that's why they always seem to be hiring....); registered nurse (why am I being penalized because I suck at science and math so I decided to study NOT science and math at university?).    Edit:  I downloaded the newest version of  urlLink Firefox , and everything's magically fixed. A note to the staff: if changes are made to the site that might make it look fucked up in certain browsers (not everybody uses IE or Netscape, you know) you should make a post in the news section about it.

      New today on  urlLink HRDC : cook with Aramark (wouldn't that be sad... spending 5 years at university only to end up working in the cafeteria?); driver salesperson (read: traveling salesman); cable television technician (cool, then I could make people wait around from 8am to 5pm only to show up at 6:30 and leave one of those little notes on their door that says "sorry we missed you, please call Rogers to schedule another installation appointment"); sales associate (at that kiosk in the mall that sells nothing but ink cartrages); babysitter.  That last one really gets me because it only pays $7 an hour, and not because I would apply for it if the pay was better, I can't stand kids.  Anyway, the job is in Forest Hills, so the parents are obviously not hurting for cash.  It amazes me the way in which people devalue child care in terms of financial compensation.  Taking care of kids is one of the hardest jobs I can think of; shouldn't it be worth more than $0.90 above minimum wage?  What the hell is wrong with people.

      New on  urlLink HRDC : flatbed truck driver; call centre agent (what did I just say about telemarketing jobs...?); security guard.  My friend John is a rent-a-cop, er... security guard.  The local phone company has been out on strike for months now, so John was hired by a private security firm to guard the phone company's property.  The strike has gotten ugly enough that workers have apparently been cutting phone lines and that sort of thing.  Anyway, the point of this digression is that John is essentially a strike breaker, and if you knew him, you would see the humour in this.

      The woman at Connect just called me back and she got my resume etc. etc. etc.  She said they'd be having a meeting either later this week or early next week about what kind of qualifications they're looking for etc. etc. and would probably call me for an interview later next week.  This, of course, was all after she tried to hassle me into applying to work for them as a telemarketer.  Jesus, if that's all I wanted, does she really think I'd be making all this effort?  They'll give those jobs to anyone who can talk and type at the same time and isn't overtly mentally ill.  Anyway, so I guess this is all very promising... I'm still not happy at the prospect of graveyard shift though.  In other news... I checked  urlLink Workopolis  for the first time in at least a week, and lo and behold there's a temp agency looking for office monkeys in my area.  By the end of the day I'm going to send off a copy of my standard bullshit cover letter and resume, where I say things like "I can offer your business a unique mix of skills, talents, and enthusiasm" and "Besides flexibility, I can also offer your business my ability to work well as part of a team, a skill I gained as a result of my employment with Tim HortonÂ’s".  And it makes me feel so dirty.

      I just called Connect, got the voice mail of the woman I needed to talk to... "We spoke last week blah blah blah... I mailed my resume blah blah blah... just wanted to follow up with you blah blah blah... wondering if you've started doing interviews yet blah blah blah..."  I just  know  she's going to call me back during the squid show that's on the Discovery Channel at 3:00pm.  New on  urlLink HRDC  since I looked last:  amusement ride operator!  Fuck yeah, I'd love to be a carnie!  Except the ad says you have to own a half-ton truck.  Jesus H. Christ.

      It's pushing noon and... wait, it's 12:01... and I've only just now gotten the internet working again.  I'm gonna wait until sometime after 1:00 to follow up on the call centre thing I mentioned yesterday.  New so far today on  urlLink HRDC : two postings for retail sales clerks, both at Dollarama.  I love that place, but my old roommate used to work there as a stock boy and hated it.  He said that the regional manager was a bitch who came in every week and loudly complained to the store manager about the doctor of Scrud needing to cut his hair.  That and he was always being hassled by customers about "snowman plates".  Apparently Dollarama sells dinner plates with snowmen on them which are in high demand among the social assistance set.

      The following is an excerpt from this week's  urlLink Savage Love :   Did you know that if you Google "huge breasts," you get 1,170,000 hits? But if you Google "huge balls," you get only 67,000? And that if you Google "huge asshole," you get 8,830â€”including a link to the official White House web site?  My assistant, Mahrya, discovered these amazing facts, BREAST, while tracking down Tiffany Towers and Wendy Whoppers, neither of whom responded, as they say at The New York Times, to my repeated requests for comment. I could have looked up "huge breasts" myself, I suppose, but enormoboobs are so early- to mid-Clinton-era, you know? I like to reserve my time for researching newer, freakier fetishes, thank you very much, so it seemed like the perfect assignment for my assistant. Apparently not. Shortly after tracking down Tiffany Towers, Mahrya informed me that she's moving on. It seems my assistant found more respectable work at a law firm where she won't have to Google "huge breasts" ever again. (The partners will have to Google that for themselves.) While I'm sorry to see Mahrya goâ€”thanks for everything, Mâ€”I am looking forward to hiring a new assistant. Does spending the day Googling enormoboobs, tracking down retired porn stars, and gently reminding me about deadlines I've already missed sound appealing? Send me an e-mail. (Male applicants are encouraged to enclose pictures of themselves in Speedos.)   The following is the email I sent to Dan Savage in response to his job posting:     Dear Dan,   I'm a recent university grad who's been vainly searching for administrative work in the wiles of eastern Canada.  I live in Fredericton, New Brunswick, about a four-hour drive from your friends at Venus Envy in Halifax, and about an hour and a half from the Maine border.  Anyway, I would be more than happy to relocate to sunny Seattle if you'd be willing to hire me as your assistant... I've got a brother in Portland and I love the Pacific North West.    Working as your assistant makes perfect sense for me because since I've been unemployed, I already spend a great deal of time Googling terms like "huge boobs".  I'm sorry that I'm not a boy who wears Speedos, but rest assured that my bushy-tailed enthusiasm will more than make up for my missing appendages.  I've been a fan of yours for years, and I promise to never leave you for a law firm.  I've attached my resume, and I hope to hear from you.  Cheers,  Mary   Hello dream job!

      Here's some more new jobs posted on  urlLink HRDC  since I looked last:  truck owner/operator; mechanical engineer; cashier (at the Mail N' Mart, that place that used to get robbed all the time!); counter atendant - food service; cashier - customer service (at Pets Unlimited... hmmmm... isn't that the store currently facing a sexual discrimination lawsuit?).  New today from my friends at  urlLink Monster.ca :  Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative/Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program Coordinator; Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Coordinator; 	Clinical Dietician; Territorial Coordinator, Community Wellness Programs; Condominium Coordinator.  Oh wait, despite the fact that I swearched for jobs in Fredericton, all of these are in fucking Iqaluit!    Then I looked at the classifieds in my local paper.  There were two ads from "escort services" looking to hire "new ladies".  My boyfriend gets pissy when I fuck other people but if it weren't for that, I would seriously consider it.  Hey, at least then I wouldn't have to "work" more than a few hours a week and could still pay rent.

      Still nothing new on  urlLink Career Beacon  today.  I don't know why I continue checking that one, it's updated sporadically at best and the only jobs openings which seem to be posted there are in medicine or some other field in which I have no training nor experience.  New postings so far today on  urlLink HRDC : physiotherapy assistant; flatbed truck driver; mechanical engineer.

      9:52 am, just woke up.  Checked  urlLink HRDC Job Bank  and  urlLink Career Beacon  site, nothing new except one construction worker job on HRDC.  Yeah fucking right.  Tomorrow I will follow up on that call centre job I applied for last week... it's at an out bound centre as a "Call Centre Quality Verifier".  Basically you sit alone in a room for 8 hours listening to taped calls and writing reports about what people did wrong.  That sounds like the perfect job for me, seeing as how much I like to be left alone and criticize other people.  The only problem is that it's Monday to Fiday, midnight to 8:00am.  I don't like that idea, if for no other reason than this place is downtown near all the bars so I wouldn't be able to get to work without walking through hoards of drunken morons.  Night shift isn't good anyway, it makes it difficult to have a social life on your days off.  Also I would never have sex again.  If I get it my hope is that they'll be so blown away with my abilities to be overly critical and work without supervision that they'll switch me to days before long.  Here's hoping.

      I'm unemployed.  Sometimes I don't mind it, like when I get to lay around all day watching TV, downloading porn, reading comic books and playing SNES games.  Other times I hate it.  Like when my bank and credit card statements come.  And those unnerving letters from the student loan people saying they want their $45k back.  Those are the absolute worst.  Basically, I've gotten bored and cranky enough that I've decided my unemployment should be chronicled... but somewhere other than in  urlLink my SuicideGirls journal  so as to not bore to death all my porn friends.  Hence: Destitute is the New Black!.

      Finally. Blogger has been all wonky again today. I don't know if it's another "we hate anyone who doesn't use Internet Explorer" issue or what. I can't get the spell check function to work, along with a lot of other small things which add up to make my Blogger experience extremely frustrating. If I had anything better to do, I wouldn't even bother updating.    New today on  urlLink HRDC : 2 jobs at Burger King (no comment necessary); "customer service representative" for Blue Cross (as much as I'd love explaining to old people why their insurance company won't pay stuff they need in order to live, I think I'll pass); a farm labour job; delivery driver (I don't have a car or a driver's license, so not even if I wanted to...); car washer for Hertz; baby photographer at Sears (I'm pretty sure infantacide is still illegal in Canada, so it's probably not a good idea); office furninture installer (my friend Radio Nick does this and doesn't mind it, but it says you have to have a driver's license); school bus driver (awesome, I'd get to yell "sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up!" all day, but I'd have to get a bird to live on my head).

      Finally, a job which meets my extremely generous criteria for bothering to send a resume. An anonymous "salon" downtown is advertizing in  urlLink my local paper  looking for a full-time receptionist. Kick ass, maybe it'll be Sue Lawrence so I can get my hair and nails done for next to nothing.

      More of the same on all the job sites... shitty retail/food service/call centre, or other jobs that sound only semi-shitty which require 3 to 5 years experience minimum. Instead of listing them and making snide remarks like I usually do, I'll lay out my job criteria (eg: a job must meet all of the following requirements for me to even waste the printer ink to send them a resume):   1. I need regular, consistent working hours.  I need to have the same schedule every week, and the same days off. Otherwise it's fucking impossible to make plans to do stuff on my own time more than a week in advance. I also need to work at the same time every day -- I need a regular routine so I can eat/sleep/go to the gym at the same time every day. The actual days I work or shift times aren't terribly important, provided they are consistent.   2. I will not work for less than $8/hr.  Anything less than that is an insult to the last 6 years (and $45,000+) I spent going to college and university. Besides, I couldn't survive on less than $8/hr even if I wanted to.   3. I will not work in a job where I am required to absorb verbal abuse, insults and/or sexual harassment with gentle good humour.   This stipulation pretty much rules out the entire service industry.     4.  Unless I'm being paid $15+/hr, I will need at least 35 to 40 hours per week.   It's only fair.

      New on  urlLink HRDC  today: truck driver; typist (tell me where Grafton is and I'll do it!); automobile wrecker (you have to bring your own tools); logging truck driver; insurance salesman (I couldn't even sell water to people dying in the desert); sales associate (at The Wicker Emporium!!); hairdresser; aesthetician. My friend Laura is an aesthetician. She says she waxes pubes all day. I don't care what the tips are like, that doesn't sound like a good way to spend half my waking hours.

      Oromocto is a small town/suburb about 10 minutes outside of Fredericton. As of yesterday, it is losing one of its major employers, which will throw about 700 people out of work at the end of next month. On top of laying off their entire staff, RMH Teleservices is also jerking around their employees and not giving them proper severance benefits. Here is a  urlLink link to the CBC story .  As badly as the layoffs in the civil service affected the job market here (provincial capital and all), we ain't seen nothin' yet. You see, the government laid off 750 civil servants province-wide back in the spring. RMH, however, is laying off 700 people in this community alone. It's gonna be a rough winter.  As for me, I have 10 form letters and resumes ready to go, all but one of which are unsolicited grovelling to random banks and consulting firms. I gotta walk down to the post office to mail 'em and then officially max-out my line of credit to pay my August rent.

      There's some movie coming out soon that's using "Man in the Box" by Alice in Chains in its commercials.  AiC were by far the weakest of all the "grunge" bands and now I have one of their shitty songs stuck in my head.  It's gonna be an awesome day, I can tell already.    Today I'm going to print off a form letter and resume for yet another receptionist job, this one is for some company that sells wheelchairs and makes customized prosthetic limbs.  You can't make this stuff up.  Anyway, that should take about 10 minutes and I don't really know what I'm going to do with the rest of my day.    If you're reading this before 4:00pm AST, answer me this:  Do you think I should follow up with that aesthetics salon today, or do you think I should wait until Thursday like I was going to originally?  If I call today, they probably haven't made a decision yet, but if I wait until tomorrow it may be too late to change their minds.  I'm crap at gauging these things.

      Nothing new to report.   More of the same on all the job sites and in the paper.    The woman who interviewed me yesterday for the receptionist job said that since she's going to be talking to so many applicants, she probably wouldn't be able to contact everyone.  She said that if I don't hear from them by Friday, then that means I didn't get the job... so I'm going to call them on Thursday to hassle them some more.  Hopefully they will at least call my references.  For some reason they loved me at my last job.    I also never got around to calling CD Plus.  I'll wait until next week after I find out what's going on with the receptionist job to do that.    The woman from  urlLink FRYS  called me back yesterday too.  After talking to her, I've decided against applying for that job.  Apparently "youth care worker" entails working in a group home... you know, those places where they stick kids who aren't quite bad enough to go to prison, just got out of prison, or are otherwise too messed-up to go into regular foster homes.  No thank you.  I'm a bleeding heart liberal, but when it comes down to it I don't have the kahunas to make a career out of helping the truly disenfranchised.  This is one more reason why I need to be independently wealthy (winning the lotto would work just fine); so I can give tons of money to homeless shelters and boys & girls clubs without having to actually  do  anything.   Am I lazy and selfish or what.

      The job interview was a big non-event.  It lasted all of about 10 minutes, and she didn't really ask me anything, other than to confirm what was on my resume.  She seemed pleased by the fact that I'm unemployed so I could start right away if necessary.  However, she also said that she plans on talking to between 40 and 50 other applicants by the end of the week... I concluded from this that my chances are probably not good.

      Holy shit, I have a job interview! First one since I started looking for work back in May... it's for that receptionist job I applied for last week at an anonymous aethetics (sp?) salon that ran an ad in the local paper. Anyway, I'm freaking out because it's in an hour and a half and I have nothing to wear! Motherfucker!

      I called the number on the  urlLink FRYS  website which was supposed to be their main office, but I just got a voice mail message saying that whoever is in charge of answering that phone will be away until sometime in August.  Fucking awesome.  So instead I had to send them a lame-sounding email asking them to call me.  The deadline for applying for the youth care job is this Friday, so hopefully they're on the ball about checking their email.

      So here's the plan for today:    1.  I'm going to call  urlLink Fredericton Residential Youth Services , because apparently they're looking for a part-time "youth care worker".  I don't know what that means.  The ad says "Youth care workers are responsible for the general supervision, daily living support, behavioral intervention and crisis management of clients".  WTF does that mean?  It also says "Qualifications: a Bachelor level degree in the social sciences field or a minimum 2 years post-secondary education with related work experience".  See, the thing is that technically I'm, like, a credit short of a B.A. in sociology and I have absolutely no experience working with youth-at-risk (or whatever they're calling difficult kids these days).  Anyway I'm gonna call them and see what's up.    2.  I'm also gonna call the King's Place location of CDPlus.  CDPlus is the kind of mall record store that sells Dead Kennedys and Misfits t-shirts, but doesn't carry their music.  Nice.  Anyway, if I worked there at least I wouldn't have to work a lot of nights or any Sundays because that mall is mostly only open from 8am to 5:30pm Monday to Saturday.  Also it's downtown so I can walk to it from here and I don't have to be trapped in the mall during my designated break periods.

      No, I haven't been drunk for the last 4 days... 2 of the last 4, tops.   No, not drunk, just regular TV-watching lazy.  Earlier Avril Lavigne kicked the tar out of Yellowcard on that  urlLink CombatZone show on Much Music .  And  urlLink Trailer Park Boys  is on right now, and it's the one with Rita McNeil.  Kick ass!  TV is fucking awesome.  Anyway, I've had a lot of important drinking and laying around to do these last few days, so I've been slack with the writing.  Regular service will resume shortly.  I swear to god.

I'm applying for a job as a secretary in the math department at  urlLink UNB , a job which I will not get because I have a combined total of 6 months experience rather than the required minimum of 3 years.  I am  not  applying for  urlLink a job in the public relations branch of the government department I used to work for , regardless of how much I would like to.  Despite having glowing recomendations from many of the higher-ups, I do not have a minimum 4 years experience in public relations, nor do I speak French.  Sadly, I also have no means of obtaining either of these skills.

      Nothing much new to report today.  I filled out an online application for  urlLink Future Shop  since they're building one uptown.  I'm also gonna send a cover letter and resume to  urlLink Chapters .  Oh we're into the dregs now.

         It's the August statutory holiday.  In NB, it's New Brunswick day.  When you're unemployed, holidays suck ass because it just means that  urlLink HRDC  doesn't update their site, and I can't buy groceries because Sobey's is closed.  It's damn hot too.    Maybe I'll just get drunk today.  Regular service will resume tomorrow.

      I didn't have a chance to do this yesterday becasue I was in Sussex all day at the dentist getting two fillings.  They had to freeze my mouth three times, so it took fucking forever to regain the feeling in the right side of my face.  Anyway...  This is how bad it's gotten; I'm getting rejection letters from companies to whom I don't even remember sending resumes:   August 9, 2004  Dear Ms. G----:  Thank you for your interest in a position with KDS or affiliated companies.  Unfortunately, we are not hiring at the present time.  I would be happy to retain your resume on file for future opportunities.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or if you would like to update the information on your resume at any time, please feel free to call me at 506-45x-xxxx.  Warm regards, SAWMILL CREEK FURNITURE COMPANY LTD.  Janelle Doan Director of Human Resources

      The work with my distro is still ongoing... I've mostly finished the business plan except for the financial parts, and I've arranged for a meeting with somebody named Larry from Enterprise Fredericton to get help with it on Tuesday at 10:00.  Note to self: iron lone dressed-up/job interview-type outfit on Monday night.  I've started a *private* LJ to chronicle the process.  I'm keeping it private mainly because I want to make it into a zine eventually, don't take it personally.  Anyway... there was a posting on HRDC yesterday for an office clerk for a lawn care company, but I just checked them out and they're located out in the sticks, far beyond the tiny parametres of Fredericton Transit.   C'mon government grant....

      My Enterprise Fredericton package did indeed come today.  Among other things, there was a pamphlet about an online asstant/wizard for writing a business plan, so I've been working on that for the last several hours.  My head fucking hurts and it's too hot, so I'm stopping for a bit.  It's really fucking hard too!  The parts I've been working on aren't that bad (What makes your business unique from your competitors?  What is your business' mandate/objective/philosophy?), but it's gonna get a lot worse when I get to the real logistical parts.   HOWEVER, this will all pay off when I can sit around on my ass all day answering mail, listening to CDs, and reading tons of free zines.  Yes.  Yes it will.  And better still, I will be the envy of all my friends.  Awesome.

      I really wish I had more to write here.    Well, here's my "Extended" horoscope for today from  urlLink Yahoo! Astrology  (thanks to  urlLink crippled_and_blind  for giving me the idea for this):   You've been spending your time making lists and checking them twice, so you are definitely ready for the next step. It's time to stop fooling around and get serious. Now that the details are taken care of, you can move on to more exciting things. The big picture makes an appearance in your happy little vignette. Do what you can to keep control of your current projects. If you don't start making some changes on your own, certain things may be decided for you.   Does this mean that my  urlLink Enterprise Fredericton  package will come today????

      This caught me by surprise.    I assumed that with the volume of mail  urlLink Dan Savage  must receive, he couldn't possibly have time to repsond to it all.    Apparently I was mistaken:   thanks for sending in your resume, mary.  if i replace MD, i will have to hire someone local (i'm in seattle), and i'm not even sure that i'm going replace her at the moment.  and the job doesn't pay enough -- by a long shot -- for anyone to move from one country to another, and across a continent.  i couldn't live with myself if i dragged you all the way out here. xo dan   Well that made my day.  I also called  urlLink Enterprise Fredericton  this morning, and they're sending me some sort of "start-up kit".    Hmmm...

      Sorry I've been slacking with this.  As many of you who know me from elsewhere are already keenly aware, besides blogging and looking for work, I also publish a zine called  urlLink Fistful of Bees .  I've spent the last several days getting the first print issue xeroxed and ready to go, as well as tracking down various distros.  With great success apparently, as I have a big stack of international mail to take to the post office tomorrow.  Anyhoo... with all this leg work I've been doing for free recently, it occurred to me that I ought to be paid for it.  So, first thing Monday morning I'm getting on the phone to  urlLink Enterprise Fredericton  to get info about starting a home mail order business (read: zine and music distro).  My big hope is that I'll be able to get a government grant of some sort to do this... enough so I can buy a new PC and hire someone to design a slick-looking webpage.  Not to mention feed myself for the first year or so while it gets off the ground.  According to my preliminary research, there should be plenty of government cash for me, seeing as I'm female, under 30 and a resident of the notoriously impoverished Atlantic Provinces.  Am I industrious or what?

      My worst fears have been realized.  Regular viewers will be already know that I sent a resume and bullshit cover letter to  urlLink Chapters  a week or two ago because of my increasingly desparate financial situation.   For the uninitiated,  urlLink Chapters  = Barns & Noble in Canada... big box book stores located in or near malls with a Starbucks location tucked neatly in one corner.  Anyway, they called me for an interview today.  Because I am now in the process of maxing out my "emergencies only" credit card with the $500 limit, I had to say yes, even though it's only part time (she said it would be between 10 and 25 hours a week) and presumably minimum wage.  So tomorrow at 2:00 I have to put on my job interview outfit, catch the bus uptown, and then sit there and pretend that selling products which include scented candles and cocktail shakers in a corporate bookstore with its own line of bottled water has been my life long dream.  Go me!
