      I've just been thinking of revising the lyrics to my debut single (perhaps I'll post a draft - if someone reading this wants me to, leave a comment), when I sought inspiration in another song.  Now, as soon as I thought of a pop song to take ideas from, I thought only one thing.  Busted.  Inserting their debut album (their finest, and I can justify it being in my record collection as it was bought for me - it would surely be rude not to listen to it?) and skipping to 'Year 3000', I sat back and prepared for aural pleasure (innuendo most probably intended...).   I won't lie to you, listening to that song has probably given me a clue as to how Busted are so successful.  Think about it.  They've been to the Year 3000.  Do they not know the way the charts are going to pan out for the next 996 years?  Does this not grant them the surefire way to construct a song that will cater for the changing needs of the increasingly picky pop audience?  Or am I simply reading too far into this?  Only the future of Busted will tell...

      I've just realised the overwhelming burden of pressure, both from the expectations of myself and others, to succeed. I would say I can't sleep because of it, but its only 11.44am, so what the hell.

      What is in a name?  They give us an identity, something people can call us, to distinguish us from the rest of the mob - unless of course you're in a mob of people with the same name as you, but thats statistically unlikely, isn't it? Of course,with a debut single in the pipeline, my thoughts must turn to my name.  Is Robert Pook (my full name, to those who may read this blog and know me only as Rob) a jazzy name, full of the sparkling pizazz associated with showbiz, parties and the luxurious lifestyle of someone famous.  In short, it isn't.  Now, I'm not a group, so that rules out the pluralular (probably made that up...) style of name such as Westlife, 5ive, even the Spice Girls.  No, I need something short, punchy, something that hundreds of thousands of childrens can utter across their school playgrounds as soon as the new charts are announced, or following my appearance in Smash Hits magazine.  Darius.  Look at that, a successful popstar known only by his first name.  But Robert just doesn't have that ring, nor does Rob, Bob, Bert, just about anything that can be made using my humble little name.  I would go for Pook, it has been a nickname of mine for many years.  I say a nickname...its just my surname, so I guess it doesn't really work as a nickname of such.  But surely Pook corners me in as a performer aimed at the preschool category.  I want to have some credibility as a popstar, not be thought of as some bloke in a brightly coloured rotund costume who dances around singing old nursery rhymes but with the new politically correct lyrics.  All together now..."Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.  All the Legal Aid Companies and Lawyers to boot, ensured he got compensated with plenty of loot!". Perhaps I'll just change my name entirely?  Ramon, Diego, Carlos...something continental.  Ramon Valera...that could corner a market if I work on my dark, latin-based smouldering good looks?  You see, this is the trouble of the market.  I don't just need to be a good musician, in fact, I don't need to be a musician at all - which is rather good as far as I'm concerned.  No, all I need to be is a package.  An image, a look, a name.  ...this should be fun.

      Now, we come to the effective 'construction' of my debut single, my first stab at the heart of pop stardom.  Continuing this analagy further, if I succeed, I will find my hands immersed in the warm scarlet blood of fame.  If I fail, I'll just hit the pancreas, joining many other failed acts such as One True Voice (where did it all go wrong?), Fast Food Rockers (I think we can see where that one went wrong) and Daphne and Celeste (see previous brackets).  Whilst this may not knock the Pop Industry dead, it will simply cause a minor injury, slowing it down, flagging it.  Like a wounded wildebeest, falling back in the moving herd - prime targets for the lions, the other genres such as Rock and Hip Hop.  Now, time for some cold hard facts.  My debut single will be self-financed (hence my profile listing my occupation as 'non-profit' - I expect none whatsoever).  It will be a preliminary batch of 50 copies.  Hopefully, these will sell, and possibly fetch me up to Â£20 profit for charity.  With any luck, I will join the vast swathing ranks of the Charity Single Superstars.  Think Geldof, Bono, Band Aid, S Club 7, Gareth Gates.  My name will join them in lights.  In theory.  And there'll be a video.  I already have a slight demo for the single.  Its entitled 'The One Who Proposed'.  As you may imagine, its about being the one who proposed, but being rejected.  The lyrics are, if I say so myself, jaunty, a little streetwise, a la Busted.  The demo was written, performed and recorded in one live take (after many hours practising alone in a darkened room) using only a basic laptop and a twelve year old keyboard.  Now, we come to the crucial stages.  Over the next few days, I need to jazz it up, give it that extra something.  We need a brass section, an unnecessarily long percussion intro, a synthesized middle-8 in which I can arse around in during the promotional video, we need a dance routine...  ...more will follow.
