       So I woke up around noon today and felt hungry. I got on my bike and went down to the Subway which is about a block away (which is weird because almost everything in this town is a block from my house). Anyway I walked in and had to wait about 15 minutes because some damn soccer team just happened to pick the subway I was going to instead of the hundred other restaurants available. After that I ordered my usual turkey sandwich, with cucumbers, lettuce, green peppers, and American cheese. Everything was fine (except for the soccer team making me wait). So I sit down to eat and on the radio was this horrible country song. I mean I have heard some bad ones before but this one takes the cake. It was called "Rough and Ready" by some guy (wasnt really paying attention to who made this embarrassment to music). I thought, who would play country music on their own will? Then I remember the 55 year old lady who made my sandwich. It would make sense that she would turn this crap on because I remember her calling me "Hun" and she sounded as if she smoked a lot. I can't even believe I sat through the entire thing without killing someone. You can always tell who the manager is because they have control over the radio. In this case I was saddened to find out that the manager liked country music.

      Well I just got back from a trip to illinios to this leadership camp like thing( apparently my parents think I need "leadership skills") anyway, its this thing where you go to Illinois University to learn about how to interview people, set goals, and all tha stuff. I was in this program for 4 days. It was a three hour drive down there. When I got there I went up to my dorm and found out I had 2 room mates (Paden and Will). Obviously I had no idea what these 2 guys were like. I was the first to arrive so I just sat in the prison like dorm. After about half an hour Will finally showed up. He looked liked an easy going guy and he was really cool to talk to. Then cam Paden, a short scrawny,pale, guy who paced around all over the place and had a Star Trek T-shirt......enough said. I mean this guy would change in the closet. Hes one of those guys who always went into the stall in the guys locker room because he felt insecure about himself or something. The first day was long and boring speech by this guy named Steve Anderson, some sort of motivational speaker.&nbsp; The second day was a bit more interesting when I met the guys who were dormed next door to me, will, and paden. Their names were Patrick and Luke. Patrick came straight from Chicago suburbs and Luke was a pyro&nbsp;from Ocala Florida. The four of us (Pat,Me,Will, and Luke) all became good friends during the course of the program. The 2nd and 3rd day this goth girl named Marianna seemed to follow me around (apparently she was obssessed with me...just my luck). Anyway since I'm nice I talked to her and listened to her dispite the teasing from Pat. The 4th day she asked "Does witchcraft scare you?" and I responded "No, because personally I think its bullshit and not real."&nbsp; At the time she was talking to her friend Jackie on her cell phone. I said "If witchcraft is real then you can curse me."&nbsp; Well, her friend on the phone said she was a witch and that her and marianna had this coven of witchs and they did do curses and "spells" together. So then Marianna says " Ok, but I will need a bit of your hair and a article of your clothing that you have had for over a month." At this point I kind of laughed and got some some of my hair out with a knife and then gave her&nbsp; a plain grey shirt I had had for awhile. I guess if I start to cry blood or anything then witchcraft is real. The last day we had a awards ceremony, you know, one of those things where you get called up if you did something special or stood out in some way. Anyway, this guy named Sean had a accoustic guitar and was playing it into the mic before the awards started, then he asked the crowd "Are there any other guitar players out there?" and of course everyone pointed to me because I had already told people about my band. So I went up there and played a Tenacious D song (Kielbasa)&nbsp;and a Red Hot Chili Peppers song (Californiacation...is the spelling right on that?). After I was done I got a huge applause and everyone stood up and clapped and yelled. After that everyone gave me notes saying how cool it was and how "awesome" I was on guitar. I played infront of about 100 people so I guess its kind of like a gig. Anyway I had a good time dispite the occasional moments of boredom from speakers.

      Today I saw Spiderman 2. I thought this movie was kickass and better than the first one. Plus, from what I hear, the game isn't half bad either. I also met a guy named Chris, who plays guitar and lead vocals in a metal band near Chicago.&nbsp; Hes cool because he likes old metal and doesnt wear tight leather, and thats damn cool in my book. The good thing is he hates Numetal, for which I am thankful. Tomorrow I am going down to my grandfathers to trim bushes and do some landscaping stuff (you know, because I'm so caring).&nbsp; I will have to leave on Tuesday to go visit cousins in Illinois for three days. Another bit of random news, my grandfather turns 100 years old on the 24th. Which no one would probably care less about but hey its my blog. I will also be trying to get my mom's digital camera working so I can take some pictures of places/people and the general hell in which I live.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Song of the Day: "Man In the Box" by Alice In Chains &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Soda Fountain Suicides News: Still working on Judith, met a girl named Alison who knows our drummer Jon Kenny, when I asked her how she knew him she said "ya no, i dont remember". She lives all the way in Alabama.

      Today I was out driving to the TA to get some lunch and hopefully a discount on my food because of my "connections" there (aka bill). I glanced toward the radio just praying that there might actually be a good song on the radio ( which is nearly impossible with all this rap and pop shit, and  rap is not music). Anyway I turned on the radio only to find that "Stacy's Mom" or whatever the name is playing. I listened to half of it and wanted to drive the car off the highway out of sheer depression because of the level of the pure shit I was listening to. This song sounds almost exactly like some rip off of some Beatles song. I mean this is the kind of shit that kids in 5th grade headbang to. It seems that most the music in the past 4 or 5 years has sucked ultimate ass. Except the last Rage Against the Machine concert in 2000. I mean if you listen to this song, it has a pretty sick concept if you ask me, about some guy who goes out with this chick only to get a look at her mom which is probably some middle aged person? And please, refrain from giving me all this " oh, thats not what its about" shit. I get enough of that crap on my normal internet. One reason or another I vote that this song is just some "one hit wonder" from a band who I have heard nothing of except for this one song thats giving them their 5 minutes of fame.  On another note, I would like anyone who is reading this to please check out my friend Reb's blog at  urlLink      Song of the Day:  "Outshined" by Soundgarden   Soda Fountain Suicide News: None to be posted yet, look for more in a later post I might do today.

      Well its about 1:00 in the morning and I'am making this blog because im bored with chugging pop and eating Fritos. My goal for this blog is to post news about Music and my favorite bands along with other useless shit I feel like putting on here. I will also be posting news about the local band I'am in : The Soda Fountain Suicides and our quest to get gigs. If you live in the Berrien County area and are having a party or something give us a ring and we will play for whatever you decide is fair. If you are serious about it then come on down to Bridgman and ask for Neal and I will try to get you in for one of our practices so you can decide for yourself. Now that my pathetic attempt to advertise is over, I would also like to say that if you find any spelling/grammatical errors on this blog then you can just shut the hell up because I really dont give a damn. For every posting be sure to check out the "song of the day" section and the "Soda Fountain Suicides News".   Song of the Day: "Shatter" by From Autumn to Ashes  Soda Fountain Suicides News: Jon (the drummer) has finally finished baseball so we might be able to practice again. Hannah( bass player) has decided to let her boy friend play bass for us since she is so busy. Jon and I are going to suggest to Bill (frontman and lead guitar) that we cover the A Perfect Circle song "Judith".

      "You know how some people say they would regret the tattoos they get when they're older? Well, I was thinking, if I had a piece of toast [tattooed] around my butthole, when I get hemorrhages when I was older it'd only fit the tattoo image even more, appearing as if I had jelly on my toast... and it only gets better from there..."  ***silence***  ".....You watch the game last night?"  "No."  ".......'s a good game."  "Who played?"  "You know.. I don't remember."

             "The first time I heard Nirvana, it was a classic record-store experience, which is something that is becoming increasingly rare these days. I walked into Rocks in Your Head in New York and asked the woman behind the counter,"What's new?" She put on "Smells like Teen Spirit." I thought,"Wow. Somebody managed to combine R.E.M. with Metallica." I had never heard the term Grunge, and I didn't know that I was going to be a phenomenon. I just knew I was listening to something profound: a great piece if music. Kurt Cobain captured the idea of having incredibly powerful feelings about having no feelings. I do believe Cobain was perfect, in a way: He was perfectly flawed."

      Well I woke up today and made my usual trip to subway. Of course I had to endure the country music again. After that I went down to the park where the "skatepark" use to be. No one was there. Then I went down the street to my house. No one was there. I had heard they moved the skatepark close to town hall mostly to discourage stoners from clogging up the park. Town hall. No one was there. Does everyone just magically disappear on Wednesdays or something? Yes, Bridgman is working its evil on me. First, I'm starting to like Emo ( which is socially unacceptable ). And second I have nothing better to do than to post on my useless blog.  Does anyone know if Live Journal has free photo hosting? I need to know the answer for my quest to discover what is truly better, blog or live journal. Live Journal seems like more of a pain when trying to get started, but odes it give free photo hosting? I dont know. Anyone interested in anthropomorphism?    Song of the Day:  "A Grain of Salt" by Poison the Well
