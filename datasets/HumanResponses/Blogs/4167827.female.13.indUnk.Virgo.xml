      YAY! 3 Days til I'm 14 ^.^ Oh oh oh oh oh!! Here's a new word! Hayaboosamoogio.. I think it means person with no idea... Sai made it up. Oh! And there's also Chinchillasnats, James made that one =). I got back from my canoe trip yesterday... At least I think it was yesterday. I saw a TON of people that I havn't seen in a loooong time. I made new friends and I learned a LOT the time I was there. Unfortunatly, it was very cold on the trip.. haha, here's a quote I'll never forget. In the tent, during like, the middle of the night, Christal rolled over and she was like "Jenna... are you awake?" "Yep.." "I have hypothermia... No wait.. If I had hypothermia, then I'd be warm" Heehee.. That's always great. That's where I became friends with Lois. And I saw Christie, Christie-Ann(e), Christie, Amy, Lisa, Esther, Karina, Christal, Yo (aka Tim aka Banana), and there were like, 2 other Tims.. and there was also James, Jenna, Erica, Pack-Pack, Alex, Keywatin, Ken, Steve, Ben, Curtis, Chris, and... Kara, Kathy, Kimberly, Caleb, Wade, Kyle... and I can't remember anyone else right now. Anyway, James and Steve made a DVD of the trip, so yeah, that's awesome! =)  Thought of the day: I most likely won't get a Chinchilla for my birthday.

A bunch of friends of mine are going too, so it's gonna be so awesome! I don't know how many days it is... I don't keep track of current affairs :P And I don't have any clean laundry... So I gotta wash it tomorrow and dry it before I leave lol, so I gotta get up real early.. I'm kinda bored.. Just telling everyone that I'm gonna be gone a few days... Lol, last time I went, everyone got sunburnt SO bad :P including me.. and I got a nice tan.. woot =) and... my birthday is like, in 9 days! =) but school is coming up soon, and I'm starting a new school..

My cold is going away slowly, but I still don't feel the best... Ah, well, I visited Tynera today, and I havn't seen her since like, school got out.. and I babysat a girl who's really cool... And I had a nice talk with a really good friend of mine. (Not that anyone cares, lol) Hmm... Oh yeah, I saw a friend I've known all my life, but she moved, and then she moved back... so yeah =) hmm... And I'm very content =) =) =) so yepperz... That's all, and goodnight =)

      Hey! Nothing new here... I'm still sick... I've gotten a lil better, but yeah. Most friends of mine are being jerks... and unfortunatly, I talked to too many of "those" people. I can't really go anywhere because I'd probably give everyone my cold... and because I've been online so much, there's not much to talk about anymore. I miss everyone =( and there's nothing to do... *sigh* I'm Bored. I hope I get better soon or else I wouldn't be able to go on a canoe trip with a ton of people I know from all over... That's in about a week :\ Ah, well we'll see. I'll sign off now.

      Hey! Sup? =P My Birthday's coming up! Woot! ^.^ Unfortunatly, so is school =( so I'm kinda happy and sad at the same time. By the way, my name is Jenna, but my online friends call me Pengy... and my friends in real life call me Jedda or Jen or Ear or whatever they want to call me =P. Right now, I have a cold *sniff* and I'm bored... because I can't go anywhere and I miss all my friends cause I havn't seen most of them... =( *sighs* oh well... This Is Summer.

      Hii! Well it's my first entry... First of all, Who am I? Good question, eh? Well... as you can probably see, Ear is everywhere on my site. Am I obsessed with ears? Lets hope not... Actually, it says Ear because I couldn't think of any other name that I could use. Ear is my middle name backwards (Rae, if you havn't figured it out) and it is the name that my brother calls me. I am unfortunatly not very creative but -- oop.. suppertime... bad timing to start this :P You'll get to know me for the past ... however long it takes for me to make this. So peace out.
