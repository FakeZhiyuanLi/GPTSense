      &nbsp; When I talked to Joe last night I sooo wanted to tell him about my trip to MIA in August.&nbsp; I absolutley hate keeping things from him, but I wasn't ready to tell him just yet.&nbsp; I don't want the realtionship like my parents have where they hide things from one another.&nbsp; I'll let him know when it gets closer to the 21st.&nbsp; I talked with Rebecca last night about what I should do b/c she knows the situation better than anyone and I always value her opinion.&nbsp; She wanted to get a guy's opinion so she ran by the sanario by her fiance.&nbsp; Which he said that if Joe has trusting issues and I can get away with not telling him then don't.&nbsp; B/c it'll be a big drama-fest if I tell him.&nbsp; On the other hand, if I don't tell him and he finds out then Joe will be double-pissed that I kept it from him. &nbsp;&nbsp; For example, when Rebecca and I went to NO last month we got hammered and I ended up flashing this total stranger on Bourbon St.&nbsp; I've never flashed before and it was fun.&nbsp; I don't regret it.&nbsp; But when I told Joe about it he flipped and still flips over me doing that.&nbsp; He doesn't undstand that me and my girl were out on Bourbon drinking having a blast and I did it for fun.&nbsp; The what he is thinking is 'why would she do something like that to please another guy? A total stranger too.&nbsp; What else would she do when I'm not around?'&nbsp; But I don't see it like that at all.&nbsp; Which I'm glad that I left out the little detail that the guy I flashed had a movie camera.&nbsp; LOL! &nbsp;&nbsp; As a side note on me visiting Lewis in MIA, I don't say a word when he visits Shannon in Mobile.&nbsp; Sometimes he stays overnight.&nbsp; I totally trust him.&nbsp; I don't get invited to go over there with him no do I? Nope.&nbsp; So that is my defense.&nbsp; I'm going, and I'm going to have fun for a weekend.&nbsp; And I am  NOT  getting as drunk as I was when I went to NO.&nbsp; What  will  blow though, it that my plane out of FLL leave at like 6am and I have to work from 2p-1030p so that will be one long motherfucking day for me! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mom passed her CDL test this morning so she's now an official school bus driver.&nbsp; Which I'm really proud of her b/c she studied her ass off for this bus course.&nbsp; The hardest I've seen her study since she went for the realtor liscense back in the 90's.&nbsp; I went with her to fill out the paperwork and stuff and I poked fun at her saying that she'll get stuck on the short bus. Like I said, I'm proud of her but riding with her this morning while she ran her errands was like pulling teeth or something! I mean, we were in her car and the speed limit is 45 mph on the road and I look and we are going like 38 or 40 mph.&nbsp; I told her that we weren't carrying Nitros in the back to push the pedal and go the speed limit.&nbsp; I think that class made her lose her nerve of something.  &nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Today was my last day at TRX.&nbsp; I felt like it was my birthday or something the way that people&nbsp;kept coming up to me.&nbsp; I'm glad that I traded email addresses with some of the people that I liked to work with there.&nbsp; But I'm happy that I have moved on to greener pastures and greener paychecks.&nbsp; That guy that I email at work all day, I doubt I'll ever talk to him again.&nbsp; He and I didn't have much of a strong friendship but at least he was good for something.&nbsp; What was that something you wonder?&nbsp; I mentioned that I was trying to find some cheap airfares to go see my girl Pepper in EWR or my friend Lewis in MIA.&nbsp; He sent me to  urlLink http://www.southwest.com &nbsp;and believe it or not, I found a ticket for $102!&nbsp; It has the perfect flight schedule too.&nbsp; Yeah, so I have to fly out of MSY, which is 3 and a half hours away but c'mon now....$102! After taxes too!&nbsp; I haven't flown since 1999 so I'm really excited.  &nbsp;&nbsp; I had a   HUGE    issue with whether or not to buy the ticket because of how Joe would react if he found out.&nbsp; We already know that he has problems trusting people and he admitted that sometimes he gets jealous, so how would he react if I told him that I was going to visit my friend.&nbsp; Now I should also advise that Lewis and I used to date.&nbsp; We went out for like 2 years, I think, but I broke up with him in early 2002 b/c I couldn't stand his ass anymore.&nbsp; And ever since then he and I have been good friends.&nbsp; Completely innocent, platonic, all that good stuff.

      &nbsp; So I just got a call from my Aunt Julie who is in Las Vegas for a hairdresser convention.&nbsp; She does hair and also nails. She said that her and her friends were lying my pool at Mandalay Bay and it is 110 degrees.&nbsp; I guess that makes sense since LAS is 2 hours behind my time.&nbsp; She is pregnant with her first and I'm really happy for her.&nbsp; Julie said she bought a maternity bathing suit that has a skirt on it.&nbsp; I remember my Grandma(her mom) wearing the same type of old lady bathing suit so we got a chuckle out of that.  &nbsp;&nbsp;   So why is it that everyone is in LAS but me?  &nbsp; I want to go damnitt!&nbsp; But I can't afford a damn thing at the moment.&nbsp; I called AT&T to see if they'd remove the roaming charges on my cell bill and I got her to reduce it by half.&nbsp; So I was glad.&nbsp; I upgraded to the National Plan she called it.&nbsp; She said that the whole US is my home area now.&nbsp; It was the same price but for only 450 mins where I currently have 600 mins.&nbsp; But that was worth it.&nbsp; Now all I have to do is split the numbers between me and B and it'll be cake!  &nbsp; As I said I'm on a tight budget but temptation is  everywhere. &nbsp; This week is Tax-Free week on clothes for back to school, I got a $50 gift certificate from the jewelry store, my fave store  urlLink http://www.newyorkandcompany.com/ NY&C is have 50% off jeans and I have a 20% off coupon from them.&nbsp; I want to stop in there and see if they have some essentials for my new office job. I'll prolly do that on Friday.&nbsp; Why can't I win the lottery or something??  &nbsp; Mom said that she would treat me to NO this weekend and I wouldn't have to pay her back.&nbsp; She guarenteed me that we would be back home Sunday afternoon since me, her, and Lena all have to work Monday morning.&nbsp; I still don't know though.&nbsp;  Fuck it, I'm going.   &nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow is my last day at TRX.&nbsp; I have gathered several of my homegirls' emails to keep in touch so that's super sweet.&nbsp; I think I might actually wear my contacts tomorrow..  LOL  (I never wear them during the week bc I'm too tired at 630a to put them in)

      &nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot believe that the A/C in the office is broken.&nbsp; When I got to work this morning I thought I was in some tropical metal rainforest.&nbsp; The team leads turned off 80% of the overhead lights to keep the heat down.&nbsp; Maybe it's all the bodies jabbering away on the phones that is makeing the room hotter, not the stupid lights.&nbsp; But whatever, I'm not the boss.&nbsp; The janitor brought in some fans and it's just now cooling off.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it was the heat that was making me so lethargic or maybe that tomorrow is my last day here.&nbsp; I still gave customer service but for handle times, break schedules, station percentage, I could give a rat's ass.&nbsp; God, it feels good not to give a shit at work! I will sincerely miss some of the people that I work with, especially my girl B and the ghetto queen Carla, but other than those 2 most of the people there can kiss my ass. &nbsp; I've been emailing this guy that works upstairs in my office ever since I got out of AA Ticketing training.&nbsp; But that's okay b/c it's completely innocent and he seems cool and I don't feel guilty for making a guy friend from work. At work I talked with my friends David and Jon and Joe knew about them.&nbsp; Only because I would talk about funny things that happened at work and they were included.&nbsp; Is it me or am I trying to justify myself for making a new friend?&nbsp; My girl B put it in perspective for me(as usual) saying that it's innocent and that Joe has his girl friend in Mobile.&nbsp;  omg okay I have to rant on this workforce ho Tara.&nbsp; First, she has highlights in her brown hair but it looks like she got grey not blonde. Then she totally shakes her hips and ass when she walks.&nbsp; I mean if I saw her walk like that in public then I would think that she was def out Cruising for the Cock.&nbsp; She seems like the type of person that will smile at you then steal you bike 5 mins later.&nbsp; I signed off the phone this morning b/c I was trying to find out why the TL's were turning off all the GD lights and I was asking Carla about it and my TL came around the corner and told me that Tara told on me for being off the phone.&nbsp; Fucking useless bitch.&nbsp; AND her and another WF chick spent most of their days this summer calling into radio stations to win concert tickets and free meals.&nbsp; MAN I wish I could sit by the radio and call in to win free shit but see, some people in this office WORK and we are the ones that don't reep any bennys from it. Anyways I think I have milked the clock long enough...Until later

      &nbsp; Man, it felt good to leave work at lunch today.&nbsp; I had to leave early to go get a drug test done for my new job.&nbsp; The last time I took a drug test was back in 2001 and I couldn't go when I got there.&nbsp; I guess there is some regulation that a person has to wait 30mins in between each pee attempt.&nbsp; I was there for like over an hour. &nbsp; I was not going through that shit again.&nbsp; So I drank all morning long and held it until I left work at noon.&nbsp; It wouldn't have been that bad if&nbsp; the lab place I went to in Pensacola did drug screenings!! The HR lady at Navy gave me a list of Labs I could go to in Pcola and they would take care of it.&nbsp; Well, I go to the hospital, which was the closest one, and I wait 15mins for the nurse to finish lunch then she looks at my papers and said "Oh no, we don't drug screen at this location."&nbsp; Fucking great, eh?&nbsp; So she calls the HR lady and leaves her a msg saying that the location doesn't drug screen.&nbsp; The nurse said I was the second person that came in. &nbsp; I'm about to piss my pants by this point.&nbsp; The nurse gives me directions to the next lab office and&nbsp; by the time I get there I wait another 15mins, then another 5 while that nurse files the paperwork.&nbsp; By the time I get to the potty and let it go I was in and out of there in 5 mins flat.&nbsp; I was relieved (no pun intended) that it didn't take me long.&nbsp; I don't pee on comand very well. &nbsp;&nbsp; My guy left for his flight to Vegas this morning.&nbsp; I can't believe he will be gone a whole month!&nbsp; I guess this is good practice for Korea.&nbsp; Shouldn't be too hard though.&nbsp; When he went on leave and visited his brother and family in June,&nbsp;I think he was gone for a month as well.&nbsp; I still may sneak away to his apt for a weekend if my parents threaten my sanity.&nbsp; Which is very likely.&nbsp; I'll miss him but I have a lot of crap around the house that I can keep busy with. &nbsp;&nbsp; Only 2 more days then I'll be done with my crappy job forever!! &nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp; As I was driving to my boyfriend's apartment, not knowing if he had returned or not, I got a call from my Mom and her friend Lena and invited me to hang at Lena's condo on Pensacola Beach until Joe called.&nbsp; I was still upset that he hadn't called me at all and was still worried that he was going to get 'cold feet' and break up.&nbsp; So I had my convertable top down and out of paranoria I kept looking at my cell phone that I put in my cup holder, just willing him to call and tell me what is going on.&nbsp; I kept looking down every other minute for 30 minutes until finaly I realized that I was being stupid and in spite of myself and screamed at the top of my lungs to stop looking at the phone that he wasn't going to call.  &nbsp;&nbsp; So of course he called 5 minutes later.&nbsp; I met him at his apartment and he told me that he never saw his friend in Mobile.&nbsp; He went to her house but she didn't come home after her class so he took off and spent the evening in New Orleans.&nbsp; He said that he was disapointed that he couldn't get in contact with her but he liked the spontaneousness of driving to NO on a whim.&nbsp; Said he got a room at a Hampton between NO and Mobile.&nbsp; I told him that I wasn't upset that he went to NO without me, I said that I was upset that he didn't call me at all.&nbsp; He said that he knew I was upset but needed to get away and think about things.&nbsp; That he needed a change of scenery.&nbsp; Which I understand completely.&nbsp; I told him that I was scared for our relationship that it was on the rocks and he said that he was working out his communication and trust issues and that he wasn't thinking of ending our relationship.  &nbsp; To make a long story short, all that nervousness and beating myself over not talking to him was for nothing.&nbsp; And I'm glad.&nbsp; I'm glad that for once in my life I care about someone more than myself.&nbsp; I have finaly found the love that I have read about in books and see on movies.&nbsp; I would marry this man in a hearbeat and I would wait for him forever.&nbsp; As long as I had my BOB with me, naturally.&nbsp; A girl's got to get her cookie without her man somehow!  &nbsp; Joe is leaving for Las Vegas tomorrow morning and I'm staying with him tonight.&nbsp; Tomorrow I have to leave work early to go get a piss test for my Navy Fed job.&nbsp; I hate those damn drug tests.&nbsp; Not because I'm worried that I'll test postive, I'm worried because I have bad aim and end up pissing all over my hand and as you know you can't wash or anything until they file and mark your cup.&nbsp; It's utterly disgusting but if that's what I have to do to make 4 dollars more on the hour for this job then so be it.  Another shitty thing that happened to me this weekend is that my cell phone bill came in via my email.&nbsp; Not that it's my cell phone bill but it's the fact that while my friend and I went to NO in June for my birthday we used my cell because I have free night and weekends.&nbsp; Well, I didn't see any roaming indicator on my display panal so all is well right?&nbsp;  Fuck no! &nbsp; It was .69 for every connecting call then .60 for every minute.&nbsp; My bill came out to be $168.92 where it's only $50.00 a month!!!! I about shat myself.&nbsp; I am going to call AT&T and tell them about not having an indictaor and if they won't remove the charge then I'm going to have to add up my numbers and my friends numbers.&nbsp; I'm going to hate bringing this to her because I know that she's been down lately but there's no way I can cover both.&nbsp; Switching jobs has already fucked up my finances.&nbsp; I'm going to call AT&amp;T tomorrow and hopefully get it resolved.  Fuck!

      My girlfriend(girl friend?) Rebecca told me how much she likes writing in her blog for stress relief.&nbsp; I said "What the fuck is a 'blog'?"&nbsp; The next thing you know, I skimmed through hers and created my own.&nbsp; I have this journal that I have had since college that I wrote in like every week to vent my thoughts and other things.&nbsp; I liked that journal.&nbsp; I bought it a Hot Topic for like $2 and it is purple and has a picture of a New-Orleans type cemetary on the cover.&nbsp; But enough of that stuff let me say what I have to say for my first entry. My boyfriend Joe took off yesterday to visit his friend Shannon in Mobile, AL.&nbsp; They are good friends and she told him that her mother is losing her feet due to her diabetes.&nbsp; I have diabetes too and so Joe flipped out because he said that I don't eat right or excersize enough.&nbsp; Anyway, he went to Mobile to visit and he is supposed to be back today.&nbsp; At lunch yesterday I called him to tell him that I got the job at Navy Federal and he was happy for me but I could tell that there was somethign bugging him.&nbsp; I asked him if he wanted to talk about it and he said no.&nbsp; I asked him point blank if he was thinking of breaking up and he was surprised that I asked him that and said that no he wasn't thinking about breaking up.&nbsp; So I asked him to call me later that night he said he would.&nbsp; Joe never called.&nbsp;  Today I am going over to his apartment to face the music.&nbsp; Here are things I want to say to him:&nbsp; I want to tell him that it hurts me that he doesn't share his love for his motorcylce with me anymore.&nbsp; It hurts me that he doesn't introduce me to his friends.&nbsp; It hurts me that when he goes to Korea(he is in the Air Force) he thinks I'm going to cheat on him.&nbsp; We have been dating for almost a year and I feel like he doesn't know me.&nbsp; I feel taken for granted and unappreciated.&nbsp; The only time I felt that he truly appreciated me was when I cleaned his whole apartment top to bottom for his birthday on July 16.&nbsp; He doesn't own a mop and I didn't have money to buy one, so I got on my hands and knees and scrubbed his kitchen floor , Cinderella style.&nbsp; He thanked me that whole weekend for cleaning.&nbsp; Said it was the best birthday present he ever received. He has been so independent and out on his own for so many years.&nbsp; The only family that he has is his older brother and his family.&nbsp; Being the stubborn and independent soul that he is I never tell him what to do.&nbsp; Maybe he needs that.&nbsp; Maybe he needs someone to be clingy and possessive with him.&nbsp; I don't care that he goes out with his friends on their bikes when I leave to go home.&nbsp; But I do care when he comes up to me Sunday afternoon asking what time I'm leaving. I sent Joe a text message this morning that said "call me when you leave.&nbsp; If you want"&nbsp; No reply.&nbsp; I called him on my way home from breakfast with my mom and it went straight to voicemail.&nbsp; Which means he has his cell phone turned off or he doesn't have service.&nbsp; I would like to think that he turned off his cell phone when he was riding back to his apartment from Mobile.&nbsp; You know, it takes a hell of a lot of trust for&nbsp;me in him to let him go&nbsp;to visit his female friend then for him to be worried that I'm going to mess around while he is TDY.&nbsp; LIke I said, today is when I'm going to face the music.

           I include in this blog some thoughts that I have written down throughout the day today on the pickle that I have gotten myself into with my boyfriend Joe.  The notes in this entry will be scattered and more like a sketchpad of sorts.  Enjoy         So here goes:      The following is an exerpt I wrote to my good friend Chris who lives in Austin.        Do I have some drama that I created for myself.  This is a long story so prepare yourself.  Sit down, relax, have a taco or 2....so here goes.This guy Lewis and I dated for like 2 years long distance b/c i live here and he lives in Miami.  So I broke up with him in 2002 and last year we just started chatting.  Basically about how you doin whats going on, etc.  So when I met Joe and started dating him, Lewis and I still kept in touch like once a month.  I was over at Joes sometimes when he would call and I'd keep the convo short and I told Joe that Lewis was an ex but now the relationship is friends.  So he was cool with that.  To make a long story short, I told Lewis not to call me on the weekends b/c that was my time with Joe so he and I would chat during weekdays.  As you know, Joe is in Las Vegas on an air force assignment for this entire month.One day while I was at work..at my old job, I was looking for plane tickets to fly from Pcola to Vegas and visit.  Well the prices were out of my league so I decided that I still wanted to fly somewhere so I looked up prices to Newark to Nashville and Miami.  I found a $100 to fly to Miami and on a whim I bought it.  So of course as time went on I knew that I was going to have to tell Joe about me flying to Miami for the weekend while he is away.I told him last night and well, he was hurt and upset.  His track record with girlfriends, they have all cheated on him with there "guy friends" so he said that he has red flags popping up everywhere.  So do you think I was wrong to buy the ticket spontaneously like that? I explained to Joe that I'm not visiting Lewis its just I wanted to travel somewhere and the ticket was hella cheap and I know someone there so free room and board.  Oh Yeah, Lewis is house sitting his friend's 3 bedroom house so I'll be in 1 of the bedrooms.Lemme know your insight on this and I'm going to put this and other thoughts in my blog tonight.As a side note, Joe and I hung up the phone on good terms.  He said that he really really misses me and wants to come home so bad.  He told me that he needs to know that I want him and that I need him.  Of course I do!  So I told him that in the sincerest way possible.  I think he believes that I'm rejecting him in some way.  I told him that I've never cheated on a bf before and I sure as hell isn't going to start with teh love of my life!       The following is an email I sent myself to enter into my blog tonight.       So I told Joe about me going to Miami this weekend.  I knew that he was going to be very upset but I had bought the ticket earlier in the month so the only other option was to not go and eat the thing.  But I wanted to go, still want to go.  Joe got upset and was hurt.  He feels like I'm rejecting him to fly across the state to visit another guy.  And not some guy, a guy that I had a physical relationship with.  I can see his point.  I wanted Joe to see mine that I don't see Lewis in that light anymore.  I see him as a platonic friend.  Lewis and I both agreed that we make better friends than we did as a couple.  The friendship is completely innocent and there is no physical or emotional attraction there at all.  To be honest, I can't talk to Lewis on the phone for very long b/c the guy is so fucking long winded I have to interupt and be like "well that's cool.  So anyways, I gotta go it's getting late.  Talk with you later." Click. Joe said that he has been cheated on with 4 other girlfirneds with their 'platonic guy friends' so he said he's been down this road before.  I told him that I'm not like the other chicks.  I told him that I would never leave him or cheat on him ever.  I hope that he believes that.  I told Joe how much I need him and want him in my life that he was the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.  Of course I couldn't help but feel like a complete asshole and I was ashamed that I hurt Joe the way that I did.  I shouldn't have bought the ticket but Joe wasn't here this month and I didn't want to be stuck at home with the parents every weekend in August        The following is a snippet of Chris' response that I just recieved:      I'm very much like you, I keep in touch with some of my ex's and wouldlove to visit them to see what's up every now and then.  The onlyproblem is my girlfriend doesn't believe that guys and girls can be"just friends".  I've tried to tell her time and time again, I'M A GOODGUY! But she still goes off her asshole-lowlife-cheating-exboyfriends.To be honest with you, it pisses me off and insults me that I'm comparedto the degenerates, but that's the only past she knows.Had I decided to leave town to san diego where my ex lives, sarahwould've birthed a fucking cow.  The only thing that would have poppedinto her mind is "while the cats away, the mice play".  I'm all aboutjen, I'm on your side with the whole story.  You told him before hefound out on his own, you've been honest with him about the wholesituation, and luckily he's understanding.  Unfortunatly, you flew to miami to visit an exboyfriend while he was outof town,  you stayed at the exboyfriends house, and I assume joe hasnever met this guy....this is gonna come around and bite you in the ass:(  maybe not next week or next month, but this was a warning to him andanything that makes him think you aren't faithful while he's over seaswill only be fueled by the miami trip.I can see where he'd feel uncomfortable about the whole situation, butits pretty obvious he loves you, otherwise he would have bitched youout, hung up the phone, and bought an anal-safe hooker.  At least that'swhat I would do ;)      And finaly the end result.......................         Joe and I talked tonight and to make a long story short, we aren't going to discuss my trip to Miami anymore and concentrate on his homecoming.He said that he wasn't giving up on our relationship and he doesn't want me to do things b/c I'm afraid that I'm going to upset him b/c he doesn't want to tell me what to do and shit.  I just really need him to come home already so I can look at him.    I think the best part of my day was early this afternoon when I got to spend time with my girl B.  She gave me a mani and pedi and made my nails look all clean and purty.  The exfoliating of my feet was the best though.  Even though when she was rubbing the balls and arches of my feet it really really tickled and I had to concetrate so hard not to bust up laughing like a little girl.  I think getting pedies will be a regular routine for me.

        The other night Joe and I were on the phone and we got onto the subject of me writing things and thoughts in my blog.  I told him that I wasn’t going to give him the address b/c he wouldn’t like what I wrote in there but it’s a place for me to rant and rave about things that are pissing me off.  He said that he’d rather not read it then and invade my privacy but I told him that I use Blogger but he wouldn’t find my username amongst the thousands possibly millions of users.  I trust him.  And if he does find my blog, fat chance, then I’ll have to kick his ass.      I was really hoping that Tropical Storm Bonnie would just reap through Pcola and I wouldn’t have to work.  But no, I woke up this morning and birds were chirping and the sun was shining. What the fuck is up with that??? Oh and check this out: If Navy Fed went to reduced operations (which means that if you are sched to work you don’t have to come in but if you do come into work then you get paid double overtime) then I wouldn’t have to go in and I’d still get paid Admin Leave.  How cool is that?  But like I said, the sun was out and I had to crawl my fat ass out of my warm bed and get ready for work.  Which really isn’t fare to complain b/c it is really hard work.  Just learning their P&P and products and computer programs.      So I’ve been slacking off on working out.  I have to admit this.  I went to work at 1145 on Tuesday and did the elliptical machine with this girl Jamy and then used the showers and stuff at work to get ready for work at 2pm.  I’m going to do that again tomorrow.  I need to get back in the 3 days a week regime like before.  I feel better on days that I work out.  I feel like I’m trying to get healthy and lose this fat.  Dedication and commitment are the issues I have.     So I’ve been avoiding my parents kinda.  It helps that when I get home the house is dark and I can chill out and get some private time.  I really want my own fucking apartment sooo bad.  Here is my current thoughts on this goal.  If I work nights I’ll be making an extra $300 a week and on weekends and OT etc I should be able to put some in my savings.  I’m also going to refinance my Mustang with Navy Federal so that will drop my payments and then allow me to put more into my savings.  I think a couple of paychecks I’ll be able to see where I stand.  I am also vowing not to open up any more department/jewelry credit cards.  Once I get my NY&C and Whitmans paid off then I’m closing them bitches up!  I’m also thinking of doing a Consolidation Loan to pay off my student loan and this one credit card that has a really high interest rate.  But I won’t be able to apply for that until my 6 month probation period at Navy is up.  Which will be in January!    Okay so it’s time to  get on the road and get to work.  They approved today for casual day so I’m in jeans and my Skechers.  Oohhhh right.    Peace out!

          Last night was my first time working the night shift in almost a year.  It wasn’t too bad though.  Around 8 and 9pm I started to get a bit tired and ready to go to bed.  But it’ll take time for me to get used to it.  I called Joe on my way home and he was with his boss and he couldn’t talk but he called me back like 10 mins later.  I miss him a lot and I don’t even want to think about how much I’m going to miss him when he goes to Korea.    Before I left for work yesterday I forgot to clean out my cat’s litter box and when I got up this morning Rich came it with an attitude and told me all about it.  I told him “ I don’t nit-pick on the shit that you don’t do or leave around the house” but like that did any good.  All this within the first hour of me waking up and I am not a morning person so, thanks to Rich my stepdad I'll be in a shitty mood all day.  So Mom was all pissed when she got home and said that the box needs to be spotless or else they are kicking me out.  Nice huh?  So yeah I admit that I slack once n awhile but I like to do things on my own time.  I swear to God I am this close to selling my prized possession and getting an apartment.  I’ll never get another Mustang like that one again but like I said, I am this fucking close.  I’m going to see what my paychecks are like at Navy first.    Anyways, I’m glad that my friend Rebecca got a nail job in town.  I think I’m her first client on Monday.  That’ll be cool to sit around and BS with her. It’ll be like old times!   But I’m meeting this girl at the gym at work to workout before our shift and I have to leave in 10 mins and I’m still in my PJ’s.  I want to get out of this house ASAP so this will be a short entry.

      Note: Last night I tried to copy and paste this survey that is on Rebecca's blog but when I go to save it, the site logged me out again and I got extremely pissed off and shut down the computer. I had a pretty good today today. I spaced out in work more than usual but I got through it and did my 30 min workout to boot. For the past 2 days Joe and I have been trading dirty and adult-oriented text messages back and forth. I think it's fun to get him worked up over something I write while he is at work in Vegas. He told me the other night that he is afraid that when he goes to Korea that I won't be able to be "intimate on the phone" as he puts it. Excuse me for not feeling comfortable with doing the whole phone sex thing. I mean, it's not as stupid as cyber sex but I think it's pretty close. Then again, I don't think like a man. In my perspective it's more like "out of sight, out of mind". Joe says that women are programming with a switch that we can just flip off and on when we want to be in the mood for lovings. I can see where that is true for me b/c a lot of times I feel like I can go weeks without the big O. In all honesty, I doubt that I will get all horny and double-click my own mouse while he is away. Seriously. First, I have no fricking privacy to do that sort of thing with the parental units under the same roof. And second, I never really got into the whole self-pleasuring. Shit, it was over a year since I had sex when I met Joe. And I was perfectly fine with it. I think I was more concentrating on saving money and working. Which will be the same scenario when Joe goes away. I want to have at least most of my cards paid off when he returns and some money in the bank to help pay for our move . I just booked Joe and I a room at the Monaco in New Orleans for your 1 year aniversary next month. The hotel is having a travel agent special for buy 1 night get 1 free. My agent card is due to expire in Sept so I wanted to do something special for him. That hotel is the most beautiful hotel I've ever been in. I just texted Joe to call me so I can tell him what I did. I do have like this whole month to cxl the room if we can't go. I'm sure I'll have enough $$ saved to cover the room rate. If not, I'll cxl it. So anyways, I opened up an account with Navy today. Which on top of the services that my current bank already performs, with Navy I get free checks and my account gains interest. I asked the account manager about refinancing my car which is currently at 7-8% he said that I could refinance it for 2%!! I'm sooo looking into that soon. That damn car payment is killing me. I had to borrow $300 from Mom this month to cover my weekend NO trip and my car until I get back on my feet. But I'm tired and it's almost Friday. I can't wait to see what kind of "valuable prize" I get for graduation from NET class tomorrow. Peace out muh kneegrows!

      Last night I was able to sleep thru the entire night without waking up by Mom leaving for work or the cat crying or the fucking cuckoo clock. I absolutly LOATHE cuckoo clocks and I always shut it off when the parents arn't looking. I can't do anything else about it b/c Mom pulls the whole "it's my house" bullshit. I cannot WAIT to pull that shit with her when she comes to the house that Joe and I will buy. What goes around comes around. Speaking of Mom, today at work I ran into one of Mom's old co-workers from Dillard's. A li'l history:  In 2003 Mom was fired from Dillard's b/c she supposdly returned an item from a customer then  put  it back on the rack while the customer was looking for something to exchange it with. Anyways, the garment was marked down b/c it was on the inventory list of stuff to be reduced for season and the customer picked up the garment and Mom sold it to her with the marked down price . So anyways I run into the old co whose name is Joanne and she complements me on all the weight I lost and asked about Mom. I told her that Mom was a school bus driver now and she likes it. We BSd some more and I told her that me Mom and Lena went to NO past weekend and that it was fun but Lena smokes too much. So when I told Mom what I said she assumed that I told Joanne all about them getting stoned every day and night. In all honesty, I don't think I said anything about the weed b/c I was at work in the hallway, but I can't recall that a 100%. So when I walk in the door Mom busts my balls and said that if she gets random drug tested then its my fault.     Sidenote: I came back from dinner and finished this entry and I had like 6 paragraphs of thoughts entered but I go to publish it and the fucking thing said Session Expired and I had to relog in and my post is gone.  The only thing is left is from the stuff I wrote that I saved before eating.  Which is the paragraph you see above.  Fuck this I'm not rewriting it.

         Part 2 of this series is about what happened today @Navy and about tonight's thoughts on Joe.     My commute to Navy took longer than what I had expected.  And when I refer to Navy, I'm referring to the Navy Federal Credit Union in which I just started today.  I planned on getting to work like 10 mins to 8am so I could get a good seat and be prepared. But Pcola traffic had other plans for my schedule.  Anyways, I'm not going to blabber on about the job because my show "Airline" on A&E is fixing to come on.  The center there is huge and bamboo trees are growing right out of the ground inside!  There is a new gym, cafe, Sheriff's security there 24hrs, a nature trail, and a quiet room.  My fave room is the Quiet Room.  It's a room that has a small library with reference books and fiction that you can sign out and borrow.  I saw titles on public speaking, raising teenagers, and preparing for college.  The glass is soundproof and there are leather chairs and 2 Internet-able computers there.  It's completely peaceful.  But I think it could use one of those little fountains.  The word "Serene" and "Serenity" comes to mind when I'm in that area.    I'll be paying more for insurance than TRX.  Medical is $46 per paycheck and that could be b/c they done have EPO they just have PPO.  Oh well.  Today the class went through the bennys, policies, and we played Trivial Pursuit.  I saw my friend Kevin there as he was walking up the hallway.  Kevin was the one that told me about the opening.  My friend David and I are in the same class which I'm happy about.  I like David a lot and he and I were on the same wavelength when we were at TRX.  He is 20 years old, married, and has a son.  I'm glad that I have a friend in here going through training with me.  When I talked to Rebecca tonight I told her to submit her application and I would talk to HR on her behalf.  She told me that her credit isn't great but I told her that she can write like a sumbitch and to apply anyways.  Worse that can happen is not get interviewed.  Hopefully she will be in the next class.   Now, what I have to say about Joe tonight is that when I talked to him about an hour ago he said that he really missed me.  He wants to fly me out for a weekend but he doesn't have a car and he is afraid that he will get called into work the weekend I'm there.  I want to visit him b/c I miss him and, okay I'm going to be blunt here b/c that's me, I want to have sex.  I need some affection from him...STAT!  In all honesty I doubt that he will fly me out but if he does, the way my luck goes, he'd look at the weekend I'm going to MIA.  Then I will have to tell him and then he knows that I'm missing him and he will think that I'm going to visit Lewis b/c I'm horny.  Which is completely untrue as we all know but I am catching on to how Joe's mind works.  But I'm going to search for flights and see what I can come up with.

          I have a lot of stuff to write about in this entry so be prepared to stay a while.  Have a snack, grab a brew and settle in for what might be the funniest NO hotel experience ever.  To review, I went to NO with mom and her friend Lena Friday-Saturday-checked out on Sunday, and today was my first day at my new job @ Navy Fed.  First, allow me to begin on Friday.    Upon arriving at the Historic French Market Inn we had to wait 15mins to check in and then was given a room with only a king bed in it.  We then had to truck back to front desk and change rooms.  This was only the beginning of the chain of odd events.  Our new room was on the second floor and there was no elevator to get to that room in the hotel.  So we had 2 bags a piece plus a big cooler.  We, including the bellman, carried the luggage up the stairs and in out room.  The bellman told us that for being guests there we get 1 comp drink at a nearby bar/cafe per night.  The bar, we later discovered, was no where to be found.  So in our new room the temperature was like 80 degrees.  I turned the AC on high while Mom and Lena went to park the car.  By the time they returned I was all unpacked and settled in and the room did not change temperature.  Mom took of her shoes and when she walked by the AC unit the carpet was soggy and wet from the leaking AC.  Most of the carpet was like that.  SO we call the front desk and the Mgr sends up a maintenence guy who has to pound the AC door open.  He finds that there was a leak and the unit was frozen and needed to thaw.  So he puts down towels and says that by the time we get back from dinner that he will have it fixed.   Mom had already put our valuables in the room safe before the guy showed up and when he left she tried to open up the safe.  Well, it was unresponsive and had to call front desk again to have someone unlock it. So the MGr comes up with the key and unlocks it.  Then we get all our stuff together and go to leave and Mom can't get the room door to lock itself!  It was one of the French doors.  The kind that has 2 doors side by side.  So I got back up the stairs and I try to shut the door.  Nope!  Bear in mind that all of this is happening within our first hour of checking in!  Lena stays in the room, smoking(I'll get into that in a little bit), while mom and I trek back to the front desk.  We tell the same Mgr what's going on their excuse was that "Oh, the ghost is doing that.  Yeah, your room is in the haunted part of the hotel."  That is either the creepiest thing that has ever been said to me, or that is the best excuse that a hotel Mgr in NO can give a guest.  Well, Mom said that we either need to be moved to a better room or refund her a nights stay.  So the Mgr puts us in a bigger room overlooking Decatur St.  The bellman never shows up to help us carry our bags, after we repacked of course.    To make a long story short, there was a full moon all weekend while I was in NO.  In the new room, I heard someone put a key in the slot and not try to open the door Friday night.  I looked at the bottom of the door where the hallway light was showing, and I heard it again and there wasn't any feet shadows under the door!  Freaky.  Then when mom and Lena made it in from the casino, the safe chimed and opened itself.  I swear.  Right when they walked by the safe it unlocked and the door swung open by itself.    But the event that took the cake was on Saturday night when we crashed a wedding.  Oh yes, a freaking wedding. What happened was that all day long the hotel people were bleaching and washing the bricks in the entire courtyard.  It wasn't clear to me as to why they were being so detailed until we came off of our elevator and saw the unity candles, rose petals, and wedding guests.  Mom was pissed and walked right down the aisle, sidestepping the groom on the way out.  The groom just chuckled about it and somebody said "Can't you see we are having a wedding here?!"  I'd say there were about 30-50 people attending.  Lena and I were dressed to go out for another night on Bourbon, but we wait until the groom reaches the preacher and we scurry down the aisle to get out of the courtyard.  There was no other way to get out of our hotel room except to walk down the aisle.  I felt like a HUGE ASSHOLE doing that. I ignored the dirty looks from bridesmaids and parents.  Heading back to the room from dinner and drinks, Mom makes the Mgr walk us back to our room.  The reception was going on then and the couple was having thier first dance and when the photographer snapped a pic, there is me, mom and Lena in the background.  I'd pay to see the look on the brides' face when she gets that pic back!    Apparently, from what the Mgr told us that the couple signed the contract to have the wedding there that they were fully aware that it was a working hotel and guests will be coming and going as they please.  After he said that then I felt like a small asshole as opposed to the huge one.  But hey, at least I got to walk down the aisle this year!    Lena, now there is a person that I do not want to see again anytime soon.  She's in her late 20's and smokes like a fucking train.  Smokes cigarettes and weed.  As soon as she wakes up she lights a joint and she cannot function throughout the day without 2 or 3 more.  Unknowing to me, Mom reserved our room as a smoking room.  I can't apoligize for myself to not catering to smokers.  Fuck, they can ruin their lungs on their own time in their own space, away from mine.  All, and I mean all the smokers that I have known throughout my life have always been considerate of us nonsmokers and asked if it would bother anyone before lighting up.  Not Lena.   Because this is her world and everyone needs to adapt the way that she lives rather than compromise.  Now, don't get me wrong and call me a hipocrit b/c I used to smoke pot all the fucking time in college and as close as last summer.  Me and my girl friends got stoned everyday for 2 weeks straight once.  But that chapter has closed in my life and I have moved on.  Sure I may take another hit one of these days, but I can guarn-damn-tee you that there won't be a day where I  have  to do an ounce of weed in one weekend for me to function normally!! Lena is just a sad, pathetic case of addiction.  That, and the longer she went without smoking pot the more of a bitch she became.  Mom noticed her bad attitude on her way home as well.  I told Mom to put the pedal to the metal and get Lena's bad attitude back home!   The highlights of the weekend was The Bead Shop, getting a cartoon drawn portrait, and having my first Hand Gernade drink.  I gotta take Rebecca to The Bead Shop.  She would go apeshit in there, as I did.
