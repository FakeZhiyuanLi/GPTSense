       urlLink theosebes : "DIGGING ATHENS  The impending Olympics have sparked frenetic archaeological digs throughout host city Athens:  The 2004 Games have been a boon for archaeologists, bringing the biggest single antiquities treasure hunt in Athens and surrounding areas. Experts rushed in trying to beat the bulldozers at dozens of Olympic-related sites ? from sports venues to highways.  The finds so far range from prehistoric settlements to 2,500-year-old cemeteries to ruins from the Roman period, when Emperor Theodosius abolished the Olympics in A.D. 394. Christianity had taken root, and he deemed the games to be pagan.  "

       urlLink BEYOND NORTHERN IRAQ: STUHUGHESIRAQ@MAIL.COM : "The most amazing fireworks display I've ever seen has marked the end of the Opening Ceremony -- and the start of the Athens Games.  After spending all evening locked in the radio studio putting together a piece for Radio 4's World Tonight programme, we managed to file just in time to dash down the corridor and watch the pyrotechnics at first hand rather than on TV.  Most of the other broadcasters had the same idea. Dozens of people thundered down the corridor towards the glass front overlooking the Olympic Stadium.  However, one of the Arab TV channels was just about to go live -- and the sight of a herd of over-excited journalists heading in his direction sent him into a panic.  'We're going live, for God's sake,' he screamed.  But by the time he actually began his interview the fireworks had ended and the stadium had fallen silent.   Very bad timing.

       urlLink Athens Olympic Games Blog : "Opening Ceremony - Live Commentary  While it's just after 5:00am in my corner of the globe, myself, like billions of other people around the globe are getting comfortable in front of their televisions to watch the opening ceremony of the games of the XXVIII Olympiad.    The blown budget, the delayed construction and the many other factors that have left uncertainties as to whether the games would kick off without a hitch now seem to be in the distant past as the Olympic Stadium, in all its glory, fills with thousands of proud Athonians.  The traditional parade of nations during the Opening Ceremony will be done in the order of the Greek Alphabet which should make things a little less predictable for most.  Sydney was outstanding four years ago.  Bejing will get their turn in 2008.  But for now, it is Athens turn.  Let the games begin... "

       urlLink athensBLOG.ca : " With the opening ceremonies about to begin I am tempted to write down some predictions about these upcoming games.  Thus far there have been three major themes in the news about the games, none of which have to do with sport.  First there is the rumours that have been spread for the last two years that there is no way the Greeks would be ready.  The massive undertaking of construction projects including venues and support facilities and infrastructure seems to have been completed on time.  Second is that these games will be a battle between the athletes and the drug testers.  Hopefully the aggressive testing programs by individual countries have caught all the dopers and there will be very little revokation of medals during the games now that cough medicine and caffiene are legal again.  The third theme is that of security.  It seems that $2 billion of the $8 billion dollars spent on the games has been spent on security.  Hopefully no major incidents happen and people realize the world really is a safe place, and the peace message of the Olympic movement shines through.   "

Athens, on the verge of losing the Games four years ago because of chaotic preparations, raised the curtain on the greatest show on earth with an extraordinary flourish before a worldwide television audience of up to four billion people."

       urlLink Olympics Blog Athens 2004 Olympic Games Greece fan's eye blog diarynews We liked blue Eros. We liked the woman with the glowing pregnancy. We liked the DNA lasers. And Robin liked when the little boy arrived in a boat.   But this business of the athletes parading isn't exactly riveting TV. Soundtracked by what the Greek commentator called DJ Tiesto's 'modern disco music', the only real highlight has been the Bermuda team's natty red shorts. As we write Denmark are arriving. They look happy. Even though their outfits make them look like McDonald's staff.   Best get back to it. At least the use of the Greek alphabet to order the teams is providing a fun guess-who's-next game. Oh look, here come Switzerland..!

       urlLink Olympics in an Age of Global Broadcasting : "For forty years now, the Olympic Games have been televised to audiences around the globe, providing a public forum for assertions of national greatness and claims of superiority.  In this context, writes Olympics scholar Emma Wensing, international sport 'can be seen as a substitute for war, as physical prowess becomes a measure of a nation%u2019s standing on an international stage.'  Yet exactly how each country measures its standing varies.  National broadcasters, keen to profit from the combination of competition and nationalism, supplement international coverage with reports on specific 'home country' athletes and their achievements.  While larger countries' media can emphasize winning and 'going for the gold', smaller countries with less representation may choose to highlight the 'good sports' ethic of their athletes or other non-performance based criteria.  From New Zealand to Canada, Wensing says, important national characteristics are usually emphasized, and national symbols and rivalries are played up for the sake of home audiences.  'As the Olympics are staged over the next two weeks,' Wensing suggests, 'remember that what you are watching is not just athletes competing, but a carefully planned and managed television product designed to keep you interested by reinforcing where your allegiances should lie.'
