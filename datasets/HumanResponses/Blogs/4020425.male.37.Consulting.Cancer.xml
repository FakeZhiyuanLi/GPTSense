      Yes, I believe that the only really successful MMORPGs of the future are simulations with player created content (= created more or less by the players).  The other type would be the story driven MMORPGs&nbsp;that we so much of today. They work by throwing tons of content at the player; detailed graphics, compelling storylines and intricate quests. They are more like very interactive movies than games. They are also extremely demanding to create in terms of man hour to put into creating all the content. And they get consumed pretty fast by the player.  A simulation focuses on detailed game mechanics; the rules under wich the world operates. Not detail for sake of detail, but detail where it counts.&nbsp;Some designers start with the grand idea that player should be able to do anything in their world, which is just not realistic. The key is to find out where it counts to add more game mechanics.  By detailed game mechanics,&nbsp;I don't necessarily mean a game that is as  realistic  as possible. Nor do I mean advanced  physics,  such as&nbsp;in our latest 3D worlds. I mean a multitude of mechanics of many kinds that form complex relations that build up the world. Which means that the game has many dimensions and possibilities. It means that the game application is very openended and has many game&nbsp; concepts  implemented in it. This might be implemented as a realistic physics simulation. Or not. The goal is a world that feels intuitive and rich in possibilities. People have already experienced story-driven RPGs. I believe that once we create a well crafted MMORPG simulation we will change the way people play games a lot.

      Why have I created this blog? I like computer games. I used to work in the game industry programming games, but now I'm in the computer consultant business, designing and writing Windows and web applications. I don't play as much anymore as I used to, but I still like thinking about games. How they might be designed, how they could be improved.   The  urlLink MMORPG  genre of games is particularly interesting to me, since they are (or could become) so much more than just games. However, games of today lack imaginative originality, and I guess it is because of the game market and the enormous enterprise it is to create a successful game.   I hope that some of my ideas can change that. I will try to write down design ideas that could become a game some day. And if you have stopped by for some reason, feel free to comment my writings. I could as well have created a site with more like a design document for a game, but by using a Blog I feel more spontaneous, and if I'm lucky I'll get some valuable criticism.    urlLink Verve , the name of my Blog,&nbsp;means vitality, liveliness and the energy and enthusiasm of&nbsp;expressing ideas.
