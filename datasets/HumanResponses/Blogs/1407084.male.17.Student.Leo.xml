      I do not think I am going to go to the Homecoming dance..  I know there are a few girls who would like a date, and I feel bad because I am not planning on asking them, but I think I am too depressed to go to the dance. Oh well.  I am probably going to go to the party after the Homecoming dance.   Besides that, it seems that our band's field show is going to be the most horrid abomination I have ever taken part in. Yay for Jarvis, yay for not rehearsing things and forgetting them, yay for making us not porform the good looking part of the show and forcing us to play the uncoordinated mess that is "Birdland" on the field.  Maybe It wil rain Friday night. Everyone pray.

      A friend asked a gentleman how it is that he never married  Replied the gentleman, "Well, I guess I just never met the right woman ... I guess I've been looking for the perfect girl."  "Oh, come on now," said the friend, "Surely you have met at least on girl that you wanted to marry."  "Yes, there was one girl .. once. I guess she was the one perfect girl .. the only perfect girl I really ever met. She was just the right everything .. I really mean that she was the perfect girl for me."  "Well, why didn't you marry her," asked the friend.  "She was looking for the perfect man," he said.

      This song used to be one of my favorites.. (here is the space alloted for you to laugh at me) ok now you can read the lyrics   Savage Garden - "Crash and Burn"  When you feel all alone And the world has turned its back on you Give me a moment please to tame your wild wild heart I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you It's hard to find relief and people can be so cold When darkness is upon your door and you feel like you can't take anymore  Let me be the one you call If you jump I'll break your fall Lift you up and fly away with you into the night If you need to fall apart I can mend a broken heart If you need to crash then crash and burn You're not alone  When you feel all alone And a loyal friend is hard to find You're caught in a one way street With the monsters in your head When hopes and dreams are far away and You feel like you can't face the day  Let me be the one you call If you jump I'll break your fall Lift you up and fly away with you into the night If you need to fall apart I can mend a broken heart If you need to crash then crash and burn You're not alone  And there has always been heartache and pain And when it's over you'll breathe again You'll breath again  When you feel all alone And the world has turned its back on you Give me a moment please To tame your wild wild heart  Let me be the one you call If you jump I'll break your fall Lift you up and fly away with you into the night If you need to fall apart I can mend a broken heart If you need to crash then crash and burn You're not alone

      You people and your blogs.  All Talk... NO ACTION.  turst me, you know who you are, and writing in your blog that you can change is not going to help you change. All it is going to do is make your friends watch you fail to change. I've seen it in almost everyone who has written "I'm going to change" or something to that effect in their blog. If you truly were going to change, you wouldn't still be the ass that you are. Now stop kidding us.

      Oh wait, no.  Screw that.  I'm not done.  Skiing season is coming up.  Skiing is probably the one thing that can make me happy at this point.   Listening to Semi-Charmed Life doesn't even bring happiness to me anymore.  Oh well.  The first weekend I can go skiing I'm going, whether it be alone or with friends.  NOW IM DONE and you can stop reading my bullshit.  Good Night.

      This is my favorite song of all time. It's the best thing since sliced bread.  "Semi-Charmed Life" by Third Eye Blind   I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden and she lives for me, She says she lives for me, Ovation, She's got her own motivation,  she comes round and she goes down on me,  And I make her smile, It's like a drug for you,  Do ever what you want to do,  Coming over you, Keep on smiling,  what we go through.  One stop to the rhythm that divides you,  And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse,  Chop another line like a coda with a curse,  And I come on like a freak show takes the stage.  We give them the games we play, she said,  I want something else, to get me through this, Semi-charmed kind of life,  I want something else,  I'm not listening when you say, Good-bye.   The sky it was gold, it was rose,  I was taking sips of it through my nose,  And I wish I could get back there,  Some place back there,  Smiling in the pictures you would take,  Doing crystal myth,  Will lift you up until you break,  It won't stop,  I won't come down, I keep stock,  With a tick tock rhythm and a bump for the drop,  And then I bumped up. I took the hit I was given,  Then I bumped again,  And then I bumped again. How do I get back there to,  The place where I fell asleep inside you?  How do I get myself back to,  The place where you said,  I want something else to get me through this,  semi-charmed kind of life,  I want something else,  I'm not listening when you say, good-bye,   I believe in the sand beneath my toes,  The beach gives a feeling,  An earthy feeling,  I believe in the faith that grows,  And the four right chords can make me cry,  When I'm with you I feel like I could die.  And that would be all right,  All right, When the plane came in,  She said she was crashing,  The velvet it rips,  In the city we tripped,  On the urge to feel alive,  But now I'm struggling to survive,  The days you were wearing,  That velvet dress, You're the priestess,  must confess,  Those little red panties,  They pass the test,  Slide up around the belly,  Face down on the mattress,  One,  Now you hold me,  And we're broken.  Still it's all that I want to do.  Feel myself with a head made of the ground,  I'm scared but I'm not coming down.  And I won't run for my life,  She's got her jaws just locked now in smile  but nothing is all right,  All right, I want something else,  To get me through this,  Semi-charmed kind of life,  I want something else,  I'm not listening when you say,  good-bye.  Just reading the words for this song doesn't do it justice. You really should download the song and listen to it... you might see why I like it so much...

      I've been searching for meaningful songs to add to my blog.  Here's what I've come up with...   "The Middle" by Jimmy Eat World  hey, dont write your self off yet its only in your head you feel left out  or looked down on just try your best try everything you can and dont you worry what they tell themselves  when your away  it just takes some time little girl your in the middle of the ride everything(everything) will be just fine everything(everything) will be alright (alright)  hey, you know they're all the same. you know you're doing better on your own, so don't buy in.  live right now. yeah, just be yourself. it doesn't matter if its good enough, for someone else.  It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride everything (everything) will be just fine,  everything (everything) will be alright (alright)  (repeat)  (instrumental solo)  hey,dont write yourself off yet.  its only in your head you feel left out  or looked down on. just do your best, do everything you can. and don't you worry what the bitter hearts are gonna say.   It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride.  everything (everything) will be just fine, everything (everything) will be alright (alright)  (repeat) /end  Delve into it as you will, I will provide no further insight.. (it's pretty self-explanatory, geez)

      if you don't know what   leet   means, either, I suggest you go to www.urbandictionary.com and check out some of the words there. Don't click the ones that you know will offend you though, if you are easily offended. There aren't really censors on that site.

      Also, this word comes up a lot in conversations between avid(predominantly male) gamers:  noob "newb"   1. A person online who is new and/or unfamiliar with the environment.  1a. A "newbie".   2. A person who acts like they know everything (see also, n00b).  im super leet, noob.  There you have it.

      Ahh... I don't want to go to school tomorrow. I don't want to hang out with people who don't interest me anymore. I want to stay at home.. sleep until noon... wake up, take a 45 minute shower and go back to bed for the remainder of the afternoon. I want to wake up, again, and watch old reruns of old black and white television shows.. like leave it to beaver, and stuff. Anything but school. The Monster Mash is tomorrow night.. but I'm not going. I think I'll spend some quality time with my family, something that we haven't really been able to do for a while around my house. Maybe on Saturday I will go up to the cities.. spend all the money im saving for california. I don't really want to go to california anyways.   Ahh... i wish some people would grow up..   There's my blog. Do what you want with it.  And if you are female, don't waste your time over-analyzing it for hidden clues. You won't find them.

      Well, since my last idea was an utter failure... I'll just write blab some more.  I am pretty excited to go back to school. It's been a great weekend, I got to hang out with some old buddies that I don't hang out with that much these days. I realized today I have been hanging out with the same old group of friends too much, and my relations with them have been taking a turn for the worse. I am now on a quest to find some new friends so I can give myself a break from the regular group of friends when I need it.   Now I'm sorry If you feel like I complain a lot.. but.. hey! Why should I care what you think? This is my creative outlet, is it not? Complain mode activated.  List of things I don't like: 1) People who don't respect me 2) People who mock my religion 3) Not swinging during parades in band 4) Homework 5) Movies that end halfway. Damn the movie industry.

      So today..  Eden Prarie. Today started out with me not caring at all for the field show. But by the time we had to perform, as usual at  band functions, we were all pumped and ready for some field showage.  We performed our field show, and it was great. We waited patiently through all the other bands to find out how we did, and boy was it worth the wait. WE BEAT SOMEONE! I really couldn't believe this when they announce that we had a second place trophy. It was nice.  Anyways... other than that.. I had some good fun times with a couple old friends that I haven't done anything with for a while. It made me feel good.. they think I am funny, for some reason. I suggest you all go leave your little cliques behind for a day and go spend some time with friends you wouldn't normally hang out with. It's worth it, believe me.  Lately, everybody seems to be clinging on to all their friends like they are all going to dissapear tomorrow. I don't see why it is so hard to reach new people for some of these friends. Should I call them friends? One person that I know is very friendly, but won't ever invite me to any youthly gatherings that they host because they don't know me well enough. I have invited them to mine, and they come, and I get no compensation. I don't mean to sound greedy, but this seems to be happenening a lot with more people than just that one friend. I just wish that the people I know that invite all my friends to do stuff with them, whether it be parties, movies, bowling, or even freakin' going to pick up some burgers at mcdonalds just invite me to also participate. I could have parties all the time, but at this point it feels to me that if nobody else ever invites me, why should I invite them, or ever have them at all?   OK new topic. Skiing. 1..2..3 go I want to ski. It's been like a year since we've been able to hit the slopes. Every time I walk into my room, I get depressed because I see my skis just lying there all lonesome and unused. Sigh...  Well, I'm tired of writing this, so I am going to go play counter-strike, which is what I do when I'm not invited to things. Bye.

      Well, Here I am.. doing nothing. I should be getting ready for eden prarie, but i really just don't care in the least about eden prarie. I know I should, being the section leader and all, but I tire of band. Jarvis is such a blockhead.. there's no real explanation that can describe how he is. He wants our band to be like the marching bands from Pipestone, and all those incredible shows.. those people dedicate their whole life to band it seems. Jarvis wants us to be able to compete with them someday, but he just doesnt' realize the John Marshall Band doesn't have the potential to do that.. not without having all members not participate in any fall activities other than marching band, anyways. Not gonn happen. Our field show sucks. Die. Let's have another Trombone Barbeque... this time.. let's bring a spatula.

      Sometimes I wonder why I write the things I do in this blog. Maybe it is because I am bored, but maybe subconsiously I believe this crap that I write is true. Looking back, a whole lot of it is just a that--a bunch of crap fabricated to aid me in my search for acceptance and happiness.   Sometimes I wonder, as well, how some people can be so social to other people and not me. There are a few certain people who do a lot of stuff that I do too, but none of them have ever taken the time to get to know me. You know who you are. Yes, you. mhm.

      additions to story time. yay.  well, he tells me that one time in his freshman year in high school he sent her a flower from one of the school sponsored "send your sweetheart a flower" type of setups(could not resist. sorry.) but he was still such a wuss that he could not tell her that he liked her. what a punk. he also tells me, completely unrelatedly(is that a word?) that he hates peanut butter.

      Small get-togethers are the best way to interact and learn more about people. I especially enjoy when there are different people from different cliques, it engages you more with people outside your group, and again, helps you learn what other people do in their free time.   I need to wax my skis.. And get new windshield wipers.. that reminds me.. I gotta work tomorrow. Darn.   Story Time!   There once was this guy who liked this girl. For 3 years, he contemplated telling her how he felt, but since it had been so long since he had talked to her, or even said hi, he felt like there would never be a chance. This guy wished he could tell this girl how he felt, even if she did not feel the same way. To this day he wonders what could have been if he had had more balls. The end. Maybe someday there will be more to this story, but don't count on it. This guy is, in my opinion, too wussy to ever finish this story. This guy will always dream, though...

This week, starting Tuesday, I got 85 extra credit in world affairs for not wearing any sweat shop made clothes (at least ones made by nike, gap, guess, old navy, levis, and some others).. such an easy task for a whole letter grade(almost) of extra credit.. wow.. life is good.  anyways..

      Kate.  Kate has been a great inspiration for me. When I feel down, she always has some awesome advice to help bring me back up. When I need a friend to talk to because I feel like I've lost touch with reality, I can always go to her. She tells it like it is. Nothing more, nothing less. You all should talk to her.. her IM is "kateisi" without the quotes. She also is excellent at writing poems. You should all read this poem she wrote:  once there was a girl who took a walk at night she wandered along the roadside alone and out of site  as she walked along that road a car came speeding near the headlights bounced from side to side and her heart filled up with fear  before she thought another thing she was laying on the ground she saw that blood was streaming out and she screamed without a sound  as she looked one last time a face stared in her eye "we're going to help you" he said but she just said goodbye  then the darkness came again followed by a light a driver full of alcohol  stole her life that night  now its time that walks along the road and the driver is in jail but it doesn't put away the pain of such tremendous scale     another young life was lost that night and a family's torn apart memories are all that's left an end came from a start.  Good, eh!!? Better than anything I've written.  Tomorrow I shall bring you another profile of a good soul. ta ta for now

I am starting to think all my friends who used to care don't care anymore. Don't be that way, please! You don't even have to solve anyone's problems or anything..  all you have to do is listen to what people have to say . It seems that some of us are too wrapped up in your own lives to take note that others are falling apart around us as well. I know I am... how about you?

      The play is over.... I'd like to say I'm sad about this, I really would.. but, as I have seen at least 1 other person that feels the same way I do, I cannot. The entity of performing the play.. that was fun. But pretty much everything else about it, minus a really cool cast party at Cassedy's, was hell for me. I really don't think I ever want to be in theatre again.  Brandon said this at the "Magic Circle" before the third performance: "The theatre people were the most inviting, welcoming people in this community."(something really close to that, anyways). I have had the exact opposite experience. I wish you people were as inviting and welcoming as he says you are, because I could really use some inviting and welcoming, dammit.  I used to also have a huge respect for most of the junior guys in theatre, but a lot of them just turned out to be very different people than what Brandon was talking about. Only a very small percentage actually seem to care about and listen to their peers.. what kind of team operates like that? If you didn't say anything, you are correct. Without respect, what kind of team are we? We're just a bunch of boys and girls putting on a play. Not a cast..... no.. not yet.

      Opening night for the play was tonight (Thursday, not Friday yet).   WE KICKED SOME ASS.   Very few errors and a few unexpected comedic events made tonight's opener teh shiznit. fo sheezy. (pardon the gibberesh. there are no english words good enough to describe tonight).   After that, we went to Perkins. It was ok, too many loud freshman though. All the upperclassmen kept telling them to shut up, and they would listen to us and shut up for about 5 seconds, then start again. Damn freshman. Well, seeing as how it is now 12:19, I shall go.   Actually, no. Scrap that. I shall leave you with... A SONG!! Look in the next entry for it.  (edit: I forgot to put up a song.. I must have fallen asleep or something.. sorry.. i put a snippet of one up there to make up for it)

      Well, today I feel really good. No negative, unhappy thoughts, comments whatever will be included in this blog.  I feel good not because something good happened to me, but because I helped something good happen to someone else. If you know what I am talking about, then you know how good the feeling is. I won't get into any detail on how i helped this person, because it would be untrustworthy of me to tell you all, and frankly, it doesn't really matter what happened. It is that it is fixed that is important now.  This is the first time in a long time I have felt really good about myself. I think the only way to keep myself happy like like I am now is to help  myself  now. Most of my blogs have been rather negative lately. Why that is, again, is not as important as to how I can invert my attitude. I am going to make a huge attempt, no, I'm  going  to turn myself around.   I remember back in the day, back in an undefined time a few years ago, it was so easy to have fun with my friends. We could have fun mainly because none of us cared what anybody else thought about us. We could have fun poking people with sporks at the lunch table, for crying out loud. These days,I am having trouble concentrating, finding something to say in a conversation, making common bonds between me and my friends. I have a hard time laughing at jokes that I should roll on the floor laughing for. I need to get back to the point where I was back in those good old days.. more secure, more sure of myself. I am going to start living life in a much happier manner, starting by making back some of the friends I have lost (or who have lost me) in the past few months.    Happiness, they say, is not a place but a destination. I am sure going to start heading that way, and with a little help from all of you, maybe that can happen. A journey like this one is not unique to me, it can be done and it has been done many times before. But never before has anyone completed this arduous task without the support of their friends. It gets easier and easier with every friend that you have there to help you. So please, please, please, help me out.

      Well, CJ's halloween party was last night.   I must say, sitting on the floor being yelled at because my head was in the way was no fun. (We were watching a movie, and to top it all off I have already seen it.. grrr)  I left early, but I think only 1 person noticed that I was leaving, so oh well. I say "Bah" to all those people who don't care, and I thank the one person there who seemed to care that I was leaving, they know who they are, and you are probably not them.  I really want to go for a long drive through the country.. just watch the plains roll past my windows, not a care in the world. But, that's probably not going to happen. So I'll just imagine I'm driving though the countryside and that my car has cruise control for a few minutes.

      Hrmm Here I am writing a post in my blog stalling for time so I can try and decide what it is I want to say in this issue not quite sure yet...  How about.. a song!   excerpts from "The Voice Within" by Christina Aguilera   Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed  It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid  No one reaches out a hand for you to hold  When you're lost outside look inside to your soul   When there's no one else  Look inside yourself  Like your oldest friend  Just trust the voice within  Then you'll find the strength  That will guide your way  If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within   Yeah...  Life is a journey  It can take you anywhere you choose to go  As long as you're learning  You'll find all you'll ever need to know   You'll make it  You'll make it  Just don't go forsaking yourself  No one can stop you  You know that I'm talking to you   When there's no one else  Look inside yourself  Like your oldest friend  Just trust the voice within  Then you'll find the strength  That will guide your way  If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within

      I haven't really updated in a while.. not much to say, I guess. So today I got to drive to school in a snowstorm. Don't get me started on that. On the way to church I heard this really great song that I felt begins to describe how I feel. If you feel offended, don't be, it's probably not directed towards you. The people that it is directed towards probably won't take the hint anyways.. the song is by Clay Aiken, and it's called "Invisible". The part that sticks out the most from that song goes as follows:  "I wish I was invisible Wait, I already am..."  Sometimes I feel as if I rely too much on my friends too much, and the ones I count on the most usually seem to let me down. Maybe it is all in my head.. I could try to explain this more in depth, but, again, I don't want to offend anyone.  Sorry If I already have.. I don't mean to.   Well, I've been catching up on the music I haven't been listening to in the past while.. another song that partially describes my mood is by Stacie Orrico. The title is "(There's Gotta Be) More to Life" Call me a pop music junkie and you would be correct.. hehe  "I've got it all but I feel so deprived I go up, I come down, and I'm emptier inside Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing And Why can't I let it go??  There's gotta be more to life...  Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me  Cause the more that I'm...  Tripping out thinking there must be more to life  Well it's life, but I'm sure... there's gotta be more  Than wanting more"  You may have noticed I have not been on AOL instant messenger for a while, and when I do, it is in very small amounts. This is because when I AM on only 2 people talk to me. It bothers me when I try to greet people online only to get a "Hey" response and then silence for the next 10, 15 minutes, until they say something really unimportant and stupid. Therefore, I have decided that is is a much more efficient use of my time to go do something else rather than sit here and wait for people to respond. Nobody probably noticed anyways..  On a side note, my trombone jury is tomorrow. I will show Brian up again, as usual, even though he probably deserves first chair a little more than I do. Oh well. That's the way the cookie crumbles.  At first, I was excited to be in Ski Club this year, but now there is no ski club, and finally there is snow.. I think the passion has died out.. somebody help me with this one. I dunno why I feel this way.   My mom is at home for six weeks because she broke her arm the night before Thanksgiving. That is the reason I was in Rochester all of Thanksgiving Break.. time mainly spent in the hospital with my mom.. she had to have surgery on her arm. They put in some metal screws and plates and stuff. I'm sure it'll be fun when she tries to board an airplane... Sigh... I told Alexi I was going to watch Donnie Darko tonight.. but I did not have time.. too much time spent practicing my trombone.. I'll watch it tomorrow and return it to him on Friday I guess. I got paid today.. but I fear it was a moot point because my parents are now making me buy new tires for my car. Damn.  Wow.. I wrote that top portion about five minutes ago. I guess I fell asleep in my chair again.. I'm off to bed. I wonder if anyone reads my blog. If you do, tell me, I am interested to see who reads this thing. I remember when I had a hit counter that I was pretty much the only one making the numbers go up.  I talk too much. Bye.

      Way to rain on my parade.. Good thing I was in a good mood, or this would really have been a disaster  Should the drunken coward that decided to throw that beer bottle through my rear windshield late last night ever come forth, I'd like to have a few words with him. Now I have to drive around with this really gay looking piece of plastic duct taped onto my rear windshield until I can get it fixed. Excuse my angry sound.. to tell you the truth, I am not really that angry about it, I just wish the person would step forth and get me a new windshield  Also, if your name is CJ or Allison, I can't take you to school for a while until I get this fixed..  To end on a happy note, I get to spend time with some friends tonight. Hopefully we will have as much fun as I think we are going to have.

      I love my speech class.. I've only been to it a few days, but I know that it will be one of the coolest classes I will take in my high school career. I have the best teacher, too: Ms. Nieland! It's so easy to get up in front of the class. For some reason or another I am very comfortable in speaking to all these people I do not know very well, but I really like it a lot, and I hope to meet some new, interesting people in that class.

      I sometimes wonder to myself why I have ended up at the position I am in. Lonely, yet in the company of some of the best female companions I have ever had.. it is often a good feeling and a sigh of relief to know that there are some people I can turn to, and I have turned to them.. but other times I feel incomplete. What to do... what to do.  Maybe I need to search a little bit harder for what I am looking for.. I probably need to take the advice I just gave to a good friend..  "Take chances, make mistakes, it is the only way things can happen"  I'm going to take some chances... hopefully they will be the right ones, but there is only one way to find out, eh?

      I think this song is pretty true to life.. even if it is sung by a no talent American Idol assclown.  Love can be a many splendored thing Can't deny the joy it brings A dozen roses  Diamond rings Dreams for sale And fairy tales It’ll make you hear a symphony And you just want the world to see But like a drug that makes you blind It’ll fool you every time  The trouble with love is It can tear you up inside Make your heart believe a lie It's stronger then your pride The trouble with love is It doesn’t care how fast you fall And you can’t refuse the call See you’ve got no say at all

       Maddox says it best   The grass is always greener on the other side:  If the grass is greener on the other side, then the guy with the greener grass doesn't think your grass is greener now does he, asshole? The message that this proverb is trying to stumble through is that everything always looks more attractive when you don't have it. I'm sure there are millionaires crying themselves to sleep every night because they don't live in a trailer park. Just face it: sometimes nobody envies you. There has to be a bottom and that bottom is probably you.   Some of the best things in life are free:  Yeah? Well so are some of the worst, and I don't see anyone throwing a party when they get cancer.     maddox.xmission.com

      A friend, by definition, is:  friend    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (frnd) n.  1) A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.  2) A person whom one knows; an acquaintance.  3) A person with whom one is allied in a struggle or cause; a comrade.  4) One who supports, sympathizes with, or patronizes a group, cause, or movement: friends of the clean air movement.  5) Friend A member of the Society of Friends; a Quaker.    I stole that right outta the dictionary, by the way. You see, what I think is going on around here is a lot of numbers 1 and 2, but no 3. When I think of a friend, I think of someone I could tell anything to, someone that will listen and understand what is going through my head. Very few people I know fit this description. However, for whatever reason it is, I don't tell those few people. If I have something on my mind, whether it be a problem or a good idea or whatever, the people I usually tell first would shrug it off and change the subject. Therefore, for the longest time, there was really nowhere for me to go, nobody for me to talk to. Today though, a friend told me exactly what I wanted/needed to hear.. that there are, in fact, people who genuinely care and enjoy my presence.   I seriously do not want to give you guys the impression that you aren't my friends, though. Don't get that idea stuck in your head, I really think all of you guys are great people. But being friends isn't just about going to parties with each other or watching movies with each other. It goes way deeper than that.   I leave you with a quote:  "To have a friend, be a friend."

      If there was one ultimate thing that bugged me, it would be people who mock other's religions. Why in the world would you be bring yourself to such low of a point as to mock someones religion? Cmon, seriously, If you don't agree with someone's religion, that's great, and none of us are going to  make you change your mind. But once you take it past that certain point, the point where you begin to mock the religion, you have gone too far. I do not know about others, but I take it very personally, and I'd even go as far as to say that The Lord himself takes it was more personally than I.

      Why couldn't I have Mr. Trolander??  Here I am stuck doing this gay 250 point final project that will take all of my study time from every other class away. So stupid. Maybe I'll just not do it.

      A friend asked a gentleman how it is that he never married  Replied the gentleman, "Well, I guess I just never met the right woman ... I guess I've been looking for the perfect girl."  "Oh, come on now," said the friend, "Surely you have met at least on girl that you wanted to marry."  "Yes, there was one girl .. once. I guess she was the one perfect girl .. the only perfect girl I really ever met. She was just the right everything .. I really mean that she was the perfect girl for me."  "Well, why didn't you marry her," asked the friend.  "She was looking for the perfect man," he said.  --I know I put this in my blog before, but I like it a lot, so I'm putting it in again.   I was talking with someone I am acquainted with, but am not quite friends with yet, and she says I am too shy. I am sort of shy, but usually when I meet new people I usually end up listening to others converse with them about things that happened at an event I was not present at, or something that I have no knowledge of. Thus, it is hard to establish common bonds with the people that I meet because others are always busy expressing their common bonds with them and I don't get much of a chance, partly because I am shy. Make any sense at all?  Well then: First order of business (I wish I could put sounds on this blog, I want like the judges hammer from law and order on here when i say that): What is going on this weekend, what are the plans, and who are the planners?  Second order: Hmm.. well I will think of a second order and put it on here right away, dammit.  Third order of business: Math final tomorrow--oh shit.. im outta here  This is the story of a girl/Who cried a river and drowned the whole world!/And while she looked so sad in photographs  I absolutely love her/when she smiles

      Ever wonder what you want to do with your life? I haven't. I have had the luxury of knowing what I am going to do since I was a little kid. I know I will become some sort of computer dude. Right now I am leaning towards a Network Engineer.. but hey, things may change. I want to go to college at a Wisconsin State College.. preferably one that is not close to Rochester.  Maybe I'll find a girl that likes me in Wisconsin too..   I should probably stop while I'm ahead

      I can't wait to go to California.. I get to see palm trees! Ha, yeah, bet you are thinking "that's a lame reason to want to go to California".. but I love palm trees. They make me feel good for some reason. The trip will be interesting.. I am rooming with Josh Priniski, Justin Dzeja, and probably CJ, but I think he really wants to room with Brian and Christian. Ah, well, it'll probably be CJ anyways. Well, we developed a tradition last year where we would bring a RISK game with us to the hotel and play RISK every night.  It seems that the tradition spilled over into a regular weekend event held at my house once a month or so.                   Good times.. good times.

      I went to handbell choir the other night, it was fun. Sarah wanted me to go really bad, so I went, and she was sick. Figures.  However, you would be surprised at how nice the people are. They brought cookies. Yum..   I really want to go to bed right now. But, for some reason, I have been coersed to stay up and write. Hmm. I'd have a hard time sleeping anyways.  I took a walk around the world  To ease my troubled mind I left my body laying somewhere In the sands of time I watched the world float  To the dark side of the moon I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah I watched the world float  To the dark side of the moon After all I knew it had to be  Something to do with you I really don’t mind what happens now and then As long as you’ll be my friend at the end  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  I love country music. There is a song for everything. :)  BTW, the above song is "Kryptonite" by 3 Doors Down. It is not country. Have you ever just listened to the lyrics of a George Strait Album? So many songs of his carry truths of life. I guess I am a secret fanatic of George Strait music.   Maybe I'm missing my calling.. maybe I should become a radio DJ when I am older.. haha  Suppose something you remember as being extraordinary and wonderful goes away for a while and appears back as something totally different from what you remember, yet exactly the same.. Maybe you know the feeling.. it's strange. I am talking gibberish, so I am going to hit the sack(I wonder where that originated..) See you all tomorrow.. err.. wow, almost today, I had better get going

Good song, if you are interested in any sort of pop music i suggest you ILLEGALY PIRATE IT FROM YOUR FAVORITE MP3 DOWNLOAD SOURCE sorry i don't like the RIAA

      These friars were behind on their belfry payments, so they  opened up a small florist shop to raise funds. Since everyone  liked to buy flowers from the men of God, a rival florist across  town thought the competition was unfair. He asked the good fathers  to close down, but they would not. He went back and begged the  friars to close. They ignored him. So, the rival florist hired Hugh MacTaggart, the roughest and most vicious thug in town to "persuade"  them to close. Hugh beat up the friars and trashed their store,  saying he'd be back if they didn't close up shop. Terrified,  they did so, thereby proving that Hugh, and only Hugh, can  prevent florist friars.

      Well, Snodaze is coming up.. maybe some girl will ask me to go with them  hahaha, that was good for a short laugh..   I think I am going to do some creative writing.. I need more original writing in here  There once was an Arabic King named Munkaicy Maiunkeidew. He had a very loyal servant named Alhizeer Ipstoyulompistromelya. Alhizeer loved the King, and someday wanted to be released from his term as servitude for the King so he could be friends with the King and go to his marvelous parties and enjoy the wonderful company of his vivacious friends and, of course, the King's 24 karat gold plated toilet. Only the King and close personal friends could relieve themselves in this strange, but extraordinarilly comfortable toilet. Alhizeer worked extra hard to try and earn his freedom, but it was not enough for him to become a free man. He had to think of more that he could do. At last, after many a night of comtemplation and meditation, he had an idea. "I could build him a shrubbery! Then King Munkaicy will relieve me of my duties as servant and make me a friend of his! I had better get started!" The servant worked and worked, each day harder than the day before. He had paid for the majestic shrubbery with the small amount of money he had been saving ever since the beginning of his tenure as a servant for the King. At last, the moment came: Alhizeer presented the shrubbery to King Munkaicy in all its splendor and glory. King Munkaicy looked at Alhizzer and said, "Alhizeer, this is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me. I know you have been wanting to escape from the chains and shackles of servanthood, so I shall release you." Alhizeer was so excited by this statement by the King that he broke out into tears. "I thank you from the bottom of my heart, o lord. Maybe now I could become a member of your circle of friends?" The King thought for a while, and replied, "Why, yes, Alhizeer, you may certainly be a member of my circle of friends! Why don't you come visit my palace festivities tomorrow?" Alhizeer was overjoyed at this opportunity, so he immediately went home and went to sleep. The next day Alhizeer woke up, got dressed, the usual. Come nightfall, he walked to the palace. He waltzed into the corridor of the ballroom, expecting people to greet him and offer to serve him drinks, but he saw none of the sort. He saw the King at a small table near the back of the room, and ventured a trip to go sit with him. Alhizeer felt like royalty when he was offered a seat at the table by a well-dressed servant. Alhizeer began to propose that there should be a toast to the King for all he had done for the country, but was rudely interrupted by a man wearing a nicer turban than himself. Alhizeer stopped talking and listened to the man. " He might have something important to say ", he conjectured to himself. The man began to speak: "Today, gentleman, marks the third anniversary of the day I first polished this table!" Alhizeer thought to himself,  "What a stupid thing to say! Why is he telling us that?"  Alhizeer decided his toast should take place right about then. "Excuse me, gentlemen, but I would like to pro--"  "Ahoy Mateys, have you ever had so much to drink that you think you can fly?",shouted a portly gentleman to the left of the King. Alhizeer grew angered. He kept getting interrupted at the table. Alhizeer decided that he would just be quiet and listen for a while. However, party after party, Alhizeer kept getting interrupted and stayed quiet.  "Maybe someday I will get a chance to talk" , he wondered to himself. The years passed, and Alhizeer kept waiting for his chance to talk. One day, the King invited him out for lunch. Alhizeer was quiet for most of the meal. "Why are you so quiet?", the King inquired. "I do not have anything to say. Everything foolish that I could possibly say has been said already, and everything that I can say that would be wise is not heard! I have run out of things to say because after the moment passes they mean nothing to anyone. What should I do, O King?"  Which character fits you the best? are you..  The King? The interrupter? Alhizeer? Or are you the retard who asked if anyone has had so much to drink that they thought they could fly? Think about it..

      Quite odd, you see, I thought I would never have to post this song. However, I think now would be a good time to do so.   Jumper  by  Third Eye Blind   I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend,  You could cut ties with all the lies That you've been living in,  And if you do not want to see me again,  I would understand,  I would understand,  The angry boy A bit too insane,  Icing over a secret pain,  You know you don't belong,  You're the first to fight,  You're way too loud,  You're the flash of light,  On a burial shroud,  I know something's wrong,  Well everyone I know has got a reason,  To say Put the past away,  I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend,  You could cut ties with all the lies,  That you've been living in,  And if you do not want to see me again,  I would understand,  I would understand,  Well he's on the table,  And he's gone to code,  And I do not think anyone knows,  What they are doing here,  And your friends have left,  You've been dismissed,  I never thought it would come to this,  And I, I want you to know,  Everyone's got to face down the demons,  Maybe today,  We can put the past away,  I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend,  You could cut ties with all the lies That you've been living in,  And if you do not want to see me again,  I would understand,  I would understand,  I would understand...  Can you put the past away,  I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend,  I would understand...    Yep. I'm gonna go watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail now. Have a good rest of the night, and, oh, before I forget..   Remember to drink your milk--it keeps your bones nice and strong.

      I am going to copy and paste this blatantly from another person's weblog-thingamajig. Here it is:  Love has the unfortunate tendency to tear to shreds the comfort and stability that we manage to fashion for ourselves. So, why do we always keep hoping for it if it just ends up scarring us for the rest of our lives? Some say that it's so we can learn, and be better people. Learn for what, the next time love mauls us? No thanks. And not everyone becomes a better person afterwards. Some become psychotics, or recluses, or narcissists, even. Trust me. I know. And yet, some others don't learn or become better people. They just keep on living life and getting hurt by those they love. So, I guess the point of this entry is to try to convince you of something, but I'm not exactly sure what. Um...oops...   I like this. It speaks the truth.  However, There are other views that can be taken on this heartwrenching subject. This person did not list the other outcome of love. If love works out for you, it can be the best thing that can ever happen to you. It can make you become a better person, a happier one. This person's view on their side of love is very accurate and well supported, in my opinion. But the the other type of love, if you are lucky, will happen first..   oh who am i kidding i know nothing about love have a good rest of the night people and props to alexi, nice article

      damn i just realized i had the wrong title on my blog for a while it read: "If music is the food of life, play on" but should have read: "If music is the food of love, play on" that is a quote from the opening  passage of Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" in case you were wondering, because, well, if I wasn't reading it, I would be wondering myself. Now you know.

      I went a to a party at an old friend who is off to college's house last night. I must say, Erika throws the  best  parties I have ever been to, no doubt.   While there, I noticed some normal behavior of two juniors I know, but am not great friends with. (believe me, though, i would like to be better friends with them)  -Enter Party -Stand in stairway -(halfhour passes, still there) -(another half hour passes, still in same spot) -(ten minute game of pool takes place) -Back to stairway to stand -Exit Party  Now seriously, if you go to a party, it is almost expected of you to make some sort of attempt to talk to more than one person. It is really boring to watch people stand under the stairway and not join in regular conversations with everyone else.   It still was the best party I have been to in a long while. Better than a movie party. Movie parties at people's houses have kinda.. lost their appeal, at least to me.  So now I'm thinking about movies. ~~Idea!~~ Anyone want to go see a movie on Friday? I want to go see  The Last Samurai  with Tom Cruise, it looks pretty good. Drop me a line, or something, or better yet I'll just make it a public invitation.. talk to me at school, and I'll get it organized. and um.. ill buy my own popcorn this time :)

      I find it amazing that some people can be so cold.  For some reason, something that happened a long time ago came to mind.. I was batting in the batting cages(this was back when I used to play baseball) with my coach pitching. I kept swinging at the oncoming balls but I had a very low hit ratio.. it was like 1 in 5 or 1 in 6 balls that i would hit, and usually the ones I hit didn't go very far. Well there was this one kid outside the cage who kept ridiculing me because I couldn't hit the ball. The coach started yelling at him and he said "When you hit every ball pitched to you, you can begin to criticize his batting". I don't know why, but that stuck in my mind.

      That was rather rude, man. I pick up the phone, knowing you would be on the other end thanks to the joys of caller id. I start talking, wondering if you finally want to give in and hang out again, only to find out that you just want to know where someone else is. It's one thing to not ever do things with me, but calling my house to find out if the person you really want to hang out with is here is another thing. Grrr. I would give anything for a true friend.

      ohhhh... I am about to pee my pants, I am so excited. yesterday the cable guy arrived with two brand spanking new digital video recording boxes and promptly changed the rest of my life..  I can now go to the bathroom without missing part of that computer show on G4TechTV (whatever it is now). I can pause television on a whim, and(if i choose) come back hours, days, weeks, or even months later and finish my show. Damn.. I was so excited, I spent an hour just looking at all the movies on television during the next week and picking and choosing which ones i wanted to digitally record.. and seeing that there are about 18 movie channels that we get now, there is no shortage. Damn... Who needs friends when you can watch movies for the rest of your life?

      Yeah. I have to give a speech next hour, but I haven't gotten it fully prepared. I think I'll just not do it. I'll probably write it tonight.. we are going to Valley Fair on friday, and it should be hella fun. Jake is coming down on Saturday night, we will party like none other(ha, just imagine me partying like none other). I set up this computer that I recieved for free from my church as a web server, but it is too slow, really, to actually host a web site. Oh well. It's a P133 with 96 megabytes of RAM and an ATI Rage 128 Graphics Card. It runs Half-Life, and it is actually playable, which is pretty funny.

      I tend to overexaggerate a lot on here. Gives me something to do. Hehe.  In other news, The currency of Everquest, the platinum, has gone up in value. It now has a bulk exchange rate of over 1 penny. If only I had a million platinum.. I would probably end up giving it away.  I have this horrible urge to go to college. It looks so fun.. I am desperate to get out of this stupid town. There is nothing here for me. I think after college, the only reason I would ever come back is to visit my family and to stay here during the summers between school years, and maybe to occasionally toilet paper a former teacher or two's place of residence . Ahh.. college.. the word has this ring to it that makes it just resonate inside my head over and over.. somebody please pinch me. Anyone?

      I got my SAT scores tonight.. I bet if I wasn't such a slacker(meaning schoolwise) I could get into whatever school I want. I got a 27 on my ACT, and a 1250 on my SAT(680 math, 570 verbal). I saw Augsburg today, it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be. Morris had a way more organized tour and a better computer science program. I guess I'll find out come fall, when I apply to all these schools. Hmm.

      So tired.. really, I am..  Wyoming meeting at 7:00, kevin, brian, this means you.  Off to Augsburg tomorrow to visit the campus, should be loads of fun (sarcastic upwards stare). Maybe we will eat at some really cool restuarant, just maybe..  I purchased Grease last night.. that movie, as well as the play(I hope we do it next year) kicks major ass. I'm glad Henry Winkler wasn't cast as Danny Zuco.. that would have been just.. just.. I can't even think about it, it would have been so bad. He looks the part, but he's got nothin', and i mean NOTHING, on John Travolta.

      I don't want you to give it all up And leave your own life collecting dust And I don't want you to feel sorry for me You never gave us a chance to be And I don't need you to be by my side To tell me that everything's alright I just wanted you to tell me the truth You know I'd do that for you Why are you running away? Why are you running away? Cause I did enough to show you that I Was willing to give and sacrifice And I was the one who was lifting you up When you thought your life had had enough And when I get close, you turn away There's nothing that I can do or say So now I need you to tell me the truth You know I'd do that for you So why are you running away? Why are you running away? Is it me, is it you Nothing that I can do To make you change your mind Is it me, is it you Nothing that I can do Is it a waste of time? Is it me, is it you Nothing that I can do To make you change your mind So why are you running away? Why are you running away? ...What is it I've got to say... So why are you running away? ...To make you admit you're afraid... Why are you running away?     Another day is going by I'm thinking about you all the time But you're out there, and I'm here waiting

      This is strange... usually I am offended by certain people's complaining and moaning, but now that I've pretty much removed all ties and stopped being friends with them, it seems so humorous and pathetic that someone would take the time to write such a long entry on why everything that they do is the best way to do it and everyone else's way is wrong. I even chuckled a little bit thinking about how narrow minded it was. I could really care less about it, just kind of interesting.   I guess I have nothing to complain about.. I lost my two best friends.. but after losing them, I realized how constricting they were towards my lifestyle. I'm starting to think I might be better off without them. Hey, if they have better things to do than to pick up the phone and invite me to parties, that's fine with me, I can have my own party.. I'll invite all of you!  Anyways, I'm going to Augsburg on Thursday to check out the campus. Sounds like it should be fun. Aced the math test today. Juries in band are next week, and I should probably practice.   Nah.

      roses fade and rot with time but memories never die a complicated mess of thoughts refreshes the will to try off and on and off throughout the path is quite direct but obstacles and roadblocks remove you from the track it's understood love can't be forced but my heart I give to you and maybe sometime, now or later you will come through too

Leigh you should give me your schedule so I can plan a saturday off. gimme a call, or something.   by the way, for all you people reading this blog, I want you to know that i hate each and every one of you equally. thank you. bye now.  Well, good luck building trebuchets, lifeguarding, dreaming, twirling your hair, guitaring, movie recording, eating, exercising, dancing, movieing, girl scouting, horseback riding, flirting with people, ice creaming, or whatever you happen to be doing. I'll be thinking of you while I watch tv for the remainder of my summer.

      Sometimes people  don't  do things because they fear that people will find out they  want  to do them..    At least that's what I learned from the movie  The Village . Decent movie, but it just doesn't seem as good as some of M. Night Shyamalan's other movies(The Sixth Sense and Signs to name a couple).  I saw the Twins play the Red Sox tonight at the Metrodome. it was pretty crazy up there! The Twins first baseman Doug Mientkewitz surprised everyone tonight.. last night he was playing first base for the Twins in the Metrodome but tonight he was playing first base for the Red Sox in the Metrodome. They must have traded him in the last 24 hours. Funny. The Twins won 5-4, so it was all good. Also, these college kids behind us were extremely tanked and kept muttering random things like "I wonder what kind of bats they would use if baseballs were made of cheese" and other nonsensical things. They also thought that the Twins were playing the White Sox. Haha.  Tomorrow Billy goes home, he is my cousin who went on vacation with us this year. We always take a cousin with us on our family vacations. Along with Billy goes the loaded 2003 Dodge Caravan my Grandpa allowed us to borrow for the trip. He's not going to appreciate that we put 2000 miles on his new van in a week. Sorry gramps, but it's time for another oil change again.  That's my weekend.. band camp in t-minus 2 weeks.  I also find it interesting that love is the only thing that is easiest to find when you aren't looking for it..

      So we went on vacation. It was glorious. We saw Duluth and most of the north shore of Lake Superior and ate at 3 or 4 different pizza places in that area. Don't get me wrong, just because I spend most of my time sitting in front of a computer screen doesn't mean I don't love the outdoors. I definitely have a thing for building fires... on purpose or on accident.. *whistle*  I bought a frisbee at a trading post in Grand Marais. It's orange, and its the official ultimate frisbee weight or whatever. I think 175 grams? Oh well. Just a frisbee  Tomorrow night we are going to see the Twins play the Boston Red Sox at the Metrodome. Hopefully the Twins put on a decent performance.. I, for one, would be thoroughly overjoyed.  I have a yearning to have a LAN party soon. Chances are it will be for my 18th birthday which falls on August 18th. More details to come.  Keep it classy, Rochester.

      I think we got off on the wrong foot, sorry for being such an ass to you. I know you'll probably pound me into the ground or something for trying to apologize this late, but I just want you to know that I have always felt like our pathetic silent feud is pretty sad and dislogical. Just throwin' that out there, you don't have to reply if you don't want, although I'm sure you'd love to make fun of me some more. Sometimes I enjoy it because you are one of the very few who actually say logical things when writing comments and such. Sorry for having judged you in the past, it's not really my place to judge anyone like that.. I don't plan on doing it again. Have a nice day?

      Well, it seems   urlLink Google    prefers John Kerry over George W.&nbsp;Bush. According to my handy-dandy Google toolbar,  urlLink John Kerry's web page  ranks 8/10 on the PageRank system while  urlLink George Bush's web site  ranks only 7/10 on the PageRank scale of importance.   &nbsp; hahaha bush you got owned by google.

      Well, I was going to put up this super awesome animated picture file of myself as an update to that picture of half my face you've all been looking at for a while, but when I tried to put it in that spot it told me the file size was too big. I guess I'll just post it here for all to see: &nbsp;

      i found this awesome quote, i just started laughing out loud at it. It's not really that funny, but I think it's interesting:   If there were no God, there would be no atheists.  - Gilbert K. Chesterton

      so I'm in Eau Claire right now.. drove here myself Friday morning, I am surprised I'm still alive. Anyways, me and Jake went to see a whole bunch of movies this weekend. We saw Kill Bill 2, which I must say was the best movie I've seen this weekend; Anchorman, which is pretty funny but not as good as some other comedies I've seen; and Dodgeball, with Ben Stiller. I didn't like Dodgeball. It was too predictable, and Ben Stiller played a bad guy. I think he makes a much better good guy. But yeah, this weekend has been awesome.   By the way.. what happened to the blimeystudios domain? I can't access it from here, it redirects me to this page:  urlLink http://blimeystudios.triple7.biz/

      I went driving to Wal*Mart to get my film develeoped from the trip but it won't be back until Thursday. On the way, I realized something: I don't need to hang around with people that bring me down anymore. I was thinking about all the incredible people I've met through God's amazing presence in Wyoming as well as the friendships that have been strengthened to the max through him, and I just realized there are so many people out there that are my friends that I just take for granted.  This last week I've lived for God, and everything else just fell in place. Coincidence? I don't think so.  Welcome back.

      I just got back from the mission trip in Wyoming.  Wow.  I thought today for 13 hours what to write about this trip... there are just so many amazing things that happened ont his trip that I will never be able to explain to anybody that wasn't there with me.  However, I would love to give some huge thank yous to my new friends from Alabama, as well as old friends that have become even better friends through Christ:  Leslie, Paul, Becky, Steven, Charles, Lorie, Brian, and Kevin, thanks so much for making this the best week of my life.  Tomorrow I am going to get my pictures developed and make a web site for the trip.  I'll post it tomorrow.  Songs to remember..  "Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner, sometimes I feel like my only friend, is the city I live in, the city of Angels, lonely as I am, together we cry"  "...and I said 'what about Breakfast at Tiffany's?' I said I think I remember the film, ah, yes I recall, I think we both kinda liked it, and I said 'Well, that's one thing we've got'"  "...a wimbowet a wimbowet a wimbowet a wimbowet..."  "Ice, Ice, Baby"  "And I'd give up forever to touch you, 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow, You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be, and I don't want to go home right now" - dedicated to the Alabamians.. man, I love those southerners.  Thanks guys.. it was great being able to take off the mask for a week and just be who I've always wanted to be. Thus begins the rest of my life.

      What a crazy movie. It made me think. You should rent it. Yes. You.   Also.. Starsky and Hutch was decent. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson make a great team, but it just didn't redeem that movie. I think they just hired the cast of Zoolander to make another film due to the success of Zoolander, good idea, but it couldn't save Starsky and Hutch.

Dance Revolution      Large amounts of junk food .. i.e. cake, chips, pop, ice cream     LAN party?     Poker!     frisbee      Fire!       Pizza!         bowling           movies           conversation           riding down judd hill on a scooter barefoot           music           guitars!                                                 but I don't think I will.
