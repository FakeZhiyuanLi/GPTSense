      This poem isnt that great, but i guess its ok. I really expresses how i feel about myself. In case you cant tell, my self esteem is at ZERO at the moment.   I am  (c) Karlee Reid  I am Broken. No ones there to help me pick up the pieces of the life that you shattered so easily. I am Stereotyped. I am what they tell me I am and I can do nothing. I am Alone.  No one to hold on to anymore.  I am Helpless. in need of a strong hand to pull me to my feet again I am Myself. But even I don’t know who that is. I am Disgusting. I hate every detail of myself, every cell of my soul, ever fibre of my body.  I am Immense.  Taking up too much space in the world. I am Masked. Shielded by my own fear of this world. I am Nothing. Nothing that anyone could or would ever love, care for or wate their time on. And so I end it. All I need is courage and my little silver blade.  R.I.P, Karlee Reid I am… Dead.

      Another poem i wrote just a few days ago. I'm proud of this one too, but i'm not sure how it looks to someone who hasnt been through it. I used to cut myself frequently, and it really did help me feel better. And for all you toher teens out there who do it too, I really feel for you and i hope you can stop and i wish you the best of luck in the future and beyond. this poem was inspired by my best friend, Sarah.   Silverblade  (c)Copyright Karlee Reid  Picking up my shining friend I cut myself again Seeing blood drip off my wrist Helps to ease the pain  No one knows why I do it, They don’t understand The ecstasy that I can feel Although it’s never planned  Too many things I need to say But that they’ll never feel They’ll never know pain, or hurt or blood Without the help of steel  The cold and chill of my best friend Runs along my wrist I think of what I’m about to do And know I won’t be missed.  This is it I think, alone And hold the blade just right And look out the window into the moon And walk out into night  I hold my blade up to the moon And watch the silver gleam I plunge the blade into myself And manage not to scream  I feel the blood flow out of me The light begins to fade And I know now that I’ve  found peace With help of silver blade

      Heres a poem a wrote a few days ago, I'm pretty proud of it, considering i really feel the way i wrote.  So, enjoy this, it explains how i feel towards hiding behind something your not just to be accepted and how certain people can help that.   My Mask  (c) Copyright Karlee Reid  Smooth, Smiling Ceramic Face Covering who I am inside Making sure no one can see What I’m trying to hide  I won’t let them near my thoughts No one looks inside of me So they assume that there no mask And there’s nothing there to see.  Behind the mask I’m hollow, A pool of empty tears No one there to comfort me To help me face my fears  My mask is always smiling And though the mask can’t see I know the way I look inside My mask is mocking me.  I hate this mask, but I can’t let go Of the shield I’ve known so long I can’t help the way I feel Although I know I’m wrong.  Desperation fills me now I can’t breathe or feel or see My mask is sealing up my soul Until you smile at me  After that the mask is gone It falls down to the floor It shatters into a thousand pieces And now I hide no more.
