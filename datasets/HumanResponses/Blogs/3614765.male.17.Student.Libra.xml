      Today was the first paper of the midyr, kicking off to a start of continuous test from monday to thursday.. the questions to me are quite answerable but i had a hunch that the marks are so hard to score.. lolz..   after the exam, went for weights training.. omg~ my standard had dropped so much after the holidays.. seeing shin so piang, me feel so motivated and also cheong as much as possible, pushing on each set as much as i can..  after the weights training went down to klssc for canoeing training.. the training was quite intensive but i believe not the most intensive yet.. to my delight, laoshi had let us row our various events :> although wk was still sick today and i had to row with weiping i believe that it was quite up to standard as we aint losing much to the other k2s..  went back home for dinner and went to visit my ah gong.. my gong had slim down alot.. not the way that anyone would wants.. he is suffering for diabetes and have to go for dialysis i think 3 times a week... my ah gong, in my memory, is fat with a bloated stomach.. liked to touch his belly when i was small.. but things ahd changed drastically since then. he suffered from diabetes.. went for dialysis.. but things didnt stop there.. he began to slim down at a horrible pace.. his legs started giving way, often giving him the feeling that his is no longer able to support his ever decreasing weight.. his arm is punctured with multiple holes due to the dialysis and his treatment process.. suffering from heart problems, death seems to be like right around the corner.. often my grandma would say that my ah gong is not going to make it already.. its sad.. a kin who could leave you anytime... the tot itself is scary.. started making a point to try visiting him as much as possible.. i dun wan to live to regret that i could had make out more time for my ah gong.. he looks so frail and ill-stricken.. its not a nice scene to see...  treasure the ones you love.. spend time with them.. for they can nv be always by your side.. once lost.. its lost..

      Yo.. Juz came back from having prata.. haha.. yosep wanted to buy some prata and he came down all the way to jalan kayu to buy.. haha.. i accompanied him and dug out some things from him.. haha.. then we rode his bike to xp's hse to give her some prata to eat and then rode back to my place.. on the way.. he asked me the same question twice "why are u not ******" for those canoeist.. the answer is obvious.. haha... hope i'm not her the next time..  the feeling of riding the bike is fun.. and quite exciting... but not exciting enough due to the traffic lights along the way.. yosep: thanks for the treat and the ride.. next time we eat prata.. hope u wun have to send me home.. haha.. cos there will be someone sitting at that seat already.. jia you~! u can do it.. muz go all out.. all the best.. :P

      Today was the heats for Dragonboat Festival 2004.. I was late.. haha.. Missed many buses.. After reaching Marina Promenade, i found the place to be buzzling with activities.. Many stalls of food and stuff.. Its was noisy.   Had my warm up and went down for the 24 men heat 2.. we faced strong competition from safsa, ntu and other.. but nevertheless, we were told to do wat we are suppose to do.. if we beat safsa, we have a high chance of getting a medal. the honk was sounded and the race started off.. half way thru my sponge slipped of causing great difficulty to kick the boat and almost lost the oar to the waves as i hit the waves.. lucky i didnt.. or else there a chance of being dq. pulled away at maintance but was almost caught up at the last charge.. lucky we pulled away at the middle..  the girls came in second for 12 women and the yr 1 guys came in 3rd in their heats.. their timing was fastest 3rd, allowing them to enter the semi finals with us.  then came the 24 mixed.. i wasnt clinching to high hopes to this race.. ntu and many other strong teams had made my mind wander off for a while.. i was thinking if this is going down for fun.. but regardless of my previous thoughts i still believe i shld give in my 100% and yes i did.. surprising we pulled away again at the middle.. all thanks to laoshi's stroke and technique.. we came in first and entered the finals~!

      Training was quite good considering the high morale that we have today.. Rowed around 6 sets of 650m.. the timing was acceptable with ah Zhui and Yosep's good comments.. But of cos there are always areas that we can work on like making sure every stroke was 100% accompanied by the kicking of boat and the twisting of body.. Was highly motivated during the training despite the condition that i was in.. Panadol Actifast was good.. It took away my pain and the sickness for a short while. At least during the training.. With laoshi's comments on being able to win a medal.. We have high hopes.. Juz hoping that we can perform our best during the heats..   After training, me and xp went back to her house and cook maggie mee to eat.. haha.. was kindna broke le.. all thanks to the meal at Seoul Gardern.. lolz.. it was nice.. :D after which i felt kindna sick.. the effects of the paracetamol had worn off.. took 2 panadols and took cab home.. rest and rest.. zzz.. hope this illness will not undermine my performance tml..  Tml's the competition.. Its the heats of the Dragonboat Festival 2004 at Marina Promenade.. I'm going for the 24 men and 24 mixed competition.. Event 2 at 1.10pm and Event 17/23 at 3.40/4.40 i think.. not sure for the mixed boat..   P.S. History only remember the CHAMPS.. Runner-ups are nv remember.. I want to be remember.. I want to be the CHAMP..
