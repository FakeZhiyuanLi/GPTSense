       urlLink    Turndown photo number two. Chris Hamer with a 360 this time. Every time I see a photo of Pipeline it makes me feel gutted. I really enjoyed that place while it lasted. Loads of sessions with the Manchester boys even when I moved out of town. Only brick dust left there now. In better news the lads have aquired a few new ramps so they should be moving to a spot in town soon, hopefully the old flyover (not the christian monopoly). Two big quarters and the take-off for a box jump so far. Just need some wood for decks and a flat bank. Should keep us going over the winter!  urlLink

       urlLink    Just waiting to get some other riding photos back from the photo shop, so this is a photo of my other hobby. This was taken about a year ago when I started modifying my Jeep. It's a bit bigger now with a few more gizmos. Will post a few more photos of it soon after another trip to Wales. The park under the flyovers nearly finished, looks small but should be fun if the Christians allow the sinful sport of BMX to supplement their income. Jesus loves you if you pay enough.  urlLink

       urlLink    Another from the fly-over. I promise this is the last photo of me now. Should be getting some of the other boys tomorrow and will put up some of Chris Hamer that Jim took. I'm off to nurse my hangover now. Was great to get drunk with the boys again! urlLink

       urlLink    Riding photo No.2. Taken at pipeline (never could get used to calling it Woodhouse). All the photos I have at the moment were taken by Jim when he was doing Chris Hamers interview. Thanks alot Jim. I will be getting some more up soon when the weather improves and they wont be of me!! We're all off to Paul Harrisons wedding later on today, should be good fun. Will post some pics if I can be bothered taking my camera. Q.Can you guess what the next riding photo I post will be? Option A - a rocket barspin to one hander lander Option B - A cross up Option C - A dead sailor Not so difficult those who have seen my vast array of jumping tricks!  urlLink

       urlLink    First riding photo from under the fly-over. Didn't scan properly but it'll do. Speaking of the flyover a small park is nearly finished under another part built by the same folk who built Platt Fields. Rumour has it that it'll be run by a Christian group who aren't going to let bikes in, and charge to use it. Mmmmm.. something not very Christian about that! I bet it never crossed their minds that more skaters can fit on the park than bike riders i.e paying customers. Oops sarcasm and cynicism at the same time. Can you guess my views on religion?!  urlLink
