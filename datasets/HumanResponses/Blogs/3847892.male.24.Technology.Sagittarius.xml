      The campness of this whole place is incredible. It reeks of machonism without any reason what so ever (i.e. the people here just WANT to bleed, sweat and die for their country), has a foul sense of what's decent bedtiems (getting up at six in the morning and going to bed at elleven), and finally it is boring.   We did get our AG3's handed out yesterday, so I'm running around with a bad ass gun. Not really cool. What IS interesting is the mechanic principles in the trigger section as well as the composites used to make it. Pertty nifty to study and take apart. I can just about demantle it in forty seconds now and I really couldn't care less. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WTF????????????   All the kids learn what a bullet looks like, what gunpowder is, safekeeping of the gun, etc. Pretty boring as my dad brought me up with a rather good sense of proper weapon care and handling. What was funny though was when Andre forgot to lock his locker; I took his AG3 and put it into mine to teach him a lesson and get him to never forget locking his locker. Man,&nbsp;he got so scared. His whole face went winter-white-pale when he realized it was gone and he stood there frozen a good ten seconds before he stormed of to the troop chief. Fortunatly I did get hold of him and told him about the prank. All of us in the room had a really good laugh and still, five hours later, he's still shaking. HAHAHAHA.   That's it for now. MidnightHacker, hate you. I'll still give you a phone somtime.   ciao boys,  svenni

      So, the big ugly monster refused my equest for deferrments after i got a job. Ok, so the job was crap, low paid and no possibilities for advancemnet. BUT, it WOULD have be a good temporary job. We all have to start somewhere, right? Could possibly get another job withint two months and be sorted. So, now I´m in the royal bootcamp of campness and boringness with all the lads (aka. neds) who think shooting with guns are a GOOD thing and that the king is ALSO a GOOD thing. Right.  Perhaps I´m overreacting. There´s quite a few chaps here that are nice and decenet and cool. However, this place has in fact stripped me of freedom, although they try to help you. Still, I don´t like it. Have got verbal confirmation that I will be transferred, but don´t know when. Probably still have to roll around in mud. Martin, if you ever read this, I know you´re laughing.  Hope everyone else is good. I´m not. Miss my girlfriend terribly terribly much. Norway has got nothing more for me except my best friends and immediate family. And nice and health food. And bootiful scenery. And perhaps good houses. And IBM is here. But, N.S. sucks.  bye from the soldier. Don´t mind the selling mistakes, I´m writing on an apple machine with a super crap key board. Noone´s heard about proper setup of computer equipment to avoid damage to your wrists and back.

      As I attended graduation last year I wasn't allowed to attend graduation this year. Apparently you're only allowed to do that once as you can only be accepted into the "society of the knowledgeable" once. Can't join twice. Darn.  It was sooo nice to see them all dressed up in their black robes, golden hoods with red linings, etc etc. Very funky. They were all smiling at first but then, gradually, the smile were replaced by "have-to-smile-smiles", as parents were pretty much on high demand for photos. Wish I had brought my camera too even if mates might have smashed it in a rebellion against the photos.  Nice to see my name in the list of graduates with a BaSci (Hons). Been working hard for it so I was pretty chuffed.  Had some rum later in the day as parents celebrated last year with me.  Again, congrats to all you graduates and friends out there!  Svenni

      So here it is, my lil' blog. The scene of unholy death and evil destruction. Yeah, I know, that did indeed sound like a fourteen year old kid that just watched some sad sad RPG movie. I DO in fact enjoy RPG, have played it since I was siz, just like computer games. To avoid the sad computer geek/RPG picture you now have of me, I have also been travelling to a few very exciting countries and I love various forms of art, especially the impressionist style of painting. A good hour of Qincy Jones and other jazz would also do just fine.  I'll post more later.  Svenni
