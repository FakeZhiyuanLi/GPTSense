        Just sitting here on my lunch break. Checking stuff out on ebay. It's a very busy day today, but then every day is like this lately. I have to get Eli at day care today then I think I'll cut the grass in the front today since it's going to rain the rest of the week. Today is going pretty good so far. I wish the rain would stop so I can the house finished, at least the parts that I am doing. Well I better get back to work.

       Well another day of just catching up on work around the house. I finally got my clothes put away and my room cleaned. Emptyed all the litter boxes and cleaned them also. the only thing left is cutt the grass and maybe work on starting the second coat of CWF on the garage. I have someone coming at the end of the month to do the top of the garage andthe top of the road side of the house and the whole other side of the house. All the other parts I have gotten the first coat on. As long aas I stay busy then I don't have time to think about them. What are they doing and how much fun they are having laughing behind my back about how they got one over on me and how they made me pay big time. Well I may have been paid back but time will tell for them. Like they say you can't treat someone like garbage and it's not going to come back 3 fold to you. You can't dog someone and break their heart and step on them like they are nothing and it will not come back to haunt you. They may be the happy couple now but it will not last because it is just the way it is. They will see. Someone will come along and dog them like they dogged me and then they will see how it feels to be totally torn apart and left to be in pain. I am working so hard on moving on in my life. It has been a very hard road to walk but I am getting better every day. Thats not to say I don't have bad days still because just thinking of them together and what they have put me through is the worst. But like people have told me, it was just a matter of time before it happened because I am finding out now just how mant people knew what was going on with them but didn't want to get involved. I have had people come to me that they would never even think would. I have been told about all the times they were seen at each others house and all the times Chris stayed at her house behind my back. Yes and all this was going on when we were together but then I was also told that she concidered us not being together about a year before she told me to get lost. How funny is that. Yeah all the weekends I was staying there she was just using me. Now I know why we slept in different rooms. It all adds up now.What a fool I was always running back to her and kissing ass just so her and Chris could laugh behind my back. I never imagined some of the things I have been told was going on. These are credible people to because they were close enough to see what was going on the whole time. Even the tiimes Chris and I just missed passing each other. God all I had to do was go back to her house for something or make a surprise visit. Oh well I need to quit thinking about it because like I said they will get theirs some day. They will get treated as they have treated me. I don't go no where because of the chance of running into them. My daughter said if she is with me and they say one word to me she is going to tell them both off. This comes from Elizabeth not Tanya. Elizabeth absalutly hates Bernie for what she has done. She has nothing nice to say about her. Now it's time for me to start living again and forget about them and all their dirty deeds. I will find someone to love me for me and not want or need their ex in their life to keep them happy. If I could do it all over again boy would I have ran away from Bernie the day I met her. People tryed to warn me but nooooooooo I just let myself fall in Love with her only to get kicked in the teeth by both of them. I guess you could say I really am an ass for letting myself be takin in be all the crap and lines and I love you's when it was all a game. But I have to admit they had a good game going for a long time. I was just at the expence of my heart and tearing my world apart. But it is a world that I am slowly rebuilding, well at least I'm trying to but first I have to get over all this anger and hurt and frustration of being cheated on and stepped on and then tossed like garbage. It has been 6 months and 16 days since that deadful night. I still can't believe she let me go out in the snow storm all upset and crying without one bit of concern for Eli or weather I was in an acccident or not. Me I can understand because she had what she wanted in her life but to not even think about a little boy who she supposedly cared about is unforgivable. That I will never forgive her for, till the day I die. Well I gotta get things done.

        Another long day at work. Still working 10 hour days. Now working my part time job on Saturdays. Well it's been 6 months since Bernie dumped me for her ex girl friend Chris. I guess I never really knew what a game player Bernie really was untill this all happened. I guess I should of known it was going to happen. I was always catching them together under the pretension that nothing happened. I guess she thought I was stupid. You don't just start a relationship with your ex if you have been away from each other for 5 years. They were always together it was just done so underhandedly behind my back. I have to admit they were good at cheating on me for the last few years with out me catching them. I never thought she was so evil and cold hearted. But I have since found out she is a very cold heartless woman. I found out so many things from people that even I wouldn't have thought thay were doing behind my back. They had it good. I wouldn't let her have me and Chris so she had to make a decision and it wasn't me. I wouldn't bow down and kiss her ass like Chris will. Now she has her right where she has wanted her since before we got together.I think all I was , was just the game piece to get Chris tob e what she wanted her to be
