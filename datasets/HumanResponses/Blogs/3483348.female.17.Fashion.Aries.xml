      Gavin DeGraw  I don't need to be anything other Than a prison guard's son I don't need to be anything other  Than a specialist's son I don't have to be anyone other Than the birth of two souls in one Part of where I'm going, is knowing where I'm coming from I don't want to be Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately All I have to do Is think of me and I have peace of mind I'm tired of looking 'round rooms Wondering what I've got to do Or who I'm supposed to be I don't want to be anything other than me I'm surrounded by liars everywhere I turn I'm surrounded by imposters everywhere I turn I'm surrounded by identity crisis everywhere I turn Am I the only one who noticed? I can't be the only one who's learned I don't want to be  Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately All I have to do Is think of me and I have peace of mind I'm tired of looking 'round rooms Wondering what I've got to do  Or who I'm supposed to be I don't want to be anything other than me Can I have everyone's attention please? If you're not like this and that, you're gonna have to leave I came from the mountain The crust of creation My whole situtaion-made from clay to stone And now I'm telling everybody I don't want to be Anything other that what I've been trying to be lately All I have to do Is think of me and I have peace of mind I'm tired of looking 'round rooms Wondering what I've got to do Or who I'm supposed to be I don't want to be anything other than me I don't want to be

      Shouldve never told u  That I cared about u  Didnt think tha it would be, so bad  Shouldve never kissed u  Shouldve never held ur hand  How could u tell me tha u liked me When I know u were just tryin to play me  But u'r the fool  bc I kno how 2 switch the game up on u  And n the end I kno who will lose  I played this game before  And I cant play no more  Wha do u take me for  Its not what u thought  So dont play games w me  bc I play to teach  Its not tha serious  I never put tha much thought into us  It wasnt that I loved you  I was curious  Who did u think tha u were involved w  Now babe u should kno tha it aint tha serious  It should concern u tha Im always 1 step ahead of u  So tha should let u kno tha wha u do  Ive done before, its nothin new  So run those games on someone who cant be fooled  I can almost see lies coming through ur teeth  In every word u speak u make it clear to me  Tha u're playin wrong n ur game aint strong  Ive been in this 2 long, so just be moving on  Got to find a way to let these feelings go

      As we try to just be friends  I often think of what could've been However, I feel as though my heart will never mend. i wonder where we went wrong,  our relationship sounds like so many sad songs will u ever see what u meant to me? will u ever miss, what we had? or do the memories just make u mad? i try so hard to move on but i dont want to realize that u r really gone. y cant we make it together, u and me? Am i not good enough? y cant u just be w me? I think of the days when u held me tight I felt like everything, was going to be alright. But all of the sudden, we started to fight. And our feelings for each other were soon outta sight. I hope that one day u will see that u lost everything... ...when u lost ME!!!

      I seriously dont understand! I seriously do not understand this whole relationship thing! I mean... somewhere along the way i must have missed a clue! I must have skipped a sign....cause seriously i have no idea about what a relationship is consist of!!!  If u like a guy and u really want it to work out.... be almost sure that IT WONT happen!! And if u dont really care bout it, be positive that he'll come around!! well... i just figured since im so bad at figuring things out that i would just not try at all!! Thats were i got it all wrong!! Things seem to be even more complicated once u have no intention to make it a big deal! I was trying to take life not as serious... i was just trying to have fun! It seems that i was lookin for fun in the wrong place!!  I thought u were lookin for the samething as me... apparently not! Why did u have to expect sooooo much from me? im sorry but as i said... i was just trying to enjoy life! Im sorry if i didnt feel the samething as u did but as i told u... dont expect much from me!!! I thought u were passed all this drama...but i just realized drama will always be there! And it is so ironic that U were the one that got so involved!!! Im sorry baby...but i think u should go for another person!!! U should go for someone as jealous and so emotionally out of balance AS U!!! And im sorry...ILL BE THE BIGGER PERSON...yes... ILL BE THE BIGGER PERSON AND TELL U THE TRUTH... ILL TELL U WHAT IM FEELING....(ISNT THAT WHAT U ALWAYS WANTED?)    IM FEELING SOMETHING IVE NEVER FELT FOR ANYONE ELSE....                              ....IM FEELING DISCUSSTED BY U!!!!!                                               (SORRY...U WANTED TO HEAR THE TRUTH!)

      What I choose to do is of no concern to you and your friends Where I lay my hat may not be my home, but I will last on my own 'Cause it's me, and my life it's my life... Oh the world has sat in the palm of your hand not that you'd see and I'm tired and bored of waiting for you and all those things you never 'Cause it's me, and my life it's my life...
