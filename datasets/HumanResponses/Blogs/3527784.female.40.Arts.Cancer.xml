           Alien X-ING News- 1st Edition-   SPIRIT    Always help others that cannot help themselves. Help someone if they ask you, CARE and do it because it makes you feel good.     Feed spirit with all the good things you can do. It will come back to you. It is in your Karma. If you feed your spirit your eyes will open up and you will see more. You will have more opportunity, more money, more friends, more contacts, more of everything that is good. This will also help with creating a positive energy shift in the planet.    The planet is alive and it is powered by you. What we do will make the difference in what happens in the world, by simply changing your attitude and making a commitment to improve your own life and surroundings.
