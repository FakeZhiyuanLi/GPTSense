       So what's up.  This is the first posting in the first blog created by the First Lady of Lame, me!  So listen up.  I hate all of you.  Except for maybe a few people.  I am so mad at everything.  Die, penguin, die.  Bloody fruitcake black suit-and-tie carrot fool.  Jenny's the name, nonsense is my game.  Go ahead, ask me a question.  I'll answer it with the lamest answer possible.  I hope you hate me now.  Everybody else does!  I don't know.  I need to sleep.  Goodnight.

      So hey everybody, it's your favorite freak, me! Well, maybe I'm not your favorite but we'll just pretend for now. As long as your in my friggin blog you're going to be my best friend. Ugh, I dunno, I'm tired and also very bored. I need some friends, dammit!   Well, in my continuing research of my stupid, pointless love life, I have realized the following things:   1. I am incredibly&nbsp;repulsive and hideous.&nbsp;  2. Guys are afraid of me and don't like me, so they wouldnt even think about dating me   3. No girl would EVER have a reason to be jealous of me   4. Nobody wants to go out with a freaky, pale, extremely demented weirdo girl   5. Every guy I have ever liked never liked me back...at all   6. My sister is 12 and has had more boyfriends than I, a 15-year-old, have had   Well, that's all I can think of for now, maybe some more later if I'm feeling especially depressed. Goodbye, dipshits.

      I just want everybody who reads this (who is nobody so whatever) to know that I am going to take this lame ass blog down if people don't start commenting!  Now, I realize that this is a very non-threatening threat, however, I have nothing to back that up so I'm just going to sit here on eating fruit pies and wallowing in my own self-pity while you all enjoy being the twig-like, bitchy I-can-get-any-guy-I-want bitches that you all are.  I hate you.  Get away from me.

      Well you knew it would happen eventually...I've got my very own club!  So far I've only got 2 members including myself, but there's always room for more people.  There are only a few qualities a member of my club must have:  1.  You must at least hate your father, but both parents is also acceptable 2.  You must have an idea for what the club should officially be called 3.  You must be at least this tall to ride BATMAN 4.  You must be on my list of people I don't hate; I haven't yet made one in writing  Okay, so if you want to join my club, send me an email telling me.    Cfreak123@aol.com is my email address.  You blow.  Don't think being in my club makes you cool.  It totally does not.  But at least now I might wave to you every once in a while because I hate you less than I hate most people.  Good day to you.  No, screw that.  BAD day to you.

      Hello people.&nbsp; I haven't posted in a little while so I'm going to now.&nbsp; I mean, it's not like anybody even reads this, but I still like to pretend sometimes that people care.&nbsp; Anyway, I don't have anything to say because nothing really happened.&nbsp; Oh, and by the way--Saint Edward's Central&nbsp;Catholic High School blows ass.&nbsp; That is all.

      Hey, so, yeah I have a new member in my club!&nbsp; But&nbsp;that's&nbsp;not really important&nbsp;because I almost forced her to join.&nbsp; Anyway, if you want to join, it's very easy to be in my club, all you gotta do is tell me you want to be in and you're in.&nbsp;   Send me a damn email:&nbsp;  urlLink Cfreak123@aol.com   If you're still skeptical about joining my FREE free club, here are some reasons why you should join.    It's free  It might be fun  ME!&nbsp; C'mon, you like me, don't you?&nbsp; DON'T YOU?.....  It's totally free  The club will get better with time and more people in it  You will be able to say you joined a club and didn't even have to do anything except email somebody   It's fuckin free!  You will break my fragile heart if you don't join...   So there you go.&nbsp; I know you want to join.&nbsp; C'mon, maybe we'll all get free candy and little flags and a parade!&nbsp; Or maybe not.&nbsp; But so what.&nbsp; Well, later.  &nbsp;

      Hi people. It's been a little while since I last posted. Like anyone cares. Like anybody is even reading this. Well what if I told you that I have a boyfriend? Ooh, what would you say? Nothing, because you don't know anything. Idiot. What a lame remark. Oh well, I am lame.

      DUDE.  I have a boyfriend!  No lie, no joke, I am totally fuckin telling the truth.  And it rocks!  Finally, after all this shitty time of being alone...I am unalone!  Happy, happy, happy me.  But I won't tell you his name, because then the magic would be spoiled.  So you will never know!  Ha ha ha ha.  Just know that this dorkwad is UNAVAILABLE.  Sorry you idiots, you weren't fast enough.  AH HA HA HA!  I'm nuts.  Deal with it.

      Yeah so I'm going to California on Saturday.  I won't be here for a WHOLE WEEK.  Whee, going to see grandma.  How great.  I know you'll miss me.  But it's so close to being school time again, that going is really gonna be shitful.  I mean I want to go, but I also want to just stay home and not do anything until school starts.  Oh yeah, school blows.  Anyway, I'm going to miss you all.  WHAT THE FUCK????  I did not just say that.  I won't miss you at all, except for like 2 people.  Goodbye, assbags.  Ha ha, Ashley I stole your word.  BITCH.
