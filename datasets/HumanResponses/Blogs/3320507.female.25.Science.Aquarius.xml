           Chapter Two in the book the Tracks We Leave, Ethics in Healthcare Management by Frankie Perry demonstrates that standing firm in ones beliefs can be truly difficult. The chapter presents a situation where a successful organization is planning to construct a $12 million corporate office complex. The building and grounds committee of the organization established selection criteria for possible contractors and set a strict bid deadline. When it came time to vote on the bids a member of the committee who had been extensively involved with one of the contractors of interest convinced the committee to post pone the vote till a final bid is submitted by each prospective contractor.  The individual believed that one of contactors had made a mistake in its calculations in relation to costs and needs to be given the opportunity to correct the mistake and resubmit its bid. The chief operating officer of the organization recognized this as an unethical act, specifically a conflict of interest. The officer consulted the HMO’s attorney, CEO, and the ethical committee of the organization on the issue. All expressed that there was neither a legal nor ethical problem with the committee’s decision. With no one to fight with him or the ability to relocate jobs at the current time, the officer kept his mouth shut and allowed the committee to proceed with their decision. Though the officer did not press the issue any further, the actions that he did carry out damaged his relationships with the CEO and members of the committee. In the end the man regrets not standing by his principles.      The chapter shows the reality of how fighting for your beliefs can be a challenging and sometimes unrewarding task. The officer in the story found himself in a situation where he was the only one that recognized the unethical implications of the committee’s decision. When he was faced with the choice of resigning or leaving the issue alone, his current life status forced him to do the latter. Once the issue had blown over the officer experienced great guilt for not standing his ground. I believe the lesson learned in this story can be summed up in the old saying, “To thy own self be true.” This is the basis of ethics. If we are not able to be true to ourselves then how can we ever be true to the people we serve.

      Blog 2 Medical Errors     In the book The Tracks We Leave: Ethics in Healthcare Management by Frankie Perry, the ethical issues of medical errors is discussed in chapter one. The situation presented in the chapter states; “twenty-two oncology patients at a well-established hospital received radiation therapy dosages in excess of what had been prescribed for them. The error had occurred due to a flaw in the calibration of the equipment.” The chapter continues to express that the medical staff and CEO all agreed that informing the patients of the error would cause more harm than good. The board of trustees disagreed and believed that it is the patients’ right to be informed of the error regardless of the outcome.     The situation is a useful example that portrays the sensitivity and complexity of medical errors, and how health providers react to such events. From pre-school and on we teach children to always tell the truth because, “the truth will set you free”. Truthfulness is instilled and encouraged in all of us at a very young age; so why do the rules change when it comes to our health? An individual’s health and wellness is the most imperative facet of life and should be valued by health care providers with the utmost respect. So, what gives health care providers the right to pick and choose what to disclose to patients about their personal wellbeing? Are health care providers anymore human then the patients that they have the power to control such an important aspect of a person’s life?  Definitely not, the health provider should view the patient as an equal. I believe high quality health care should begin with a clear understanding between the patient and the provider that care will be centered on absolute honesty. Patients should be made aware of all options, possibilities, treatments, and, risks; and partake in continuous communication with their providers. If an error takes place it is the essential responsibility of the provider to inform the patient despite the consequences. We all only have one life to live and it is critical we do not live in the dark when it comes to our healthcare.

           The various ethical decision making frameworks all possess the fundamental characteristics of individual awareness and alertness. Each framework portrayed that ethical decision making is set in motion by the action of recognizing ethical predicaments. It is the responsibility of the members of an organization to be alert to ethical situations within their surroundings. This skill is the initial force to sustaining a valued work force, which ultimately produces quality services for consumers.      I believe the ability to recognize an ethical problem is achieved in several ways. First and foremost, members of an organization must be aware and accepting of the differences among the people they work with. It is vital that people in an organization understand that what may seem moral or right to them may be unethical to another. Ethical conflicts between employees can be solved or all together avoided if colleagues have a true understanding of each other. Honest and trusting relationships between employees set the foundation for ethical and moral performance, thus creating a strong and lasting organization.   In addition, members must be aware of the diversity among their consumers or customers. A common standard of respect and behavior must be applied for all customers and situations. This can be achieved through training, role playing, and interactive workshops.     Lastly, members of an organization must be thoroughly knowledgeable of their particular field and fully aware of the legal policy involved. I believe it is impossible for an individual to detect an ethical dilemma without proper education and available expert resources. Knowledge is power and is the number one factor in determining right from wrong.

           In the book The Tracks We Leave, Ethics in Healthcare Management by Frankie Perry a quite appalling case is presented in chapter four. The case involves a well-respected trauma surgeon arriving at the hospital for an emergency drunk. The OR supervisor advised the physician to not partake in the surgery. As a result of the surgeon being intoxicated the inexperienced resident on staff handled the emergency. A local reporter caught wind of the occurrence and wanted the hospital to give its side of the story before going to the newspaper.        I believe that the hospital needs to be honest with the reporter, but also protect the hospital’s reputation. They should not deny the situation but should not confirm anything either. If I were to answer the reporter this is what I would say, “ There was a situation where a resident had to perform an emergency surgery. The hospital is very confident in the young doctor’s skills and the resident’s performance during the surgery was that of an experienced surgeon. The hospital takes much pride in the top quality residents that practice within the facility. The hospital cannot confirm why the on call trauma surgeon was not present during the surgery but a full investigation will be conducted and appropriate actions will be executed.”     The trauma surgeon must be brought before the medical staff peer review board and disciplinary actions must be taken. Possible probation and observation periods are proper measures to take. The physician must understand the severity of the situation and recognize that it cannot happen again or termination will be considered. The OR supervisor should be commended on the way she dealt with the situation.

         In the book The Tracks We Leave, Ethics in Healthcare Management by Frankie Perry presents a gender discrimination situation in chapter three. The situation involves a 42-year-old male CEO of a community hospital and a young female postgraduate fellow. The chapter describes that for the past six months the CEO and fellow have worked hand in hand successfully. As the fellowship was drawing to a close the young fellow hoped to be rewarded the post fellowship position, but was not. The CEO explained that "Her performance was outstanding, her professionalism had been noticed by many, and she was a brilliant strategists. But he said, he was personally attracted to her and he felt this attraction was reciprocated and he believed that if they continued to spend time together this attraction would escalate to a physical relationship.” The fellow was outraged, shocked, and most certainly uncomfortable. The fellow filed a complaint with the governing board for sexual harassment.      I completely agree with the fellow in the story. The CEO was completely out of line and acted in an unethical manner. His conduct was intolerable and I believe he treated the fellow as a second-class employee. He assumed that she felt the same way as him and utterly embarrassed her. The CEO perceived the fellow’s admiration and thankfulness as flirtation and attraction. As an executive the CEO should have been able to control his personal feelings toward the fellow, and allowed her equal opportunity to receive the post fellowship position.  I believe that the proper punishment for the CEO’s behavior is termination from the organization. He needs to learn that though a woman may complement him and think highly of him, it does not imply she is personally attracted to him.

      In the book the Tracks We Leave: Ethics in Healthcare Management by Frankie Perry, chapter seven addresses the important principle that in order for managers to manage ethically they must direct their staff to work together morally. The author expresses that the manager essentially sets the standard of ethical behavior for his or her organization through many different means. First, the manager’s individual behavior has great influence on the staff. The manager’s actions usually shape the actions of the staff. In addition, the chapter emphasizes that it is the responsibility of the manager to nurture ethical relationships, a cooperative culture, and respectful conduct with in their organization. The author notes that if the above characteristics are established among the staff then the same characteristics will carry over to how the staff deals with customers.  Further, the chapter discusses the importance of teambuilding. The author stresses that mangers must invest time and effort in teambuilding exercises and seminars. Additional, the author touches on other valuable duties of the manager, such as fair performance evaluation processes and ethical firing procedures.

           In the book The Tracks We Leave: Ethics in Healthcare Management by Frankie Perry, chapter six discusses how legal and ethical implications intertwine and sometimes repel eachother in healthcare. Perry quotes an anonymous author that clearly characterizes the ambiguous relationship between what’s legal and what’s ethical. The quote states, “Illegal actions may be unethical. Unethical actions may be legal.” The chapter openly explains the challenging ordeal of balancing the ethical and legal elements of situations while equally addressing both. The author communicates to the reader the difficult task lawyers have when bearing in mind the legal and ethical sides of healthcare cases. The author examines each of the cases in the book (as discussed in my previous blogs) and identifies the ethical and legal aspects in each. The chapter highlights the important legal and ethical responsibilities of each of the characters involved in the cases, which may have not been apparent to the reader. An example of this is from blog five. The author states that, “the OR supervisor had the legal duty to contact the second on- call trauma surgeon when the original trauma surgeon did not arrive in a timely manner.” In addition, “the supervisor had the ethical duty to report the intoxication of the trauma surgeon to her superior.” This was an excellent chapter because it encouraged the reader to look at the cases from all angles. It taught the reader to evaluate all the components of the cases and discover the hidden ethical and legal dilemmas present.

             In the book The Tracks We Leave: Ethics in Healthcare Management by Frankie Perry, chapter five presents a hospital experiencing financial and staffing difficulties that depicts the nation’s overall economic crisis in healthcare.  The hospital in the case states that they spend on the average $45,000 in salary and benefits per employee per year.The CFO of the hospital expressed, “Reduction in the workforce is the safest and best know method of reducing financial deficiencies.” The president of Nursing and the vice president for Medical Affairs responded to the CFO by stating that “patient care cannot be compromised and that inappropriate reductions could have a critical impact on the clinical capability and reputation of the organization.” Thus, the CFO is faced with the challenge to find an alternative way to cut cost and balance the budget.        I suggest that the CFO explore other benefit options for his employees. There might possibly be a benefit package available that offers equivalent quality to the existing package but at a lesser cost. In addition, the CFO needs to form committees to evaluate all areas of the facility to identify where equipment, supplies, reagents, and space are being wasted. Inventory control and management is definitely an area where money can be saved. Lastly, I would suggest the CFO investigates the percentage of employees in relation to need for all shifts and positions throughout the hospital. He needs to identify where and when there is overstaffing and understaffing. Overstaffing is unproductive and cost draining,where is understaffing is costly because of overtime compensation. Continuous and appropriate staffing management would certainly cut cost.
