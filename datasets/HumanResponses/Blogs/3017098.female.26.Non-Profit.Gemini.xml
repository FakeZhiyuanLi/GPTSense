						   deciding on a label...  emopomo?  i'm in love with the indie/emo scene, and wondering about the whole "post modern" label.  post modern, emergent, alternative.  buzz words.  but emopomo has a cute little ring to it.  emopomo emopomo...hard to type.  : )  <>

						   sick of the office.  sick of the same 7 outfits every week.  i just wore this last tuesday.  don't care, no one notices but me.  i want to be outside.  that's so strange, because i was not much of an outside person when i was younger.  now i want to be out walking around, taking pictures, breathing in the sweet air that is around where i live...  i am thankful i have only 1.5 hours left in the office today.  then the car ride home...hopefully i'll be able to go for a walk tonight.  thank You for the air outside!  <>

						   i have been listening to chillout - a time to worship.  it's a collection of some popular worship songs that have been remixed...it's great.  very relaxing, as you would expect by the title.    i have decided to use the rest of lent to quit complaining, and to not be so quick to anger.  i've noticed a trait in my co-worker that really bothers me.  i told myself it's because her soul is black.  how can i say that about someone without examining my own?  i found that mine is blacker than black...there are certain people i hate for no reason.  i want to ask for help in not allowing things to get to me.  i want to be slow to anger, quick to love.  slow to speak and quick to listen.  hopefully He will give me the patience i so need.   <>

						   i've been reading a bunch of blogs again today...seriously - can this be an addiction?  i can't get enough!  i read one, and then that will have a link to another, so i read that one and have to go back and read the archives...i'm a sucker for reading...  i feel like crap today - on the verge of puking practically all day.  i didn't eat breakfast just in case i would puke.  i ate my frozen waffles for lunch and they stayed down, but made the nausea come back.  then i ate a stupid piece of birthday cake...now i feel tired and wanna go home!!!  and it's only 3:17!!!  rar.

						   in the past few weeks i have spent more time reading blogs and looking at photoblogs than i have actually worked at work...bad news if anyone i work with ever reads this.    i want to just give up my imperfections and let Him take over...then 5 minutes later i'm acting human again...  i use these (...)  a lot...i guess most thoughts in my head are left incomplete.    that's all for now.  hopefully this will be a theraputic venture.  <>

						   heavy heart...  so many regrets for not keeping in touch - a life ended way too soon.  this easter season has been all about death.  the anniversary of my papa dying, an old friend in a coma and soon to be transferred to hospice.  hospice is such a bittersweet place.  they care so much, but the end is always the same.    Father, please grant peace to Jen.  Let her pass in comfort into your arms where she will no longer cry, fear, doubt or grieve.  Hold close Abby, Jo, Mike and Stan.  Help them to accept that their sister, daughter, and wife will soon live with You.  Amen.  i so long for the day when we will no longer know pain.  Jesus, please come back soon.    Lord, please help me understand, because i am struggling with all of this right now.   <>

						   argh.  our kids are so complacent sometimes.  i get very frustrated.  we talk and share life experiences and bring in interesting and even shocking things for them to watch/hear...and they just sit there.  "God."  "Jesus"  "Because He died for us..."  those are the answers we get when we ask questions.  they know the right answers, but do they REALLY feel Him?  i mean really *REALLY* feel Him?  because i think being fake about your faith is worse than not having any at all...  how do we reach them?  is it enough that we are there and plan a lesson and show them God's Word every week?  do we need to see some spark (at the very least) or should we just keep going and pray that somewhere down the road when the shittiness of life hits them they will remember Who is there?  i think at times just for our own peace of mind we need one or more of them to get excited.  they get excited about worldly stuff - just ask the guys "who wants to play 8 person Halo?" and see them jump...ask the girls about their dance concert or the newest guy at work/school and they light up.    why do we live in a place where talking about God is uncomfortable?  people DIE in other countries for professing their faith.  these kids seem to be oblivious.  sunday is a time for talking through church, grabbing a donut and going to youth group - where they listen to music, talk to their friends, and then become comatose for the next 40 minutes while we are practically screaming for them to see what we see.  i hope that we get some leaders out of this batch of seniors.  kids who will step up and show how "cool" God is...or rather that He is in EVERY MINUTE of our lives...no distinction between "real" life and "church" life is needed.  you CAN live the way He wants you everyday without looking like a freak...  i hope spirit west coast will at least be a fun trip where we can all connect again.  i feel very stressed about these kids.  i know they will go away, and i doubt we'll ever have an entire class who is on fire and wants to actively do something with their faith, but please Lord, just show me one of them in this class.  one who will say "i want to do a mission - feed the poor, clean a gutter..."  our mission project for the next 18 months seems like less of a mission.  i know we are helping her while her husband is away, but that shouldn't be the end of our mission.  we should be working in our community.  thinking of things that we can do daily to serve each other.  i read in another blog "wipe the toilet seat off even though you didn't make the mess."  now, that sounds a bit gross, but it shows total servant heart.  no one else will know you did it.  very selfless - who wants to wipe off pee (or worse!) from a public bathroom?  but if you don't do it, maybe the next person in the stall won't see it...  i actually really like that idea.  maybe i'll work on a list of things we can do to serve someone else...  i guess it's similar to the whole democracy.  so many complacent people in america who do not vote.  (i am guilty - especially on the local level)  others don't have the right - we take ours for granted or throw it away.    what the hell is wrong with us?  dammit.      <>

						   death sucks.  i just read a story.  now i start to think about what i will do when my cats die.  they are barely one.  we got them just after my grandpa died.  it will be a year in 10 days.   he had been sick for months - years really.  but oh such a strong and stubborn man.  and such a joker...endless "thumping pains" and "snapping pains" and "does your face hurt?"s and the straw flower pot holder hat...  then october.  sick at the cabin, taken to the hospital.  when they came back down to the valley he was still sick.  he'd get better for a little while.  i remember still getting annoyed by the little things.  not wanting to hear the organ.  his tv is too loud.  why do we keep this dog that barks incessantly?  then on february 14th - very very early in the morning i awoke to the sound of his jigsaw.  special valentines created of wood...one left for me in an envelope, and one framed and left for my grandma on top of the tv.  then he really got sick.  one morning i was getting ready for work.  as i selfishly ran out the door i noticed that he was on the floor and my grandma was covering his legs with an afgan.  i thought he was just cold.  he sometimes would lay on the floor, but this was too early for fun with the dog.  not thinking, i smiled at him and walked out the door.  my aunt calls me a few hours later...he's been taken to the hospital.  we're not sure - this time it's bad.  i start to shake and tell my boss and i'm out the door and in a minute it seems i arrive at mesa lutheran.  he's been here countless times before.  we wait in the er for an hour.  my mom, aunt, grandma, and three uncles are here.  i feel like an odd man out, selfishly participating when it's not really my place...i'm just the granddaughter.  but they don't complain.  we wait some more and decide to get some lunch.  that's what we do best.  we know all of the good places to eat, and we always go out when someone is in the hospital.    lunch is good.  el charro.  i haven't been here in years - really probably more like 15.  my uncles and aunt and mom all laugh and joke and play like they are all kids again.  we accidentally lock craig in the back of the suburban.  laughing hysterically we enter the hospital.  he's been moved to icu.  we sober up and make the walk to the back of the hospital.  he's only able to see us one at a time.  i let them all go first, because i am just the granddaughter.  when i walk in he is in his skivies sitting on the bed, chest heaving, struggling to breathe.  i sit next to him and hold him for a minute.  i tell him i'm sorry - that i just thought he was cold.  he kind of laughs and holds my hand and then tells me he's getting tired.  i kiss his scratchy cheek and tell him "i love you papa."  he says so back and i leave.    that was in february.  now it's march and after in and out of hospitals and numerous ambulance rides back and forth, they all decide a nursing home will be best.  i'm furious with grandma because she's worried about money.  we go to see him at the first place.  it's ok, but oh so depressing.  this is not for my papa.  i bring killer the dog because he misses his master.  he jumps on the bed and licks his feet and for a minute he's ok.  then we have to leave...leave my papa with the old man roommate who can't even feed himself.  my papa is making small talk with the man but the man doesn't know.  oh why do we leave him here?  now he's back in the hospital.  a "better" one.  valley lutheran - the heart hospital.  he gets an angiogram and i go to visit after work.  he doesn't expect me, and is glad when i walk into the room.  he is embarassed...out of his element.  he's always in control.  now there's a nurse who tells him "don't move.  you must lie perfectly still flat on your back for another 2 hours..."  i feel terrible.  i stay for awhile and get uncomfortable and kiss him goodbye and go home.  now he's coming home.  the other nursing home was worse.  i have to call from work and find him a hospital bed.  my cousin's husband and brother-in-law come to get the big bed.  my gramma goes to the hospital to be with my papa.  i stay and wait for the new bed.  they deliver it, but it's completely manual.  we can't have it - no one here is strong enough to crank it.  they come back the next day to take the old one away and replace it with an electric model.  it's nice, for a hospital bed.    he comes home.  he can't go to the bathroom by himself, he's too weak.  my grandma calls my cousin to help.  again, papa is humiliated.  the next morning on my way out to work he has to ask for my help.  "can you help me lie down again?  your grandma is tired, i don't want to wake her"  he's been sitting on the side of the bed for who knows how long.  i help him swing his feet back onto the bed and search through the blankets for his remote control.  "here it is - do you need anything else?"  i have to run - a kiss on the cheek and a quick hug and i'm gone.  how i wish i could have stayed there and listened to his stories all day long.   but i can't.  i have to go to work.    another trip to a different nursing home and many more trips to the hospital.  we've been dancing around the issue of faith for a long time.  he's not one to share, not on this subject.  we rejoice when he calls for pastor gary by name.  my soul is at rest, but my heart is preparing to grieve.  it's april 11.  i am at work.  i hate work.  i've been placed on probation for calling in too many times in the past month.  i am furious.  i live with my grandparents and am therefore the first resource.  i have to stay home at times to get things ready or make calls for them.  work listens and tells me i'm on probation anyway.  i don't really care - i hate this place.  as i am driving home my mom calls.  "they're taking him to hospice.  it's on broadway next to the citadel."  "i'm on my way now."  i speed down the 202 - taking a stretch i don't normally.  i pass broadway and call my mom.  "where is it???" i demand.  i am so mean to her.  she's not sure.  i call my aunt and finally find the building.  my gramma pulls up and is followed by the ambulance.  they take out the stretcher and wheel him into the 3rd room.  he's just not the same.  not much response.  he won't eat.  he will barely talk.  the fucking nursing home never bathed him - he must feel awful.  that's what i think.  i can't comprehend that he knows he's dying.  i want them to bathe him.  i want him to eat the banana bread that my cousin made for him.  i watch and then go to sit and wait with my mom.  we're there until very late into the night.  my aunt, uncle, mom and me.  we finally go home to get some rest.  the hospice angels have bathed him and he looks better.  it's saturday, april 12th.  i go to hospice.  my cousins tried.  they couldn't handle it.  it's too much, they're too close.  closer to him than me, really.  my mom, aunt, uncles and i make a run for food in the early evening.  we stop at the house and pick up a cd player and some of his music.  we eat a strange buffet of deviled eggs, chicken, salad, grapes, and who knows what else.  we wait again.  it's 11 and my gramma tells us to go home.  she thinks it will be tomorrow, so we should get some sleep and plan to spend the day.  my uncle has already left.  my aunt and her husband leave.  my mom wants to stay awhile longer.  she has the newsletter for church.  she has to finish sorting it for bulk mail.  i tell her i'll stay and help.  then my grandma is outside his door.  i am up getting a drink so i see her panic first.  she tells me "he's not breathing."  i shout quietly to my mom.  i go into the room.  he's gone.  his mouth is gaping.  he's definitely not here anymore.  i grab his hand.  my grandma looks at me and i grab her and hold her.  i am holding her while she cries and still holding his warm hand.  too soon, i drop his hand and hug her with both arms.  i call my aunt and tell her "he's not breathing."  she turns around and is back in 10 minutes.  my uncles and some cousins come.  they just want to see him now, without pain.  they stay for a minute and then go.  i am mad, but i am trying to call my other cousins outside.  i don't know what to feel.  relief and sadness overwhelm me.  is this how i should feel?  our pastor comes.  she helps us.  we all gather in his room and she prays.  i try to close his mouth, but i can't.  then she says "it looks like he's saying 'Wow!'"  i didn't think of that.  thank you, pastor candace.  my grandma loses it and screams "why?  why?  don't leave me!"  pastor candace closes the door and we go outside again and wait.    i want to wait here.  i want to see them pick him up.  i want to hold him some more.  but i go home.    i just want him to know that i love him.  i want to hear that he loves me, that whatever i did or said toward the end was stupid.  that i miss him.  i want his smell, to hear the organ, the classical music.  the monks chanting as he turns on the computer to play solitaire while he does his breathing treatments.  can i just have one more hug?  "...we yearn for a Creation without death or pain...and I think this is exactly what God intended for us to feel..."  yes yes, please God.  give me a life without pain.  give me hope for life without death.  and give me a hug from my papa.  <>

						   i love a rainy night...don't you eddie rabbit?  the storm rolled in behind a huge cloud of dust that we often see in the middle of monsoon season.  it's all coming about 4 months too early, but boy do i love a storm.  i took pictures with my cell phone and sent them to my friend in texas.  she said she doesn't like when i send her pictures when i'm driving, but i promised her these were taken while i was stopped.    as soon as the morning show on 103.9 is over, i'm putting on a cure cd - there's not much better than a rainy day listening to the cure.  if i were at the cabin on the porch that would be my picture of heaven.  thank You for the rain, and for talented musicians.  and for cinnamon life cereal.  <>

						   yesterday while driving home my car pool "buddy" actually left it on 103.9, rather than switching to 93.3.  ( i know i'm a huge jerk and very selfish - she should be able to listen to her music in her car, but 93.3???  come on!!!  van halen and acdc are some of my least favorites, and don't even get me started on rush...)  anyway, we were almost back to her house where i could pick up my car when ocean avenue by yellowcard came on.  this is one of the best songs on the radio right now.  i stared in disbelief as she changed the station halfway through the song.  sure, she'll leave it on during incubus or nickleback (*shudder*) but turns OFF yellowcard...  madness.  <>

						    chaos - still small voice   give the kids all a different paragraph to read while one has a verse.  [paragraphs should be of different categories: entertainment, sports, school, music lyrics, parents, work, etc]  tell all except the verse reader to shout their paragraph as loud as they can, while the verse reader quietly reads.  ask how many heard the verse.  then have all lay down and be QUIET.  have the verse reader quietly read the verse again, in the same voice as before.    1 Kings 19:11-13:  And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; [but] the LORD [was] not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; [but] the LORD [was] not in the earthquake:      1Ki 19:12 And after the earthquake a fire; [but] the LORD [was] not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.      1Ki 19:13 And it was [so], when Elijah heard [it], that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, [there came] a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?    DEAR LORD AND FATHER OF MANKIND by John Greenleaf Whittier Dear Lord and Father of mankind, Forgive our foolish ways; Reclothe us in our rightful mind, In purer lives Thy service find, In deeper reverence, praise.  In simple trust like theirs who heard, Beside the Syrian sea, The gracious calling of the Lord, Let us, like them, without a word, Rise up and follow Thee.  O Sabbath rest by Galilee, O calm of hills above, Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee The silence of eternity, Interpreted by love!  With that deep hush subduing all Our words and works that drown The tender whisper of Thy call, As noiseless let Thy blessing fall As fell Thy manna down.  Drop Thy still dews of quietness, Till all our strivings cease; Take from our souls the strain and stress, And let our ordered lives confess The beauty of Thy peace.  Breathe through the heats of our desire Thy coolness and Thy balm; Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire; Speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire, O still, small voice of calm.   USHER ME DOWN by Jennifer Knapp alone alone is where i'll be  waiting waiting so patiently  escape this little war raging  one Still Small Voice  come rescue me   why wait why wait  why wait for You to Usher Me Down  many o many o Lord my God  the wonders that i have found  when You usher me down   sacrifice and offering  You do not desire of me  i say here i am You come  as if i ever had to call   why wait why wait  why wait for You to Usher Me Down  many o, many o, Lord, my God  the wonders that i have found  when You usher me down   who could replace You?  none i know of  the Throne is Yours alone  left to stand unshaken  can't be taken back  can't be taken back   why wait, why wait  why wait for You to Usher Me Down  many o, many o, Lord, my God  the wonders that i have found  when You usher me down    Psalm 46:10:  Be still, and know that I [am] God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.   PEACE by Rebecca St. James Alone in the valley I cry for You To fill me with Your peace So when the lightning strikes Thunder roars around me Still I live in peace You ask that I  Be still and know You are God Be still and know You are God  When the fires rage When the storms surround me Still I live in peace Though the mountains fall Crash into the ocean Still I live in peace You ask that I  Be still and know You are God Be still and know You are God Be still and know You are God Be still and know You are God  Lead me through the valley Lead me by the streams Restore me and draw me to You, God To You I lift my soul To You who makes me whole Gently You hold me close to You Close to You  Be still and know You are God Be still and know You are God Be still and know You are God Be still and know You are God  You're near me You love me  You hold me You reach me You still me You move me You draw me to You, God  (Repeat)  You are God!

						   finally a diagnosis that makes sense.  after 7 years of "sinus infection - here's a decongestant and antibiotic" i went to a real doctor.  her diagnosis:  allergies and asthma.  makes sense since i can't breathe hardly ever and have to freaking yawn to get a deep breath...and even that doesn't work sometimes.  so now i'm taking 4 different medicines (thank You, Lord for free samples): a nasal spray (yuk), advair (powdery inhaler - very disturbing), atrovent (NASTY tasting inhaler - i make a face each time), and singulair (allergy pill).  and a follow-up appointment in 3 weeks.  a FOLLOW-UP appointment???  i don't think my other dr (physician's assistant) ever heard of follow-ups.  i hope this works.  because i'm sick of being sick.  <>
