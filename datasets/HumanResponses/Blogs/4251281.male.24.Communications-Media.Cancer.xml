      this is why i hate phones.  if i were amish, this wouldn't happen. i would just walk across the village to see her. or a horse-drawn carriage.  but i met one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen in person friday night. of course, she was a waitress. and i was like the fly and she was like fly paper. i know i said words to her. i hoped they were strewn together into complete sentences, complete thoughts, etc. i gave her my phone number in a state of complete spontaniety just because i didn't want to hear her answer if i was to ask hers.  she called the next night. at 11:57 p.m. wanting to hang out. where was I? at a bar. with my phone not on vibrate.  i wanted to punch myself in the face.

      i was talking to a female friend's "boyfriend" at a concert last night.  he started talking about how tough he was in high school, college and now. he was flexing mc flexing, talking about carbs, diets and carb diets and i kinda nodded off.  then he dropped the phrase "going to have to kick ass and take names."  i said, "it's much more hard-core to kick the ass and make someone else take the names."  from the look on his face, i think his brain must have shorted.

         top 10 reasons why flying makes me tres uncomfortable  10. i saw final destination. now anytime i fly planes, take showers, walk near buses or railroads or see devon sawa on the street, i scream. like a silent high-pitched scream that warns small squirrels and deer.  9. i always get sat right next to the looney tunes. i can't make last night's adventure up. i sat next to a nearly 5 foot latino woman who was holding a 4 foot tall pink plush bunny when i sat down. luckily, no one sat down between us and she gave him his own seat and belt buckle. i swear the bunny was laughing at me.  8. i am 6 foot, 5 inches tall. yep.  7. my last girlfriend was intent on joining the mile-high club. it was the single most terrifying and simultaneously the single most hilarious thing i have ever attempted. it kinda reminded me of that scene from "indiana jones and the temple of doom" in which indiana and short round are in that bug-filled trap and the spikes are coming down and it's really intense and the heroine is screaming...but with sex.  6. last night, i realized i need an IPOD stat. trying to find suitable tunes on the airplane radio station, i stumbled on some sort of alternate-90's, we-really-don't-care-where-they-are-know radiostation. i heard kriss kross's "jump," sir mix-a-lot's "baby got back," tag team's "whomp there it is" and right said fred's "i'm too sexy." back to freakin back. i was horrified but i COULD NOT change the channel.  5. a couple years ago, they stopped serving meals. not that big a loss. but last year, they stopped serving peanuts. they instead started serving salty pretzels. luckily, they downgraded yet again. last night, they gave me some water and a salt packet. i felt like such a supermodel.  4. my one time ever flying first class was tinged with sadness. after a long set of events, i was laid over in LAX for seven extra hours. american airlines gave me an upgrade and a $10 certificate to McDonald's. have you ever tried to spend $10 at McDonald's. it's virtually IMPOSSIBLE. i told the girl my order and I had only $3 spent. i didn't want to waste it. i was ordering things i'd never heard of, giving away apple turnovers and chocolate chip cookies to little kids, etc. i felt like willy wonka in a way that i was making all the kids in LAX happy with sugary joy. but once i got onto the plane, i instantly passed out from sugar, slept the whole way and missed out on all the first-class trimmings.   3. i get really bored really fast. and since i am constantly in varying degrees of uncomfortability (maybe a word?), i have to amuse myself somehow. it usually involves drinking. last year, i got a bunch of southwest (ugh!) drink coupons for my xmas flight home. bunch=15 or so drinks. after drinking 4 in the first hour and a half, i started buying my entire row drinks. guess who was the man with the master plan on that particular flight??  2. (I blanked out for a second and forgot this entire number)  1. two words. some syllables. baggage claim.
