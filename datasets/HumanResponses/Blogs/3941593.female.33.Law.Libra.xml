      &nbsp; I admit, I like Martha Stewart. There, I said it, ok, I like her. Why you ask?&nbsp;Easy, I see a lot&nbsp;of myself in her. I've read the biographies of her life, I've watch the made for TV movies. I know about as much about Martha as Martha knows about Martha. I know, I need a life, but that's yet another post.  &nbsp; Everyday for years, I would set my VCR for the Martha Stewart Living show. I was a religious watcher as some are to their soaps. I've watched her make decedent desserts with ease and prescision. I've watched her plant and harvest garden upon garden taking the fruits of her labor and make yet another wonderful concoction. I've watched her celebrate her mother, her friends and family in the simplest and most elaborate ways. I've watched her celebrate the seasons and wonder if this would be the year that I try some of her ideas. Hell, I watched her with the Muppets for god's sake! I find the woman intriguing. I love her style, I love her elegance. Her knowledge is endless. I wished I had half of Martha's class in my left pinky. Martha is peddling what I want. I think she peddles what a lot of Americans want, and THAT is what makes Martha so successful.  &nbsp; Being Martha has led to her downfall. Do I think she lied to federal investigators, YEP. Do I think she's a cold woman who comes across bitchy, YEP.&nbsp; Both of those faults will be or are her undoing. People don't dislike Martha, in fact, I think a lot of people are impressed with her drive and business acumen. People dislike Martha because she isn't warm and fuzzy. She could certainly bow to advise and change her approach but then Martha wouldn't be true to who she is. I'M not a warm and fuzzy person to the average bistander. It takes me quite some time to get to know a person and hence, trust them with my friendship. I believe Martha is like that also. Driven, with her eyes squarely on the prize and maybe stepping over people in return. I've read article after article about her. I've chalked up scathing remarks to not knowing the woman and only making assumptions about her. I watched an interview tonight on 20/20 with Barbara Walters. The woman is just cold! After her 2.5 year ordeal you would think the label of convicted felon and a prison sentence would soften the steely reserve. NOPE, Martha is Martha. Onward, upward and I'll be back. Like Arnold Schwartzenegger with a pastry brush.  &nbsp; Folks can't understand her need for perfection. If you weren't raised by a perfectionist, you won't understand and I don't dare try and explain it all in this&nbsp;post.&nbsp;Perfectionism is who you are, it is what you are and it will forever remain. You expect nothing less than perfection&nbsp;from everyone around you. Inevidibly, you will alienate people. Folks also don't understand how a woman worth billions would do anything the least bit shady for a paultry $12,000. Martha didn't grow up rich. Everything Martha has is because Martha made it. She made it with her mind, her hands and the help of wise business and financial advisors. She's frugal, she learned to be growing up in a house of 8 individuals. Her parents instilled this fugality in her. She doesn't buy the best or insist on the best because she can afford it. She buys it or uses it because 1.) she's a perfectionist, nothing less will do and 2.) in the long run of frugality, it will last her the longest and be most cost efficient.&nbsp;Simple math, nothing more. I would bet that $12,000 to Martha Stewart today is STILL a lot of money even though on paper she's a billionaire. With that said, I'm sure she lied, who wants to loose that kind of money, especially a frugal perfectionist billionaire. A buck is a buck to Martha. I'm no billionaire heck, I'm no millionaire, I'm an ordinary average worker but I am very mindful of my spending. I still pick up pennies when I see them and I feel a great sense of accomplishment when I look at my savings account or retirement plan. I balk at wastefulness. I'm no packrat by any means. Hoarding actually annoys me. Here's a glimpse into how my brain works. I still can't understand why Americans buy prepackaged pudding cups when you can make an entire bowl for a quarter of the price as the prepackaged stuff. I don't get it.  &nbsp; I do love to cook, bake, keep my home and do crafts. Martha's endless knowlege on all subjects facinates me. I'm a learner too, I prefer to watch PBS over regular TV.&nbsp; Martha once commented on loving to iron. There's a sense of accomplishement when you see a pile of once wrinkled laundry items all neatly hanging in a closet starched and pressed. I can soooooooo relate to that feeling and my friends think I'm nuts for loving to iron.  &nbsp; I know Martha is a love/hate entity. I have a love/hate relationship with her myself some days. I love her business sense, I love how she has a thirst for knowlege. I love that she has shared her ideas with us for&nbsp;years. I don't like the way she treated people, I don't like the way she's been treated and I really don't like her report with children on her show. I do however like what Martha is peddling and I wish I had more energy to be more Martha.

       I was introduced to blogs by an internet acquaintance. I never thought myself much of a writer. I've never kept journals. Generally, I archive my random thoughts in my head, never having had&nbsp;a desire to actually put them down on paper or hurl them out into cyber space for others to muse over. Ok, this is weird to me. Very weird. For the most part I'm a private person, we'll see how long I last. I suppose everyone blogs for different reasons. Some are potential writers, damn good writers with natural talent, I might add. Some see a blog as an extension of their own personal journal writing. Some see it&nbsp;AS their journal. I'm not exactly sure why I'm doing this. I suppose my reasons are two fold. Partly to improve my writing skills, partly to leave a lasting legacy. Yeah, like my ancestors are really going to give a crap about my ramblings. Oh well, I'm at least throwing it out there. Please be kind, I'm a blog virgin.
