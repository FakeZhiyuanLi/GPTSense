      things i learned this week and some quotable quotes...   - no commitment vs. commitment : no commitment. less hassle, no complications, no strings attached. no broken heart.  - easy access vs. all access : easy access. how easy access?  "enough to frustrate me a few minutes. easy enough to rip off when I can't stand it anymore."  - "one (wo)man's trash is another (wo)man's treasure" : 'nuff said.

      I had a blast last night at peligro's.   Had a cold San Mig Light in my hand, a new band to listen to, and saw my super-dooper-love good friend Lou. she really made my day by meeting up with me and cheering me thru the past few days.  while we only got to spend a few minutes together, she managed to pick up some unspoken messages that were being sent out. so receptive, she had, inadvertently, put me on the spot.  either that or my face is really like a billboard.  anyhow, i just want to say that Greenbelt is  so  different when experienced with someone else. That's all I can say.

      i didn't used to like surprises. but i had a *nice* surprise just now.  thanks for thinking i'm a keeper  (and that i'm   hot  ) , little girl. people think i am, but the one i want to think of me as that, doesn't. she keeps throwing me away.  i know she'll say she never did, that in fact,   i   threw us away. that i didn't take care of what we had. but i never lost interest in her. she always lost interest first. she always saw something wrong with us.  you were right. they aren't over each other.    so f*** 'em.      &nbsp;   magsama kayo! leave me out your f***ing messy, selfish, self-righteous lives.       &nbsp;   no more drama. enough.       &nbsp;   throw away whatever we've had. i've had enough of your lies and your promises and your reasons. i loved you honestly and truly. unconditionally. but you wouldn't know what that means.       &nbsp;   all you wanted was your fairy tale. well what do you know! fairy tales always have evil witches and the characters never had happy endings. prince charming cheated on the princess and the princess ended up being fat, ugly and miserable.       &nbsp;   one day i will have the strength to erase you from my life. for now responsibilities call. and i AM still in love with you. foolish little old me.       &nbsp;   one day i will look back at the 6 years with you and say "those were nothing."       &nbsp;   ---    want more  shockers ? want more of my  top ten list ??? ( i have more!!!)&nbsp; will post later today. watch out for it my little   chismosa friends  ! ;-)

      Lesson Learned:  Never go out with someone who fell in love with you so fast and so hard.  Chances are they are just being impulsive.  Chances are they will fall out of love for you the moment they see and get to know the REAL you.  The moment you become like me, cranky, tantrum-y and brutally honest and comfortable, they will RUN like mad.  Beware.  Lesson Learned:  There are people who still think that love is easy. Love is easy. Relationships are not. Commitment is harder.    Trust me.

      today no tears were shed.   i'm still at work, trying to figure out what else needs to be done. all work is done, just waiting for boss to get better and make decisions for layouts, etc.   had a fun day at work, actually. not that much to do so i was able to concentrate on my layout work and breathe in between pages. heck, even got to check downelink and blog. :)   i'm still thinking whether i should go to that exclusive this friday or not though...   maybe not.   i think that i should take my  "going straight"  campaign more seriously.   backtrack...   ---  spoke to my friend niquee who's getting married this october. asked her if she was happy with her life. she said, "it's okay. lesser evil." for some reason, i knew exactly what she meant. hers was not a fairy tale sort like our other friend mita's. [mita doesn't work, stays at home, pregnant and savoring 7 months of newly-wedded bliss with her husband who showers her with presents, shopping and all that  adoring  attention.]   but i know niquee's as happy as she can get -- for now. and she isn't complaining.   she's thankful she has her   mucho guapito   son Liam (my  inaanak ). she says she doesn't ask for much; just a simple pat on the back from her husband-to-be, a smack and a little holding hands. she doesn't ask for flowers or a date or even heart-stopping, sizzling sex. but she's happy and glad she has Liam and her guy.   that's when it occurred to me that maybe, just maybe, i was hoping for too much with Lia. that i was probably meant to go straight, that what i had with her was just my little chance at happiness and bliss. that i was meant to end up with kids, a husband i don't feel passionately crazy about and a cute little house somewhere.     *my heart just skipped a beat. wonder what that meant?*     Che was probably right. Maybe Lia and I weren't meant to be with each other after all.   ---   spoke to Becky and Therese yesterday. They both agreed that relationships are not easy. that maybe she just needs space.   even my tita said that we will get back together  pa .   i don't know. i'm tired. this time all i have is love and i know for sure it isn't enough. never enough. not with lia.     napapagod din ang puso.     ---   so i'm  "going straight."    and while i am looking forward to seeing   someone   soon, i know it won't be anything much.    i never did register well with guys.

      I've been having a really sucky day.  And I thought I had it all worked out until tonight.&nbsp; I was gonna be fine, I thought.&nbsp; What was another breakup with her anyway?  Then you send me a YM.&nbsp; You asked me what would be a good first year annive gift.&nbsp; Now, of all days you ask me that.  So I answer you best as I can that now is not a good time.&nbsp; That you give her whatever she's been wanting. [I thought, I wouldn't be much help anyway,&nbsp;I don't know her that well.]&nbsp;  Then you call me a bitch.  All day I felt like hanging myself from the ceiling and I had to use every single energy I had to stay afloat.  You, of all people, who knew how it felt to be in my place.  I am genuinely happy for you.&nbsp;No one else can be happier for you than me.&nbsp; You have no right to be this cruel to me just because you found someone to love you and adore you.  I would never drag you into my hangups.&nbsp; I never even told you what was happening to me even though I thought you would be able to knock sense into me.&nbsp; But I guess I'm wrong.&nbsp; You don't deal well with other people's hangups anyway.  And yes, I know I brought all these upon myself.&nbsp; I'm not blaming you or anyone.  I never bad-mouthed that ex of yours who broke your heart.&nbsp; I prayed to God to give you strength when you would text me how miserable you were, 'cause God knows I don't have any to give you.&nbsp; I was going thru deep shit with you.  Just because you're happy and I'm not doesn't mean I bitched on you.&nbsp; You're the last person I want to be a bitch to.   If you only knew.   I'm glad you showed me your true colors.&nbsp; I just didn't think other people's impression of you would be affirmed to me this way.

       on a lighter note...      i'm looking forward to working with paolo dy again. it was real fun doing the CEU and Ayala video so I'm hoping&nbsp;for fun days ahead. hopefully he'll teach me some graphics and editing tricks again. enough with the  "magic"  explanation. ;-)    i've had enough "magic" shit for now.    things are picking up, i think.   to those who texted me yesterday, i'm okay, for now.   to B, Mari, Tinggot, Ate Nikki, Che, Nina, Bong, and yes, even Ruey (who texted an unrelated text but at least replied to my question and distracted me briefly from my mad and crazy hell), thanks -- I made it thru yesterday.   to Therese and Becky and the UBE MEDIA Gang, you guys are blessings to me. Thanks for making me smile today. : )   to my sweetest baby sister, Melo, who, all the way from Singapore, texted me and sent me an SMS hug to get thru today. i still wish i were with u and ate there.  i love you .   oops, one last, special mention to paolo, who unknowingly, made my day. : ) and for that, i will continue my search for a cute chinita and petite editor who can digitize and edit with you all night long. ;-)

        The magic that is in a relationship is not at the moment of meeting the loved one. The magic is what holds the couple together for years after the meeting.         I lost her, finally. Maybe for both our own good.     I have exhaled.       Why then does it hurt so much?

      Yesterday I lost my mind.     I woke up with a text from her saying that my texts were so sweet. I shrug it off.   An hour later I text her saying we should just be friends. I was okay. I knew in my heart we needed the time off, trusted that she loved me and certain that I love her. Hopeful that in a few days, weeks, months, we'll be okay and back in each other's arms.   I text her saying she's still my bestfriend.   So I ask her if she wants to be study buddies with me. She texts back that she made plans that afternoon already. I&nbsp;went   ballistic  .   I have never felt this jealous before. Never. (And to think my ex would make me jealous and cheat on me on purpose.) I felt like I was going crazy, like the whole world was going to swallow me up. I'm so scared I texted everyone to help me get through the day.   B, the infamous ex, and some friends helped me get through the day somehow. Somehow.   I text B:   "I'm jealous. Have you ever felt that? The kind where you think you're getting a heart attack. Where you feel your whole heart stops, you can't breathe and your head spins. That's how I feel."   Or something to that effect.   Anyway, to keep the story short, I have gone mad.    I still am.    Here I am sending her crazy SMS messages when I know that I should just leave her alone. That maybe we are better off apart. That we are NEVER going to work out.   Love has never been this complicated for me.   I have grown into a selfish, jealous person, bitter and unhappy.  Yes Lia, I know I did this all myself.      But all I asked of you was to love me, be with me and help me become a better person. To be honest with me and to fix whatever needed to be fixed. All those other things you accused me of, that I only grew to love you, that I only settled with you, that I only tried to change when things got really bad, I accept it even if it's not true.   Maybe if you had only believed me then maybe you wouldn't be this dissatisfied.   We have succumbed to our insecurities. And we have given up on what we thought was love.    B texted me this:    "Have you tried talking to lia about it? Here's the thing: Lia and You are blessed tobe together. Not all people have what both of you have and we envy you (yes, we d freakin closet romantics). I don't claim to be an expert on this but here's what I know: it's good that both of u trust each other. Hold on to that. That'll hold your relationship together, with friendship and love of course."       Yes Lia, not many people have what we have. I know you don't see this now but I know we had it the moment we kissed. Heck, even the moment our eyes locked at the chapel. I knew in my heart that you are The One.   I prayed for you months before God sent you to me. I asked Him to send me The One through a meeting in the chapel. I have had that chapel as my secret refuge and I knew that the chances of my meeting The One there was unlikely.   But I did meet you there. At the last pew, you sat beside me. When I had specifically said to meet OUTSIDE the chapel.   Outside the chapel I saw you. A few feet away I saw you, with your spikey hair and tan, leaning against the wall. Then you looked up, our eyes locked and I felt a tug in my heart.   It scared me, to be honest. I wasn't expecting anything like that so early in my life. I had just turned 18 and gotten out of a 3-year 11 month relationship. I wanted to have fun, to date around and take things easy.   I couldn't look you in the eye after that. But you had me then.   I surprised myself by taking a walk under the sun with you, something I never would've done before. So many things happened after, coincidences, signs, whatever.   Then I said "I love you." I'm sure you wouldn't remember when and how it happened, but for me, the feeling and the memory burned itself into my mind and my soul. It's still so vivid it feels like yesterday. May 14, 1998, around 4 am, my whole life changed.   I've never been the same after that day, Lia.        I'm sorry I screwed us up.

      Yesterday felt like we were a couple again -- at least for some moments.  I love spending time with her; it's never a dull, boring moment with her. Traffic is somewhat my bestfriend when I'm with her. But then again, when difficult subjects arise, it's a different story.  Anyway...  I had a really weird dream this morning.  I was supposed to still have my braces on but then it  was kinda loose so when I tugged on it, some of the brackets came off.  Here's the weird part... When I tugged on it, some of my teeth came off while some brackets tore off a part of some teeth.  Parang I had a chip on my tooth. I was so disturbed by it that I couldn't open my mouth daw and when I did, it was only to stare at my teeth.  I told my dad about this and he said that my dream might have bad messages with it (that someone I know will die). Of course I push the thoughts aside -- it's too early to be morbid.  I guess it was only because we went to a wake last night. Or maybe I'm thinking of the wrong interpretation. Whatever.  ---  Is she or isn't she?  Still in love with B, that is.  Or B still in love with G. Whatever.    It was kinda awkward to see her in a setting different from the usual meetings.  In a social setting, seeing her caused my stomach to do flip-flops and for me to start getting weird paranoid thoughts. (Is G still in love with her?  Is B still not over my G? Are they wishing they were together? What do their friends think? What is G thinking while B is telling a story?  What is G thinking while B retells her story about missing a turn and her studying etc etc? Does G wish I was more like B? Is it really over between them?)  It's so complicated, our situation.  I had her first but she left me for her. She went  back to me after a year and a few months. Then she left me again for her. Then they broke up and she went back to me. Then we broke up and they got together again.  It didn't work out between them now she's with me again.  I have her but she's not happy.  How can I not live with so much baggage when the situation is like this?  She doesn't really understand where I'm coming from, I think.  And I am trying to understand where she's coming from. But for the life of me, we're not seeing eye to eye.  Oh well. At least we're having some fun.  Forget that the kind of fun we're having is oh-so-wholesome. Fun is fun.  ---  But then again, what do I say or think when she asks me what do I do if we never get intimate again?

      waiting to exhale...   cleaned up my phone last saturday night while she slept thru a bad tummy ache. downloaded all her photos, messages and what-nots in my phone and kept it (hopefully) safe in my laptop. i saw an old message from my blissfully happy friend jec which read "think about it cei, you've waited for this for a long time. now exhale."  i'm still waiting jec.  i feel this breath, this one big sigh that will tell me that it is, finally, over.  but for now i hold my breath.  i cannot take care of her. and i cannot make her happy. at least not the way she wants to be happy.  she was just in love with the idea of me. not the me that is flawed and imperfect and ridiculously crazy in love with her. she cannot see that part of me that is deliriously happy with her. that part that sings when i'm driving (thru traffic and back), the part that blurts out "i love lia!" out of the blue, making my sister roll her eyes and say "ano ba yan!" and laugh at how mushy i've gotten.  she doesn't see that part that smiles dreamily before going to bed and wakes up happy thinking of her.  she doesn't see that part that talks about her constantly to her friends, that part that unconsciously mentions her or anything about her in the middel of conversations  with acquiantances, friends, and yes, even strangers. she doesn't know about that part of me that beams when i see her coaching or simply talking about softball. she doesn't know about that part that is forever grateful for coaxing me out of my shell and giving me the courage to face the sun and revel in life.  she doesn't know many things.  and maybe it was my fault. i didn't communicate with her the way she wanted to me to communicate with her. i suck at being a communicator. oh shit, i'm in the wrong career then.  oh well.  i watched her sleep last saturday night, like so many nights in the past. always adoring her, always caressing her face, her hair, arm lovingly, always wondering why she cannot see how much i love her, or that i love her in my own unique, if not, unusual way.  i berated myself for causing her tummyache. for again taking her word that she was okay, that she can wait until dinnertime to eat (despite the fact that she didn't have lunch.) i trust her word, that's why. when she says she's okay, i believe she's okay. but then again, when she says she loves me, i doubt.  but that's another story altogether.  she said she worried i was driving home late. of course i believe her again. but then i wonder, is this concern a special one for me? or is it a generic concern that she would've felt for any other friend of hers?  that's the trouble with loving someone who's so genuinely nice to everyone. you never know when you're getting the special attention and treatment.  but saturday was two days ago. today is monday and i am waiting to exhale. again.  she asked me why i never blog when i am happy. it's not that i don't. i just am too caught up in the daily events of my happy life that i don't find the time to blog. but when i'm unhappy, it's usually because she's not around. hence, more time alone, more time to waste and more time to be idle. mag-blog na lang, di ba?  besides, people are generally sick of me asking them what to do to make us work.  and i honestly think they have run out of advice for me and her. so i'm left with no one to talk to but a blank screen and the whole web space to shout out to for enlightenment or maybe simply to sigh out my sadness and frustrations.  SHE IS STILL THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.  and though right now i know the future is bleak for us, i am certain of how i feel about her.  but i have to move on.  yesterday i went to the grocery. saw several women with their kids and i couldn't help but feel envy. envy that the kind of life we had planned together will most likely not happen. then i figured maybe i should go straight na lang. maybe that is my destiny. whatever power and reason brought me to her and her to me, i do not know. nor am i too eager to find out why. but for now, i am considering opening my doors to the straight life. not for love but for a quiet, perhaps more boring, life. maybe i should have kid/s, a husband whom i do not feel passionately for but at least respect. or maybe no husband. just me and my kid/s. no more traveling to foreign places, being silly and adventurous. no more laughing out loud, animated discussions about anything and everything, and passionate, hot and always a scream (excuse the pun) making love sessions. oh well.  i thought i was the luckiest person in the world when we found each other.  i can hear her asking, "then why didn't you take care of us?"

      We fought again. It's that f***ing cursed CRV. We were so okay the past few days. And now this. We were in a worse place than we ever were.  All I wanted to hear was that she loves me. That she loves me and that she loves me enough that she doesn't want to be selfish this time.  But of course she doesn't.  Again the rooftop of the condo looks so appealing.  But then again, vanity of vanities. I don't want to be a mere tangle of crushed bone and blood on a dirt parking lot.  Besides, if I die and they end up together, I would only have a miserable dead existence (if there is such a thing) while if I live I can take a chance at some semblance of happiness with some half-baked version of her.  I thought we had something magical.  I screwed it big time.     And she only agrees with me.

      Ten Reasons Why G Should Go Out With B...  10. They're both vegetarians now.  Whenever we eat out, I always have to find a place where she can pick out something to eat that isn't beef or pork.  While I never did mind this, I sometimes feel a little sad that we can no longer share pork or beef dishes like we used to.  No more gyoza, barbecue or sisg for us... 9. They both say "Galingan Mo."  Weird and petty as it may sound, but when I saw B text me that one morning, I literally freaked out. I always thought that that was a unique, personal, and sweet greeting from G to me.  Oh well. 8. They both adore RENT and live by the saying, "No Day But Today."  While I have nothing against the play (I actually think that we, G and I, were Joanne and Maureen), their adoration for the play is something quite unnerving.  I know G as a passionate person.  But learning that there's someone else as passionate about that play as G...  Anyway, they both live by "No Day But Today" and that's what worries me.  While I try to live by that rule (though I would never say it to G's face), I also do think about how other people would feel if and when I decide to "carpe diem."  I don't just jump into a decision not thinking of its consequences.  They "carpe diem" whenever they feel like it and unfortunately, I have been caught in their "no day but today" moments. 7. Because they both love coffee. 6. G wanted to be a doctor and B IS a doctor. 5. Because B still talks about G. 4. Dahil nagpasulot ang sinusulot sa nanunulot. 3. Because G doesn't like angry people. And B doesn't get angry.  Unfortunately, I have anger management issues. 2. So they can stop making a fool of me. 1. So I can have MY peace of mind that the one I love will not be taken away from me -- ever.

      ONE BIG FIGHT!!!  Thought I wouldd be stuck watching the basketball game at the condo with a bunch of oldies who will neither appreciate nor understand my noisy cheering.  Thankfully, Robby couldn't make it to the game and had to give up his Upperbox A ticket. My sister and I rushed to the Noth Avenue MRT Station to get the ticket and brave the crowd in Araneta.  We got to Araneta just in time for the game.  We found ourselves seated in an area with a good view of the court but with one glitch. We were stuck with a bunch of annoying-porma-girls-who-seem-to-be-as-clueless-as-a-board about basketball.  I have always been annoyed at girls who wore too much makeup and wore ridiculous gimmick-like attire for basketball games.  No, actually, I am more amused than annoyed.  Imagine having to cheer in your little stilletos and/or kitten heeled shoes while waving your arms around and screaming insults at the opposing team.  So unladylike!  Anyhow, this girl proved to be such a source of amusement (if not sheer annoyance and much controlled temper) for me, Melodie and Trisha.  Annoying-girl-with-a-lot-of-makeup confused us so much as to which team she was on; she would scoff and sniff her nose at the Ateneo team during the plays but then again, she would clap and cheer when the Ateneo cheers were being chanted.  I saw Trisha giving the girl dagger looks a few minutes into the game that my own annoyance mounted; i readied the sticky little lollipop stick I had and kept it in my pocket for future use.  Annoying-girl-with-a-lot-of-makeup would've gone home with a sticky cherry lollipop stick stuck in her hair (or lower back, where her tight little yellow tank top ends and tight little pants begin).   Pasalamat siya Ateneo won so she had no reason to be smug  and all and we were not cranky enough to pull off our (or at least my) devious little plan.  Ok lang, at least I didn't get to do my evil deed for the day.  Anyway, went back to the condo in high spirits and didn't mind the crowd at the MRT Station.  We were actually quite proud 'cause we already had bought the MRT tickets before we went to the game.  The MRT ticket line was horrible; and to have to brave that crowd of not-so-happy La Sallites -- no way. Harhar!  And so the Blue Eagles have made my day. Harhar!!!  Other addtional stories to follow tomorrow... ;-)

       For Lia...  k.d. lang's Love Affair   skies without stars  all the nights without you  I watch the world  from a room without a view  for you left me  with so few memories  I could close my eyes  and cling to  just a fading photograph  I'd sometimes sink to    all those smiles unexplored  all the words left unsaid  we strung our dreams  on and all to slender thread  for you left me  with so few memories  I could close my eyes  and cling to   just a half-remembered tune  I'd sometimes sing to    now I found what we lost  time was all all it cost  love's always there  knowing someday I would share  in a life-long love affair with you    love was always there  knowing someday I would share  in a life-long love affair with you  in a life-long love affair with you

      alone  she went to my office today. she asked if i can go with her to the bathroom. i oblige knowing that we can talk privately there. before we even get there she tells me, "i asked you to go with me to the bathroom so i can ask for a hug from you." my heart melts. i tell her that i did want to give her a hug too.  inside i wrap my arms around her, tightly, never wanting to let go. i just knew then that i never want to be with anyone else but her. that if i can take back everything i said the past few weeks, i would. my life would never be complete without her.  i cry in her arms and i feel that she really does love me. that all my stubborness is just that, stubborness and nothing else but.  i have never felt more safe anywhere than in her arms.  in her arms, i am home.  after some talk, i tell her that i don't mind that she wants to be alone. i love her. she's in me and she's a part of my life. her being alone does not mean i have to stop loving her.  if we get through this, i really hope to God that I have learned my lessons. I never want to hurt her or make her cry or make her feel bad about anything.  More importantly, I don't want her ever to think that she isn't loved.  i am, for now, keeping my distance. but i will never let her go and i will always be here if she needs me.

      so am i blessed to still have her around despite everything that has happened to us?  Yes I am.  Today I woke up felt her beside me.  Of course she isn't there but for the longest time, I havent felt her near me.  I have always woken up feeling her presence so close to me despite the fact that we are really in two different places.  I watched her nap last night.  I love watching her while she sleeps.  She sleeps so peacefully, like a baby, making me feel like I want to protect her with all my might and to make sure she is safe always.  I hold her hand in the car, feeling its smooth skin and gentle fingers that curl into mine. I feel a surge of emotions when I look at her -- an unusual mix of affection and tenderness, as well as a strong attraction, both physical and sexual.  I love her.  With all my heart.  She brought me food.  This sweet, sweet girl I failed and disappointed the other day. She thought of me and still brought me food despite her tampo.  I don't know how to make it up to her or if I even should.   I don't deserve her, I think.  She's too much of an angel for me.  But I love her.  And I want to make her happy.  And I want to take care of her.  For the rest of our lives.

      i'm telling myself "i told you so".  a leopard never changes his spots. and neither does she.  she is the same impulsive, head-spinning, heart-stopping lover/girlfriend/admirer/stalker/partner i've had for the past six years. but then again, for me, she's just the love of my life.  i know i shouldn't have gotten involved with her again, for the nth time, in the first place. in the second place, a nagging feeling has always existed at the pit of my stomach whenever thoughts of her and her ex enter my mind.  basically, i'm a fool.  there's a dull pain in my chest that spreads to my whole being. tears well my eyes every so often that work is not much fun and i struggle to go through the day without climbing the stairs to get to the rooftop of our office building and jumping.  jumping off.  she told me if our relationship was good for both of us, good for me, then i would never dream of hurting myself. but self-inflicted pain brings a certain pleasure, a certain control over other things that cause us so much pain, as if it overpowers that pain which we have no control over.  but i am past that.  or at least i pretend to be.  since the clock struck 5pm, the lump in my throat started growing bigger, the dull ache in my chest spreading to my stomach as if piercing through my soul. i knew being alone would be hell. the nights endless and living excruciating.  i am such a suicidal freak for getting involved with her.  how can one have so much love for someone and be given in return so much pain?  F**K her. she just texted. and she sounded so happy while i type away my misery holding back tears. she texted just to say that i should be proud of myself for a job well-done with the summer book i layout-ed page-per-page. a true labor of love, i must say. for her and her passions.  she wanted to be alone she said. and when i felt that this time, i can walk away, at least a few steps away, i did. but i knew that walking away would give her the space, the time and the chance to get back with her ex -- thus losing her forever.  or maybe it should be giving her up forever.  does love have to be this painful and complex and twisted?  i always thought love was something that happened to people, made them happy, made them sad, but still, always keeping them together. i never saw love with qualifiers and measures such as "is it healthy?" "is it good?" "is it satisfying?" "are you happy?" and all that crap. you just, well, loved.  i need to stop here and lock myself in the office bathroom. i cannot hold back for long. i will cry and i know that when i do, there's no stopping me. i will call her, text her, and beg for her to take me back, that we try again, that we're a good team that simply lost our vision. and i will get pissed. and i will piss her off. and we will argue and bitch and hate each other and make each other all the more miserable.  "When the horse is dead, get off it."  I never liked horses.

      Went to the World Food Expo at the World Trade Center yesterday.  Stayed for about two hours, sampled everything that can be sampled, bought really,really good longganisa and went home sated. :)  Things to check out at the WOFEX:  1. Dips and dressings.  Brand to check out are Connie's Kitchen's Cheese Torta (layers of cheese with pesto and sun-dried tomato), Bravo's Chicken Liver Pate and their tomato dips and pasta sauces, Gourmet's for their Honey Mustard dressing and Sun-dried Tomato dips for salads and sauces and Joyce's for the Quezo de Bola Dip.  2. Mother Earth Longganisa. Aside from the P5 Longganisa on Stick, they sell this longganisa for P60/12 pc pack.  Not bad.  Quite yummy actually.  Lean meat, no pieces of fat or cartillage or tough skin that you bite into.  Perfectly seasoned, not too salty, not too spicy.  Zap it in the microwave to cook the inside and grill or fry with little oil to brown the skin.  Perfect for those cold mornings or late nights where you suddenly feel like eating a good ole Pinoy breakfast.  3. Marinated Bangus. These sell for P90/pack and come in flavored marinades such as Teriyaki, Italian Pesto, Escabeche, Hawaiian Adobo, French Herb Tomato, and Sweet Chili.  Tasted the Escabeche -- yum.  Big plus factor: it's boneless.  4. Gold Leaf Flavored Teas.  Want to switch to tea?  Try these fruit teas by Gold Leaf.  Tried the Strawberry and Lychee -- super yum.  You can make iced teas from them but hot teas are quite good too.  Good end to a heavy meal.  Pwede nang dessert.  Priced well too (P70/20 bag box).  5. Paradise Mango Rum Liquer.  If you're tired of the usual lambanog, vodka or tequila mix (God forbid you're still into that whole gin pomelo thing!), try this mango liquer. Mixed with pineapple orange juice, it's sweet and not too alcohol-y.  With Sprite, the alcohol taste is pretty sharp but not too strong.  Mixed with dry vermouth, and gin -- you'll forget you're in a food expo.  Oh, when you get there, look for the "bartender" named Bien (befriend him and he'll make you any drink you want with the mango rum liquer.) ;)  6. Cua Pao Bacon filling.  I didn't used to eat cua pao until Lia introduced it to me.  A little sweet, a little salty and not fatty at all.  You don't have to make it into a cua pao filling, as is, it's pretty good already.  7. Carrot Calamansi juice.  I forget the brand name (there were several, but the name that comes to mind is Fontana).  Anyway, this juice sounds really healthy, rich in vitamin C and antioxidants.  Try it, tastes like orange juice lang naman.  So far, this is my must-have/want-to's list from the World Food Expo.  Will be going back tomorrow and Saturday to pick up my chosen purchases. ;)   NOTE in going to the WOFEX:  1.) Bring enough cash and eat a light meal before going.  If you go with an empty stomahc, everything will seem to look and/or taste good.  Hard to be discerning when you're famished.  2.) Try everything.  If you buy the first thing that you like, you might miss out on a better item or deal.  3.) Ask if they are available in the supermarkets or groceries and if not, get their contact info so you know where to look for them.  Hope these help!  Enjoy the expo!  Bon appetit!

      i don't know what to do... do i let you go and move on? or do i stick around and wait for you to come back to me?  do i risk another year of my life for us? or do i throw away our dreams and plans and our past and future?    tell me what to do. i need to know.  i cannot wait too long. life is too short and beautiful to be experienced at a stand still.

      i found this from a friend's friend's blog... i don't know if this is wrong but i will quote her anyway... it says so much about how i feel but in a less antagonistic way...   July 31, 2004  And they say I'm mathematically challenged  We are the sum of our relationships.  If you cheated on me, if you lied to me, if you caused me pain, if you broke my heart, you have contributed in making me the monster that I am now.  It doesn't matter how long ago it was. I have you to blame thank blame thank for my calluses, my scars, my hangups, the ugliness in my heart.  There used to be a time when I was a good partner, when I knew how to make things work.  Now I am so flawed I can't even see straight.  You hurt me then, you hurt me now.   Say it proudly, wear it on a badge.  You screwed me over twice.   Nocturnal Angel | 06:33 30.7.04  ---    "There used to be a time when I was a good partner, when I knew how to make things work.  Now I am so flawed I can't even see straight."  i  think this is how i made you feel.  you whom i love so much. i don't know what to say to make things better. all i can say is i'm sorry.

      since when did life get so complicated?  my other gwapo ninong (i have two), was diagnosed with cancer of the tongue, bordering on stage 3. i wonder how my cousins and my tita are coping...  anyway, our planning meeting here at the office went well. it's so invigorating to be in an organization that motivates you and brings out the positive energy in each one. i've always wanted to be a part of something big, something important and the people i work with now have the same goals in mind. i really hope our company will do well.  going back to my usual chatter...  (which i think people are curious about (although they would never admit to being closet chismosas)  i had spent time with The-Love-of-My-Life last Sunday and yesterday when we met up for coffee and study session. i love looking at her and watching her study. she gets so caught up that she doesn't notice i'm staring.  ---  on my way to the office yesterday, i heard songs that reminded me of her. "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" etc. i was stuck in C5 traffic and i found myself soaking the Kleenex with tears.  i missed her. and i felt empty.  despite everything that was happening to me the last few days, there is still that empty space in me where my heart and she used to be.  i have been distracted and "cheered up" by people yet i know one day i will yearn for her again.  ---  maybe i ought to give up on us. maybe i ought to let go of whatever shred of hope i've had and have been holding on to. maybe i ought to exhale.  ---  i have to unload a lot of baggage before i can move on. and i cannot move on by simply giving my baggage to the next person who finds themself attracted to me.  i do not want to be saved by someone. i want to save myself.  ---  some peope enter our lives for reasons that we do not know about until much later, maybe even when they're gone. some enter our lives, stay, linger and take a long time to manifest what their purpose in our life is, and then go back to lingering in the background. some enter our lives, change us and affect us, and stay for good. some enter our lives, change us, affect us and influence us everyday of our lives.  i know who of my friends fall into which kind of category. nonetheless, i am thankful they have touched my life in their own little way.

      The past few days have been quite "busy" so I haven't been able to blog more often... However, I'm "introducing" a not-so-new character into my life... let's call her PS.  Her quotable quotes that made me laugh, touched me, sometimes flattered me, but always, always uplifted my feelings:    "and i don't see why you should be bothered by R either. *shrug* it's true girls go gaga for R... i should know... pero most of the time hanggang dun lang yun. her effect on people might be strong but it doesn't always last... i mean i never considered you as a crush... pero i was impressed...and up to now i still am"          "Sex is not the most intimate thing you can share with someone."          "You're so adorable."    Okay, fine, the last one was simply too self-indulgent.  But nevertheless, I felt better knowing someone else found me amusing, at the least.   She could have easily melted my heart, if only I had one.  But then again I don't.  The girl/woman formerly known as The One, hasn't given back my heart.  Either it has been broken badly and she can't put the pieces back together or she lost it.  Maybe one of these days it'll be found and repaired.  But for now, that empty hole in the center of my chest will be occupied by little joys that I encounter everyday such as my nephews, my job, and my friends and family.  Going back to PS, thank you for making me forget for some time the sh*tty crap that I am going thru.

       i came across this song just now. it doesn't really truly reflect how i feel right now. in fact, i refuse to feel too much. the only emotion i have been allowing myself to feel is just "fun". still, the song reminds me of how two souls can find each other amidst so many circumstances, situations and enviroments, be it for companionship, friendship or love.     ---   THE LAST NIGHT OF THE WORLD        CHRIS In a place that won't let us feel In a life where nothing seems real I have found you I have found you        KIM In a world that's moving too fast In a world where nothing can last I will hold you I will hold you        CHRIS Our lives will change, when tomorrow comes        KIM Tonight our hearts drown the distant drums        CHRIS And we have music all right Tearing the night A song Played on a solo saxophone A crazy sound        KIM A lonely sound        BOTH A cry that tells us love goes on and on Played on a solo saxophone It's telling me To hold you tight And dance like it's the last night of the world        CHRIS On the other side of the earth There's a place where life still has worth I will take you        KIM I'll go with you        CHRIS You won't believe all the things you'll see I know 'cause you'll see them all with me        BOTH If we're together that's when We'll hear it again A song Played on a solo saxophone A crazy sound A lonely sound A cry that tells us love goes on and on Played on a solo saxophone It's telling me To hold you tight And dance like it's the last night of the world        KIM Dreams Were all I ever knew        CHRIS Dreams you won't need when I'm through        BOTH Anywhere We may be I will sing with you Our song. . .        BOTH . . .Played on a solo saxophone So stay with me And hold me tight And dance Like it's the last night of the world
