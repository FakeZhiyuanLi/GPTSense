      One enchanting piece of music, which has been my "all-time" favorite lately is "I'm with you" by Avril Lavigne. I don't find words to describe the intensity of the song, but can't help keeping myself awed by it's eternal beauty!  ----- I'm Standing on a bridge  I'm waitin in the dark  I thought that you'd be here by now  Theres nothing but the rain  No footsteps on the ground  I'm listening but theres no sound   Isn't anyone tryin to find me?  Won't somebody come take me home  It's a damn cold night  Trying to figure out this life  Wont you take me by the hand  take me somewhere new  I dont know who you are  but I'm, I'm with you  I'm with you  im looking for a place  i'm searching for a face  is anybody here i know  cause nothings going right  and everythings a mess  and no one likes to be alone   Isn't anyone tryin to find me?  Won't somebody come take me home  It's a damn cold night  Trying to figure out this life  Wont you take me by the hand  take me somewhere new  I dont know who you are  but I'm, I'm with you  I'm with you oh why is everything so confusing  maybe I'm just out of my mind  yea yea yea   It's a damn cold night  Trying to figure out this life  Wont you take me by the hand  take me somewhere new  I dont know who you are  but I'm, I'm with you  I'm with you  Take me by the hand  take me somewhere new  I dont know who you are  but I'm, I'm with you I'm with you  Take me by the hand  take me somewhere new  I dont know who you are  but I'm, I'm with you (oh) I'm with you I'm with you... -----

      What is the purpose of my life?! How often have I've thought of this! The answer however, was pretty different every time... Making money may be one of the objectives but not the primary.  Giving it more thought: I tried to gauge "what do I want from my allotted n years?" Invariably the answer was to get satisfaction in every task I undertake. Now, satisfaction is pretty vague to quantify into the map of pragmatic world, the world we live in.  Being creative and quenching my thirst of creativity being one of my important goals, I realized that success for me is not in terms of monetory means (no matter what the need is). Success (which eventually answers my first question) comes from nearing perfection!  Perfection... yes that is the ultimate aim!

      Relationships... Quite a lot of them. A debate on the interference of professional and personal relationships exposed an entire set of theories! People often get stuck in complications owing to interference of the two.

      I'm revealing a part of my self on the web... BLOG seems to be the apparent choice of "shouting out" the thoughts, and I presume it is a good way to be listened (provided you have identified your audience :))
