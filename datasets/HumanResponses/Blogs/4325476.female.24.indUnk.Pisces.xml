       urlLink    This is my favorite picture of Grendel, taken at four-months-old in May, 2001. She's showing off her trademark look of disgust, directed at a cat cavorting a few feet in front of her.   urlLink

        Phoebe is due to whelp sometime tomorrow. I've been keeping an eye on the   urlLink  Puppycam    , and she's pretty restless.  The word on the street is that, with two litters available (and the breeders seeming to have no particular aversion to me as a human being), chances are extremely good that I'll get FutureDog from one of them. This is good. I'm really hoping for one of Phoebe's kids, though. I love her face and structure, and she'd one of the flashiest tricolors I've seen. Kim Shira, Carbon's owner, says she has a tremendous temperament. With color like that her blue kids, provided she has some, should have breathtaking tan points. Not only that, but I really like Carolyn. She gave me a lot of her time at the Coeur d'Alene show, and was so forthcoming and nice that I can't help but love her.  I had a dream about the litter last night. There were seven puppies, so that's my standing bet. I kind of want to be wrong, because the dream also had me ending up with a black FutureDog instead of blue. Oh well. As long as he doesn't grow up to be a holy terror, everything should be alright.

        The dog pictured above is  Champion Coedwig's Carbon Blue . I have high hopes that he will be the father of FutureDog.  A year and a half ago, when I decided I might want a Cardigan Welsh Corgi, I also decided to paint a "Blue Dog" type painting of Grendel (R ed Dog ). I did a Google image search to find a template to work off of and ran across   urlLink  Starbuck   . He was sitting outside the Blue Dog Studio in Carmel, CA, handsome as you please. I was in love. He was the most beautiful dog I'd ever seen, and I had to have a blue dog of my own. When I started looking for breeders I found mention of Starbuck on the   urlLink  Coedwig    website, and learned that Carbon was his dad. Since then I've hoped to end up with a Carbon kid, but didn't have much ambition about it actually happening. ( As if it couldn't be a conscious decision!  )  So I got on a couple of lists. And then I waited. And waited. And waited. A year passed, and I said to myself, "Wow, this waiting around really sucks. I want my damn dog." People wait for puppies all the time, but even after a harrowing twelve months there was no end in sight. So I decided to get proactive. I contacted Kathleen Mallery of   urlLink  Castell Pembroke Welsh Corgis   , who also has a couple of Cardigans and whom I'd met at the Boise Dog Show the year before, and told her I wanted to get the show on the road, so to speak. She recommended a few people in the Northwest (my previous options were both over a thousand miles away), and I found that Carolyn Cannon of   urlLink  C-Myste    had a bitch, Phoebe, that was recently pregnant. Her friend, Louise Sargent of   urlLink  Wolfrun    , was also expecting a litter from the same stud dog with her girl Brandy. And who do you think that dog-daddy was?  Things seem to be coming up roses for FutureDog. His dad may be one of the top Cardigans in the country.  Another breeder in Oregon, who I met at the Coeur d'Alene show in July, recently contacted me to offer me a blue girl from her current litter, who is five weeks old. If I were so inclined, I could have FutureDog five weeks from now. Tempting as that is, I think I'd regret not waiting for my dream dog. Fate has smiled on me, and it might really piss it off if I turned down its generous offer.  Two more months shouldn't be unendurable. Right?

         I have a dream.  In this dream I've written a memoir about how I started out in the dog show world. There's a picture of me on the cover in a pinstripe grey skirt-suit with blue flares (the color of this font), clutching my show lead white-knuckled and looking afraid, with the words  "DOG SHOW!"  lording over me. The alternate title,  " Or,   Grendel in the Underworld ,"  appears on the title page, with a black and white photo of Grendel grinning maniacally beneath it.  The book is heavily embellished, at least 75% so, and follows Grendel (the un-papered scrub corgi), myself, and FutureDog (the breed champion) through our descent into that third circle of hell with is showing purebred dogs competitively. It's cynical and witty. It's a guiding light for those who will follow in my footsteps.  Meanwhile, the title is too snappy to waste on what-ifs.
