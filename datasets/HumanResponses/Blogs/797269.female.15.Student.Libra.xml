       I can’t put into words how amazing Fahrenheit 9/11 is. There are so many opinions I have about it but they’re not worth listing off if you haven’t seen the movie, which, at least for me, opened up a million new thought paths. SO what you have to do is go see it AND THEN call me! I want to discuss with as many people as possible.   We signed up for the unlimited rentals thing at blockbuster. So exciting! Today will be Lost in Translation, if I get the time.   Must get ready for New York tomorrow, Cheerios audition with maybe a little shopping on the side 

       I saw Godspell last night. It was very good though completely not what I was expecting. It was all kind of musical bible stories which, unfortunately and honestly, I've never heard before. So they were interesting.  I think I'm going to see Fahrenheit 9/11 today which should be amazing. I'm gonna take Michael Moore's advice and sneak in. (It's rated R but he said if you're a teenager and you haven't figured out how to sneak into a rated R movie, you've got some problems!)

       I saw The Stepford Wives yesterday. I'm not sure I really got it. I mean, highly educated women who become stay at home moms, wear nothing but Lily Pulitzer dresses, and drive SUV's? Is that supposed to be funny or fake or something? It sounds like the Main Line to me!! Anyway, I thought it was very funny, no masterpiece, but comical and enjoyable.  I'm a little more into the routine of camp now. The days are still long, but not as long as Monday seemed. I have one girl I really like who goes to my old elementary school and she gives me massages. Sometimes I'll watch other girls while we're together but it's usually it's just me and Natalie. Camp is so small this year that that's ok. This girl Natalie, who is absolutley as small as it comes, she must weigh 40 lbs, told me today how she thinks her thighs are HUGE, that's a quote. I don't think I had that feeling till at least the end of elementary school, and she just finished 4th grade. I guess it's getting younger and younger, it's an epidemic.  Off to rehersal and Exton Diner tonight.

       Today was the first day of camp, o boy! This year I have the 3rd and 4th grade girls. After two weeks of sleeping till 12 and doing nothing but go out at night, waking up at 7:50 and spending the day with little girls who all want piggy backs and french braids is just excellent. Miss Betty died in January. It would be weird enough to go to camp with out her there, but her daughters decided about 2 weeks after her death to sell her house and all her land. Obviously camp is still going on but we're in a new location. It's much smaller and in the woods so the bugs are intense. The worst part is all the little things we won't have any more. The big bridge, walks to Big Boys, and everything else will soon be gone forever. :(

       So in the middle of the night, I have no idea why, but all of a sudden this very realistic vision came to me. I was covered in and surrounded by bugs. Spiders, grasshoppers, ticks, you name it. So, as it was very realistic and I was pretty much asleep, I sit up and start furiously throwing covers off me and backing up off my bed. (You're probably laughing at me right now, haha Ariel's pyschotic and runs away from fake bugs in the night.) Here's the incredibly serious part... I backed up on my bed so much that I fell off head first and landed with a very loud and painful thud. And I screamed. But no one woke up and came to my rescue. Here it is probably 7 hours later, and I'm still shaking.

       Triumph- Went shopping, lots of good stuff, and... mom picked up the tab!   Failure- My mom let me drive up the drive up the driveway to get the mail by myself today (hey, I have to practice somewhere!). So it goes very well, I can't back down the driveway so I spin around in the street without hitting anything and end up in perfectly in the spot at the end up the driveway. Put the emergency brake on and get out. Forgetting something? Yeah I was.  Just this tiny little detail... turning the car off! Maybe 2 hours later my mom has to go to the post office and asks where the keys are. My mistake immediately dawns on me and barefoot I sprint out to the car (trying to beat my mom). I bump my head hard trying to stick it through the slightly ajar window and finally open the door, turn the key and pull it out just in time for my mom NOT to see. Luckily, I checked the gas gauge later on and it was still at about 5/6 tank so I couldn't have wasted too much. I've decided I want to get a really crappy car because it is likely I will ruin it. It's just a fact, it will probably happen.

       So far this summer I've done, lets see, NOTHING! I should mention that I've loved every last second of it! I've done a few things worth mentioning (don't get too worried about me, all of these were followed by long naps). Saturday I went and saw Grease at Melmark (the place I volunteer). It was unbelievable. They were adorable doing dances and lip singing to the sound track. I took a ton of pictures and I will try to post them. Saturday night we had a pre-show cast bonding party. We played some very serious, hard-core wink. No joke, I was AMAZING! I pinned Madi and Katie Dare to name just a few. I just had adrenaline running through me or something, it was out of control... I'm still limping a little bit!  Sunday night was Elspeth's graduation party (shh... the director's of my show believe Sunday night to have been a very important, unmissable, end of the year, required school event... I'm so mischievous!)   Today I visited GVMS. I spent probably a good hour with Dr. S and visited Miss Acring, Mr. Whitelock, Mrs. White, and many many others. I'm happy to report the school is holding up adequately without me. When I got home I watched the first two chapters of Angels in America on OnDemand... so good! If you don't have OnDemand, rent it! Everyone should see it.   Ah! Time for rehearsal already!

       Yes, that's rigth. I advise all to advoid middle school band parties which may become extremely out of hand. Take the case of Forrest's party last Saturday. A bunch of trumpet playing, homework doing, kids are having a party with their parents when *gasp* a seemingly innocent game of rugby gets out of hand and a trumpet player, my brother, is tackled. He subsequently bites his lip and ends up in the emergency room getting stitches in his mouth! No more trumpet playing for Forrest, well for a while at least.  I believe I have a very severe case of summeritis. Getting up out of bed to eat or talk on the phone takes a new remarkable amount of energy now. Going to hang out with people or going to things which are supposed to be fun like graduation parties and the movies have become almost impossible tasks. I'm not really sure if it will be possible for me to go back to school in 3 months.  I rented Mystic River and I'm so excited to watch it!

       That's right! Freshmen year is completely over! I'm done the ridiculous 6 exams and even the SAT II I had to wake up at 7AM for this morning is completely, utterly, undeniably, 100% OVER!  O, I'm back! Long time no see to blogger.com. The new format is, uh, well it's weird. I'll get used to it. I like that people can comment... you all better leave me lots!  I just got amaaazing news! Ray's going to Fordham next year so he and Quiara are living in Manhattan! Whooooo!*excited but dorky and very loud scream*. I will be there CONSTANTLY! Yeah, I go to New York by myself now. So basically I'm only THE coolest person, uh, ever? I think Mary, Caroline, Annie and I are going to go see Wicked next week... gotta catch Kristen before she's gone forever!  Also!!!!!!!!!! I drive now! (Just so you don't steer completely clear of all roads in fear of me, you should know that by "drive" I mean down my little dead end street AND turn into my driveway. So if you live on Tinkherhill Lane, be very afraid, but if not, you're safe... for the next 4 months at least.)

       I think about blogging everyday. Something funny happens and I think, "huh, maybe the millions of anxious blog fans would enjoy this story", but then I never tell it.   Went to Avalon and stayed with Kate. At least 20 of her brother's college friends were there too plus some haverford guys and carter and maclae.
