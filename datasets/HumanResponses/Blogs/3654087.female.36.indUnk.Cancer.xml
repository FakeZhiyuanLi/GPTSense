      Well, here I am, 5 days until the "Big Day".  Not that it's even going to be that big.  Just like every other little girl, I always dreamed of a beautiful princess-like wedding.  But, alas, poor Yorick, it is not to be for me.  Since we have to pay for everything ourselves, we had to choose between a dinky little wedding and nothing else, or a courthouse wedding and a nice 2 weeks vacation time.  We opted for the second choice.  On the bright side, I do get a husband out of this, so I'm zippin' my lip!!  I am kind of afraid if I were to complain TOO much, he will change his mind, or at least postpone it again.  I just want it all to be overwith so I can just RELAX!  I tend to worry about things until they reach catostrophic proportions.  10 pages of drama, wherever you turn!  What a long and winding road Dan & I have traveled.  You could fill 2 Oprah shows (and 1 Jerry Springer) with our life.  We never seem to get through anything without some chaos.  But, the most important thing about all of this, the reason I want to do all of this, is because I love him, and want to spend the rest of my life with him, for good or bad, richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, and all that crap.  I couldn't imagine my life without him.  I assume he feels the same way about me.  I know he loves me, though I am a bit of a pill.  So is he.  Still love him anyway.  Wonder what our Golden Years will be like?  We'll probably be sailing around on a houseboat, bickering like little old ladies, but still in love.  Either that or I will be stowing away to Tahiti with Daisy and MLC.

      My co-workers are having a wedding shower for me today.  I am suprised and touched that they would do this for me.  At the same time, though, there is this teeny little voice in the back of my head telling me I don't deserve it.  I think part of that teeny little voice stems from the fact that Dan & I have been together for over 18 years, and are just now getting married.  It also stems from the fact that we are only having a courthouse wedding.  But the rest of me is very excited, because I thought this day would NEVER come!  As those close to me know, I struggle with a lot of self-doubt, and being self-centered.  I KNOW, "Everything is not always about me", but sometimes I can't help it.  I can be a very complicated and sometimes difficult person.  But, "People is Messy".  If Daisy Chain is like a soft pretzel, I am like a croissant - slightly bent, flaky on the outside, but soft and with a lot of layers on the inside.  I wonder what type of gifts I will get today?  I am not the typical bride, after all - I am in my mid-thirties, have already had a home of my own for 5 years, and we have a teenaged son.  It's not like we need sets of wineglasses or plate settings.  Whatever I do, get though, I will truly appreciate, because the thought really DOES count.  The "groom" can't be there, because he can't get out of work, it being their busiest season.

      I am (almost) 36, mother of a 16 year old punk teenage boy, and on the verge of getting married to my "high school sweetheart", whom I have been dating for (get this) over 18 years.  What can I say?  We are very very backwards about life.  We met as teenagers, had a child together, then moved in together, then bought a house, then decided to get married.  The blame for starting this blog lies completely on the shoulders of Daisy Chain, whom I work with and who is a very kind, very funny, and very complex person. She is the Internet Guru of the two of us, and somehow got me hooked. Unfortunately, most people don't see the true Daisy Chain.  She's kind of like those pretzels you buy at the mall - once you get past the crusty, hard-baked outside, you find something warm and soft inside.  She somehow puts up with me (at least most of the time), only snapping when I have pushed too far.  I work in Corporate America (just like Daisy Chain), drive a HOT sports car, and love anything pink and/or Hello Kitty.  I have come to the conclusion that I am the reincarnation of a spoiled princess, i.e. I hate to work hard, love to have things done for me, and I have expensive taste.  I think this is all I am going to say for now, especially since I am at work and would definitely LIKE to keep my job.

       Well, it's now more than a month since I got married.  I expected to update sooner, but things have been crazy!  The wedding went fine - just as you would expect a courthouse civil ceremony to go.  I was slightly nervous, and I can't remember ANY of the vows the judge had us repeat.  I think I promised to love him forever or some cr** like that.  Just kidding, the vows meant a LOT to me, and I truly hope to be a good wife to him.  I MUST love him, to still want to marry him in spite of the fact that he's a difficult-to-live-with-butthead.  We had a lovely view of some low-risk convicts doing gardening outside the courthouse window, which gave a lovely ambience to the wedding day.  We spent the rest of the day cleaning the house and cars, and packing for our honeymoon trips.      First trip was to Southern Illinois, specifically to the Rend Lake, Carbondale, and Shawnee National Forest areas.  Yuk, what a long, boring drive.  Nothing but farms, small towns and cellular towers as far as the eye could see.  We had some interesting times, including finding a TEENY little town called Lick Creek, and I finally caught a fish, small as it was.        Second (and third) trip was to South Haven, Michigan.  VERY nice little beach town, with the most AWESOME ice cream shop called Sherman's.   We spent most days lounging around the beach, relaxing, tanning, etc.  We also visited Saugatuck, and Holland (when Dan lost his wedding ring in Lake Michigan and we had to get him a new one).  It was definitely hard to go back to work after 16 days of relaxation.      Well, the kid comes home from Scottsdale, AZ this weekend.  I miss having him around, but I don't miss the stress and the mess of him.  It will be back to lots of dishes and laundry, and lots of bickering.  His dad is VERY bullheaded, and so is he, so we're in for a LOT of arguments.  We'll have to see who comes out the winner.  Somehow I have a feeling the kid is either going to have to do a lot of compromising, or he'll just have to leave.  It would break my heart, but I can't let him manipulate me or get away with any blatant disrespect or irresponsibility anymore.  Boy is it HARD to be a parent.  I NEVER knew how mind-blowingly difficult it is.  As they say. "Someday he'll thank me".  I hope.         T.T.F.N.  !!
