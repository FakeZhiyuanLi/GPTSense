      dreams and dreams circle my mind like twisters of images of thought's, pillars of light blue and orange come close enough to pull me in. encircled by the light i see myself i also see land, a forest green in rich, birds fly in the air,beatifully serene,an eerie yet bewitching light shot's through the leaves, screams at my soul rosonates in my heart, Reminds me of the air of the forgotten dreams of times so long ago erased by the time and the anger of sorrow. Arrows of water now make way to ponds and streams where images and figures form and dance in the tides, trees with so many stories to tell of the old, wishing to move to better spot's they find themselves unable to. An exile with nature forms around forgotten by life, steps and leaps are near and far,knowledge put at rest by the fading blue.

      HA!!!!! Im free, from the roach infested, place called summer school, i have a sore back as a suveneir, damn chair's, this leads me to another topic, now that im free this has cleared up 7.5 hrs in a day of noting to do there are many things to do but after a while i'll probboly have done everything. call this the 2nd sight but i see myself doing alot more cooking than usuall and working on organising my room which will take about 2 day's, becouse oncei start cleaning my mind eye sees something and starts reminicing. I might as weel go back to doing my art projects becouse those projects of mine take up alot of space, either that i can go to the bookstore and catch up on my literature. I sent a friend of mine (who i will call anonymous) an e-mail which sounded very, very random, sorry if it doesn't make sense.

      Today's has been a weird day, for one people are actually talking to me and im talking to them and all it took was me handing someone a book.anyaway on another scale ive had a calling, not the whole oh look it's destiny this is more of like hey what's you're number, This like happened in class and i was like what!, and she was like yeah my friend qwants you're #, and i was like who is you're friend, and the massenger was like, "well you'll have to give her you'ree # and see", while i was like you're friend sent you or yo sent you're self? And she again was like you'll have to see and i was like yeah, i was tempted to put the name of my teacher Mr hebert on it and put it on his desk, so he could think it was for him, but i was like better not, i don't want to be that mean, he hasn't done anything to prevoke me like other teachers who have been complete asses twards me. I actually avoided the whole my # is..... becouse she got of topic and started asking me questions such as where were you born.....e.t.c, anyway im actually almost done with my report ive done an out line all io have to do is put in the right order and use a million words for like one word, since it has to be 750 words minimun and 4 pages long. and i also have a states capitols test to take that day when i turn it in(the report), i actually know the states i just don't know all the capitols i know some, like most of the southern capitols I just realized i have a bad habitt of using the word     like   I sound like poeple from the valley, well no i don't i just have a habit of using the word like but not the phrase  like oh my god

      you know when it's that time of the time and you feel horny as hell becouse A) you have an overactive sexual dreams B) been reading to many sexually charged movies, B) you keep having those thoughts that won't let you be. Anyway i need to find a creative outlet for all the sexual energy i have, drawing just won't cut it anymore i need to pursue more time consuming and energy consuming activities, which will most likely include short stories, some type of creative creations. ANyway besides that nothings new with me just same old same old stuff school. oh yeah ive talked to alyssa like some two hrs ago, it's been ages since i talked to her well ever since i left my previous/ former lovely school *obese tears* god i miss those day's, they seem like memories from like a long, long time ago. hey got to go im getting kinda hungry (not in that sexual way, but in the starving way) well better go make myself some food.

      Well today is today and my family will never change, especially mine, which in my terms means there's another family fight this time it's my mom whose angry at her roomate who happens to be my aunt. This isn't anything new this squables have been going on for like a long time ago, but this time there getting more violent, and stupid, such an example of why they're getting stupid is that for some reason my aunt keeps involving my mom's best friend in everything when they get into fight's saying, "if it was for her you'd do anything". I personally think she's jealous becouse my mom has a better friend than she does or she just wants her to herself, but i dont know. These fight's are slowly escalating to the point where all it this anger needs is just a spark to burn like hell, and that spark will no doubtedly invovle me. Anyway on a lighter note my school is infested with roaches, this morning when i was waiting for the bell to ring i had to take a piss real bad and i didn't feel like going to the second floor so i went to the first floor bathroom and so the lights were off and so i walked in a step and turnes on the light next thing i see are like a shit load of roaches moving around and im like "WHHAT THE HELL!" and i walked out and like a few followed me out. so i was like ok i can take my chances and go back inside there and get to the  other side of the wall where all the stalls are and take a piss and most likely have roaches jump out of everywhere and attack me until im on the ground having my skin eaten by roaches, or i can delay for another minute or two and go upstairs and take a piss where it migfht be safer? "I think i'll go to the second floor" Afterwards i kept seeing roaches here and there in the halls and i was like damn where's The Department of public Health.while on the subject of school ive got a 4 page/750 word minimun report on Holland/Netherlands to do -yay- me im just shining with joy that its just to unrealistic *tear* and another *obese tear*.

Anyway guess what?

      Ive finally remembered the reason why i never eat with the family during breakfest,lunch or dinner. Im trying to eat something,Macaroni to be exact we=family doesn't ccok anything special unless it's for a special occasion. So while we were all sithing down beginng to eat my grandfather(whose staying for a visit)was like to my cousin=obssesed with animals, turn on the T.V. SO next thing i know they're watching Animal Planet and my grandfather is like "turn up the volume". So i at the time had started eatng and didn't realize what they had put on t.v so i decide to look up and whola next thing i know im looking at a tigers drooping and Im like "W.T.F, im trying to eat here and you the t.v on to a guy whose collecting tiger dropings". while loving Family is like oh it's just animals, which in turns causes me to loose my appetite and im like damn i luv macaroni and  can't enjoy due to the fact that you're looking at aniaml drropings and the tiger digestion system.

      Today's tip of the day Don't eat the food Where most of the people are more obese than you'll ever be. such an example would be little ohh Steak Country good it's nothing but re-greased meat upon more meat and flovoring. while i held back the urge to go puke and be like ewwwwwwwww. I most;y stickd to the salad which with it's little variety had a weird a week leftover taste to it. Anyway the restaurant wasn't all that bad ok it all was bad except for the uhm person(guy)who i passed path's with he was so CUTE and he saw me looking and had like okay he's looking at me whatever. i coud even see him if i turned around since all i had to do was look back and i could see him i kept doing this and my mom was like "what are you looking at" and of course i was Like im looking at the bathrooms since i feel like taking a piss. Again never go to Steak & country buffet if you're in houston It's  obesity central  i wouldn't have gone but against my will i was forced to go Hmph damn.

      Oh cruel hearted summer, im going to die of boredoom this is the end result of transfering schools against you're will kicking and screaming and refusing to make any type of contact with people just to piss of my mom and aslo the fact that 50% of dearest NHS pisses you off & the other 50% you don't know and they don't know you. Then again i do take that back i wasn't that anti-social when i think about it i actually did have one or two friends but they happened to be seniors who are now GONE a TRIP out of the states *tear*. I NEED TO GET A JOB and slave away at the counter somewhere.

      The zoo just cam eback from it, well we went yesterday, well no we didn't we went to the souronding area's such as the par, i went to the Japanese garden nearby, and again today it was fun if you just ignore the heat and stuff, well you can enjoy it more, see some animal's exhibit's get some sun on you're, because i haven't seen any&nbsp;unless it's artificial light&nbsp;hahaha, i seriously in a long time have not seen&nbsp;real sun light i have seen from a distance been outside for&nbsp;what at the max 15-30&nbsp;minutes, but today and yesterday i saw what 4 hrs of sunlight but then there are those 5-8 minutes that i would spend from time to time in the shadows. The zoo was kind of empty for the most part there were people but not alot. Anyhow i don't feel lke talking about the zoo anymoremore guess what? I'm dying my hair brown back to it's original color, I am bleached at the moment, in any case I'll probobly bleach it again in a couple of weeks. Let's see i attended a quincenara There's a accent on the 2nd n i would have place dit but don't know how, but as it's been &nbsp;Americanized it is more often called a 15, the female rite of passage into womanhood. From the begining i had mixed feelings about it, so to everyone reading this don't make a decision's that take up time by Flipping a coin it's sad i did and twice but i had mixed feelings about so that's why i did, i was thinking it's a 15 their bounf to have soem good food, and i don't feel like going stayin inside, but then there's also the con's which were what if the food is bad what if they have a terrible band, what if i sit and do nothing my mom told me that we were going to be there for 3 or4 hrs so that assured me more and put me in a position to flip a coin, afterwards i regreted flipping that coin twice....................... more to come in the next entry about it

      As it turn's out i was supposed call alex the other day, i saw her&nbsp;working at Torrid&nbsp;today and i was i knew i forgot to do something, and she was like yes so call me today and so after this I'm going to go call her, so when ca catch up and&nbsp; talk about why coach bottom's left to Memorial without telling us. It's very tirying going to the mall everyday now, we've been going to the mall almost everyday now shoping, and it's really been tiring my legs since i happen to intentionally wonder off and walk non-stop everywhere, I'm goin gmostly to torrid to keep an eye on those jeans, i could go to hot topic and buy them for a higher price but i choose to wait and so i can be like mom i need money i would buy them if i have enough but my money mysteriously vanished when someone asked for gas money preferably&nbsp;you and since i don't have a job i think you owe me! Today is one of those day's where im just looking around the web and listening to random music, at the current moment I'm listening to Alanis morisete and I'm going to listen to Bjork, haha while talking about alanis as it turns out I'm listening to that you oughta know song&nbsp;  thesupposed Female anthem , she sounds like such a crackwhore in this song it's true, she really sounds like one in this song tear. well The relative's have decided to stay a week longer than expected 3 day's *morbidly obese tears* my poor legs they're going to die if i keep walking like this.

      Well Im feeling happily bummed out today, i guess it happened after i ran&nbsp; into Thad at the mall today, well he actually saw me from a distance so i guess it was him.&nbsp; When i started to approach him my eye's felt stinging/burning as if though they were on fire. So when i talked to he was like guess what happened at Wais, and are you returning next year and me i was like Unsure! i actually would have talked to him longer but he was with soemone and so unfortanetely he was like see u later. and so afterwards since he was the first person/ link&nbsp; from WAIS that i had actually physically spoken and felt, since i left there, everyone else I've seen online and haven't seen them in actuall people,* tear, Anyhow this kinda got me down becouse he was a real nice guy to me and i don't even remember how the hell i met him, but seriously he was the only guy who actually would have spent an entire conversation, unlike the most of the other males at wais who only stared, gave a small hello and goodbye and can i borrow a pen or pencil&nbsp;and then there's&nbsp; evil&nbsp;eye's some would do all&nbsp;becouse of who a i was friends with, this is an idiotic&nbsp; thing they did that alway's pissed me of. Anyway where was i, yeah so after he left i was left with a feeling of loneliness and longing to what i didn't have anymore, even though it kind of put a werid Ironic smile on my face, and the rest of the day i spent with that feeling whether&nbsp; at the mall which i spent some hr's inside with the family shoping for their need's ( i really need to buy some clothe's) oh remindin me i saw thse wickedly cool pant's at Torrid, yes Torrid even though it's a store for womam's alternative sizes as they say,&nbsp; and I'm not even a size 12 which is the minimun size they have. But still I'm like what a few sizes away, and I'm used to wearing loose clothing, even though i have to hold them up with a belt becouse if they don't they'll slip to my lower waist and so forth. Anyhow as i was saying yes it might be a store for woman, I would actually wear some type of female clothing if it isn't to feminine&nbsp;or revealing, and so forth. mI'm actually used to it in a weird way because A) whn i was in elementary school my mom had a habbit when i didn't have any vlean clothes she'd give me one of her shir'ts or jeans, and she'd send me off and most of the time i was so clueless to what i was wearing, and not until i wa soutside I'd be all like wait since when are these my clothing and so as you can guess after a while i was like whatever, but this stopod at the end of 4th grade becouse she didn't want me getting queerish ideas, which is very ironic considering how I'm bi and stuff, Oh my god i remeber this one incident in 4th grade whn i didn't have any clean uniform pant's and so we were in a hurry and my mom was in her room and i was like complaining about how i didn't have any clean pant's and so she was like here put this on and get ready, and so i put them and i was mortified because these were her short, short's that were what 1.5-2.5 inches away from my crotch, can you imagine a male 4th grader in very revealing short, shorts, i actually tried to lower them but when i did&nbsp; most of my ass was exposed and so in the end i gave up with trying to lower them. Whn i arrivewd at school it was okay becouse people choose to ignore it or not comment or what ever. and so in the end i didn't get up or stretch because i was paranoid and didn't want people looking up my shorts to see everything. But still I'm going to buy those jeans' because,&nbsp; A) they are on clearence, B) the male version of those jeans are extremely heavy and it feel's like I'm doing exercises in them.......One step.............two steps..................threeeeeeeeeeeeee steps. and so forth.

      The search for family the lost family member's was high and low it began at 1:00 in the morning i barely had any sleep when all the sudden the phone rang, it was them saying they'd arrive and they need assistance getting here (where we live) So mom and aunt, plus my uncle who woulf be there in a jiffy went to look for them. So i stayed home waiting to take phone calls if they called, the phone had been of limit's for anyone to use. i was able to convince my mom to let me use it for 20 minutes which allowed me to do some stuff but not&nbsp; a lot. ANyhow so they called(mom) saying if they had called, becouse there aren't any Shell gas stations on N, shephard, and so i waited then they called it was almost 2:30 in the morning whe they called (visitng family) Adn where like we are located in so and so near a greenhouse. so i called mom and gave the location of were they, so when mom arrived she was like where th hell are they if been going in circles in the location they gave me. So they came home and left my uncle to search for them by this time it was 3:30, and i was being blamed , and i was like what the hell, you're blaming me becouse you can't find them, what was i supposed to do tell them to make a left on the next light, if you couldn't even find how was i supposed to know where they are. This of course shut up my aunt and her bitching. SO we waited a while and mom told my uncle t stop looking so, we decided to wait and see if they would call or soemthing, so by now it was 4:20 or somewhere around there.  So this time we were told they were in rosenburg, they had gooten ion the freeway and missed the exit and wound up over there. So i went this tiem becouse A) my mom didn't want to listen to my aunt's complaint's B) if they called she'd probobly&nbsp; write down every thing thy said, from pauses to every word per word. C) she needed to give my uncle (who was now on the search with us again) they're cell phone number's which i had to reapeat by memory, becouse they were inmy mom's cell phone now and she was calling my uncle to give then to hin and so only havin seen them 5 times in that day&nbsp; was like 265&nbsp;-8889 and so forth *note this isn't the actuall number this is a made up number so it doesn't in anyway link to me. SO we were ehading out to resenburg which is what 30-40 minutes away. so onthe way there we run into dearest uncle, who happens to have as a choufer one of his many mistresses. so we find them and it's already by this point it's almost 6 so we spend a whilke there 10-15 minutes just chatting and asking &nbsp;what happened? SO when i was outside i saw my uncle looking like he'd been doing some hard partying, and at that moment i had a memory flas to a couple of years back when we were on a trip to mexico city in car and there really weren't that many car's on the road, and so i remember we were besides this truck and i looked at and next thing i know i see 2 people a guy and a girl, the girl is leaning to the guy's side she's facing the rider's window and i see her bend her head down and then comes up again and so i was like oh my god she's giving him head, and i also was like that must be hard for that guy to concentrate on driving while his wife or girlfriend or whatever give's him head. and so i was like oh my god when i saw my uncle and his new girl, which really didn't surprise em becouse he has different girlfriends at different time of the day and week. so back to the family it took a while longer ecouse we went around the galeria area so we didn't have to pay the toll. so now it was like what past 7 se when we got home and my aunt was like it' hard not knowing a city. and so to make thing's more welcoming my uncle invited is to breajfest at Ihop and so my aunt was like are you kidding I'm not dressed properly and i was like this is free breakfest at Ihop and I'm in partial pijamas so what the hell. So she didn't go becouse she wasn't dreesed and showered for the occasion. So WHile we were eating i discovered that my visiting family and my uncles girlfriend have knowledge of beliefs and remedies we were talking about re-incarnation, but mostly about oil's and blends and what the are good for and superstitious beliefs about certain oil's while eating. So the basic meaning of this story is that i don't tink there''s one but it hink it is alway's choose a point where you're going to pick up soemone choose a specific location. well that's that

      Well are these new upgrades? or have they been here for a while and i just haven't noticed before/ what ever the case it's very resourcefull new upgrades. Today has been a day of news my aunt from tampico alongside her family are comimg to visit on the 25th, for 3 day's of sight seeing, and shooping, which should be fun if, my room wasn't before time offered as a welcomiming for them to sleep in, they won't get much sleep there are birds and insects who sing and croak outside my window every other night. SO again to the seeing and shooping this will be another good excuse to drive to katy mall and blow our money, hehe. So yesterday in due to my insomnia i saw the most interesting short story called evelyn the cuttest evil dead girl, it's avery interesting gothic twist about the age old long story of tryin to fit in somewhere and making friends, even though it was 6 minutes long it was still interesting. Anyhow I think im getting i'm getting a cold, which is a real drag. : (

      So i was watching Vh1 the awesome 90's and stuff and so even though there are a couple of good moments in the 90's that show is just going to be another excuse to play and talk about kurt cobain and nirvana up until 94,95 and make references to him in other dates.  I like curt cobain i think he was a very down to earth vey cool writter and stuff;but after having to hear nirvana day after day on t.v. the media just killed him again and this time it didn't take courtney love to kill him. THis time the media and magazines killed him. Take for example nirvana it's now mostly focused on curt cobain and whenever it is his death anniversary there's pre-nirvana weekend and then there's the actuall nirvana remembrece day where they play nirvana music all day. and yo u feel like screamng enough. then there's het post after wekend celbration and in the end you wind up not wanting to hear nirvana for ever.

      This is actually the 2nd post ive written the other one i accidentaly forgot to post or save it as some sort of draft. So instead of writting what i wrote in the previous one I'll write something else let's see. so Yesterday i learned the value of symapthy, yes i sympithise for all the people who house clean with vacums everyday yes i do, after having used one yesterday for the very first time and having it accidentally attack( don't know how but it stated sucking a piece of my jeans and i was like oh my god it's alive and my mom was like basterd this can only happen you. Anyway the reason i was using a vacum for the vey first time was that my mom bribed me into helpinng her preapare/clean one of her best friends house so that when she arrived her house would be clean(isn't my mom thoughtful) and it's also due to the fact that she's the caretaker while my mom's friend is on vacation. So the vacum cleaner it's hell it's like doing aerobic exercises while pulling backa nd fourth a heavy machine. SO anyway while i was searching through some files on bloger like who like's what i like i noticed no one like's the poseidon adventure, or the movie Heather's, hasn't anyone heard of cult classics, it's probobly just me im like a film fanatic and stuff.

      Bam I officially need glasses after doing an experiment with myself, becouse what's the point of going to get you're sight checked and not have anything wrong with you're sight and have to later pay $60.00 or more for an eye exam. SO instead of doing this now i did a home expiremnt by trying to see the letter's at a distance with how  they test you with the letter's with different sizes. so in the end i came up with I NEED GLASSES i realized this a while ago and pushed it a side. While on the subject of expirents I've done a couple now, such as i accidentally magnetised my earphones i don't know how exactly,also i have MAgically fixed The print gear studio software. now that i think about i my self have not on purpose done any of this things ony accidentally, well that's one big bummer. hehe anyway u actually am experimenting with myself im kind of tired of the image im projecting, such as bleached hair for all i lkeit it's loosing it's once magnetic attraction, and i don't feel like wasting $12.00 on hair dye im actually going to do one of the following  A) do more experimenting with bleach ive learned a couple of tricks to make bleach come out a light reddish color or B) go to Fiesta and buy japanesse$5.00 hair dye.

      misty fog blocking the shallow stars, iphurita nothing but a small, fragmented shadow, looming in the east of west, fire a blaze in the green eyes, walking in the streets of time, corridors leading forward, door's leading no where, Windows unable to open lit by everwatching candles.  So guess what i forgot to mention a couple of day's it was jim morrison's anniversary on the july the 3th, i remembered yesterday when i was listening to light my fire, when i suddenly remembered hey it was his passing anniversary on the 3d. Today today what a day not really, it's just been bleaker.I spent all this morning remembering a Tragic Fairy tale from when i was younger,yes there are such things as tragic fairy tales,i finally remembered all the datails to it, the story is basically like the little mermaid, but the differences are the sea hag isn't evil, she doesn't interfeare, actually she just makes bargain's, the bargain the mermaid made was that she also had three day's to get the prince's heart and if she didn't onthe mornng of the 3rd day she would turn into bubbles and disipate into the wind. So when she goes to the prince she tries and the prince by his own will falls in love with another girl. And so the prince invites her to go with him and his new lover to go to the sea in his boat.so when her sisiter's find out,(dady doesn't rescue her)so they  sneak into the sea hag's cave and look for how to break the spell, so in the morning on the 3rd day they tell her she must drive a knife through his heart in order to break the spell, so she finds herself in his room with a knife in her hands, she looks at his face nad finds herself unable to and heads up the deck where she waits for morning and her sister's ask her why didn't she, she responds I can't kill him i love him to much, i would ratehr turn into bubbles and be around him fore ever, than never be with him, and so it ends with her turning into bubbles and dissapearing into the wind. This i think was one of those stories that gave me an early belief that there is no such thing as Happily ever after, and this was about when i was 7 or 8, it's amazing what i can remeber from when i was younger.

      misty fog blocking the shallow stars, iphurita nothing but a small, fragmented shadow, looming in the east of west, fire a blaze in the green eyes, walking in the streets of time, corridors leading forward, door's leading no where, Windows unable to open lit by everwatching candles.  So guess what i forgot to mention a couple of day's it was jim morrison's anniversary on the july the 3th, i remembered yesterday when i was listening to light my fire, when i suddenly remembered hey it was his passing anniversary on the 3d. Today today what a day not really, it's just been bleaker.I spent all this morning remembering a Tragic Fairy tale from when i was younger,yes there are such things as tragic fairy tales,i finally remembered all the datails to it, the story is basically like the little mermaid, but the differences are the sea hag isn't evil, she doesn't interfeare, actually she just makes bargain's, the bargain the mermaid made was that she also had three day's to get the prince's heart and if she didn't onthe mornng of the 3rd day she would turn into bubbles and disipate into the wind. So when she goes to the prince she tries and the prince by his own will falls in love with another girl. And so the prince invites her to go with him and his new lover to go to the sea in his boat.so when her sisiter's find out,(dady doesn't rescue her)so they  sneak into the sea hag's cave and look for how to break the spell, so in the morning on the 3rd day they tell her she must drive a knife through his heart in order to break the spell, so she finds herself in his room with a knife in her hands, she looks at his face nad finds herself unable to and heads up the deck where she waits for morning and her sister's ask her why didn't she, she responds I can't kill him i love him to much, i would ratehr turn into bubbles and be around him fore ever, than never be with him, and so it ends with her turning into bubbles and dissapearing into the wind. This i think was one of those stories that gave me an early belief that there is no such thing as Happily ever after, and this was about when i was 7 or 8, it's amazing what i can remeber from when i was younger.

      As i lay on my knees on the bathroom floor puking, my brain couldn't have made my puking any easier instead it was giving me a killer headache, and the people outside the bathroom floor asking are you alright, really didn't help at all, after i was done the pain was also gone and left me with a bitter anger towards frozen food's that you leave in the freezer and never eat due to the fact it was food that you've never heard of and what it was didn't have an appealing sound, such as bread filled with cream cheese from the inside, i ate it due to the fact that i was starving and there where wasn't anything edible to eat. I also think i puked due to tha fact that im sick.ANyhow after i puked i was calm and i started thinking and well my mind came up with a Thank's fr putting up with me so here you go and so my mind came up with this crappy story plot about love,revenge,Atlantis,the sea god,Re-incarnation,& divine winter witches/guardians, i have an idea of the story plot.This is what i have so far the Witch/guardian( don't have a name yet)Fell in love with the sea god and so did the sea god. The were madly in love with each other until the people of altlantis weakend and destroyed him.... it goes on so I''l just say it plainly she attacks and destroys atlantis, other  countries hear of what the guardian did and so the people threaten to go to war with them so the guardians not wanting to go to war forever decide to kill the one who destroyed atlantis, and start with that guardian from the begining.So they do, but what nobody knows about them is that wether they all die they will return becouse that's how they go on they are all the re-incarnations of the original guardian's, so wether they are killed the will be guardians forever until the end of time. Same with the sea god reborn again but not as a god. That's what i have so far im thinking of changing some stuff it sounds kinda crappy but you could never know. On some lighter subject it's the 4th of july yipee, not really it's just another excuse for people to get drunk as hell and accidenatlly burn up someones house wit fireworks, fireworks are cool but when you get outside there are alot of idiot's who do the most stupid thing's with fireworks, such as oh i wonder what happen's if i aim this to the floor ? this is not a lie ive actually heard people say this with fireworks and i'm like oh my god. Im almost temppted to go to a public place and say" "hey whose ridding the shooting star headed towards us". That's just mean but funny nonetheless, i don't know i wouldn't want to cause hysteria among the crowd.

      So today is another of those day's where my morning turned out to be one of those sour it's like you eat something expired, bitter and afterwards it leave's an after taste in you're mouth when you've eaten it. This was due to the fact that my mom and I got into a ridiculous squable about the elusive yet out of all the  reason's to fight about we fighted about "CLOTHES", this is one of those anoying fight's were we start talking about something and lead's to another subject like why my grades are sometimes bad, she knows im smart it's just that i get distracted easily, and this leads to something else and more fighting. After an 2.5 hrs we calmed down and were like okay. Afterwards i was still feeling moody, but it wasn't regular moody this was a different kind of moody the mood i was feeling was differnt it was a type of feeling where it feels as though you're soul is flying but yet is imprisoned underground, i feel happy but sad at the same time, more in tuned but out of my sense's, the type of feeling where shadow's whisper seductive things to you're soul and so forth. i was trying to understand the  reason behind my emotions when i started feeling this way i was like Okay i feel this way after a fight, i feel sad but connected none the less, in the end i just gave up trying to understand my emotions since i will never understand them completely. This thought sometimes makes me wonder or contemplate?

Nothing last's here. Moving on guess what i bought an uberly cool mesenger bag the other day for $10, and it's not one of those small one's it's actually one of htose big one's with lot's of space for everything, plus it's red and it was the last one i was so happy because ive always wanted messneger bags before but they are to expensive and stuff.
