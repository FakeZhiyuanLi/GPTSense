      Last night David and Corey and I went to the Waffle House. We ended up meeting Bethany and Diana and CeCe and Bubba there too. We had fun, but they started talking about getting drunk and stuff, and I could tell David was just kinda...I dunno. Not upset but, just didn't want any part of that. Anyway, I went home and he called around midnight and we ended up staying on the phone all night (or shall I say morning). He is just so amazing, and he's the kind of person that makes me wanna be the best that I am. I've never met such a strong Christian and amazing person. I can't even describe it. He's leaving to go back to FL tomorrow, and I don't know what I'll do when he's gone.....

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my first entry, and I have nothing too great to say! Well, the most interesting thing in my life right now is that David (my best friend who moved away a year ago) is in town, and coincidently, this whole time he's been living the same place where Josh (my ex) is from. But...they don't know each other. David only says that he's heard&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh is a complete ass hole, which is totally true.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no way to summarize mine and Josh's story, so I will just put it this way: Josh and I were once "together" and at one time I thought he really cared about me, but the way it ended up, he is now with Tami, a "friend" I work with, and I ended up hurt. And so will Tami once she realizes who he really is and his true intentions.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's about all I have to say about Josh. Now I like Casey, who used to like me. But someone from the restaraunt where I work told Casey that me and Josh were together, and we're NOT, so Casey stopped talking to me because he "didn't wanna take someone else's girl." Well I saw his dad in the restaraunt a couple of weeks later, and told him to tell Casey to call me. Casey called, and to my astonishment, found out he's "talking" to Lauren, who is a girl I used to be friends with. Lauren is a really good person I believe, but the only thing I am concerned about is the way she goes through boyfriends, like they're paper towels she can just wipe her hands on and then go on to the next one. I know if she ends up with Casey, she will just end up breaking up with him for another guy, the way the last million of her relationships have ended/begun, and it will hurt Casey. And I really like Casey... but I don't know how to warn him without him thinking that I'm just jealous (which I am slightly, but that's NOT the reason that I don't want him with her).   But anyway, David's here, and it's a good distraction for me. I've missed him so much, and I enjoy spending time with him. I just with time could slow down before he has to leave.
