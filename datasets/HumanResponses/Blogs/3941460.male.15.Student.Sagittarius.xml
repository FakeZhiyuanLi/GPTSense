       Blah, it's a Monday...although, this one wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Work went by kinda fast, and I got to get soaked towards the end of the day...which was nice, because it was really hot. Yesterday my brother left. He came down for the weekend from Indiana, so that's always cool. He had some bad news though, because&nbsp;he and his girlfriend, of four and a half years, broke up on the way here, so that's no good. But we had fun; it was my niece's first birthday party on Saturday, and later that night we all went mini-putting at Volcano Falls.&nbsp;Sunday he left after playing golf with my parents and eating lunch with all of us. Then after that I went to get clothes for school...uniforms, but I also got a cool, new outfit for the weekends and the rest of the summer. Anyway, that's 'bout it for now...later.

        No, I don't have all of the bootlegs of all of my favorite artists. I don't know the name of every band member of all the bands I listen to. But, if you know me at all, you'll know that I'm almost always either listening to or watching music. And, when I'm watching something other than music, there's almost always music playing in the background. No CD player around? Not a problem for me, because well...there's usually one of my favorite songs running through my head. &nbsp;    &nbsp;   I guess before I get into why I listen to so much music, I should explain what music I tend to listen to...and there's no easier way in doing so then typing up a list of CDs I currently own. My fingers are going to be hurting... &nbsp;      :: Aerosmith&nbsp;- A Little South Of Sanity &nbsp;   :: AFI - Sing The Sorrow    :: The All-American Rejects - The All-American Rejects    :: Anavox - A New Voice    :: Audioslave - Audioslave    :: Blues Traveler - Four    :: Blues Traveler - Live From The Fall    :: Brand New - Deja Entendu    :: Breaking Benjamin - We Are Not Alone    :: The Calling&nbsp;- Camino Palmero    :: The Calling - Two    :: Steven Curtis Chapman - Speechless    :: Steven Curtis Chapman - Declaration    :: Creed - Human Clay    :: Creed - Weathered    :: Daredevil, The Album    :: Dashboard Confessional - A Mark...    :: Default - The Fallout    :: Default - Elocation    :: Earshot - Two    :: Evanescence - Fallen      :: Finch - What It Is To Burn  :: Finger Eleven - Finger Eleven &nbsp;   :: Foo Fighters - There Is Nothing Left To Lose    :: Foo Fighters - One By One    :: Fuel - Something Like Human      :: Fuel - Sunburn  :: Fuel - Natural Selection    :: Good Charlotte - The Young And The Hopeless    :: Goo Goo Dolls -&nbsp;A Boy Named Goo    :: Goo Goo Dolls - Dizzy Up The Girl    :: Guns N' Roses - Use Your Illusion &nbsp;   :: Guster - Lost And Gone Forever    :: Hoobastank - The Reason    :: Incubus - Make Yourself    :: Incubus - A Crow Left Of The Murder    :: Kutless - Kutless    :: Linkin Park - Hybrid Theory    :: Linkin Park - Reanimation    :: Linkin Park - Meteora    :: Linkin Park - Live In Texas    :: Live - Birds Of Pray    :: Lonestar - From There To Here, Greatest Hits    :: Lonestar - Let's Be Us Again    :: Lost Prophets - The Fake Sound Of Progress    :: Lost Prophets - Start Something    :: Matchbox 20 - Yourself Or Someone Like You    :: Matchbox 20 - Mad Season    :: Matchbox 20 - More Than You Think You Are    :: Matchbox 20 - EP    :: Dave Matthews - Some Devil    :: Modest Mouse - Good News For People Who Love Bad News    :: Muse - Absolution    :: New Found Glory - Catalyst    :: Nickelback - Silver Side Up &nbsp;   :: Nickelback - The Long Road    :: Pearl Jam - Vitalogy &nbsp;   :: POD - Satellite    :: Puddle Of Mud&nbsp;- Come Clean &nbsp;   :: The Punisher, The Album    :: The Rasmus - Dead Letters    :: The Red Hot Chili Peppers - Greatest Hits And Videos    ::&nbsp;The Red Hot Chili Peppers - By The Way    :: The Red Hot Chili Peppers - Californication &nbsp;   :: Relient K - Two Lefts Don't Make A Right    :: REM - In Time, 1988-2003    ::&nbsp;Revis - Places For Breathing    :: Saliva - Every Six Seconds    :: Saliva - Back Into Your System    :: Seether - Disclaimer    :: Shrek Soundtrack    :: Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese Dream &nbsp;   :: Snow Patrol - Final Straw    :: Spider-Man, Music From And Inspired By    :: Spider-Man 2, Music From And Inspired By    :: Staind - Dysfunction    ::&nbsp;Staind -&nbsp;Breaking&nbsp;The Cycle    :: Staind - 14 Shades Of Grey    :: Stone Temple Pilots - Purple &nbsp;   :: Story Of The Year - Page Avenue    :: Switchfoot - Learning To Breathe    :: Thousand Foot Krutch - Phenomenon    :: Three Days Grace - Three Days Grace    :: Trapt - Trapt    :: Unwritten Law - Elva    :: U2 - Joshua Tree    :: U2 - Achtung Baby &nbsp;   :: Velvet Revolver - Contraband    :: WoW 2000    :: The Wallflowers - Bringing Down The Horse &nbsp;   :: Yellowcard - Ocean Avenue     &nbsp;   So there you go, that's my CD collection as of July 16, 2003. As you can tell, most of it is rock...with the exception of a few country CDs thrown in there. Alli got me into that group, Lonestar. I listen to them whenever I miss her, like now, or whenever I'm feeling upset about things that are going on. But, I also listen to 'em to remind me of the great thing we have together, especially the song "Amazed" when it comes to that.     &nbsp;   Anyway...rock. A lot of the real heavy or depressing rock, I'll listen to when I'm just that...depressed. If I'm really angry about something, or really sad about something, I'll put in something I can scream to and let loose...it usually helps. But, there is some rock (usually a little on the lighter side) that I listen to when I'm in good moods too. But, all in all, I usually just listen to it because I like how it sounds.     &nbsp;   So, there ya go. I really didn't have anything to write today, so I just thought I'd get my music obsession out in the open...not that it wasn't already.

       I'm tired. I'm sad. This is my first post...wonderful way to start things out, don't ya think? I'll just kind of sum up my old blog, which I was trying&nbsp;to make on my own, and failing at doing so. (I gave up on it and decided to go for something simpler...which lead me here.)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway, in a nutshell, I talked about my current girlfriend (a lot), the beautiful and very amazing Allison. I pretty much pointed out all the good times, along with the bad. A few, of the good ones,&nbsp;to make note of here are LIPS and tour...fun stuff, and most of you reading this will know what those are...so yeah, no need to explain. And yeah, I also mentioned my friends, my family, God, my struggles and issues, things I was feeling, things I was thinking...the works. (If you really want to catch up on all of that, go to&nbsp;  urlLink http://hawkblog.vze.com . Oh, and sorry if not everything works or whatever. I kind of quit half-way through trying to fix it.)  &nbsp;  Anyway, it's 11:43, so that explains why I'm tired...that and I spent all day watching little fourth graders run around an amusement park/water park in Wisconsin, along with spending four hours on a bus next to a little, hyper kid.  &nbsp;  And sad? Well, Alli is leaving tomorrow morning...early...to head up to Canada for a week. No phone up there, no internet, no way of communicating with her at all pretty much. I'm going to miss her so much. But, I also feel bad for her...stuck up there with five movies to last her the week. (She's four hours from civilization, and all she can do, pretty much, is fish.) Hopefully I'll live; hopefully she'll live. I did, however, sign up to work all of next week...so that should keep me busy at least. And, it means I get more cash...which&nbsp;is never a bad thing. &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Well, it's almost tomorrow...so I'm going to head out. G'night, everyone.
