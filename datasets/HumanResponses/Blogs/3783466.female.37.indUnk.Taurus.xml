       urlLink I have to share this sight .  It's nothing but lost photographs people have found.  Believe me, it's a lot more interesting, and sad, and bewildering, than it sounds.  Just keep scrolling.

      So, today I was in Left Hand, West Virginia.  It's a bit off the beaten path, but the people have great gardens and I mean everybody waved at me as I drove by.  So I'm driving and I see this strange little animal bogeying down the road.  It wasn't a dog, but it was like a Bassett Hound in that it was mostly feet and no legs.  It was the furriest thing I think I've ever seen.  So I asked the woman at the Exxon gas and deli (Hunters Welcome!) what that hairy thing is that runs so fast and looks like an otter out of water.  And the woman (who also thinks that Alabama is the prettiest state, by the way) says, "Oh, that's a weasel pig."  Of course.  The weasel pigs.  Learn something new everyday.  By the by, I think  Weasel Pigs is a good name for a punk band.  Also, the woman at the Exxon gas and deli (Hunters Welcome!)says that the Amish make the best cheese.  I think it's my responsibility to pass these things along.  If you ever get to the Exxon next to Left Hand, they have great burgers.

      The vast majority of people are friendly and mean.  They like to have a cup of coffee with you and know where your from and what your daddy does.  These same friendly people also think it would be fine to get rid of fill-in-the-blank group.  Queers, drug addicts, prostitutes, Arabs, immigrants, Jews.  Whatever group they don't consider themselves to be in.  Most people would wave and cheer at the box cars full of people as it left the station.  The thing is, is that I've been letting that slide.  Somebody says something appalling and I think in my head, "Holy Christ, what a fascist!" but I don't say anything at all.  I'm going to be more objectionable.    I don't want my tombstone to say, "Here lies Jill.  She was nice."  So listen, I'll call you on your blind spots, and you call me on mine.  Deal.

      In May, I planted some snapdragon seeds in a little pot to keep in my hotel room.&nbsp; It was my first foray into the plant world.&nbsp; Previously, I had&nbsp;only watched&nbsp;plant die before my eyes (did you know that one does, in fact, have to water a cactus?).   Anyway, they out-grew the first pot, and I replanted them into two pots which was nerve- racking because I thought they could only be out of the pots for seconds before they died, so I was in a big hurry and got potting soil all over the hotel floor, and then when I thought about it later, I realized it made no sense to treat them like fish out of water.   Long story short,&nbsp;as of&nbsp;2 days ago, I have buds.&nbsp; I think they are red.&nbsp; I am proud proud proud of my snapdragons.&nbsp; I nurtured the seeds and the seeds nurtured me.&nbsp;  My snapdragons and me are blooming.

      One of my thoughts after September 11th was, "Now maybe they (conservatives) will see that we (gay people) are not the big problem facing this country."  Then, of course, Jerry Falwell said the following to Pat Robertson on the 700 Club, just a couple of days after the attacks:   I   really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way -- all of them who have tried to secularize America -- I point the finger in their face and say, "You helped this [terrorist attacks] happen . "      Falwell will say the opening prayer at the Republican National Convention next month.  If you're voting for Bush, you shouldn't in good conscience be able to look a gay person in the eye.   Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter is campaigning for him.  Her self-loathing must be horrible and his betrayal of his own flesh and blood should earn him a place in hell.

      I just returned from Homer, New York.&nbsp; I spoke with a few farmers who live there.   Do you think they are&nbsp;Homersexuals?   Actually, Homer is a great little town that 's mostly dairy and corn farms.&nbsp; Stray cats.&nbsp; Men who wear boots and women with practical haircuts.&nbsp; Kitchens that smell like biscuits and coffee.&nbsp;   My sort of place.&nbsp;   Homer, I celebrate you.   By the way, my spell checker's only alternative for "homersexual" is "immerses".&nbsp; How can that be?

      I haven't had a cigarette in a year.&nbsp; Some people say, "Oh, I quit smoking.&nbsp; I used to smoke 3 cigarettes a day."&nbsp; Cheney that.&nbsp; That's not smoking.&nbsp; That's dabbling.&nbsp; I smoked a pack and a half a day for over 15 years.&nbsp; I smoked.&nbsp; When I think about the damage I did to my body, I cringe and cower in fear of cancer.   Which brings me to cravings.&nbsp; I'm driving down the road today and I want a smoke so bad it's hard not to pull over.&nbsp; For me, it's not the romantic times that I miss cigarettes - with my coffee in the morning, or after a meal, or&nbsp;writing at my desk, &nbsp;or even out fishing.&nbsp; Those times which I associate with good times smoking aren't when I miss it.   I miss smoking when I think of something I'm ashamed of-- when I have a memory of regret or resentment.&nbsp; I miss smoking, keenly, powerfully, when I want to disappear.   Which makes sense.&nbsp; Smoking is cool because it says, "I don't care if I die."&nbsp; Smoking is like being fat in that while you may&nbsp;be bigger, because of the cloud around you or because of the larger clothes, the effect of each is that people treat you like you're smaller.&nbsp; Ignoring the smokers outside the building is like ignoring the fat girl at the dance.&nbsp; At least it feels the same.   So when I think, "Christ, I wish I hadn't said that," my&nbsp;psyche screams, "Smoke!"&nbsp; Smoke and you'll go away.   &nbsp;

      I was privileged last night to be in a group that included a man who is dying.&nbsp; I hadn't seen him in a month, and I&nbsp;didn't know&nbsp;how much damage cancer can do in that short amount of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; He must have dropped 40 pounds and he can no longer walk on his own.&nbsp; He knows he has a&nbsp;few weeks&nbsp;left.   He talked about what a beautiful day it was and how he just wanted more days.&nbsp; He's afraid of dying.&nbsp; He carries a picture of himself around in his pocket for comfort because his body has changed so much he doesn't recognize himself in the mirror, or feel like himself.   He's 40 years old.   I am so humbled by the gift of my life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;rejoice in &nbsp;my arms and my legs and my breath.&nbsp;&nbsp; I celebrate my being.   And I celebrate yours, too.

      Micro creameries.&nbsp; Little dairies which specialize in ice cream made from local dairy cows' milk.&nbsp; If we are really good, God might let us have a micro creamery in heaven.   The place I went tonight was The Hokey Pokey in Corning, NY.&nbsp; I ordered&nbsp;moose drool on a cone&nbsp;(vanilla ice cream with bits of peanut butter cup and chocolate chips).&nbsp; People, can I say how good it was ?&nbsp; How creamy? How delicious?&nbsp; How the night was just warm enough and just cool enough?&nbsp; How the kids had the happy relaxed summer look?&nbsp; How if you're wise and lucky you might stop at one of these places instead of heading straight to your destination?   Take the slow, crooked route.   It tastes better.

      So I'm at work and this woman says, "Jill!&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; I haven't seen you in a couple of years.&nbsp; How are you?"   I had been in the same room with this vaguely familiar woman, but I didn't think I knew her, because I would have remembered her.&nbsp; Her tiny face is the same size, but now,  she has the biggest lips I've ever seen .   I said, "Oh, sure.&nbsp; I didn't recognize you with your . . . hair."&nbsp; I made a sweeping gesture around my face.   Later, I'm talking with The Partner about collagen lip injections, for barring bee stings&nbsp;causing&nbsp;some bizarrely localized&nbsp;allergic reaction, that's what this woman had done.   TP says, "What  is up with that ?"   I said, "I think it has something to do with fellatio."   She said, "I think so too."   We can't think of another reason.&nbsp;&nbsp; A moment of silence for straight women who feel like they have to have doughnut lips to be attractive.  &nbsp; Amen.

      For all my trying to be positive about every place being someplace, I sure as heck am glad to be out of West Virginia.&nbsp; I'll think of some nice things about&nbsp;Wild Wonderful&nbsp;West Virginia (it's on the license plates) after I've been away for a couple of weeks or months.  &nbsp;  As I was driving up through the hills, radio stations were scarce.&nbsp; At one point, the only thing on FM was Toby Keith's "Who's Your Daddy" and the only thing on AM was Rush Limbaugh and I thought, "This car is in hell."  &nbsp;  By the way, Limbaugh was criticizing the "enemies of war."&nbsp; I think we are also known as "most people from nearly every country in the world."&nbsp; But why quibble.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      There is this vast population of the world made up of people who measure the quality of each day on whether they get dinner or they go hungry.  &nbsp;  Then, there is the population&nbsp; of people who measure the quality of each day on how good dinner is that day.  &nbsp;  Nothing is wrong and nothing is fantastic.&nbsp; Later on tonight I'll do laundry, talk to The Partner on the phone, flip through the channels, do some sit ups.  &nbsp;  Another perfectly normal day that I'll wish I had back again when I have one thousand wrinkles and my legs ache in the evenings.  &nbsp;  Last night I had good barbecue.&nbsp; Ribs so tender they fell off the bone.&nbsp; Chocolate pie with a hint of cinnamon.  &nbsp;

      Jeeze Loo-eeze,  &nbsp;  you know what I miss&nbsp;about Texas&nbsp; (other than people)?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;I know this place, The Longhorn, in Bryan, Texas, that makes the tenderest Chicken Fried Steak, and all of the waitresses are over 50 years old, and they don't even ask you what kind of dressing you want because all they have is homemade ranch, and they put bacon in the green beans, and the mashed potatoes are so fluffy that it's like having less than anything in your mouth.  &nbsp;  Do I even have to tell you about the peach cobbler?

      Just for the record, I expect to be alive for a long time&nbsp; (actually, I was looking at an actuarial table yesterday and I have 48 years left, if I'm average).  &nbsp;  But my partner and I were talking about funeral songs yesterday - what song we think sums up our life and that we want played at our memorial.  &nbsp;  Before I was the non-smoking, non-drinking, weight-lifting, treadmill-running&nbsp;woman blogging before you, my funeral song was "Losing My Religion" by REM, which my partner likes to remind me of by singing, "That's me in the corner! That's me in the spotlight!" really loudly because I'm embarrassed by my egocentric angst-filled past.  &nbsp;  Now, my song is  urlLink "I am a Town"  by Mary Chapin Carpenter.&nbsp; It's not irreverent enough, but it has the right amount of Southern Girl Lost Child in it.&nbsp; &nbsp;  I am, as always,&nbsp;open to suggestions.   Also, I want to be cremated and have myself put in lots of small containers for everyone to take home.&nbsp; Like a gift bag, but different.  &nbsp;  The Partner thinks that is weird.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Actually, that does sound weird now that I writing it.  &nbsp;  I'm still working on a plan.&nbsp; I'm fairly certain bag pipes will not be involved.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; That's what I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      You know what I hate worse than anything, besides civilian casualties of war or the fact that we don't fund schools sufficiently to have an educated populous?  Besides those things, the thing I hate worse than anything is having people I admire mad at me.  Even though it's an inevitable part of life, I swear, it just drives me up the wall.  I just report the truth here, people.

      From today's NY Times Letters to the Editor:  To the Editor:  Re "Urged by Right, Bush Takes On Gay Marriages" (front page, July 12):   President Bush and his religious conservative friends should note that our sexual orientation is far less a lifestyle choice than their belief in fundamentalist religious doctrine. The Constitution exists to protect individual rights, not to permanently enshrine the fear and ignorance of one group's morality into law.

      I was in Quiet Dell, West Virginia and I had a couple of minutes with an ol' boy.  I mentioned I was from Chicago.    He said, "Never been there.  How's Chicago?"  "Big,"  I said.  "How's West Virginia?"  "Slow," he answered.  Then, we sat with our coffee and didn't say anymore because, really, that's enough.

      There's an article in the  urlLink NY Times Magazine  about a woman who sells sex toys at home-parties in rural Arkansas. (sort of like Tupperware parties, but different).  According to the article:  " She prefers not to say the word ''clitoris,'' but rather uses a euphemism: ''the little man in the boat .'"  That might be the funniest thing, ever.

      I used to think hotels were romantic.  Not in a rendezvous/tryst sort of way, but in a "I'm the traveling kind" lone-wolf sort of way.  I've lived in a hotel for a month now, and this isn't the first time I've done that.  It's not romantic.  It's isolating and weird.  I am a herd animal.  Even as an introvert, I find the long hallway with closed doors on each side depressing.  I'm ashamed at having a maid look at my mess and clean my toilet while I'm working at my laptop, so I try to make small talk.  I don't know if that helps or not.  I like the privacy.  I like the cable tv.  I don't like the hotel smell.    And I miss home.  I miss my partner.  I miss my dogs.    Damn.  I nearly miss law school.

Also, I found out my great, great grandmother, Amanda Bland, born in 1852, gave birth to 15 children and had 61 grandchildren and 22 great grandchildren when she died in 1924 in New Martinsville, West Virginia.  You Go, Grandma Bland. I celebrate you.  God, you must have been tired a lot.

It started a month ago on my drive to my summer job, and now I'm convinced that working in the oil and gas industry makes me break out in weird symptoms.  A couple of summers ago I had the same job and I got a bizarre fever every afternoon.  My body wants me in public service and my wallet wants me working for The Man.

      The Blue Ridge Mountains, are, in fact, blue on days like this.  Sunny and hazy at the same time.  At sunset, they turn purple.  In Southern NY, some of the leaves are already starting to turn yellow and red.  Mostly the ones that line the road.  I don't know why those leaves turn first.

      You know that hopeful theme that runs through the American ideology, the one that says if you try your hardest, really apply yourself, you'll be successful?  You know that cornerstone of the American Dream?  I have a new theme in my life this year.  A montage, if you will.  It's this: if I try my hardest, and really apply myself, I'm just below average.  I'm not talking about self-pity, I'm talking about a bell curve in work and school.  So I'm trying to extract Lessons of Life from my experience.  These are the first lessons that come to mind:  1) Everyone is smarter than me.  2) Humility is something I guess I don't have enough of, according to God.  I know these lessons are not rational.  My partner says the lesson is I Can't Think Myself About of Everything.  Honestly, I'm giving that one some thought.  To comfort myself, I remind myself there are two things I do well above average 1) Make banana bread  2)Comment on the symbolism in William Goldings, Lord of the Flies.  So I have that going for me.    Actually, I had this spiritually revelation about a year ago and it was this:  My job is to be the best Jill I can be.  That's always the lesson.  The more I think on it, the deeper that lesson goes.

      I just cannot get over  urlLink this story .  Ms. Grind spent over 2 years on her couch. Her skin grew into the couch and she was found lying in filth. She weighed 400 pounds. She died a couple of hours after they got her to the hospital.  Her neighbor said that Ms. Grind was a grown woman and could make up her own mind about getting off the couch and if she didn't want to move, then that was her decision.  For the love of God.   We are our brother's keeper . Either we do the best we can at it, or we suck at it, but we depend on one another. When your neighbor can't get off the couch so bad that you can smell the apartment from the street, then call the police, you callous idiot.  Jeeze.  Of course we are our brother's keeper.

      We drove through the Red States yesterday, Chicago to OKC, sans rainbow sticker (see below) so the drive was blessedly uneventful and long. Previously, the rainbow sticker caused the most flack in Missouri, a state in which I will not be living.  Yesterday, I got a form in the mail that will allow me to be an attorney's representative and enter the federal prisons. I'm doing a criminal defense clinic next semester. Thank God. Maybe I'll be good at it. I need to find my nitche soon to boost my law school esteem, which right now, is negligible.  I'm taking advantage of OKC by eating chicken fried steak. I brought my pots of snapdragons to soak up the sun. It's a week between work and school, and Lord, I'm grateful.

      I think I might have  urlLink Rosacea , this skin disease that can make my nose "bulbous". I do not want a bulbous nose. (If you, reader, have a bulbous nose, please know that I have nothing against you personally, and I'm sure you look great - it's my hang up, the whole bulbous thing)  Monday, my partner and I are driving from Cleveland to OK City in our mini van, her regular car. She has a rainbow sticker on it, and more than once, she's gotten harassed because of the sticker (cars honking, obscene gestures, etc.).  The long and short of it is that I asked her to take off the sticker for the long drive.  TP feels like taking off the rainbow is giving in to the trashy ignorant pricks who harass us.  Even if that's true,  I don't like  being harassed by trashy ignorant pricks. Plus, one of the consequences of being a minority is that the one of us represents all of us. So if I get out of the rainbowed van looking like I've been in the car for 12 hours, then I feel like everyone at the gas station who sees me is thinking, "All lesbians look tired like that one over there that just got out of that mini van." The whole thing is very stressful. I can't shoulder the responsibility.

      I don't get why Governor McGreevey had to quit.  His affair was wrong, but being unfaithful has never been a bar to political life.   Is he trying to send the message that he can't be gay and a governor?  Even Rick Perry knows that's not true.  In other news, I was in a itty bitty town in way upstate New York today, and I drove past a handwritten sign that said, "Worms $1 a Dozen" with an arrow pointing to a little house, and I found great comfort in that.  If things go to hell, I can sell worms.  My other back up plan is to sell funnel cakes at festivals.   I don't like crowds, though, and I think I'd rather sell worms, but it's good to have two Plan Bs.  I have to leave NY in two days to go to Oklahoma for a week and then back to law school in Chicago.  I'm dreading school.  I'm not failing, but the whole process has me feeling like a failure.

      1968. John Kerry was somewhere near, but not in, Cambodia, and George Bush was drinking beer in Alabama.  I was but a young Jill, not having yet grown knee caps, and still having a soft spot in my head that my brother could put his finger through whenever he wanted. (as he was wont to remind me)  I remember finding out about Vietnam around 1977 and I asked my stepmother, "Do you mean there was a war and no one told me about it?" and she said, "Yes." That made me wonder what else had gone on that I didn't know about (turns out there was a sexual revolution that happened in places not called Midland or anywhere around West Texas).  All in all 1968 was a good year for me. I was nurtured but not nursed, changed and was changed, spit up and slept a lot. It was a better year than Kerry had, wherever he was.

      So I say, "Bob," (this is the same Bob who likes Alan Keyes, see below) "If you were a bread, what type of bread would you be?"  I can tell by his look that this is the first time he's been asked this question.  Bob says, "Rye."  And I say, "Why Rye, Bob?"  And Bob says, "Because I like rye bread."  You simply can't argue with that.  By the way, The Partner would be a Parisian French Baggett because, she says, they are held under the arms of bicyclers.

      Not only do I get to vote for Barak Obama again, but I also get to vote against Alan Keyes.  There's joy in my bleeding heart.  I was at work today and this guy says, "You know who I like? The new guy running in Illinois."  I said, "Bob, you're a crazy man, but not as crazy as Alan Keyes who says a victory for him is a victory for God."  There's a certain percentage of voters out there who think that Jesus will return next year speaking English, voting Republican, and driving an SUV.  I'm just saying I think the odds of that are rather low.

      Since I decided that North Dakotans have the personality of flat bread (see below) I asked myself, "Jill, if you were a bread, what bread would you be?"  I answered, "Jill, I'd say you are self-rising yeast rolls."  Self-rising yeast rolls are independent (doing the rising by themselves), unpredictable, fresh, tasty, toasty, and easily divisible (but not sliced).  Plus, that I should fit into a dozen different cups feels right to me.  If you would like to fill the comments section with what kind of bread you would be, that would be glorious.

      I've never met a Mormon I didn't like. I'm sure there are thousands of irritating Mormons out there, but all the Mormons I know have been kind and smart.  I was reminded of this today because I was thinking about stereotypes. Hell, I'll just say it: Every person I've met from North Dakota has had the personality of a piece of flat bread. Not bad personalities. Just not any zing. Practical people, not given to imbibe in the social lubricant of uncalled for friendliness.  I've never met a North Dakota Mormon either.  Speaking of stereotypes, an attorney hung up on me today for no reason other than he could. What. An. Ass.  In two years, when I am a rich and famous attorney, I will not hang up on the little people.  (kidding, kidding)

      I've been stressed and tired, so I've been quiet. After work, I haven't even wanted to answer the phone, and I haven't gone to pick up my snapdragons that a friend is flower sitting for me.  While I'm recharging, I thought I'd share this quote because it's one of my favorites and I've been thinking about it a lot lately. It's Eugene Debs' statement to the court.   Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free .   urlLink The whole thing is here.

      My partner is preaching in Cleveland (which, in fact, rocks), and I went to hear her sermon this morning. She introduced me during the service. She is fantastic and brilliant.  Her sermon was on translation, and part of it concerned what it means to be understood, personally. There is a  urlLink line in the prayer  of St. Francis of Assisi that says, may I seek to "understand rather than to be understood."  When I was more of an  urlLink Objectivist , I thought the prayer was a good example of how Christianity made being subservient and meek ideal virtues so that the powerful could control and manipulate the masses. (What kind of world would we have if religion said, "do what makes you happy and fulfilled"? A better world than we have now, I think.)  Anyway, I know it's important to be heard and sometimes I need to shout. Sometimes I need to sit quietly. Sometimes I need to listen, and sometimes the person talking is such a  urlLink hateful  dumb  urlLink ass  that it's not worth listening to.  Which  is  more important, to understand or to be understood?  I don't know.
