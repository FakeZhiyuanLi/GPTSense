      Well, my sister had a beautiful, BEAUTIFUL baby girl this morning at 7:21 am, and i love her so much. I dont want to sound like im not glad or anything, but my sister is only 19 years old, and hasnt even been to college, has no job, and her "boyfriend", or whatever you want to call him *we all hate him*, had no job, and is starting school this monday. He hasnt had a job for like three months and my sister has been supporting his lazy @ss for the whole time she has been pregnant and on her own, since she gets help.  She doesnt want to move home and let my mom help or I, but she loves the freedom of living on her own, and "supporting herself", i just wanted to yell at her today and say "You love supporting yourseslf, it's kinda hard to support yourself when you get help from the gov. b/c you're pregnant, have no job, and your boyfriend doesnt either, and your mother is still supporting you too, since you are nineteen, and she has to take care of you until you are 21."  It just bothers me so much, she is nineteen years olf and is wasting her life with a guy that doesnt appreciate her, and the only reason she is staying with him is b/c he's the father of "her" child.  The way he acts, it seems like he doesnt even want the baby, i think he needs to grow up.  Im afraid for her, and her baby, i dont want my neice to end up like her father, or mother, i hate to say it, but it's true. My sister could've gotten someone alot better, and that would treat her alot better, but she had to choose him. I dont want to end up like my sister, or my mother, they chose their road in life and that is not one i want to travel. I dont want to have a baby when im 18 or 19 and have no way to support it, and then have it have a dead beat dad. My dad was a dead beat, always druck always in jail, never cared a thing about us. I never new my dad at all, he left when my brother and i were 9 months old, and never came back. I did finally get to see him though, it the coffin they were burying him in, never really felt anything on that day. Well enough of that, i hate, well i guess, it's my past, and my future. I hope i can make it far away from here, i hope so much.

      K8erz28: update your blog you poop heavenly0587: no heavenly0587: you update my blog K8erz28: give me your password K8erz28: and don't tell me it's 12345  ^^Recent AIM convo^^  So it turns out, less than 1 week after our dear Heavenly made her first blog, she is too lazy to update it.  That's where I come in.  See, my ambition is so great that I can manage to update other people's blogs as well as my own.  I rule.  Not really.  I just don't have anything else to do.  Sooo..yeah.  I guess I'll tell you a little bit about Heaven.  She likes reg-GAY music.  She writes poetry sometimes.  She's tall.  She's good at art, unlike me, because cool people aren't artsy fartsy like Heavenly.  Just kidding.  She loves hamburger meat.  She thinks vegetarian hippie treehuggers are stupid.  She often refers to me as "gay", "fag", or "crystal clear" (hence my blog address, which she reluctantly decided to NOT include in her blog).  She likes those scruffy long haired haven't-showered-in-a-week kind of guys.  Oh, did I mention she loves meat?  Medium rare steak covered with mushrooms and onions is her favorite dish.
