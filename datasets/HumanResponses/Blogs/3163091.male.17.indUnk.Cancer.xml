      Ok, by popular demand i am being forced by the powers that be to make another entry in this journal. ok form what i understand the who thing with Dustin and Shelia was succsesful as the movie Gilli (its alright D just keep on tryin , anyway ITS ALL PLATNIUM). Saturday i saw man on fire w/ Denzel WAshington, that shit is better than training day. Denzel is one bad muthafuka. my favorite line: "Last wish? I wish....U had...More time."  anyway go see that shit. so now for the question of the day?  Would you rather take one punch from Mike Tyson in the face?  or  Would u get kicked in the  by Bruce Lee    well nothin much really happened this week except hear shit throught the grape vine  oh, dustin and vito i really think that that thing that trade u guys were think'in bout doin would be a good idea especially for Dustin

      Sing along with the theme song! Ride on the Magic School Bus  Cruisin' on down Main Street You're relaxed and feelin' good  Next thing that you know you're seein' Octopus in the neighborhood!  Surfin' on a sound wave  Swingin' through the stars Take a left at your intestine Take your second right past Mars.  On THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS Navigate a nostril Climb on THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS Spank a plankton, too On our Magic School Bus  Raft a river of lava On THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS Such a fine thing to do!  So strap your bones right to the seat Come on in and don't be shy — Just to make your day complete You might get baked into a pie  On THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS... Step inside — it's a wilder ride! Come on — ride on THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS!  .......Abe  Ok im starting to hear bit and pieces of wha happened at Detroit, and first of all eli im sorry kid  well since this is only 6th period and im gonna leave u w/ the best line ever in the history of time lets see who can guess where its from and who said it:  Jules: You read the Bible?    Ringo: Not regularly.   Jules: There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you." I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker before you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin': it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or it could be you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin, Ringo. I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd.   ok im out, 4 days till ACEN muthafukas HA HA HA.....Bitches
