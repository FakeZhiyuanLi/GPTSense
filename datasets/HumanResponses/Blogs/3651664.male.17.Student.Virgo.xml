      Kerry  urlLink criticized  President Bush's tax cuts again yesterday, saying that the top one percent of income earners have benefited the most from his tax cuts, and that the tax burden is beginning to shift to the middle class. Quick, go get some Socialism in a Can! We have to fix this horrible atrocity!  Oh wait, this is a good thing.  The top 5% of taxpayers in this country  urlLink pay more than half  (53%) of all income taxes. The top 1% pay 30% of income taxes. How can this be fair? These are the people who pump money back into the economy and create new jobs. These are the people to have worked the hardest to succeed, and the government is punishing them.  So while the top 5% of taxpayers are paying the most taxes, the bottom 35% of income earners  urlLink pay ZERO income taxes . That's right. Zero. And yet, they collect tax returns on taxes they don't pay.  So why is it unfair that the 95% of people who PAY taxes have the largest tax burden?  You're right. It's not.

      I had an argument with someone today about the Iraq war. I have these arguments about twice a week. This one today, however, completely pissed me off. The kid I was arguing with brought up the whole "Bush Lied" spiel again. And again, I patiently explained how the CIA gets tips from sources, then they try to corroborate the information, then they analyze this information, and then they give it to the President. The President decides if the information needs to be acted upon. I think that anyone who is told, "This crazed genocidal dictator is building banned weapons" would act upon this information. Even John Kerry said last week that knowing no WMD's would be found, he would have authorized force (I already commented on this). The kid still won't cave. So I bring up the fact that mass graves were one of the first things that American troops found when entering Iraq, and that Saddam tried to wipe out the entire Kurdish population of Iraq with chemical weapons. These are documented facts. How can you not care about this kind of thing? Well, this kid didn't think it was important. Even when I brought up the similarities with Hitler's Holocaust, he wouldn't agree that it was right. And last, I pulled out the UN Oil for Food scandal under which Saddam stole  urlLink $10 billion  from his own citizens. Still nothing. How can someone not care about these things? How many reasons does someone need to have an evil dictator removed from power? Liberalism is going to KILL this nation.  UPDATE: Another reason for our involvement in Iraq: Iraqi athletes can participate in the Olympics without fear of being tortured by Uday if they fail. Seeing them in the Opening Ceremonies is truly moving.

      Was John Kerry in Cambodia on Christmas Eve '68? Well, he says he was, but apparently he's changed his mind again. His biographer, Douglas Brinkley, who has access to his personal journals, says he was simply  urlLink "mistaken."  He was fifty miles from Cambodia on Christmas Eve. Whoops. So he's in Vietnam for four months, doesn't even finish his first tour, and wants to be elected based on his "experience."  Some interesting facts about Kerry and Vietnam: All three of his Purple Heart awards were for wounds that required a band-aid; He carried a typewriter and movie camera with him to Vietnam to document his exploits and re-enact war scenes for his political career; His photograph is hanging in a place of honor in a communist Vietnamese museum in Saigon; Captured Americans were tortured in North Vietnamese prisons for not endorsing his false testimony before the US Senate about alleged war crimes.  That's just a few. To learn the whole truth about John Kerry and Vietnam, read the book  urlLink "Unfit for Command"  by John O'Neill and Jerome Corsi when it comes out on the 15th.  Thanks to Sean for the tip.

      New Jersey Governor James McGreevey, resigned  urlLink resigned  today after he admitted that he had a homosexual affair. Which is kind of ironic, considering he said earlier this year that he opposed gay marriage. The only unfortunate part of this is that the man who will succeed him, State Senate President Richard Codey, is also a Democrat.

      John Kerry pledged last week to wage a  urlLink more "sensitive" war on terror . He also thinks we should to try not to offend our friends and allies (read: France and Germany) in our quest to rid the world of stupid morons. So these people fly two airplanes into skyscrapers, killing 3,000 people, behead American citizens, and terrorize a goverment into submission (Spain), and we should be more sensitive in the way we take care of them. And how DARE we offend Old Europe in the process of defending our national security?! I don't think this man UNDERSTANDS national security.

      The People's Republic of California seems to be drifting towards the right side these days. First we find out that Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has a  urlLink 65% approval rating , and today the California Supreme Court annulled more than  urlLink 4,000 gay marriages  in San Francisco, saying that the city government improperly granted the marriage licenses for the homosexuals. Hopefully this trend will continue, and California will throw out Nancy Pelosi in November. Now THAT would be a victory.

      Today John Kerry  urlLink criticized President Bush  for not allowing cheap medicine to be imported from Canada. Kerry also pledged to never privatize Social Security, cut retirement benefits, or raise the retirement age. So basically, his plan is to screw over young Americans and kill the innovation of new medicines. Young people who pay money every month into Social Security will never see that money again because the seniors are using it up so rapidly. But who cares? They're just the future of America. The old ones that are about to die are  much  more important. And importing cheap Canadian medicine? The medicine from Canada is only cheap because the Socialistic Canadian government aritificially holds down the price. This means that the companies that create the drugs don't get compensated enough for the 15-year process they go through to bring a new drug to market, so they don't have enough money to turn around and invent new medicines. Let in Canadian medicine, and the prescription drug industry will go down the tubes.

      So R&B and Rap artists Babyface, Brandy, Ashanti, Jadakiss, Mary J Blige, Missy Elliot, and Eve are  urlLink re-recording a version of the 1960's song "Wake Up Everybody"  to push people to vote for John Kerry in November. This song has been used many times by the Democrats, including during the 1976 election to push black voters to vote for Jimmy Carter. Doesn't this say anything about the man they want elected? Do they really want another Jimmy Carter for president? Heck, the Democrats didn't let Carter anywhere near a DNC stage for 20 years because he was such an embarassment. The only reason he was back this year is that a lot of today's voters weren't around to see what an embarassment he was. Perhaps these people should have stayed in school, gone to college, and gotten a real job. Then they'd understand how ignorant they really are.

      One of John Kerry's big positions is his belief that he can make the US "respected in the world." He claims that he will win back friends and allies that President Bush has alienated. Well, I'd think that any country would like us more if our foreign policy became "bend over." Now Kerry's  urlLink claiming  that he'll be able to get more countries to send troops to the Middle East to relieve American troops. Load of crap -- the Old European nations like Germany and France never WANTED to send troops to Iraq. Why would they now? And why isn't anyone mentioning the "Coalition of the Willing" -- the nations that sent troops to Iraq. This "Coalition" includes the  urlLink majority of Europe . But apparently the only "friends and allies" that matter to the Democrats are Kofi Annan, Germany, and France. And what's this crap still coming up about our withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaties? As I recall, those treaties were signed with the Soviet Union. Who can find the Soviet Union on the map? That's because it DOESN'T EXIST anymore.

      Just thought I'd throw in that Donald Trump, the idiot that said he'd  urlLink fire George Bush  over the Iraq war, isn't quite as well off as he is being portrayed on his reality show "The Apprentice" and his TV commercials. Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts will enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy next month, and Trump himself will lose his majority stake in the company. What a moron. Haha.  UPDATE: They're also taking away his CEO position. Donald Trump,  urlLink you're fired!

      Alan Keyes is starting his campaign for the Illinois senate seat with a bang. He has called Democratic rival Barack Obama's views on abortion the  urlLink "slaveholder's" view.  He said that Obama's vote against a bill that would have outlawed late-term abortions violates the rights of the unborn. This man is a pioneer. Back before the Civil War, the opinion of the white male slaveholders towards their slaves was that they were nothing more than property -- and that the slaveholder should be able to treat his slaves however he wants. This is the Democratic position towards abortion. So an irresponsible 17-year-old girl gets pregnant, but the child that is the result of her irresponsibility is worth nothing -- it's just the girl's property. Now Keyes, instead of demanding reparations for the treatment that his ancestors suffered, has turned around and tried to get unborn children the same equal rights that his people fought for. What a great man. Barack Obama's response? He suggests that Keyes is outside the moderate mainstream of state Republicans. The same man that stood up in the Democratic National Convention and told the American people to vote for John Kerry -- the most liberal member of the Senate -- is saying that Keyes isn't right for the senate seat because he is too conservative. Hmm...

      First post!  Now, I know that a lot of you Democrats out there are against the war in Iraq. Bush lied, war is bad, etc. So, your alternative is to turn around and vote for John Kerry -- a liberal who, if only on certain days of the week, has portrayed himself as against the Iraq war (remember his DNC speech?  urlLink Refresh your memory  ). Now he's come out and said that, even knowing that no WMD's would be found, he would still have voted to give Bush the authority to use force against Iraq (  urlLink From Reuters  ). Make much sense? Didn't think so.  There's a new documentary out, funded by the RNC, all about Kerry's conflicting statements on Iraq. Apparently, it's already surpassed Fahrenheit 911's opening weekend viewership. Rudy Giuliani, the 9/11 hero, has been quoted saying, "Every American Should See This." So go see it:  urlLink www.kerryoniraq.com   Have a great day.
