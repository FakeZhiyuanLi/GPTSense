      I swear that I am not. However, today has brought me two unfortunate incidents of my own creation that are decidedly  klutzy .  Today, I began my trip to New Orleans by way of Shreveport. Wow, it was a scorcher in Dallas. So I stopped to get myself a delicious icy smoothie from Smoothie King.  Cranberry Supreme, I'm a slave 4 U. Then I aired up my front tires at the gas station, which scored me a mystery cut on my finger. That's not the klutzy part.  I was on 75 just getting warmed up, when I decided to replace Turin Brakes with Grandaddy. Those are bands. So I put my smoothie in my lap, grabbed my gigantic CD binder, and hefted it onto the steering wheel. What I didn't see was that I had slammed the book down onto my smoothie straw, and the straw plowed through the bottom of my smoothie cup. It took several seconds for me to realize what had happened. Of course, during those rare occasions when you accidentally get  ice in your underwear , you become quite indignant as soon as you notice. So I figured out what happened, but I couldn't really do much about it. A lot of smoothie had already leaked into my lap, and I was wearing short shorts. There was a hole at the bottom of the cup, and of course there was a hole at the top (where the straw was). Consequently, I couldn't just lose the smoothie. There was really no safe way to get rid of it.  I had to actually coax the smoothie into being absorbed by my shorts, 'cause better my shorts than my car upholstery. Oh, did I mention that this was right in the middle of the 635 interchange? Yeah I was on a ramp. With lots of construction. And absolutely no shoulder space. So I had to sit with cranberry puree and melting ice and " turbinado !" seeping through my undies. Then I pulled over at a Racetrak, and I had to do the Walk o' Shame into the gas station with a big wet dark purplish red stain on my crotch.   I think I read about this in Seventeen once.  Anyway, changed, cursed, cleaned, got back on my way.   Later, once I arrived in Shreveport, I headed to the Mudbug Madness festival with my mom. We ate crawfish and "ya-ya yams," gawked at the  fried Twinkie  booth, and watched a really talented 13-year old Cajun fiddler and singer named Amanda Shaw. Wow, she was fabulous. Star quality, there. Later, I met up with my dad, who offered me a lot of free booze (which I declined). He was working at the beer booth. I guess being bartender for a day means that you have to swill beer for free just like any self-respecting bartender. My dad is somewhat uptight, so it was...quaint...to see him acting obnoxious and repeating himself.   urlLink    Dad and me.&nbsp; urlLink     He had promised to bring some crawfish home for my stepmom, so I bought some and we walked out to the car. While trying to rearrange the backseat of his truck, I tilted the box of crawfish up a little and...oops. Bloody hell, I have mudbug juice in my lap.   Mudbug juice is a mix of water, the blackest muck from the Mississippi Delta, those lovely pungent Cajun spices, and salt. Oh, and also the natural liquids of crawfish that have been boiled alive. It has the trait of being both knock-you-over fishy-smelling and resilient. So on the thirty minute drive home, I had to steep in my mudbug juice and smell my vile-smelling self. Crawfish is, hands down, the primary reason that New Orleans stinks like  flaming rot . People say it's all the drunkards, but I don't think so. I mean, if that were the case then family reunion time at the Kennedy complex would be a notorious reekfest.   urlLink    Mmm...edible arachnids.&nbsp; urlLink     The good news is that I got officialy hit-on for the first time in my new glasses. A cute but probably drunk guy at the festival looked me over and slurred, "Hel-lo there!..how ya doin'?" Aw, cute drunk likes the bookish type. I'm flattered.  And now, time to wash away the sticky and the stinky.   Are you kidding? I'm not that devoted a blogger. When we got home, I showered first thing. I smell like a rose, baby.

      In preparation for my move, I have been getting all my medical issues out of the way. For instance, today I had my first eye exam ever and now I own two pairs of  glasses ! They are very cute. I will put up some pics of my new look as soon as I find someone willing to take some glamourshots. Last week, I had a physical. Next week, I will be seeing the dentist and a psychiatrist. Yep. Has it really come to this, you ask? Indeed it has.   Some of you who know me may be wondering what on earth I would need psychiatric care for.  Well, if you were ever in a relationship with me, you would know. If we are just friends, or we just had those two awful dates that spelled doom for us, count yourself  lucky . If you're a stranger, I don't know if you're lucky or not. It depends...do you like cynical sarcastic types? Anyway, I'll just say that I have been in a lot of emotional pain for a long time, and therapy wasn't fixing it (although it was nice to be able to   name   my issues for a change).  Also, my degree was in psychology. I think that officially makes me a joke.  As for the dentist, I have been advised to handle my dental matters stateside. I guess the teeth situation in Japan is something akin to the purported British situation. Not that I am slamming the dentistry of either nations. I've never been to Great Britain, and in Japan I was too blinded by  glittery eyeshadow  and hot-orange hair streaks to really notice the young people's teeth.  I am going to New Orleans this weekend for a little vacation. It's  crawfish season  and I am young, willing, and eager. Or as Hunter S. Thompson might say, "I feel a powerful lust for mudbugs." I can almost smell that intoxicating stench...

      Ahhh, a blog.  I've definitely made it now.  I feel so 2002.   urlLink    Someone forgot to bring her spirit fingers.&nbsp; urlLink     I have finally-  finally! - graduated from college, and I have accepted a teaching position with the  urlLink  JET Programme. That's this thing where the Japanese government hires fluent Japanese-speakers who are certified to teach English, and sends them to Japan. Except for the speaking Japanese part...you don't have to know a word of it. Oh, and the certified teacher part...they really don't care what you majored in.  Double-major in biochem and electrical engineering? Come on down!  We've got a pair of chopsticks with your name on it!  So, I am moving to  Iwakuni , Japan, at the end of July. Iwakuni is this tiny little town where I lived for a while when I was a kid. I requested it because I have family there, and by god, I got it. This would be like someone doing an exchange program to the U.S. and asking, "Um, I would really really like it if I could please, just maybe, move to Atlanta! No, not Atlanta, Georgia.  Atlanta, Texas. Right there. You think I could? The waiting list isn't too long or anything? Oh, good."   urlLink    Iwakuni as seen from Iwakuni Castle&nbsp; urlLink     Yes, I got Iwakuni, presumably because everyone else asked for Tokyo, or a suburb of Tokyo, or a town within commuting distance to Tokyo, or maybe Okinawa instead. Iwakuni has a  Marine Corps  base, which is quite the dubious distinction.    Right now I am excited and packing and worrying about FOOD. I love Japanese food (except for raw crab legs, which I have not tried but I have had the privilege of being seated beside at a restaurant). However, I'm worried about the lack of diverse foodstuffs in my little town.  Avocados , for instance. Last time I had an avocado in Japan, it was so hard that I had to use a carpenter's chisel to hew off little chunks of it. That avocado was...well, whatever the word is for "the opposite of satiny buttery goodness." And I've never seen a mango there. I don't think I've seen cupcakes, dill pickles, granola, or salsa either. They do like donuts. I like donuts too.    I am just wondering how my cooking skills will suffer in another country.  I made some chocolate chip cookies in Japan once, and they were abysmal.  And why?  The chocolate chips in Japan are  different . I don't know how they are different, but they are. The milk is different too, and so are the eggs. I'm going to try to make a tres leches cake and end up with a sticky flotation device. And then Japan will collectively laugh at me. Foolish roundeye, thinking she can cook!  Well, time to make some lunch.

      All right, it's less than a month until I move to Japan and some of my apprehensions and fears are starting to coalesce.  When I drove down to Houston for my JET interview, I got to sit in a room with some of the other applicants. I noticed that I didn't feel like I would fit in with most of them. I don't really know why, but I guess it was probably a lot of my personal  stereotyping  rather than their shortcomings. I think that I am going into JET with a lot of stereotypes that, consequently, make me quite nervous.  There's the anime-freaks and the J-pop devotees (that's Japanese pop music, a sinfully saccharine strain of the music landscape). For some reason, I get vaguely irritated by Americans who embrace certain aspects of Japanese culture. I can't explain it very eloquently (at least, not without sounding like a snob), but I can only suggest that it might be akin to how I've heard some black people feel about white people embracing superficial aspects of black culture. Here's my take: it's not wrong, and in a sense it is encouraging and kinda "one world," " let's diversify " and all that. But at the same time, something about it...the picking and choosing of "cool" parts of the culture and glorifying it, without really experiencing the culture firsthand (by traveling or learning a language or something)...it just rubs me the wrong way. And I know it's judgmental and hypocritical of me. After all, I think Japanese incense is the coolest thing ever but I've never researched the art. I love my Japanese food but can't be bothered to learn how to cook it (yet!). I don't know. It just raises a red flag for me when I meet someone who thinks manga/samurai legend/anime/-insert trendy Japanese subculture- is JUST! SO! COOL!  See? I sound like a snob.  To add to the snobbery, I am also not looking forward to the prospect of hanging out with a bunch of college kids during my three-day orientation in Tokyo. Granted, we're all college graduates, but let's face it: most of us are twentysomethings on the earlier side of the decade. I've never been quite at home with going out and boozing it up, and I'm worried that I'll have my potential friends whittled down to a prudish few because of that. Don't get me wrong; I've been known to get decked out and cause a  moderate ruckus  out and about, every now and again. But this is definitely the exception for me, and it's an increasingly rare one. I'd rather get to know people by talking to them sober, not by getting tipsy and letting inhibitions slip. I can mingle and stuff, but it's an effort for me. I like one-on-one conversations and finding common interests or debating differences in opinion. I'm just hoping that once I meet my group, every night won't be about finding cheap places to drink in Shinjuku, or hitting the clubs after our welcome reception, or getting loaded downstairs at the hotel bar and gawking at all the bad karaoke.  And finally, some totally-justified criticism. I visited BigDaikon.com for the first time today. It's a site for JETs and pretty much anyone affiliated (prospective JETs, alumni JETs). There are many such sites, but this one seems particularly no-holds-barred, which is refreshing. However, there seems to be an ongoing feud between a)JET males who, regardless of how  unattractive, nerdy, or loserly  they were back home, are reaping massive amounts of attention (and a lot more) from enthralled Japanese girls (dubbed the "zero to hero phenomenon"), and b)JET females who are labeled as "jealous" and "bitter" about these toolish guys exploiting their new command over women. That's the issue in a nutshell, but it's very complicated. Some guys aren't being tools of course. Some guys are being tools, but no more so than they were back home. Some women are jealous. Some women don't give a rat's ass. But there are  definitely  some guys who are unworthy of any woman's attention, but the mere fact that they are foreign ensures that they will be able to enjoy and possibly exploit a steady supply of Japanese girls.  Yes, this bothers me. Am I jealous of the guys? Am I jealous of the Japanese girls? Do I feel threatened by them? Am I bitter that we, the foreign females, no longer wield the power of cornering the market, women-wise? Oh, I don't know. I'll go ahead and admit that it might be a little of all that. But most of it is simply witnessing the loathsome and unrepresentative behavior of a few guys. It disgusts me to think that some guys would gleefully take advantage of their situation by collecting as many  bedpost notches  as possible in Japan, knowing full well that they are coasting on a manufactured image that never would have worked back home. It's particularly disturbing to read the flippant comments made by some guys about what things (either ridiculous or lewd) they can get away with saying to a Japanese girl because she doesn't understand English.  Then again, there are jerks everywhere. I don't get too bent out of shape about how some guys act here in Texas; I shouldn't waste too much thought on what JETs are going to be doing. And I must also consider the possibility that the Japanese women are the ones doing the exploiting. After all, the foreign guys are often just seen as arm candy and  status symbols  for the Japanese chicks. Oh, it's a mad world.  Last but not least: I am NOT looking forward to going through "Japan orientation" type seminars involving how to bow, when to take your shoes off, what to do at a Japanese dinner, and nonsense like that. Been there, done that. Now this may sound like more snobbery, but come on...how would you feel if you were a computer programmer and you had to take  Intro to Typing ? Or if you took ten years of piano lessons and someone bought you a book on how to read sheet music? I'm not an expert on Japanese culture, not by a long shot. But I do think it's okay to say that "learning" the basics during orientation will be rather dull for me.  Seriously. Someone tried to convince me last year that  Jackie Chan  was Japanese. Because I wouldn't know. As a half-Japanese person. Or for that matter, as an American. Well, he's NOT.

      Guess what?! I'm gonna make $250 for drinking beer!  That's the glorious thing about living on a college campus. There are ads all over campus that advertise various dodgy ways of making some bank. I could sell my eggs, or shill  steak knives  door-to-door, or stuff envelopes in my own home. But this is by far the best offer I've come across yet.  Yesterday, I was at the campus bookstore with my coworkers Kristen and Frances. I spotted a flyer hanging out of the UTD newspaper rack, and it verily screamed, "Drink Beer, Make $250!" Now, I've heard stories about Frances, and these stories often involved beer. So I passed the flyer on to her first. Yet my curiosity got the best of me while hers stagnated, so I went ahead and called the number myself. Ten minutes and several questions about  beer commercials  later, I was enrolled. By the way, my favorite part of the interview was when he asked me how many beers I drank in a typical week, I answered, "Uhhh...none?" and he said, "All righty, I'll just circle 'four' right here then."  You see, I HATE beer. I will somewhat voluntarily sip on  oatmeal stout  or  pear ale , but other than that I am totally not there. In fact, if you ever see me swilling beer, it's a reliable sign that I am utterly plastered, and you should keep your distance as I will probably be tossing cookies soon. In fact, I wish I had been able to warn others with this handy rule of thumb in the past. Truthfully, I have only been drunk enough to start carrying on with beer twice, much to my chagrin both times.  Therefore, I found it dreadfully amusing today when they handed me a big honking tumbler-full of beer and asked me for my written opinion on it. Twice. I even giggled to myself in my little semi-isolated semi-booth. They expect me to drink two cups of this stuff? Ughhh. And I have to come back and do this six more times. But $250 is  $250 , and split seven ways that equals $37 an hour, and I've got a vacation coming up and it would be nice to have a little extra to toss around for that.  So Angela the beer hater is gonna be drinking beer all week long. At least I don't have to finish all the beer. They said I could drink as little as I wanted, as long as I drank enough to form an opinion about the magnitude of the brown color, the yellow color, the clearness, the cloudiness, the appearance of carbonation, the mouthfeel of carbonation, the sweetness, the fruitiness, the sourness, the bitterness, the skunkiness, etc. etc. Maybe I'll become a  beer aficionado . Doubt it. Beer is gross. At least I am giving them my honest opinion of their repulsive product.   In short, hooray for college and these last few twilight moments as a student. I'll drink one to UTD next time.

      Hi, everyone. Sorry it's been a while, and thanks for checking back.  Lucky me, this past weekend I drove down to Del Rio, Texas, as promised. Unbelievably, Yolanda stood me up! I was in San Antonio, ready to hang out with her, but she was with her family for  Father's Day . Eh, only losers spend Father's Day with their dads. Just kidding, Yolanda. That's not what  really  makes you a loser. Ha! Just kidding again.  On the way to Del Rio, I took a pit stop in Austin to visit Miles. We had a great time, although it was so great that we ended up passing out at 10pm on a Friday instead of going downtown to  Sixth Street  like we had planned to. We went to dinner at the Hula Hut, where we were waited on by a twentysomething Mrs. Doubtfire. In addition, the tres leches cake was not soggy  enough , and Miles and I expounded on the possible circumstances which produce not-soggy-enough cake.   urlLink    What is he doing to that Corona??&nbsp; urlLink     After dinner, Miles had the bright idea of going home for a nap, awaking around 10pm, catching a cab downtown, and drinking all night. It sounded acceptable enough to me, but once we got home, the Texas heat and yummy dinner had wiped us out...we were pretty sedate. So we watched TV and talked for a while, catching up on things like favorite bands and  recent traumas . Then Miles fell asleep just in time to miss Denis Leary's classic,  No Cure for Cancer . We both kind of hit the sack around 10pm, thus ruining our plans. But I didn't care. In fact, it was nice to be able to just relax and not live the fabulous exciting life that I got on my 21st birthday. Lesson: True friendship is falling asleep in front of the TV at 10 on a Friday night with  no judgment .  The next morning, I went on to Del Rio. Wow, what a, um, quaint town. I stayed at the local Best Western, which is really just a self-explanatory anecdote right there. One important distinction to add: six guys were  barbecuing --grill and all--on the sidewalk of the motel, right outside my room. You gotta love that sense of festivity.   Of course, my trip had one main objective: to visit my friend Jesus. This is his new place.   urlLink    Cacti and razorwire...ah, Texas.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Didn't Reagan die two weeks ago?&nbsp; urlLink     It was seriously depressing to be there for the first ten minutes of waiting and nonsense. The staff are curt and dismissive, and I was told within seconds of walking in, "Sweetie, you can't wear that to visit." Of course. How stupid of me to think that I'd be allowed to wear a  plain white t-shirt  into a prison. I almost cried right there, but instead I went to my car to change shirts in the parking lot. Thank god I had my luggage with me in the car.  I teared up some more later as I thought of how futile and bleak it must feel to live in jail. I mean, I had virtually  no clout  as a visitor from 400 miles away. Imagine how little anyone must care about what the prisoners have to say. But it's supposed to be punishment, after all, so I can't really call 'foul' on my friend's situation. Luckily, Jesus was looking and acting just fine. A little sick with the sniffles, but he was in decent spirits and happy to see me. We had a 40 minute visit one day, and an hour visit the next day. I caught him up on all these blog stories, since he can't read what I write here.   On the way out of Del Rio, I bought some peaches and homemade beef jerky at a roadside stand. The peaches were delicious and the jerky was truly some of the manliest jerky I've ever had. Good stuff. Driving back up to Dallas, I stopped for a late lunch with Miles again and had something called  tomato pie . And a gingerbread pancake. Miles taunted me about my bizarre eating predilections. I have no comment for the guy who ate an English muffin and some reheated broccoli for dinner once.  And finally, some promised pictures. The picture of my new tattoo didn't turn out at all, so you will have to wait on that one a bit longer. Here are pics of my glasses and my other tattoo, though. Enjoy!   urlLink    My new look.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Drowsy, pouty, and pensive?&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    My little lizard from 1998.&nbsp; urlLink

      I went to the dentist today. I got  eight fillings ! This is the first time I've had any dental work done other than a cleaning and checkup. I go my entire life with no cavities, and suddenly I have eight. The world is full of mystery.  So they started me off with some topical anesthetic that was cherry flavored. Man, it was good. I liked it a lot, and I joked to the dentist about spreading it on some toast. He joked back that it packs quite a chaser (referring to the Novocaine, aka  cocaine  in some circles).  Have you ever noticed that doctors and such have their own brand of abstruse lingo? I don't mean your usual shop talk. For instance, the dentist today looked at my chart and commented, "So, we're going all 'round the Maypole today, hmm?" I mumbled assent, having no idea what he was talking about. A few seconds later, I realized that he meant that I had fillings in all four quadrants, thus requiring a complete "circular" tour of my mouth. Thanks, dentist with your  weird verbiage . Last week my psychiatrist called me a virgin. Seconds afterward, he went on about how I had never been on any medications. Ohhhh.  That  kind of virgin. Well, why didn't you say so, doctor??  Now, my mouth is very numb and I am at home, trying to drink water. Want to hear something gross? I tried to eat a  miniature cream puff , but my tongue and lower lip are both out of commission. I kinda chewed the best I could, trying not to bite myself. Then I made the mistake of looking at my mouth in the mirror. Ew, little half-chewed bits of cream puff, all up in there! See, I can't feel anything, so I can't tell that I've got a dismantled pastry floating around in my mouth. I told you it was gross. I guess I'll drink some water to try to take care of that.  Oh well, the good news is that my teeth are fixed for now. It was even kind of fun. I'm numb for another few hours, so if you read this in time, you can call me and laugh at my handicapped voice. Someone might as well get some use out of those  eight shots  in the gums. Everyone else, have a great day with your normally-functioning mouths. Think of those less fortunate than you.

      This weekend, I am driving to Del Rio, Texas, to visit my good friend Jesus. For those of you who didn't grow up in Texas, or were just  Hispanically-challenged  like I was, that's Jesus as in "Hay-soos." Heh, I remember moving to Texas and being totally confused and freaked out to find that some people were named Jesus. Almost, but not quite, as startling as being named Ascension or Assumption. Gotta love the Catholics.  So Jesus is a really good friend of mine who got arrested and jailed last summer. Since then, he's been in prison. For a long time, he was waiting for his sentencing hearing. Now he's been sentenced and he's serving the remainder of his sentence, which was about thirty months. Lucky guy, he is. At one time he was looking at  20 to life . All of us are glad that it didn't end up that way.  Jesus and I used to have all kinds of fun eating at good restaurants, going to movies, hanging out at a bar, or just chilling on the balcony at my place. When I first met him, he was so drunk that he didn't even remember me afterward. This was in South Padre, Texas, at spring break. I had  Ronald McDonald  hair. I thought it was cute, but the color and the bleaching ravaged my hair.   urlLink    Bad picture, but you get the idea about the hair.&nbsp; urlLink     Anyway, so that's where we met, even though it turned out that we were both students at UTD and I lived right next to his best friend, Cassie. Funny how things work out. At that time, I thought he'd be a fun and cool person to hang out and goof off with. Little did I know that Jesus was a really smart, insightful, and classy guy. I remember the night that this finally dawned on me. We were hanging out at the local IHOP at some ungodly hour, talking on and on about life and stuff. Right then, I realized that I never had a clue that Jesus would end up being an  IHOP friend . You know the type, although you might call him or her your Denny's friend or Waffle House friend. You can sit there for hours and shoot the bull and it never, ever, ever feels boring or like a waste of time. Christina is my IHOP girl 4eva...even though she went and sold out to the Atkins diet so she can't chow on too many pancakes anymore. Jesus was my IHOP guy, and I miss that.  So this weekend I'll be seeing him for the first time since the last time which, I'll have you know, was at a local upscale strip club. Jesus was the only person I ever went to a strip club with, and I had so much fun each time. I even met some of the girls, who were very sweet and nice. See, in addition to being smart and uh, entrepreneurial, Jesus had strong ties with  community service  organizations. He had some friends visiting with a convention or retreat or something. He invited me along with them to go salsa dancing downtown, then afterward we went to the club. And that was the last I saw of dear Jesus.  I can't wait to see him on Saturday! I'll be visiting my friends Miles in Austin and Yolanda in San Antonio along the way, so it will be like a big Texan road trip/scavenger hunt for old friends. The only part I'm dreading is the stretch between San Antonio and Del Rio. However, Del Rio is on the border so I'll be able to visit Mexico if I want and drink some tasty  horchata  (as if it isn't available right here in Dallas at the taqueria off Spring Valley Road). Mmm, horchata.   urlLink    Mmmmmmmmmm!&nbsp; urlLink

      Yes, that's right, I have gone and gotten myself a new tattoo. My friends Christina and Amelia were there to witness it themselves. In fact, Amelia was supposed to get her septum pierced and Christina was supposed to get  Teflon beads  implanted between her knuckles, but they both chickened out. Ohhh man, the agony of missing the Teflon beads bandwagon.  So I got this design that Richard drew for me. Richard is an older dude who also drew and tattooed my  lizard  for me back in '98. In fact, his business card reads, "Not Old Skool--Just Old." He's a funny guy but also polite and not condescending like some body artists can be, so I like him a lot.  The design I chose was something like a crescent moon with Japanese woodblock-esque waves crashing over it. The tattoo itself is a perfect circle, but the moon area is just a sliver, and the rest is filled with those crashing waves. I like it immensely. I had started out with the idea of a moon for various reasons. I'm crazy and moody, and of course the moon is symbolic of  lunacy . I'm a woman, and ditto. Finally, I'm a Cancer and the moon is the ruler of this zodiac sign, so it was appropriate. In addition, I kinda wanted to add a Japanese or Asian element in order to signify this huge transitional phase in my life. I wanted to commemorate my move to Japan with my tattoo. Yet you wouldn't see me caught dead with one of those Chinese character tattoos. They are so played out. I'm sorry to sound rude if some of you readers have one, but really...the trend got too pseudo-philosophical for me. But that's okay, because some of you are rolling your eyes at my getting another tattoo in the first place: "Such a trend monger."  Disclaimer: I don't really think I'm that crazy. I know that  real  crazy is not a pretty picture, and I don't mean to diminish that in any way.  So Richard drew a design to my liking. I decided to place it on my back, in the center, just below my shoulder blades. None of that " small of my back " shite for me...see reasons above. And we commence with the needle-stabbing. I have a high tolerance for pain, so this was not a problem. I winced once or twice, but definitely nothing that was remotely hard to handle.  Christina and Amelia watched and chatted. I was facing away from them, so when I would hear them laugh, luckily I couldn't see if they were  snickering  at mistakes being made on my tattoo. All in all, it probably took about ten minutes. Afterward, I looked at it in the mirror and grinned the Newly-Tattooed Idiot Grin. What a great use for $75.  I will put up pictures of both my tattoos soon. In the meantime, I am contemplating a new place to get pierced. I am  running out  of places, since I want to avoid the face. I will keep you posted as usual. This will probably be my last tattoo for the rest of my life, and I'm glad it turned out so well. As long as it heals well, I'll be good to go!

      Well, it's time that I wrote about  Japan  again. That's the purpose of this blog, right? So I'd like to invite you to meet the family members that I'll be living with or near while in Iwakuni.  First there's my mom. She's staying in Louisiana, for the time being. She has lived in America for over twenty-five years, after all. She has a  thriving  interior design business in Shreveport. Still, she manages to visit Japan often, about twice a year and sometimes more.   urlLink    My mother (on the right) and her niece, Michiko. I think they look alike.&nbsp; urlLink     That is also my cousin Michiko. She likes to dance and she's been to America. We can't talk much, but I think she has a funny sense of humor and she's a down-to-earth, smart woman.  Then there is my aunt Nobuko, whom I've always thought was really awesome. I remember when I was younger, I used to think it was so cool that she dyed her hair and wore loud clothes. Now, I admire her cooking skills. She likes to cater the parties of her close friends, for free! Don't you wish you had a friend like that? I think that I look a lot like Aunt Nobuko, and her daughter Michiko looks a lot like my mom. What do you think? I would say "switched at birth," but Michiko is a few years older than me. Still, I smell a  conspiracy ...   urlLink    My cool aunt and her daughter, Michiko.  I think I look more like my aunt than my mother.&nbsp; urlLink     Next is my aunt's husband, Uncle Shiraki. He is a funny, laidback kind of guy. He works really hard with the family business (they run a shop in Iwakuni). I remember when I was a kid, he would quietly slip coins into my pockets. They have a convenience store across the street from their house, and I would use this  slyly procured  money to buy candy and stuff. He has always been a very kind and generous person. I like to tease him about his hair, and he likes to tease me about my boyfriends.     urlLink    My hilarious uncle, husband of my aunt above.&nbsp; urlLink     Then there's my other two cousins, Tadao and Naoko. They are the other two kids of my aunt and uncle. Tadao is nice but I don't know him very well. He lives in Tokyo and leads a  very busy  life. My aunt says (not jokingly) that she has to read about how he's doing in his editorials for the magazine he works at. I hung out with him a couple of times and I think he's super cool, just maybe more of a loner (like me). We talked about  socialized medicine  once, and he's a smart guy. Naoko is a really sweet, kind woman. She took me around Tokyo a few times when it was still new to me, and she tolerated my touristy gawking and my desire to play video games. She's married to a great guy named Mr. Gomi. Gomi-San speaks very good English and just got his law degree in America a couple of years ago. He's also a lot of fun to be around and is up for trying new stuff (like moving to America for law school, for example...wow).   urlLink    My cousin Tadao, his sister Naoko, and her husband Gomi-San.  All very cool.&nbsp; urlLink     Finally, last but not least...my grandparents. My grandfather has since died. He died a little over one year ago. He was THE coolest though. Kind, generous, humorous, and full of curiosity and adventurousness. He fought in WWII, traveled a lot (came to America twice), farmed most his life, made it through the post-war depression in Japan, and LOVED to eat  steak . During my last visit while he was alive, I cooked many steaks for him. My grandmother loves steak, too. She's super-tough and still goes out walking in the fields every morning, in freezing temperatures sometimes. She has put my friends and me to shame as far as hardiness to the elements. She also keeps a journal still, and has for her entire life since she could write. I have kept a diary for over twenty years now, and my aspiration is to keep writing into old age, just like my grandmother does.    urlLink    My beloved grandparents.&nbsp; urlLink     And this is the house that I'll be staying at with my grandmother. It's huge! It's gray (one of my favorite colors)! It has three bathrooms! Life is gonna be spectacular here.   urlLink    Mi casa de Iwakuni.&nbsp; urlLink     I have received my materials for learning Japanese and moving, so maybe I'll write about that next time. Have a great week.

      I'm bipolar. Wait, I'm bipolar??  I went to the doctor last week as I mentioned I would. First, I sat in the waiting room for a whole hour. That was fun. I even had to cancel my tutoring appointment that day because I was running so late after going to the doctor.  Bastards .  Then, I got to sit in a big office and talk about myself for about an hour and a half. Now for some people, this may seem  self-absorbed  or awkward, but man do I love to talk about myself. Bonus points for doing it in an appropriate situation as opposed to at a party. No one likes the conversation monopolist at a party (Miles!).    urlLink    Is this the face of a crazy person??&nbsp; urlLink     I told this woman, who was  not  the psychiatrist, about my childhood, my relationships, my temper, my mood swings, and my outlook on life ( mostly cloudy ). She took copious notes. She asked salient questions. She was very matter-of-fact and didn't really show a lot of sympathy, which I dug. Professional all the way.  Then I sat in the waiting room some more. You know, because they could tell I was starting to miss it.  Then, I spoke with the psychiatrist for half an hour or so. He had "heard" from his assistant (the woman I spoke with) that I had self-diagnosed as having Borderline personality disorder. He explained to me how the personality disorders, as a category, were messy, disparate, and vague. He then detailed how he personally believed that Borderline people were actually a  grand intersection  of psychological disorders, varying in intensity and frequency. Basically, he thinks that Borderline is a combination of ADHD, PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder), and the bipolar spectrum (which includes depression, mania, and both together as in bipolar disorder).  Is this getting too technical? I apologize.  So, given my symptoms, he diagnosed me as being bipolar. It's true that I don't have episodes of  mania  (except when fried plantains are involved), which is why I got tagged with "bipolar NOS" (not otherwise specified), a variant of bipolar which is kind of a catch-all for the leftovers that don't fit into more classical descriptions of bipolar disorder.   urlLink    How about this? Ok, yeah maybe...&nbsp; urlLink      He gave me a sample pack of an anti-psychotic to start out with. Whoo, I've finally hit the big time. The first two and a half days that I tried it, I was  miserable . Totally, utterly miserable. I felt completely drained yet hopelessly jittery and restless at the same time. I had to pace around at work and lie on the floor during tutoring. I couldn't find a suitable position to sleep in at night, I was constantly switching chairs in the lab (where I work), and my daily driving around made me feel trapped in a box. It was awful.  I wanted to quit right then, after a day and a half. However, the assistant woman listened to my grievances and assured me that I was feeling some common side effects. I guess the worst part for me was not knowing if it was the medication, or if it was just the heat, stress, allergies, or   something  else. I mean, I had cut down to half a tab on the second day but I still felt crazed. So she suggested I take a quarter tab (yeah, I think that's called  homeopathic medicine ), so that's what I did. The side effects did eventually wear off for the most part. I still feel restless a lot, but I am combating that by walking, running, swimming, and all that other good stuff.  When I got out of that first appointment and walked back down to my car with my little packet of pills and my collection of pamphlets, I started crying. I kept thinking, "So, it has really come to this.  Unbelievable ." For those of you who know me, I hope this isn't too much information for you. I am trying to be forthright with these aspects of my personality because I feel like I've tried to dismiss them and hide them all this time. It seems like that approach backfired on me, so now I'm trying a new approach.  Whatever is truly going on with my brain, I know that it's not such a huge deal. I am what they call " high-functioning ," which for me means that I have pretty much everything going for me except for how I feel. Basically it's a term for people who are able to keep their lives together despite their psychological problems. Some people are devastated by their mental illness, and I know I'm lucky to be able to work, go to school, have friends, and even dress and feed myself.   Got an opinion about  meds  and mental health? I'd love to hear it since I'm new to this whole medicated life thing. IM me or email me...my info is in the profile. In the meantime, I will write about any discernable changes in personality/feeling/mood as they arise. Wish me luck!

      I haven't been to a zoo since I was two years old or something. I used to live in  San Diego , and sure enough they have the zoo to end all zoos, but I don't really remember it. I have been through a drive-through safari in Japan (and we thought Americans were the laziest! Ha), and I have been trying to go to the Fort Worth Zoo for years now, but to no avail. It's true that I was bitten by an ostrich when I was thirteen...maybe there was some emotional scarring at work, keeping me from returning to the zoo.  Well, New Orleans has the famous Audubon Zoo, and I decided to go while I was down there. Man, that is one big zoo. Of course, I wouldn't know because I haven't been to a zoo for decades, but I think I walked five miles or something. And all in the  oppressive  New Orleans heat and humidity.  The first thing they greet you with is a flamingo exhibit. There was a baby flamingo sitting in its nest, flapping its wings awkwardly. Sooo cute. Seriously, what's cuter than  baby animals ? The zoo also had baby cheetahs, baby alligators, and some adorable baby tropical birds of indeterminate species (I don't pay attention to signs too often).    urlLink    Supermodel legs&nbsp; urlLink     I followed the map's suggested route and wandered around eight major sections. When I passed McDonald's  , I heard some birds rummaging in the underbrush. I looked over and saw a pair of peacocks! At first I was alarmed, thinking that they had  escaped . I wondered if I should tell an employee. Then, I started looking around and realized that there were a lot of exotic-looking birds hanging out in the open. So I figured that they were allowed to roam free. Funny thing is, I didn't even see any peacocks on display in the zoo. Later, I asked a security guard, and she told me that they sometimes try to run out the front entrance and the workers have to lure them back in. Don't feel too bad, this zoo is huge and I don't think they're hurting for room or food.  Here are a few more pictures from my adventure.   urlLink    Toucan Sam!&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    A white tiger from the Audubon Zoo!&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Cute giraffes.&nbsp; urlLink     In all, I had a great time, got a decent tan, and walked off the beignets from the morning. The Audubon Zoo is definitely a must-see if you are visiting the Big Easy. Take the St. Charles streetcar west to the  Audubon Place  stop (near Tulane), and then ride the free shuttle to the Zoo. That way, you don't have to walk two miles to your car. Once you're inside, however...well, exercise is good for you.  Have fun!

      Today we're going to have a little geography quiz. We're going to be learning about  Acadiana . Let's see if you can correctly pronounce the following words.  1.  Pontchartrain 2.  Opelousas 3.  Avoyelles 4.  Breaux Bridge 5.  Cloutierville 6.  Tchoupitoulas 7.  Calcasieu 8.  Grosse Tete 9.  Ouachita 10. Natchitoches 11. Atchafalaya 12. Euterpe 13. Coushatta 14. Lecompte 15. Thibodaux 16. Zwolle   urlLink    Hey, a street with a normal-looking name.&nbsp; urlLink     How did you do? Remember, many of these words are not pronounced in the traditional  French  style. Louisiana has its very own rendition of its French-based names. Now, please exchange papers with a neighbor and we will grade them.  Next time...news about the Audubon Zoo and mailing packages to Japan.

      Ok, I want to explain the title of this entry right off the bat. When we all arrived in Tokyo on Sunday night and shuffled off to our hotel rooms, my roommates and I agreed to set the alarm clock to 6:45 in order to be ready for breakfast. Then, much  snoring  ensued. Next thing I know, the rosy glow of dawn is diffusing in through our hotel room window. It's already pretty bright outside. I drowse around a bit and mumble, "Hey guys, our clock must be broken because it's definitely past seven." But Brooke corrects me...it's 4:30 am and yes, that's how 4:30 am looks in Tokyo. I had NO idea. It was quite unsettling the first morning.  Now, I'm writing from another internet cafe in, this time, Iwakuni. I made it 'home' last Wednesday after another long bus ride, a plane ride, and a long car ride. A man with a high-school gym teacher's  flat-top  haircut and pants a couple inches too short greeted me at the airport along with the woman who was the office translator at my school board. They were both very nice and I was able to hold a decent conversation with them. They wanted to take me out for lunch and spent a long time tracking down a good soba shop after I let it slip that I loved zaru-soba (cold buckwheat noodles, eaten in summer). After he called a few people and finally found the promising place, we found out they don't serve soba at lunch. Or they were out. Or something. All I understood was that soba wasn't available, and my hosts felt terrible about it. I assured them that it was not important and we could try again next week.  Once I got home, I really got hit with a wave of insecurity and doubt. The house was absolutely sweltering. Seriously, the damn place felt like a  sauna  and even the floors were warm. I had just spent the past four days with hundreds and hundreds of other foreigners (being annoyed by most of them), but now all of a sudden I was alone with no way to contact my new friends. I knew that they were out there, some only a few miles away, but I was suddenly an island.  I really wondered if I had just made a huge mistake. One year like this, with the heat and the  giant mosquitos  and no one around to talk in my muttering, sarcastic English with? I started crying.  The next morning, I woke up and rode my grandmother's bike to Chuo Food (my local grocery store). I bought some things to help me transition into my new home (like the most adorable  sweat rags  you'll ever lay eyes on) and some groceries to get me through a couple of days. Surprise! I found a good avocado. I decided to make guacamole, but without any tortilla chips, I was forced to eat it on a sandwich with sliced chicken breast which I also made.  Yesterday, my aunt drove me to DeoDeo (electronics store) and I bought some computer speakers and plug adapters. I nearly lost it when I couldn't find a crucial component for my monitor and was left to assume that Customs had confiscated it. Right then, I was about to shoot myself. Then, I looked under the coffee table and realized that I had kicked it there. Never before have I been so relieved at my own  stupidity . Finally, with every cord in place, I turned on my computer.  It worked. It works. I am home.  Now, it's time for me to go buy: an alarm clock, a bathing stool, an umbrella, a cutting board, spoons, drinking glasses (that are larger than shot glasses from Snuffer's), kitchen towels, and combustibles/non-combustibles trash bags.

      Well, I am in Tokyo now, typing on a computer at Kinko's in Shinjuku.&nbsp;The typing goes slowly, as I have to look around for the apostrophe and delete keys.   The orientation in Tokyo has been quite a surreal experience, as the cliche goes. We all descended upon the Keio Plaza Hotel like a plague of locusts&nbsp;(ah, now you get it) starting&nbsp;early yesterday afternoon and finishing up around midnight.&nbsp;The Houston group&nbsp;(with whom I traveled) was delayed&nbsp;a few hours along with NYC and Seattle, so we lost out on most of our "wandering around the streets like&nbsp;children on  crack and Kool-Aid " time, although I heard that some people went out anyway, despite getting to the hotel at 11pm, being jet-lagged, and having mandatory&nbsp;meetings early next morning.   I have really been on my toes with the acquaintance-making skills, since I am seated between two new people every couple of hours, and we are all desperate to break the ice before any awkwardness sets in. It's a funny situation; in such a "bonding" experience as this, I feel like it would be a  cold flat&nbsp;insult  to not make small talk with my cohorts, since everyone else is&nbsp;spiritedly asking personal questions&nbsp;and pretending to take note of the answers. I can ignore a stranger pretty well, but&nbsp;I suppose that's because I don't know their situation and&nbsp;never will. The JETs are all in the same boat, though, and being aloof just seems downright stuck-up and pretentious.   Still, there are plenty of people I'm steering clear of: the overenthusiastic&nbsp;self-declared Houston JET representative (think overbearing student council vice president); the mouthy, somewhat  sloppy-looking  drunkard;&nbsp;the dim, lunkheaded,&nbsp;"how did this person ever get into this program" garden-variety dolt.   I have also met some awesome and like-minded&nbsp;individuals like my roommate&nbsp;in Houston, my roommate here in Tokyo, and one of the JETs going to Yamaguchi with me. Another cool thing is that I'm meeting&nbsp;people with all kinds of  accents , most commonly British,&nbsp;Australian, New Zealandish (?),Canadian, and Jamaican. I really love the diversity and the international vibe that's happening here right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I really wanted to take some time&nbsp;to describe how utterly  homoerotic  the video we watched today was, but I think I'm a little too short on time&nbsp;(I've got a reception to go to soonish). My&nbsp;speech in Houston went over really well and I've&nbsp;received a lot of positive comments about it, so that was nice. Get your autographed copies for just $9.95! Um, heh. That's about&nbsp;the best I can do right now.   I am getting out of here on Wednesday morning. I'll be  flying  to Yamaguchi that&nbsp;day, then probably getting driven to&nbsp;Iwakuni (my city). From there, who knows how long it will be until I get an internet connection at home. Hopes&nbsp;remain high, though, so I'll do what I can. Let's just&nbsp;keep our fingers crossed that the desktop I&nbsp;mailed arrives in the proper amount of pieces.   No pictures for now, but keep an eye out. Bye!   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I have nothing of interest to report from the past week or so, but I wanted to let you know that I haven't abandoned the self-promotional blog project. My days are majorly boring. All I do is pack stuff, clean (very little of that going on though), surf the web, and contemplate the  mystery  of the next couple of weeks. I haven't even been hanging out with friends, since most of them are out of town and I've lost touch with the rest so badly that I'm too sheepish to call them.   I've been wearing "disposable clothes" and will be doing so until I leave for Japan. It's good that I own so many shirts that I don't mind throwing out after one last wearing. Having to live out of a suitcase for a week is one thing, but having to live out of a  grocery bag  for another week before that just sucks. But I've got to have everything packed up and ready to ship or store days before I actually leave the U.S. (because of my apartment situation), so I have little choice. God, I hate moving.   I'll probably have one more update before I actually land in Japan, and then, with any luck, the hilarity ensues. Right now, I'll just send out wishes for a hassle-free summer for everyone else.

      Here I am with the promised pictures from my recent trip to Mexico. Those of you who told me that Mexico City was very cultural and very dirty were right. The occasional putrid smells and little black puddles didn't bother me too much, but the culture was certainly a sight to behold.  On our first evening, we walked through the Zocalo, which is a large plaza in the Historical Center that contains the National Cathedral, the National Palace, and several other important buildings with spectacular architecture. We went into the Cathedral, where a girl was having her  quinceanera  as family and tourists watched. I took pictures, but since flash was prohibited, they didn't turn out. My mom commented that the family must have some big money, awesome connections, or both to get their little girl's quince to be held in such a hallowed church.   urlLink    View of the National Cathedral from our hotel in the Zocalo.&nbsp; urlLink     The next day, we took a tour to Teotihuacan, where the pyramids are. This little excursion was great fun. Our tourguide, Oscar, started us off with mini-visits to the Three Cultures Plaza and the two Shrines of Guadalupe (the original and new ones). There was a big bronze statue of  Pope John Paul II , which I thought was amusing (statues of living people always amuse me for some reason). Then, we went on to Teotihuacan.   urlLink    The original Shrine of Guadalupe, whose front end is perceptibly sinking into the ground.&nbsp; urlLink     At Teotihuacan, another guide demonstrated the indigenous crafts that were still being practiced. The maguey plant (agave), for instance, was used for sewing, weaving, writing parchment, and of course  pulque and mezcal , alcoholic spirits. We also saw some (probably grossly underpaid) workers carving with obsidian, lapis, jade, and tigereye. Then they took us to the gift shop and threatened us with ritual sacrifice unless we bought those same souvenirs, soaked in the blood and sweat of exploited indigenous workers. Ah, just kidding. Yeah, the gift shop was a little touristy, but I picked up the effing coolest silver necklace ever. Like a dork, I am pictured wearing it in the photos that follow.  Oscar told us that local legend says that anyone who climbs the Sun Pyramid will have good luck for seven years. Furthermore, anyone who climbs both the Sun and Moon Pyramids will have prosperity and good health for the entirety of  this incarnation ! Well, some deals are just too good to pass up, so I resolved to accomplish this feat.  Wow, those steps are  steep . I'm talking look-down-and-can't-even-see-the-steps-below-you steep. Some ascents were virtually sheer, and you had to climb while grasping at the steps ahead of you which were right in front of your nose. To compound the  heart-stopping thrills , I had worn flimsy flip-flops because I didn't want to mess up my new sneakers. On my way down the Sun Pyramid, I spotted the Haitian girl from our tour group, lying on one of the steps with a crowd of people around her and water being splashed on her face. Turns out she hadn't eaten breakfast that morning and passed out or something.   urlLink    At the top of the Sun Pyramid in Teotihuacan....&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    ...and (pant, pant) at the top of the Moon Pyramid.&nbsp; urlLink     On the way down from the Moon Pyramid, I passed a young man who was climbing on his  crutches . I was so terrified for him that it was hard to watch him take each halting step. Some British folks from my group told me later that he made it all the way to the top. Wow. I hope he made it down all right, too. I wish I had taken a picture of him, because I was amazed at his bravery. Or foolishness.   urlLink    My mom made it halfway up!&nbsp; urlLink     On Day Three, we decided to brave the Mexico City subway,  El Metro . Turns out that it was a piece of cake, aside from enduring some hearing loss because of the monotonously-droning peddlers that climb onto the train at each stop, intending to sell cheap bootlegs of Spiderman 2 or shoddy portable tool sets. We went to the Mercado de la Merced, one of the biggest open-air markets in the world. I bought some mole...about five times more than what I would ever use in this lifetime, but my Spanish skills leave something (everything) to be desired, and it was dirt cheap anyway.   Then we traveled to Coyoacan to visit the Frida Kahlo museum. This may have been the highlight for me, since I am a fan of Frida Kahlo's paintings. The museum is actually her house, with the rooms converted into exhibits. I got to view several of her famous paintings and even more of her less-famous work, the plaster corsets and  back braces  that she endured because of her accident, her written letters to Diego Rivera, photographs of the couple, and their various art collections. To top it off, there were cats in the courtyard! I love cats. In all, it was incredibly enthralling for me.  On our last day, we happened by a museum as we were walking to the subway station (if you throw a stone twenty feet in any direction in Mexico City, you're bound to hit a museum). This museum displayed an exhibit entitled, "Instruments of Torture and Capital Punishment." Intrigued, I walked in...wary, my mom followed. We viewed an extensive collection of the most  cruel, nightmarish, and chilling  devices I've ever had to think about. All the classics were there (the rack, the guillotine, the garrotte, the iron maiden), along with some truly grotesque gadgets like the rectal pear, the heretic's fork, and the jock's mare. If you're sickly fascinated, read about some of them at www.torturamuseum.com. It was definitely a memorable endnote for our vacation.  Yep, Mexico was great, and I'm glad I got to go while I'm still in the Western Hemisphere. My only problem was not knowing Spanish. I knew enough to ask questions, but that was pointless when I didn't know enough to understand the answers. Ah well, one more language to learn. I hope you guys will visit someday, if you haven't already!

      I'm checking in with you readers today while in a sour mood, so forgive all my complaining.  I am leaving for Japan with the Houston group. I have to get myself to Houston by 1pm on July 23rd. I live in Dallas, and my parents live in Shreveport, Louisiana. The  monkey wrench  in this situation is my car, which I am leaving with my mother so that she can trade it in or sell it. Also, since I don't see my parents very often, I thought it would also be nice to spend some time with them before I leave for what might be one year, three years, or the rest of my life.  Adding another dimension of confusion is the fact that I sorta got fired yesterday. Not really fired, but my  dumber-than-a-sack-of-wet-mice  boss erroneously filed paperwork that effectively terminated me as of June 30th. Somehow, she had no idea that she had done this, and claims to have no idea that I was slated to stay on through July 15th. So that means that a)I no longer have a job through July 15th, and b)I've been working for two days now while having "terminated" status.  Can you believe that  cretinous, conniving shrew  actually suggested (with a nervous chuckle) that I might be able to write off my unpaid days as a "donation" to the workplace? I might have considered it IF I had an ounce of respect or fondness for this woman at all. But my hatred of my former boss is known far and wide throughout the land, so she was not to be so lucky as to reap any "donations" from me.  The relevance to my story is that I had originally intended to stay in Dallas until the 20th, so that I could work until the 15th, then collect my final check. Now I have no such  fetters , although my plans will probably remain pretty much the same. Also, this development has left me without those last few dollars that I was intending to use for moving costs.  On top of that, I am getting kicked out of my apartment on the 17th, which means that I'll have to squat somewhere for a week. I'll be staying at Damon's apartment with him for my last days in Dallas, then drive to Shreveport to drop off the car and spend time with my parents. After that, I'll take a plane to Houston from Shreveport.  Or so I thought.  Yeah, it kinda sucked that I'd have to say goodbye to Damon four days before I was actually leaving, but his car won't make it to Shreveport or Houston, he can't drive my car because it's a standard, etc. But then my dad offered to loan his  truck  to Damon so that we could drive down to Houston from Shreveport in the truck and Damon could see me off properly. Then Damon could drive back to Shreveport, return the truck, and take a bus home to Dallas.  That sounded great to me! Alas, Damon has some big school project that can't be neglected. My personal feelings about this are that he'll probably regret not tossing logic to the wind and seeing me for those final moments. After all, difficult and unpleasant and precarious doesn't equal  impossible . But his reason, however disappointing and frustrating, is valid enough. It's gonna have to be, anyway.  So then I start looking for plane tickets to Houston from Shreveport, and they cost an arm and a leg ($300). Then I check how much the flight would be from Dallas. A paltry $100. Furthermore, the flights from Shreveport to Houston all  connect in Dallas  anyway. So I'd be paying an extra $200 just to fly back to the same city I came from anyway. The city I live in. The city I could have departed to Houston from if not for the damned car. Do you feel my pain now?  So I could take a bus from Shreveport to Dallas in order to save myself about $170...coincidentally, the extra $170 that I probably wouldn't have been stressing over if I had just  gotten that last damn paycheck !! But I don't really want to go Greyhound at some godawful hour (very early, to ensure I'll make it to DFW in time),in my business wear, carrying my international luggage, having nothing to look forward to afterward but another trip in another cramped, crowded space (my flight to Houston). I mean, bus trips are scarring experiences. But I really don't want to pay way too much for a stupid flight to stupid Houston. I thought about using my frequent flyer miles to pay for it, but that just offends my sense of justice and dignity. Frequent flyer miles are for impromptu visits to Hawaii or Germany, not for the most utilitarian and dreaded of voyages.  I'm still undecided about what I'll be doing to get the hell out of Dodge, but I'm sure it'll be a headache no matter what. If you know anyone driving that weekend from Shreveport to Dallas, or from Dallas to Houston, or from Shreveport to Houston, or from Dallas to Tokyo, put me in touch...  Soon: pics from Mexico, i.e. pyramids 'n' me.

      First off, I'd like to apologize for the recent lack of photos. My last couple of entries (and this one) do not really necessitate photos, and I don't really care to post  random shots . I guess I could have put up a picture of frothy beer ickiness, but who wants to look at that?  Ok, one random photo to keep things on the up and up.   urlLink    This is me, smashing your ugly mug in Trinity-style on Halloween.&nbsp; urlLink     What a great excuse to use that picture.  The news is that I'll be flying to Mexico City in two days. My mom and I are taking a special little bonding vacation together. 'Cause nothing bonds like pollution and  pickpocket chicanery . In seriousness, I'm looking forward to absorbing the vast amounts of culture that appear to reside in D.F. For instance, the ever-trendy Frida Kahlo museum will definitely be a stop on the tour for us. If only they had monkeys hopping around.  My one concern is that I don't speak Spanish. I thought that maybe I knew enough to get by, but then I realized that all I know is food words. I can't direct a cabdriver, ask for the check, or  spew vitriol  at a subway groper. Funny, since I might as well have majored in shouting invective at people, but I haven't learned such choice words in any foreign languages.  So yeah, I can rattle off a couple dozen vocabulary words pertaining to how I'd like my tamarind juice or what kind of sauce I want with my shrimp, but I know next to nothing about structure and grammar and things that tie nouns together (like, oh, verbs). In fact, it took years for me to shake off the peculiar and random perception that "habla" means "have." I have heard that in Mexico City, it won't be too hard for me to get around. Yet, I still feel like an  ignorant American  for not having a halfway decent command of the language in the country I am visiting. It's particularly shameful when I think of all the Americans who bellow, "Learn ENGLISH!!" to unsuspecting tourists and immigrants. But I guess I wouldn't get a mind to  move  to Mexico unless I knew a fair amount of Spanish.  The worst thing is, I tend to get confused and start speaking other languages when I first get thrown into a foreign language situation. A couple of years ago, on the plane to Japan, I answered a flight attendant's question with "si." Then, the other day at a taqueria, I accidentally ordered three tamales using "san" for three instead of "tres." If I remember correctly, I would do this with  Italian  and Japanese too, when I was taking Italian in high school. So not only will I sound like an ignorant American, I will sound like I've lost my mind, speaking Japanese to the Mexicans.   I wanted to let you guys know that I won't be updating until at least Monday, when I get back. By then I will have some pictures of beautiful Mexico, and I will be sure to post them here to make up for the recent dearth.  Lastly, I want to say hi and thanks to the JET people and others who commented on my last entry. Can you believe the tragedy; those were my first comments ever! I'm glad to finally have proof that some of you are reading this. Meanwhile, not a peep from the people I actually know in real life  *hint* . That's okay, I will remain strong in the face of blatant disregard and abandonment.  Hmm, maybe I'm feeling too ludicrous to write right now. I'll take that as my cue and sign off. Everyone wish me luck in Mexico and keep your fingers crossed that I don't get kidnapped!

      Well, I seem to be in a writing mood this weekend, so I thought I'd add one more entry.  I just went to the  conbini , which is the Japanese abbreviated word for "convenience store." The conbinis in Japan sell everything from brand new white dress shirts to tiny servings of  melon-flavored  Haagen-Dasz (but no gasoline). I was going to ride to Chuo Food, but it was getting dark and I was too tired to go that far. So I stopped by FamilyMart instead to pick up enough rations for the next 12 hours or so.  Guess what I found! Greek Feta Pringles. I bought some and the only feta aspect I can discern is a faint  goatlike  flavor. The Soy Sauce Pringles I had a few years ago seem to have fallen off the market. I do believe the Squid Pringles may still be around though. They love their squid around here.  Anyway, I felt another twinge of homesickness while perusing the aisles of the conbini. So many things I've taken for granted and am now left without. I found a cookie, a real American-looking cookie like the kind you'd see at Corner Bakery (as opposed to little butter cookies or creme sandwich cookies) and  pounced  on it. It was cranberry cashew, chewy, and quite nostalgic. I also bought some little mini Snickers for my low-grade gooey chocolate craving, and some beef jerky looking stuff (hopefully not more fish sausage!).   I found that my eyes were scanning over the shelves, searching out a familiar-looking product or an English explanation. It's not the same as visiting...I'm realizing that more and more each day. Visiting Japan is an adventure, a getaway, a string of days that I expect to be out of the ordinary. But living here means that I am supposed to be having ordinary days full of my little compulsory routines which don't require me to be mentally  checked-in . Not the case at all! I have to concentrate hard each time I visit the grocery store, relying on my spasmodic reading skills to deliver me to a successful dinner or load of laundry. The pastries look delicious but I have to spend ten minutes ferretting out what they contain, and sometimes I give up trying.  Also strange is the knowledge that most English speakers I meet pepper their conversation with random Japanese words. This is the nature of hanging out with people who are in Japan not for tourism or military duty, but because they chose to come and they probably studied Japan in some form or another. Some of the words have no convenient English translation (like  izakaya , a typically  rowdy  restaurant for copious eating and drinking), and some of the words do translate, but convey more of the true meaning in their original Japanese (like  genki , which means healthy and lively but has a more complicated connotation like young, alert, cheerful, and ready to take on whatever).  Thus, my English conversations often go something like this: "I tried to call your keitai last night but I didn't get an answer." "Yeah, I was at the izakaya 'til midnight or so, then we hit a nomihodai and closed it down." "Wow, you had a busy night!" "Yep, amazingly, I'm feeling pretty genki considering." "That's good, since we have another enkai tonight."  And so on. It feels pretty bizarre to me, this hybrid language (I guess it's like Spanglish).  A lot of things feel bizarre lately. I know it's been  done to death  by every other JET that came before me, and it's being dug up and revived and made to dance around by every JET that arrived with me, but I still gotta say it. Culture shock is a muther, and I really underestimated it.

       urlLink    Cute, completely irrelevant picture of Tammy and me before our departure to Japan.&nbsp; urlLink     I've been meaning to write about this for the past several days, but I had that business trip and then all those houseguests, so this is my first chance.  I've noticed that I talk a lot of smack about people. No, really; I have been slandering, sizing up, mildly criticizing, or harshly condemning most of the people I have met on this program. It was starting to come up a lot in Tokyo during my first orientation, but then it was over and I came to my town. Then, during this second orientation in  Yamaguchi City , it really started coming out a lot. I wondered if I was getting out of hand, then I wondered if I was earning a reputation for being negative, backstabbing, or just plain gossipy.  Later that night, after proclaiming that I found this girl stupid and that guy pretentious and this other girl okay, but just a little too attention-needy, I felt very sad. I couldn't figure out why for a long time. (It wasn't because I was unhappy with my behavior, 'cause I'm way too pompous for that) Then I discovered that my sadness was a form of  homesickness . See, I have an established persona among my friends. It's abrasive, it can sting, but it's usually humorous and warm and one can find insecurity and self-deprecation if one bothers to scratch any depth below the most superficial layer. I feel like my friends know this, and they accept it in me. To be sure, a lot of people don't accept it, which is why I will never have a black book teeming with best buds...just a choice handful.  But here, the atmosphere is completely different. Everyone is purportedly on the same side, and we are all somewhat confused and vulnerable, and most people are just trying to enjoy some company, trying to forge some  friendships . However, in being myself, I have found that I feel guilty and petty for being so critical and mouthy.   That night, I was missing my friends. I was missing the feeling of being myself without second-guessing the impact of my words or the image I was projecting. I was saying  catty  stuff, then thinking, "Oh, I hope they don't think I'm a bad person now. I sure do say a lot of mean stuff. Maybe I should give it a rest. Everyone is just trying to get along; no one has done me any harm."  After I finally pieced all this together, I made a decision. Yeah, I'm a negative person, or I can easily seem so to anyone listening. Yeah, I am judgmental and I don't like lots of people and I can't keep quiet about it. Yeah, even when I do like someone I still notice their flaws. And guess what?   Lots   of people are going to dislike me for that. Lots of people are going to think I'm way too pretentious, or petty, or conceited, or unpleasant. But that's me. That's how it is back in Dallas...it's just that I never really have to associate with the ones I've already dismissed, so there's really no chance for things to get any worse.   Here, I am a member of a subset of the population in Japan, and word might get around. People might not like me. I might be seen unfavorably, due to my own actions. And I just have to accept that. I have to own that just as much as I owned it in Dallas. I was never  Miss Congeniality  in America, so why start now? I can't express my opinions, then try to squirm out of the impressions that people will get based on my very own words. I can't pass my judgments, then expect other people to withhold theirs.  Yep, this is me in Japan: negative, sniping, catty, judgmental Angela (also funny, friendly, and laidback at times). Dallas, don't you miss me?

      I just got back from a fun night out with friends. Some JETs from out of town drove over here to Iwakuni for the fireworks festival, and I offered to put them up at my place. Tonight, I'll have six people cozily sleeping on the floor of my tatami room.  So we went to the fireworks festival, and the fireworks were awesomely pretty. Apparently I take them a little too seriously as I actually  flinched  when some of the bigger ones unfurled, while my friends assured me, "No Angela, they're not real...just pretty colors in the sky, okay?" The fireworks went on for about an hour and a half...can't beat that. Not with a stick.  Then we wandered around the food stalls, which were vending things like grilled squid-on-a-stick, teriyaki chicken, octopus-fritter-type thingies, corn dogs made with deceptive  fish sausage  (not regular hot dogs) and yakisoba. And lots of beer. We found out where all that beer was going when we ran into some more JETs (the cheeseheads from my previous entry) around the food stalls. They were three sheets to the wind, and the girl they were with was carrying a big Prada bag filled with empties. Klassy.  Allow me to reassess my opinions of the cheeseheads. Sean is pretty cool. He is a horse of a different color, with an accent like a  leprechaun from Connecticut  and good manners. Patrick is obviously a good teacher, and his particular strain of peculiarity is relatively harmless, so (though he loses points for condescension) he's all right too. That first day in the office just threw me, but I think they've redeemed themselves since. On to the rest of the story.  Kirk, Jessica, Lisa, and I waded into the river below the famous Kintai bridge. It was cold! But it felt good after the muggy, warm (read: sticky, sweaty) night we were having. We only went in about knee-deep and came back out to meet the rest of the group.  Little did we know that the group was over by a different section of the river, and Sean was already running around starkers. Jessica and I made a silly little girly-pact to go swimming in our underwear together, and we took off for the river. The remaining members of our group lagged behind but evenutally joined us. When we sauntered up, sure enough, there was Sean,  naked  and presenting himself shamelessly to the nearest cellphone camera lens. He was on the shore, laughing and parading around.   Jessica and I took off our shirts and bottoms and went into the water as agreed. We stayed fairly far from the spectator set in order avoid being photographed (we succeeded). Soon thereafter, Patrick came into the river, naked of course. Erin waded in but remained chaste. Her boyfriend Nate came in with boxers, but emerged  without . The rest watched from the shore, laughed, and took pictures. It was pretty fun and I don't feel like I compromised myself too much since one of the guys was gay, one had a girlfriend, and one is the last person I would ever want to date. In other words, no sneaky female agenda here.  Patrick and Sean probably went out to drink some more, Erin, Nate, and their friends went to a club, and I came back home with Jessica and Kirk. All in all, it was memorable night of fun. Yeah, at what other job do you see your coworkers  buck naked  three days after meeting them?

      I'm back in business with the internet totally running right through my living room at a scorching 20 megs per second! (I have only heard that it is scorching; I, technologically inept, wouldn't personally know) Yes, that means I won't have to get my email rocks off at Cafe Allegro, where the smoothies are suck and the apostrophe is above the "7" key.  Deserving of just as much fanfare is the reunion, spiritually at least, of my four Tokyo friends and me. Kirk hopped over to visit me in Iwakuni just in time to get pulled over for an unfortunate  U-turn , Tammy is out wandering the streets of Kagoshima city, Brooke is making endless cheesecake faces for the eager camera, and Tim is rationing out pecans to the restless natives.   urlLink    Those of whom I speak.  urlLink     Ok, speaking of cheese...I met two of the absolute biggest cheeseheads ever today. They are two guys who are 4th year ALTs in my city, and something in Japan has definitely made them a little  touched in the head . Sean is actually a little more normal, I think, but Patrick takes the cake. He has perfected the Japanese tendency to say absolutely nothing with much solemn nodding and murmuring of " sooooo desu ne...mmmmm... " Yet he also retains the Canadian (? he's Canadian) trait of acting like a teenager without his Ritalin by getting up to wander around the room in the middle of a conversation with his boss. When asked about their first impressions of Iwakuni, this is how their responses went, translated from their incredibly solemn Japanese:   "Iwakuni...it's very close to many other places."  "Yes, very close."  "It's true."  "Ah, it is, isn't it?"  "So it's very convenient."  "Very, very convenient."  "So convenient."  "Yes, so true."  "Yes."  Oh man, I wish I could have laughed out loud during that moment, but I believe that the attempted tone was, as always, solemn, respectful. So I kept quiet. We also received gifts from the superintendent, and let me say, I have never seen two men ooh and ahh so much over a couple of  teacups . To be sure, they were nice gifts...but seriously, add some bad synth music and it would have been a softcore porn.  The rest of the time here has been somewhat boring, which is my own fault. I have long since slept off my jetlag, but you wouldn't guess that by all the napping I have done. In between naps, I ride the granny-bike to Chuo Food for groceries, or I take the one bus route I know down to Iwakuni station, and I say hi to the squid guy (who is now my pretend Japanese boyfriend, with Damon's blessing) and perhaps buy myself some cake. Mmm, cake.  This weekend, Kirk and I are going to Hiroshima for some rumored Peace Festival that he has pointed me in the direction of. Before that happens, though, I have orientation in Yamaguchi City, tomorrow and Friday. That means I'll be sharing a train and bus with Sean and Patrick, the cheeseheads (don't ask me why they are cheeseheads. That is just the word that comes to me, the same way my old roommate was undeniably a tool, and my best friend's fiance was inarguably a chump).  Enough of that! More of the cool people:  urlLink    Just look at those sullen faces.  urlLink     See you all after my trip out of town.
