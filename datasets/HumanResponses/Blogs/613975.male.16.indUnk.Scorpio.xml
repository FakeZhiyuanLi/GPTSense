      Not that it really matters. I don't have anything special to say.     It just feels good to do things "regularly"  Apparently, they hurt less then. How many years of torture? I don't know. I'm sure they kill those ones before they get there. So anyways, I went to get burgers today. Real good ones. Actually, one. And fries. And a 50/50 mix of lemonade and sprite, which is "lemon lime" so instead, I got 3/4 lemon and 1/4 lime. If my math rocks. and it does.     So I'm listening to reggie watts right now. Track 4 from simplified. Good stuff, check it out whoever reads this (ghosts! you're all ghosts!)    Back to the story that isn't really good enough to be a story.    The lady there tried to pass me a 1/2 filled cup as some kind of cruel token for my ACTUAL self serve small coca cola paper-wax beverage container. I called her on it, that I did. Then I sat down in the corner. Like the dunce corner I guess, but there were windows, and I don't think dunce's got windows. Most of them had ADD probably. The "dunces" that is. And I picked up some random lewd newspaper (lewd as in lewd advertisments strewn about)    The newspaper was crap! Anyways I was trying to read jazz show listings while some gorgeous blonde was oggling me. Oh, her hair was full of highlights, not natural of course, and she was far too dressed up (or dressed down in a dressed up fashion) to be in a joint like that. I pondered what to do.. and so I folded over the other half of the newspaper and covered her motionless face. Ah, silly bought emotions.     Models must be good at faking things.. you'd think.    No not that.     And while I was sitting at the counter, resting, drinking my 75/25 pop, staring out the windows.. a man slinked past my view (he was actually in my view, I just didn't care) asked the cashier (or whatever) to buy a hamburger with a credit card, or a check, was denied, told he could buy a pop for 2 dollars or something, and promptly left. Not very INTERESTING!    Anyways, that was when my burger was ready and I walked home. So it kind of burned into my memory.    I'm going to wrap up this cd and maybe go to bed or something. I'm still not sure what to write in here. Nothing tremendously exciting seems to happen..    Embellish the details, eh?    Adios, moon.

      You know.. carry on my wayward son? I was just listening to it, and you know...    I don't understand the point of having one of these. People tell me its for attention whoring, but if I don't do that, what? Am I screwed?    And another thing. Where are all the  urlLink emo  kids? You know, with their blubbery "omg, life is so hard, help me, I'm so sad on the inside, blahblahblah. I HATE THAT EMO  urlLink BAND  CUZ THEY SOLD OUT" or even the  urlLink goths ? Either way, I haven't been reading any bad poetry on this site yet.. and that makes me sad, ON THE INSIDE.    I'm serious. I've seen blogs about interior decorating, and coffee, and all this totally off topic karp. I just don't get it.     And what am I supposed to write in this thing? "So today I went and I cleaned up my room and found my old collection of miniatures and I was like "score!" We all know you don't deserve those kinds of juicy details.    Someone better explain it to me before I use this site to take notes with

      Really, worse than genocide, I slept in till 10:50. Those nazis and their morals, DAMNIT! Now I'm just an empty, shallow, (please pity me,) shell of a husk of an egg carton of the supermarket of my soul. And I'm hungry, and I'm locked in, and I'm really really hungry. See,  I haven't had breakfast yet... so the nazis are still better than me.    So I woke up, and my face was all scratched up and hot and with that crappy eye salt in my eyes and the bed post was humping me (mind you I have no bedpost, I sleep on a matress on a boxspring on the ground) and it was  urlLink horrible!  And you know, I keep my window open for the entertainment of others as well as the comfort of myself, but someone closed my door this morning and I lost my cross breeze! And that was  urlLink horrible!      You know, the easy trick to disconnect from a link is just to hit return after it, and then press backspace. No, really!    I'm going to stop now.. again, and go to the hardware store to get some breakfast. They have good food, right?     They'd better...    Goodbye  urlLink moon .

      I AM ALIVE! wrar! Rawr!  Roawarer!    Yeah.. something similar to that. So this alex kid links me to his blog, and I try to sign up, but someone already took my name! Thats a god damn LIE!     Anyways, long story short, I took my name, and because I use the same password for everything, it wasn't very hard to log in. GO ON! try and guess it! I'll even pay you like microsoft!    But uh, if you break in, I get a free pinata. Pinata? how do I do that squigly line?    Anyways, I need to write one of these things before my "blog" has any substance. You understand the word blog, right? Web log? Kinda slurs together. And then the lazy people were all like "BLOG BLOG BLOG BLOG!"     Actually, that was the eccentric people. The lazy people were more or less doing nothing over there in that corner. Over there.     I'm going to stop now. G'night moon.

      thats 1!  just as 6/6, 10000/10000, 1/1, ect! YES Mathematically, the numerator is the denominator's bitch. Its true. Mathematically speaking.  So I just blew 70 dollars on books and tools (books to make tools, so we can say all tools I suppose)  AND I WANT THEM NOW! So why don't we have teleporters yet! At least teleporters for things like packages, we all know  those  don't have feelings. Unless you give it a bit of your soul (or it steals it!) then it has mucho feelings, like mood swings even. It might even bite you.. packages that is. BUT THEY FLEE THROUGH THE MAIL!  So I ordered a pencil torch for kicks along with the rest of the stuff, but I've read I can't leave it on for more than 30 seconds straight. WHAT THE HELL? how will I burn a hole into the center of the earth now?  Jackasses need to make them with cooling fins and some peltier tiles!  Anyways, I had 5/5 as the title as a draft, and that was it. Though I should fill it in.  Btw, my life is very boring... SUNSET! YEAH!  And my rice is burning!
