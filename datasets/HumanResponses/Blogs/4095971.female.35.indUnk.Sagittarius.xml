      Hello and welcome to  Fast & Luce . Always keen to pinch someone else's good idea and claim it as my own, I've followed my American e-friend Megan's example by setting up my own collection of thoughts here at blogger.com - if only to avoid the ignominy of posting as 'Anonymous' when making comments on other folks' blogs.  I should perhaps point a couple of things out right away. As ever where I am concerned, spells of frenetic activity will be followed of spells of steely silence. While this may be in part connected to my ever changing mood, it's more likely to be connected to my erratic work schedule as a Freelance Artworker which can be very demanding of my time when I'm actually working. More about that later, no doubt. Secondly, I must insist that those few friends I have make lots of comments about my posts, otherwise I'm liable to think that no one cares about me. This will result in my curling up into a shrivelled little ball and blowing away in the wind, and you wouldn't want that, would you? You would? Oh.  Well, that's it for now. I must go and comment on  urlLink Megan's blog . Thanks for dropping in.     A rather rotund man sunning himself in Hyde Park, London, last week. He reminds me of a seal.

      ...I am still alive and well. By that I don't mean that I've been looking slightly cadaverous recently (though that may, also, be true), just that I've been working rather hard and have had no spare time to devote to my various online interests.  To ease any anxiety about my well-being, here is evidence of Mark and I having Sunday lunch in Cookham Dean at the weekend:     Argh! That shirt! Where on earth did he get it?   One of these days I'll get a photo of both of us in the same shot at the same time.  Thank you to Megan in America and Rein in Belgium for your comments, and a big wave to my cousin Elizabeth in Italy.   *waves*

      It's been another roastingly humid day here in Slough, leaving me little energy for anything other than pottering around online and lolling on the sofa, panting, with a cold beer. Usually I'm able to coax a refreshing breeze into my flat by opening both the bedroom and kitchen windows, situated at right angles to each other: the breeze blows in through one window and is sucked out via the other. Today, though, it's like sitting in a fan oven.  Thankfully the day, though hot, has been relatively quiet. It really is a pleasure to live in this top-floor end of cul-de-sac flat when the only noises to ruffle ones ears is the sound of the wind in the willows and the cooing of wood-pigeons plus the occasional roar of a Boeing 737 on its way to or from Heathrow Airport. It was ironic, then, that just as I was on the phone to [boyfriend]  urlLink Mark  a couple of hours ago remarking on how nice and quiet it was, the sound of revving engines started up outside. This was a sound I hadn't heard before, at least not this particular sort of high-pitched whine. Closer investigation revealed a couple of men in slacks playing with large remote control cars nearby. When I say  men  I mean that one was middle-aged and the other was well past that - perhaps father and son. What possesses grown men to play with toy cars well into adulthood? And what possesses them to think that it's okay to play with them immediately outside  someone else's  home? It's a mystery to me.  Still, no cars have been set on fire recently (the last one being the back end of an articulated lorry that someone foolishly left unattended for the night) and the last noisy gathering of fifty-odd Albanian refugees was two days ago on Friday evening. I won't say anything more about that now, as its liable to make me even hotter under the collar than I already am. Also on the plus side, I'm currently blessed with neighbours who are a good deal less noisy than some previous ones. Believe me, for that I'm  truly  thankful. Life is good. Sometimes.  One highlight of the day was locating my Blue Peter badge at the bottom of my jewellery box. Here it is...     I won this when I was perhaps ten years old in a Blue Peter competition in association with the National Portrait Gallery. For some reason I sent in a rather dark and moody pencil drawing of Jesus (as in Jesus Son of God) which won a runner-up prize - a nice letter from Blue Peter, a NPG bookmark, and the above badge. Rumour has it the badge allowed children into various museums and galleries for free but I never had the opportunity to put that to the test. Twenty-five years later, is it too late to try? Well, I guess many of those same museums and galleries are free now anyway.  Enough. I must do some invoicing.
