      So, in a couple of days I'm going to be driving up to Oregon... i have a few cd's in my car that have songs on them that i can imagine myself driving to. i know vaguely what the drive up there looks like... i've been to portland a handful of times, and i've flown most of those. there was that one time when we all headed up to the pacific nw in that enormous land yacht winnie... we pretended it was a pirate ship, and we really did pretend too. it was a big game of pretend, probably our last one, at least in some of our cases. when we left we had it parked on the asphalt outside of one of the crew's house... it was so hot that day that the asphalt was soft and when we turned the thing around as we were pulling out, ready to go, the wheels dug in and squished pavement out from under them like dough. it was then i realized why they have weight limits for residential streets. anyway, on that trip up i had a transmission-eye view of the drive up... i straddled the huge hump in the front of the 'Bago, next to the two seats in the cockpit. it's a beautiful drive, winding, carsickness-inducing, and i sat in the front for just that reason. i doubt i'll get carsick this time, although i'll probably cry some. i never feel alone in the car, just like i think i'd probably not feel alone in space, either. feelings and events and possibility are in the car with me, even if no other person is. there's nothing isolated about driving alone. it's almost like i'm an astronaut. if i were out in space in a capsule, Major Tom-style, i'd feel like i was directly in the presence of giants of unimaginable size-- all the planets right next to me, all of the suns and brown dwarfs and flowering supernovas. the buffer of earth and atmosphere would be removed and the distance would be closed... i can almost imagine the sense of closeness to that much mass, and i can almost imagine the awe. being in the car is kind of like that. it's probably one of the most nonsensical, drawn-out analogies i've ever made, and one of the reachiest, but it really holds... when i'm in the car, the space between me and all of the mass and particles and energy converging in my universe is removed. when i drive it's no longer time for theory. i can sense the most important stuff that can take place in a life like you can feel someone staring at you from across a room. you know it's there but you can't see it, and there's no doubt that the gravity of that look has you singled out. music just makes the whole experience more intense. it's like i'm playing out all these events or whatever, and i've got a soundtrack to it. i've got my little movie going, and it's all possible, and it's all at my fingertips, and my perception is it. the universe is supposed to be rotating. i think it's one of the projects of my life to percieve that rotation, just like when you're little you try and feel the speed that your body is travelling through space. they tell you how fast you're going because of the earth's rotation. you, as a kid, feel like you're sitting still. to process the huge discrepancy between these two truths (and they are both true) you try and feel in your body that immense speed. you can't, but you think you can. i guess that's how it is when i try and feel all of what is in my life. i can almost feel the future moving, quickening. i can't, of course, because regardless of what i tell myself existence happens one personal second at a time. i do love trying to create my own gravity though. sometimes it works. it has worked, in fact, quite well. but the result of that particular creative effort is an email address and a moniker that i now can't shake... Gravity. Gravity is born. yee-haw.

      The last time I was in Atlanta (or at least the last time it feels like I was in Atlanta-- I'm sure there were times after this) we went to this restaurant that sold real southern food. They had peach cobbler and collard greens and fried chicken and all that... I just remember the cobbler having a sugar crust and a pool of butter in the middle. There are few more perfect foods for an Emily: it was truly sugar heaven, that. I was with mom. Thinking about Atlanta brings back how her apartment smelled, how it was to lay and watch movies in our pj's while the sun was still shining in the summer evenings. TCBY with dad-- he always got peaches on his. I never understood. Why that when you could get a mound of candy? I get it now, although I thought all grownups were lying when they said that ultrasweet things don't appeal in the same way to adults as they do kids. Kids are high-octane. Chocolate syrup is in our veins instead of blood when we're littler kids, so rich and dark with oxygen and youth that to deny it a topping-off with Hersheys or taffy or whatever is like denying your new car an oil change. Or not. But all my memories of being a kid in Atlanta while mom was there are really this humid-aired, sweet series of snapshots and movie-clips . I learned to type on her pink velvet chair, and mom wiped my dad's computer's memory there while playing Oregon Trail  (oh, my, how the future turns somersaults). Everything was shades of girl in that apartment. The sheets were the softest sheets in the world. The bed was by far the most comfortable, and it still is, standing in my parents' guest room in LA. There was a pool, which gave me seizures of delight when I was ten. I remember cruising on the short flight back to Michigan in mom's sweater and a pair of her bermuda shorts, burned past the point of blistering from a day at that pool. I learned to float in that pool. The streets and the houses out near Buckhead were so beautiful, I vowed to grow up and get one. So elegant. Red doors. Not too big, with stands of oak and maple and dogwood all around. Yards. And why not?  Why not. Tomorrow Pres and I are flying to Georgia for a wedding, the wedding of his dear friend who shared a cabin in Alaska with him out in the bush, where they watched each others' beards grow and talked about chicks. I don't know about the chicks part, but the beard part is true. And that's all the speculation I can do.  I miss the humidity and the trees and the nice people of Atlanta. Portland offers up something very similar, though, and it's better here-- I have this new life, see, still wet on the wings.  The stalking continues. That's all I've got to say about it, really. What can I do? He's so very, very sorry, and that's the fucking problem. Steps will be taken. I'm exhausted by it.

      The red popsicles are my favorite. Red things are my favorite in general, in terms of snack items that called on to be dyed: red popsicles, the red Swedish Fish, Circus Peanuts (vile as they are, by god I love 'em), candy corn. I mention Red 40, and popsicles yet again because I'm drinking red soda now, and also because one of the most important parts of my day was the acquisition of more frozen treats. The other most important part: bought some books. A number of them. So, haha, read... red... yar yar yar. Puns are weak on paper. Anyway, I woke up late. Way late. Too late. Late enough that the contrast between the quiet and sort of cool house that I fell asleep in and the hellhole that I woke up in was painful. My neighbor forgave me for being cranky when I saw him today-- he rang the doorbell soon after I got home from the grocery store, and when I opened it up he grinned and sang, 'grocery boy!' with the fabulous delivery of a gay man who loves theatre. Which is what he is. He can pull off Vans sneakers and a wife-beater at age 35, and he's hilarious... at some point, if I ever get up the nerve to go and be spontaneously social, I should go visit him. As it was, he was visiting me because I'd left one of my bags of groceries on the sidewalk, and it'd been there for about fifteen minutes. He was sweet to grab it and bring it to me, and I'm glad he did. I wonder how long it'd be sitting there if he hadn't brought it to me. I wonder if I would have noticed it was gone. Probably not. Someone may or may not have taken it-- I'm not sure how much it would appeal to someone who just found it on the street. Soymilk. Cherry Cider, whatever the hell that is (it was cheap). A lone can of Amy's Lentil soup, which is organic, delicious, and sadly, not a pop-top. I imagine one of the guys over on 39th street that yell at traffic sitting on the curb in the tree-lined alley of our street, cursing the shortness of his fingernails and the amazing quality of the seal on the can. But oh well. Groceries intact.  It's amazing how a dirty linoleum floor can give the illusion of clutter and even crowding. Like, it seems that crusted brownie, stove juice, bits of rice and various smears can make the kitchen feel closed in and too small... these things take up nearly no space, and in order to make the grime spots themselves appear large, you have to get down on the floor and put your nose right up to them. Nevertheless, the kitchen floor of our little place resembled a slop trough until about an hour ago. Ok, so it didn't. But to me it did. Blech. Walking past it pained me. When I was younger, I was really good at being a mess and spreading my crap out everywhere-- oh, but did I love to clean small areas, and well. Compulsively well. I'm not claiming lifelong OCD here, but I think my early love for scrubbing grout was a harbinger to my present tendency to make sure porcelain, linoleum and chrome (and enamel, and vinyl or plastic of any kind) is clean. We have no mop, and no, mom, I've not yet gotten myself a Swiffer, so I ran hot water and wet the broom and went to town. We have a scrub brush, so I put on cut-offs and a tee shirt with The Simpsons on it and got down on my knees, making sure things were done right. The tee's synthetic so now I smell like a cow. Meh.  It's too hot for yoga tonight. It's hot yoga. The room is about 100 degrees, and you do yoga in it. It's great any time except when it's 90 outside as it is. I might keel over. So none of that. I need to iron tonight. Maybe I'll rent a movie. Maybe I'll try and write the novel which lives inside of me and occasionally comes up to wriggle just under the surface of my skin (very gross, looks like that worm thing from the X-files). Or it might be that cowardice and sloth will once again prevail, and I will find something else to clean or dither with or engross myself in, and another night will go by where 'I think I can' withers into 'I know I coulda' once again.  ::turns green::  I know a guy who says all the time, "i'm finally doing what I wanted to do since I was nine". Since I was nine. Since I was nine. When I was nine I wanted to be a doctor. That's what I wanted to be. Blood, guts, all good to me. More than that was the thrill of the minutae of the body and its conditions, and even more than that was getting to read medical encyclopedias all day. I changed my tune when I figured out that I wanted to be like my dad, and my dad was a lawyer. Then I learned that you could be both, and I wanted to do that. All the while having in the back of my head a list of what I was gonna do when I got my own classroom, and a group of kids to fill it. ::shrugs:: So I guess part of my fear doesn't hold, since I have been doing what knew I was gonna do when I was nine. But this guy-- he's 'That Guy'. He's that guy that's in his thirties and has no money but debt and has been with his partner for 11 years and is an artiste-- good at what he does but woefully unaware of how it is that he's fucking up his life by practicing his art like it's one of those islands in the Bahamas that you can buy. Like, he bought it, sold everything out for it, now he's living on it and living in his art Bahamas is great. There's nothing there but how lovely it is, though. He didn't ever figure out that you gotta make your art an enclave within the rest of your life. Otherwise your wife and your kids, or your girlfriend of eleven years, is gonna find themselves stuck with a person who just managed to get themselves born again... and how lonely is that, to be living with a time warp. I don't want to be that guy. I want to be Action Man. Action Man! So effective! So flexible! So free of cavities and callouses and blackheads! So caught up on his finances! So what if I'm aiming for the wrong gender! I'll be a superhero... I will write myself as anything I want. And eventually, if all goes well, I'll write everyone else that's inside of me too. That'll be the best.

      I find myself alone in the house we found in portland. Not alone, really. The cat's here. The computer's here. So in the morning I'll get up. I feed the cat. Feeding the cat is a great thing. It doesn't feel like very long ago that I never ever remembered to feed the cat, the fish, or anything else I was under childhood obligation to provide nourishment and attention to. I allow myself a little bit of wonder and happiness at the fact that I'm present enough to provide these things now. In the morning, I go into the kitchen and wash off yesterday's dish, and squeeze out out onto it some processed kitty food, the name of which nearly always includes the word 'tender' or 'niblet'. Mmmm. Niblet. Whitefish niblet... in sauce! How could I go wrong! Probably, in terms of marketing, the name of the cat food must appeal to the gourmand in the owner of the pet, not the pet himself.  The owner's gotta be persuaded somewhere in his mind to think, 'hm, that sounds like something that I could eat'. Then he buys it because it sounds good to him, and the cat chows down, and excretes, and eats, and the owner buys, cat eats, excretes, scratches the couch, etc. And on. It's a good cycle, one that I am happy to be an element of, partly because it makes me feel vaguely and quite pleasantly domestic. In the morning here in Portland, there's  Felis domesticus,  and there's  Emilius domesticus , feeding him. Basic duties are fulfilled and all is quiet, at least until the fellas at Big Daddy's BBQ open up the back doors and drag the griddles out. Preston ain't here, which is why it's just me and the cat and the computer. It's only the second night that he'll have been gone, and the house seems especially long and full of rooms; I've been walking through them in the dark on this hot hot evening, feeling sweat bead on my torso and run down my ribcage. It's effin' roasting. A popsicle diet seems just about right these last few days. I can see the rest of the week stretching out before me like a small house with a few round rooms that I've somehow been invited to stay in for a bit. It's like a pocket of time has opened up for me, wherein I am obligated to perform a few certain designated tasks that will dictate the comfort and success of my upcoming weeks. Things having to do with money and some dry-cleaning and some other stuff that escapes me now. A bit later lemonade will be made and lights will be turned on in the rooms, all of which have their own pile of crap that I've got to deal with. As I did last night, I'll haul my glass and pitcher of juice from room to room, trying to figure out how to focus enough to finish a task. Maybe I'm not  Emilius domesticus . Maybe I'm  Emilius sisyphus , finally finishing only to start again. Or rather more accurately, starting only to forget to finish again, and then finishing only to forget to start. Excellent.  A little while ago I talked to Pres on the phone; he's out in the great out-there, getting ready to learn to be a doctor. I'm a little familiar with what the place he's gone to is like, although I'm probably wrong on the actual details of the landscape and geography. All I really know of it is that it's dry and hot and high and sweeping, with some dirt and some water and just enough disenfranchised native Americans to make it sorta desperate. I like imagining him out there, doing stuff or whatever. He's kind of like a Land Rover, compact and adaptable to many conditions. Very dependable, but not stodgy. And pretty rare these days, his kind. Also, he seats four comfortably with excellent legroom, but that's neither here nor there-- comparing my boyfriend-lover-partner person to an overland vehicle has its downsides and inaccuracies. Mostly I imagine him like that right now because he's there and I'm here, and seeing him with metal flanks and side airbags and doors that lock makes me feel like he'll be protected. So be it that the armor is himself. That's kind of how he works.  My overalls are heavy. My tee-shirt's clammy. I've had...  ... I've had six popsicles. That's a helluva lot of popsicles. I keep imagining the Oregon winter, the heater purring. Out of necessity I'm huddling in a huge wool sweater, bright with christmas appliques. I don't own such a sweater. Somehow it fits with the image, though. And I'm not necessarily dreaming or idealizing. My silly polaroid-y instant cheer dreams of the winter to come allow me to accept the fact that I really have no idea how things will be.    It's like I'm trying to will myself out of the jinx of expectations by making up something grand and sweet, and then savoring it all the more because I'm aware that it is a confection of wishes.  I still think of myself as a kid somehow, even as I get up and shower and feed the aminal and get in my car and, miraculously, make it to work on time. Get there and write my name on the little squidgy whiteboard where we log our breaks. I'm a grown-up kid. I marvel at my ability to put the key to my car in the ignition. And it's not marvelling at MY ability... it's not like, oh me I'm so fine I'm so fine I blow my mind. It's being really happy that I live in a world where such things are possible, leetle tiny things like that, and that I get to do them. It all means so much. Tomorrow, let's see. What do I gotta do. I'll go to Stumptown, the best coffee place ever for reasons that I can't quite pinpoint... I yearn for my Classic Chai from Coffee Society in San Jose, and I miss the place up on the hill at Santa Cruz just in general. But this was the first place I got taken to, by Wommie in fact, that had decent chai at all. I cling to it now. They're very hip there. I'm not that hip. They're nice to me, though, and I need a place that I can go that I know I'll always like. So there I will go. And now, to bed with me. Not really, but the keyboard's all sticky from popsicle and I have to clean it.
