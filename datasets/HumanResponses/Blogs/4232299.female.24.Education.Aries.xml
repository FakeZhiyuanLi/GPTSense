      who play sports. I don't like boys who play fake sports on Playstation and then burp and blow it in my direction.  That's not hot. Get out of my apartment, please.

      that your sitting in a class called "History of the English Language" around 4:30 on a Wednesday afternoon. Sitting in front of you is a girl that you recognize from other classes.  All you really know about her is that her name is Meredith, and that she seems really smart and quiet. What's this? Meredith is passing you a note? She's probably asking a homework question...  "This image is happening RIGHT NOW! You stand up and start reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. This will be very well received. However, in the middle of your chant, grab my neck and conductor's ponytail [conductor was a non-traditional student who lamely worked at Casey Jones' restaurant] simultaneously and bash our skulls together. This may create chaos.  While we are on the ground in pain, run to the blackboard yelling "86 the final! 86 the final!" Then, draw an ejaculating penis on the board, moon the class, and flee!"

      ever just go to sleep for no other reason than they want the day to be over? I'm not tired, but today kind of sucked (besides winning $60). I'm done with it. I'll be happier tomorrow.

      I just got off the phone with him. He called to see how I did at the track. I told him I won some money and lost some money, and he says, "That's what the track's about. You win some, you lose some, but when you're there, at least you know you're alive."  Then, we started talking about my sister, Amy, who just came back from a Christian summer camp.  I decided it would be nice to let her borrow my car for the first weekend back. I'm not sure what this means, but my dad said, "I guess Jesus is her co-pilot, now."  What a weirdo.

      People from Lakewood are gross. Anyone want to disagree? This is coming from a girl from Keyport.  Speaking of Keyport, it has some awesome townies. My dad's practically one of them, so I'm dissing the townies or anything, just describing them. I worked in an antique market in the downtown area for three years, so I know them well.  First, I'll describe Shorty. I'm not sure if Shorty's a midget, but he's definitely black. He's like the black version of the grandpa from  King of the Hill . I think his knees might have been blown off in Korea or something. He's like 80 years old and always high and angry. Nothing he says is intelligible, though he was quite clear when he called me a white bitch because I accidentally cut him in line at the deli. He also told my boss that one of my co-workers was his girlfriend. She was 20 and hot and he was serious.  Then, there's this guy named John Benoit. I know his full name because he had to write it down for me because he's deaf and mute. He's also legally blind, but I think he can see a little bit because he wears glasses. He gets around pretty well with the use of his walking stick. John Benoit was a good guy. He came in one day and started taking pictures of me and my co-workers and then never came back. Sometimes I see him trying to cross a highway and flinch. Oh, I forgot to mention that he once gave me his TTY phone number.  There's this other guy that really creeps me out. I forget his name. I think my sister knows it. He has one eye and lives in a halfway house. He's always drunk and begs for money outside of the Cumberland Farms. I once saw him pick a cigarette butt off of the ground and smoke it.  The weird thing is, this guy has a girlfriend. They walk around town like zombies holding hands. I have to give her props -- she does try to take care of herself, but she, like her boyfriend, lives in the halfway house, so she naturally isn't very good at it. She's probably close to sixty years old, but always wears a teased side ponytail with a big bow wrapped around it, red lipstick, blue eyeshadow, and a very colorful unmatched outfit. I like to think her name is Sally and her boyfriend is Harry and they met in a very romantic-comedyesque fashion, but I doubt it.  OMG. Ronald. I have issues with Ronald. He, too, lives in the halfway house, but I can remember him being around since I was very, very young. The reason why I remember Ronald so vividly is that my dad used to tease me by saying that Ronald was my boyfriend. He walks everywhere, so when we'd pass him by, my dad would go, "Hey, Allison, there's your boyfriend," when I was like 4. It made me cry because, and I really believed this, Greg Brady was my boyfriend. Anyway, Ronald is 5'4, has shoe-polish black hair, coke-bottle glasses, velcro sneakers, and his posture is similar to that of Ed Grimley. He used to go into 7-11 to buy cold cuts and ask for a receipt. He is not my boyfriend. Never was. F U, Dad.  I saved the best for last. Julius, a.k.a. Sammy Davis, Jr. Where to begin? Well, he's an 80 lb. black man and rides a bike with a bell, for starters. On his dress down days, he wears a wig that must have once belonged to an Elvis impersonator. Really. It's tall and has side-burns; but, because he is black, he looks more like Sammy than Elvis, so we call him Sammy (but not to his face). However, on most days, Julius likes to dress as an American Indian. He wears all suede, and a full-on headdress with feathers, beads, and all. I could be mistaken, but I think he's from the halfway house, too. He likes to harass the fishermen at the bulkhead. Also, he'll dance if you give him a nickel.  I love Keyport. I'm not sassing. I really do.

      Darren and Frank won all of our money. Congratulations. Then, we played "Loaded Questions." No one technically won, but I like to think that in the end, we all won because we were rewarded with laughter and good times. Just some highlights: Vinny doesn't want to see Lance naked, Darren wouldn't like to have carnivorous balls, Vinny and Frank all business when it comes to making tree houses (Frank actually decided against having sluts), one feud that will never die is the one between John Wilkes Booth and Abe Lincoln, Mark doesn't want to see Jesus naked (although for me, I must admit that there is a difference between before crucifixion and after; I guess the same goes for before resurrection and after), and finally (although there are many, many more that I cannot remember so I'm relying on you guys to post them as comments) I will not sleep with Harriet Tubman, nor do I want to see her naked. The one thing I will rub butter on, however, is Ray.

      I've decided that I'm going to try and be nicer to people (specific people, not general people like non-traditional students), and that I'm definitely not going to write mean things about people I know in my blog. So, I'll let my friends do it for me. If you want an awesome description of Lance, please visit Darren's live journal:  urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/users/farbeyndhalford/ . I suggest you read the journal thoroughly as you will then come to realize the awesomeness that is Darren and your life will be complete.  If I'm lucky, a friend will write something about a boy names Sketch because I'm dying to and my new rules won't give me the flexibility to do so.  PS. Everyone needs to tell Ray that he should do a blog. He'll be mean and it's be great -- the greatest blog ever, that is!  PPS. I was typing "someone" and at first typed it as "somewon." My brain is awesome.

      10.  Kill Bill Vol's. 1 & 2  are awesome movies. 9.  The word "pubes" was loudly dropped about 50 times at Houlihan's. 8.  Darren said that Lance polishes his balls. 7.  Darren said that Lance was going to put his pubes in my pepper. 6.  Darren said that Lance parts his ball hair. 5.  Vinny imitated Lance parting his ball hair. 4.  Darren danced to Gloria Estefan. 3.  Darren, Katie, and I almost had to start our own civilization as we were almost trapped in Vinny's fold-away couch. 2. Darren took out his balls and Katie didn't notice for about a minute and a half. 1. We made Ray "tsk" about 300 times.

      are probably about the circumference of....something round and small. Sorry I couldn't think of anything. Anyway, he comes into the living room and says, "Allithon, geth what?" I say, "What?" already knowing that what is about to come out of his mouth is going to be great. "My legths are three different colorth -- brown, white, and red." He lifts up his shorts to expose his pale thigh, points to it and says, "white." He then points to his tanned calf and says "brown." I say, "and red?" to which he points to a mosquito bite and says, "red," with a very satisfied smirk. I think he might have meant it to be a joke or to show that he is clever, but I really didn't know what to say. I came up with "that's great Ben," but he didn't leave. So, I added "I got nothin' on that, though." I guess he didn't like that because he quickly changed subjects: "Can I have a pudding?"

        Dear Jack:     I am sitting in a bar on Market St.  I'm drunk, well, not quite, but I soon will be.  I am here for 2 reasons; I must wait 5 hours for the bus to Denver & lastly but, most importantly, I'm here (drinking) because, of course, because of a woman &amp;  what a  woman!   To be chronological about it:      I was sitting on the bus when it took on more passengers at Indianapolis, Indiana -- a perfectly proportioned beautiful, intellectual, passionate, personification of Venus De Milo asked me if the seat beside me was  taken!!! I gulped, (I'm drunk) gargled & stammered NO! (Paradox of  expression, after all, how can one stammer No!!?)  She sat -- I sweated -- She started to speak, I knew it would be generalities, so to tempt her I remained silent.      She (her name Patricia) got on the bus at 8 PM (Dark!) I didn't speak  until 10 PM -- in the intervening 2 hours I not only of course, determined to make her, but, how to  DO IT .      I naturally can't quote the conversation verbally, however, I shall attempt to give you the gist of it from 10 PM to 2 AM.      Without the slightest preliminaries of objective remarks (what's your  name? where are you going? etc.) I plunged into a completely knowing,  completely subjective, personal &amp; so to speak "penetrating her core" way of speech; to be shorter (since I'm getting unable to write) by 2  AM I had her swearing eternal love, complete subjectivity to me &  immediate satisfaction.  I, anticipating even more pleasure, wouldn't  allow her to blow me on the bus, instead we played, as they say, with each other.      Knowing her supremely perfect being was completely mine (when I'm more coherent, I'll tell you her complete history &amp; psychological reason for loving me) I could concieve of no obstacle to my satisfaction, well "the best laid plans of mice & men go astray" and my nemesis was her sister,  the bitch.      Pat had told me her reason for going to St. Louis was to see her sister; she had wired her to meet her at the depot.  So, to get rid of the sister,  we peeked around the depot when we arrived at St. Louis at 4 AM to see if she (her sister) was present.  If not, Pat would claim her suitcase, change  clothes in the rest room & she and I proceed to a hotel room for a night (years?) of perfect bliss.  The sister was not in sight, so She (not the capital) claimed her bag &amp; retired to the toilet to change ---- long dash  ----      This next paragraph must, of necessity, be written completely objectively  --      Edith (her sister) & Patricia (my love) walked out of the pisshouse hand in hand (I shan't describe my emotions).  It seems Edith (bah) arrived at the bus depot early &amp; while waiting for Patricia, feeling sleepy, retired  to the head to sleep on a sofa.  That's why Pat & I didn't see her.     My desperate efforts to free Pat from Edith failed, even Pat's terror &amp;  slave-like feeling toward her rebelled enough to state she must see  "someone" & would meet Edith later,  all  failed.  Edith was wise;  she saw what was happening between Pat & I.      Well, to summarize: Pat &amp; I stood in the depot (in plain sight of the sister) & pushing up to one another, vowed to never love again &amp; then I  took the bus to Kansas City & Pat went home, meekly, with her dominating sister.  Alas, alas ----      In complete (try &amp; share my feeling) dejection, I sat, as the bus  progressed toward Kansas City.  At Columbia, Mo. a young (19) completely passive (my meat)  virgin  got on & shared my seat ... In my dejection over losing Pat, the perfect, I decided to sit on the bus (behind the driver) in broad daylight &amp; seduce her, from 10:30 AM to 2:30 PM I talked.  When I  was done, she (confused, her entire life upset, metaphysically amazed at  me, passionate in her immaturity) called her folks in Kansas City, & went with me to a park (it was just getting dark) &amp; I banged her; I screwed as never  before; all my pent up emotion finding release in this young virgin (& she  was) who is, by the way, a  school teacher!   Imagine, she's had 2 years of Mo. St. Teacher's College &amp; now teaches Jr. High School.  (I'm  beyond thinking straightly).      I'm going to stop writing.  Oh, yes, to free myself for a moment from my emotions, you must read 'Dead Souls' parts of it (in which  Gogol shows his insight) are quite like you.      I'll elaborate further later (probably?) but at the moment I'm drunk and happy (after all, I'm free of Patricia already, due to the young virgin.   I have no name for her.  At the happy note of Les Young's 'jumping at  Mesners' (which I'm hearing) I close till later.        To my Brother  Carry On!  N.L. Cassady

       She wrote: "And finally I read all of   Allison Bolte's blog  ,  (which is only like 8 entries,) and I've decided it's got good stories, the same  way I've got good stories and Darren's got good stories. So if you're into good  stories writen by awesome people (like me) I suggest you check out Allison's  blog. She's Amy Bolte's sister, why not. Also, I once sat on her basketball  jersey in 1996 and she has just recently fogiven me."  And, props to Darren for saying that my blog was tight. Sorry I didn't use live journal, though. I think this one is pretty cool.

      suck. For those of you who are lucky enough not to know what non-traditional students are, they are those students who are sitting in the front row of class, nodding their heads, raising thier hands to make obvious statements, and laughing at the teacher's stupid jokes. In other words, they're old. They make the normal college-aged student's life miserable. First of all, what is up with the bookbags on wheels?   Secondly, why do they all act as though they have a personal relationship with the teacher? Just because they're as old, if not older, doesn't mean that the professor cares about thier kids or dogs. And, why do they feel the need to ask pointless questions at the end of a fellow classmate's presentation? Usually, that question can be put into one of two categories: irrelevant or redundant; one broader category into which irrevelant and redundant questions can be placed is irritating. Why do they always try to go above and beyond above and beyond? Why write a 15-page paper when the professor asks for ten? Why do they make an informal verbal article summary into a power point presentation (with grammatical, spelling, and technical errors that they do not see or know to correct)? Why read every book on the recommended reading list and then ask a question about one of the books on it in class when it's pretty much guaranteed that no one else in the class read it? Please, just shut up.

      I just got off the phone with Meredith and felt compelled to dedicate a blog entry to her. I'm going to describe how and why our friendship works. We see eye-to-eye on many things; it's almost like a sixth sense. This is evident through our many flawless partnerships in the game of pictionary. Dare to challenge us, sukas. Also, we have an understanding that if we have plans with each other and either of us gets a date or the chance to hang out with whomever our boyfriend happens to be at the time, those plans are cancelled, no quesitons asked (except "you gettin' laid?") and no hard feelings. We agree to disagree about many things, but always agree to make fun of whatever it is about which we are disagreeing -- these days it usually has something to do with a jack-o-lantern. She can tell me anything, and I won't tell anyone else, and I can tell her anything, and she'll tell her whole family, but I don't care. Our friendship started at the passing of a dirty note in class, so naturally there is no taboo topic between the two of us. There are things I wish I didn't know about her, as I'm sure there are things that she wished she didn't know about me. That said, I'm not sure why she just told me that she found a chunk of something blue on her neck and another in her hair. Still, it made me snort. That's how Meredith and I do.

      I went home today to give my little sister driving lessons -- good job, Missy -- and in the ten-minute encounter with my dad, he managed to make my week. First of all, today he's wearing this tie-dyed Grateful Dead t-shirt, blue shorts, and no shoes, so the soles of his feet are pretty much black. He was talking to my Uncle Mike on the phone so loudly that you could hear him outside. It pissed my mom off, but I thought it was awesome. So, he finally got off the phone and joined my mom, my sister, and me in the den. Automatically, my parents began to bicker about the pork chops that he had boiling in sauerkraut (ew). Once that was over, I hear my dad ask my mom, "what are you looking at?" My mom replied, "I'm looking at the cat that's sitting behind your head." My dad's response was "Oh, God forbid you ever look at me." Classic. My mom is having cataract surgery Thursday morning, so I asked if she is going to have to wear an eye patch. When she informed us that she would, my dad's face lit up. He makes fun of everyone and delights when he finds an opportunity to do so. My mom was like, "John, no pirate jokes. Don't you dare." His response: "Aye, matey."  My dad's kind of an asshole, but, a lovable asshole.

      to write about my kitchen table. I put it together early Sunday morning in between Kacey's 3am text-message fight with some skank and the onset of the second-to-worst hangover ever. It's quite a nice table, if I do say so myself; however, there is a slight problem with the chairs. The sitting part of the chairs does not attach to the frame. Is it feasible to glue it? Is it weird that I read this back to myself in a southern belle accent? I'm guessing the answers are respectively no and yes, but I'd appreciate anyone's help with the chairs.

      I'm starting a blog. Why? Because I'm bored.  Because I want to go to the basketball court and it's raining. Because I haven't decided what to read next. Because my apartment is too clean to clean again.  The other day, my 8-year-old cousin Ben told me that I was his favorite cousin because I'm cool and a teenager.  Later that day, he told me that African-Americans used to be called *whisper* black people.  When he grows up, he's going to be an actor, singer, football player, and now, like me, a teacher. Good luck with that, Ben. He slept over that night, and asked me for an ice cream sundae at 7 am.  I told him to have some Apple Jacks, which he did, but then ate an entire package to Reese's Swoops and a box of Milk Duds.  At 11, he wanted lunch, so I made him frozen pizza. He had an ice cream sundae for dessert. He's 60 pounds and has a six-pack at the age of 8.  I think if I had the choice to come back after I die as anything I wanted, I'd be Ben. Ben rocks.
