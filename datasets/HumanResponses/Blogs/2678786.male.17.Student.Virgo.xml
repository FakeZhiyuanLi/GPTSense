       I think I've zeroed in on the passage from Al Franken's book that most positively affected me in the direction towards liberalism. I'll quote (and cite-I don't want to get in trouble(it's not illegal if you dont try to make money off it, is it?)) it: "We love America just as much as [conservatives] do. But in a different way. You see, they love America the way a four-year-old loves her mommy. Liberals love America like grown-ups. To a four-year-old, everything Mommy does is wonderful and anyone who criticizes Mommy is bad. Grown-up love means actually understanding what you love, taking the good with the bad, and helping your loved one grow. Love takes attention and work and is the best thing in the world.      That's why we liberals want America to do the right thing. We know America is the hope of the world, and we love it and want it to do well. We also want it to do good." (Al Franken,  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right  (Dutton, 2003), 24)      This passage articulated for me the difference between conservatives and liberals that I had felt before reading this. (Warning:disclaimer coming) This is not to say that I completely agree with Al Franken or that I actually believe that all conservatives are like "four-year-olds." Rather it just helped me to understand what being a liberal means for me. I hope I have not seriously offended those friends of mine who lean to the right, but I felt that I needed to elaborate some on last night's comments.

       so in my first blog ever, I mentioned an urge to do what other people around you are doing (basically to want to be involved in fads and even fashion). wow, it's amazing to think back over all of the fads that I got involved in (some good/some "bad"(ie not worthwhile)) I'll try to list the major or most memorable ones. The first thing I remember claiming as a favorite anything is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (and rightly so), but I don't believe other kids influenced me into liking them. The next that I can remember is Power Rangers. Agh. That was not beneficial. It was a rather uncool (compared to tmnt) show from the start, and now that it has been rehashed so many times... The only reason I got involved with the power rangers was because of the hype over it at school. Everyone else seemed to be watching it, and I had never heard of it before. I had picture some sort of western cowboy theme before i actually got the chance to see the show. and once I discovered my misinterpretation of the name, I readily dismissed the fact and accepted the show as my new favorite because my friends liked it. simply because they did, i did. next came star wars cards. now those were cool. and they still are. i plan to keep them as collectors items, but more just for my personal enjoyment (yes, I am a fan of Star Wars (but not the newer ones, not really)) everyone around me was also interested in the star wars cards, but so was I, genuinely. then came yomega yoyos. those were fun, until my classmates perverted it by trying to rent their own yoyos out to make a profit off the fad themselves. then pokemon. this was the first time i was able to step back and watch myself fall into the fad. it was a waste of money, and it was a waste of time. but all of my friends were doing it. and the profit seekers were their, too. my best card got stolen by a kid in the neighborhood (i was unbelievably gullible and trusting in that moment as a result of trying to look cool with my collection of cards). then came scooters. I got one. I rode it around for maybe a week. now it just sits in my basement. I probably wont use it again, unless I get a job at Google or some awesome work place like that. I cant think of more recent big fads, but they are probably everywhere in highschool, and I'm probably constantly falling for them. oh, heres one. i joined the circus club and asked for and received a diabolo for christmas. its pretty much the same idea as the yomega yoyo before. it is a really cool toy, but the only reason i wanted one was because other people in the circus club already had them.      I guess all of this is a rant (however mild in form) against capitalism and materialism. our country's economy is powered by the desires of children and adult children for stuff and the peer pressure that spreads those desires around, which I think is rather sick. money can be used for corruption so easily that it is often immediately associated with evil, which is not always the case. money can be used for good. i just cant think of any good examples right now.

       I just started to read the Al Franken book, Lies and the Lying Liars who tell them. I believe just reading the first 10 or so chapters somehow had a significant effect on me (of which im not yet sure whether the effect is positive or negative). On my website, under the politics heading, I formerly proclaimed myself to be moderately liberal, which, I felt, adequately represented my views. Upon beginning to read the book, I developed the urge to delete the word "moderately", which I have just done. Somehow, by reading the book, I was pushed over the edge to clearly see that I am, in fact, rather liberal instead of only moderately liberal. I feel, as a result, as though I am suddenly more confident, my opinions are much stronger or more solid. I feel like I have a knot of energy in the middle of my chest. I believe all of this is because I just also clearly defined an enemy,  the conservatives . I do not wish to create enemies. Doing so is a fault derived from original sin and is against true human nature. I have many conservative friends, and I don't want to suddenly only see them as conservative enemies or opponents. Somehow, I need to be able to be comfortable with my views (especially when they are strongly liberal) and not judge those around me because of differing views. I think just stating that helps.

            so im at a kind of interesting place in my life right now. I'm smack dab in the middle of my junior year, kind of the prime time of the high school experience. I'm doing pretty well in all my classes (I hope). I've got so many great friends (plenty for an introvert like me), none of which influence me negatively (or to be more optimistic, all have an overall positive influence on me-thanks guys!). I'm very blessed with my family: two parents that love me and each other very much and support me so much, and a brother that, in one word, hugs. Continuing with the family theme, I have three living grandparents who are also very loving and supporting (and, giving a shout out to Mawmaw and Pawpaw (even though they'll never read this), also very wacky), and I know that my grandpa is rooting for me from heaven, too. On top of all this familial bliss, there are still three aunts (well, one "great"-aunt;-), all three amazing women who are an important part of my life. and then, and this seems trivial (which, I suppose, it is), but as far as material possessions, there is little left that I really want (at least at this point in my life). I can't help but think of the proverb or saying or cliche, "to whom much is given, much is expected". From this point in my life, it seems to me, the possibilities are infinite. everything is possible. which to me is a little frightening (something like when school children are at recess-if there is a fence around the yard, they run to all corners of the yard, but if there is no fence, they stay close to the school). Since my possibilities appear to be limitless, I, of course, am led to think about God, the limitless. I've been watching Joan of Arcadia (friday nights, ch 4, 7pm, watch it...or tape it), in which God is basically giving Joan orders to follow (well, not orders of course...more like firm suggestions), and wonderful and mysterious things happen when she follows them. the show has opened my eyes to an aspect of God that I hadn't fully given thought to. Joan wasn't really religious before God started talking to her, and now that he has, Joan still doesn't go to church or anything like that, but rather simply goes along with Gods suggestions as they come. and then I think about my own actions, how my relationship with God works. yes, first off, I go to church. and youth group. outside of led activities, I'd say I pray every other night or so, and random times throughout the week. I've tried to develop my personality and behavior based on my Christian faith. but most of the time, I'd have to say that I'm not directly focused on God or God's will for me. sure I've kind of programmed myself for a kind of piety for God that, I'm afraid to say, in part, is for show. I mean, I think about mass, especially when I serve, especially the bowing, and the clothes. I mean, when I bow to the alter, I'm doing it more for respect of the rituals of the mass celebration than I am consciously thinking, I respect/revere/love you God.  which i do (respect/revere/love), but that isn't how I would chose to show it. given my personality, I would prefer to simply think it. ok, so in the context of a community that has come together to celebrate the mass, public actions of otherwise internal ongoings are appropriate and called for, but I want such actions to be meaningful, and for me, if an action is going to be meaningful, it has to be my own, I need to own it, create it, give it, much like my mom does through her liturgical dance.       while talking about the mass, and the Church in general, hierarchies don't sit well with me. I'm fine with leaders, we need leaders, but leaders shouldn't be elevated to a class above the group of followers (which I'm not saying is the situation with all priest/congregation relationships, or even my own priest/congregation relationship or is the official view of the Church). when I think of Pope JPII (who is a wonderful leader and not someone who elevates himself above us, in my opinion(a little note right here, now that I see how this blog is turning out: all of this is my developing opinion which is apt to develop further as my understanding of the world, and specifically the Church, increases)), I automatically picture a hierarchal pyramid of the church, with the pope at the top and the laity at the bottom, suggesting, in my mind, a greater degree of closeness to God as one goes up the pyramid, which is certainly true in certain instances, but definitely not in every instance. now, nothing has directly provided me with this portrait of the hierarchy of the church, but it developed somehow. (another side note: seeing, again, how this is developing, I think I might just be trying to justify to God why I don't want to become a priest, if that be my vocation) oh, and I have mixed opinions about women becoming priests. To be honest, I'm totally for it (if God gave some women the tools required to be priest(-esses?), why would God not give them the privlege(?-right?) to be one, but, if I follow the church's reasoning properly, this is what trips me up: so priests are like Jesus' apostles, but His apostles were all men, but if I dismiss that because it would be counter-cultural for Jesus to have women apostles in His time, I then have to remember that being counter-cultural never slowed Jesus down, so there has to be some other reason why he didn't have women apostles, but what? so right now I have questions about God and the possible set roles of men and women (yes, I realize men and women are different, but different shouldn't mean unequal opportunities in my book) let's see, do I have any other issues I want to discuss about the church? (if you haven't realized it yet, I finally figured out what opinions to write about(if confused, see below), and I got tired of waiting for you to respond to my request(but the request still stands!)) oh, here's one. yeah, homosexuality: I mostly agree with the church (which basically says that homosexuals are to be respected and loved just like anyone else but the homosexual act is sinful and the state of being homosexual is a disordered state. that last part about being disordered is what troubles me. I don't know how to change it, but if I happened to be a homosexual Catholic, I would not want to be called disordered. I don't know. anyway, that's enough about the church.      so back to just me and God. so practically, if rituals such as those required while serving don't do it for me (i.e. get me closer to God), what ways can I explore to genuinely get in touch with God's will for me? what I've seem to have gathered as I've grown up is that, mostly, God doesn't talk to us directly as He (for lack of a better pronoun-I should try to alternate He with She, or should I just stick with God (but that makes for awkward sentences), ooo, maybe we can come up with a special pronoun just for God, like... ok I can't think of anything that doesn't sound ridiculous) does with Joan, but rather, we're supposed to kind of follow our instincts that we are to interpret as either hints from God or just our own desires (obviously following the hints from God;-) I don't know. what I really desire is a dynamic, immanent, personal, in-your-face, no piety (the type described above) cr*p, type of relationship with God (basically what Joan's got)      alright, so what have I accomplished in this journal. so I dislike the apparent divide that exists between the laity and the priesthood and would rather stay on this side. so now that  I  decide to get married some day instead of being open to becoming a priest, ignoring God's will, one way or the other, I want to have a closer relationship with God in which Her will is readily available to me. hmmm, contradiction? I think I need to stop trying to make things happen and go listen to God for a while.

       so while im waiting for people to, first, realize that I have a blog, and second, respond to my request for editorial topics, I guess I'll continue to journal. so yeah, here it goes. I've been able to spend a lot of time online lately because of a break from school because I just finished exams (a 5 day weekend to be exact), so I've been able to improve and fine tune  urlLink my webpage  to the point where I can't look at it anymore but am glad that other people might have the chance to enjoy it. I had been brainstorming ideas of how to improve it, resulting in the newly added "goals/dreams/aspirations" section under "personal info", but next I wanted to add a section devoted to my opinions on topics. I felt that a catagory of such size could not work in the format my webpage is currently in, not to mention the cumbersome process I need to go through in order to edit my page. Then last night/morning I remembered looking at the blogger site a couple weeks/months ago and thought that it would be cool to use that too. hey, its free like geocities, and a lot more conducive to the type of thing I was trying to do: post my opinions and thoughts as they come up. the only drawback/negative difference there is with blogging instead of using my webpage is that the opinions will be rather disorganized and randomly ordered because they will be presented in chronological order. I may be wrong, but i think that is one option that you cant control on blogger (overall, I'm very impressed with blogger. its very easy to use and very customizable, given a certain level of computer literacy) but I'll have to live with it, for now (or once I actually have opinions in my blog).

       Alright. I think I got a handle on how this thing works (or at least how I can use it). Well, as stated above, this blog's purpose is to present my thoughts, opinions, and journals to the world. Well I'm gonna have to put the ball in your court. I need topics to discuss. Maybe it's just the mood I'm in, but I can't think of anything worthwhile to give my thoughts or opinions on. Journals on the other hand are pretty easy. I could call this right here a journal and that would be fine. In fact I'm going to go title this "Journal" right now. That was easy. Anyway, I need your help. I hereby proclaim that upon reading this journal, you are personally obligated to  urlLink email me  with a topic that you would like to see me comment on/give thought to/formulate an opinion about. I thank you in advance for contributing to this blog. I hope to hear from you soon!

       So this is my first blog ever. I just felt the urge to join the craze that seems to be popping up all over the web. Maybe I'll talk about that type of urge later. Well, right now I guess I'm just seeing how this works. I'll come back later to do more.

       so ive had to start thinking about college. I've got 7 in mind right now. They are Washington University, Boston College, Fordham, St. Louis University, Loyola Chicago, Franciscan University, and Truman. I've kinda covered all the bases. I've got one I know that I can absolutely get into and is wonderfully affordable (costs less than high school), Truman. I am obviously very biased towards Jesuit colleges. I admittedly am pretty much only interested in Franciscan because so many of my friends are planning to go there. I've got some close to home, some far. And I've got my two highly competitive schools to try for. I actually have a chance of getting into BC, but I doubt my chances with Wash U.(two periods or one?) (or I could just say that the sentence isn't over yet and end it now). I also am taking into consideration that my 1818 credit is only good in the midwest (i think-i dont know about Fordham or Steubie, but BC definitely doesn't, neither does Wash U). But I will have AP, too, and thats good almost everywhere, so...a more important factor is whether or not to be close to home. which also relates to the cost-both tuition and travel expenses. I'm hoping to not have to pay anything for college through scholarships though (not just the big ones, the small ones add up!) On the one hand, I'm really close to my family, and I want to be around my grandparents as much as possible, but on the other hand, the idea of being in a completely new big city is very exciting. comfort, familiarity, and security vs. adventure, opportunity, and, well, fear. It would be rather unsettling to not be able to go back home within 20 minutes or even a couple hours, to have such a big barrier between me and my family, the kind that has only happened before for very brief periods of time. and this would be months at a time without being able to hug. but of course, such circumstances would probably only force me to spread my wings a little farther a little faster than I would otherwise. it could possibly help me to grow, to expand my horizons more than in a city that I already know and surrounded by people that I'm already comfortable with. I guess thats all I have to say for now, but I'll still be thinking about this. I'll write more when my thinking progresses. Advice is always welcome.

       Well, I've been thinking a lot lately (and by lately I mean all of my teenage years) about the future, specifically, what I will be doing in the future. I have also been trying to live in the moment/"now", but I'm gonna have to put that goal aside for this blog. The main debate going on inside my head is the tension between my will and having no clue how to figure out God's will. I've grown up always wanting to do God's wil, but I've always been fuzzy on the details about how I would actually know what to do. And this is becoming very apparent in this period of my life in which I have to think about senior year, college, majors, jobs/careers, and yes, even relationships. (sigh) When it has come time to make decisions like senior courses and what colleges to look at, it has felt like I'm completely relying on what I think is best for me. I'm not sure how to consult God on such decisions. Is it just a matter of using my reason (a gift from God) as best as possible? That cannot be because the limited nature of the human mind could not even start to realize the complexity and majesty of God's plans to work through us. So I guess I'm just venting my frustration at what I really need to do, listen. I happen to consider myself a good listener, but that may be because I surround myself with people who talk...a lot (namely, my mom, but many, many others as well-you know who you are! and I love ya for it!). But I don't think God is going to talk to me in a similar manner. Patience and trust. Those are the two things I think I need to effectively listen to God. I guess what I'm really thinking about is vocation. What is God calling me to do? to be? How am I to best serve God? By being a preist? married? deacon? brother? single? I've already stated what my preference is (marriage, if you didn't know), which I would think is everyone's natural inclination. So I want to know how a priest realized his calling and how he accepted it. If any priests read this, please email me. and if any people with other vocations read this want to impart some wisdom, please email me as well. (but I dont think anyone reads this blog anyway-email me if you do, please!!! just so I know) cause when I picture the possibility of being a priest I visualize (falsely I'm sure) a rather lonely life, and what happens to those romantic feelings? I'm not sure if this means anything, but just talking about this topic makes me yearn for a married life. and kids! It would be wonderful to be a stay at home dad. at least half of the time. that would be my ideal situation. to be married. to have, oh I don't know, maybe four kids, to have a job that I love, but allows me to be a stay at home dad half the time, and for my wife to have the same. that would be awesome! but none of that could possibly come about if it wasn't because I had been open to God's will and had been led to that situation. ahhhh, the uncertainty of the future! this is where the trust come in. and the benefit of only living in the moment (the present moment is all we ever actually have anyway). so i guess i better snap back into reality and start listening.

       So I decided to take personality tests online to find a new way to describe "me." So my first results said that I was an ISFJ, with the percent of preference for each one being as follows: Introvert-89% (what a surprise!), Sensing-1% (so really im an X for this one), Feeling-22%, and Judging-11%. Personally, I think I'm more of a Intuitive than a sensing so I'm going to call myself a INFJ instead. I also think that I used to be more of a Judging, but now I think I've relaxed into Perception. so now Im a INFP. But im trying to become a J again. At least with regards to school. Being a J is useful in school, and my grades have suffered as a result of P-ing. Of course none of this means anything because im not completely grown up yet. But still it helps me analyze how and why I do the things I do. Here are descriptions of the different combinations listed above. All are pretty much only partial descriptors of different areas of me.  urlLink Protector (ISFJ).  urlLink Counselor (INFJ).  urlLink Composer (ISFP).  urlLink Healer (INFP).  If you want to take the test, click  urlLink here . And to interpret the results, click  urlLink here .

       with thinking about colleges, ive also been thinking about majors. its kinda an important part of the whole college experience. to focus your efforts to learn an area of knowledge in which you can excel the most. and with my personal strengths and preferences in mind, i was thinking about something like philosophy or religion. but then i realized that im not really interested in learning all the different types of philosophy and how they are used or all the rituals and doctrines that come with religion. as much as i enjoy thinking about complex things, im not really interested in being an intellectual. in thinking for the sake of thinking. when i think about those complicated issues, its so that i can understand the issue, take a particular position on that issue, and then act on my new understanding and opinion on that issue with regards to relating to other people. despite my introvertedness which makes my relating with other people slightly awkward (at least for myself), i have a drive to relate, to connect, to apply what i have thought about to how i live. so with regards to my major, i need something that will allow me to grow in my capacity to think intelligently but also direct my application of the results of my thinking toward my relating to people. and above any of this is the intense desire for whatever i do to have some positive impact on those people with whom im relating. to work, in broad terms, towards a greater world, to bring God's kingdom to earth. i guess philosophy and religion can do that. but i dont like to concentrate so much on specifics and details. i like the big picture. so i get stuck when trying to process all the details. such detail arent the type of thing i enjoy thinking about. i guess i dont really know enough about how philosophy and religion majors work to be making these judgements, so i'll stop making them for now. but these are the things im thinking about with regards to majors.

       so ive been running for track for four weeks now. and im pretty tired. ive been improving, but it is still a lot of hard work. at the beginning of the season i considered not joining the team because of the amount of work involved. but i decided i would be glad later if i did run. and i am. but it got me thinking what the purpose is of sports. or any activity where you practice everyday to get better at it (so this includes school too). the immediate benefit for me with running is that it keeps me healthy. it also gives me a sense of achievement. like after a hard workout, ill be so tired, but ill feel so good. the endorphins i guess (another definite plus). ill feel that ive conquered the workout, like a mini mount everest. it is something that i have done that has made me stronger. it has become part of my foundation, and from that new height, i can reach for the next goal. to improve myself more. is that the goal of all of this? i suppose. to develop ourselves to our full potential. to completely utilize and appreciate God's gifts to us. by this, my running can be a spiritual exercise. to improve myself in order to better glorify God, to better serve God. but this is only my human effort to improve myself. in order to fully glorify God, i need to allow God to work in me and through me. sports are great to improve yourself so far as you can do on your own, but to reach your full potential as a human, you must rely on the supernatural. so i guess im just trying to realize that sports, while great, can not be used to reach the goal but can only be a supplement. while i must continue to work to improve myself, i must go beyond that and let God take a turn at directing my life. it sounds simple enough. but ive already talked about my difficulties in doing that. so this is just another blog with the same ending. i think God might be trying to talk to me through my writing. i need to let God lead.

       For this Lent, I gave up meat. not just for Fridays like all Catholics but every day (even Sundays). I am strongly considering making this a permanent change to my diet. Yes, I want to become vegetarian. Ideally (ie, if I wasnt so lazy), I would take the next step and become vegan. And the reason is (and yes it's a little cliched) that I love animals. I do not want to cause animals pain or suffering for my benefit. Some time during my sophomore year, there was a showing of a documentary at my school that showed the conditions in which food producing animals live and die. I wont go into any detail, but it is terrible. I still have images burned into my mind. Immediately after watching this (this was a completely optional thing to go see), I did not want to eat meat. But my family is carnivorous, and, as I stated before, I can be rather lazy, so I gradually went back to being ok with eating meat. I was only able to do this by ignoring what I believe to be my conscience which says that this is wrong. I view eating meat as almost a social sin now. a problem that all of society is contributing to. Being called to be stewards of the earth and knowing how these animals are treated, I cant justify eating meat to myself.  Even before I had seen the video, I had observed and thought it strange how we can love and protect some animals, like dogs, being disgusted when other cultures eat dogs, but then go on and eat cows and pigs and chickens. why do dogs deserved to be respected more as God's creatures than these other animals? We even name the meat different from the animal for cows and pigs, I think trying to "de-animalize" them, or giving them a status below animal. And very few of us like to think about the details of preparing the meat. Even as a carnivore, I could have never been a butcher because it seems so violent. I suppose this is one way in which I want to act out my pacifism (if that isnt a contradiction). As one of my friends (hi katie!) pointed out, there are vegetarians who want to push there beliefs on others. I'm not doing that. If you want my opinion or want to understand my beliefs, you can certainly ask me, but I will not (or at least try to not) judge anyone for a difference in beliefs (this is a principle applied to all differences in beliefs, ideally. but hey, guess what, I'm an idealistic kind of guy!) a wonderful site that pretty well fully explains what im talking about can be found by clicking  urlLink here . so my goal (if one is needed) in becoming vegetarian is, first, just practically, to have my actions aligned with my conscience. and more broadly, i suppose there is a hope of a vegan society that would bring harmony in nature, or God's Creation. so i hope there is some sort of greater understanding of why I want to be vegetarian now. if not, feel free to question me further.

       a vocation is a calling by God, leading one to live her or his life as perfectly planned by God. so as a man, there are several possibilities. I will either marry, enter the religious life, or remain single. i cant ever imaging remaining single outside of the context of religious life, so i wont discuss it here. i just recently was able for the first time to envision myself as a priest. and to be good at it. or to feel comfortable with that vocation. after successfully imagining the possibility, i feel that i am more open to it, should i feel called. and that is where im leaving that option. ive decided not to stress over it. i can pray about it, but i wont rack my heart about whether i should make a decision. if i am called to be a priest, i'll know. the graduating seniors from sluh that are entering the seminary talked about the persistent nudging that God was using to call them. the nudging that they were resisting and then finally gave into. it sounds like i'll realize clearly if God is calling me. so not until that happens will i continue to think about that option. i said before religious life, but i cant see myself as a monk. i dont agree with the monastic lifestyle because it removes the person from society, almost selfishly abandoning society instead of working to bring God more fully into that society. i am also considering the vocation of deacon. especially the variety that is allowed to marry. because obviously my preference is still to marry. and here is where patience comes in. and why patience is in the title of this blog. and why its the word i need to keep reciting to myself. its not that i would like to get married tomorrow. its that i would like to have a romantic relationship tomorrow. and for most of society, that is obviously accepted and practiced. but that hasnt always been the case. if you think back before the 1960s (or maybe earlier) their wasnt any such thing as dating. only courtship. in which the aim is marriage. and this is the problem of today. and my problem. any romantic relationship at my age would be starting something that i cant finish. not for a long long time. sure in three months (and 5 days), i could legally marry, but im talking practically. the practicality that says that i have at least 5 more years of school ahead of me, that i dont have a job, that i still have more growing up to do. so thats why i need to have patience. to be able to appreciate the season of singlehood that im currently called to. its in this season that i A)fully mature and 2)focus completely my attention on serving God. these are both goals to which i should redirect the romantic energy currently bottled up inside of me. so with the situation analyzed as such, my only problem is struggling with infatuation-causing hormones. which with God's strength, i should be able to be successful at, most of the time. because i think i can trust God to be guiding me to the vocation in which i will be happiest. and in marriage, to bring me to the woman for me. honestly, its a very difficult stage in my life, to feel like im just waiting around until im finally ready to consider marriage, and having to constantly guard myself against the temptation of intimacy without commitment. this is the most immanent problem im facing right now. how can one stop having a romantic interest in another person in order to try to grow in a friendship that isnt distracted by such feelings?  i'll be praying about this. i would be grateful for your prayers as well.

       I just thought I would give an update on how my vegetarian lifestyle and vegan goals were going. well, im still vegetarian, obviously. and I definitely have a much much much (yes, thats three muches) healthier diet now. for breakfast i normally have total raisin bran with Silk brand vanilla flavored soy milk. the total ensures im not missing out on any essential vitamins. even though i prolly have it covered with the other healthy foods i eat. lunch. well im in a rut. but its a yummy rut. i have a pbj on wheat. and then two granola bars. both made by nature valley, who are vegan friendly. and in the late afternoon, i have a whole series of snacking, sometimes taking hours to complete as i lazily veg out (pun intended) in front of the tv. this snacking routine starts with a banana. i like my bananas with green stems. i dont like very sweet (aka mushy) bananas. then i have nuts. planters deluxe mixed. i reeeeally like almonds. and then i go for some (well, a lot) of raisins. and sometimes i have those peanut butter sandwich crackers. the lance brand is vegan friendly, too. then i finish with an apple. fugi, to be precise. and once in a while i make myself a sandwich out of wheat pita bread, hummus, and alfalfa sprouts. i also like sun chips. cuz their multi-grain. then dinner is always different. and it is also almost always not vegan friendly. but im choosing to not stress over what i eat. im limiting where i can. yet i still indulge in ted drewes. oh well. oh but just last night i tried my first soy ice cream. and i liked it. so yay. but still, i realize. its ted drewes that we're talking about. i dont know, we'll see.  im also trying to limit the leather that i use where possible. and so far that means that i have a cloth belt. and a couple days ago i made myself a duct tape wallet. which is fun and cool, even without its vegan friendliness. ha, i just realized that im saying vegan friendly. which is directly against the popular term, atkins-friendly. to which i cringe when i hear. oh, i also had my first vegan hamburger a little while ago. and it felt strange eating it. i dont know that i even want to eat things that are supposed to taste like meat. its not very appetizing to me.  so that is how im doing. thanks for supporting me, or at least letting me be, as i continue to explore this significant lifestyle choice.

       Hi. So I kinda took a small break from writing in my blog. I apologize to all of my faithful readers. But I'm back now. Cuz it's summer. And I'm really quite happy. Because of all of the free time. So now I'm blogging again. And by now I mean 1:30 am. Cuz who wants to blog during the day? I mean, hello, you could be sleeping then. So I'll get on with my blog. My topic of discussion for today is activism. Because I would like to be active. Not just any kind of active though. Active with a purpose. I want to be a rebel with a cause. Because not having a cause doesnt make much sense to me. So im rebeling against rebels without causes too. But continuing... So the first thing to be active about is nuclear disarmament. Because  urlLink blowing each other up  is not a good thing.(warning: link rated R for language) Peace is good. So even though the cold war is over, we should still work to get rid of OUR WMDs. try setting a good example? How about the idea that other nations only try to get nuclear weapons to defend themselves from the threat WE pose. And going right along with that, I want to activly oppose war. While I have been taught the Just War theory in school, I still dont see how entering into war could ever be justified. Jesus' whole deal was to not resist evil because that is exactly how evil wins. when we resist, its kinda like when we react to someone who is annoying you. If you act annoyed, they annoy more. the annoyness grows. i think it works the same with evil. I realize that in our world not resisting evil means we die. just as it led to Jesus' death. But it also leads to resurrection and heaven. so pacifism rocks! so yes, I would like to fight for peace...by working for justice. Next on the list is abortion. I'm not sure how liberals can claim that being pro-choice is a liberal thing when right now its the law. being pro-life is an expression of liberalism because the law needs to be CHANGED. as in, NOT conserved. so im not sure how pro-life is a conservative thing either, but thats ok...i can agree with the right on one thing at least. this is basically the reason for my independentness as far as political parties go. no political party can contain my views. the main point of conflict being life. a rather important point. cuz im both against abortion and the death penalty. reason im against abortion: thou shall not kill. pretty clear to me. reason im against the death penalty: kinda the same idea as with war. and with abortion. no human is allowed to take the life of another human under any circumstances. again, pretty clear to me. Everything else that I want to be active about is a variation of problems with equality. I want to protest  urlLink sweatshops , racism, sexism, sexual orientation discrimination, and religious discrimination. Also, I would like to work towards the end of homelessness, hunger, and poverty. especially for children and the elderly. Also I want to work for justice in education and health care. like maybe our gov could spend 86 billion on teaching our kids and healing our sick. why in the world do we not have federal health care? Oh, and I forgot to say something before that isn't exactly about equality. animal rights of course. I mean its sort of about equality, as i've discussed before: eating chickens but not cats. and no, byrne (a fellow classmate), the solution is not to start eating cats too. Just a little side note: I despise the Atkins diet. It looks to me (jokingly) like a government plot to spur on the meat and dairy industries in their capitalist goals. I've only known one person that has taken up the Atkins diet, so it doesn't seem to be that popular to me, but its everywhere. Stores are supplying the supposed demand for low carb foods, and i guess its spurring on the craze. People! carbs are good! balance is the answer, not cholesterol filled meat and dairy!!! so yes, I hope to become vegan someday. when i said balance before (just for clarification) I meant a balance between carbs and protein, not carbs and meat. there's a difference. especially for me. ok, end of "little side note." and along the same lines as animal rights is activism for the environment. I want to hug trees. as stewards of the earth, we dont have permission to ravage it but rather tend it. so thats a lot to be active about. at this point, theres some little things that I can do. like being vegetarian. I would also like to ride a bike or bus instead of a car. outside of animal and environmental rights, I can vote. soon. and you can bet i will. and i can also volunteer for orgs that work to accomplish the things ive discussed. and i can also peacefully protest. so there you go. those are the things i would like to be active about. If you think of something that you think I probably overlooked, please comment.

       I came across a quote while surfing that really got me thinking about my attitudes about peace and how I should go about my activism. so watch out; block quote coming your way...  'A man of peace is not a pacifist, a man of peace is simply a pool of silence. He pulsates a new kind of energy into the world, he sings a new song. He lives in a totally new way his very way of live is that of grace, that of prayer, that of compassion. Whomsoever he touches, he creates more love-energy. The man of peace is creative. He is not against war, because to be against anything is to be at war. He is not against war, he simply understands why war exists. And out of that understanding he becomes peaceful. Only when there are many people who are pools of peace, silence, understanding, will the war disappear.'OSHO, from: 'Zen: The Path of Paradox, vol II'  After reading that, I realized how ironic it is to say that I want to "fight for peace" (a quote from my activism post). So peace is not something to fight for but rather to live out for myself. As the anonymous person who commented after my activism post said, the best way to change the world for the better is to change myself for the better ("World Transformation thru Self Transformation"). I'm already on that path, but now I have the right attitude to go along with it.

       so in my last post about college, I stated a whole bunch of practical reasons why SLU would be the best school for me. it is good for the school that I want to attend to be the practical choice, but I don't think that just because it would be easiest for me to go to SLU (because of distance from home and cost) is a good enough reason to go there. But with having settled for the moment on SLU, I decided to do more research into what special programs are offered, and I discovered that SLU was not only practical, I was the school for me. This research I speak of is of the program called Micah House. Its basis is to connect all the areas of a student's life and direct it towards community service. Totally awesome. If you remember back to my post about majors and not feeling satisfied with the idea of a theology major, it was because I wanted what I would study to have a very practical application. I wanted it to be very clear to me how the ideas I would be learning could be immediately applied to affecting the community for the better. This is definitely what I was searching for. It is not a major; it may go along with my major of theology or education (or whatever is needed to be a theology teacher). The members of the program live together on campus, they take some of their classes together, and they serve together (30 hours per semester). It's all of the good parts of a fraternity with none of the bad. Not only will I still be able to go ahead with the theology major while participating in this program, but I will also still be able to work towards the honors degree. And while Micah House is a tight-knit group, they still encourage you to be active in any other areas of campus life that you are interested in (so it's not like it will dominate my college life). This program has single-handedly sold me on going to SLU. I've already started to fill out the application. Other school don't hardly appeal to me any more. And I don't anticipate my enthusiasm fading. I realize that there is a whole lot of time left before any final decisions have to be made (a lot of time to change my mind), but, honestly, this  is  what I have been looking for. And now I've found it.  "What does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?" Micah 6:8

       just wanted to share an interesting site i found via surfing (actually from  urlLink another blog  that i like to read). the site is a  urlLink political compass  quiz that measures and describes your political views not only economically (left and right) but also socially (libertarian and authoritarian). i scored about a -3.00/-3.00, which you will understand if you take the test. but basically it measure the degrees to which i am left and libertarian. this puts me somewhere close to gandhi in political views as the site shows. there is another site with a shorter quiz  urlLink here . it puts me in the category of a centrist, but leaning towards the left and libertarian side. ok, that is all for now. cuz its late. grrr.

       i have now visited all the colleges that im currently considering. first off, thanks to my family for making the trip happen. we flew out to providence, RI, where we picked up our one way rental car. drove up to boston: boston college. drove thru fordham in new york (saw statue of liberty and ground zero as well). walked around franciscan u. of steubenville. visited loyola chicago. and finally marquette in milwalkee. i had already visited slu and wash u back during spring break. i really liked bc except for its distance from home. frankie u. would be great spiritually, but it's too conservative for me. loyola and fordham are too urban for me. marquette is a lot like slu. so right now, slu is my first choice, bc is second, and marquette third. i stopped considering wash u bc its not jesuit (mission of education not directed by spiritual goals). and truman is a good school, but same prob as wash u plus not in a city. so slu is my top choice right now because it is in st. louis. i am so connected to st. louis with the people that i love being here. my well being is somewhat reliant on being with people that i love. slu is obviously jesuit. something that has apparently become my main criterium for my college search. i have a great chance at receiving lots of financial aid from slu. the college credit that i have earned is accepted by slu. my favorite color is blue. these are a good number of reasons why slu is my first choice right now. just a sidenote: while my home is only 5 minutes from the campus, i would be planning to live on campus (its part of the college experience). and hopefully with financial aid, it will not be unnecessary money spent on my part. during this trip, ive had ample time to think about things, and for a major, im thinking education with the intent of teaching high school theology. cuz at first i was thinking about the priesthood and homilies and that led me to consider the fact that im probably more able to teach in front of kids than preach in front of adults. so im excited about that thought. the other thing i like to think about as a career is to work at karen house. its part of the catholic worker movement (dorothy day and all) its houses families while they get back on their feet. and the people who run it also live there with the families. it is an awesome way to live out my drive to work for social justice. and to live out a life of physical poverty. the people who run it have very few possessions. their lives are very simple. that is definitely a goal of mine. to simplify my life. less is more. if i empty myself of possessions, God can fill me with grace. that said, i often feel like a hypocrit for wanting to buy things. my bday is coming up, and my family likes to know what i want in the way of gifts. so i have this list in my mind, and these items are completely unnecessary in the long run. the items themselves are contradictory. some are to have brand name things and some are to fight against brand names. ahhhhhh. ok, i'll make this clearer by telling you my list. its short, dont worry. ok, aviator sunglasses. to look cool basically. something i dont normally care about and dont want to start caring about. the next is teva sandals (brand name alert) the idea is to have sandals that arent leather. but i can get unleather sandals at target. i guess my idea was that they would last for a long long time. but my original reason was because i liked the way they looked. so its a cool thing again. ug. my third is the antibrand name item. converse style sneakers that are made by unionized factories (not the converse brand) thats at  urlLink www.nosweatapparel.com . but again, my desire for the shoes is not only to have them union made but also for the style. so after writing about it, i think the shoes would still be worthwhile purchases. and if i ever come across aviatiors that are cheap, there is no harm in having style in the spirit of fun. sigh. the material world sure does complicate things though. ok, well i started out talking about colleges and i took a tangent over this way. the tangent ended, so i think this blog is done.

       so this blog is kind of belated. cuz it stems from Steubenville, which happened at the beginning of July. oh well. hopefully i can remember all that i wanted to say. so the theme of the youth conference (aka steub) was rise up: a catholic revolution. they had a military spin on it, but its a good theme anyway. because i definitely do want to rise up. especially in the way described in the comment that follows my "active" blog below (thank you for the wonderful comment, person i dont personally know). so i was just wanting to describe what i learned at the conference. first off there is the image of God's people all&nbsp;focused on God. God at the center, and the people in a circle around. and this way we are able to see each other face to face. but when we turn away from God, we can only see each other from the side.  the rest of what i learned came from Ralph Poyo, a speaker at the conference. i actually ended up hearing him speak 3 times. if he was talking, i was there. so anyway, my big revelation was that to defeat my sin, i have to bring it into the light. because a no on my own often does not work. but with the support of the people around me, sin doesnt stand a chance. so practically applied, this basically means confessing my sins to my friends like i do in the sacrament of reconciliation. which is a very scary thing to do. but Ralph Poyo shared his  dark  secrets with the whole conference, continuing to bring it into the  light  (and inspiring others to do the same, obviously...just like my youth group's current motto of inspire greatness). so i think i can tell my close friends. i already have been able to open up with a few friends, and it is incredibly freeing. especially with the accountability that my friends provide. thank you to the friends that i have already shared with. you are amazing friends. very accepting and supportive. and if i haven't opened up to a close friend who happens to be reading this, i hopefully will be able to soon. trying to build momentum. overcoming fear is a hard thing. fear of taking off a mask and not being accepted for what is underneath (a lesson given a long time ago at my REAP retreat for confirmation that i can now live out). oh, another thing i picked up somewhere around the conference (im thinking on the ride back home...), mediocrity is death. i cannot settle. i have to always be striving for more. at my jesuit school, its called magis. latin for more. but anyway. to not be mediocre is to be extreme. to stand out. to go against the flow of society. to speak up and defend what i believe. especially when its my friends that are being mediocre themselves. this is definitely a way to improve my life. (improve life=closer to God) so what im working on currently to extremely change my own behavior (and maybe inspire others;-) is to stop watching the majority of tv/movies. and to get to bed much earlier and wake up much earlier. this last idea is from the book  Don't sweat the small stuff...and it's all small stuff.  this is very much against what im currently practicing. i still haven't gotten to really try it out, but i will be. and basically the benefit of this apparently crazy idea is that in the morning, i'll have time for myself before i have to worry about any demands the world has for me. it would be time to pray, meditate, read, run, watch the sunrise. it sounds awesome to me. i dont know how i can possibly do it though when my social life doesnt usually start until about 9pm. prolly right when my plan would have me go to sleep. (and wake up prolly at 5am...the person in the book wakes up between 3 and 4 each morning...i know...crazy...extreme...revolutionary?) and i dont know how i could possibly do this during the school year, especially during cross country season when i cant even start my 3 hours of homework til 7. however, not watching tv will definitely help. this would be as life changing as becoming vegetarian, so it may take a while to implement, but i'll be working on it. well maybe tomorrow night. cuz im definitely not doing it tonight! tata for now...

       I haven't blogged in a while. and this isn't an apology. I blog when I am moved to blog. I've been distracted and busy lately so I haven't had much chance for movement. but i think im finally moved now, so im going with it. it's 2:13am and i'm pretty tired. but im going with it. so while i've been distracted and busy, or more specifically: this past week, I've been thinking about love. it may have started a while back (three weeks ago) when i watched moulin rouge and realized that I could be a part of the bohemian revolution (or revowution. whichever you prefer), but my thoughts on love have intensified in this past week (to the point of movement, obviously). so first i'll just state some preliminary thoughts/beliefs i've gathered in my 17 years about the mystery of love. love is not a feeling. happiness is a feeling. it often accompanies love, but not always. instead, love is an action, a verb. it is the perfect method of relating to fellow humans. love is selfless and sacrificing, making the recipient of your love the priority. and love does not worry whether the same is returned. so basically, im just paraphrasing corinthians 13:4-8. hey, thats worthy of a block quote (its not like i dont have all morning). love is patient. love is kind. it is not jealous. love is not pompous, it is not inflated. it is not rude, it does not seek its own interests, it is not quick-tempered, it does not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth. it bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. love never fails. that's an action-packed word if i ever saw one. so obviously, God is Love. and God loves me. in that love, God created me and gave me free will to love God back. that's what heaven is: to be in complete unison with God through love. well, thats half of it. in our free will, i am also called to love the Creator's Creation. all of it. not just the parts that benefit me or that like me, but the whole (insert favorite cliche here). And in heaven, God and all of Creation (including me) will be in unison through love. (not unlike the buddhist concept of nirvana) so how about now. before heaven. between being created and being in heaven is the time slot reserved for my life in this physical universe. (not to bother with the worrisome details and specifics of what exactly the process is of being received into heaven. thats a mystery to be lived, not anticipated) so this life is my opportunity to love God with my free will. and Creation. all of it. but i will never experience all of God's Creation in my lifetime. and love is an intimate behavior. thats a source of some of my thoughts right there. how to love all of creation without ever even meeting most of it til heaven. my answer (to my own question) is that it is a matter of attitude and faith. that all i can do is love the creation i encounter as best i can  (attitude), trusting that i would be able to do the same with the rest of it (faith). in reflecting, i see that heaven is a complete love. love, on my part and while in this universe, is incomplete. i love parts of creation more than others. i love humans more than i love plants because i have more in common with humans. thats another question: can love (my human attempt to love) actually have different degrees or intensities? i'll save typing and assume for now that the answer is yes. (knowing that assuming is bad for obvious word splicing reasons) so love of different degrees is the reality in this imperfect world. but it is not the goal. complete love (heaven) is the goal. and my life should be used by coming as close to that goal as possible. so say i observe myself loving one person more than another. i want to see how i love that person more and increase my love for the other person in the same manner. this of course has boundaries such as marriage, but if there are ways to increase my love for another person, i need to try to do that. this is very idealistic of me, but none of this love can depend on the other person or their actions regarding me. i must love indiscriminately and recklessly. God (aka love) is my first priority (redundant?) in increasing my love. Creation second. me third. yeah, im still in there as a recipient of my love. i need to increase love for myself too. but way too often, i switch that priority paradigm to have me on top and God on bottom. i might even say most of the time. and that is because i judge priority with my level of intimacy to whatever it is that im focusing on. and simply because God is not physically next to me, i often dont focus or pay enough attention to God. since i hopefully know myself best (of the people i know, i mean. God knows me perfectly), I often put priority on my needs/wants, being most intimate with those needs and wants. then putting the people around me as second priority because i feel more intimate with their wants and needs than Gods will. in the past few months i have tried to use this as a way to become more intimate with God. to become closer to God by becoming closer to other people. it is not a bad thing to do at all, but it cannot be the only thing. because i can become easily distracted with these people and lose any focus on God and any energy to be directed towards loving God goes only to the people around me and to me. (i realize im being awfully hard on myself. this is not the intent. it is only a process of reflecting and resetting my attitudes and behaviors) so if judging priority by intimacy does not work, the judgement must be made by level of commitment. obviously my foremost commitment should be to God and to the doing of God's will to most fully love Creation. and my second commitment to creation. to love it as God will's me to. and my third to myself because i only need commit myself to doing the first two things. but within the second commitment to creation-again, it is an unevenly distributed commitment in my humanness. the most obvious example is if i were to marry, i'd have a stronger commitment to my wife than to a close friend, quite logically. it seems i'd be called to love my wife most among humans, being a part of me. what then of increasing my universal love? its hard for me to wrap my mind around these expansive ideas and im quite tired (being 3:56am) so i'll stop that point there. but basically, i'm realizing that all i have to do is increase love and the rest is details. i suppose the details are important and apparently someone once said that God is in the details. but ive never liked focusing on the details. even though thats probably all that i ever do. nitpicking about vocations and such. as my yg sang in our PL skit-all you need is love.
