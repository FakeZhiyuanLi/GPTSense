      Newt's message made me think of this, so I'll share:  You can  urlLink make posts via email  with blogger.  So in theory, you can be getting your mud punched and tell us about it at the same time.

      Yes, I am a gay homo.  But this email from everyone's favorite Korean is just too good to ignore.  From May 7, 2004  hahahahaha,   Yo, I just got out of jail!  I got the green jumpers and my own cell.  I was charged with 1st degree burglery and 2nd degree assult.  My girl friend called the cops after an argument.  The cops thought i broke into her house and try to rape her.  All this a week before deployment.  Fucked up week.  I had scratch marks all over my neck and bruises on the face.  The tough guys in jail asked what happened to me and I said,"My girl friend kicked my ass and I ended up in jail."  They all tried to console me and said, "Yeah, that shit happened to me too."  But after looking at my case, they decided to drop the case and let me go.  I'm now going on deployment right after I get out of jail.  I guess it wont be a huge change.   Hope you guys are doing well.  Maybe this shit will end up in SHIPMATE too.  To newt's comment, yup, submarines suck dick.  My girl friend broke up because i was an alcoholic and I'm still chugging vodka!  Deathhouse and highschool chicks!  -DONGHWA PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPAK    You'll all be glad to know that the felony charges against Donger were droppped.  Don't know about the rest of them.  Beat Army, Sir!

      Here's a cheery message from Newt.  Looks like people are having a hard time figuring out what this website is for.  Hello to everyone,   I hope you are all leading wonderful and fulfilling lives, I know I am.  So as most of you know, I am in the Navy and in the Navy there are ships (including Satan's own personal creation: Submarines), and as if the mere existence of ships wasn't bad enough, sometimes they go away from land for extended periods of time, and sometimes really fat telly-tubby looking men called executive officers, who hate the idea of other people's happiness decide that everyone they work with is not quite miserable enough and may need a couple extra months of pain, and then other people called admirals decide that this is a great idea and take a submarine whose hull "expires" and deserves to be ripped apart, shat on and sold for scrap, and keep it out underneath the ocean for a bit longer, and this causes everyone else debate the merits of drinking bleach.  Not that this applies to me, of course.  But at some time in the near future I will be sporting the high-n-tight/moustache combo, which in conjunction with my underway specs(plebe summer issue geekers) will finally get me the respect I deserve. Anyways, for those of you who didn't quite follow all of that and I think that's pretty much all of you, the USS Honolulu is about to set sail to do "God's Work" for almost half a year.  Where Team Hono is going, I cannot say.  But I will say that the Hono Warriors will be visiting most of the dirtiest ports the Pacific Ocean has to offer, so I should at least have some good stories if not diseases.  While I'm gone growing older and greyer, I will not be able to access my Hotmail account, so you'll have to write to me at newtonbl@honolulu.navy.mil. It might take a couple weeks, but eventually after two or three people have read and possibly censored your email, I'll get it. And then I'll respond and eventually after two or three people have read and possilby censored my email, you'll get my response. And don't worry if you get some message saying that some of the stuff you wrote was deleted, I'm pretty sure that's bullshit.  But please write since I'll have almost no contact with actual human beings for a few months.  And by actual human beings I mean people neither in the Navy nor the oldest of the world's professions.  Alright my friends, that's all I've got but please keep in touch and pour some fruity drinks out for me while I'm gone. Pangarap, keep the dream alive.   BNewt

      Guys, I just got back from my first patrol, and man, I dont know what in the hell you guys are talking about...this navy stuff is awesome, I mean, aside from taking three minute showers for a month, sleeping like three hours a day, and not really getting any sort of general respect from anyone on board, I mean, its not so bad...and all this, not gonna do a DH tour? come on now...lets just keep our options open, and not base our decisions on just one run, ok, just because you are feeling overtasked and underappreciated and when you see your department heads getting bent over on a daily basis, dont make any hasty decisions...anyways, enough about work, lets be honest, seriously enough right now, if the three of us are putting shit up on this message board, we are probably at home and that is ok, since we are not at sea, which is pretty ok....keep things in perspective...you could have a nice date with your stinky 9-man tonight...Jeff...that story...ridiculous...enough said.  hope all is well..take care fellas  Tony

      Apt description of sub vols, submitted by DJ RoRo.  Who's getting out in five?  seven?  I figure I'll take the free shore tour to shorten my sea tour and get my tapeworm business off the ground.

      Guess who gets to go to sea again in a week?  This guy!  Yesss!  Yessss!  Yesssss!!!  Apparently, a carrier battle group needs to do a pre-deployment certification.  We will be the sub for the workup, even though we won't actually be going on deployment.  Makes sense to me.  I guess that's a good thing though, because according to my Engineer, "You'll be working really hard in port, but going to sea will be your reward."  Oh that makes sense, because that way we get to be combat warriors on the tip of the spear instead of being able to go home at night and enjoy time with loved ones and trying to have a life.  Gotta love the people who decided to stay in.  Fags.

      Greetings, all.  Hopefully each and every one of you is experiencing the rush that comes along with being a submariner.  I have exciting news from Brian Rowe down in King's Bay.  After pulling in following a patrol, one of the guys from his boat went home only to find that seven dudes were running a train on his wife.  This unfortunate sailor was also shocked to discover that his spouse had also converted their lovely piece of base housing into a meth lab, and had killed their 4 month unborn child by snorting crack.  Oh my God!  How awful!  Did this guy kill himself?  Did he kill his wife?  No, no, no, my fellow seamen.  He did far better than that.  After much pleading from his wife, he told her that he would regain her trust IF she let him and his friends run a train on her...because that's the obvious answer, right?  So our hero heads to the ship, brings five of his comrades back home, and they proceed to devastate our lucky lady with Rocco Siffredi-style dehumanizing animal sex.  After wiping his dick off, this fine young sailor calls his wife a whore and then files for divorce.  Honor...courage...commitment...a submariner craves not these things.  So anyway, I got promoted to the rank of Leftanant Junior Grade today.  Exciting stuff.  Apparently my captain found out that I have a tattoo of a price tag for ten grand on my back.  I bet he'll like me even more now.  Fair winds and following seas, Jeff

      Here are some of the questions I was expecting to receive pertaining to this weblog:   How do I log on? Can I post pictures? What is your favorite kind of cheese?   Here is the question that I got, over and over again:   Who invited Pelar?   Well, it goes like this:   It was a dark and stormy night.   Pelar calls me and says he needs a place to stay for a week or so -- he has TAD orders to the Parche to work on forward quals.  Against my better judgment (mind you, I'm coked up at the time), I say he can stay here for a couple or ten days.  That was almost Two Months Ago.  Instead of going out for six months and being in port for a week, the Parche's got it ass-backwards.  So, since March Pee-pee's being eating all my food, watching all my TV and getting on all of my wife's nerves.  And complaining about it.  I've been spending my nights down at the Parche, helping them fix stuff so they can get the fuck to sea.  Now I have  Sturgeon-class submarine trim pump repair experience  to put on my resume.  In summary, I had to forward Pelar the e-mail.  I have to be nice to him.  He gets home before me every day.  He could change the locks.

      That is your cue to send me an email ( urlLink csdoney@hotmail.com ) or call me ((803)370-4142) so I can set you up with an account.  Hurry up, I go underway soon.  But I can't tell you when.  It's classified.  By the way, that picture is of Ken Rahn (SW) at Wild Wing with some escaped zoo animal.  He's staring it down to establish dominance over his territory.  He's also singing a Stroke 9 song, probably because he's a big pussy.  Just kidding Ken, you know I love your little black backpack.  Later, 'bators.

      First things, you know, first.  Congratulations on your well-deserved promotions -- you have set yourselves apart from your peers and obviously impressed your superiors in attaining the rank of Gay-G.  Don't spend it all in one place.  Second things second.  Welcome to our website.  Surprisingly enough, computer nerd as I may be, I've no website-making experience.  Perhaps those of us with solar-car-racing and web-authoring abilities will be able to lend a helping hand.  Also surprising is that there is no porn on it yet.  I'm sure Szwarc has some good anal footage from his first underway.  Figure out how to put it on this site, you big, beautiful homosexual, you.  I digress.  What I was trying to say was that, (if I can figure out how to work it) this site will be a means for us to share tales of humping under the polar ice cap, Bar Mitzvahs in Waikiki, Klan Rallies in King's Bay, and other vagaries 'round the globe.  I'm not particularly interested in what you faggots are doing, but maybe someone is.  Anyway, I'm going to figure out how to work this thing.  I'll get back to you.  I love you.

      Here's more from Newt, concerning everyone's favorite redheaded stepchild.  fellow inmates at lower security prisons,  how are things?  hopefully you are all doing better than i am, although at least i have alms to keep me company.  last night he told everyone at dinner why he chose submarines over eod.  i will summarize:  he spent some time with an eod unit and watched them take x-rays of bombs and then put other bombs next to them to blow them up.  using his electrical engineering background(greg), he noticed that they were putting the bombs in the wrong place and told the unit xo that they were "doing it all wrong."  the xo challenged him to do a better job and so place the bomb in the correct position and it did the job.  then he decided to prove his point to the unit by spending three days building a bomb with triple redundancy and multiple power sources, etc, etc, and challenged the unit to disarm it...  after three team members died(simulated of course), the xo asked him how to diffuse the bomb to which alms replied, "it cannot be done."    it was awesome.  he is the fucking man.  dave, you are crazy for not hanging out with him. i especially like to watch him dry hump the periscope.s yesterday we saw a merchant and it was totally tits.  keep living the good life while i gain all the glory. peace out.  bnewt

      Well shipmates, I got back from another sea voyage, and I have nothing to say except that I want to stab my eyes out with chopsticks. Here's a message from Newt.  hello all,  just a little update since it might be some time until the next one:  two weeks done - many more to go.  phase two is complete- it's like i have a playboy model's pubic hair(racing stripe, if you will) on the top of my head. getting any higher or any tigher just isn't possible.� for those of you who may have forgotten, phase one was geekers(plebe summer issue glasses) and phase three(moustache cultivation) is currently in progress.� with each passing day the xo hates me more and it is amazing.�   i spent a couple days in japan - didn't really get to see much, especially after winning a t-shirt at a bar called geronimos.� there were some shots involved and a girl with a kid and a moustache. that's about all i know, but i'm sure it was totally sweet.   i've seen alms naked several times and in udt shorts twice, which are going to be great mental images to have in my head while he is my engineering officer of the watch under instruction.� on a brighter note, everyone and i mean everyone hates him.� there are post-it notes throughout the boat with Dragons Suck written on them and just about everyone has read and enjoyed the email dubose sent about him.� our entire boat thanks the uss buffalo for lending him to us.�   we had four midshipmen riding us for a week-� despite our best efforts, some of them actually still wanted to go subs.� we tried to buy one a prostitute while we were walking around on the streets in japan but he ran away screaming. i don't think we got out money back but it was very funny.�    that's about it for now.� thanks for all the emails, your pity is most appreciated.� alright, it's time to go hide.� peace  bn

      Ahoy, Mateys!  I'm sitting alone in my living room with a laptop and a bottle of sangria that I'm about to kill an empty bottle of red cab because the Navy has been so good to me.  I leave thursday, Elaine gets back on the 12th, and I get back on the 21st, which is also the day that she goes back to sea.  The best thing is, I didn't even plan it this way.  The Navy did it all for me without me even asking!  Thanks, guys!  So anyway, i pick up the midshipmen that are coming with us, and these guys are HERBS!  I told them that subs suck because you work all the damn time, and this one dude is like, "Well, at Cornell, I work 20 hour days, and I like to eliminate all the superfluous things like TV and video games.  It's not like I date a lot or go to bars, and If I'm not working, I don't know what to do with myself."  It took all of my strength to keep from throttling his chicken neck and shitting on his choade.  This is the same guy who hopes to join the Cornell Hybrid-electric car team next year.  Either that or the team that designs a car that runs off of vegetable oil.  What a queer.

      howdy all,  last night alms told us the story about the calculator that could do 7th order integrals and it was totally sweet.  everyone on the boat loves him, which should make dave very happy.  sometimes when he is in maneuvering, people will pick up random 2jv headsets and scream, "rahgh, i'm a dragon, rargh," or "dragons like anal sex."  we call these dragon bombs and they are good.  everyone on the boat knows about his religious beliefs and enjoys making his life hell.  the buffalo needs him back.  anyways, the main reason i am writing is to tell you that we have decided to form a team hono Mary Kate and Ashley Fan club.  dan is the president and i am thee vice president and we are trying to get as many members as possible. we are going to write them letters and send them off at our next port.  hopefully, mary kate will be out of rehab or have just recently binged at taco bell, so they will be able to write us back.  the only problem is that we don't have an address to write to them. we need to know how we can get in touch with them. that's where you guys come in.  i am hoping that in your free time when you are not drinking your pain away, you could help us out.  we would really appreciate it and it's pretty much the only thing that will keep us alive.  alright dudes, that's all for now.  i am really doing great work out here.  have fun and enjoy your careers. greg, enjoy virtual canada.  bnewt  p.s.  i'm not positive, but i'm pretty sure we're winning.
