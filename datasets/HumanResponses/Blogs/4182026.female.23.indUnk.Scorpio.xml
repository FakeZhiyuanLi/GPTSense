      Isn't that always the way?-By KES

The funniest things happen when you're trying to accomplish something.  It never fails.  Now when I say funny I don't mean funny in the "hardy har har" sense.  I mean the "you've got a run in your nylons-lost your credit card-worked a 12 hour day-found a scratch on your car-what else can happen? i'm gonna snap" funny.  When it's the last straw and you've exhausted all your resources, all you can do is laugh.

I was trying to explain this to a co-worker.  Joel was a young and eager beaver.  He was fresh out of college with a twinkle in his eye and money on the mind.  He came to the right place.  Ours is a job that encouraged over time.  Ours is a world of numbers and files.  Ours is a world of sadness.  We work all day, we burn out, we complain about our lives.  Joel was too naive yet.  Too excited with the prospect of success to realize we're all a dime a dozen.  The infamous data processor and operations analysts of the world.  All it takes is a high school diploma and a knack for computers.

Joel and I often ate lunch together.  I like him because he gave me a fresh outlook on life.  He liked me for reasons undisclosed as of yet.  Maybe it's my cynical, middle aged nature?  Maybe it's the challenge to get a laugh out of my rusty old pipes?  Anyway, we were comptable sandwich eating partners.

"It can't be that bad?  Can it?  You don't snap, do you Ann?", He asked while stuffing a steak and cheese sub down his throat.
I looked at him with envy.  I gain 20 pounds just looking at those things.  I stirred my yogurt.  "It's a tough crowd out there, Joel.  Everyone looking out for number, survival of the fittest and all that.  Keep your guard high and your instincts sharp; you'll go far."  The advice I'd given had taken 15 years to learn.  
"I don't know, Ann.  I don't think things are that bad.  I think you're just having a bad day."
With my head in my hand and my yogurt slowly rolling off the table, I snap back, "Try a bad decade."  I grab for the yogurt but stick my hand in it's creaminess spilled onto the tiled floor of the lunch room.  Joel runs to get some napkins.
Joel laughed.  "See?  You're just having a bad day."

After everything was cleaned and my face was no longer red, eating and loathing resumed.  Joel pushed too hard at times.
"You can't be this angry because of your job, Ann.  Look at you!" I did.  I had on my black skirt suit and black heels.  So what?
"So what?" I asked.
"So, you look miserable."  I realized he hadn't meant my outfit.  
"What do you mean?  Miserable.  What does that mean?" I crossed my arms and legs simultaneusly.
"You're sulking.  Right now, you are sulking."  Compared to Joel's shining blue eyes and wide grin, of course I was.  I didn't smile because I was at work.  I was in hell.  What is there to smile about?
"I'm just saying," Joel continuted, "That maybe you wouldn't hate your job so much, or your coworkers, if you smiled more.  If you made the job better, you'd feel better."
At this declaration of revolution I laughed hard.  I dabbed my eyes.  "Joel.  Joel.  I don't even know where to begin."  I caught my breath and regained composure.  "You've got to understand that I've been at this for years.  Years upon years.  You learn that there is no way to turn it around.  It's a rat race.  You break your neck all day to be overlooked, you screw up, you don't get home until God knows when and you snap.  That's all.  You just have to laugh at it.  And then you come in the next day pissed off.  It's a vicious cycle, my friend."
"Well weren't you excited at all the possibilities when you first started?"

I tried to remember.  

I went to college with ambition and drive.  I set out to study marketing at a well known university in the city.  My goal was to create my own advertising empire.  I even went back to school for my MBA.  That sucked the life out of me, but I wanted it so badly.  I made it happen.  Upon my graduation all I wanted to do was sleep.  So I did.  However, I was threatened with the reality of being homeless when my parents became fed up with this practice.  

I set out to find a job.  No advertising firm would hire me.  Interview after interview, charm after charm, I was rejected.  The old "catch 22" of having the degrees but not the experience was haunting me like a plague.  It shattered my self esteem.  My dreams of empire status dissolved a little more each time I mailed out a resume.  

And then Sarah Jones called me.  She told me she would love to meet with me.  They were impressed with my college credentials and thought I has a lot offer Financial Brothers and Trust.  I was happy.  I smiled.  I think I may have patted my own back.  Some one wanted to hire me and that felt good.  Of course there was the official interview to be conducted, but I wasn't worried.

They hired me.  They offered me benefits, vacation, personal time, a 401k.  I was an adult now!  I was in the real world now!  I was excited.  Yes, I was excited.  So I did remember.

"Yes Joel, I was." 
"Well what happend to you?"  He was truly interested.
I looked to the ceiling for answers.  "I don't know what specifically initiate the downward spirl of moral.  I guess I just became a product of my enviorment.  I formed like a mold to the base around me.  My mentors and trainers were jaded, snippy, miserab..."  I'd come full circle.  All that could be done was have a laugh.  Joel laughed, too.
"What's so funny?"  He smiled with a nod.
I put my hand to my cheek.  What a lunch break.  "I just realized I am them.  I am those miserable robots who trained me.  I am a number.  Just a number in the company.  A number that represents miserable being."  I coughed a bit.  And then I paniced.  I put my hands on Joels.  "Don't become them.  Me.  Don't do it Joel!  Try to find a way to make each work day pleasant.  Boost moral for the peers around you.  Keep being eager, hopeful, and happy.  Don't turn into me."  I pleaded with a sarcastic grin.
Joel snorted.  "Come on!  Please.  Only women fret about that stuff.  Us men can seperate work from reality."
I winced with pain.  My head killed.  I laughed.

      Tales From the Shamrock-KES*

Part 1*

The Shamrock is the local dive in a respectable suburb of Boston. The bar is green on the outside with a lone sign representing its existence. Sign or no sign-we all know it's there. Seated around the bar are the old men who live in the apartments just above the pub. In the back, by the pool table, is a younger crowd, looking to have a drink, socialize, and relax (or get bombed to escape reality, score, pick a fight. whatever). It's a tough looking crowd. Whenever a new person walks in, we all turn to stare, but give it a week and you're "in". As long as you look the other way when people shuffle into the back room and leave a tip on your two dollar beer, things are fine. But sometimes bodies are thrown out into the street. Never a dull moment. *

Last night was no exception. There was no blood or black eyes...Just a couple of usuals bickering and cracking us up.*

I walked in with my better half-it was dead. Bones and some other "permanent fixtures" were there, slumping in their chairs. We got a beer and headed to the pool table. There were some kids over playing poker and we said hello. Dougie and Milan were playing pool. Mike was trying to hustle them. Dougie and Milan were going at it like married couple and Mike was trying to capitalize on their ignorance.*

To back up a bit I need to give you the visual. Mike is a middle aged man: goatee, shaved head, tattoos covering his forearm, red polo shirt and boat shoes. He runs the Wednesday night pool tournament. He's quick to charm and quicker to take your money.*

Dougie looks about 47, but I'd guess he's really only 38-the drink'll do it to ya. About 5'6, 5'7 in height, but about 260 in the belly. He works for the town, doing what I don't know. I know the Shamrock is the last place he sees at night and the first thing he sees in the morning, so hopefully not operating heavy machinery. He's a bumbling, burly beast of a man with a thick comb-over and pudgy face. His eye is wandering and his hands are frisky. Loudly he booms in voice and step. To walk by him is to risk exploitation. Oh and he is notorious for his atomic, rancid gas. He talks with a slur-"Aahhr...a well, ok!"*

Milan is a bit shorter, and probably 30 pounds lighter than the former. He is a Phillipino, but we all thought he was Mexican. He had dark skin and black, messy hair. He wears enormous glasses and is always grinning like a goon. Picture Horatio Sans mixed with the Bumble Bee from the Simpsons. When he talks he always laughs like this "awehuh uh huh huh!" It's extremely nasal.*

Now back to the unintentional comedy. Dougie and Milan were playing pool. Both respectably good players. Factors that could go in either direction: Dougie is always drunk and Milan apparently "cheats". I do not know exactly what Milan does to cheat, but all the guys say it's so. I was told it was his "magical powers"...but that came from my boyfriend and he's a bit goofy.*

So no sooner do we sit down and light a cigarette does the comedy begin.
Dougie walked around the table and sat next to Mike. They watch Cubby, the bartender, play Milan in pool. Mike is selling pool sticks, which he bought off eBay and is selling for $50. Probably paid $20 himself. Sneaky little guy. Dougie is slumping in his seat, eyes opening and closing, opening and closing. When he speaks he yells.
"Mike! Let me buy one of those pool sticks! You know I'm good for it!"
"Noooooooooo no, Dougie. You owe me ten dollars. These pool sticks cost $50. Then you'll owe me sixty dollars." You can almost see Mike's fingers crossed behind his back.
"Arghaw, Come on! You know I'm honest! I'm an honest guy!"
(Some time passes. Milan is beating Cubby.)
"Awerghh. I'm an honest man!"
(Milan beats Cubby. He goes to say nice game but Cubby beats him to the punch, "Shut up Milan.".)
"Awerghh, I'm just trying to show you I'm honest! I'm an honest man!"
Milan waddles over. "Aw, eruh huh huh...Dougie. Let's go, big man, you turn. Awehuh uh huh."
Dougie booms, "Quiet little man! I don't talk to little boys, little man!"
Milan, grinning as fiercely as ever, "I no little. Big as you! Let's go. I win. Awehuh uh huh."
Mike smells fresh meat. "Milan! That five dollars you owe me...double or nothing you lose to Dougie."
Milan pushes up his glases. "You want to bet?" He turns to me. "He want to bet me! Awehuh uh huh huh!" I keep my mouth shut.
"Ok Mike. I bet you." Milan turns to Cubby. "We bet."
"Shut up Milan."*

Part 2*

So the competition gets going. Milan breaks and sinks a high ball and a low ball. Dougie notes.
"One high, one low Milan!" He looks like he's talking to the wall.
Milan ignores this. He knows. He shoots and misses on a high ball. Dougie steps up.
"Watch how it's done little boy! Watch...watch how...watch." He misses by a mile. "That's ok!"
"That's ok!" He says again, talking to the cue. He sits down and Milan waddles up to take his next shot. He makes it, sinking the eight ball to win.
"Awegh uh huh huh. I win Dougie. Awegh uh huh huh. I win. Mike owe me five dollar."
Dougie grabs his heart. "Oh! Arggh, should I have a heart attack now?! Or later?!".
Mike comes up and pays Milan.
Dougie sips his beer and puts up more quarters, signifying his next turn. "Should I have a heart attack now?! Or later?!"
Mike circles the table. He looks like a metro cowboy with his Nextel on his hip and his eyes on his prey. Dougie.
"Doug! Hey Doug. Double or nothing everything you own me on this game. Double or nothing."
Dougie's eyes flitter and he looks over Mike's head. He puts his hand on the pool table. "Double or nothing?!"
Mike get's into his act. "Ya, double or nothing that 60 dollars." (He did sell Dougie that pool cue.)
Dougie think about it, or is still concentrating on standing. "Seventy dollars?!"
We, the audience, laugh. My boyfriend tears.
"No, Dougie," Mike works it. "The ten dollars, plus the fifty for the cue. Double that. Sixty. Double or nothing."
Dougie rubs his belly. "A hundred and seventy?!"
Mike squats down to insert the quarters. "No, man. Dougie. You better not. Don't take that bet Dougie." Reverse psychology.
Dougie bumbles to set up to break. Mike continues. "Dougie, no. Don't take that bet." He racks the balls.
Dougie assembles his new cue. Milan sits at the tables behind him. "Awegh uh huh huh Dougie you big man. You don't take bet."
Dougie calls out over his shoulder, "Quiet little man! I don't talk to little boys! I don't talk to little boys, little man!" He points to me. "I'll talk to her. Cause she's cute. I respect the lady. I'm an honest man." He points to my boyfriend, "I'm not trying to be rude! I just respect her. Cause she's cute! I always told you you're cute! I respect the lady. I'm an honest man!"
Mike finishes racking and advises Dougie, "Dont' break with that new cue. Never break with the new cue.". Perhaps it's defective?
Dougie holds the cue across his belly. "Argrgh, I, I'm not, Mike. I'm not!" He breaks with the new cue. Luckily, it didn't shatter, as Mike might have alluded to.*

Part 3*

The game proceeded without a bet. Dougie, increasingly incoherent, never accepted. Too bad. He beat Mike.*

Next up to play-me. Great. I was thrilled. Dougie sat out and let Cubby take his turn. "But I'm up in two games! Two set of quarters up before mine. I'm just being honest! Two more games. All right cutie?!"
I sigh. What else can you do?
"Ok Dougie. Got it." I give him a thumbs up, a gesture I really disslike. But I know that even if he's too messed up to hear my words he can read my sign language. You get to know these things.*

So The games begins and Cubby breaks, sinks a couple. He opts for highs and makes another. He finally misses. I weigh my options: the 6 sitting right in the threshold of the corner pocket, an easy shot, but best kept for later; a 3 ball in the middle of the table, best shot at the side pocket. As I consider the two I receive guidance from Milan. "Yes, you can do. You do it." Which shot he's refering to, I'm not sure.
Dougie gets involved. "She knows, arggh, Milan. Let her do it. She doesn't need no help."
My back is to the husky men and they continue the exchange as I size up the 3 ball.
"Aweha huh, big man, Dougie. I just helping. You quiet."
"What was that little man? What? Speak up."
"I say nothing to you. Mind you business."
I take my shot and miss. "Distracting me, guys. Cut it out." I roll my eyes and sit.
"See that, Milan? You distracted the cutie."
"No Dougie-"
"Shut up Milan." Cubby's stepped up to take another turn. He misses, too, so I'm still in the game.
I have more options and sink 3 shots. Miss the forth.
"Nice shootin, cutie." Dougie calls out, talking to the floor. He looks over at my boyfriend, "No disrespect. You know me. I just can't refuse. She's a cutie. I just can't resist."
Cubby takes a shot and misses. He runs down to the bar to take some orders. I take my shot and miss. I wait for his return.
Milan, trying to be funny, says, "Take shot. Not tell. Awe uh huh huh." He points to the table and laughs.
"Nope. Can't do it." I respond.
"Ya, she's honest. She's not a cheater, like you." Dougie speask for me.
Milan raises him arms up in dismay, "I never che-"
"Shut up Milan." Cubby's back.*

Part 4*

Cubby must have been distracted b/c I whooped his butt. I was quite excited. Apparently Dougie was, too.
"Nice job cutie. If I had money, I'd a put it on you. You know I'm being polite. I'm a good guy. I am respectful of you winning."
"Thanks Dougie." I try to escape. Milan catches me off guard.
"Awegh uh huh huh...Dougie said I little. Who bigger? I big man."
I do not want to have this coversation. I can't make eye contact. "Dougie is much bigger. Taller and all that."
Milan cradles his jolly belly. "I weigh 230. Awegh uh huh huh. I big man."
I ran to lady's room.
Upon my return I was informed it was time to leave by the boyfriend. Our time had passed and we were done playing pool. I was fine with this and agreed to leave.
Dougie saw us prepare to leave and asked, "Takin off?".
I crossed my arms to deflect his wandering eye. "Yup. See you later." I offered up my hand for a 'high five', to avoid his "grab and pull in" technique. Failed.
He hugged me close. "Take care cutie. You know I can't refuse you. I just cant resist her." He directs that final comment to my boyfriend who responds, "Ya ok, Dougie."
I say bye and we escape. In the distance I hear them still...
"Aweg uh huh huh. You fat man, Dougie. You! Aweuh huh huh!"
"What's that little boy? Oh well. I'm an honest guy. That's ok, little boy."*
 
Until next time*
