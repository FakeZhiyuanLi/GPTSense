      Well this stinks. I don't think this is very cool. I read all of my friends blogs and I was mentioned all of 0 times. I think james and alan must love each other with as often as they write about each other. I really don't care though. I have Stevi!!!!! YEA!!! I really miss her. I don't know why I decided to go on this trip without Stevi...we could have had so much fun at Disney Land. I finnaly have internet access so I can write to my blog. Oh well. I keep thinking about Stevi and about how much I love her and how much I miss her. I brought her letter that she wrote me from home and the only comfort I can get is talking to her at night and reading her letter. I am trying to write a letter to her currently, but I am having trouble coming up with words to write. I could write what I am feeling, but even that I am having trouble coming up with words. Every night when I go to bed, I keep thining about my first kiss. I keep seeing that moment over and over. I smile. I feel all weird inside. I don't know how to describe it. It feels likie I just swallowed a 9 volt battery. It isn't a bad feeling, but more a feeling of satisfaction. I hope that is the only first kiss that I ever have because it was so special with the girl that means the most to me. I love Stevi so much. I don't know how to tell her. She seems like she is so easily able to express her emotions. I am not really able to communicate how I feel. I try my best and I think she gives me points for trying. I was able to really tell her how I was feeling before I left, but before that I had trouble saying things. After I would tell her things, though, it always turned out that she felt the same way. So now I am really becoming comforatable with talking to her about how I feel. I never have done that before. She is the first person that I felt comforatable telling that I liked her. Ever since I had seen her, I knew that I had to eventually tell her that I liked her. She is the first person that I had t otell that I liked her. I kept thinking that I might lose her and I didn't want her to leave without her knowing that I liked her. It turned out so much better than just a crush. I found the girl of my dreams. Well, james keeps telling me to read his blog so I am going to go...Stevi, know that I love you with all my heart.  RyAn ChIlD

      I am so scared. I wrote a letter the other day to Stevi. It was two pages long. Then she came over yesterday to go snake hunting with me. I gave her the letter after we went snake hunting. I rode down with her to Conoco to make sure she would get home ok. Then I came back and haven't heard from her yet...Did I write something wrong? Is there something yesterday I did wrong? I am so worried. I haven't heard from her about the letter. I am kind of now wishing I didn't write it. I just don't know. I love her soooooooooo much and am going to miss her soooooooooo much in California. Well gots to go. Ryan

      Well yesterday I got the rare oppertunity to go to the movies with Stevi. We went and saw Shrek 2. It was a very funny movie. Some parts of it were disturbing...Very disturbing. Anyways, I had a great time. I tried to invite Alan to go along, but he couldn't go. Instead I had t invite Q. He was strange as always and tried to be the center of attention. I ended that by telling him if he didn't shut up, he would have a place to put a third hearing aid. During the movie, I got a bit distracted >cough cough -Ryan-

      Why does this always seem to happen? Whenever I seem happy I get reminded of what my life really is. I was all excited that I got to kiss Stevi. I was like wow! You just had a very important part in your relationship. Then I was thinking...how many other guys has she shared that with? How many times has she looked into another man's eyes and said, "I love you"? Why am I the only one that bad things happen? It is like God is after me. I don't understand why all this pain has to be mine. There is noone to share this burden with. No one understands what I am going through. I just want to be free. Go to sleep for a while. Have time to actually sit down and think. I don't know how to do anything right anymore. Well got to go. _Ryan_

      Well today I have to clean my room. It isn't that bad except in my closet. If ever I was to make a movie that was scary, I would film it in there. It is a mess. It has stuff from every member of my family in it. Anyways, besides that I am making chilli. This stuff should blow fuses on people. I put a lot of peppers in. I am not allowed to do anything untill my room is clean though. So currently I am taking a break. I can't wait to get off and talk to people. I hope to get to talk to Stevi today. Thinking about her a lot lately. COuldn't get to sleep last night till well after midnight. All the time though I was thinking about Stevi. I miss her a lot. I best get back to cleaning my room. -Ryan Child-

            Well yesterday I went to Dana Vigil's after school party. It took me a while to convince my parents to let me go there. I had to get a ride from Stevi. It turns out she dyed her hair when when got out of school. So I got in the car, greeted everyone, and then took a seat. Soon after interesting comments started flying. They started calling Stevi Carrot Top. I was like, "Ouch! How mean!!" So we get to Dana's house and I am like ok cool. The first words out of  her mouth are you need to get swin trunks for the pool. I was like but I don't want to! Some time passes upstairs playing video games and BOOM! It happens. I was like I want to kiss her. I was waiting for a good oppertunity. It came and passed and nothing. Then another oppertunity...it passes too. Suddenly, it happens. I look at her and gradually just kiss. I t was so cool. I was happy.  So I get into the swim trunks and go out there. Disturbing things happened. I was just sitting there and Dana was like kiss her. I was like I will in my own time. So I was sitting there and Stevi and I kissed eveyonce in a while. And then we started making out when people left. It was nice. I was happy. So we come inside eventually and I get dressed. We sit down and watch a movie. So she lays down and I sit down next to her. Then I lay down next to her and we kiss and made out. I was happy. I had the girl of my dreams next to me. Best of all she likes me for some odd reason. So we are sitting there kissing and Dana comes over and bugs us. I was like leave us alone!!! So her and Jordan go off and do stuff that I didn't want to know about. So we were in there watching the movie and got back to kissing. Dana comes in again and bugs us. I got really mad. Oh well. I still got to see the girl of my dreams. I had to leave soon. I really would have liked to spend more time with Stevi, but just seeing her made me happy. Well that is all for now.  -Ryan Child

       Well today I had the time of my life. I went to the movies with Stevi, Nichole, and James. I had such a good time. We hung out for a bit before  we went to the movie.  Well after going to every place in the mall, we finally went to the movie. We went and saw I, robot. It was pretty good, though I would have a slanted view because I got to see Stevi. During the movie I think  I made quite a bit of ground . While we were watching the movie, I heard the sweetest thing I had ever heard. Stevi looked at me and said, "I am going to love you for three years, marry you, and then love you for the rest of my life." So we kept looking at each other and kissing. Finally we started to make out. That was fun. So we keep making out throughout the movie. One time, though, we made out for like ten minutes. It was the happiest I have been in a while. Just seeing her made me so happy. Afterwards, we walked around the mall some. Then I had to go home. That was so sad. I wish I could have stayed there forever with her. Now I can't stop thinking about her. Well gotta go! Bye all!  Ryan

            Well it has been quite a while since I have updated my blog. Since then lots of bad things have happened. I waited patiently for Stevi to come home from camp. While I was waiting, I felt sick and somehow I knew why. I knew that she had been flirting with other guys. When she got back, I asked her over and over if she had. Her friends eventually spilled that she had done all sorts of stuff with this kid named Aaron. She had slow danced with him, flirted with him, and given him a hug goodbye. I was really mad for quite some time about this. I am finally over it, and can't wait to see Stevi. There is only one problem. She is in trouble now and won't be off till next week. I am seeing if she can go to the park today, though. Oh, and towards the end of our fight, I asked Stevi to marry me. She said yes. So now I am a married man I guess. Not surprising. I have been wanting to ask her that since the beggining of summer. I was afraid she would have said no. Well my mom is being pissy and wants me to go do chores. Well should be going. If that Aaron kid ever reads this, don't you dare ever flirt with my wife again! (always wanted to say that =) Stevi, when you read this, I just want you to know that I love you!!! I can't wait till I turn eighteen and can actually get married to you. Oh well. At least we're engaged.   To all  my fans and other people that may be out there, bye! Ryan

      Well Stevi left for camp on the Fourth of July. I have been waiting patiently for her to get back for a long time. I must have waited at least 5 days already...but when I look at my watch, it says she has been gone two. Time is passing so slowly. I haven't heard from her since she left. I wish I had. Anyways, I have been trying to write letters to her faithfully, but the last three that I wrote didn't turn out. I wrote one last night in it is the first one that has turned out in a month. Man I miss Stevi...I wish I could go up there and see her. I would fend all the other boys away from her that have been flirting with her. I don't think fend is the right word...more like put them six feet under. Hmmm...I like this song. It is called "What it is to Burn". Anyways, I miss her so much. She left right after I got back. We didn't get a chance to see each other that much since I was back. Then when she gets back, I will be leaving for Mount Rushmore. That's exciting huh? I get to go see statues of dead people. What is so exciting about that? I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT TO GO! I want to stay here. I want to stay here for the rest of the summer. NOw my dad is talking about going up to Montana this summer as well. There is nothing in Montana. I don't want to go. I just want to stay here. Better yet, go back to school so I am here everyday and I see Stevi 5 times a week. Though I am not to fond of the homework. It is a small price to pay to see her everyday. The only bad thing about school is I can't kiss her there. Maybe if I promise Mr. Bennet that James will make out with him we can get away with it. I am slowly going insane. The only thing that is keeping me sane is killing loads of German soldiers everyday. Each day I kill more. Oh yeah! I challenged Mark to a two player fight in Medal of Honor. I kicked his butt!!! The last two shots I made were great. I used a pole to ubstruct his vision. I could still see his body, so I shot him once in the chest. He walked around a bit and still couldn't find me. The second shot I think went through the groin. That was the final kill of the game. I stayed ahead by six for most of the game and I was using my weak silenced pistol and he was using a machine gun. Oh well, I miss Stevi. When she comes back, I'll have to show her up in Medal of Honor. (since she utterly destroyed me in Halo it is only fair) That's all for now.  Ryan

      Well, I finally bought a new cd. I got Postal Service. It is a great cd. It is a bit depressing. One of the songs is really sad. Though there are some funny parts in some of the songs. In one song it says, "Last week i had the strangest dream that everything was exactly how it seemed where there was never any mystery of who shot John F. Kennedy. It was just some man with something to prove, slightly bored and severly confused. He steadied his rifle with his target in the center and became famous on that day in November." There are a lot of songs on here about girls. It makes me wonder why they made the cd. My favorite song though goes like this,   "Will someone please call a surgeon who can  crack my ribs and repair this broken heart that  you're deserting for better company?  I can't accept that it's over: I will block the door  like a goalie tending the net in the third quarter  of a tied-game rivalry.  So just say how to make it  right and I swear I'll do my best to comply.  Tell me am I right to think that there could be  nothing better  than making you my bride and slowly growing old together."  It goes on from there and is really actually quite a sad song. It made me hope that I never go through that sort of stuff with Stevi...(that is all but the lines that were the last part of the song that I put =) Anyways, I am trying to arrange to go see Spider-Man 2 with her and a couple of other people. (not Q...he messed things up last time)There is only one problem, noone is on aim at the moment. Well, going to go. RyAn

      Well I am back from Cali! I had an ok time. I really missed Stevi though. The day I got back I wasn't able to call her. My parents where being mean. So I called her the next day and she was happy to hear from me. I got to talk to her for a while when I got back from Cali, but not as often as I would have liked. Then yesterday I got to go to the pool with her. I got there and she wasn't there. She soon arrived and when she stepped out of the car I was like there she is!!! I was so happy to see her! I wanted to give her a big hug right when I saw her...but my mom was there and I knew I couldn't do that with her there. So then my mom left and I went off and got changed. So I came out and she was already there. So we walked over to the grassy area. I hugged her and sat down. We kissed a couple of times when we got in the pool. We got out of the pool when I started to shake un-controlably. So we started to make out and q and James started bugging us. They kept that up the whole freaking time. I wish I was there by myself. Anyways, that is all for now! Ryan

          Well, whe is finally back! I am so happy! I am hoping that I can go see a movie with her today. I am still trying to gather all my friends together. I swear it is like trying to heard sheep in places they don't want to go. We are planing on going and seeing the village, but I always wonder how much of the movie I will actually see. I am hoping that everything works out alright and that I will be able to go. It seems that everytime I try and do something with Stevi, the forces of  the universe pose themselves against me. LIke in California, the ocean tried to eat me! I mean what is up with that? I am hoping that if I take James, he won't go off and play ddr and miss the movie. Oh well, if he misses the movie it is his fault. By the way, James's mom is in the hospital. I have no idea what is wrong with her. He didn't say much. Speaking of which, I should call and see how he is... Well peace out everyone! Ryan
