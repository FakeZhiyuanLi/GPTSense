      Im making this blog because I want to make fun of my friends Jeremy and Shahrum. Isnt spite a funny thing? I think it is.  Anyway, unlike them I won't cry my heart out and pretend I actually care about my readers. You guys come to me for my story, I don't ask you to read it. Keep that in mind. If I misspell things or have bad grammer, its either because thats the way I actualy speak, or I really don't care. (and I'll give you a hint... I really dont care).  Anyway, the last few days I've been pimping out my Teal LeBaron GTC. Note: The car is TEAL and not sea green.

      hey guys. Its been a crazy week... kinda feels like a movie!&nbsp; I would say an Action/Adventure.&nbsp; Anyway to start things off I faked twisting my ankle to go to Virginia Beach.&nbsp; (I was playing basketball with some friends).&nbsp; When I get back, everyone tells me that they thought I got fired or that I quit.&nbsp; I said to them, "I called in twice the day before, and the second time I finally got to the LOD (Manager)."&nbsp; The Team Leader (Assistant Manager)&nbsp;said that it happens some times, and that was that.  The next day I was driving to target to get to work, and as I was going down Old Keene Mill Road, my brakes broke... literally. I pressed on the brakes and all I heard was air, and the pedal gave no resistance... So I swerved to avoid hitting some cars, and since I was close to Target I decided to continue driving.&nbsp; The hand brake was still working.  When I take it to the shop, they said that the line "rusted" from inside... but I think it mighta been a hit... ALEX.... *cough*  Today, my favorite Team Leader at Target got caught for embezzlement.&nbsp; Apparently she was stealing from Target... for how long I don't know.&nbsp; Makes me feel bad because she has two little kids... Pretty hilarious seeing her be taken away by the police... since she was fat they had to "improvise."

      I went to Virginia Beach this weekend... It was lots of fun. I hung out in the sun too much, and got a sunburn... I haven't had one in forever. I was supposed to work at Target that day too... but I called in saying that I had a sprained ankle. I got it while playing basketball with friends. Hopefully they wont find out :)  I don't feel any differnt with this NO2... Seems like its taking forever to have an effect... :| Oh well, We'll see what happens.

      I've just started taking Nitrous Oxide... It's kind of like a supercharger for your body. I will probably start taking Creatine with it also. I want to get built real fast. "I vil pump yoo aaahp!"  Anyway, its ridiculosly expensive... so I will probably just buy a knockoff if I think its worth it.  Target is boring and I hate my job there. The only good thing about working at Target is that I can walk around and just waste time. But I hate closeing like a mother. I get out much later than the cashiers... so maybe I will switch to that.
