      Date: Mon 20/04/04 Time: 21:47 Song: All Day and all of the night- The Stranglers (‘I'm not content to be with you in the daytime’)  ‘The fact was, however, that she was always dreaming and thinking odd things’ A Little Princess- Frances Hodgson Burnett   Hello and I would like officially welcome you to the blog of me Danielle Marie Mannion, star wars enthusiast and all round writing extraordinaire….okay so that last bit is just a weeny little exaggeration, but it works don’t you think?  Okay So I’m 14 yrs old and I come from jolly old England…you know, ‘spiffing’, and ‘By Jove’ and all that stiff upper lippy shite. Anyways I’m not, as you can probably tell, part of the social elite of Britain, therefore (sorry to all you Americans) I don’t talk like that, I don’t really talk like anyone really….I’m unique: ).   I like riding and swimming, oh and my violin,  I’m no Mozart by I can bang out a damn good version of Twinkle Twinkle or even a carol or two…should the occasion arrive of coarse. I’m not a carol singing freak or anything….really I don’t even like carols that much…I hate them…Really I do…Okay so I don’t…………..WELL YOU GET THE PICTURE!!!!!!!   Anyways okay time for my observations of wonder time, pay attention because you know this is once in a lifetime thing, I’ll probably never think this again. ‘If an Astronaut was sponsored by flake, would he/she eat one in space (like in the ad), because you know I was thinking about how messy they are to eat, and then I thought imagine eating it with no gravity, flake everywhere! In your hair, on your space jumper, down your space pants, up your space nostrils, okay your nostrils are you own, but you get the picture anyway’ Okay that is the end of my observation, and I shall leave it for you to ponder as Dani’s thought of the day.  Toodles (my god I haven’t said that in ages) Dani

      Time:22:02 ( I'm watching big brother across the landing....How sad am I???) Date: I think it is Wednesday.....It's June 04, get back to you with the rest of it. Song: Local God- Everclear ( kay, the whole song is going in today, coz it's all brilliant) ('You do that Romeo, Be what you wanna be, Look like you&#146;re runnin&#146; in place, Do that stupid dance for me, Do that Romeo, That go-go Romeo, I see you twist and turn, you look so stupid, happy and numb. Be my Romeo, Please be my voice in this world. I can't sing the songs that you sing, I can't find the gorgeous words. Will you be my Romeo, My go-go Romeo? I see you twist and turn, you look so stupid.  I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys. We do what we want, yes we do what we want. I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys. We do what we want, yes, we do what we want. We do what we want. Yeah, we do what we want.  Be my Romeo, Tell me all about your love, Tell me all about your pain, Baited breath and rubber gloves. Be my Romeo, My go-go Romeo, I see you twist and turn, You look so fuckin&#146; stupid.  Mmmm, Mmmm, I, I, I, I, I, I,  I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys. We do what we want, yes we do what we want. Those summer days can lead to the bad times, The world gets larger every day, Yeah, yeah, those summer days can lead to the bad blood times, They left me feelin&#146; stupid, happy, and numb, numb, Stupid, happy, and numb. I feel so stupid, happy, and numb, Mmmm, Stupid, happy, and numb,  I feel so stupid, I feel so stupid. I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys. We do what we want, we do what we want I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys. We do what we want. We do what we want, We do what we want. We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, We do what we want, Yeah, we do what we want. Oh, Yes, we do what we want. Oh, Yeah, we do what we want. Oh,  Yea, We do what we want, We do what we want.')   How much does Shakespeare rock? He really does? My god if he was alive today I would soooo love that man, only if he looked like Joseph Fiennes though ( who is possibly the only man with good facial hair). Anyway back to the bard, I've just realized how absolutely super duper great he is. I mean he did write Romeo and Juliet and Midsummer Night's dream, which are respectively my favourite film, and play. Also his film has a great soundtrack. Which leads me on the to the unappreciated genius of Baz Luhrman, he is twice the director Spielberg will ever be. Sorry it just has to be said! He is great!  Anyway I'm done with my random praising now. Feeling quite fulfilled at the moment, I've done more on my at...A page devoted to Romeo and Juliet as I was watching it at the same time, and I had started subconsciously writing the thing out in my book, good job it was in pencil. Anyway said I'd stop talking about that now, coz I’m really getting obsessed...damned soundtrack it's all that's fault!!!!!  Anyway I shall now advertise something very dear to my heart. Those who know me will have no doubt heard of my incurable addiction to Nesquik Cereal. This is, in my opinion, a marvel of what modern knowledge and technology. Knowing this, it is perhaps nobody’s surprise that I was elated to discover that my favourite cereal has now been turned into a cereal bar. I can know have nesquik cereal wherever I am, and they are very useful just before you go out the house if you don't have time to eat, as they contain 1/4 (or whatever) of your daily calcium requirements.  In conclusion my praising things blog shall end with the undeniable fact that... Will Shakespeare (here he is eating a quill)    Baz Luhrman   and Nesquick Cereal bars   Are all totally some of the best things since sliced bread, which is also very good.  All for now Dani

      Time:19:35 Date: 7/06/04 Mon Song:Lovefool- The Cardigans  ('Reason will not reach a solution  I will end up lost in confusion  I don't care if you really care  As long as you don't go')  "To write a diary every day is like returning to one's own vomit." Enoch Powell.   Are you happy now Jess, see what you're making me do, what enoch says. I know that you are a big pile of phelgmmy grossness with sam, a dfigested dung beetle stuck in you, but there is no reason to drag me into your sick little games as well you evil little fiend of hell!!!!! Ahem, and now boys and girls the nasty lady wil stop saying disgusting things to her friends and get on with her blog. My mum is out so I have the entire house to myself, a fact that i am very proud about as this alows me the freedom of running around my house like a mad man singing into hairbrushes without the constant punctuation of the phrase, 'STOP IT YOU MAD BUGGER YOU'LL COME THROUGH THE ROOF!'. Not that i can actually run more hop! I think that I must be one of those artist people who is never really appreciated until they're gone, and then everyone decides that even if they were carzy, they were pretty cool, and they should of had the chance to be even more crazy. I love the romeo and juliet soundtrack, espeically track 7, which is my song of the day, and probably will be for a while. I think it may be my fav song again, since i've just spent the last hour with it on repeat.  Oh update on my poorly toe, that i fell down the stairs and hit by the way.  It is now roughly the size of a wotsit, and is turning a wierd shade of grey/purple, in a little ring all around it. Nothing special, i think i've broken it before anyway. Now that should be enough to satisfy, the evil slave drivng Jess Wylde who does not know the difference between A design brief and a problem, and won't tell me!!!! By the way if you do know please tell me.

      Time:22:29 Song:Bohemian like you- Dandy Warhols ('you got a great car, yeah what's wrong with it today')  Firstly, I would like to express my view that, Melua doesn't wear shoes, she is a big shoeless freak!!! Thankyou Second, OMG they have changed the format of my blogging write page thing. It's cool!!!!! Third, Kirsty, outstanding choice for entry song of the day! Right that's about it now for the real bloggy bit. Though of the day 'I have a minor obsession with stars'). Seriously! Think about it, look at this list of some of my fav songs. hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me -U2 (you're a star') Electrolite- Rem ('You are a star tonight') Yellow- Coldplay ('look at the stars, look how they shine for you') that one that goes she's a star Golden years and Smooth though technically not about stars do refer to bright shiny things! Like gold and the moon! oh and diamonds are a girls best friend...sparkly much? and though not my one of my fav songs I really like the bit in all STAR, when they go  'And all that glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mould' It's worrying really! I feel like smudge, who is a magpie masquerading as a feline, in order to steal all my shiny things (e.g. jewelry), I caught her trying to eat my snake ring yesterday. Then again she does also eat paint, and paper, and orangeskins, well anything that will stay still long enough really, this includes your feet in the middle of the night too. Why on earth did I get rescue cats, why????? They're insane, I mean shadow is staring at the bloody flashy thing on the typy box now. what was I talking about????? Oh right yeah , oh here we are, an ode to my insanity and obsession with stars. My very own little star.....fish. Maybe I could name one, a star not the fishy one, I'd like that...hmmmmm     oh and before I forget DANI IS GETTING ME THE SHAMPOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BUY IT NOT!!!!!!!!!!!! Though I have been telling ppl all week so you better have got the pic by now. Anyways I'm bored now byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!

      Time:22:09 Song:Lust for life- Iggy Pop  Quote:   'Happiness is no laughing matter'    Hello followers of my humble yet cool picture infested blog! how are you this fine day? Today I have had my hair cut, it's just on my shoulders and it is layered, and looks like i have copper highlights in Kirsty's living room, but not my bathroom at home which is odd. I also went horseriding which was as always v. fun! I had to ride without stirrups again today, and now my calves hurt very much from keeping my heels down and my toes up without the help of stirrups, also my stirrups were way to long, coz the person who rides before me changed them to 11 and not 9 holes down. Silly woo woo!!! I'm now at kirsty's, we managed to blow up a bag of rice in the microwave, coz i thought kirsty had put holes in it, and she thought that I had put holes in it, so it blew up and we had to pick all the rice of the microwaves door, it was v.funny, coz her parents walked in just as we started cleaning it up. WE Bad? well i can't say my bad can I? We have actually revised, which is good, History-Public health, and Physics forces and motion. She introduced to the programme Charmed, and it is very very good, kinda like Buffy, maybe that's why I like it! Coz I love Buffy!!! They also play corrs alot in that programme, which i like a lot. Twice in one programme, I mean wow!!!!  I also showed kirsty my new fav song , which is add it to your playlists.   Even Better Than The Real Thing-U2.   All for now Dani

      Date:  Sun 25/04/04  Time:  22:12  Song:  Even Better Than the Real Thing-U2 ('Slide from the surface of things')     'Slide'    Power Animal- Fight Club.      Hello once again readers of my blog, today's blog is dedicated to SUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Despite the Penguin above. Summer is here, well at least for this weekend it has been! Which of coarse means that I will (finally) be able to wear my summer clothes!!!!!!! Which I have way more of, though I'm still going shopping for more once I get some cash!  Anyways hmm time for my mindless babble section, today's topic is related to the overall one, Wasps. Arrg, who created these winged monsters, whose only aim is to interrupt my sunbathing by slowly alking across my belly like some kind of weird belly walking over thing. They are feinds sent by the devil himself, they're evil, I tell you, Evil!!!!!!!! Anyways that's quite enough of that for now, pasrtly because I have no idea what I am typing because I'm v.tired and have switched to automatic pilot mode where I babble e.t.c Which I'm proably doing now due to the distinct lack of punctuation, well there was a comma at least. Okay I'm gonna go to bed now, but not before I introduce my Guestbook, because nobody can leave messages here otherwise. oKay It's not working never mind. Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Dani

I have erased this line.'   Oscar Levant (1906 - 1972)   Startling realisation of the day, I am nothing like my mother!   As you probably already know, well if you have the brains you were born with that is, I am somewhat of well I could say geek....lets stick with geek, they're nice people. Now you would think that a gene like that would run in the family, you know, uncontrollable clumsiness, tendency to babble, and general lack of 'cool' or you know 'normal' qualities, but apparently not, seen as I have recently found that that not only was my mother a netballer and a popular one, but my father was...well one of those really loud sporty people. I am a genetic freak; I am seriously beginning to wonder if I was adopted, if it wasn't for the rough resemblance of my mum, I would be sure of it! Well, I'm the best one anyways, because I have something neither of them (well ‘cept my mum) had.....BRAINS!!!  Omg! Okay beware my fashion mad inner self is about to emerge! I told off a townie....and it felt so cool....hang on I'll insert the convo and my comment here...I'm so proud of it!!!! I LOVE h2g2!!!!  This is what the townie said (they were dissing moshers, not that I like them either)  im a townie and we are wot we are an the only reson u lot r the way u are wiv us is cos ur all jelous cos were the ones walkin round wiv nice clean desighner fashion clothes on ! and u know that is the truth! jus cos we got respect 4 each other an we dont giv a f** about u lot cos u all wear mingin clothes that are all riped and u dnt change thm 4 days wot u gonna do wen u get older walk round in riped clothes go 2 the club in ripped clothes? and ur gothic boys wear make up ffs wots goin on??  And here is what I said  Okay there are a few opinions that I wish to express in relation to your post. First of all, 'townie' clothes are not fashionable, hence why they do not appear at the London Fashion Week. I have never once seen a model parade down the catwalk with tracksuit bottoms tucked into her socks. I would also like to challenge you to try and get into a club with your 'oh so chic' clothes on. Get a life! You'll regret this when you're older!  Anyway no one has replied...yet, I hope they do I want to annoy them more, i mean Imagine, they actually truly believe that what they wear is 'fashionable' I mean what are they on......wait a minute don't answer that one, I don't want to know.  Ooo another thing, Brand new guy on my fit list! *Fanfare* The incredibly talented and adorably geeky (well in the O.C anyway)......Adam Brody aka Seth Cohen from the O.C   urlLink         All you have to do is click on this gorgeous pic, and you will see his website!

But in the end there will be a true romance.    urlLink   Which movie do you belong in? clh     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   Kay I'm not a pirate....I'm confused!   What Disney Character are you?   You are Belle! Intelligent and misunderstood, you often retreat into your own little world. Try finding a common ground with people before you assume that you won't be able to get along wit them.    urlLink   What Disney Character Are You?(females)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     I like Belle she's a friendly person!    You're meant for year(s) 1700-1890.      You find beauty in the frills and twists of this period, where society was based on grace and nobility.

I love life....I don't wanna die! I got the same thing for the other quiz of same name. It said I was a snob! I don't like the quizzes any more (she says doing more).  What is your Inner Tree?   OAK You are boisterous and affectionate. You are the kind of tree that takes nothing sitting down, and is always ready for an adventure. You like to see everything that goes on around you. You like the warm weather, but you flourish when the nights tend to grow slightly colder. You are someone who likes to extend your days into the night hours because you never want to leave anything unfinished. You love an audience when you do things and you like to show off sometimes, but others admire your attitude. You fear past mistakes coming back to haunt you, but try to live day by day. You admire the strength of others and try to find the same in yourself. When you leave this word, you want to make an impression so that you'll never be forgotten.    urlLink   What's Your Inner Tree?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Yes I was surprised too, but we all have an inner tree. I am an Oak Tree. If you do none of the other quizzes do this one so we can all compare.  Oooh I found one in the same bit for flowers lets do that!  What type of flower are you?  Result One  My #1 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  If You Were A Flower, What Kind Would You Be?  , is  Daisy - Joyful. You, my bonnie friend, would be a daisy. Daisies are the symbol of happiness. You must be wonderful to hang out with, always so happy and cheerful. ^-^ I am so happy that you are so happy. ^-^ ^-^    Result Two  My #2 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  If You Were A Flower, What Kind Would You Be?  , is  Stargazer Lily - A dreamer. "And oh what dreams may come..." You are quite the dreamer, a romanticist. *-* You probably daydream frequently and have a very creative imagination. *-* The stargazer lily opens only at night, so it appears as if it's gazing at the stars. Perhaps you would also like stargazing.    Result three  My #3 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  If You Were A Flower, What Kind Would You Be?  , is  Baby's Breath - Innocent. Awwwww. ^-^ Kawai! ^-^ ^-^ You are Baby's Breath. Quite an innocent, huh? That's good. Baby's breath are often included in bouquets and wreaths, so don't feel unwanted just because you got a small flower! ...Oh...Oops... Stay away from cats, okay? They eat baby's breath sometimes. X_X    Result four  My #4 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  If You Were A Flower, What Kind Would You Be?  , is  Tiger Lily - Wild, crazy. Waaaaaaaaaahhh! @_@ @_@ Loca! Crazy! You are a unique and unusual specimin! Truly a tiger lily. Do you dress uniquely? Are you creative? If you said 'yes', I am not surprised! Don't let others put you down either!

      Time:21:41 Date: How the hell am I meant to know! It's Tuesday.....? Song:Placebo- Every You, Every Me (plac-ebo, not placebo, it's an entirely different band) ('Carve your name into my arm. Instead of stressed, I lie here charmed. Cuz there's nothing else to do, Every me and every you.  Sucker love, a box I choose. No other box I choose to use. Another love I would abuse, No circumstances could excuse.')  I love this song! Mainly coz it reminds me of Ryan Philippe, undoubted god of us all!  'Me- Jessica...Jessica....I'm the voice inside your head Jessica. Jess-What do you want? Me-....I don't know.' Ah don't me and Jess sound like we concentrate in history.  Kay what to say. Well first of all if this doesn't make much sense that is because I am admittedly a tiny bit tipsy. I was given a breezer at my uncles and i thought 'hmmm I need to drink it quick so I can go back and do some on my maths', so i practically downed it in one....then realised that swasn't such a good idea. Oh well cn't be helped, safe to say I haven't done any, i can't even remember what I was gonna do anyway so it's no loss.  Anyways I'm bored and writing a story while my brain is warped and full of ideas...from e-numbers not drink don't worry I'm not that bad. Dani

That pizza smells so good, soz just noticed it and thought I'd say it, it's my treat for surviving)14 June Song:Alright- Supergrass ('Got some cash, bought some wheels, Took it out, 'cross the fields, Lost control, hit a wall, But we're alright,  Are we like you, I can't be sure, Of the scene, as she turns, We are strange in our worlds') For the rest of the lyrics click  urlLink here   Quote of the day: 'Diamond Dogs are poachers, and they hide behind trees Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal' David Bowie-Diamond Dogs (oh by the way, if you type these lyrics ('mannequins with kill appeal'(just this bit)) into Google, you will discover that it is not David Bowie's song that appears first...but my blog!!!!!

Kinda vain to quote myself, but it is my duty to before the evil quote monster steals it.  oOOOOh speaking of famous Guess what? You know that piccie we thought they took during the transit of Venus. They did, My fringe looks really long! But shiny, so it's all good! Here it is!   OMG that nice pizza smell has been replaced by the smell of burning, kay one min i'm seeing what is going on.............OMG!!!My mum has gone mad, I just went out into the back garden and she was stood there poking bits of flaming newspaper into the bbq, then she proclaimed 'I'm having a bonfire!!!!!!'....I ran away! We're having pizza, it's in the oven...Why in the name of all that is good and holy in this world is she roasting the Sunday times!!!!!!!!Hang on she must be roasting the Daily mail, the Sunday times is in my room, oh thank god!! Anyway what was I saying..... Oh yes Happy thought for the day: We're all still alive!!!!! eg. We are not Mannequin food. Gentle readers I am sure that we all can rejoice in this fact together, and that is the fact that I survived!!!! I'm not mannequin food!!! I feel so much better now, in the museum 'thakerly medical museum', it was horrible there were mannequins EVERYWHERE, and they were all crusty and not real, and my chest was really tight, and the whole time I was there I felt like I couldn't breathe, and I was so claustrophobic, and I just needed to get out but I couldn't!!! It was truly awful, interesting, but awful! I feel so much better now, I can breathe again, but only just, I just felt so relieved when I got home, I sat down and on the floor and nearly cried, it was where I had wanted to be all day! Safe to say, shadow gave me very weird looks!  Update on the BBC situation, mum was burning papers rather than throwing them, I told her she was contributing to global warming and our inevitable doom...She told me to shut up. Oh here is a list of the interesting things me and Jess saw on the way to Leeds: 1. Sheep 2.Cows 3. Trees 4. Farm in middle of motorway 5. Farmer from said farm getting into blue hatchback 6.

(Kirsty you may be the only one who understands this, but he said it again today to Shirin and Jess when they asked him for a quote, safe to say I burst out laughing and made the weirdos with the blond hair and too much makeup stare at me!)# Kay there are more that just need to be said.

      Time:18:59 Song: Fly me to the moon- Frank Sinatra ('Fly me to the moon Let me sing among those stars Let me see what spring is like On Jupiter and Mars')(it's been in my head ALL day!!)  Kay so Latin today was certainly...an experience, here is how it started and my quote of the day.  Mrs Greaves: The birthrate was quite low in the Roman upper classes and we must assume that they had some from of affective contraception...(Bramwell mumbles something)...as it wasn't through abstaination. You were going to say something Luke? Luke: I was going to say maybe they spent all their time at the baths instead. (We all burst out laughing) Mrs Greaves (also laughing): And what are you insinuating that they did at the baths? Luke:...healthy exercise (more laughing) you know three sided ball games. Tom: Let's not get into that. Mrs Greaves: I agree  Me, Shannon, Vicky, Elenor, Kelly and Fallows were all in fits of laughter by the end of that one...perhaps you had to be there. We then went on to talk about chinese yang symbols drawn insterad of £, and then there was a stirring rendition of 'Turning Japanese by the Vapours', just to round off an incredibly weird weird lesson. And then I went into the hall to waitfor my mum, and Mr Fitton and Mr Grey were dancing on the stage (it's really funny!), and then Mr Wyton sand mustang sally, trust him singing 'come on baby' is a rather disturbing thing to say the least!!!!  Anyway I'm home to the relative safety of My grandma's, that is if you don't count the fact that she is (quite literally) force feeding me apple pie, I'm not even hungry!!!!!!! or skinny!!!! I'm just normal sized!  Anyway I'm gonna go now Coz i'm bored  Dani

('Hey now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play  Hey now, you're a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid,  And all that glitters is gold  Only shootin stars break the mold')  That is sooo my motto, stuff the people who say it isn't true, all that glitters is gold, even that funny congealed jam at the back of my fridge!

      Time: 21:15 Song:  '   Ah today has been good...who am I kidding Today has been GREAT!!! Despite the fact i bought nothing more than pjs and bras at the Trafford centre. Sum up of a truly marvelous 24 hrs. Firstly I got good marks on both my tests yesterday so I was very pleased. I got an extension...then again as did we all, on the maths coursework, which I think we all can agree is a welcome releif to say the least. Then I stayed after school with Jess, and we rehearsed and wrote our script. It was fun!!! I am now a wierd Italian person who is the daughter of Sammy who happens to be frm norfolk! Then we went to see Shrek two, which is just good! Esp. as it was at Bury cinema, which is one of my fav places. Then we went to Sam's and 'helped' babysit. Actually we ate doughnuts and played bargin hunt the board game..which is good, despite the fact I don't really like board games that much, as I never really have anyone to play them with. Then we went home and ate then went to bed. Anyway we got up Jess went home, while I was at the Hairdressers. By the way even if I do say so myself my hair is great!!!! It's sounds really vain but it is! I haven't stopped flicking it all day. Which brings me to my next point. Me, mum, grandma and grandad went to the Trafford centre. and I got wolf whistled, now I have been before, but never when I was wearing just Jeans and a jumper, me not the blonde, because the guy winked at me when I turned around...safe to say I think I went bright red! I was with my grandad after all. Then we ate in food from the bottom orient in these new tables we found at the back of the orient upstairs that no one ever goes to, so it's really quiet..which was good coz there was no tables anywhere else. ANYWAY, then we shopped round, bought the above. I tried on this really nice skirt, but then found out I couldn't afford it (but by then nothing could get me down :)). It was really cute, denim with like a chain on it, that was like a charm bracelet with little pink beads and faires and little metal baubles with flowers on hanging of it. It was sooo nice. Anyway! This brings me to now where I have just watched Emma...again! Aww it's so cute, I cried even more at the film than I did at the book. Such wonderful actors! Then again Ewan Mcgregor is in it! I really must stop watching such soppy films, they always make me either cry or at the very least my eyes water. Oh! I love them anyway...they're just sooo good!  All for now,  from one very happy, Dani

      Time: 18:52 Song:Secret Smile by Semisonic  (When you are flying around and around the world And I’m lying alonely I know there’s something sacred and free reserved And received by me only… Nobody knows it but you’ve got a secret smile And you use it only for me)   'Que la Fuerza te acompane'- Hans Solo (in this case)  Hello good and for the most part friendly people of the world. I actually saw what looked like a very friendly man this morning, he was clutching his lunchbox and smiling on his way to work. This very friendly man must have been friendly for his was wearing a tie with little ducks on it. I smiled at him and he smiled back. What a nice man! Anyway update on the little miss born-in-a-nosepeg. She still seems to think that her swimming car and her deserve and entire lane thereselves. But me and this very very fit, and obviously in tune with me, guy our age, swam in her lane doing length after length of crawl,s o she had to move lanes or she would have been squished by two above 5ft 7 teens. Ha Ha!!! I always win!!!!!!  Anyway when Sammy finally gets her lazy little bum down there I can do that again, coz i don't know if fit crawl guy will be there again....I hope he is!  Anyway today was good. We actually did something in PE, unless you are Jess. I got strand two sorted out a bit in maths. We sang all through graphics, everything from 'if you're happy and you know it' to 'sing a happy happy happy happy happy happy song'. I got an 24/25 A* on my physics, and i finshed everything in German and gotto get ahead on my latin, which meant Luke couldn't copy of me as much.... ha ha!!! I kinda feel sorry for him though. Shannon, Luke and Elenor are getting him moved to the ther side of the classroom. Ah well! I guess I just block out his annoyingness now...It's a skill!  My mum's hair is sooooo cool! I'm getting mine done on Saturday! But Nayway her hair is sooo groovy. It's got all these bright red streaks in it again. As my grandad mannion used to say 'Linda has had her hair done Post Box red again', ahh bless him! Anyway now I am here at my gran's writing this, about to do some art and maths coursework so I have to go now, bye!!!!!! Dani

I love the Corrs!!!!  'I've been called many things in my life, but never a vicious, cold-blooded piece of toast.' From the ever wonderful Cassandra Claire, may she find happiness, riches and the solitude of a hut where she will be chained to a computer table and forced to write forever more!!!  Anyway....Yay! Dani is happy, everyone is friends *does the friendly dance*. Oh We're like sesame street, they're all friends too! Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wanna live on sesame street, I 'd be soo good, coz I can count and I know the alphabet so nothing would be confusing at all. Just very Jolly and understandable.  The cookie monster!!!

Lovely man, French Canadian, a friend of the family. Tries to teach me Morse every time I see him. Very shy, kinda like my grandad but about 10 years younger. Can speak like a billion different languages. Lives in Coventry. And we've just heard that he's got mugged on the way back from asda, for like his wallet, which had about £20. They put him in hospital for like a month! A month! and he still needs checkups, coz he can't walk right. They damn nearly killed him for £20!!!!!!!!! And he's such a nice man!!!! They've found them and are charging them for attempted murder, that's how much they beat him up! Some people just make me sick! Bloody communists!!!   All for now, coz I'm too mad! Dani

      Time: 18:53 (I really should be doing maths) Songs: Down with love- Michael Buble and Holly Palmer (Yay! Down with love! I watched this again at the weekend. They don't make films like that anymore...it's very uplifting..)  ('Down with love let's liquidate all its friends  Moon and June and roses and rainbow's ends  Down with songs that moan about night and day  Down with love yes take it away, away') Full lyrics ------->  urlLink Here   and now to my piece of literary wonder....*fanfare proceeded by shriek of 'get on with it'.  Five places to visit before you either die or get into a 'I wanna die mood', and are thus unable to visit the places on the list due to your inability  to order tickets as you are seemingly incapable of uttering any word but 'meh' (P.s. Get a life)  The following is a list of places that I have been that I deem good enough to merit a trip for everyone at least once.  5.In fifth place we have...Dunham Massey. This is a national trust property in the Manchester countryside. It's so groovy. It has a deer park that you can visit, and see all the purdy deer. It's a historic building obviously, and is therefore packed full of history, just ask the staff if you want to know some really interesting old stories about the house, as most of them are like experts. It has pretty gardens with bits that seem to attract butterflies and bees, plus it's really colourful and purdy too. There is an ice cream stand that serves delicious national trust ice cream...try it it is gorg! There is also this grass thing (like in Stratford) where people just sit to read and have picnics and stuff. All in all, a really great place. 4. In fourth place we have... Lindisfarn (sp?) or The Holy Island, The north somewhere, England. This was possibly the best trip I have been on in my entire life so far, but this is also due to the people who went with me. I went on a pilgrimage here with my church about 4 or 5 years ago. We all waded barefoot across the sea bed to reach the island (it was low tide). Me and my mum walked with the vicar (the most friendly man I have ever met), and he helped me when I accidentally stepped in quick sand. We then went to communion in the ruins of one of the old monasteries (my third ever communion). Then we all just looked round the shops. There are no new buildings and all the shops are all old and stuff, I may go and live here when I'm all old and wrinkly, as it is the most friendly and peaceful place I have ever visited and I hope it stays that way.  3.In third place we have...Skiathos town, Skiathos, Greece. This is such a busy little place. Everywhere you look something is going on. It's pretty boring during the day but when night falls (at around 7-8pm) The town comes alive. There are shops everywhere. The buildings are all very traditional and the streets are all narrow, even the main one. There is one road around the town and you just have to walk all the way through it. It completely rocks! It's like a little maze and very now and again you find a little courtyard with a garden restaurant or a open air shop in it. There is also a roofless cinema, that is projectile onto a wall, and the roof looks like it just fell off rather than being built that way.  2. In second place we have...Statford upon avon. This just soo cute all the houses are all tudor and stuff...and the shops. Shakespeare was born here. And there is like a theatre. Fit guys from all the Uni's (inc. Oxford) just wander round willy-nilly for no apparent reason. There is a little river with willows by the side of it(which has members of the fit Oxford rowing team in it from time to time practicing). People just sit in the park and read, so when I'm waiting for everyone to finish up in marks and sparks, I don't look weird sat on the grass on my own reading a book, someone once even struck up a conversation about the book I was reading with me once (when I first got into Austen). It's just generally a great place, with really cool people, and nice people our age, who always have the really good idea of going to pizza hut and clubbing together to buy stuff. Another thing, there very few/no townies, It's like a freak of nature town. Barely any moshers either...hundreds of skaters though ;)  1. The number one place in the whole of England to visit is........... where else? International Departures lounge Terminal One Manchester airport. I love this place, all the facilities are within a few feat of each other. I have lots of money when I go so I can have a shopping spree in whsmiths for last minute holiday reading. You can watch all the planes taking off e.t.c. You can sit for hours and hours (like when I get delayed which is often) and just watch everyone. It doesn't matter what you look like at all coz no one cares as most everyone has been stuck there for hours too. You just start talking to everyone and anyone, as there's so many people in like a mini world that by the end of a four hour delay you feel like you know everybody you're about to get on the plane with, as sometimes you can just go and stake out the gate until it finally opens. Overall it is just the best place on the face of this earth that I know of.  I'm on my grandad's computer now, stupid computer. It lost all the tech work nearly, coz that's what I was working on when it all went kablooey. I hate my computer....grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, bad men with virus (in classic Narri style) I damn thee thrice to hell!!!!!!!  Yours for now, Dani

      Why we should not bitch in our blogs  by Danielle Marie Mannion   Blogs are something that records things that you want to tell people about when you are not there at the time in order to tell them. Blogs are not places where we talk about people because we are too afraid to tell them things to their face because we do not have the bottle. Some people need to sort themselves out before they start having a go at me. I cannot say this to said persons face as I am not in Lancashire, but if I was I would. I at least say the things that go into my diary to people's faces as well. I hope from this you will learn what it feels like. I will not be in school on Monday. Sort yourself out in time for Tuesday. That's all I have to say about that.I too like Sammy care. See you all on Tuesday, you too Jess. Dani  ps. A memo for future reference... NEVER annoy me when I am already mildly irritated. The results are as you can see...Unpleasant.  pps. If you didn't want to fall out with people over this. You should have told us BEFORE you blasted it all over your blog.

      Time: 20:30 Song: The Strokes (my new wonder band)- Reptilia ('He seemed impressed by the way you came in. "Tell us a story I know you're not boring"  I was afraid that you would not insist. "You sound so sleepy just take this, now leave me"  I said please don't slow me down If I'm going too fast You're in a strange part of our town...  Yeah, the night's not over You're not trying hard enough, Our lives are changing lanes You ran me off the road, The wait is over I'm now taking over, You're no longer laughing I'm not drowning fast enough.  Now every time that I look at myself "I thought I told you this world is not for you"  The room is on fire as she's fixing her hair "you sound so angry just calm down, you found me"  I said please don't slow me down If I'm going too fast You're in a strange part of our town...  Yeah, the night's not over You're not trying hard enough, Our lives are changing lanes You ran me off the road, The wait is over I'm now taking over, You're no longer laughing I'm not drowning fast enough.')  After we had bought my new coat today...which had the security tag left on so we're taking it back in the morning, we went to big W to buy a drink of ribena and some tights. While at Big W we were served by a lady called Elli, not Elly or even Ellie but Elli. Elli was new. Elli had blond hair and liked to smile. Elli was fake, from her fake smile to her silly fake hair. Elli liked to do everything the long-winded way. Elli was the reason that I was stuck at the checkout for fifteen minutes in front of Mr and Mrs we never outgrew the sixties, and behind Mr and Mrs we've tried to cover up the fact we're going gray by dying our hair a strange shade of yellow. Elli liked to make price calls...Elli needs a life. I think that Elli may have realised that I did not like her. Elli asked me if 'everthing was okay miss', I told Elli that it was and went back to glaring at her menacingly. I think Elli was freaked out....I don't like Elli. Elli then apologised for the wait. I told Elli that it was okay. I didn't say thankyou to Elli when I walked away. Elli did a price check for a lip gloss. I went home. Bored now. Dani  He he, that post was fun to write!
