       Last night there must have been a block party a few streets down. I had heard the sounds of what sounded like a garage band rehearsing. But 15 minutes later they started to play actual songs so I figured they had been warming up. The band began to play around 9:30 until midnight. I think that they were playing mostly songs that they had written. While I was in the bathroom washing my face they began to play "Born to Be Wild".    I realized that there was a good chance Logan was probably there. He was always talking about taking me to see these local bands. I wondered if he was there with his girlfriend. Dancing to the fast songs, slow dancing with her to the slow songs. I had the strongest urge to put some clothes on and walk out the door to find where they were playing. A crazy fantasy kept sneaking to the front of my mind. I would find the street and a path would clear to where Logan was. I would see him, he would see me and I would be given my second chance and everything would be in it's place, granted that is if I didn't blow it. We would dance all night long declaring our love for each other.    But then I snapped back to reality, becoming cross with myself for wishing for such an unbelievable outcome that wouldn't even be taken seriously in a 90's Meg Ryan movie, to where I was in the bathroom, standing in the shower, leaning out the window trying to hear the music better. There was no way I would have the time to pull my appearance together and get down there. I would probably walk around looking for Logan and if I did see him I would most likely turn and walk in the opposite direction.    I remember the last time I saw him. It was at Meijers. He was walking out of the store to get all of the shopping carts. I saw him and was pretty sure he saw me. But being the bitch that I am I didn't even smile at him but focused on unloading the cans. Throughout the entire time in the store I was extremely intense and apparently it was very obvious according to my mom. When we got to the fruit section, which is right by the doors, he walked in from pushing carts. He was with his friend and he was looking at me while talking to him. I'm sure he was telling him how immature and rude he thought I was, that or wondering why I wouldn't even acknowledge him. Either he would catch me looking at him or I would catch him looking at me. When I saw him my heart sped up, I got all shakey and my legs felt weird. Needless to say, I made a complete ass out of my self. Everytime I'm around him I can't find the right things to say, or anything to say for that matter. I just can't seem to get my brain to function properly. It's pretty funny when I look back on situations like this and think of how worked up I got over it.   I was supposed to go to the gym with my mom this morning but I want to stay home and workout until I've lost some of the weight I've gained over the last couple of weeks. I have this thing where I don't like anybody to see me workout and get sweaty when I'm not in the best shape I've been in. My mom tells me that's why people go to the gym, to lose weight. I know that most people working out are on focused on their bodies but I just have this terrible self-concious thing going on. I'm going to workout in about half an hour, I really need to because I have not worked out for nearly five days and just been eating like there is a buffet in front of me.   Well, this is it for now. I'm sure I'll be adding more later tonight.

        think I may actually be getting the hang of this journal thing. I already have a blog and that was easy for me to set up but I have found that the LiveJournal account is a little bit trickier to set up. I have no idea how to put pictures up and I'm not too thrilled with the layout but this is a free account so I'll deal with it. The one thing that is bothering me is that the font for my first two posts are way too large.    Crystal e-mailed me today. Apparently her mom won't be able to take her to registration because she'll be too busy with Melonie and Heather. The way her mom treats her compared to her sisters makes me glad that I'm an only child. Crystal always comes second to her sisters which is quite odd figuring she's the oldest. Anyways, my mom said Crystal can come with us which I'm slightly relieved about. For some reason I wouldn't want to go alone. I'm just nervous that my mom will see how many friends she has compared to me. I'm also worried about seeing Dustin. I wouldn't be surprised if he makes some smart ass comment on how I wrote Logan a "love letter" and he never wrote back. What a way to start a school year by confirming that the guy I love is no longer interested in me. Here I am worrying about these hypothetical situations when I'm just scared shitless about going back to school in general. Last year started off so well but just dove deeper and deeper into the deep end. Registration is just the beginning. Oh shit, what if I close my eyes when I get my picture taken? I always worry about this though it never happens.    I'm also biting my nails about homecoming. I had the most amazing time last year. I met my first boyfriend there, I loved my dress, all of my friends got on real well. I have this horrible feeling that I don't belong. I'm considering sitting this one out. It's not as though anyone will ask me. If I had not screwed things up back in January I could be talking limos and restaurants with Logan right now. But alas, things never turn out the way you think. I feel as though if I went people would look down on me. Even if I were asked to the dance by some great guy, I've put Logan on such a pedestal that no one would even come close to him. I guess I'll just have to wait until mid-October to find out.    Nothing interesting happened today. My mom wanted to go grocery shopping but I still feel like such a fat-ass after gaining ten pounds (Yeah, I know, it could be worse). We stayed in and watched a few episodes of Queer as Folk on InDemand until my dad came in from the garage and said it was his turn to watch tv. I know that a lot of straight guys are uncomfortable watching gay men kiss and all that but I get the feeling that he's slightly threatened by that show. I know it would be fair to allow him to watch except for the fact that he works midnights and sleeps during the day. it was 3 pm, he is usually sleeping. After I handed the remote over to him he just put it on the InDemand thing for a good twenty minutes before he decided on anything to watch. I'd cut him some slack if it weren't for the fact that he's a lazy slob who, when he's awake doesn't clean up after himself and doesn't even clean himself for that matter. He hasn't even finished the kitchen which he started nearly a year ago. All he has to do is put the molding up. He also needs to replace the tiling in the basement because of the flooding.   Well, I've ranted and whined enough at this moment.

       Yesterday I set up an account at LiveJournal. I don't think it's really gonna work out though. I jave no idea what the hell I'm doing. Everyone on FameTracker is talking about how LJ is more personal and a Blog is just random thoughts. I also started to set up an account at DiaryLand.com but have yet to recieve the password they were supposed to send me. i was just looking at a site called GreatestJournal.com and that seems alright. Blogger just seems so much easier right now. Apparently, you don't make friends on blogger like you do on Live Journal.

       The emails between Crystal and I are exchanged on an everyday basis (unless I am unable to respond). They have always been extremely comforting for me. On the outside Crystal is outgoing, popular and never has problems making friends. I, on the other hand seem to be the opposite. Lately, at school I think I've become portrayed as the moody, smart, artistic, quiet girl. This image wasn't really that strong until the end of the year. I have discovered that reading a book when you have free time in class sparks some unusual comments such as : "You can read a book really fast, that's lame." or "You must be really smart if you can read like that". But, we as humans judge every book by it's cover. I wouldn't consider my self really smart but I suppose by high school standards I might be considered lame. Reading has just turned out to be an ideal way to escape for me. Well, on the outside Crystal and I are quite different but on the inside I suppose you could say we are quite identical to how we view our lives.      Anyways, one of the subjects of our recent email was "What would you do if you could go back 6 months to a year in your life. If you knew then what you know now? How different would your life be?". Crystal and I both agreed that our lives would be a lot better. Immediately when I thought of this, three situations I would have dealt with differently popped into my head.     3.      Cut ties with Anne Marie-  If I had told Anne Marie to go away then there would no longer be any lesbian rumors of me floating around the school. I wouldn't have to listen to Cody talk of how he thinks she's in love with me. I wouldn't have to worry about her running to tell Cody all of my secrets. Crystal and I might not have stopped being friends for so long. Everything I told Anne Marie about Crystal when we were fighting, Crystal would find out. I cannot count the number of times I have been stabbed in the back by this bitch.           2. Told Tommy to get lost-  The first time anything really happened between me and Tommy was at Homecoming. He started talking to Me, Crystal and Anne Marie. Anne Marie asked him to dance. He said no then asked me to dance in front of her. By Monday we were dating. Tuesday we went on our first date. Wednesday I wanted to dump. Thursday he wrote me a poem. (Crystal suggested that to break up with him I write a poem). And on Friday I dumped him. What can I say, he was a senior who had failed English 9. He was almost 19 and I was a freshman who was 10 times as mature as him.           1. Logan-  The way I acted towards this man is THE GREATEST REGRET IN MY LIFE. He chased me for 3 months. I made dates and broke dates with him. He gave me rides home and we flirted through text messaging. I wasn't interested and finally broke his heart. Karma would have it that I am now head over heels in love with this guy. I have gotten through the phase where I cry every night over him. But I would still do anything to have him. I don't deserve him, understandably. I wrote him an apology letter about two months and have yet to recieve a reply from him. The funny thing is EVRYONE I knew told me to go out with him. Crystal says that if I want to get over him then we'll have to find me a new boyfriend. Easier said than done.         Now looking back on this list numbers 2 and 3 are nothing compared to the way I feel about number 1. But that's life for ya. You make mistakes and get your ass kicked, emotionally speaking, and you learn.

       Throughout this summer I have begun watching Queer as Folk. It's safe to say that this is now my favorite show. It all started because of Vh1. You know, the "I Love the 90's". It got me hooked on Hal Sparks as well as Mike Ian Black. Everytime Hal would be on I would comment on how hot I thought he was (I'm a 15 year old girl, what do you expect?). My mom would then sarcastically say "Yeah, I bet he's even hotter when you see him making out with guys on Queer as Folk". Of course in my head I'd be going  I would sure as hell like to see that.       So late one Sunday night I turned to Showtime. It was the season finale. Needless to say after that I was hooked. Luckily, we have InDemand. Unfortunately we have a big lump laying in the living room who never showers that I like to call "Dad". He works midnights so that's his excuse to soil our once clean but always expensive furniture. The entire fourth season is on InDemand so once I coaxed my dad out of the living room I sat my ass down and entered the world that belongs to the fictional characters that are Micheal, Justin, Brian, Emmet and Ted.      Two months later I have watched the entire fourth season and am now what my mom likes to call a "fag hag". I bought the first season on DVD off of ebay. It's weird to watch episodes from the 1st season then watch the 4th season. Sometimes my mom will watch it with me. But not when my dad's around. He says that it's a guy thing to not want to watch a show like that. I understand but for some reason I feel as though he may be slightly threatened by it.      This will sound crazy but I can't help but wish that I could meet someone who looks and acts like Brian Kinney. If only every high school student were as lucky as Justin and have an affair with a man like that. Well, I think I'll end this post right now. I'll probably post again later.

       Okay, the last time I posted was on another journal which, for some reason I can no longer access. Well, I recieved a packet from school today with all the forms I'll need for registration. I'm starting 10th grade on August 30th. In no way am I happy to be going back. But it's not like I had this awesome summer. I spent it inside, up in my room because my father who works midnights insists on sleeping in the living room in front of the tv. I can't really say that I was upset about having to stay in the house all summer. By the end of 9th grade I had practically been worn thin and was becoming increasingly depressed. That was quite odd figuring I had started out that school year happier than I had been in a long time. I guess that's what happens when a rumor starts going around the school that you're a lesbian, you fall in love with the one guy (Logan) who had been chasing you for 3 months only to find out he now has a girlfriend, your ex-boyfriend winds up in jail and your best friend ditches you because "she can do so much better" all in the span of about 2 months. And I am not exaggerating any of this in the slightest. So not only can I not have the guy I want but I can't really have any guy at all thanks to the rumor.I'm not saying I'm a victim here. I take the blame for the whole Logan situation. He persued me and I led him on until I announced I liked his friend, Jim. Shortly there after I fell head over heals in love with Logan which would result in me crying about three times a week over him. I have since written him an apology letter but understandably have not recieved a reply.The whole lesbian thing was out of my control. I think an ex-friend started it and now there is no way to reverse the damage. My ex-boyfriend in jail: I'm not even going to give any details because I'm so ashamed of him and the fact that I dated him.And now for the best friend problem. I'll abmit we both took equal parts in our friendship breaking and have since admitted it and have become friends again. For further reference her name is Crystal.I am so nervous about starting school. Like I had said, last year started off great but by the end of the year I practically pulled all the way into myself. I think it's safe to say I was suffering from depression. Atypical depression to be correct. I read about it online and sure enough I had all of the symptoms. Since summer started I've began to feel a little bit better emotionally. I can't say too much physically. I used to excersize everyday and eat healthy but since June I've put on 10 pounds. I know that may not sound like a lot and it's not as though I've become morbidly obseise but for a girl, that's a lot of weight. Fortunately I still fit into size 6's. I just want to start over this year and have fun. Well, I think I'll post more later.
