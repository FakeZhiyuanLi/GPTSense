      Today's exam is not bad. It's the one that I most statified with. No big unreasonable mistake at least.  Today, I read something about web mining. This is a book about how to building a web search engine. It's quite interesting, but it's hard to undersand when I go deeper into it.   At least, it gives me a general opinion on how Google is built. haha..

      It's really tired of keeping on writting for 3 hours! It's exhausting.  The even more daunting thing is that I didn't do a good job in today's exam. I don't know how to write the last big question which account for 9 marks out of total 25. I think it will be lucky to get 2 or 3 in the last big question.  Anyway, if you just want to pass the exam, you will feel much better. But if you require yourself to be excellent, that's really hard and really tired. Probably, I should adjust myself and try to be better than myself instead of others.

      today I finished my first final exam. It's not difficult, but I made a lot of stupid mistakes. I don't know what's wrong with me...  Anyway, it should not be a problem for passing. That's fine.

      I think it has no big difference with the personal website which populared a few years ago. But blog focus on the interaction between different users. And also this system provide a powerful communication system between users that the users with same hobbies, occupations and interesting can communcate with each other.  It's a wonderful thing. But can I create a blog system of my own, maybe I can use the Blog API... It would be interesting.

      Thank god! I got a not-bad-result for last semester's final exams. You can say, it's pretty good after I knowing most of others can not get that kind of mark.  I am planning to apply for a research project for next semester. You know, all postgraduate student in US would do some research in their postgraduate study. So to keep breast with the international rule, I think I should do some reseach, although the time is short.  Today, I got a mail from a supervisor that he told me there is a chance to work in National ICT Australian laboratory. I think probably I am not doing any research but working. Anyway, I'd like a try, for the big name of "National laboratory".&nbsp; I will be joining a project named "eMotion", it's not bad if I can really learn something from it.  I&nbsp;have some other choices, probably also just WORK in the university.&nbsp; So considering both of them are working, I'd rather choice a big place.   Yesterday, I talked with a bei's sister. I think her english has quite strong "Chinese" flavor although her thought is quite American.&nbsp; I don't like women to be very materialic. You know, true love is getting more and more precious in this world. I pray for my true love.

      Not bad, generally, although it's difficult.  Today I found so many more books on shelfs than usual, maybe because it's the end of the semester and people returned their books. That's great!  I heard of two books for a long time: "an introduction of general system thinking" and "psychology of programming" which are written by a very famous writter, weingberg. But unfortunately, I failed to find them although I see the index entry in the library.    By the way, I have a glimpse on the book "practical programmer", also read "How to be a excellent programmer" in Chinese translation. It's good. Not only it says something about coding(actually, I don't like the word "coding". It makes people think it's a stupid work), but also says something about how to work as a programmer. For example, it gives a story about "stone soup" and "boilded frog" to explain we should be a catasclyst of changing and should focus on big picture(keep on reviewing").   Anyway, not bad.  I love reading, but I am not patient enough to finish a "BIG" one. I'd like some fast-food articles, unfortunately, it's not that nutritious. But the problem is: I want to get the maximum in a minimum time. How could I?  Maybe I should change my reading habbit or improve my reading effeciency.
