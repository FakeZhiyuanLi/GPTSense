      I draw hearts on my sleeve and it all starts with an arm wave Its so hard to achieve but when its all done its alarming Embalming fluids on my mind, I want to preserve these thoughts The startling truth is we'll never find those words that we sought I'm not the worldly sort, this stirring plot I gave to you Could be curdling pots while they're worrying which slave to choose So praise the clues that I lost I was never a detective But the few that I saw undisputedly swore that I was defective You chose the path of least resistance with a variety of wishes I went the highway, its my way to be what society sees misfits Don't fight with me, I silently wish to be invisible now You drew lines in the dirt to draw me from the visible crowd Its inadmissible how we saw the sun and moon in two ways Whistling wow, I'm officially allowed to swoon for two days Whatever you say, please don't try to croon and send hope I'm telling now, you're the full stop after my endquote...

      I can hear the collective groan of my readers now... "Ohhhh not again... another angst filled post!".  I've received feedback telling me that I'm a negative prick and it seems that I might have upset some people.  Conversely, I have also received positive feedback.  In any case I'm going to still do my thing.  This time, however, I have something positive to say... well kinda...  I was in a particularly introspective mood today so I decided to think about my situation.  I have a credit card debt thats spiralling out of control, I owe around $16,000 to the bank from a personal loan, university exams are killing me, I have a grand total of $13.75 to my name and I need to find a job before I graduate in 3 weeks.  On top of all this, I'm also trying to quit smoking during my exam period!  Stressful?  Fucking oath!  With all this, you'd possibly think that I'd be a fucking wreck and you'd possibly be right but I don't feel it.  Yes, living on instant noodles is going to severly damage my liver.  Yes, I can't even afford petrol to go to a job interview.  Yes, I'm poorer than a one legged heroin addict in rehab.  Yes, if I don't find a good job I'll be stuck in this dead end one right now speaking to the clinically retarded.  Yes, I've found myself trying to smoke pens in class.  Yes, I have started the last five sentences with yes.  But at the end of the day its all good!  Why, you ask? The answer is simple.  I have my health (well, I can walk and sorta breathe), I have my family and I have my friends.  Sounds corny?  You can bet your sweet little Brady Bunch ass it is but its the only thing stopping me from going postal!    The biggest thing that keeps me happy though, is my love for music and art.  Music?  Art? Fuck!  Have you clicked on the wrong link?!  No, my dear jittery one, you haven't.  The reason I'm in this mood is because I fell asleep last night listening to one of my favourite albums and before I went to sleep I finished what I think is possibly my best work of art ever.  So naturally, I woke up today feeling quite content.  I don't quite know how to classify the true emotion I felt this morning so I'll just refer to it from now on as the Pig in Mud Syndrome.  To try to feel in the same mood as I felt do the following: 1) Go buy (DON'T FUCKING DOWNLOAD) Qwel - If it ain't been in a pawnshop then it can't play the blues.  2) Learn to appreciate the art of all kinds.  If all else fails, try visiting these websites (I always find inspiration there):  urlLink This site...   urlLink This site...   urlLink This site...   urlLink This site...  and last but not least  urlLink This fucking great site  :D  If all else fails, slit ur wrists and call it a day.  If anyone wishes to help me in any way or if you'd like to donate money, please email me at dawtcawm@hotmail.com :).  All donations are tax deductable.

      In every Jerry Springer episode we hear this phrase screamed by a "guest" on the show while parading up and down the stage.  Why do people feel so compelled to comment on the life of a complete stranger?  What is the attraction of giving someone advise that you would never personally use?  What is the point of bringing more complications in your life by immersing yourself in someone else's mess?  What is the point of me writing all this?  Well read on...  Actually, fuck it! If you're reading on to see whats troubling me, then you're probably one of those people... hahaha.  Lets just say you're reading on because you're bored shitless and will not give a fuck about what I'll be saying.  This way, you'll distance yourself from these pathetic humans I'll be talking about.  Today I find myself repeating that over and over again in my head like I'm some autistic kid that learnt a new word.  "Fuck you, you don't know me! Fuck you, you don't know me! Fuck you, you don't know me....".  Just because I can't be fucked talking about the weather and the fully sick club you went to on the weekend, does not mean that there is something wrong with me.  It does not mean that I am having a bad day and it does not mean that I have something against you.  All it means is that I can not be fucked listen to every excrutiating minutiae of your life.    These people, however, always seem to want to push the matter and delve into my brain to understand what is troubling me.  The fact is, I'm not troubled or phased by many things.  I am however troubled by their need to comfort me.  Am I a newborn baby? Do I need a nipple to suck on (maybe... :P)?  Do I need to be carried and wrapped in a blanket?  FUCK YOU, I don't so please do not talk to me.    So what is my solution to this?  I am going to make some t-shirts that say "I don't have a problem, I just don't want to speak to you".  I think its either that or buy myself a salt mine in northern Mongolia and spend the rest of my life there with my pet yaks, at least they can't talk.  I'm sure everyone feels this way sometimes so if you're interested in these t-shirts please email me.  You've just wasted ten minutes of your life reading this.  Couldn't you have done something a bit more productive?  Fuck you, you don't know me! :)

      Even when you win, you're still a fucking retard.  Look what we have here! It's my first post and what a fitting title.  I have no doubt that this blog will cause alot of hand wringing and nervousness from those who are strung too tightly.  Please forward all hatemail to letgodhandleit@heaven.com.  So, without any further ado, lets delve into today's little lesson kiddies.    Let me pose this question to you, whoever you are. Why the fuck do people take the Internet so seriously?  If we look at it from the most basic point of view, a random statement by a random stranger from a random location in the world should not affect the way you think.  Lets say for example that you're a incontinent, midget vietnam war veteran with one eye, half a leg and Tourette's Syndrome from Shithole, Australia.  Would you care if little Billy Bob from Anytown, USA, mentions to a friend as they walk down a dirt road to lynch someone that he hates blind little people who shit their pants and can't talk properly? If you have half a brain, you would brush it off your shoulder like a loose bit of fluff.   Having said that though, we still see people online everyday having fights with someone half a country or half a world away!  I salute these people!  They are a constant source of fun and laughter to me.  Never in my life before I started coming online have I seen a larger group of insecure people!  Freud would have a field day on these kids' minds.    So this is my first blog.  Quite a load of drivel if I do say so myself, but I you kids enjoy it.  Until next time, send me all logs of funny conversations...
