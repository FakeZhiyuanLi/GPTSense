        Once again, the absolute boredom of my daily life takes over and I am once more sitting at my computer screen, typing away to my seemingly nonexistant readers. How joyful! There's a lot of things that I wonder about. One time I was writing a letter to my friend and I just got infinity and eternity stuck in my head, so I wrote over a page about the both of them and, mind you, my handwriting is extremely small and cramped, so it would take like three pages for someone else to write what I wrote. It was so odd because I felt so stupid for not being able to fully grasp both of these concepts. Infinity is space stretching on forever and eternity is time never ceasing, right? What's so hard about that you must be wondering. But then I remembered reading Revelations from the Bible and began to wonder where eternity goes for everyone in Hell when the world ends. When the world will end, those that will be saved shall have the mark of the Lord on them and they shall be spared. But what about those on earth that are not marked? Are they sent to Hell? Does Hell ever end? If there is no more earth, then what's the point of having Hell? But then, you gotta wonder, all the ppl that have been sent to Hell after the thousands upon thousands of years on earth, if Hell was destroyed and was no more, then what about their so-called eternal souls? If Hell dies, then so must they. But they're already dead! And then infinity! If God created all that space and there's nothing out there besides us, then it's a complete and total waste of space. But how far does it go on? How do we now it exists? How do we know that there is no end? You can travel to infinity as much as you can travel to the ends of the earth, for neither exist. Maybe we just think there's no end to it when it, in fact, goes on and on in circles and we never realize the circles we make. *sigh* I feel so stupid right now. Bleh.    But now I'm gonna go.  Sleep well all and have a nice evening.  *kiss*

        Puccini is a musical genius.  Of course, I already knew that, having played O Mio Babbino Caro, but man.... La Boheme was, in a word, amazing.  The music was so gorgeous and the singing was fantastic.    The National Symphony Orchestra did a wonderful job with the music.  Plus, Italian rocks.  I wish Puccini was still alive.  I'd love to marry someone with as much passion as he had.  I love his stuff so much.  *sigh*  I wanna go see tons more operas now!  It makes me feel somewhat like a music freak, but I also know that I'm cultured.  haha...      Not much else in the world of my crazy-cookie-ness is new.  Bye bye for today.

        Well well, here I am once more, sitting at my computer screen... I was reading some LiveJournals from some of the ppl here.  It's funny.  They all hang out together nearly every day and have tons of fun and have all these inside jokes and all that good high school stuff.  And I talk to some of my NC friends almost everyday and they all talk and hang out and have fun and all that high school stuff.  Then there's me.  I get up everyday at 9-ish, work out, practice my viola, sit around and watch TV, write poems and letters, and work on my summer stuff for school.  It's nearly on the brink of hopelessly pathetic.  Sad, huh?  Moving isnt fair to anyone except the ppl that make you move, in my case, being the military.  Curses upon the military.  But lets not open up this tragic tale of loss.  My friend and I were talking yesterday about "the one."  We both said that we could hardly wait to meet him, but were also scared of the entire thing becuase, as we all know, with getting attached to someone in any way will eventually bring upon pain.  I want to know how I'm gonna meet him and where and, most importantly, when.  I hope that I havent missed him already and let my one chance at true love pass me by.  Or maybe there's more than one "the one" and we all get a few chances at love?  Maybe God grants us that mercy.  I dunno... Makes my brain hurt thinking about it.  But anyhow... my mother and sister and I are going to Wolftrap to go see La Boheme (spelling?) tonight.  For you uncultured ppl, that's an opera written by Puccini, who is, in my opinion, the most passionate composer in existence.  And I'll go now.  Adieu, my loves.

         'Ello loves!  How are you all doing on this fine day?  Actually, its not too fine of a day and it's almost over anyhow, but whatever.  My first blog.  How thrilling.  Can you hear the excitement just dripping from my voice?  Well, lemme give you all a general overview of myself.  I'm 16, I just got my license, and I'm rather crazy, if I do say so myself.  But I dont really care.  It's all good anyhow.  I live in northern VA and I just moved here almost 2 months ago from eastern NC and I miss it with every fiber of my being.  Like it really helps matters here on the homefront.  But anyhow... I love music, I play viola and have been for 7-ish years, and I love wrestling.  And God.  God is good.  I dont really have much to say or to talk about, but I shall use this as a way to get my thoughts out into the world.  I shall leave for now, but first I will give you all some song lyrics by Jimmy Eat World to start a thought.       "If I dont let myself be happy now, then when?  If not now when?"       Take control of your life.  Do what matters, dont look behind you, dont have any regrets, but also dont forget what it is that's gotten you where you are.  Love yourself, love your neighbors, keep your faith close.  Hold onto everything that matters in your life as hard and as long as you can.  Smile often.  Laugh much.  Love.  Live.  Welcome to my sporadic optimism.  Dont get used to it.  Farewell for the present.

        Sense of rage... complete outrage... Like I said yesterday, you all should check out that thing about God on that wrestling website... Ooh, atheists make me SO mad sometimes! I mean, I dont press my religion on anyone and I dont go around denouncing someone elses. But people who arent religious at all? People who havent even read the Bible trying to tell me about MY religion?? I dont think so. Ugh, makes me sick. Its like me trying to explain to someone the rules of a wrestling match if I've never seen one. I dont care if someone is an atheist or Buddhist or Muslim or Jewish or Protestant in any of its forms. That's their business, its up to them to decide what they believe in. If you ask me a question about Catholicism, I'll answer it to the best of my knowledge. But I'm not going to twist what other people say about their beliefs so that they are contorted to fit mine. Gr. Definite sense of rage right now.      On the plus side, I did ten more terms for my AP work today. I studied for the SAT as well last night and shall later today also. I feel like I'm finally getting somewhere. When I was reading Moby Dick for English, I felt like I wasnt getting anywhere and it took for-freaking-ever to get it all done.  But now I'm doing stuff thats productive adn I feel good about it.  Wait.. feeling good about working.. is that healthy?????      I love Smile Empty Soul.... "With this knife I'll cut out the part of me... The part that cares for you... With this knife I'll cut out the heart of me... The heart that cares for you..."  Great stuff.      Anyhow... Must go be productive again.  Toodles.

        Got up at 9:20 am today, worked out, then jumped on the computer and hit my AP US History terms hard.  For like 2 hours of work, I got 10 done.  Only 36 more to go.  *groan*  I'm sick of the class already and school hasnt even started.  Figured I needed a break... So let me rant here a bit.      On  urlLink www.themat.com  there's some message board things and one of them is under the "Non-Wrestling-Related Topics" and someone started this one called "God Loves You."  It's really interesting to read and I highly suggest that you all go check it out.  There's one particular guy that keeps responding to everything, saying that just about everything in the world proves that there is no God.  It's kinda disheartening to read that because I'm Catholic and my beliefs are firmly rooted in me.  It's as simple as breathing in my heart.  In my mind, it's as all religions are, completely contradictory, making little sense if you think about it too hard.  But in my heart, its truth.  And someone saying that there is no God is rather hurtful as well as vexing.  There's tons of people trying to convince this guy that there is a guy.  But then he keeps twisting all their words to make it sound like they're religious freaks with nothing better to do in their lives than pray and rely on some non-existant superior being who's only goal is to harm all of manner of living creatures.  He's saying that its people like us hardcore Catholics who make religion a scary thing.  Funny that its people like him that make us believe all the more in our religion and make us want to reach out and help the faithless.        I had a scary dream the other night.  It was about school starting a week early and I didnt have my AP US History summer assignments done and it was really freaky.  It gave me incentive to just do the stupid crap and get it out of the way, just in case school starts a week early.  I had a really creepy dream last night about this sick guy from North Carolina that I disliked wanting to get with me.  *shiver*  Dreams are weird.  And I've had dreams about him before too.  Half the time I was killing him, the other half I was kissing him.  Very odd.      I think that I'm addicted to Winterfresh.  I already know that I'm addicted to chapstick, preferably the strawberry.  But this gum thing is rather new.  I crave it at odd times in the day and have to run around in search for it because I always make sure that I have some.  It was pretty bad during baseball season this year.  I had to have it at every game or I got too bored.  I think its worse now though.  Haha.  I gotta have that and my chapstick.  Thank God for gum and chapstick!!!!!      Anyways... This is enough for now.  Goodbye all!

        I cant get over that movie!  It was so awesome.  I'm still trying to figure it out.  Well, I got it down, but everything is just playing over in my mind.        Anyhow... I finished all of my questions for my AP US History summer assignment (yay) and now I have to explain the importance of 46 people/things in 3 different ways each.  Whoop-de-freaking-do.  That's gonna be fun.  Thank God I already finished my AP English summer reading and assignment!  (Never read Moby Dick!!!!  Death to Moby Dick!)  Plus I've started studying for the SAT, so I'm set!  AND I practiced my viola today for 55 minutes straight, no breaks, no nothing.  It was great, but now I can hardly type and my fingers are once again black... Eek!  But its lovely anyways.      I MISS HAVELOCK!  AND I MISS WRESTLING SEASON!      Not much else is going on here.  Have a great night kiddies and good dreams!  *hug*

        Brad Pitt is one of the finest men alive.  He is an amazing actor and can play many different parts.  But he never ceases to be gorgeous.  In the movie Fight Club, he shows off his sexy muscles and it is great.  The main character (the not-Brad guy) is also pretty good and has a thing in the movie about "I am Jack's  " and I found it extremely entertaining.  If you get the chance to see this movie, take it.  It'll hurt your brain quite a bit, but the blood and all is fantastic.  And I dont have much more to say, so have a great evening.  Adieu.

        I can safely say that I have a redneck. No, I'm not A redneck; I HAVE a redneck. I finished practicing for today like 10 minutes ago and my neck is all red from the stupid instrument... Speaking of rednecks, I dont like them. We had a ton of them at my old school. I even went out with one of them. You know, one time we were on the phone and he put the phone down one time and the next thing I heard was this huge BANG... He got back on the phone and told me that he'd just shot a squirrel in his backyard. I almost cried. It was tragic. It was this poor little helpless little squirrel and he just up and killed the poor thing. *sigh* And another thing about rednecks that annoys me besides the hunting factor is the way they say the word "athlete." It's a two-syllable word, right? Of course I'm right. But they say it "ath-uh-lete." UGH. It bothers the heck outta me. *grumble* Dumb rednecks. No offense intended of course, but grr...      Anyhow, the concert. Complete yawn. The first piece was some overture by some guy that dragged on for likr 15-20 minutes. Then Itzhak (I finally realized I've been spelling it wrong) Perlman came out and play a (I think) 3-movement thing by some guy that was actually rather pretty, but that dragged on for like half an hour, 45 minutes-ish. Then we all proceeded to clap for a really long time. He came back out and bowed two or three times before shut up and sat down. Then there was 15-ish minute intermission and then another 45 minutes or so of some 4-movement something or other that was completely and totally boring. The only cool part of it was the cymbal crashes and how the violas harmonized with the cellos for awhile in the beginning of it while the violins had to shut up. That was lovely. (FYI, violins sound like dying cats. haha.) But I was pretty much bored the whole time and sat around and watched and heard and thought, but never really listened. How funny. I think that I figured out that for any concert or musical performance to be interesting or worth my while to go and see and listen to, I have to be emotionally attached to what is being played. Most of the concerts I've been at have been ones that I've played in, so I have to be attached somehow to those because I'm actually in them. Wow, redundant, but I'm not gonna go back. And then La Boheme that we saw awhile ago I adored and cared about because Puccini rocks my world and his music is just so incredibly passionate that I cant help but be drawn into it. But the stuff that we heard last night, I had no attachment to them whatsoever, so I was rather apathetic towards them. It was an interesting thought.      My practice today went surprisingly well. I started off with some Wolfhart, then went to those evil double stops, today in fourth position instead of third. Then onto the fourth position exercise in that one book and next I went thru all the scales I know just about, including the minor ones that I have to know for Regionals. That took awhile because I did them slow first and all single bowed, then did them again faster and bowed the way they have to be for the tryout. Next I did some Stamitz and killed it like usual, then half of the Bach Cello Prelude (I'm working on memorizing some of it), then the Bruni piece that also goes with the Regionals tryout. Then my shifting stuff (not gonna even try to explain it), O Mio Babbino Caro, a one-octave D Major scale, and I packed up. Took about 45 minutes total. Not too shabby. I didnt slack off today, so I'm proud of myself. :) Yay for me!      Sorry I've been so vague about stuff today. I cant remember what anything was called or who it was by, music wise. haha. That's the price of being book-smart. You're pretty dumb with everything else. Gonna add something else to this. Thought it was rather hilarious.         You have a mysterious kiss. Your partner never knows what you're going to come up with next; this creates great excitement and arousal never knowing what to expect. And it's sure to end in a kiss as great as your mystery.      urlLink       Isnt that funny?  Mwuahaha.... anyhow, I've blabbered on meaninglessly enough tonight, so I hope that you all have pleasant nights and lovely dreams!

        I'm decently intelligent.  Because of that, I'm going to go to college sometime in the seemingly near future.  Because of  that,  I'm going to have to take the SAT.  I signed up for it today and have just over two months in which to prepare for it.  I am going to die.  This guy I know was valedictorian at my old high school my freshman year.  He got a 1520 on the SAT after eating a Snicker's bar and a glass of orange juice for breakfast before hand.  I think I shall follow in his footsteps and have sugar only before I take it.  But that wont lessen the grip of Death on my soul.  Born intelligent, doomed to die young.  I have two months in which to live.  God help me.      Anyhow.  We're going to Wolf Trap again tonight to go see the National Symphony Orchestra perform with Itzak Perlman.  I totally forget what they're playing, but it should be good and Itzak will rock the planet without any shadow of a doubt as he always does.  I'd love to see him and Yo-yo Ma in concert together.  Or soloing together.  Or whatever you wanna call it.  Hah.  Musician here talking and I dont even know what to call it.  I crack myself to little pieces.        Hmm... what else to bore you all with... Oh, I jammed on my guitar earlier when I was crying my eyes out.  That was fun.  I love my guitar.  Then I listened to some Mindless Self-Indulgence... That rocked my socks off.  And then I practiced my viola.  That went decently well today.  Bach is still killing me (I hate the Allemande and Sarabande AND Gigue) but I'm almost done with the suite so its okay.  And I did scales for awhile too, which is always a good thing.  Double stops in third position on the G and C strings suck.  fyi.      You know, I was thinking the other day.  Most times when I was younger, moving was cool and wasnt a big deal.  But in recent years, I've hated it simply because I've had good friends that made me wanna stay behind.  So it makes me wonder.  I know that I'm gonna have to leave some time or other.  And I'm gonna lose friends in that process.  And along with having friends, you get fights and stuff and you're gonna get hurt while you're there.  But if you dont have friends, you're gonna be lonely have nothing to do except sit home and study Biology or something.  So its kinda like the whole loved and lost thing.  No one can really get both sides of it.  I'm a people person.  I accept that I gotta get hurt.  But I know someone who hasnt ever really had a good friend or best friend and has always been kinda lonely.  Both are not cool.  Which would you choose?      And now I must go, so I bid you all farewell and adieu and hope that you have a lovely evening.

        ...in the back of your head?  The one that tells you that you're not good enough, that nothing good will ever come to you, that you're not smart enought, not talented enough, not fit for the world?  That the world and fate have it in for you and that you should just give up while you can, before the world kills you?  That says true love shall never come and you shall be left alone for your whole life?  That in the end, evil conquers all?  That God doesnt care?  That He's not looking out for you?  That tomorrow will be as pointless as today?  That hope and dreams can only lead to pain and disappointment?        I am hearing the voice right now.  It's not a pretty voice.  It's evil and suavely grotesque, if that even makes any sense.  I hate that voice.  I keep telling it to shut up and leave me alone, but it never goes away.  And now I'm another conformist, another teenager yelling out for justice and to be noticed and for fame and fortune to an empty computer screen, hoping that someone will care.  We are all so stupid.  Everyone.  As I've said before, humanity is comprised of idiots, me included.      Sorry everyone, but music is kicking my butt.  I cant seem to make sense of the past seven years I've been playing viola.  I cant find the reason in it.  I cant find the joy or the passion or the love.  And I dont know why or how.  But I know it's not good.  Not at all.  Grrrr.  But God, I know, is looking out for me.  I just have to keep on a look out for where I'm supposed to go.      Good news:  tomorrow my family and I are going to go see the National Symphony Orchestra and featured soloist Itzak Perlman play at Wolf Trap.  Eh... should just make me feel worse about myself and the whole music situation.  Humanity sucks.    Anyhow... I think that I shall go now.  Have a lovely evening and have pleasant dreams.  Goodnight.

        I already knew that, but dang, today proved it all the more.  A few of my friends came and picked me up today and we went out to go see a movie.  On the way there, we were in the left lane of a 4-lane road divided by a median, right?  Right.  So right in front of us, this car brakes to avoid colliding with a huge truck coming from the right lane, going across the median to get into the right lane of the opposite traffic.  A u-turn across 2 lanes of traffic?  I dont think so!  Idiots, I swear.  No one up here can drive at all.  Grrr.  Dumb dumb dumb.  On the brighter side, the movie was rather hilarious.  Made me giggle a lot.  I thought some guy behind us was gonna have an accident cuz he was laughing so hard.  Another stupid person.  Admit it, everyone.  You're stupid idiots.  I do.  I can get over that.  Curse of being an honors student: no common sense.        But anyways.  Not much else happened today.  I practiced my viola and just got so upset that I was standing there playing scales with tears streaming down my cheeks.  That seems to happen a lot nowadays.  Probably not a good sign. *sigh*  But I did play my guitar last night, which calmed me down.  It's fun just to rock out on it and not care cuz you're just making it up as you go along.  Plus all the strings are tuned down a half-step so it sounds real mellow and cool... Rock on.      Ooh!  More good news!  I got an idea for a story last night!  Yay for me!  Made me happy.  All the ideas I've had recently have been for poems.  This one started out as a poem idea, but I know where to go with it to make it a short story.  It should rock.  I get to kill the main character!  YES!  Funny story... I took Creative Writing this year and for my mid-term, we had a bunch of choices, and I chose to do a short story cuz of the stuff I had to go with.  Well, I decided to be nice to my main character and let him live, even though it would've made more sense to kill him off.  My teacher had been telling me to be nicer to my characters.  But then she told me when she'd graded it and all that the ending wasn't so great and I said I'd go back and revise it.  I told her I'd just been trying to be nice to him (the character) and let him live.  She said it would've been better to kill him.  So I went back and killed him and she loved it.  Hah.  Great stuff.  But this death makes sense in the new story idea, so we'll just see how it goes.      And now I think that I shall go.  I hope that you all are doing well and that you sleep well and have a lovely tomorrow.  Farewell and adieu...

        Isnt that a great name for a band?!?!? Their song "Somebody Told Me" is really awesome. Rock on, Killers!       I was burning CD's for my relatives awhile ago and got so bored while they were copying that I started drawing on my hand... looks pretty wicked... It'd be cool to get tattooed on my hand... hmm.      Well, today I got up at 9, as usual, and we went to church. That was fun. My sister and I are always debating whether the choir director guy has a mustache or not. You cant really tell. Music was good today, so I was happy. The readings were joyous. And the priest was so funny. He's got this odd way of dragging words out at the end of his sentences and he kept saying "die" a lot... So with the way he talks, it was more like "diiiiiiieeeee.... *moment of silence*..." It was hysterical. We giggled. I felt kinda bad, but I get the giggles every so often in church and cant help it. I love God.      We also went out to go see The Bourne Supremacy today. It was different that I expected. The prievews and commercials for it were different from what the movie was actually about, in my opinion. But it was still good.      Just gonna add this... Thought it was interesting. Goodnight loves!        hand holding - you like to be in constant physical contact with your special someone but you don't want to take things too quickly.
