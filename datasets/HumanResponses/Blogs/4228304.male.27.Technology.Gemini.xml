      It never rains, it pours! Today is totally 2x of yesterday's unhappiness with the addtional stress with my wrong judgement call. Still, I've been motivated a little all by picking myself up, self-healing emotionally and mentally.  I've been thinking, I have to do this or else, how do I move on? If I can't even get pass myself, how do I get pass anything? I figured, in order to rebuild my status and reputation in my company, I've got to get back to that "original" Ian whom everbody asks everytime "How do you always manage to stay so chirpy and motivated ah?" That's what I must achieve back, in order to regain my status. Things are not looking bright now but, with my sheer determination, confidence and charisma, I will make it.  I'm gonna excel in my work, get a lot of attention, make the dough and achieve my goals! I will be there soon...   Today's dosage of mind pinchers: If you are already down, do not let it drag you down further.

      Its been a gruelling day since this morning... Got a call from office and I know, its gonna be major.  True to my expectations, I'm not spared of the music from my boss, losing credibility in my reputation and status and its a very very hard day to pass.  I pressed on but really needed support badly which there's no one there for me. Even the special appearance from her did not brighten me much.  I really need to get away from it all, voice myself and be heard. Its been my soft nature that matches with my competitive one, I'm friend's with disasters. I really need to get things right and strengthen myself.  So here's the daily dosage for mind pinchers: Never give up!

      Monday's finally almost over and with a brand new week, brand new mindset, I'm still the same old me.  Today's been great as I get to see this gorgeous damsel who's forever smelling so nice and its so torturing having to conceal my joy when she's around. Guess wat? I thought i over heard that she's might get married if only she had the dough, i.e she's attached!!! It took quite a part of me today and left me with quite an empty shell. Still, she didn't leave me behind when they are going out for dinner. Silently, I knew she had asked someone to ask me along... But I was too busy to even obliged... Dammit!  Still I've got to share this joy I'm still left with from yesterday. I took part in the Nike Real Run 2004 and completed it, 2nd time round. 1st time was the trial about a week back and yesterday, MAN, it was packed! I was at the end of the pack, had to weave through those in front and it took me a good few minutes to reach the pack where they are at my pace. Through this run, its funny that I'm always so different from the average people where I can excel in the part where they fail and I do badly in the part where they excel. Wassupwidat?!  As for my good old brudder, never hear from him today and I'm really to busy to disturb him or gotten any "greetings" from him. Think he must be sms-ing alot with his June and hey, remember? Its a brand new week, brand new beginning! I'm gonna pull thru this week, plan for some leave very soon and take a breather... Till then, here is today's mind pincher.  Today's dosage of mind pincher: Things are meant to be...

      Hey hey!  Never done this before but is influenced by my brudder(can be found at jordangoh.blogspot.com) to give this a try. Looks like its I'm still not too used to this blogging stuff yet.  But guess wat? I'm beginning to think the Friday the 13th is not that bad after all! I've got my conversion from a contract staff to a permanent staff! Congratulate me!  BTW, its a lazy saturday which I simply do not have a bloody idea what am I going to do today. As a single, its definite that I would be pining for that special someone to land in my arms anytime...  Till the next time, I will walk thru my life, especially my love life, blogging it.  Cherio
