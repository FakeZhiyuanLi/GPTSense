      Matt, I have a confession to make. While you were at the other table this morning in Physics, I stole your mints. I also gave some to Chelsea and Insha. Two each. I'm sorry. I have very fresh breath now, though, and I thank you and your mints for that.  I'm sorry about your mother, Insha. These are trying times for us teenagers and our bitchy parents. The week will go by quickly without your car (hey, my parents still haven't given the door to my room back, so I have to do the hand-wavy-over-chest move more often), and your parents will apologize for being too harsh on you. Just think ahead: a year and a half before you can say goodbye and whiz off to college. I think we can tolerate it for just a bit longer...as long as we're drunk half the time or something.  In other news. Hey looky-looky!: They updated the  urlLink TPHS Music Website . Lots of pictures of us playing, too. Ahhhh I'm really excited for the Six Flags Trip, so I'm going to compile a list of goals for the trip:   1) Climb the hotel roof again 2) Swim in the hotel pool 3) Meet a drunk middle aged man again, talk to him about gambling 4) Sneak in ******* 5) Buy more Mexican sweet bread and candy at a random Food -4- Less 6) Prank call ***** 7) Sneak out at night, play T or D 8) Ride X and Scream 9) Avoid Stink Boy 10) Avoid freshman bus, ride in cool people bus   Any suggestions to add to the list??

      Geez...I need to get out of this house for a while. My mom is absolutley insane. She is convinced that I'm lying to her when I tell her what grades I'm getting in my classes. If I told her I was failing everything she'd be more likely to believe me. Apparently she doesn't think that I'm working hard enough or doing enough extra work...bullshit. I'm so fucking overworked my head's going to explode. I guess in her mind, staying up late every night stressing out about tests or huge-ass essays due the next day is "not caring about my future". It's ridiculous. She's already forbidden me to drive for a week, and now she's made me give her all of my teachers' email addresses so she can "make sure" that my grades are what I say they are. I don't even know what other embarrassment she's going to put me through by the end of this year. And moreover, I don't know how much more she can. Maybe when she hears from my teachers that contrary to what she's assuming, I'm NOT failing all of my classes and I'm NOT getting all Bs and I DON'T have any C's. I have a B in Calc right now. That's all. So shoot me, I can't bring my grade up when there's only one frickin' test in it right now. Sorry for posting all of this crap you guys...I just need to vent really bad. Maybe I should go beat up my pillows or something. Too much stuff has happened in the last few months and I'm hoping that spring break is going to give my mind some peace. To Do: Study  Grapes of Wrath , do Bio chapter outline and show it to my mom so she can "be sure that at least I'm doing my homework" because I'm such a slacker and I never do anything. Maybe I should tell her that like I've only been to three days of school this quarter and that I haven't done any homework. That would be fun. See you people tomorrow.

      I'm going to bed now.  I talked with Steph for a few hours on the phone about where she wants to go to college, and guys, it's going to be a big decision for us.  I think it all has to do with figuring out who you are and what you want...  It reminded me of a conversation I had with my barber Bob a few days ago.  He was telling some metaphorical story, something like "So you start in Florida and you want to go to San Francisco, but after a little while, you think, 'Eh, San Francisco is kinda far, how about Las Vegas?,' but then after a bit you go 'Oh, Vegas is kinda far also, how about Texas?'"  Naturally, I interpreted the moral of the story to be  Don't settle for anything less than what you want  (I mean, come on,  Texas ?).  But apparently, the moral was that  you can always change your mind .  He started talking about how people who had set goals and pursued goals somehow ended up happier, even if they changed what they were pursuing.  The more I think about it, the more I think its true.  It feels like we're pressured to know who we are come senior year, and then market that to colleges, and relatives, and everyone.  This seems to get everyone all freaked out about making the  wrong  decision.  But I guess what Bob was saying is that you are allowed to change your mind, but you will miss opportunities if you don't pursue anything for fear of pursuing the wrong thing.  Anyone agree?  G'night.

      Matt, you'll love  Gatsby  if my instincts are correct. What a great book that was. Yeah the Bio test today kicked my ass. However the English wasn't particularly hard...just long as hell. It was expected.  You guys may want to use this in the future: Sleeping in several small intervals alternating doing work is much better than doing all of your work and then sleeping. It lets you stay up later without feeling as tired. However, by the end of school you still want to sleep from now till Christmas.  Did anyone watch the speech John Kerry gave at UCSD? Very, very good. He was just here two days ago. If Bush gets re-elected then I'm moving to Bermuda.   In other news, I haven't done my calc homework yet and am not feeling greatly inspired to do so anytime soon. I guess it'll be another calc day in physics. Groan. I want to visit colleges on spring break...probably just the close UCs. Heather, Matt...think you guys would be interested? Don't want to go alone or with my momma.  Okie dokie, I'm exhausted. I think I'll go sleep.  Love you guys. :)

      Fallen for a relative...Insha? What is zees? Hahaha. Wellllllllllllllll, like you said Matt, today we had a lovely sub in History, so not much happened this morning during first period, but we did watch some very interesting documentaries about WWII. In Music Theory we reviewed for the test and then sang some excerpts from  Carmina Burana,  this time with the recording we did last week during Band (I've never played an instrument and sung at the same time!). And in English, we had a wonderful essay test on  Grapes of Wrath,  for which I wrote six full pages and took me over two hours. And that's only part one! Joy. But I must say it again, the ending to that book was GNARLY as fuck. I'll never get over it, I swear. So the busybody bitch that I got into an accident with yesterday called my house THREE times today and left TWO messages on the answering machine. The total damage comes to $126 after she simply went to her dealer and had the plastic on the bumper replaced. How absolutely devastated she must be. Bitch. I'm delighted that you behaved so well in front of my mother today, Matt. She thinks you're a (")good kid.(") That's just SWELL!! Let's just canonize you, ya little bastard! Well, I'm looking forward to tomorrow in Physics, Matt, on the condition that you remember to bring your digital camera. We have big plans for this here blog of ours. Can't wait to start snapping some photos and making a real layout, baby.

      This blog is going to be incredible.  So today...  Art history was mostly fun.  We talked for an hour about not posting pictures of your drunken and stoned self on the internet, which, apparently, some people decided to do.  I guess they are on the volleyball team, because Trupe said somebody from LCC sent the pictures and the link of the album to him, Anne Meigs, and Schmitt.  He mused at how somebody could possibly drink and smoke at the same time.  Hmm.  US History was pretty boring.  When we first came into class, it smelled so gross, and Nathan suggested that Mr. Evans had died in our classroom.  We had a subsitute and she laughed at how we were all crowded around the open window.  There was a video on the Cold War, but I read Great Gatsby instead.  That book is going to be so good; I really feel like I'm getting into it.  I miss reading a lot.  Journalism sucked.  That's okay, though, cause I went in the pub and did my own stuff until everyone was done.  Convention is going to be great... I get excited about things like this.  I'm so into journalism.  After school Nick and I went to Jamba, then Quizznos, then the beach, then Vons (where we ran into Heather's mom) and that was all.  And here I am, finding myself typing away on my computer.  I'm so glad school is pretty much over after tomorrow, but I'm so scared about calculus.  I need to turn my fear into motivation and not let it paralyze me, cause that would just not be good.  Es todo.

      Hey you guys :) Heather it looks great. Hooray for HTML. It was so pretty today...shame that we couldn't get to the beach. Definetely bad that we have to be caged up in classrooms while the weather's like this.  I'm scared about this summer...with all the crap that has to get done I don't even know if there's going to be free time :( Miracosta for Government and Econ...Portugal festival for 2 weeks...Greece...college visits? I don't know. I want to have a summer like the ones in elementary school when summer would actually seem too long. Time just goes so much faster now, doesn't it? The years are flying by. I keep having to stop and remind myself that I need to have a good time and not stress so much that I ruin each year, each day, each minute...can't do them over again, can I? This post is making me feel older than I should feel :) Anyway. I promise myself that I will do homework faster from now on and sleep early every night. I'd forgotten how good a full night's rest felt...perhaps a lingering side effect of Chem? But I can really see how freshman year I could get away with doing my Carrillo homework and French workbook crap right before class and not stressing out about it. The only times when I freak out in school are a result of not letting my brain rest enough. Hey, it's a muscle too. Haha. Well, as of right now, I have to study/read/take notes on three chapters of Bio (one of which I do not understand in the least), do a lab, and organize some PALs stuff.  It's gonna be another long night. (Which means more late-night frantic panic-stricken convos with Leela...and her calling me at 12:30 to ask if it's too late to call my house :D)  Good times, good times.      I love you guys. Bonsoir.

      SHE'S ALIVE!!! AHAHAHAHA!! OK, where do we start with this bitch? I'll start with a brief on Physics today because this seems to be the theme of this blog in association with Insha and Matt (since we all sit at the same little table in Physics class). Let's see...didn't pay much attention in class again as usual, made fun of D's stupid facial expressions with Matt, brought an assortment of food to class (Hawaiian sweet bread, Pop-tarts, yogurt smoothie, naked juice, and a Balance Gold bar) so that I wouldn't be jealous of Howard and his abundance of food again, watched a video about waves, and studied for a math test that took place the following period. And today was unbearable weather...it was hotter than a fried burrito grilling on your mother's ass. It didn't help when the air conditioner decided to break down in the band room. On a happier note today, I got into my first car accident ever! Woohoo...in the CVMS parking lot, I was in line behind this lady who appeared to be moving forward, so I stepped on the gas. She braked very suddenly, and before I knew it, there was a car's ass in my face. She got out of the car with a bitchy look on her face, started cussing, yelling, and scolding me for hurting her car, and said, "You BETTER have insurance!" Right. Apparently she just got her car back from the repair shop after she was rear-ended in another accident a few weeks ago. Coincidence? I think not. Obviously, there's something fucky with her driving. So I handled the situation calmly, was very apologetic, and we exchanged information. Damage? Not a scratch on my car. A small outline of my license plate on her bumper. But she enjoyed venting her anger on me and cussing me out, so if she enjoys being that melodramatic, whatever. So that's my humble attempt at picking up some momentum in this blog. Hopefully since it's the three of us now, we can motivate each other enough to create a worthy blog. Howdy doo!  Post-script: I would like to point out something that has pissed me off forever. There is NO SUCH WORD as "NUCULAR." IT DOES NOT EXIST. The word is "nuclear," the pronunciation is "NEW-CLEAR," and not "NEW-KYOO-LER." Where in the fuck did that come from? I've noticed both students and teachers alike saying it like that. Not good. Stop.

      Wow.  Time to start posting, man.    I think this will be a good week.  Journalism convention this week should be exciting, but it's going to take a lot of gas.  I can't count the number of times I'm going to need to drive down to Fashion Valley and back in the coming days.  But, apparently, LeeAnn will keep me company.  I love LeeAnn a lot.  Today was great.  Really nice and warm.  College on the east coast would really be difficult for me, I'm thinking, just because I work best with all this sun.  I miss Chuck in physics.  He was such a part of that class, and now he's gone.  Well good for him, Chuck has always been good at doing what he wants.  Then there was English.  Haha that class is so funny with Brunk's interpretations of the books we read.  He spots the sexual undertones in everything.  At lunch I talked with Brenna about stuff, and that was good.  Calc wasn't too bad.  Chowdury was so nice about my scheduling this week.  I told her she was preparing us more than any other teacher for the AP test, but she didn't believe me.  She really is a great teacher with how much she takes care of us.  After school was hours of e-mailing and filling out applications.  I'm going to have a killer summer, and hopefully all this stuff will pay off.  Besides, I'm kind of having fun pretending to be a professional.  My mind is swimming, but I don't think that will last too long.  Time always makes me feel different about things.

      Told my parents that the rehearsal today started right after school, so went to Convoy with Chelsea Patrick Alex Chris and made it back by 4. Alive. That's skill. And Chris is a wuss because he got scared when he learned that I talk to myself while driving. Constantly. But yeah, I had an epiphany on the way there and realized that I knew exactly where it is. My dad and brother and I go to this Indian place off Clairemont Mesa Blvd. all the time, and where we went was about a minute from there.  It's free scoop night at Baskin Robbins. 6-10 pm. And I'm kinda stuck here right now. Maybe go later.  Bye all. P.S. I'm sick of APs and everything to do with them, tests included.

      Oy.  I just took one of the hardest math tests of my life.  Oh well, it's over...  So Art History lecture went well, and then I came home to sleep for 3rd.  So, of course, the doorbell rings at liek 11:30, and, who else would it be?  Nick.  We talked for about 10 minutes and then he left and I tried to get some more sleep.  In Journalism we sat around and did nothing during interviews.  I'm going on Friday.  Yay!  Now...it's time to write that English essay on "love," study for the Physics Quiz, and finish the portfolio.  Laters.

      Chiclets are really good. I should chew this type of gum more often. I never knew they came in strawberry breeze flavor, so I got excited and stuffed six of them into my mouth.  Today was kind of a drag. Everybody's stress is overflowing into my own, and now it's driving me nuts. All of a sudden, people are panicking about AP Tests, SATs coming up, finals, author projects, etc. We actually have only six weeks of school left, believe it or not...but the worst is yet to come. So much shit is taking place at once, not only academically concerned. SHIT, I CAN'T WAIT FOR SUMMER!! Oh yeah--that will be filled with college prep shit, too. Lucky us.  What's exciting about today? No homework! (Well, technically.) I need a break after writing for the author project last night and doing that stupid History outline for the lazy, selfish dimwits in History who so  conveniently  forgot to do their parts today! Now we're left with less study material for the final on Friday. People are so fucking thoughtful sometimes, it makes tears well up in my eyes. So anyway, I'm planning on getting some well-deserved shut eye tonight after my 2:30am rendez-vous last night and the 6:30am awakening to make up the rest of a test this morning. Sleep deprivation isn't going to help much with my stress, so I'll do as much as I can to at least stay awake in class. Until next time.

      I'll say--we really need to hang out with my RB people more often, Matt. Now you know why I love Amber so much. It was so nostalgic seeing all those familiar streets, condominiums, and businesses. The best of all was driving past my old preschool. Ah, the memories, the memories. We are definitely heading back sometime soon, and this time, with more people.  By the way, Matteo: you're a man ****. ;)

      Hello my beautiful friends!  I have caught a moment of spare time in the week of hellish work, and I am celebrating yet another issue of The Falconer.  Well, not celebrating yet, but at least the special section is done, and when you see it Thursday, I hope you all like it.  I believe you'll find the topic very appropos, and you may even find yourselves quoted as anonymous sources.  Hmm.  Evans didn't have me do my Zinn report today, so I was three hours short of sleep for nothing.  However, I did come in during fifth to get that damn DBQ done.  So I'm finally caught up in History...oh, no, wait...test next class.  I want to sleep.  We'll see how long this English takes me.

      I'm in PALs right now...in the computer lab. I hate Mr. Posner. I like the new Snapple lime green tea. And that's about all I have to say. Except I love you all. K bye.

      For some reason, I find myself tonight a little bored without any homework to do. Not to say that I  could  very well be working on something important right now to catch up in school, but I think it's important to take a break every once and a while from the usual grind. So instead, I've been enjoying myself by practicing flute, downloading music, and thinking of ideas for my composition in Music Theory. I guess you could say music helps a lot when it comes to calming me down and helping me unwind.  These past few days haven't been the best--it seems as though everyone I know has some sort of personal crisis going on right now. Strangely enough, I've been hearing a lot about people's animals (pets) dying. And there are so many other things that I want to address. I wish I could just help everyone. I don't like to see my friends looking worn out and unhappy. But like Azaam said last night, maybe I should just offer to listen, because that's the best thing a friend can do for another friend. I'll try to fulfill that resolution. Another goal I have this year is to restore amends with people who haven't exactly gotten along with me this year (namely...well, some of you know who I'm talking about). I've come to the conclusion that there's no point in having beef with other people. It's so much harder to hate than to be kind and friendly to other people. So hopefully I can muster the guts to confront those few people.  Here's a few things I also wanted to say outloud:  * Insha and Matt, congratulations on qualifying for NMS!! YOU SMART PEOPLE!!  * Insha, congrats on "you-know-what" (wink, wink, wink)  * Natasha, I am very very sorry about your dog. I'll be praying for him.  * Azaam, here's your fucking place in the blog.  * Karin, beautiful piece you made.  * Dream, Rachel, dream (wink)  * Have you looked at your calendar lately? Think about what tomorrow is.  That should do it!!!!

      Wow, last night was fun.  So...after working all day, I partied all night.  I don't really remember a lot of it.  I danced with a lot of people, shook hands with a lot of people, rubbed elbows with the wealthy.  Somehow we all ended up in a hotel room, then Ariel's car, and home.  I just woke up with about...uh...zero memory of it.  Just what I needed.

      Oh, what a week. Today was nice though. I usually have chamber music and then a lesson following it, but my lesson was cancelled today. I "forgot" to tell my parents that I didn't have the lesson, so I had an hour and a half of freedom. I was thinking of calling someone and doing something, but instead I just drove around Del Mar and up the 101 for an hour. I'm completely refreshed. It was nice and rainy and clean. It's strange, though, this is the first time I've realized how many songs say the word "rain" in them. I was listening to a CD with 16 songs on it, and 13 of them mentioned rain. So I guess it was fitting. I love having occasional alone time. Never get it at home. I'm in a really good mood right now...I'm gonna ride the wave and go read or something in my room. :)

      So I get home today, and I'm completely exhausted after staying up until 3am last night studying a bunch of rubbish for the Physics quiz today on waves. What's a girl to do? I did exactly what my body told me to do: I went straight to my bed and slept. Flash forward to parents arriving home and preparing dinner. While I was dreaming, my family had dinner without me. No announcement on the intercom, no coming up to wake me up for supper. So I wake up to discover my internet disconnected. Why? Because I slept through dinner. Gee, what a lovely surprise!*  Parents are so fucking irrational.  Aside from the shit that gets rubbed in my face at home, school isn't helping to lower my blood pressure or stress level. I really think I'm going to opt out for the Physics AP exam. Why waste my time on something I know I won't do well on? I'd prefer to focus on my other AP tests and do well in those areas instead. Plus, it's one less thing to stress over in my life. I'm already shitting bricks the size of SUVs. In addition to AP tests, I also have SATs to worry about (which I'm retaking in June), SAT IIs, a summer job, a summer camp to attend, scholarships, college, my GPA, and community service activities. Forgive me if I sound like a transcript junky.  Deviating from subjects related to academics, I'm excited for tomorrow--TGIF!! I'm probably going to buy tickets for the Mr. TPHS Dance. Matt and Insha, you must come along. I also think Leela, Annie, Rachel, and some others might tag along, too. I'm disappointed that there will only be two groups performing for Airbands because I've missed it every year until now due to coinciding swim meets. The one year I get to see it, nobody signs up for it. Too bad. But I'm sure the combination of the performances and the dance will be interesting.  On a final note: For  anybody  interested in seeing a spectacular, amazing, beautiful performance of the famous  Carmina Burana,  I have the date, time, and location available:  Sunday, May 2nd  at  7:00PM  at the JCC La Jolla. It's a very famous, renown piece by Carl Orff (if you care to download it at your disposal). The TPHS Wind Ensemble, String Orchestra, Choir, and AP Music Theory class will be performing it in one large group. Invite anyone you want, and get cultured!  *In case anybody is wondering how I made this post with my internet disconnected...my brother let me borrow his laptop with wireless internet.

      And so I can put off my US history for a little bit while I post...  I got accepted to the summer journalism program I applied to at Northwestern.  At first I was really excited, and I still am, but then I realized that there are some people that I am really, really going to miss.  I'll be gone for five weeks, and then probably another for college visits, and that leaves me with five weeks at home spread out with two before I leave and three after.  I know that all the seniors are going to leave sometime, but it's getting here so quickly.  There are some people that I haven't gone 24 hours without seeing since the beginning of the year, and when they graduate, that will pretty much be it.  Senior year will be exciting, and I'm sure it's going to be fun, but I really like my life and the people in it right now.  I hadn't given much thought to the idea of not talking to these important people regularly; not seeing them at school, or outside of school.  I'm excited for them, and I hope they make new friends, but I will really miss them, and adjusting to life without them seems like it's going to be tough.

      Apparently, we have a viewing audience.  Sick.  It was a pretty good day.  Art history was nothing...I'm getting tired of everything sounding like bullshit in that class.  Even so, very little work to do, which is nice considering there is so much shit in every other class.  US History was boring, but I wouldn't know since I didn't actually go.  Instead I came home and...took a nap.  Journalism was, well...journalism.  After school I raced off to my interview and got it!  Starting this summer, I'm a Coast News intern. It seems like a really cool publication, but the editor is a young woman who sounds like she isn't out to be your buddy.  I showed her all my work, and she seemed happy enough with it.  I think I'm going to start writing a lot more news stories to get myself prepared for this summer.  After the interview, I came back to school for litmag, which was...productive.  All the yearbook kids were freaking out about their interviews for editorships.  Anyway, I drove Mela to her car and we talked for a while about everything.  She is a really great person.  So now, what's left to do?  That whole plan to get everything done is caving in, because I just don't have enough sleep in my system to do it all.  Oh well.  I'm going to go catch some TV/eat dinner...then maybe a nap...then physics.

      It's laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate. I just got done with a long-ass bio outline. 7 pages. Not right in the least. And yeah...the English was hell as usual. Now, at 2 in the morning, I'm left with the fucking Teen Issue Presentation for PALs. Irony of ironies, it's on STRESS AND STRESS RELIEF. It'll be great tomorrow while we're talking to people about how not to be stressed and I'm standing up there looking like a crackhead. I should actually try to DO some of the stuff that I'm finding, but no. Instead I'm stressing about...a stress presentation. PALs sucks in this aspect. We're supposed to counsel people. Not present to classes of students what they don't care to hear in the first place. Staring at a computer screen used to make me very tired, but it has woken me up a little. Maybe it's just the temperature downstairs. It's so hot in my room...or maybe it's just the coffee I drank up there. I don't know. Either way, tomorrow will be a tired day. Thank goodness I'll only have the Physics to do. Man, this year is wearing me out. I picked up some more prep books today...4 in total, I think. The lady at Barnes and Noble was like "Cram time?" Affirmative.  Good night, all. Or rather good morning. Whatever.

      Haven't posted in a while, but I haven't really had much of an interesting weekend. Sad, since Spring Break is over after tomorrow.  On Thursday, my mom gave me this "advanced screening" movie ticket for two to see the movie "Mean Girls," which doesn't come out for a little while, I presume. It's a Lindsay Lohan movie and it's one of those teenage melodramas, so to be completely honest, I wasn't expecting too much out of it. So I invited Chelsea to come with me and see it, and we were both pleasantly surprised. The movie contains pretty original humor and we were shocked at how the high school portrayed has such an  uncanny  resemblance to Torrey Pines and the shit that takes place there. It was quite a treat, and I'd recommend the movie to any TP students. Afterward we went to a nearby sushi bar, where I had real sushi for the first time (I usually eat the pre-packaged stuff)!  On Friday, I did nothing except lounge around at Red Robin, and later came home and watched "The Exorcist" for the trillionth time with my mom. Not a very interesting day.  Today, my mom woke me up at 8:00 to go running with her like I had promised earlier in the week. We ended up running 3.3 miles near some trail by the Jewish Academy and the 56. I nearly died since I haven't exerted myself so much in about a year. But I think I'm going to start running like that more often, since I need to shave off about ten pounds (eek). My dad has been up in Oregon for my great-grandma's memorial service (I didn't know her very well), so my mom, brothers, and I went to Fashion Valley to poke around for a while on our own. Got a nice new pair of white Steve Madden sandals. When we got home, Matt came over to visit for a little while and pick up the Physics homework. We had a good chat about SATs, colleges, and school projects (as usual), and he's going to help me get into my "dream college!" Woohoo!  And now I've run out of things to discuss.

       Why Did The Chicken Cross The Road?    ANSWER:    Pat Buchanan:  To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.   Louis Farrakhan:  The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed the "black man" in order to trample him and keep him down.   The Bible:  And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken,"Thou shalt cross the road." And the chicken crossed the road, and it was good.   Colonel Sanders:  I missed one?   L.A. Police Department:  Give us five minutes with the chicken and we'll find out.   Richard M. Nixon:  The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did NOT cross the road. I don't know any chickens. I have never known any chickens.   Dr. Seuss:  Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes! The chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I've not been told!   Ernest Hemingway:  To die. In the rain.   Martin Luther King, Jr.:  I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.   Grandpa:  In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. If someone told us that the chicken crossed the road, that was good enough for us.   Aristotle:  It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.   Karl Marx:  It was an historical inevitability.   Ronald Reagan:  What chicken?   Captain James T. Kirk:  To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.   Fox Mulder:  You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens have to cross before you believe it?   Bill Gates:  I have just released Chicken '98, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook, and Explorer is an inextricable part of the operating system.   Einstein:  Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the chicken?   Bill Clinton:  I DID NOT cross the road with THAT chicken.

      I'm tired and bored and afraid of ghosts and paranoid and I can't sleep yet but I'm tired as fuck. Someone help me and give me sleeping pills! I'm emotionally drained. I can't take this. Where are people when you need them at 2:13AM? Come on, seriously. Everyone was just a bitch tonight. This is not encouraging when it comes to being compatable with other human beings. I don't even know what I'm talking about. Leela, I need some more of your grief counseling. I also need sleep, water, and food. Someone please throw me a bone here.

      You guys. They mixed green apple AND orange. I kid you not. I asked them. So...you're both right. Or you're both wrong. :) Bonfires are fun. But the hookah saved the day. Night. I found it sad that I didn't know of the places that the people were from...not even their schools. San Diego is such a big place. We should go exploring more. Damn I slept so much yesterday night. I think the beach tired me out or something cause I was out cold until 11 in the morning. I'm gonna go make some iced tea. Catch ya later.

      Yeah, the bonfire last night was half worth it. I applaud Leela for her efforts, and most of the people we met there were nice and cool to talk to, but the youngins there were getting on my nerves. So were the slutty girls that were putting out in front of the Persians. Met some pretty nice people, and I appreciated the marshmallows and the hookah (which was green apple flavored, not orange, Matt). Gotta try that stuff more often. Oooh! And they said I could pass for a Persian girl! How's that for being ethnic, EH, MATT?!?!  Well today, I've been bored stiff again...watching stupid MTV bullshit reruns and putting off getting dressed and out of my PJs. I think I'll go do that and decide how to make the most of this Wednesday afternoon, evening, and night.

      Hey guys!  Today was fun.  Got up and had a long litmag meeting with Lauren and Nick where we picked all the fonts and stuff.  It's going to look so great when it's all put together.  Afterwards, I read  Gatsby  outside, and then Nick and I went for a hike at the beach.  We got this great idea for the cover of litmag, and I guess the plan is to pursue it tomorrow at 9 with Mela.  So I came home tired and screwed around for a bit, then I went and met Heather and Insha at the beach with some Persian dudes and some people from school and Leela, who is the best.  Waited around for the hookah to arrive, and it was pretty worth it.  It was like orange flavored and very mellow.  Well anyway, now it's tomorrow and I need to sleep for all the work I've got to do tomorrow.  Later.

      Today's been pretty good so far. Woke up late, beat up my brother for singing songs out of tune and teasing me (the older one, of course), got dressed, and then took Christopher to the park to play. Strangely enough, we met a lady there who had two sons named Matthew and Christopher. Now what are the odds of that? But those names are also pretty common, and they're both Christian names, so I guess it's not that unlikely.  After that I took Christopher out for some Baskin Robbins ice cream, and now I'm here, more bored than ever. Anyone up for hanging out tonight?

      Yes, Matt, you'd BETTER make it up to us. We missed you. And also your mom probably thinks we're nuts because we showed up ay your door without you being home. Haha.  You guys I just finished this book by Al Franken,  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them:  A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right. Please borrow it from me. You'll love it...this guy is incredibly good.  Matt, congrats on winning first in the nation! I'm so proud of you people :-) Yeah we really should go to Fashion Valley more often. With you, Fratt Manks. You need our help to get summer clothing.  You guys...we must get to the beach. It's supposed to be very nice and sunny for this week. Mff, not too much time to write right now. Will post later. Guests coming over. Cya.

      And so I find myself here, when all other lights are out...  I satisfied my post-convention-lack-of-sleep and woke up just after the awards ceremony.  Nick and I met Lauren for a litmag meeting at the Pannikin and we got a ton of stuff done.  Sorry that I missed hanging out with you guys, and sorry for not calling when my plans were redirected.  I'll make it up to you.  While I was buying coffee, the lady told me that my money was counterfeit, and I was definitely not in the state of mind to get the joke. I probably would have been pissed off any other time, but it was funny.  Afterward, I came home and chilled until Steph came over and we went to dinner in La Jolla.  We found this nice Mexican restaurant, Alfonsos, and I had a carne asada quesadilla, which was pretty damn good.  We wandered into an art gallery and I tripped out looking at all the artwork of the ocean and dolphins.  One of the artists was even there and insisted that he take his painting into the viewing gallery for us so that we could see it in the proper lighting.  I've decided that I should take every opportunity I can to get the most out of the people I'm around.  Convention got me in the spirit to start conversations with anybody and everybody, and I have to say I like it.  I came home and watched 'The Paper Chase' with my dad.  It's a pretty interesting film about this law student and his first year at Harvard.  Even though it was made in the 70s, most of the shots were pretty contemporary, minus, of course, the fashion styles.  It had a lot of good themes and my dad and I talked about it for a little bit afterward.  I really like that we can relate on films and have good conversations when there are other things that we never, ever talk about.  So after milling around the internet in some unresolved quest, talking to Leela, one of my favorite people in the world, and finally finding myself here, I think I'll be going to bed now.  G'night.

      I have to admit I'm a little disappointed in you, Matt, but I'm not going to be petty and hold a grudge. You've blown me off quite a bit in the past three days, and today especially, but I won't transition into Super Bitch Mode and ignore you. Just  please  stick to your word and CALL if something comes up suddenly so that you don't have people worrying and waiting for you. And that's all. I still love you, GB.  Insha and I did have a really great time at Fashion Valley, though. The two of us haven't been there together in about two years, but we made the very best of it and I don't know about you, Insha, but I think I want to make more frequent trips to this place. Except the parking is horrendous to say the least. A lady and her daughter were yelling obscenities at me and mouthing the word "bitch" just because I passed their car while they were straightening out in a parking spot. Hostile female shopping zombies. After we finally found a parking spot, we shopped around in Brass Plum and I bought two cute shirts there (one Hurley horizontal-striped t-shirt and one red tank top), and three new belts (turtle belt, flower belt, frog belt), all very cute. Then we went to this weird drink "joint" where the people are very lively and force you to take a sip of the drink and tell them you like it before you leave. I had a yummy lemonade slushy and Insha had boba. Then we went to Victoria's Secret where Insha bought a pretty orange tank top with flowers, and after that we went to Sephora and ate some delicious makeup (yes, they have edible makeup now). Then we wrapped it up with some purchases of new earrings, keychains, candy chapsticks, hair accessories, and necklaces at Claire's (a store we're starting to like again). All in all, quite fun. And we didn't get lost on the 163, thank God, but I had one "near accident" trying to change lanes on Friars Road. Made it home safely.  Now? I'm bored as hell. Talking it up online with a few people, ate some good homemade hamburgers for dinner, and might watch a movie sometime later tonight. Oh yes, at 10:30  tonight * MTV has that "I Want a Famous Face" episode of the chick who wants to look like Pamela Lee Anderson. Definitely have to watch that freaky shit. What would I ever do without trashy television?  All right, I'm signing out. Happy Daylight Savings/Palm Sunday (for the Christian folk)!  *Apparently it's tomorrow night. Poo. :(

      Hey there.  Just got back from the Janice Pai Foundation Luncheon, and that was something pretty special.  I hung around with Michelle and Jessica and Brett most of the time, and finally got to meet Mr. Pai.  I didn't realize that so many different projects were funded by the foundation, and I also didn't know that most of the money comes from the Pai family themselves.  It's something to think about everytime Junior Journalists feels too difficult to handle.  I guess I'm serving on the Board next year, and I'm glad.  Janice Pai... I didn't even know her, but that girl and her family are pretty amazing people.

Throughout most of the movie these people are freezing because of this storm thing and you feel cold too. I'm still shivering.  Heather and Matt: we will go shopping on Monday. Don't forget.

      I just went through one of the most difficult experiences ever--and this is only the prelude to the hardest part. Tonight was the Awards Ceremony for the entire TP Music Department, and it was one of the most heartfelt events I've ever been to.  I played in four pieces composed by students from music theory: Karin's, Sujin's, Zach's, and Sarah's. They went more or less pretty well, and Karin's and Sarah's especially stood out. They were so beautifully written. We really have some talented musicians/composers in our program.  So the pieces went by pretty smoothly (a few screw-ups for here and there, I was a bit flustered), and Insha played  beautifully  as usual for Sarah's piece. Her piece was very special because she titled it "For Tomorrow" and dedicated it to all of the people in band. It was very appropriate and nostalgic. Then came the awards sprinkled throughout, and the awards were very fitting for people who definitely deserved them.  Then came the sentimental portion of the ceremony. Mr. Kohn delivered a wonderful speech about changes in life. As some of you might know, this is his last year at Torrey Pines after dedicating five years to rebuilding the former non-existent music program. He's been such a wonderful teacher, in fact, the best teacher I've ever had in my life. These past four years have been a blessing, and I mean that in the most genuine respect. He's always encouraged me to do my best, he's shown us what music is all about, he's extremely passionate about music, he's comforted me when I've cried over the years, he reminds me what's really important in life, and he's so talented at what he does. He's made such an incredible program, and we all have so much affection for him. There wasn't one student in that room that didn't feel incredibly grateful and affectionate for that man. Insha and I started crying. I don't know about anyone else, but I just couldn't stop sobbing because it's almost over. Four years of hard work, dedication, love, friendship, and it's all changing and going away. I'll never forget what all of this has taught me. It's definitely affected me for the rest of my life, and it's one of the things in life that I will look back on as extremely significant. I can't imagine how I'm going to be at graduation; that's the last time the entire ensemble will be playing together, and that's it. I'm going to be bawling my eyes out.  Man, what a night.

      Back from the prom.  This evening was really, very fantastic.  I am so fortunate to know such wonderful, amazing people.  I picked up Steph at around 6, but not before the semi-awkward photo-session with her parents.  I'm pretty used to it, though, and I've even come to like it.  We met up with Anand and Jen and then we were off to Horton Plaza in our "limo" (Lincoln Navigators are totally in, by the way).  On the way there, we watched Monster's Inc., which was perfect, and Anand and Jen used their super brains to get the sound working.  Anand picked a great restaurant for us, the Nappa Valley Grille, and it was really very perfect.  It was cool to walk around Horton Plaza in our formal clothing while everyone admired Steph and Jen.  The food was great and we made our way to the prom.  It was so great to see everyone all dressed-up.  We have quite an attractive school, I must say.  I loved the dancing, too.  After a few hours of that, we headed back to Carmel Valley, and I dropped Steph off at home and went to a surprisingly wonderful beach bonfire.  I got to roast marshmallows.  I haven't done that in a really long time.  Nico, Max, Paul, Florence, Laura, Emily... there were more, but I didn't know everyone's name.  They were all incredibly nice, and it really made me feel good.  I just roasted marshmallows and felt like a little kid again, back when we used to go camping with my cousins all the time.  When Simon and Garfunkel's "America" came on, I was in heaven.  So now I'm home, checking out some of the photos, and writing all this down in the hopes that if I'm down in the coming days (I'm not planning on it, but it could happen), I can look back on this and appreciate it.  Heather and Insha: We are going to kick Prom 2005's ass, and have an amazing time together.  I love you both so much.  G'night.

      This week has been such a bitch, and it was pleasant to see it end in a nicer way than I had anticipated. Heather, I had so much fun tonight. I think it was good that the movie was sold out because we needed time to talk like bitchy girlfriends. From the Coffee Bean to the beach to Del Mar to all the way up the 101, it was just one of those nights that you know you're going to miss when you're older and thinking about high school. By the way, I'd like to say that I'm completely over Torrey Pines. I understand why everyone thinks that this school sucks. An overwhelming portion of the people that go here are either snobby people from Del Mar or pretentious bitches from CV...and Heather, you made a good point when you said that people think that we haven't changed since 7th grade. I don't know what it is about this area or the community, but the longer I'm here the more uncomfortable and cold it seems to me. I really used to wish that I had grown up here from when I was really little, but now I'm glad I haven't been a Del Mar person my whole life cause I don't like how they turn out at all. And that kind leads into our evil plan with the RB people and what we're gonna accomplish (haha) over the summer. Which reminds me: I'm really looking forward to this summer. This'll be the first time since 4th grade that I get to spend a summer at home. I'm sad that I'm not going to see any hot Greek boys, but I've never spent a full summer in California and hopefully I'll get to take full advantage of it. And the driving privileges will surely come in handy. Notes to self: must buy Cookie Monster lunchbox.                must go exploring more.                must try heroin by the end of the summer. (KIDDING! :P)  Yeah I'm pretty tired. But the ocean air made me feel really happy and I've had a really good day (and the coffee didn't hurt). Which worries me, because I think my brain's in summer mode already, and that means that I probably won't accomplish anything for the remainder of school. Actually, I think that's a good thing.   Love, Enchilada  P.S.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I hope our plans for the end-of-school thing will work out. Note to Heather and me: Charthouse. :)

      Long time no talk, sorry. I've been so overwhelmed with shit lately, then again, I've been having a lot of fun. Six Flags was a blast, but I don't feel like writing out an entire synopsis of the trip, so if you want to hear it in complete detail, you can go to Azaam's LiveJournal and read his summary of it here:  urlLink Six Flags Trip . In other news, STAR testing this week is a BITCH. What a complete load of rubbish. We sit around and answer lame-ass questions that don't have any benefits for us whatsoever except for some stupid API index rating, which won't even be happening this year since only about 60% of the students showed up to actually take the test. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. So today, we had testing until 12 for some asinine reason, so Matt, Robin, and I left an hour into it and went to Einstein Brother's and UTC for two full hours. (And Matt bought some nice clothes, right, Matt??) We made it back in perfect timing for first period. Hey, it's ten times more productive than  sitting around in school.  Also: Happy (Belated) Birthdays to Leela and Annie!! Congrats on turning seventeen, you guys--now go watch a raunchy, violent movie! Oh oh oh and here is Leela's  BEAUTIFUL  prom picture from the RB prom:     Doesn't she look like a model?? Leela you are sooo pretty, my Indian chica! I hope you had a great time! ;)

      Hey everyone.  Well today was a low-key day back.  Physics was...physics.  Sorry to hear about how sick everyone got from the eggs at Six Flags, but CONGRATULATIONS on all your awards.  The band program has come along so far, and after seeing your concert, I know you were incredible.  English was...also low-key.  I read all of "Their Eyes Were Watching God" over the weekend, so I could actually participate in our activities.  Boring though.  Heather and I went to Jamba Juice at lunch and I got the new enlightened smoothie... Berry Fulfilling I think?  It was actually very good.  Made it back in time for a sub in math, where I think I did absolutely nothing productive but talk to Meryl, Julia and Jenna.  That was fun, and "Mean Girls" is officially the best movie.  Came home and went off to Gary's Tux shop to get my tuxedo.  Since Steph's dress is black and white, I got myself a super black and white tux, and I think it will be a good step up from the band tux I wear every year.  So now I'm just sitting here, making the rest of those plans for prom.  I think the most important thing is that we have a fun time, and don't get caught up in all the drama and shit that can always find itself appearing at school dances.  Later!

      So we're all out of town, it would seem.  Hope Six Flags is going well!  Well Berkeley was fun, I'll probably write more about it later.  Lots of family drama, but I think it all went alright.  One more night in LA, and I'm coming home on the train tomorrow evening.  Talk to you all then.

      A few minutes ago, I picked up the phone. It was Agrim, one of my brother's band people. The other members of the band were already at our house.  Me: "Hello?" Agrim: "Hey is Nikita there?" (I run to the garage) Me: "YOU GUYS, it's Agrim..." Richie, loudly into the phone: "AGRIM, YOU LOOK LIKE A PHONE!!!"  oooooh that made my day. hahaha.

      This is so cool! Blogger got a makeover! Now it's all fancy-shmancy...how spiffy.  Today was so awesome with Insha at the beach, plus, I got a little more tan and some good exercise from that 30 minute walk to the mini tidepool area. Also, I think my Mother's Day gift for today definitely takes the cake: instead of your ordinary gift such as cooking up a nice breakfast or making some homemade craft for my mom, I spent an hour cleaning up cat shit this morning. That's right--cat shit. My cats have issues and this whole year they've been turding outside of the litter box in the garage, so as a gift to my mom, I cleaned up the entire garage floor and vacuumed and mopped it until it was spotless. I won't go into graphic detail about the sights and smells I had to endure in there, but I think I should win some kind of award for courage under fire. Needless to say, this made my mom very happy.  I'm done with all my AP tests for the rest of the year (since I decided not to take the Physics one tomorrow, good luck on that shit), but I'm not done with all the stresses in my life. As of this moment, I'm procrastinating on my score for my music composition final project due tomorrow, but it's actually coming along quite well. I basically used an old music box I had and extracted the melody from it, only to find out that it's Tchaikovsky's "Waltz of the Flowers" from the Nutcracker Suite. So upon said discovery, I decided to transpose and arrange the waltz in a shorter version with some minor alterations. I arranged it for a trio of violin, viola, and cello with a small consensus, too. Sooooooo...I hope it turns out OK. I still have to mush it all together into one big thingy-ma-bob, so I'll probably be up purty late tonight. Better get cracking.

      Oh man...Heather and I walked about 4 miles on the beach and had nice encounters with giant sandcrabs, sea whips, and "jellyfish".  We're planning a thing to celebrate the end of the school year. So far, we've figured that it will include the beach and guacamole. I have two APs tomorrow. This day was the calm before the storm. But at least I don't have to go to school tomorrow :) And now I'm off to study a little, and then go to the beach again with my mommy and my brother. Bye. Love, Insha  P.S. Happy Mothers' day. Remember to tell your mom you love her and give her a hug. Or I'll hunt you down and kill you.

      Today turned out to be pretty alright.  Art history was fine.  More presentations, more lectures, and then Mr. Eldred had his back to me when he came to talk, and Trupe was like cracking up at the faces I made at him.  Turns out we can do any art that we want, so long as it doesn't offend people.  Oh, great, when has art, well good art anyways, never offended somebody?  Anand, Steph and I have some definite brainstorming to do...  Went to US History for the second final, which I ended up doing better on.  Then I read Heather's author project for the rest of class, but I've still got many pages to go.  Nick and I went to O'Brien's for lunch, which was good, and then we went to class.  They didn't announce editors today, I guess they had to have another meeting first.  We'll see what happens Thursday, eh?  Afterward, Steph and I rushed to Jamba/car gas, then Tierrasanta for yet another session of Junior Journalists.  It was fun; the kids are really great...but I don't know if they're gonna do any of their homework.  There's this one girl, Carmen, a sixth grader, and she seems like she knows what she's doing.  She's got a really witty sense of humor and there's a definite passion there.  Steph and I pulled her aside afterward and told her that we recognized that she probably knew most of what we were teaching and that we were going to give her special assignments so she could have more fun.  That made her happy, and at least we'll have a few articles from her to have published in their self-titled "Firenerds" publication (haha, they liked the idea of Falconerds...go figure).  Came home and studied lightly for calc.  Steph and I talked about all the concepts on the phone, and I think that's most helpful.  I think I may just understand this calculus thing.  I'm so beaching during 6th.  Give me a call if you want to come with us!

      Today was mixed--woke up at 6:30 from a long night of tossing and turning for two hours in the heat before I could really fall asleep. I was so excited last night after that concert. It's sad to think that it was our last real concert with Mr. Kohn, but somehow it feels fitting and resolute that we played  Carmina Burana  in our final performance. This band really went out with a bang. I also feel strangely inspired after some of the feedback I received just from Matt and my parents. We really did our best, and this band has come such a long way, it's really amazing to think how crappy we used to sound.  Anyway, back to this morning. I woke up and drove to school, arriving on time at about 7:20 in room 410 to take the AP English Language test. Reviewed really quickly with Matt (who so conveniently happens to always be in the same testing rooms with me since our last names are very close together), and we sat for three grueling hours of 54 multiple choice questions on reading comprehension and three giant free-response essay questions with accompanying passages. Boy, was that stressful. I have complete apathy and lack of respect for the little shits that actually write these stupid passages about "propriety" and "truth" and "heroes" and "racism." Been there, done that, we've heard it all before, and we don't care to hear it again. The only free-response question I liked was the one where it gave us, the students, a little ambiguous leeway--we had the freedom to write about any issue in the whole wide world, so I picked environmental pollution from cars and America's tendencies to waste gas and pollute with giant, gas-guzzling vehicles. That essay flowed ten times more freely than the two others.  After we made it over that hurdle, Matt and I went to the beach with Brenna where we had a good time watching Matt frolick in the water, discussing our "issues," and sunbathing fully clothed like a bunch of losers who hate their bodies. I love being an insecure teenager, it's awesome.  So then we stopped by Board & Brew for a quick bite to eat (never been there before), and then back home. Hooray.   AP Tests Tally:  one  down,  two  to go.

      Hey guys!  So...pause...  Well this week was just a ton of fun.  Yeah.  I don't really remember a lot of it now that I think about it- oh, no, wait, yeah I do.  Tests, projects, quizzes, and more tests.  Yesterday my Cubism project was due, and I had my US History final.  Then there were editorship interviews...  Well that's done.  I made it home by 3 for the NTRB phone interview, and that one went pretty well I think.  Then I drove Jenny some advil and crashed, waking up bright and early at 6:30 to make my way to Escondido.  Well, MapQuest, you've fucked me over before.  So after deciding that staying on the I-5 wasn't the way to get to the 78-E, it directed me to San Marcos Blvd.  After about 20 minutes looking for that, I called home, and found that I was gonna have to get myself back on the I-5 and drive down most of the 78 before I got to Escondido High.  Well...I got there on time, but I was damn nervous.  Took the Writing test and got the hell out of there.  Now I'm home, thinking about how I might spend the rest of this weekend.  Parents are leaving Monday morning for Italy...oh, but alas, APs.  I love you all!

      Mrs. Chiu wrote all of us letters for the end of the year. She just so happened to remember one of my bitch moments:    Congrats - You're a Senior!   Dear Heather:  I don't know if you remember this, but I have a clear first memory of you in this class that involved signing up for authors. That morning I believe you and many others were here rather early, hoping to get a particular author. When I came and opened the door, there was a mad rush to find the sign-up sheets. I remember one individual holding a pen and ready to write his or her name next to an author and then distinctly hearing your voice say, "Excuse me, but I was here before you and that's my author." I admired that spunk and character you possessed and weren't afraid to show!  All throughout this year you've known what you've wanted and have applied yourself to getting it in a quiet and steadfast manner. Thank you for letting me be a part of your high school career. I wish you a wonderful summer!  Sincerely, Mrs. Chiu   Hahahahaha. That one gave me a good laugh.  Oh by the way-- school is out. :)

      Ah so much has taken place over the past few weeks, and I've barely had time to do anything with this blog. But now is my time to post a mini-update, I suppose.  Soooo...last week consisted of our final author presentations to wrap things up. What a relief! Yep, it's finally over, Insha--we can breathe now. We're also finishing things up in band. I think it's vastly appropriate that we're playing "Fate of the Gods" as our final piece together during graduation. It's very fitting and it brings back so many wonderful memories of four years ago (when the band was still young). I'm just going to cry and cry. And I also worked out my Junior Honor Court/Band coinciding dilemma at graduation. As it turns out, I can go through the regular procession with the JHC and then stand up with the seniors later in the show, walk down to the band, and play in our final performance. Ah, tear-jerker. Today was actually our last and final rehearsal. I'm gonna miss it so much, I can't even describe the sense of loss I feel. Oh well, things change.  Also, thanks to Matt (:-D), I got to judge in last week's TP Idol competition. It was fun, and for once I got to criticize/affect people for real. Fun! And I also got rid of any guilt surrounding the Margo issue, because I went up to her and congratulated her on her performance. Now the ball is in her court, and I have no guilt on me whatsoever. Kind of a relief, to tell the truth.  This week.....I'm just trying to finish, finish, finish. Just have to clear things up with Mr. Fleischman in Physics with all of my un-stamped engineering reports, take a test in English on  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest / Fences , and take my Math final. Then I will be DONE for good! And Wednesday, I get to skip school, go to Nordstrom's at 7:00am, and shop all day with my mom during the annual Half Yearly Sale! YAY! Clothes, clothes, clothes, my love. Damn, I'm so materialistic. But I enjoy every minute of it.  FRIDAY will be the big day. Saying final goodbyes to the band, graduation taking place, JHC in my purty dress (hehe), and our final performance with the band. Then I have to drive home, get changed really fast, hopefully drive to RB to pick up Amber, and get ready for our "Senior-Only" Dinner that Insha and I planned at Fish Market. We invited around 18-19 people, and it sounds like everyone is going, so that will be a nice finish to our year. Also on Saturday, we're having a Potluck at the beach with the same people, but I don't know if all of them will show. But that's due to be a fun get-together, too. Ahhhhh this week is gonna kick ass. See y'all tomorrow @ Physics Table.

      Hey you guys! It's nice to hear from you both,  especially  from you, "Hot Matt," or should I say, STRANGER! I'm glad you had such a great time at Northwestern. Of course, I'll have you share more of the details with me once you get back. ;)  And Insha, tonight we must hang out or something before you leave tomorrow! I'm gonna miss you so much. :( I know you'll play  beautifully  once again in Portugal, especially with your daily 2-hour practicing sessions. Don't worry, it'll ALL pay off eventually.  As for myself, I've been extremely bored in the doldrums of summer. August will be here on Sunday, and I've really yet to accomplish anything much. I started doing community service work at this place called Hannah's House in Balboa Park. Basically, it's a place where separated, two-house families can have supervised visitation for the parties who don't have custody of the child(ren), or so that an exchange can take place from one parent to another. They also have several themed rooms filled with books, toys, videos, arts and crafts, and animals to amuse the children. Essentially, it's a place to put the child at ease and prevent trauma, since most of the children come from a broken home or abuse situations. The past two days I've been vacuuming and cleaning there, bagging donated Starbucks pastries, and making phone calls to both parties as a reminder to exchange or visit their children. It's quite a hassle, actually. Sometimes I can't get ahold of the parent, or they start giving me an attitude about the price or what the other parent is up to. Today I had to call up parents and inform them that a Gay Pride Parade is taking place tomorrow on the same street and that they can't park there. Do you know how many people scoffed at that? People have no respect, I swear.  Other than that, not much else is going on. I should be doing my summer homework, but I've hardly even cracked open the books. I haven't socialized with anyone in a really, really long time. There's just no one around anymore. Now I'm almost looking forward to the beginning of school....bah.

      So, my friends, I'm leaving for Portugal early tomorrow morning. My mom and I will spend two weeks in Viana do Castelo, a port town in southern Portugal, for the music festival.  On the way back, we spend 3 nights in Paris. I think we're returning on the 18th of August.  I'll bring my cellphone, but I don't think my service is global. Leave me messages, though! :)  For your amusement: http://www.angryalien.com/ (Famous movies re-enacted in 30 seconds by bunnies.)  Erm, I think that's all I have to say. I'll try to post at an Internet cafe. Till that time, bye and I love you.

      Hey guys!   Well, it's my last day at Northwestern.&nbsp; I'm sitting here at 9:00 AM, one of the only people awake, but I wanted to get this all down.&nbsp; It's tradition to stay up all night and go out to the beach for the sunrise, after which most people went to sleep.   Some friends and I decided we'd help ourselves out with staying up.&nbsp; The chill guy here who smoked me out (his name is Matt too, or "Haz-Matt" [hazardous materials] as he is called here)&nbsp;is friends with this girl in the program (as am I, but he's better friends with her) who it turns out is on Aderoll for ADD.&nbsp; She was kind enough to hook us up, and it was a pretty amazing evening.&nbsp; We first stopped at Starbucks around 10 last night to get some warm-up caffeine, then we moved to Kafein, the local coffee shop, for the "spiked, ass-kicking caffeine" stuff.&nbsp; We got back to the dorms by 11:30 and took the Aderoll, then we signed t-shirts and notebooks for an hour or so.&nbsp; I signed on girls' boobs (well, the shirt covering them, but they were wearing them as I signed); twas much fun.&nbsp; Haha, I signed this one republican girl's right breast with "Megan- I'm starting over here because you're a republican."&nbsp; Then I drew an arrow to her left breast and finished "I'm not.&nbsp; Much love, 'Hot-Matt' (my nickname)."   I danced around like crazy for a little while, and got this great southern girl named Ashley Allen to dance with me on a table in the Great Room.&nbsp; Everyone kept asking how I had so much energy...   We moved outside to the beach around 3.&nbsp; A few of us stripped to our boxers or underwear and bras and ran into the freezing Lake Michigan water.&nbsp; We messed around for a while, and it felt great.&nbsp; We didn't bring towels, so we had to stand around on the&nbsp;beach cold and soaking wet.&nbsp; My boxers fell a bit and some people saw my ass, so I kind of started showing it off (this sounds absolutely  wonderful  in retrospect...must've been the speed) and got compliments and squeezes.&nbsp; After a bit, most of the chill kids had moved outside, and we started singing Disney songs, 80s-pop-songs, and musicals.&nbsp; It was really, really fantastic standing there in my boxers and singing Mulan's "Make a Man."   After I was pretty dry, I put my clothes back on and moved inside.&nbsp; We hung around the Great Room for a bit, then I found the same Aderoll friends again (Haz-Matt, Heather [great name], and Liz) and we planned our pot-smoking endeavors.&nbsp; We agreed to meet at 4:45 AM, and I went and hung out with some OMs and Kirsten told me about her hooking up with Elia (an instructor).&nbsp; Great details, much fun.&nbsp; I left to go smoke, but by then it was raining, and most of us waited in the suite on my floor until the sun started to rise.&nbsp; We reasoned we were too exhausted to smoke (only Haz-Matt and I were on the Aderoll).   We made our way outside and the weather was rainy (as it still is) for the first time in a few days.&nbsp; We couldn't actually see the sun rise, and I was feeling a bit more inhibited than I had felt several hours ago, so there wasn't anymore swimming.&nbsp; We moved back inside at 6:00 AM to see off Schmidy (David Schmitt), an endearing individual who is unlike anybody I've ever met.&nbsp; We reluctantly admitted that Cherubs was over, now that Schmidy had left.&nbsp; Most people trudged up to their rooms to sleep.&nbsp; My roomate slept and I packed while watching "Saved By the Bell" (god bless early morning WB).&nbsp; I went down to the Great Room to get my sandals and found that some friends were going to breakfast at Clarke's, this amazing cafe nearby, so at 7:00 AM we left.   I had lots more coffee and some strawberries and waffles.&nbsp; I've got about 60 mg of Aderoll in my system, and I've still got a 15 mg pill left for when this day gets a bit harder.&nbsp; Right now, I feel really great.&nbsp; We had deep conversations at breakfast (at least I thought so) but my friends retreated to do their own packing.&nbsp; So now I'm sitting here watching Dawson's Creek reruns on the WB.&nbsp; All packed, minus my trusty laptop.&nbsp; It's so sad.   This was an amazing experience.&nbsp; Yesterday we got this detailed booklet about the history of this program, including pictures of 1930s Cherubs.&nbsp; The history of this place and prestige of the alumni continues to amaze me.&nbsp; I am constantly humbled by those around me, and equally exhilarated by their passion for journalism.&nbsp; It's surreal to look around here, where I've spent the last five weeks, and say goodbye to it all.&nbsp; It's a gloomy day, and appropriately so.   I'll be doing college visits with my dad for the next week.&nbsp; I'll probably check my e-mail and have more time to call, so perhaps we can exchange some words in the coming week.&nbsp; I miss you guys so much, and when I'm ultimately done with my summer adventures, I look forward to returning to a place I call home.   Much love, "Hot-Matt."

      Funny how stuff seems to happen to us at the same time, hmm Heather?  I'm absolutely exhausted. I was at the music school at rehearsal and lessons from 8 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon, and then had a recital at 5:30.  I made one mistake on the first piece I played. That is, one wrong note, which I corrected right away. I talked to my mom after the recital:  Me: Mom, what did you think?  Mom: You messed up.  Me: Yeah, but it was only one note and it was probably because I was tired.  Mom: You shouldn't mess up.  Me: ...  Mom: I'm going home, you drive with Nikita.  I didn't think too much of this, because this is usually what happens after performances...if she says anything, it's "you messed up". I don't really mind it though, because my teacher gives me the real feedback, and I was happier than usual with how I performed.  When I got home with my brother, I looked around the house for my mom, and found her in a room downstairs lying down. When I asked what was wrong, she said "I'm very depressed because you don't practice enough and you go up there and make a fool out of&nbsp;yourself."  I don't know if I should have, but I just left the room because I didn't want to argue with her. I went to my room and slept for a few hours and I woke up around 10...my mom had gone out by herself. She just got back about 40 minutes ago. I tried to talk to her but I don't think it's any use. I told her that I was sorry that I messed up, but she didn't reply...about 5 minutes later she told me to go away, so here I am.   Sometimes I wish that she would be proud of me for things. I'm know that I'm not. I always feel that I need someone else to be happy with me no matter what I do. Somehow I'm not yet capable of being happy with my actions or accomplishments (or lack thereof).  I honestly wouldn't stress about the stupid recital if she hadn't done that. I don't know. It's too late to call anyone and I don't know what I'd say anyway. I don't think I can sleep. I might go to the beach in a few hours if I can't sleep. I need cleansing bad.  I'd rather be angry than whatever I am right now. At least anger can be directed at someone. I don't know what this mess is and I don't know how to deal with it right now.  i need a hug...

      I am literally so sick and tired of my parents. These past few days have been an absolute NIGHTMARE dealing with their bullshit. My parents are constantly sheltering me. I'm almost never allowed to go out and do anything, especially at night. They think it's normal for a teenager to spend their evenings at home with the family. I get so bored of it and being cooped up in this damned house all the time. Go figure I sneak out just about every night. So yesterday, I asked my mom if I could spend the night at a friend's house.  "No."  "Why not?"  "I don't like sleepovers. And I don't get a good impression from ______." (Don't want to mention names)  I go through this bullshit EVERYTIME I ask to do something. And it's almost NEVER a yes.  So yesterday I just blew up at her and started screaming. Apparently, she doesn't think my car should be used for driving to hang out with friends. Its purpose is for "driving to work, school, or a community service activity." Bullfuckingshit. That's not why teenagers own cars. If that's what it was solely meant for, then fuck the car, I don't want it. Then she goes on to condemn all of my friends, telling me that she has the right to CHOOSE who I hang out with. And she thinks that I will develop a social life through a job and volunteer work. Um, NO. My curfew is at fucking 10:30pm, and I don't even get to EXERCISE the fucking thing because I'm never allowed out! I'm going to have a brain aneurism if I have to spend one more fucking day in the house, do one more chore for her, waste more of my gas on favors for her, or hear a word about community service or getting a fucking job. So today we fought again at the dinner table, and this time, she took my car keys away and threw my clothes and belongings out the window. That was our latest encounter. I nearly resorted to leaving the house for three days, and I would have if my rides didn't turn me down. Amber tried to drive her mom's car here, but she got lost. And Aaron was going to have me stay in LA with him for three days, but his girlfriend is opposed to the idea, and his mom didn't want him driving down here at night. So much for the vacation-from-the-parents idea. Oh fucking well. I'll just have to face the music  again  tomorrow. GRRRRR!!

      Aw my dearest Matt, we will always support you, no matter how stoned you are and whatever you do during the time that you're stoned. My favorite quote from your post: "I saw Dodgeball. I almost cried a lot." Now, how  exactly  do you "almost" cry a lot? Explain please? You silly boy.  I am currently looking at my TV screen, and there is a nude man with whipped cream on his two pecs and over his crotch, with two cherries on each nipple. Fascinating.  Anyway, I had a really good day today for a change. Lately I've been bundled up at home because I had my wisdom teeth extracted last Tuesday. The nitrous oxide rocked, the shots sucked, the surgery felt like it only lasted a minute, the feeling when I woke up sucked, I was loopy for quite some time after, the pain was unbearable, the starvation from being limited to only soft foods completely sucked, the vicadin was a miracle, and the swelling made me look like a chipmunk that was punched in the face. All in all, it was a bitch, but I'm almost fully recovered.  Back to today.... So today Insha and I drove out to Encinitas to a consignment shop to see if we could sell a few old items from our closets. I made $21, she made $15. Not bad for crappy clothes we don't wear anymore. Then we drove to Solana Beach and looked around in some hippie shops. Later drove to Golden Spoon, had some delicious ice cream, dropped by Longs, picked up some Propel and ramen. Good times, good times.  I'm gonna go vegetate some more in front of the TV now. More updates later.

      I like the convenience of our blog. There's no pressure to post anything you don't want to, and no obligation to write on some regular schedule. That's such a good quality in a blog.  So, yes, boys and girls, I'm stoned at Northwestern. Sitting here in my room, typing away on my laptop as though I don't write enough at this camp. I suddenly had the desire to come online and tell you all about it. You can't really tell people here about when you're stoned, cause you might just get kicked out. That makes it a little lonely.  I saw Dodgeball. I almost cried a lot. Yay for the underdogs.&nbsp; And it actually was funny.  I also finished that story today. It was okay. I don't know- I think I'm gonna fry Futures when I get home. I don't know what to do about the Falconer. There's some romantic notion of becoming a writer for the next year and falling into the stories. I thought I'd try doing that junior year, but there just wasn't time, or I just decided not to. I don't know how much time I'm gonna have next year, I've just stopped thinking of any work that could be associated with school. Shitfuck, I have to fill 2 sketchbooks, and I've definitely not started that. I want to have fun next year.  Next year is gonna be a self-improvement year. I know everybody else probably feels exactly the same way, but I am so over school. I mean, I love the kids and the teachers and the clubs and all of it, but all the other busy bullshit really doesn't matter anymore. Senioritis is just putting everything into perspective.  College apps are gonna be more work than I thought, I think. That makes Falconer, Litmag, Winter's Tale, CityBeat, Coast News, the Reader, Junior Journalists, the Janice Pai Foundation and classes seem a little trivial. It would be a bad time to get overloaded. But I honestly think that there will be less distractions this year. It was a lot of fun to hang out with Nick, but without him, I'll be back in school a lot more and yeah. I also wanted to go to the gym a lot. I hope there's time.  So yes, writing camp. Journalism camp. The time here goes by so strangely. Some days are so fast, and some days are so slow. It's a lot of fun most of the time. I don't know how to not get angry when friends of mine hook up with guys that they are so much better than.&nbsp; They slave over them and obsess about them, and I just think "you guys are so much better than this crap."  Oh! I thought about this earlier... There's this sad energy that hangs around married couples who've just had a baby. The couple looks odd together all of a sudden. They're sad because they realize that they are settling. They can't go marry that supermodel and be a money-making machine. They are anchored into that life that they didn't ever think they wanted. When you have a baby, you're settling. Wherever you are, whatever you're doing- it's suddenly who you are. And for a lot of people, that seems sad.  There were better stoner thoughts earlier today- I'm trying to think of the good ones. There was a really good one about this smoothie worker giving me the wrong smoothie from what I ordered because she knew I was stoned. But of course I couldn't argue it with her, because I'm not capable of any serious argument. And she can look at me and tell me indirectly that she is pissed off with me for coming to her smoothie shop stoned, and laugh because I'm drinking a smoothie I didn't order but paid for. Maybe she just got the order wrong, but I don't think so.  And I remember talking to Nick about how iPods dictated social class. The 15GB, the 20 GB, and the 40 GB. It so reflects social status.  Don't make me feel dumb for typing all this up. I think it was therapeutic. We don't usually put anything deep onto this... and if there's a bad reaction, I guess I'll never do it again. Thank you for your time.

      Hey all.   This is my form of procrastination. We have to come up with a trend story and research and interview for it all week. It'll be fun, but I don't have a solid idea yet.   Northwestern is so amazing. I'm having a terrific time and I'm learning a ton about journalism. It's so cool. Tomorrow we get to go to Newsweek and the Art Institue of Chicago! I'm so excited. Haha, and today we have our ONLY lecture on design... I'm turning into a...a... writer.   Oh, and I got my first (hopefully of many) articles published in the Daily Northwestern. It's about a giant penis (figures, right?). Check it out here: http://www.dailynorthwestern.com/vnews/ display.v/ART/2004/07/08/40ecdd057636e.   Good for you Insha, getting started on those apps! A lot of people here talk about college, so, yeah, that's on my mind too. And Heather, going out there and doing some visits- that's supachill. Hope you are feeling better. Wow you guys... this year is gonna be amazing.   E-mail me if you want, mfranks@san.rr.com.   I'm gonna go fold my laundry (a la more procrastination). Miss you all!

      The "F" Word  When is "fuck" acceptable?   There are only ten times in history where the "F" word has been considered acceptable for use.  They are as follows:  "Scattered fucking showers, my arse!" - Noah, 4314 BC  "How the fuck did you work that out?" - Pythagoras 126 BC  "You want what on the fucking ceiling?" - Michelangelo, 1566  "Where did all those fucking Indians come from?" - Custer, 1877  "What the fuck do you mean we are sinking?" - Capt E.J Smith of RMS Titanic, 1912  "It does fucking look like her!" - Picasso, 1926  "Any fucking idiot could understand that." - Einstein, 1938  "What the fuck was that?" - Mayor of Hiroshima, 1945  "Aw c'mon. Who the fuck is going to find out?" - Bill Clinton  "Geez, I didn't think they'd get this fucking mad." - Saddam Hussein   Wow, you guys, I'm so bored right now. And bummed because it's really ugly outside and I don't feel like venturing anywhere. It's also colder than it should be. I'm also beginning to be deeply worried about apps. I don't know how I'm going to get through the stress of this year, considering how well (HA, I laugh) I handled it last year.    Things I have learned since I started being worried about college:  ~ the Common Application scares the bajeezus out of me ~ the SAT can kiss my ass ~ the PLAN and PSAT are retarded ~ getting letters from colleges is more fun than it should be ~ SAT prep is an utter waste of time ~ the UCs are slightly evil ~ there are way too many good colleges on the East coast ~ there always seems to be another good school that I've never heard of ~ everything is way too expensive ~ my #1 criteria for a college is that it won't be like a high school ~ there is no such thing as a perfect match ~ narrowing my "Apply To" list down to 21 is a major accomplishment ~ by the time I go to college I'll probably already be over it ~ if I go to a prep school I'll go insane ~ my mom doesn't want me to go to New York, but LA is ok... ~ all in all, I don't care about undergrad ~ I hope nobody I know goes to my school. ^I mean no offense whatsoever by this last one. It would be nice, you know, to go to a new school and be the campus whore or something else interesting, with brand new people to make bad impressions on. :)  On a lighter note, I found out some tasty information about my Portugal trip: we'll be rooming with around 80 musicians from Europe. Which means, hopefully, a good amount of hot Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and French guys to ogle. Should be fun.  I'm off. I hope both of you are having a great time.   Love, Insha   *edit* : My mom told me today, "I think you need to get away from here. Spread your wings and all that." Yay for not being confined to the West coast! And not being forbidden from applying to schools in New York! I have the coolest mom on the face of the earth.

      I'm sorry for not posting in such a long time. The summer has made me ultimately lazy. It's actually been quite a crazy summer although we're only into the beginning of July. I'll make a list of some of my "activities" as I remember them:  -15th Street/Powerhouse Park -surfing -tanning -Fish Market -Red Robin -party -alcohol -ganja -hookah -cigarettes -La Jolla Shores -bonfire -political debate -boys :D -RB -In'N'Out -WT crack lady & ketchup -Epicentre show (whilst under the influence) -honking at random people -chorizo -fireworks -Encinitas window shopping at hippie shops w/Insha -SNEAKING OUT (a trillion times) -late night driving -random people -hot boxing car in garage -secrets, secrets -three college guys: shrimpy "baby," the hot one, and the pushover -sleepovers -measly attempt at surfing w/Chris -"Fahrenheit 9/11" -phonecalls from a drunken bitch -waking up and having no clue where I am -embarrassing pictures -random bug bites -fun fun fun  And this is only the beginning. Tomorrow I'm leaving on a trip with my family for Northern California. We're driving up to Napa Valley and visiting a bunch of colleges: UC Davis, UC Berkeley, UCLA, etc. Then we're just gonna poke around there I suppose. When I get back in a week, I'm having my wisdom teeth pulled on July 14th (boohoo). Then I'm probably gonna get back on track again with my "activities." :)  Welps, I miss all of you. Insha, Matt, Azaam, Leela...I hope all of you are having a great summer. Keep in touch! :)  Love always!!

      For the past 3 weeks, I've been completely alone and by myself. I haven't seen a damn soul, save for my parents and brothers. It's literally so unbearable. I miss all of my friends and school so bad, I can't describe it. I hardly get out anymore--just to do the community service and maybe drop my brother off somewhere. Here's a picture of my social life:     Behold, the great abyss of my social life. Boohoo. Someone help me create/improve/develop one? PLEASE?!
