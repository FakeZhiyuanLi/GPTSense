      Actor, Phoenix Walker can't seem to get enough of working with up-and-coming playwright, Christopher Carlos. Walker has just signed on to head the cast of Carlos' much-anticipated trilogy, "American Mythology." This will be Carlos' Gotham debut and he is looking for a strong cast to bring his work to life. Carlos reports, "The play, basically, confronts the two schools of thought 'If it ain't broke don't fix it' and 'A change will do you good.' We see a group of people who live in this world similar to ours in structure but without all of our bullshit. But eventually the things that make our world horrible infiltrate their world. It's a sick idea."  Carlos confirms that the play in itself is not about America, but more about the idea of America. "I like the idea of what America is supposed to stand for. And maybe once upon a time it did. But how did we get here? That's what I ask in the play. And how are we going to go back? If we go back at all. Do we need to go backwards to move forward?" Sounds like pretty heavy stuff. But what we really want to know is when we should plan on having these questions answered? According to Carlos, "Sometime in the beginning of the year. Alot of business things need to be settled first and a strong cast needs to be gathered. But, if not winter 2005 definitely spring. "

      We finally got a chance to sit down with Phoenix Walker and get to know the man behind the characters. We meet at the ultra-hip "Tonic." He straddles in a few minutes after me. He wears a cowboy hat, white tee, ripped jeans and cowboy boots. Definitely not what I was expecting.   BC : What's with the outfit?  PW : I like to constantly look different. Today I felt like a cowboy. I almost went with the hip-hop chic look but I decided to do this instead. Do you like it?  BC : It's great. What's the "hip-hop chic look?"  PW : Well, it's just wearing hip-hop clothing but matching it with something else kind of expensive. It's what P. Diddy does.  BC : So, you're into versatility, I see.  PW : I crave versatility. In everything. Movies, TV, music, people, sex [laughs]... No, seriously, that's one of the main reasons I'm an actor. I mean, we have our different characters in life. Example - who I am when I'm out with the fellas is definitely not who I am when I'm with my mom. But, even that doesn't compare to acting. I mean, one day I can play a basketball player and the next a drag queen. Totally different and I love that.  BC : Now, before we get too far into acting. I have some personal questions to ask you.  PW : Personal? Like if I'm wearing underwear or not?  BC : Not that personal.  PW : I'm not, by the way.  BC : [laughs]  PW : Go ahead. You can ask me your  personal  questions.  BC : OK... How old are you?  PW : 20. Is that it?  BC : No. Where are you from?  PW : Well, see, that's tricky because I've lived in so many different places. But, if I had to go with one place it would definitely be New York.  BC : Over California? You seem pretty glamorous to me.  PW : I love California and the glamorous aspects of it, but I'm, I like to believe, more real than glamour. And New York is pretty real for me.  BC : OK. Now the question most of your female fan base wants to know - Do you have a girlfriend?  PW : Nope. Not at all. But, I'm definitely looking. I just broke up with my high school girlfriend not too long ago.  BC : What happened?  PW : Well, lots of things happened. But, basically, what it boils down to is that, as human-beings, we all change. Our tastes change. Our perspective changes. But, fortunately, we're learning to be friends.  BC : That's good. Now, that we've answered those questions, let's move on to your acting. How long have you been doing it?  PW : Unofficially, I've always been acting. Officially, since I was 13.  BC : So, that's... 7 years? That's it.?  PW : Yeah. But, I've done quite a bit in those 7 years.  BC : Like what?  PW : Actually, I, being the nerd that I am, recently did a tally of how many roles I've performed. And it was like close to 70 roles with more than half being lead roles. And I'm sure there's stuff that I missed too. So, that's about 10 roles a year, which is pretty remarkable to me.  BC : How were you able to do so many roles?  PW : When I started acting, my goal was to just get as much experience as possible. I knew that I learned through doing and practicing, not by reading a book or anything like that. So, I got on my feet every chance I could get. And then after that my whole focus was doing the roles that would widen my range as an actor - things that scared the shit out of me.  BC : Which brings me to a recent quote that Christopher Carlos [playwright] said about you. "He is the ultimate risk-taker. He doesn't shy away from anything. I think he enjoys life more than the rest of us." How true is this statement?  PW : Well, I don't know. I don't look at things as being risky or not. And I don't think that attract those things either. I just more or less try to elminate fear from my life. Really question why I'm afraid to do whatever. If the answer is nonsense I do it. If it makes sense then I don't. It's a simple way to live, but it really helps me.  BC : Did you have to question yourself before taking the lead in Carlos' trilogy, "American Mythology?"  PW : Actually, no, but I probably should have. [laughs] To me, taking this role was sort of a no-brainer. I know Chris' work really well. He has the most amazing characters and the situations and dialogue are always good too. So, actually, the circumstances chose me instead of the other way around.  BC : But, is the thought of doing a trilogy ever scary?  PW : Well, the thought of having to build this character between three different plays is a bit. But, it's also an actor's dream. One of the ultimate challenges - along with playing the opposite sex. Mythology is essentially a 9 hour play. So, each play is epic in itself. And I have to figure out the my character's path for the whole thing and then I have to break it down into the different sections. In reality, it would be much easier if we did the whole thing as one piece.  BC : That would be insane.  PW : It would be, but I have a feeling Chris is gonna ask for that. Not the initial production, of course, but probably during the run of the last play.  BC : And what will you say?  PW : I'll probably say "yes."  BC : Why?  PW : Because it's not really something to be afraid of.  [to be continued...]

      Actor, Phoenix Walker has confirmed that after a 2002 production of "Angels In America," he fell in love with disco music.  "I'm not just talking the Bee-Gees, Donna Summer and Abba.  I'm talking about that underground stuff.  The really dirty music that has the basslines that sound like they were meant for... you know?"  Is that why you like them Phoenix?
