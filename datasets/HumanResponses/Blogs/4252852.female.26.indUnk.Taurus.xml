						   is finding out you don't have to work - so you go home and spend the day doing whatever you want to!!!!  I came home and cleaned - turned on Holly Cole Trio and cleaned (needed) - and then I submitted FOUR manuscripts to journals. That made me feel very good.   I lit incense, vaccumed, ....then bought ice cream after I mailed off the submissions...ate to much ice cream...but oh well.   I got a rejection letter from another journal in the mail today, but no matter. I will keep going!  I want to take this moment to thank Leonie from the MMB who seems to be a big fan of my blog - and I'm so thankful for the encouraging and loving words you leave for me in the comments section. Thank you!  Tomorrow starts orientation.   Oh, I should mention something curious: I've been having very good dreams lately. Yesterday I woke up from a dream where my book got published - and then I got the good news that my poem was accepted!  And last night, I dreamt I sang in "Les Miserables" which is a recurring situation in dreams for me. I rarely to never actually sucessfully sing in the dream. But last night, I did.   Things may be looking up, just as I'm moving forward.    Fin.

						   Woooooohoooooooooooo  It is SUCH a high to find out you're going to get published. I feel a bit foolish because I just sent a huge mass email out to all my friends telling them. It wasn't so much bragging, but wanting to share my good news. There's a difference.   The Southern Ocean Review accepted a poem of mine and it will appear in the October issue.   I am now an internationally published poet! The SOR is in New Zealand.   I was published in Canada - a personal essay - in 1996...or was it 1997?  Going to go enjoy my emotional riches...

						   Don't you HATE it when you have things you want to do - like write and create and live - and instead you have to go GROCERY SHOPPING???  *sigh*  But Alex and I are up in loft. Alex is going through old boxes of memories because I'm creating a shadow box of pictures of us when we were little along with little items from that period. And I've been bugging him to look for stuff for a few weeks. He's making duck calls with a ... a... duck caller... and my cat is looking at him wide-eyed.   I feel lucky that Alex is willing to go through his history (which is hard sometimes) to make my creative and nostalgic side happy.   He made a good point: We are at different points, he is further away from his childhood than I am. And that makes our outlook on that childhood different. That makes sense...   I feel irritable and anxious today. My idea for today was for us to go sit by the lake and read. I was going to start "The Courage to Heal"...the bible for abuse survivors...but now I just feel...irritable and anxious.   I had another emotional memory episode last night. I feel so helpless, like I don't have any tools to help me. I don't see my new therapist until August 31st... and every day just seems like another day where that word is pushed further and harder into my face: ABUSE.  NEGLECT. PAIN. SEX. SHAME.  I start class orientation next week. The summer officially ends tomorrow for me. It was an interesting summer, though I didn't do as much writing as I would have liked. But I still want to go back and hide in the summer.   Change always makes me want to hide.  Fin.

						   Tonight, Alex showed me the movie "The Pink Panther" - boy, was it funny! I rarely laugh OUT LOUD at a movie, but when those men in the zebra costume were running down that street past the man, I just lost it.  To complete my night, I saw that my own Anne left a comment on my blog. Anne, my twilight sister, my heavenly savior from high school! Below is a picture of the two of us from 1996. Night of Girl's Choice dance. How beautiful we were! I'm sure we outshine ourselves now. I do miss her terribly.  She was a wonder to me in my life. My senior year, full of heartache in so many different forms, she came along literally like a breath of fresh air (she, the ex-girlfriend of my current but soon-to-be ex-boyfriend back then) and changed my very existance with her Womyn N-R-G tea, white wooded house, stories of her Umma, introducing me to Garrison Keillor, Holly Cole Trio, "The Heidi Chronicles," and best of all: Tolkien's elvin runes.   Our letters that we wrote back and forth that year constitutes a whole book, one I've always wanted to complete, but time got in the way. But one day... one day.  Tonight, I salute you, Annie, wherever you are. You and Linda were the first bit of real, honest-to-goodness MAGIC to come into my life - and all in the same year. How about that!  I love you dearly and miss you so...    Fin

						   Things are accelerating. I'm thinking more and more about my class - the English 100 I have to teach. I'm getting more and more anxious with orientation coming up. My mind is becoming upset because I don't know what to expect. Last night I needed to feel in control of SOMETHING so I went out to Walgreens at 9 in the evening and bought a day planner. I needed to write important dates down. That, to me, felt like progress. Control. While I was there, of course, being a school supply junkee, I bought a new 5 subject notebook, tabs to index pages and then - to make my inner child happy - a fun Care Bear pen. I was especially pleased with that purchase. So last night I dated my day planner and marked down important dates thus far. It was hard for me to fall asleep. Yesterday afternoon I went to the fabric store and let my psyche run wild and I walked up and down fabric aisles, touching the fabrics and seeing if one called out to be my "Flashback Blanket".... or a sort of comforting thing I can wrap around myself when I feel scared or "little" or am having an emotional flashback. I thought about getting Strawberry Shortcake fabric, but then I thought, I shouldn't go back to childhood, the purpose of wrapping that fabric around me is to make me feel safe as a 26 year old, as an adult. So I found a wonderful fabric with roses on it. It's so soft, too. I love it.  I went into work today and it turned out they didn't need me. So I left. My intention was to walk to the garage and get my car and drive home, but oh, State Street is so full of great shops!!! I went into a clothing store and decided I deserved a new shirt for school, so I found a pretty floral one. Then I went into Community Pharmacy and found that Bach's Stress Remedy that I heard people talking about on the SARK board and bought that along with some good tea that Wonderful Boyfriend and I like. Then I just HAD to walk into the Soap Opera, our neighborhood bath and body store. It's yummy! I bought a bar of soap..hhmm....and some, dare I say, massage oil for some relaxing and/or fun times at home. Hehehe.  And then - oh - across the street was a new age shop called Shakti. I normally don't go in, but I just felt pulled...  I went inside, forced myself not to get new incense, although I did get a little cone incense holder since I needed one. Then I found a card that had a beautiful, surreal picture of a woman dreaming.... I thought it was appropriate, what with my nightmares. So I bought it for myself. i don't know if I'll put it in my journal, write a poem about it, or put it in my scrapbook or hang it up or what. Then I saw bumper stickers... and I liked some of them! I bought three:  SUPPORT TEACHERS (something like that)  I LOVE THEREFORE I AM  and  oooh i forget - something about experience joy.  I was pleased. I darted out there as soon as I could and forced myself on to the garage. I put the stickers on my car and got outta there.  So here I am at home, listening to the Best Of Elvis CD that Wonderful Boyfriend made for me. I'm going to do some online researching for my class.  I'd also like to do today - sit outside on our little deck and read my inner child workbook and start some of the exercises, or sit outside and write in my journal (a lot to catch up on)... so many things I could do! I *should* practice my fiddle. Haven't done that in a while.  Fin.

						   If someone comes to you and asks you how to do something - even if it is a simple task - please do not make them feel silly for asking, embarrassed for not knowing, incompetent. The world is full of people not knowing and it is other peoples' jobs to help them along the way.  Fin.

						   Today was a marvelous day. I knew it would be. I read a post a young woman posted on a site about her survivorship of some pretty horrific abuse and I felt compelled to write her an email. I found out she lived near me and we planned a get-together. And today we got together.  It was amazing. Proof that kindreds exist. I walked into her apartment as if I had walked in there twenty times before. I didn't feel one ounce of anxiety. We talked and talked and listened to Tori Amos and I marveled as she attended to her two young children - one four months old, the other 3 years old.  What a completely and utterly healing day.  I've  known that I've needed to be around children lately. I visit my best friend Lauren and the five year old boy she cares for in the park now and then. He has Cerebral Palsy (I think that's what he has) and is deaf, but he is such a little wonder. Lauren is so good with him; it's inspiring to watch her with him. He has the biggest brown eyes and when he smiles his whole face lights up. He's touched me deeply.  My new friend's children touched me deeply, too. The oldest was a little shy when I arrived, but soon he was calling me by my first name and telling me about his computer game. Their family dog came over to me - the most intuitive dog I have ever known. The little baby was a jewel, big eyes, smiling. I was amazed at how my new friend handled all of this. And to my standards, she is still so young (well, a year younger than me).  But there we sat, she rocking the baby and feeding him, us talking about our pasts, good books, favorites of all kind. I drank delicious tea and she gave me a Tibetan prayer flag to take home.  I feel the word "ally" coming forth in my head. Kindred and friend, too, but ally. I wonder why that word, specifically.  I know I'm in for a bumpy ride for a while. With the new school semester starting, and me teaching this god forsaken class that stresses me out so much, going off Risperdal (one of my many meds), starting with a new therapist, and knowing I have to start dealing with abuse stuff because the abuse stuff is dealing with me! And not well right now.  It's good to have allies.  I'm thankful for friends who you just know ... you knew. You know?  I feel a little lonely tonight. I wish I had time to go out to a fabric store and buy a "trigger blanket," as was suggested in the comments field. Having a piece of material that I buy that calls out to me when I'm having a flashback seems soothing to me.  I will combat this loneliness by going downstairs and putting the prayer flag up in my little alcove, my meditation space, me "me place" and then spend some time with Wonderful Boyfriend.  I salute you, Sarah. And all my other kindreds I have in my life: Lauren, Barb, Tammy.  Fin.

						      I want a baby when I look at this picture!!! Well, I want a baby anyway, but I know it won't be for another year or two or three. Wonderful Boyfriend is being patient as can be with me. We are at different places in our lives due to an age difference...but we work together lovingly on it and we get through.  I can seriously envision us having a child, though. A little girl. We've already named her. Her first name would be Evelyn and we'd call her Evie.  When I was sixteen years old and very deeply depressed, I needed to conjure up something/someone to live for. I literally needed a reason to get up every morning. I liked a certain painter at that time...I can't spell his name, it's French... but he painted this picture of a girl holding apples... I'll post the picture at a later time... and so that picture called out to me. I named her "Caryn Eve" and she became my guardian angel, my hope of a one-day daughter to live for, so that I may share my love.  It worked. 10 years later I am still alive and really living every second of it. I can tell that 16 year old, "shh, you don't need a reason anymore... we just KNOW that it's worth living..."  I promised myself I wouldn't name my daughter Caryn Eve - too much pressure, you know? But I find it ironic and fortuitious that Wonderful Boyfriend and I have chosen a name with "Eve" in it... totally unintentionally, too.  Fin.

						   I admit it. I've gotten obsessed with this whole blog idea. An old friend of mine, Joseph, emailed me and told me I could see recent pictures of him online if I registered onto  urlLink www.myspace.com . Well... I did. And I ended up making up a whole profile for myself. I'm also on Friendster. I also have a webspace at PlanetSark (for fans of the author SARK). And now Wonderful Boyfriend and I have the tools to create a web page for ourselves.  Besides all that, I've been keeping a journal since I was ten years old. I am now on book number 70. Seventy! I fear, though, with all my online writing, I will neglect my actual journal. I don't want to do that.  But is this all too much? Am I overexposed on the internet? Is this a danger?  And, sure, I'm at work now and I have time to empty my brain out on the internet, but school is approaching on its mega-skateboard fast, ready to run me down. I won't have as much free time.  I am also taking on the huge task of taking care of myself.  Why, wouldn't that be a natural thing to do, you ask? Ah ha! You would think so, wouldn't you.  You see, I know that I am going through a period of transition, a period of change and healing. To heal, though, I have to get through some pretty ugly and uncomfortable feelings. I've bought all the books I could find that were about sexual abuse, emotional abuse, being afraid of anger, reclaiming your inner child and then I bought a simple book about an author's tale of living, secluded, in the Sangre de Cristo mountains. Just to relax my brain.  I am doing all of this because my life is becoming not live-able. I don't mean suicide, I just mean that I am getting very little sleep due to my nightmares. I wake poor Wonderful Boyfriend up who has to calm and soothe me. So it's effecting his sleep, too. I'm experiencing PTSD stuff more often. All this tells me I am ready to do some work.  I don't resume work with my new therapist until August 31st. I have to find a way to function in the meantime. And I can. I just have to be strong and know I am the best caretaker of ME.  I have recently met, online, a wildly succulent and strong woman who pulled me toward her with her electric energy and we are meeting tomorrow for the first time to chat and have a grand old time. I am so very excited.   Ways I will take care of myself:  Continue to spend time with my friends Keep writing (that will never change) Keep reading Meditate Therapy Pet my furbaby, Callie... when she is on my chest, purring, I feel so safe Allow Wonderful Boyfriend to love me, really allow that love to effect me Hold onto my faith.

						   I am so tired. I am so disturbed. I have to teach this class - an argumentative class and I must choose the topic. I've chosen the topic of Rights of Sexual Offenders - should we know they're living in our neighborhoods or not? Do these past offenders get a second chance at a regular life? I've been reading and bookmarking online articles and websites for the past two and a half hours. Being an abuse survivor, myself, I find that I'm beginning to have that fear.... it's nighttime and I'm beginning to have that fear of being alone. In the dark.  Two nights ago, I had a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) episode where, after looking at childhood pictures and reading an abuse survivor's strong words, I began to experience emotional memories - of being little and scared.  Why am I choosing this topic, again?  This class is the bane of my existence right now. Most people choose current event topics like the war or the presidency or something like that. But I'm just not political (besides knowing I don't like Bush) and I've had a hard time deciding on a topic that I am both interested in and that I know would make a good argument.  I've chosen this topic because I'm invested in it.  Is this topic too disturbing to use with college freshmen? I won't make them read anything graphic, of course. But what if there is someone in that class like me? Someone who is very sensitive to ideas and words? Someone who is battling her own abuse memories and comes into my class only to find that we're writing papers about what we think about former sexual offenders?  If I were to take this class, I would barely get a C.  But I'm PASSIONATE about this topic. The teacher has to be passionate about the topic, right? Aren't all the best teachers? And I KNOW I'm a good teacher!  Last year I taught two creative writing classes (this is all for my MFA in Poetry). Now THAT was up my alley.  Teaching Freshman Composition: Theory of Argument -- that is NOT up my alley.  But I know, I know, the teacher will learn as much as the student, right?  It's 12:21am.  I haven't slept through a whole night in weeks. I ought to go to bed now. But....lying in that bed, even if it is next to my boyfriend... I feel so vulnerable and young and alone.  I've tried to do some visualization and meditation before I go into the darkened bedroom, to prepare myself, to remind myself that I am loved and protected.  I do not have to be a little girl anymore.  Fin.

						   I am now at home. Upstairs in the loft, listening to Elvis. I wore a dress to work and had no pockets to put my key to the Inn or an important piece of paper with directions on it. I found myself placing them in my left bra cup. I felt so... Courtesan-ish. I bore items at my breast. How many people do that nowadays? It's only in the movies. But there I walked, down State Street, to the parking garage, knowing a key and a slight piece of paper were pressing against my left breast. I wondered if that meant they were more special. Because people think that things pressed to one' s breast are special.  I wondered, if I turned the corner, if the streets might turn to cobblestone and rain might begin to fall, lightly at first, then harder as I walked on in a deep red dress while I carried an umbrella, trying to look more sophisticated than I actually was.  I expected men to pop out of the pubs, whistle at me, call me names that weren't mine. London accents.  Maybe I wouldn't have enough money for an umbrella (or parasol) and I'd be ducking in and out of store canopies.  Fin.

						   Upon opening my eyes, I see a blog. It's an empty text box that begs for me to put words into it. So that is what I am doing. I am at work right now, the Inn, and I must be going home in 10 minutes. But I just couldn't wait to start this. To have my own universe on the internet? I do hope to create my own web page, but this will do for now. I'll have to do some research on what, exactly, a blog is. I suppose it is a journal that people may comment on. Does that mean I shall have my life critiqued? Don't we get enough of that already? But I would like to try out this... this blog thing... maybe it will grow on me. I am currently listening to my friend and up-and-coming singer/songwriter, Jen Cass, on the CD player here at work and waiting for 9:00 to roll around. I like working nights; I can do a lot of work on the computer and it's quiet.  I titled this blog "Romantic Circus Songs" because that is the name of one of my better poems - and also might be the name of my first collection of poetry I send out to be published. I thought about it and I thought, yes, my life can be thought of as Romantic Circus Songs. It's romantic, it's odd, it's fierce, it's intense.  I'm going to go home soon to my boyfriend of two and a half glorious and swinging-pendulum years. By that I mean, good times and bad. We are trying each other on for size. I must admit, it is a wonderful experience. I love him fiercely.  Well, I thank you for reading this. I am a poet, writer (for I write other things than just poems), Innkeeper, student, teacher, seeker, learner (yes that's my word), searcher and everything else you can think of naming a dreamy, sensitive, talented, creative and severely mixed-up 26 year old.  Peace and love to you on this Monday night. No doubt I will open my eyes again tomorrow to this blog and add a little something else.  Fin.
