      I cannot believe that DMB is supporting Kerry. I am a long time, hard core fan of DMB, but I have to say that the mere fact that they have decided to assist in a fund raising event for this a**hole just repulses me. I cannot believe that anyone would be so stupid as to actually support what these people believe in. I mean- accept it- we are in Iraq. Do the people of our country NOT KNOW or understand the cost of freedom isn't just money? Do they no know or understand that the BENEFIT that comes out of that cost is enormous? These jerks seem to take for granted that "Oh yeah, sure- I know people died in wars" but do they not understand that the result of those people dying is the fact that we can live in freedom? That we can say what we want, do what we want, live our lives without fear of retribution from our own government. These people are living contradiction- they want the freedom and everything that goes along with it, but are not willing to pay the price for it. No- our country does not DIRECTLY benefit from it at this very moment, but our decendants will, when they can walk freely in the streets in that country. When all of humankind is treated with dignity, respect and fairness. Freedom is a long, hard process. Support these people who are fighting for it!!! Don't BASH them for giving the gift of their LIVES for someone elses benefit!!

      Each night I lay down    To sleep in my soft bed While our soldiers use rocks and gear To rest their heads  I sit in my cushy office chair  While I do my quiet job While the police of our country  Fight an anti war mob  Some don’t understand Why our leaders are doing this They lead our troops to war So we can live in ignorant bliss  People are getting shot   And many are in pain So that freedom for people Who don’t understand will be gained  Our leaders motives I pray   Are all true and right To make our world better  The military must flex its might  It is so sad  That such giving people must die To prove that a jerk Has been feeding his people lies  They will soon see the leadership  Of their country unwind They will learn what it is like To be allowed to speak their minds  They don’t understand  That when this war is through Anything they please They will be able to say and do  The lives and sacrifices  That our soldiers make  So that each his own political view He will be able to take  So they no longer live  In an environment of oppression We all must endure This horrible time of aggression  They say that America Is a society of violence Yet they live in a country  Ruled with malevolence  They don’t even know What joy is coming their way For their babies will be born Into freedom one day  Someday only the old ones Will remember a time of tight reigns A time when our country gave lives For their decedents gains  Once we start believing  That we built our lives all alone We have forgotten the people  Who gave up their own  We must never forget  What our soldiers have done Over the course of time So many lives gone  The spirit of freedom They enforce with their guns So there will be a free world For all of our little ones

      What exactly does “happily ever after” mean? Do you know when you get there? How does one know if she is living the happily ever after? Is it when you have gone through all of the crazy life experiences and you are lying on your death bed reviewing them in your mind? Is it when you are ready to give birth to your first child and your heart is so overwhelmed with love for your husband and your child that you have no idea how on earth you ever lived without him or how you ever got so lucky? I need to know if this is it. Am I living the “happily ever after” that we read about in childhood storybooks?

      Until I see him again I don’t know when How long will it be Before his face again I’ll see  Suddenly small and frail He was once a strong man Relief from his illness  He could not gain  There was nothing we could do But to hold his hand In his weariness and pain  He could no longer stand  How we needed to care for him As he lay there in the bed Unable to move anything  Other than his head  His heart full of sadness  So much we could see How he didn’t want to leave Not his wife, his daughter nor even me.  Did he know he touched my soul As he waited for his death How I wished to be with him When he took his last breath  How I miss his eyes For years they would shine  Now only in pictures Looking into mine

      A charmer you have always been A beautiful angel you will be  Such a wonderful man I love So lucky that you love me  I want so bad to make this easier for you But it is just too hard see  To see your pain and your mourning Hurts deeply the heart inside of me  I will be back to see you soon I will be here again next week  Know in your heart that I will be sad That you may go home before me  If I don’t get to see you again on this earth Sadly, it is ok with me  For I know that I will see you again Because it will be for all of Eternity

      The music is God’s gift to us So beautiful it is An orchestra this beautiful Could only be His  They beckon me to listen By singing so loud And I look up into God’s sky Where there isn’t a cloud  Lying in bed Listening to the singing birds To describe the feeling There are no words  It is a beautiful treasure To the peaceful heart One of God’s wonderful Works of art  As the sun rises They sing away Telling me that in bed I cannot stay  Only as the sun rises Can we hear one of life’s joys Then the chirping dies down Barely even background noise  If I am not listening closely I may not even hear God’s personal orchestra A gift that he gave us so dear

      They say they are for the family - Here is what I see:     They are for partial birth abortions. Duh- no baby - no family. Oh- and No Person. They want to reduce the tax breaks for people who make $200k      The effect of this is that when someone like me comes along and wants to stay home with their kid, they suddenly have to remember that "Oh, my husband is going to have to make no more than $200 a year, or at least $250 (estimated) to compensate. If he hits 200 on the mark, we are going to be in worse shape than we will if he makes $190. On top of that, say one makes 60K and one makes 140k. The parent who make 60K (she makes such a low salary because of one thing: She is FEMALE- but that is another issue.) really doesn't make anything because by the time you take out day care and taxes, it is essentially gone. What is the point? She works so she can pay someone else to take care of baby all day, while she sits at a job site for what- 7 or 8 bucks an hour? Nope- not worth it. But if Husband makes $200k, she has to keep working to make up the difference for TAXES. (I haven't totally completed the logic in this theory yet, so it may be flawed.)   They think that Kerry can "Do a better job"      This is stupid. With no experience? This guy and his counterpart don't even show up for work NOW. What makes us think that he is going to show up for work if he is President? This is a man that BOUGHT his political endorsement with money that he got from some chick who has no class and lot's of luck. Money can buy ANYTHING- including a Presidential nomination. If it isn't with checks, it is with expensive parties, star studded events, etc. so that normal people can "rub elbows" with people who won't even remember their names. Ben Affleck? He is there so that he can bang one of Kerry's little girls... By his attending, it grabs the attention of the female 20-40 age group. Ahhhhhhhhh let's watch so we can see Ben- he's so hot. But really, he is being manipulated by an incredibly wealthy, incredibly corrupt group of people. Kerry is a man who uses his daughters to SELL him.   That is enough for now.

      So I have officially embarked upon this journey of insanity. I have officially given up my career in IT to focus on raising the little man. As I walked out of my office for the last time, I was a little sad- I had wanted that job soooo badly. And really, I was quite happy there. I wasn't doing as well as I wanted, however I had a great boss who was willing to work on any issues that were identified. I enjoyed it- but the call of motherhood was way too strong. To look at AJ in someone else's arms while he was falling asleep was way too much for me to handle. So, I gave up the great job, great social interaction and MONEY. What a shock- I have worked so hard for so long to get exactly the right working situation that I could retain while raising our child and I just tossed it out the door. Kind of ironic.

      Kerry has a lock on the formula that wins over a certain generation. He is, after all, teamed up with the Dave Matthews Band. Anyone who has been to one of their concerts lately can see that the entire musical performance of the Democratic convention was modeled after a Dave Matthews Concert. DMB knows the formula of success with the existing generation well and they are sharing access to an entire generation by sharing what they know. In fact, I wouldn't be suprised if they shared crowd footage. (I would like to see it again! I think I may have seen myself in the crowd on the tv, but I was sitting right here at home...)

      What we, as a nation, didn't want to happen as a result of 9/11:  1.)For people to forget. (What year was that?) 2.)For ANYONE to profit monetarily from it. (Does the name MOORE sound familiar.) 3.)For the events that happened that day to be used as political and manipulative device for retaining or obtaining power.   Response to #2: If Michael Moore was ANY kind of man, he would be donating every single penny of is his lying movie to charities for the victims of 9/11 and their descendants.   Response to #3: Did anyone notice how 9/11 is THE BASIS for the Kerry campaign thus far? That Michael Moore associates himself the same party seems me to be a negative association for Kerry at this point. If I were him, I would distance myself from him as much as possible.   With these points in mind, it is my opinion (not that you asked) that Kerry is not what is defined as a "Good Man".

      These people are actors, they are paid to be believeable. They are just playing a part when they are speaking out for a candidate. Actors and Actresses are not typically highly educated people and their focus in life is on their appearance. Though they may be nice, they have a reputation for being good at the party scene and not generally the kind of people we want our children to grow up to be like. Think about this when Glenn Close (of whom I used to be a fan) or any other celebrity publically endorses a presidential candidate. They aren't the smartest kids on the block, but they sure do look good. Do you really want to take advice from THEM?

      Hey guys, if you are paying any attention to the titles on your Blog accounts, you should be reading this one. The bad guys are going to wait until we are sitting happy again having let down our guard. Then they are going to let us have it and we are not even going to know what hit us. It will be hard and fast and it will wipe us out. They have money, knowledge, facilites as well as technical minds that do not have anything better to do than think.  These people look with excitement toward death and proceed with a life mission of killing as many people who won't convert as they possibly can.  THEY WANT TO KILL US and there is no way that we are going to be able to avoid it because we won't even know it is coming. If they can't kill all of us, they are going to just do it a little at a time until they completely cripple our society and inflict pain on each and every person who does not believe precisely what they do, and even some who do share their beliefs.

      This is the guy who, along with the Clinton's (and we know what kind of people THEY ARE), endorses the actions performed by a (notice I say not "our") Potential First Lady of the United States,&nbsp; as acceptable and appropriate in today's American society, including saying a vulgarity to a reporter in front of a video camera&nbsp;and denying it in basically the&nbsp; next sentence. If this is what he thinks is appropriate behavior, what would he think is appropriate when he would be representing the United States as whole (withhold the slam)- to people who hold our fates in their hands? Did his people even have the time to read the 9/11 Commission report? For God's sake, he was out pitching a baseball at some ball park while Bush was reading what the report had to say! He has a track record of being non-participative, as does his Vice Presidential Candidate. Kerry has the highest non participation rate and Edwards has the second highest. Why would either of them work harder than they currently do now when placed in new positions?

      Good ol', church going John Kerry and his camp also support gay marriage. Now, tell me, can two people of the same sex create another child? The definition of "Family" is "HUSBAND, Wife, child". Husband implies "male" and wife implies "female, therefore a "family" should contain one and only one of each "type" out of the two in existance, not "two of one or more than one of the same sex with a child make a family." That kind of family wouldn't be able to naturally have a child! Let's talk about the definition of family, John Kerry.
