      I haven't updated for a long time guys. Sorry if you have been anticipating on me updating. I went to a trip to France (Normandy, north of France) by ferry and stayed there for a few days. It was fun! My group leader is called Robert from Scotland. He looks like Tim Henman, the famous English tennis player. Seriously, he does. We met some really rough guys there. And Daisy, the desperate one and Olivia, the hypocondriact (however you spell it) found guys to dance with. Ew... Nobody else danced with boys. What losers! I will write again later. I have got loads to do today. Mainly homework cos I have left them all to the last minute!!! *argh* I've got Physics and Biology and Latin prep to finish. And I have to do some of my German project as well. Busy busy busy...  My phone is not connecting!!! Vodafone!!! What is wrong with you???? I can't text nor can I call!!!! This is driving me crazy! Plus having 22p on my phone doesn't help either. I need to get my credit today after school.  Can you believe that England lost to Portugal? Were you watching that match? If you were, post some comments cos I would like to read them.  That's all for today folks! Check back again tomorrow or later. Daddy I need your help with Biology!!! We're learning about drugs and alcohol. Whether we can use them medically or whether it's abused. What the uses and harmful effects are etc. H E L P!!!!

      My end of term examinations have finally finished after two weeks!!!!!! *phew* Now the nail-biting experience is getting the papers back. *lol* I wish you guys luck who are still doing exams at DGS!  I have received a message from a DOGA person that Dr Symunds has died. This is a memorial for her at my website. Dr Symunds: You'll be happy in heaven. Anyway, I'm going to town today. *argh* I wanna meet Josh again. Cos I wanna take a piccie of him on my camera phone. Dammit. Write again later!

      I saw Harry potter the movie on Saturday night!!!! It was okay. A bit shorter than the first two ones. It was much funnier though cos they've changed the American director to an English director. Hermione held Ron's hands? *ugh* And they forgot loads of stuff from the book! The Firebolt didn't come till the end of the movie! Seriously! That, I thought, was weird. And they didn' mention how Professor Lupin could use the Marauder's Map! That bit was important! Professor Lupin was Moony. James Potter was Prongs. Peter Pettigrew (Yuck! He's soo ugly in the film!) was Padfoot. And Sirius Black was something else... Don't remember. This is very important, they shouldn't have skipped that fact! The dementors were sick! A bit scary... Didn't expect them to suck people's souls out like that. They looked a bit like the Nine cursed Kings of Lord of the Rings. Hehe... P.S Danni, get Mike's mobile no.!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Like loads of them!! *aah* There were like 6 boys and 2 girls. *lol* I am not going to comment on Will cos... You know... But Josh is okay. And Marcus was quite friendly. That's all. Gotta do some RS and Latin studying!

      I have done 5 exams this week already: History, Math, Technology, German and Music. My History exam was crap cos it was sooooo long! There were 8 questions and each of them were mostly worth 12 marks. It was practically like writing 8 essays in one paper!!! *argh* It is impossible to finish it  fully  in 1h. Even Mrs Morwood said that it's impossible. She even had to make her paper longer cos of Rookie's paper. I only finished it 5min before we had to stop. My German paper was even more s***. I can't believe myself. *ugh* I didn't know what 'getranken' meant. *to myself* It means 'to drink' you idiot!! Techonology and Music was okay. Math was sooo easy though. Hope I got more than 90%!!!!!! I've got Science, Religious Studies, Latin, English, French and Geography next week. Wish me luck guys! I have been going to your BBS Emz! So you've got to credit me!!! I wish I could go to your Xangas buddies but it's blocked. So, nah... Danni, after the exams, I am going to send you the letter, and you must reply back!!!!!!!! And reply to my e-mails!

      I am testing to see how this works. I'm glad I found this website. I can ask my friends to read my updates here now! I have a Xanga account but it is blocked at school so I can't use it to update and read other people's updates at school anymore. That is until the holidays start... Anyway, I'm going to ask Jessica and Christie to post this blogger thingie to their Xangas so that people can read my updates here!! If you still want to check out my Xanga it is www.xanga.com/snowboard_freak Okay? That's it for now...

      It is the second semi-finals of the football EURO 2004 today!! Yesterday, Netherlands played against Portugal. Portugal won! Tonight, Greece is playing against Czech Reupblic. I'll keep you posted on the results. People at DGS, if you think I'm boy-crazy. You're most probably half-right and half-wrong. What about people in your own class? Like Claudia? Why do you have to pick on me? It's none of your business anyway. If you want to talk about me, who isn't even part of your class anymore, you should say it to my face. Cos otherwise, you wouldn't be brave. If you can't say it to my face, then maybe you should just leave it and go back to your own little worlds.  *after the match*  Can you believe that Greece beat Czech Republic in the last 20 sec? It was 0-0 but then someone scored 20 sec before the whistle blew. I feel really sorry for the Czech Republicans. I wanted them to win. Not Greece! I certainly didn't expect Greece to beat them! Well, I just have to hope that Portugal will beat Greece and take away the ERUO 2004 cup!!!
