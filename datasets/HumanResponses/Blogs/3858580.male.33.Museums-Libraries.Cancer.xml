       Not bad, not great!  Sometimes you just need the escape, sometimes you just really really don't want to think too much. With the hype surrounding  I, Robot  I tried really hard not to put too much into it. I saw this movie with open mind and I actually liked it very well. I sat through the movie and enjoyed it. But the thinker in me had some complaints and while these two factors can go together.... they didn't this time. So, in short: total battle between two opposites.... the result cannot be anything but an enjoyable "middle"!  Performances in a movie like this don't have to be good. The action and the visual effects is what we're seeing here. However, I found some sense-no sense in the script and again... two opposites battled. Maybe if I'll see it again, I'll like it more or less... but time will tell. Will Smith is Will Smith, all others are okay but the robots are great. Of course you'll always be able to tell... "hey... this is so fake... this is not real." Well, in that case I say: come on!!! It's a fantasy... with a message. But ... look at the  Terminator -films ... highly enjoyable but realistic?? So, don't fall into this trap. Visual effects are evolving every year and I'm sure masterpieces like Lord of the Rings-trilogy (of course all five star films!) will survive the test of time... but improvements are being made.  I, Robot  is a great fun and good in visual effects.  It's difficult to talk about this movie a lot more. I didn't read the stories and I've heard it's baring little resemblence to Asimov's book... only the title. So... I cannot judge how that material is handled. I guess I have to watch it again...  All in all ... total struggle between opposites. My opinion feels like a child from divorcing parents! But enjoyable film - really.  ***  out of  *****  stars.

       Best comedy of all time!  I love a good laugh, I love a good scare, but in both instances ... if a scare or a laugh fails - it fails miserably!! You cannot half-laugh, you cannot be semi-scared - well not in my book, but ... a good laugh is a great thing. And while some comedies don't stand the test of time, there are some who really deliver ... ALWAYS!  His Girl Friday  is a film that I have loved ever since I first saw it as a teenager. It is the perfect example of how a great comedy is supposed to be. It has been remade, it wasn't an original idea - but the script, the acting, directing... everything is superb! Cary Grant is my favourite actor of all time and he shows why in&nbsp;this picture. Working with Rosalind Russell in the leads, and also great performances by supporting cast (Bellamy is a hoot), this must have been the actor's dream. &nbsp; Howard Hawks is a master filmmaker. There is no doubt about it. The film is made in 1940 and over 60 years later this is still one of the best comedies of all time - in my mind the best! The storyline is probably known to most film enthusiasts, but it revolves around the news paper editor (Grant) and his ex-wife (Russell) soon to get married again (to&nbsp;Bellamy)&nbsp;- in the middle of a murder case and a hanging. The newspapers agents who cover the story are all hurrying and competing to deliver the best story but Hildy Johnson (Russell) always seems to get the best story. And while she wants to get out of the news business, Walter Burns (Grant) promises to let her go, only after covering this last story. All the time Walter Burns plays tricks to keep Hildy Johnson longer in the game (doesn't really wanna let her go) and Hildy's husband to be, Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy), finds himself in the midst of a craziness he isn't familiar with. The story has an ending but people should see the film. A delightful comedy, a well written comedy, perfectly casted comedy... everything is as it should be? &nbsp; "What should a great comedy be like?" - The simple answer to that is: Watch  His Girl Friday ! &nbsp; All in all ... the perfect comedy. Top performances with great script and greater one-liners and Howard Hawks and Cary Grant at their best ... well, Mr. Grant was always great!!  *****  out of  *****  stars - full house!

       Historic achievement in the world of filmmaking!  Many critics have affection for the older movies, the era before 1974 or so. For some reason they won't allow any film released after that to become a better one. Fortunately this is not with all. Few films have have sparked as much media frenzy as Titanic and judging by pure numbers at the box office - one might understand why. The "most popular" film of all time!! Well, it had negativity beforehand: very big budget, a controversial director, constant reports about bad temper or accidents at the scene etc. etc. It wasn't expected to do much, critics waited happily to tear it down.... but what happens?? We all know that. Box office records broken and 11 Oscars, along with numerous other awards. Still, it remains among the most "hated" films today, and people love to bash it. I myself get never tired of continuing to express my love for the film. Try me any day of the week, anytime ... anywhere. Nothing could change the fact that  Titanic  remains in my Top-5 best films of all time.   So, what is so great about  Titanic ?? Well, actually ... everything! Cameron did a visual miracle - and no one has equalled him or surpassed him in that brilliance, except one little hobbit from New Zealand: Peter Jackson. You can always pinpoint a minor detail in every movie, but the insanity of  Titanic  lies in the attention to details: The building of the ship, the decorations, the costumes, the cups, the dishes, the carpets... everything was done with an insanely detailed approach. The performances are great, especially with the two ladies portraying Rose, and the production superb. The cinematography, the visual effects, the decoration, the fact that it was based on a true story... the divine music of James Horner (again, only to be equalled by the brilliance of Danny Elfman's work in  Edward Scissorhands  and Howard Shore in the  LOTR -trilogy).... = everything made this film very great.  I don't think I have to go over the storyline... it's a simple lovestory based on an actual historic event - which in my mind describes the hypocrisy of mankind so clearly and how true it is that mankind is next to nothing when attacked by nature. To build a ship that is supposed to be unsinkable.... hmmm .... never say never! I have studied a bit about the actual accident, and it would be great to ask: Have we learned from our mistakes? I'm gonna leave that to each and everyone to answer that.  Have I been approached with the words: "You're crazy, Titanic is so awful!" ??? Yes, I have! But fortunately, mankind is made of different individuals and every opinion is just. I am not gonna attack  Titanic -haters, but I love a good debate about the film.  All in all ... a true gem in film history. Top-5 member of the best films of all time!  *****  out of  *****  stars! FULL HOUSE!

       Funny and surprisingly good!  Every so often you find yourself watching or reading or listening to something that at first you were sure it wasn't anything special, but ... to your pleasant surprise the product in question turns out to be a great joy. In this case, I am talking about the latest Ben Stiller movie -  Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story . The cast is highly enjoyable (Stiller, Vaughn and Taylor starring) and the script is witty. I have no idea who the director is - Rawson Marshall Thurber, who also scripted - but this is a true gem.  Yes, the cast was great, and although I love Ben Stiller in almost every movie, I really thought Vince Vaughn was a hoot. Also, the endless cameos were hilarious (Hank Azaria, Gary Cole and David Hasselhoff to name a few...) along with funny supporting cast.  The storyline is simple: Stiller plays White Goodman, a self-centered owner of a big gym chain who wants to buy the poorly managed but goodhearted gym that Peter La Fleur (Vaughn) is the owner of. La Fleur has 30 days to pay 50.000 dollars, otherwise he'll lose the establishment to Goodman. Accidentally, one of La Fleur's staff members (or customer...) stumbles on a solution: to compete in dodgeball tournament. After learning this, Goodman decides to enter his team into the competition as well, and ... well - how does the story end? You get the hint from the title.  There are lot of quotes from this movie and I'm sure many of them will survive in the social life in the future. Gary Cole is for example hilarious in his role as Cotton McKnight. One of his many quotes: "This is an event more exciting than the World Cup, the World Series, and World War II combined" ... and another one: "It's time to separate the weak from the chafed, the men from the boys, the awkwardly feminine from the possibly Canadian." I could go on, but I'm not gonna. I'm just gonna tell you to see this movie, because it is a funny movie, it's a well written movie, it's a well acted movie... it's something what I call: a surprising gem!  All in all ... a funny and good-hearted gem - Vaughn and Stiller are great!  ****  out of  *****  stars!

       Great movie with Hanks in top form!  Tom Hanks has been my favourite actor for a long long time. My second favourite actor of all time after Cary Grant. But he has his not-so-great days and not-the-greatest movies. But this year he has done it twice. In  The Ladykillers  and now in  The Terminal . Both fun movies although I would prefer  The Terminal . Steven Spielberg is the same, he has his ups and downs and although this isn't greatest movie, you cannot expect him to do that always. So, "high five" to Spielberg and Hanks for pulling this off.  Pulling this off... well, this is a story loosely based on a true story about an Iranian trapped in a French airport. Here Tom Hanks's character is trapped at a New York airport because while he is flying to America a revolution explodes in his country which overthrowns the government and the US doesn't approve it. He is therefore a man without a country for ... I think 10-11 months in the picture. During this time he gets to know many of the airport's employees and this is wonderfully portrayed. Hanks never falls out of character and delivers another Oscar-nominated worthy performance. Zeta-Jones is beliavable as the stewardess he falls for and Stanley Tucci is wonderful as the head of security at the airport - sort of like his "arch villain" in the movie if you have to talk in such terms.  This is an easygoing film with great music and great cinematography. It drags a bit, the story, but not to such extend that it destroys the movie. I wasn't completely happy about the ending, but looking back... it sure wasn't bad either. The reason for Hanks visiting New York has sparked discussions all over the internet and that it could have been handled easier (like Hanks's character asking some of his friend doing this for him since he couldn't go to the city) but when you think about it... and realize that he had to do it himself because of his father... it works out well.  A really feel-good movie, Spielberg's clichés are there and sentimentality, but hey... occasionally we do like them very much.  All in all ... a great feel-good movie - with top performances.  ****  out of  *****  stars!

       Better than the original, but not quite top quality  This film is close to being great on every level! What the original lacked, here it is delivered. It feels as though that the first two films are for character development and films 3-??? will be more and more action. Which is good, and don't get me wrong... I love character development, but the film felt slow at times.  Tobey Macguire is perfect in the title role, James Franco evolves with his character and unfortunately I am not too familiar with the comics, and I cannot say that I approve with the ending totally. Okay, let's see how Peter and Mary Jane go along, but with Harry also in the "I know"-group... things could get complicated. I wished peace and sanity would have prevailed with Harry, since I didn't like the Green Goblin half as much as I liked the Dr. Octopus. Which brings me to Alfred Molina, I don't know why but I didn't like the idea of him playing the villain... it didn't seem right. But how glad am I by being wrong? Very!! Kirsten Dunst doesn't have much and she delivers okay... I have seen her better in almost any other movie. I didn't like Margot Kidder in Superman either - because I do believe both roles could have been cast better. I love Dunst in general but here.... not as much.   The special effects are way better, the direction is clearer and with former mentioned character development... I find the script very good (minus the last minute with Harry...) Scriptwriters for the third movie might surprise me with some greatness but that remains to be seen. Danny Elfman is the king of movie music, along with the elite group of James Horner, John Williams and Howard master Shore.  All in all... very nice movie - better than the original. **** out of ***** stars!
