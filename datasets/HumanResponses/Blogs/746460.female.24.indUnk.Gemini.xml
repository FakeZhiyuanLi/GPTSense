      Alright there are a lot of html guides that you can find by enetring a search in the same title.  I would try to show you on here but unfortunately I can't cause blogger converts all html despite seperation of tags so your best bet to find html source codes and othe script is to go to webdevelopers.com.  They also have a lot of other resources.  Please feel free to investiagte the features on my blog as well  http://manicdigest.blogspot.com

      I have tried out many blogging programs out there.  And I have to say Blogger/Blog-spot is the most user-friendly blogger on the net that I have came across so far.  There is not type or caracter limit restrictions.  Your domain name is easy to remember unlike live journal or dead journal.  Blogger is also very html friendly.  And now with free image hosting from photobucket.com you can add lots of visual interest to your blog for free.  There are many resources out there and not everybody knows where to find them.  So that is what this blog is for.  I am in no way claiming to be an expert, I am just organizing the info and putting it all in one place.  I am merely a puppet for the man.  LOL.  Comments or questions you can post in the comment segment, and I will do the best to get you awnsers or find someone else who knows what the hell to do.  Graci, Tiffany, author of http://manicdigest.blogspot.com

      Hex color codes are a great way to customize your web template without having to purchase designs.  You can make it your own without going overboard.  Hex color codes will look something like this in your template:  color: #000000  the color codes are usually six digits but not always.

						   I did the Bodies in Motion Workout/toning.  It was not that hard for my first day!  I was so happy.  Don't get me wrong, it hurt, and I wanted to give up, but in the end it wasn't so bad.  I was suprised.  I need to get a scale.  I dont have one now and I have no clue as to how much I weigh.

						   I took a diest pill at 10 am, worked out to Bodies in Motion on Fit Tv for about 30 min, I have not ate breakfast yet (I have another 20 min that I have to wait.  But when I do I will probably have a bowl of cereal and a vitamin.     For Lunch I will probably make 2 pieces of garlic cheese toast with tbs. of ranch.  DInner I will be having Veal, Potatoes and Mixed Veggies.  I am going to  *try*  to take a walk tonite after the kids go to bed.

						   But I am back on top of it again.  I started taking Diet Life Pills, and I worked out for 45 min yesterday and took at brief 10 min walk at lunch.  I ate some broiled chicken for breakfast with a small portion of wild grain rice. I eat another small portion of rice for lunch (maybe 1/3 of a cup) and had 4 tacos for dinner.  I drank at least 12 8 oz. glasses of water, and took a multi vitamin.

						   I NEED to loose weight.  Depsite the fact tha no one believes me when I say that I have gotten up to 222 lbs.  I HAVE!  I am sick of it so I am planning a vigorous diet.  My Diet specs are as follows:  I can consume 1200-1550 calories a day 40-52 grams of fat 165-213 grams of carbs 45-58 grams of protien (the equivalent of 1.5 ounces.  I nearly blew that one today just with a two cheeseburger meal at McDonald's!  So yes I will be having a Smart Ones for dinner.  I plan to excercise 45 min a day and walk at night. 8 glasses of water. A multi-vitamin. A stool regulator. And a diet pill.  Hopefully I will be able to stick with this.

      I sit all alone in a world made of stone. I try to break free, but the concrete is solid 'round my soul.  My heart aches, it swells with constriction from the stone that is my prison.  I love you, I need you, but I can't have you.  I love you, I need you, but I can't have you.  I walk through the tunnels in my mind. I try to reason why.  I sit all alone in this world. I'm a prisoner to myself to my love for you.  I will crumble eventually-I will die lonely.  I will cry every night til 3.  I will pray that someday you'll be with me.   I love you, I need you, but I can't have you.  I love you, I need you, but I can't have you.

      I am not your typical girl,  I don't live in the typical world. Diamonds weren't meant for me. I'd be better off in your fantasy.  I like to walk on by, all those cheaters who fucking lie. I laugh when you cry. I can't seem to get this together, and I DONT KNOW WHY!  I can smell you from across the room. I can smell your sex in the air. I don't want a man, it's not in my plans. I just want to be one night of extacy!  I'm the girl who you used to know, although sometimes I do not let it show! I am sweet somewhere but, GOD DON'T ASK ME WHERE!  I just want to be I just want to be I just want to be  In your fantasy!  I just want to be I just want to be I just want to be  In your fantasy!

      It's easy, so damn easy.  It's easy, so damn easy.  What we do, what we say, what we're willing to give away to make us happier anyway.  She left her morals at the tavern door she entered the room and danced on the floor one, two, three, four too much beer for the bar whore  The all whisper  she's so sleazy, so damn sleazy.  she's so sleazy, so damn sleazy.  what she does, what she says, what shes willing to give away. "What a fucking slut!" they all say.  He laughs at himself as other people insult him publicly. He jokes about his insecurities. He sells his dignity with each passing laugh, just to fit into the bar scene that sees him as a hack.  The all whisper behind his back  He's so stupid, so damn stupid.  He's so stupid, so damn stupid.  What he does, what he says, what he's willing to give away. They all proclaim, what a fucking shame.  Another one comes in from the cold, braggin about the shit he has stold. He's an asshole, self proclaimed. Starts fights, just so people will recognize his name. No one cares, they all laugh.  ANd this is what they say behind his back  He's an ass, such a damn ass.  He's an ass, such a damn ass.  What he says, what he fucking does, what he is willing to give away. Some day that stupi asshole will fucking pay.

      Set aside, not so long ago. Set aside by all those times you lied. All the good in me has slowly died. No more tears to be cried.  You never cared about me, all this hurt inside me, you never cared about me no, no, no all this hurt is left inside of me!  Left alone, too many fucking times. All that's left are these tragic rhymes. Left alone, punished for your crimes. Left behind, to pay your unpaid fines!  You never cared about me, all this hurt inside me, you never cared about me no, no, no all this hurt is left inside of me!  Loneliness is my hardship. Something in which I was not  equipped to deal with. Loneliness is my life, Loneliness is my prison! No one can save me now, Because of you!  You never cared about me, all this hurt inside me, you never cared about me no, no, no all this hurt is left inside of me!

      You walk on to the set strung out, sold out, and a comprimising bet. You live in a decade that has died long ago your head is in the clouds, your nose is in the snow. You ---you, dont get me no more! Hell, you never did before  despite the winding the circular motion in my head all these feelings for you, they have gone dead despite the winding the circular motion in my head all those years feeding your ego they are simply DEAD  You think that you are so damn special you think that you are a star but honey, your nowhere close,no, no, no, not by far! You wanted me to love you you wanted me to be all those things that you figured you were owed despite the comprimises imposed upon me!  despite the winding the circular motion in my head all these feelings for you, they have gone dead despite the winding the circular motion in my head all those years feeding your ego they are simply DEAD  No I am writting you this song, I final tribute I am putting into words, what you never seemt to see No You will understand, or just linger in your self indulged stupidity The saddness in your eyes, is as fake as your unledgible lies Your arrogance is through, I will cut you off at the knees You can beg cry plead and ask please but now its personal, time to kill the disease  despite the winding the circular motion in my head all these feelings for you, they have gone dead despite the winding the circular motion in my head all those years feeding your ego they are simply DEAD

      You are suppost to be the one I look up to. You are the one one is supposed to protect and defend me. You turned your back on your child, you turned your back on the law. You promoted the sickest of all sins, by talking to him at all.  I CANT FORGET THIS! I CAN NOT ERASE THIS! I try to heal but you push the salt into my wounds.  I cant forget this  I can not forgive this. I will not forget this  I WILL NOT FORGIVE THIS!  These scars I carry inside, you will not see them you will not see them no no no no But for me  I CAN NOT HIDE THEM  I WILL NOT HIDE THEM  no no no no I WILL NOT HIDE THEM not for you not for anyone!  This pain is killing me This pain is killing me I only needed some validation This pain is torture This pain I suffer I suffer alone!  How dare you ask me to forgive him, How dare you challange my convictions! Who the hell are you to alli with the enemy  YES THE ENEMY!  You turned your back, LYOU TURNED YOUR BACK  Now you are the enemy.

      I was due to have Seth January 7th.  I could not wait, I had gotten gestational diabetes and was huge and uncomfortable.  I was almost 300lbs.  I hated being prego.  Well the 7th came and passed.  The 10th came and passed, the 13th came and passed, the 15th they decided to scheduel an inducement.  So I went in on January 16th at 9pm to be induced. I started to contract and I was afraid of an epidural so I took injections of stadohl instead.  Well the first injectin was good, it kept things under control.  The 2nd one didn't work as well.  The 3rd one barley worked at all, and the 4th was pointless medication use.I had had it, it was the morning and they decided to pop my bag of waters and that was the worst pain I had experienced, this woman stuck her entire hand up my vagina and poped my water with a platic croche hook.  I wanted to kill people at this point.  I clecnched down so bad I made the woman cry.  She kept asking me to relax through her tears and I told her to get her fucking hand out of my crotch, and she yelled I cant unless you relax.  SO I let her take her hand out.  Then I was like I want the fucking epidural! NOW! I waited for what sempt like forever for the doctor to get there.  When he finally did I remembered how scared I was of the whole epidual concept.  I got through the procedure ok, and boy was I glad when those meds started working.  I could actually sleep and feel comfy again I was like woo hoo!  Well at 8:30pm they woke me to check me and I had only dialated to 6cm.  They were like we are comming close to the 24 hr mark after rupturing your membranes, we need to do an emergency c-section.  I was terrified.  I just knew something worse was wrong, we were going to die.  I couldn't breath.  Every minute semt surreal.  They got Jeff suited up, so that he could be in there with me, they shaved me, and rolled me off to the OR.  I was in a state of panic and they started pumping all these anti nerve drugs in me to get me to relax. All through the procedure someone was at my head giving me medications.  I felt the tugging and the pulling as the pulled my son from my abdomen.  I fell in love when I heard him cry.  I had not seen him yet, I only heard a faint little cry.  He was mine.  He was allo the perfect features of me and my husband combined.  All the sudden They did some thing and It made me feel real comfortable, and Jeff peaked over the sheet and they were sucking the placenta out of my womb.  LOL I am glad he did not tell me at the time because I would have freaked out.  Well Litlle Seth was now A member of the McDonald family, I stayed in the hospital for 5 days, 5 really long long days.  And my son was fine, and I was fine.  Life changed.  Everything that was important before semt trivial now.

      We came back home to Michigan in September, with all the shit in Florida still lumming.  Jeff was really distressed about not seeing his kids.  Weeks, months, phone calls and court appointments went by.  After we had came home from Florida I enrolled in school, and got a job at Little Caesar's.  I was doing ok but Jeff was certainly not the same.  Then in May I found out I was pregnant with Seth.  Jeff was much more supportive this time around.  But it became a very sad notion that Jeff's kids weren't even able to hear that they were going to have a new brother.    We tried to deal.  We moved into a new place, and we patiently waited for the courts in Michigan to but Angie on trial for contempt.  One day In late AUgust nearly a year after the whole Florida incident and Jeff not being able to see his kids, Angie calls.  "I am ready for you to be able to see the kids now."  "we don't need to go to court, you can pick them up this weekend."  Jeff was pissed, it was real obvious her intent at this point.  Jeff told her to get bent, that he was taking her to court.  Well the court date was for that week and they finally got a specified visitation order.  And he was seeing them every weekend.  I was about 5 months pregnant.    Well now that shit was for the most part settled, we decided to getr married.  We married more for insurance purposes than we did anything, I mean we had love fore each other too, but It was more about politics getting married, then anything.  So in September 2000 we made an appointmentr fot the Justice of the peace.  Monday morning Sept. 18 we were heading off to the court house with Jeff's parents as witnesses.  I wanted to run so bad.  I was so nervous I must have puked several times. I was scared I was giving my life away.  And really I was.  Getting married soon to have a baby.  But at least we were together, all of us as a family.  We had a simple marriage, and no reception, the kids were with us and Seth was on his way.  Things were alright, for now.

      Jeff and I were living together, well if you could call it that.  Jeff worked out of town as a lineman and was only home during the weekends.  We had his kids every weekend , except the weekend he went to Ohio for reserve duty.  SO I pretty much had the rule of the roost.  But it was lonely, and I do not know how many times the thought had crossed my mind to beg my father to let me come back home, but I knew if I did, It would just be the same.  Well One weekend Jeff was home and we discussed TDY to Tampa, Florida for a period of 3 months in the summer.  He wanted me to go.  I thought this was wonderful I would get to see him everyday and I loved Florida.  So in June of 1999 we headed down to Tampa Florida, Jeff had made arrangements to see his children for 2 weeks starting around the 4th of July.  This had been difficult because Angie (his ex-wife) was not to fond of the fact that Jeff was finally happy, and seeing someone 5 years younger.  But in any event we got it all worked out.  Things were great.  My 19th Birthday was awesome.  We went to the Red Lobster on the Courtney Campbell Cause way and Jeff had ordered me a beer and no one even bothered to ask me for I.D.  Well July we headed up to Ocala to Jeff's grandparent's house to meet with his parents and the kids.  It was fun.  We had a blast.  Things even went well for the first week.  I was watching the kids during the day while Jeff was working on base.  ALL the sudden the kids started acting out.  They are destroying things just being out right disrespectful, and doing things that were dangerous and risky.  I had no reason to believe it would be like this, they were always good when we had them on the weekends. And besides the were only 6 and 3.    Well two weeks had passed.  I had found out that I was pregnant, and I was dealing with the stress of watching two kids that needed constant supervision so they did not injure themselves or each other.  Jeff came home one evening and I asked him what he wanted to do about this.  The kids were really more than I could handle.  I was pregnant, I was depressed cause I was miles away from friends and family.  I felt alone, isolated and trapped.    Jeff seemt less than enthused to have more finaciall responsibility with some one he had not even been with for a year.  He did not want me to keep it, I had not graduated from school yet,  and we barely knew each other.  This broke my heart because despite what was best for me, I wanted to keep the baby.  But I eventually gave in and had the most painful abortion man had ever concocted.. It used chemicals.  I was only 2 weeks gestation when I went to the clinic.  The gave me two shot of methotroxate in the side.  Then the gave me cyotec tablets to insert in myself that night when I went home.  Well, they weren't very good at elaborating on how terrible this would feel.  What basically happened is the cytotec tablets forced me into labor.  I had contractions until I expelled what would have been my first child.  The pain was unbearable.  I wanted to die.  I wanted to crawl in a hole and die.  This was the first time Jeff had called ANgie and asked her to take the kids back home. They had been with us 2 weeks, he figured it was time to get them home so shit didn't get more out of hand than it already was.  Angie refused, she infact asked Jeff to keep them 2 more weeks.  Jeff told her that he did not think that this woul be a good idea but we were finacially unable to make the trip all the way back to Michigan.  So while I was layed up and depressed I was in a situation to watch his two kids while they basically tortured me for not being their mother, for not letting them go home.  I fell into a deeper depression because all I could think is if someone he is now divorced from was good enough to have his kids, then what is the matter with me.    At the 4 week mark the children's behavior became unmanageable.  Jeff called Angie to set up a drop off point and day.  But to our suprise Angie was not comming.  She needed us to keep them two more weeks.  Jeff advised he of the situation, and she was like "oh well, I have to deal with that all the time, I am in school right now and can't miss any days, I can't come get them now."  So very much against my will we kept the children for yet another 2 weeks this is when the kids behavior became explosive.  The morning that everything came to a head was just a few days prior to the 6 week mark.  Jayne had woken early and took her brother into the bathroom attempted to feed him nail polish remover and somehow managed to get the top off the mouth wash and tried to feed him that.  She then covered his face with shaving cream and climed up on top of the sink, hung around the door frame opened the hall way closet and got Jeff's razor, and was swipping it through the air towards Daniel's face when I walked in.  Jeff spanked Jayne and lefta bruis on he butt.  He called ANgie told her what the situation was, and Angie still did not want to come and get the kids.  After Jeff basically threatened to give them to social services is when Angie reluctantly agreed to come get the children.  No sooner did we drop them off she turned around and contacted law enforcement to press charges on Jeff for the bruise on Jayne's bottom.  They took him to jail.  I was so scared, I called Jeff's parents back here in Michigan and told them what had happened.  They western unioned me some money for bail.  ANd I went to a bonds man and got him out.  We continued our stay in Florida until he was done with his TDY.  Then we returned to Michigan to await a trail date.  It was dismissed towards February.  But Angie still refused to allow  Jeff visitation.    It was appealled and resolved appealed, ect. It finally was not officially over til earlier this year!  Jeff did get vistation though A year after the incident, but we had to charge her with contempt to get it.  Florida was awful, but it brought me and Jeff closer together.  Hell, by the time Jeff got to see his kids, We were already pregnant with my son.

      When I was a teenager, my father was extremely controlling.  At 17 I got a job at Meijers and saved money I had no real social life.  I went to school and worked.  My father hated all my friedns indifferent to who they were.  He would search and find reasons to not like people that I hung out with.  On my 18th birthday I had save enough money to combine with the savings bond my grandmother had left me to buy a car-that my dad had picked out.  He put the title and the insurnce and the loan for the remaining portion in his name.  I was not happy about this but I figured I am getting a car, just shut up and roll with it.  Well at 18 working full time 3rd shift over the summer I paid the insurance and payment without problem.  I had all this responsibility and no freedom.  I had to beg to go to the gas station at the corner in my car. If I managed to get permission to hang with my friends I was expected to be home by 8pm on the weekends.  My dad played music and left the house at 8, and did not want the trouble of worrying about me while he was at the bar. Well I got sneaky, real sneaky.  I began to make up days that I was suppost to work, and do what I wanted.  I started hanging out with gang bangers, doing drugs, becoming violent, having multiple sex partners. I thank god, that I was smart enough to use protection.   I got real accustomed to living a double life.  I had my days which consisted of being an admirable student, and responsible worker.  Then there was the nightimes, were I was a vicious druggie with an axe to grind.  My dad had no clue the entire time.   Infact I would have probably died living that life had Jeff not come along.  Jeff was 8 years older than me and was a reservist.  He had 2 children from a previous marriage.  And I fell in love with his warmth.  His life situation inspired me to change so he would want to be with me.  I changed slowly, but eventually I was on the right track.  And it got even better after I moved in with him, out of flint, and away from the influences that encouraged my prowless behavior.

      I live in Michigan, and have lived here all my life.  I live less than 30 min away from the hospital where I was born.  I hate it here!  Its pretty, but cold! I think we are one of the most overcast states.    I was born in Flint.  Which is a ghetto town, that used to thrive because all the GM shops, but as they closed them down the more and more ugly things got.  I was fortunate as a real young child that My father worked for GM.  He worked Out of Lake Orion and we lived in a small SUburb South of Flint for my grammer school years.  When my parents were divorced, however, we ended up in Flint again.  Flint to me is the toilet bowl of Michigan-It's where all the shit goes.  For those who don't know check out the documentary Roger and Me- It is about Flint and is pretty accurate.    I went through highschool high most of the time.  I could not deal with my surroundings, and then there was the dissorder.  In any even we moved several times around the Flint/Burton area.  Before I knew it  I was 18 a senior in high school, with a job that was just under the amount of hours it would require to be a full time job.  I had gotten myself a car, and A goal for the future.  I started dating this incredible guy (even though he was 8 years older than me.)  Well my father and I got into a fight (this was rather common)  He called me out of my name and I did so to him, to make a long story short I ended up kicked out of the house.  I moved in with the guy I was seeing to an old rickety trailor in Mt. Morris.  We fell in love and decided to go to Tampa together when he had one of his military excursions.  Tampa was beautiful.  We were there for 3 months. A lot of very bad things happened down there as well, but I will get into that later.  When we came home In September, we were especially bonded.  We did everything together.  Then in May I was pregnant.  Jeff knew I was not going to get rid of it.    So we did what we had to do.  We moved out of the trailor into an expensive 3 bedroom townhome in Flint township on the border of Grand Blanc.  We got married in September of 2000.  Things were great.  Being preganant seemed to somewhat stabilize my mood swings.  That was all until memories of my childhood came swinging back in full motion, but again, thats a story all in it self, that I will get back too later.  I eneded up seaking day treatment for my mental health when I was 8 mo. prego with my son.  I got adjusted somewhat and prepared to take on the role of being a mother. Well I had my son and we had a family, everything was good for a little while.  But after I had my son My harmones did something crazy and it was like I was in a constant state of mania.  I spent every sent my hands got a hold of.  In the month of October 2001 I gotten 10 credit cards and had them all charged up within a month and a half!  Jeff got laid off his job, and I was making peanuts.  We ended up having to move in with his parents.  We stayed  there for 3 months and got some money together.  We moved into this shitty apartment complex on the North End of Flint.  Then less than 6 mo. later I was prego again with my daughter.  This time I was like oh-shit!  we were so broke as it was.  Well in November 2002 Taylee Fiona Rae was born.    We needed to move again, but how? Our credit was screwd.  Well In September of 2003 My mother in law helped us buy a home in the Argentine Linden area.  Which is wonderful.  There are tons of lakes, very low crime rate, and people take care of things out here.    So that brings us to the present.  This is where I am at in Michigan.

      After I had my son I had a brief bout with post-partum depression.  I was mostly depressed because I went from being 13olbs.  Before getting prego, to an astonishing, and sickening 280lbs. I felt like a freak, and I also was having a hard time adjusting to all the changes in my life.  I mean I moved, graduated highschool, married, and birthed a child via c-section in a relatively brief period of time I was very depressed.    I had received a scholarship from my nite school to go to the Detroit College of Business and getting prego and having a kid tossed that out the window. I felt crapy.  Like a massive failure.  This worsened after my husband had gotten laid off and we were forced to move in with my in-laws at the end of our lease.  Seth was 7 mo. I was well on my way to loing my weight, but moving into his moms house sent me into a further depression of hopelessness that I eventually began to cure with alchol, drugs and parties at night when my husband returned from his temp job which did not even earn half of what he was making before, I had a job at a dollar store making just a little less than what he was.    Then they sent me a credit card in the mail.  I found that shopping was very theraputic for depression.  I had gotten 12 credit cards within a month and had them all maxed within 3 months and lost my job within a month of that.  I was guilty of affairs, which yes, i have since came clean about.  I was doing whatever it took to feel good and hang on to it.  I was angry, and I unfortunately missed a lot of firsts for my son.  but at the time I was so caught up in trying to hold onto my quickly vanishing youth, I did not forsee the consequences of my actions.  I regret so much now.  My son is such an awesome human being.  My daughter too. They rock.  I am glad that period passed, but as you will learn it returned after my daughters birth.

        urlLink        Your Seduction Stye: "Sex Pot"  Tradionally known as a "siren", "rake", or "femme fatale." You exude sensuality.   And while your sexiness is part of what makes you an incredible seducer...   Your ability to make others feel sexy is what really makes your seduction skills shine.     Most people don't feel attractive or desired enough - a need which you tap into.   You have the ultimate sex appeal, and getting attention from you is a total self esteem boost.   Your confidence is contagious, and you help others unleash their own sexuality.     Your sex pot seduction skills are so intoxicating that you can get away with... well, almost murder.   Lovers feel like your sensuality is in your blood, so it's only natural if you flirt a little.   And if you stray, that might be okay as well - as long as you make your lover still feel hot.     urlLink   What Kind of Seducer Are You?       urlLink More Great Quizzes from Quiz Diva

      I am sick of the untrusting people in the world.  The untrusting ones are usually the ones who fuck you over for trusting them and their own guilty conscience makes them paranoid to trust anyone else.  It's like they automatically assume everyone is as bad as they are.    Why can't people just put all their cards on the table?  It's so stupid.    One day I fear becomming a hermit, because I am at a point in my life where my social interations leave a lot to be desired.  But some of that is my own fault.  I am so closed to people I meet, I live in the now, I dont have expectations for anything more than aquantances, and I really don't apply the effort it takes to sustain any kind of long-lasting friendship.  I mean once bitten twice shy if you know what I mean.    Sometimes I unilaterally hate the world.  Manically Yours, ~Tiffany

      EVeryone is writting about Captain Kangaroo In Their journals, as though it were some great and tragic loss.  To me, Captain Kangaroo is a Pee-Wee Herman that never got caught with his pants down.  Infact Captain Kangaroo was about as crappy of a show as pee-wee's playhouse.  I remember my grandam turning it on Captain Kangaroo and Romper Room when I was a kid, and it was dumb and insulting even at that early age.  Don't get me wrong I am sad when anyone dies but people are acting like Captain Kangaroo was a God.  It's pretty sad that in America people give more of shit about a caracter on tv then whether or not they vote.  Manically Yours, ~Tiffany  P.S. VOTE FOR DEAN!

      The summer brings such wonderful things.  Everything is good! The smells, the tastes, the view, the sex.  It's all better in the Summer.    I remember one summer, it was my birthday and I went to the bar and drank sex on the beach all night.  I danced, I did some karoke, smoked a joint, met a cute guy with a nice car and went to the beach at 2:30am and went skinny dipping, and had the most incredible as-the-sun-was-rising-sex-on-the-beach that I could have ever imagined.  Audio slave was in the back groung humming out like a stone.  It was one of the best summers/birthdays ever.

      I  love  the ocean, and anything that has to do with marine life, lakes, and lighthouses.  This summer around my 24th Birthday I am planning a road trip to the western side of my state (Michigan) to tour all the great lighthouses.  I love the idea of checking out these beauties up close an personal.  I mean I have been to Grand Haven and saw my first lighthouse there.  For those of you who don't know about Grand Haven, just watch any of the American Pie movies, they were all shot there.  Its absolutely gorgeous out there.  Infact, the first lighthouse I had ever seen was the same one that  appeared in the first AMerican Pie movie.    I still have not figured out what it is I find so attractive about lighthouses.  Maybe it's the idea of the guiding light, or the legends and stories centered around them.  I just know I do love them.

Of course I am merely telling you about what has already been a great source of boredom already on this site.  I wish It were summer.   Ideas are always new and freah in the summer.  I guess I will just try to stick it out til then forgive me if I become redundant and boring, I will try to be interesting despite my lack of inspiration.

      I fear Bush may get re-elected- which ultimately means more death, destruction, and poor ecnomical choices.  Bush sets off the angry man in my head that snaps 2 by 4's on impulse.  Bush is the reason why the economy has literally bottomed out, now he wants to send a man to mars.  I say sure we can afford that, It's not like we have spent trillions of dollars ona war in the middle east or anything.    What is wrong with the world!?  Can't they see that Bush is the Poster CHild for the destruction of everything that this country was originally founded on.  If Bush gets re-elected I can guarentee his tactics in the middle east will get more ridgid and hostile.  I can guarentee he will offer billion of dollars in tax cuts that will ultimately kill educational spending and government assisted programs for the minorities. I can also guesss that abortion will become completely illegal and welfare will be ultimately cut, and sex education wil;l be abolished from schools, and parents will be held accountiable for their under-educated teens becoming infected with HIV.  This is the world that Bush wants to create.  Stop him, before he destroys us.

      Well Sorry For not Posting All Day But yesterday shortly after I updated, My monitor blew up, Literally.  Thank god my parents are tech junkies, and had a few extra lying around.  Being without internet all day has made me realize how much I take it for granted!  But now I have a monitor, and I am not without my main source of entertainment.  I know, I sound like a pathetic computer geek with no life, but me being bi-polar, this keeps me out of trouble.   Last night I went out, and I didn't take it to extremes I even got in before midnight.  I was proud of myself, It was a mighty conquest over my manic impulses!  Well thats all that my redunt proto type style writting will allow for now, Hopefully my next post will be a better read.  Manically Yours, ~Tiffany

I really wish I would have worked out today! Oh well. Tomorrow Is another day.  On a more personal note,  I have got to say something to you ass riders yet again!  People who like to attach themselves to the rear of my car with their car will be shot on impact!  I am so tired of unorganized, lazy people waiting until the last possible second to leave for where ever they are going and riding my ass! When I am already doing 5-10 over in a school zone to appease them, they still insist in becoming bunk mates with my license plate.  Get Off My ASS!   What is worse is when you are getting your ass rode by "rudy the redneck in the big red truck"  You take your foot of the gas petal and you drop your speed slowly, hoping that they may get the point and go around- but instead they feel the need to punish you for not recognizing you are on "their" road by flashing their brites and honking their horn!  To this I reply with my hazard lights and a snail crawl.  SO GET THE F### OF MY ASS!  Manically Yours, ~Tiffany

        You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming.  Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I get a lot of e-mails written by bi-polar people desperately seeking the secret of my sanity.   I ask myself.................  Do people really think I am sane?    I don't think I am sane, I think I am a neurotic, hypo-maniac, nympho, obnoxious, impulsive, and completely twisted.  So I dove deeper into the question that I was being presented with.  What is it about my internet persona that comes off relatively sane?  ANd I figured it out!  They must thinkI am joking? Or Maybe they think That I am hyping up the intensity of a lunatic to "sell" my posts?  Well let me clarify all the rumors and/or suspicions.  I am a genuine bi-polar person.  I don't take any meds, nor do I see a threapist for fear of being put on meds.  If I at any time come off remotely sane, I assure you it is in error, Because I am completely fucking nuts, and proud.    The question you should have asked me is What is the secret of getting through your(as in mine) hard life?  In which, I would have replied:  Being completely and utterly fucking insane!

      There is not one thing more irritating than having to tell perpetually stupid people the same thing over and over.  The children next door are two of the most abnoxious, ignorant, under-supervised products of random imbreeding I have ever met.  So far CPS has been called out to their house 9 or 10 times (not by me.)  I am wondering how these awful parents, whom let their daughter ( I am guessing she is in between 6-8 years old) Swing a metal snow shovel around my trailor windows and car. And allow their 4-5 year old to play in the street, and ride the bike alone.  They throw things at my house, they scream for help like someone is kidnapping them, and when you go to check on them, nothing is wrong except the can't tie their shoe.  Parents who allow this kind of shit to happen are hideous!  If you can't handle the responsibility of children, give them to some who can!  ~Tiffany

      It is 3:13 am, I have spent all night customizing and searching for content for my site.  I need to go to unky moods, i forgot, opps.  Well In any event, I am very proud of my outcome.  Some of my updates include a guest book, I got rid of the forum (posting problems), added comments, personalized the color scheme (this took forever), and soon to come I will be transferring all of my frequent readers links to this site.  On another note today, well technically yesterday was my son's 3rd birthday, the poor kid came down with the flu and spent most of the day on the couch.  I know he aint feeling good when all he wants to do is lie down, that just isn't right!  Then my daughter came down with it too!  Its just a 24 hour bug so we will be having his party today.  Finances could be better but we are getting by.  And despite my hypomania I have stuck top the budget and put the bills first.  I have been home nearly every night for the past 2 weeks, which is good for me.  Well I am extremely tired, and incoherently boring at this point, so I will let you go.

      I am aggrivated as hell though.  I just am sick of bills and I keep trying to think of a way to get ahead and It is near impossible.  I am sick of living paycheck, to paycheck-  I mean our budget is so tight, its an effort to buy for birthdays, and CHristmas is near impossible.  WHich is why I am thinking about becomming a Johava's Witness-  Then I will not feel so guilty about not having holidays/birthdays.  (I could never really do that, but it's a preassure release opt out option that surfaces in my panic at times.)  In any event My sons birthday is on the 17th.  I am going to buy him a birthday present even if I have to go without eating for a few days!  GRR.......

      I am sick of being sick!    I am drained,  Yesterday I thought that I had Appendicitis-but I don't, well at least I think.    I am tired of winter.  Its cold and dreary, and snow is everywhere.  I just hope I can tough it out for the next couple of months.  If I can make it to March I will be ok.  March is sometimes still yucky, but at least there is a light at the end of the tunnel in March.  We do not have to far to go.  Its already half way through January and February is a short month, so I think we will be ok.  But in any event. Does anyone have a good cold remedy?  Post it on my forum down below.  Love ya, sorry to be so boring-  I am putting out quite the effort just to breathe.  Plus I am PMSing- SO not a good mix.  P.s. the house is still in relatively good shape, from when I cleaned it last.

      Do you ever just wander in thought and come to a screeching holt when you are reminded of your own mortality.  Lately I have been thinking a lot about death in a sort of paranoid destructive way.  I usually get like this in the winter.  I keep wondering if I have obtained cancer, or some other life threatening illness.  I keep picturing what it would be like for my kids if I were to die young.  I keep picturing what kind of world they would have to deal with.  I also keep picturing all those I have seen suffer for years before their death.  It sucks, and it panics me beyond beleif.  It panics me soo much I am scared to go to the doctor, because I am afraid of the possibility of bad news.    Whats worse is I keep thinking if I am this panicked and worried now at 23, what will I be like 10 years from now?  I really am considering filling for SSI for my bi-polar so I can get medicated.  I think that this would help.  I am begenning to wonder if my paranoia of death is in someway related toa gradoise dellusion.  Grrr. ~Tiffany

      what is it about crapy weather that reminds you how bad life sucks sometimes?  Today I managed to paint an awesome logo for my new band name "Designed 2 Deceive"  You might say that this is a positive.......  but................yes, of course there is a but...................................  I have not got any musicians.  ::::::::::::SHAMELESS PLUG IN:::::::::::::: Are you a musician? Can you play more than power cords? Have you long since surpassed unrealistically skittish stage fear?  and most importantly..... Have you gone through puberty?  Yes?  Well I have a job for you!  E-mail me at psuedosane1980@aol.com or @yahoo.com. Please write musician and your instrument in the subject line. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  So back to my incessant dribble.  I am in love. I am in love with forbidden fruit.  I feel as though I am doomed to these feelings for eternity.    I hate love, it is such a reched device of mass munipulation.  Love is constantly dong the opposite of what you should be doing and not finding out how stupid you were until you have lost everything!  Well except the love for your children- that is far different.  Well Bah-humbug!  ~Tiffany

      I just watched the Virgin Suicides today, and I am completely enthralled with it.  It is funny to watch a movie of tradgedy and come away feeling good.  The movie reminded me of the prison that was my life as a teenager.  My parents were one of two things (or both) 1. They were selfish and lazy and didn't allow us to participate in real world activities because the inconvenience and aggravation it caused them, and/or 2. They were obnoxiously paranoid we would decend down the same treacherous paths that they have spent a great deal of their lives striding upon.  Either or, my life existed in secret, and I have found it very difficult in my new adult relationships not to live a "double life" as I did when I was young.  I remember being so conflicted and suffocated as a teenager, I tried to kill myself a few times.  I felt like I couldn't be me, I would never be honest again, and all the other things that amount to guilt and a lack luster desire to live in the end.  One triumphant day I rebelled. This led to a pattern of rebellion-that literally saved my life.  My biggest strength has been never accepting things for what they are, an insistence to change what cannot be changed has given me drive to push on in some of my darkest hours.  This, however is also one of my greatest weaknesses, because it often times leads to a great disappointment.  But when I was a teenager and living at home, and my father, embarrassed about how his own life turned out continuously tried to talk me out of my own self-worth, I fought back.   I did not allow him to steal what my heart and my mind grasped on to for dear life. My soul.    I walked away from that movie feeling good because I did not sucome to the tradgedy that their (the girls in the movie) weakness had assigned them to.

      That show is making it trendy to have no personality!  Right Now this wholesom family tv show has this young 20 stripper telling her mother who was a dancer also her devious little secret-  and suprise (not really) but she is prostituting too!  WHat the FUck!?!??!?!?!??!?!?!??!?!  I am so aggrivated.  Why are there so many empty people in the world.  They have nothing past the face value if you know what I  mean.  I would like to think that i am a multi faceted personality.  I have all those "old fashioned" things like self-respect, responsibility, a sense of humor, Pride, dignity, and independance, and most of all Morals.  And I am no "goody-goddy" by far so it's not an issue about coolness.  I am well liked, and have had no run-ins with the cops, I have attitude and spunk, but I know when to sit back and when to stand up for whats right.  I guess I do not understand people's complete lack of ability to see themselves and the world of regret that they creating by not thinking about how what they are doing now is going to forever change what they can be tomorrow.  I guess you just try to cope.

      Well today was an adventure in why I need meds.  I woke up at noon, rushed around to get out the door and took the kids to the mall- I never sleep in that late so I was running atround like a mad man and missed my morind and afternoon dose- and low and behold by 4pm I was a nervous wreck.  I got home and took my meds and now I am in the process of defragging.  I think I am going to go play pool tonite and try to shake this nervous/anxious feeling.  Ya I know- I am getting hopelessly boring, but My muse is on vacation.  LOL  Manically Yours, ~Tiffany

      I was watching Ellen today and was very happy to see william dung one of the New American Idol rejects.  For thos of you who don't remember, he is the Asian guy who did Ricky Martin's "She Bangs."  I thought he looked sort of down-syndromish (new word, like? :D) but I am not sure its hard to tell.  He is a sweet kid and he really symbolizes hope and I also like the fact that despite his not so flattering renditions of latin boom music, he is fun to listen too.  But I think it's his spirit that is alluring.  I also find justice in the fact that he was rejected in American Idol auditions and is now becoming an American idol anyway- and best of all, on his own merit-not the super dubed studio recorded pre fab lyrics that American Idol finds a puppet to perform.  Kudos.  Manically Yours, ~Tiffany

      I was admitted to the nut house on Tuesday (last) and I just got out a few hours ago. I had an extreme manic episode that caused me to become violently angry and I needed to go in and get help.  I was concerned that if I did not get this thing under control that I would eventually, in time, possibly hurt my children.  Now I am on meds- and guess what they are actually working without the zombie side effects.  They got me on Neurotin (anti-manic mood stabalizer), Remeron (anti-depressant), and buspar (anti-anxiety).  Along with my treatment I received a new diagnoses as well.  So as it turns out I have Borderline Personality Dissorder along with Bi-polar extended mania.  Yay!  But the good news is, that meds will keep most of this under control, the rest, however, is on me.  Well thats it for now, I am tired and on a days scheduel once again so I will update later.

It's weird how shit happens sometimes.  You get what you asked for and wish you hadn't afterwords cause you know you will never be able to duplicate the experience again.

      What the fuck is wrong with the Jackson's?  It wasn't enough when the media shoves mothfulls of Michaels child molestation case, but now we are forced to indulge Janet as she decides that all the world needs an introduction to how to be an intention starved jealous sibling for all the wrong reasons.  What the hell was she thinking?  I mean I am not a prude, nor do I consider myself a conservative by any means (i.e this site) But the superbowl is an American tradition.  Ministers, priests, family men, family woman, people old and young alike buy tickets or watch this nationally televised game every year.  The Super Bowl is not the place to get naked to launch dropping or non-existing record sales.   But that is not as bad as it gets!  Poor Justin Timberlake was completely blindsided, you can tell by his reaction on stage, and his statement!  I dont like Justin's music, but Janet's stunt could cost him his career!  Then think about those who buy tickets to the superbowl next year!  I can guarentee that less families will be there!    The Jackson family would be more useful if sent to another planet.  Cause God knows they aren't living on this one!  Manically Yours, ~Tiffany  PUBLIC SERVICE ANOUNCEMENT FOR SUICIDAL TEENS:     AT LEAST YOUR NOT THE JACKSON'S!

      I consider myself kind of empty in the feeling department.  It's not that I do not feel anything its just that a lot of my life has been filled with depression, heart ache, self-esteem issues, and struggle and anxiety.  Because of this, I have sort of made a conscious decision to not give a fuck.  Don't get me wrong I have passion for certain things, but love dosen't seem to be one of them since my kids were born.   I have nver felt love greater than my love for my children- shit I am not so sure it even exists.    I guess at some point you just learn not to expect so much.  It's almost like a self-defense mechanism.  Once you have so much shit taken from you, you learn to not care when it keeps getting taken from you in order to survive.  I am being really depressing!  I am sorry.  SOmetimes the lack-luster glow from the gleem in the deceivers eye just takes hold and shows you the awful soul inside.  Manically Yours, ~Tiffany

      I am in a quite rather good desposition this afternoon.  I have no real reason to be, but I excercised started taking diet life, and a multi-vitamin.  I also changed ISP's.  America Online these days is just grossly overpriced for the crapy service you get.  I mean Yes, they have lots of neat features (expressions, music, alerts, schedueling, blah blah blah)  But how great are they when they only offer three dial up numbers for your area, and none of them work?  Or you could go the even more grossly overpriced route, call up your local cable company pay them 30-60 for a cable modem which guarentees a connection, but then pay aol standard member ship and "only 1.95 more" for access to all their broadband features-which dosent happenb automatically just because you have a cable connection by the way!  Then there is the bi- yearly updates, and with each one of them they use increasingly more drive space and memory forcing your computer into extinction! KISS MY ASS AOL!

      Tomorrow is April Fool's day.  Normally i would expect snow.  It seems like every year in Michigan Mother Nature seems to think it would be nice to dump us with one final snow shower on April 1st.  But I have faith that this year things will be different.  Although, some sunshine would be nice, and overdue, I am happy with the moderate temperatures that bring hope to Summers verge.    I love the summer.  It's beauty, its spirit, it's energy they all suduce me, and bring out the most vulnerable and naieve traits I posess.  Its 3 months of sheer joy, happiness, and complete release, not to mention my libido soars.  Speaking of which I have passed my sexual dry spell. Yay!  But in any event it's time for me to write for my shrink.  He has me journaling.  But it seems so bland because I really am not me for that journal.  I don't trust the system is why.  I have seen too much shit exposed that was always promised to confidentiality.  I trust the people on the net more than I do someone I can touch.  At least here I am fiction, people dont see me as real or tangible, they see this as entertainment and dribble.  But to a shrink the appropriateness of my being is under scrutiny.  I guess I am being rediculous  and a ver bad speller(sorry)  But I must go now.  Manically Yours, Tiffany

      I was driving home last night around 9 pm from an incredily long and tiring day. The children, who were screaming and crying from fatigue, finally clunked out in the backseat.  I thought, peace at last! Wrong! US-23 was chok-full of retarded "rudy-the-redneck-in-the-big-red-truck" types, who were speading and riding people's rears, mine was not excluded.  So instead of throwing myself in some insane bout of flaming road rage I decided to instead let my mind wander in a Jan Brady sort of schitzophrenic way.  My mind went from aggrivation, to complete twisted satisfaction as I imagined the idiotic drivers crashing into the median because of their carelessness and bursting into slow killing flames!  Wicked, I know, but relaxing. Then this completely random thought crossed my mind:  I wonder if statistically more people get in car accidents who have laser cop detectors than not?

      I hate the last few weeks of winter.  It is filled with such cruelty.  Swiftly allowing you to feel teasing rays of warmth, but in the same week reminding you of winter's bitter cold.  I am so un-motivated, and feeling so restless.  I have this overwhelming urge just to get in my car and drive.  I would never run-away but it is extremely tempting.  Just to get away, find some excitement and try to escape the confines of loneliness that has imprisoned me.  I am definitely being over dramatic, but that is the illness right?  It's hard to know what is real and what is imagined anymore.  All the lines seem to have ran together to produce some merky grey mess.  I am trying to sort through the fragments that drunkenness and short term memory has left of my life.  All I have is nothing to be proud of.  I mean I am no sort of "alcholic"  I only drink socially, but my weakness is knowing when to stop. Impulse control.  Lack of impulse control has turned my life upside down at times.  Tomorrow is a different day, I know if I can get by 'til summer is here, I will be renewed and restored.

      My mom just called me today and she received some test results from some blood work she had done.  It turns out she has a low thyroid condition, the doctors said it was one of the worst case scenarios they had ever seen.    How does this tie in with me?  Well as it turns out, the symptoms of bi polar and low thyroid are almost identical, right down to hearing and seeing things.  There are also a lot of physical symptoms that I experience.  Such as the inability to loose weight despite how good I eat or how active i am.    So this is good news, I go and get tested and get on the artificial harmone, and I might be able to shed these last 20 lbs. I have been wanting to get rid of.  Well I got to go.  TTYL.

      I am at that place where I hate to be.  Void of passion, ideas, or a general sense of well-being.  I am not depressed, nor manic.  I am just floating.  Unable to position myself in life in any definite way.  Kinda like being in a coma.  You know whats going on around you, but you are unable to react to the stimuli.  I  would almost rather be depressed than this.  Being like this is like someone very special to you cooking you your most favorite meal in the most perfect ways, but as you chew on it, it's void of taste and you lack the imagination to even remember what the taste is.  It's like wandering with no apparent destination.  It will pass it usually does.

      This is one of the White Stripes albums that I just picked up and its absolutely great.  I have one song in particular that I have been running through my mind repeatedly  Its sung by meg here are the lyrics (I just have to share this for some compelling reason that I am not yet aware of.)  In The Cold, Cold, Night.  I saw you standing in the corner On the edgeof a burning light I saw you standing in the corner Come to me again, in the cold, cold night  You make me feel a little older, Like a full grown woman might But when you're gone I grow colder, Come to me again in the cold, cold night  I see you walking by my front door I hear the creaking of the kitchen floor I don't care what people say I'm going to love you, anyway Come to me again in the cold, cold night  I can't stand it any longer I need the fuel to make my fire bright So don't fight it any longer Come to me again, in the cold, cold night  And I know you feel it too, When my skin turns into glue, You will know that it's warm inside And you'll come run to me, In the cold, cold night.

      Today I got yet another of my hate-mails from our neurotically christian audience.  (yes I have a neurotic christian audience who from time to time writes me sorid hate mail on what a sinner I am.)  But this was funny  THis is how it looked word for word, format to format:  To Whom it may COnCern-Manically Yours or Tiffany: I find your site an abomination to everything I have ever been tsught in mi liyfe.  People like u r the reason why we are vastly approuching judgement day.  How do I axplain things on your web page to my children?  Do you have no sense of repondability to protect thjat whic is sacred? As an avid follower of GOd I can state with utmost certainly that he would forgive your sins so long as you sease and desease today.  There is always plente of time to save your soul.  Mary  ______________________________________ WELL HERE IS MY RESPONSE SINCE I KNOW YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAN READ MY SITE  1. School is for the religously insane too. 2. If you can't spell it don't say it. 3. I do not think that God assigned you the job of judging others, but to each is there own. 4. You do not "explain" my site to your children.  You supervise them, and shelter them from things that you do not wish for them to see. And if by chance the do stumble upon it anyway- you tell them that people go through dofferent things in life that make them who they are, and you dont always have to agree with other people's choices. 5. You don't ask people you loathe for parenting advice. 6. My sense of responsibility has been expended on doing what I need to do for myself. 7. As an advocate for justice for all I am sure God would forgive you for misrepresenting him, and judging those that you are not worthy to judge.

      Toilet humor does not really entertain me the same way it did when I was kid, but never-the-less I was picturing my life as my friend (gasping for air) told this horrifying tale of my final contribution to Society.  See, I am a gaseous person- I HAVE to eat beano in order not to be vile.  (Those embarassing tabooed truths!)  But in any event I was sitting in my friends room when all the sudden they break out in this visual, speaking in a relatively elderly seeming voice they go on to express this to-be dialougue.  "Honey...", I say in this elderly on-my-death-bed-voice "Yes" The older version of my friend. "Come here honey" me again. "What you need, glass a water, footrub?" friend in the mocking elder voice.  Then a big fart  and me croaking.  My friends are twisted individuals.

      I hate to use public forums to insult or bitch about people who drive me completely insane, but I will make an exception for my Arch Nemesis "Angie."  This woman is, in my opinion, the definition of how to got to Hell when you die.  Let me give you a summary of the wonderful world of Angela Middleton:  She met her first husband when she was 16, insisted on getting married and finally willed it so when she was 17, and her first kid at 17(she was almost 18).  Not all together abnormal.  Then she insisted on having another child and did diet pills and smoked the whole time she was prego.  That child I believe has Fetal alchol affect due to his numerous behavioral problems. (poor kid is so misguided).  Well the man she married was in the military and was shipped off to Korea for a year, so she lived with her parents the whole year and managed to obtain numerous credit accounts and charge them all up with his power of attorney, and better yet had nothing to show for it when he returned home.  She also sold a vast majority of his possesions that were worth any value.  Then he finds a coke straw in the car that they had on base.  Coke the narcotic not the beverage.  And she is also having numerous affairs, only to come home and yell and scream to him, and display verbal and physical violence in front of her 3 year old daughter.  Well they seperated and not too long after that she was knocked up by a drug attic cook at a coney island style reteraunt that she had been seeing before they were even seperated.  In a desperate attempt to not have an illigitamate child she tried to reconcile with her husband and have sex with him so she could insist that he got her pregnant not the looser cook.  Well this did not fly the were divorced and as all white trash will do, she sighned up for welfare took the marital car and never paid, as she was supposed to.  Obtained a credit for a rental in his name and then didn't pay her lot rent and got a judgement issued against him on his credit- without his knowlege.  Moved in with her fiance for the moment and tried to get the little boy to call him daddy as opposed to her ex.  Well things were somewhat peacful til her ex got a new girlfriend and moved her(2 years after the fact)  Thats when all the hell began.  She insisted the two were going to pay so she took out personal protection orders claiming the girlfriend was in the Gambino Crime Family and took out a contract on her life.  And he supposedly threatened her life.  took his kids away for three months, until the courts forced her to allow him to see his kids again.  Things were ok again, until Floridathe father was going to do a 3 month duty for the USAF in Tampa, and wanted the children for 2 weeks.  Well as soon as he picked up the children they were acting strangely, depressed, withdrawn.  Then they started acting out first it was just normal kid stuff.  arguing, fighting with each other, not really a big deal.  But the it escalated to more dangerous behaviors that were at times life-threatening.  They attempted to send the kids home at 2 weeks, she refused.  4 weeks, she refused.  6 weeks, she refused.  2 days lated the children's behavior just became explosive so he calls her and refuses to take no for an answer.  Well in the process the girl had fell on the concrete while rollerblading and also received a spanking which subsequently left a hand print bruise on her butt.  So she presses charges and in the long run they were dismissed but through all the court proceedings they discovered that ANgie was an active drug abuser, and an alcholic, she was anerexic.  She had been hospitalized in the mental ward for several different things, depression, sucide attempts, ect. Apparently before the kids came to Florida she had pulled a gun out in front of her fiance and the children and her fiance had to lock her in the basement until the police arrived.  Well despit the charges being dismissed she still illegally witheld her ex's visitation.  So he had to take her to court for show cause.  In fear of possible jail time for contempt or forced restitution payments she agreed to sign a parenting time order. Her ex finally had some control over the situation.  But after that it was so dysfunctional in her home.  She has people she meets on the internet comming over all hours of the night to have sex and party while the kids are trying to sleep.  She ended up marrying some guy in jail for vehicular homicide while intoxicated.  He dosent get out til 2008.  She somehow managed to get pregnant again even though the state of Michigan does not allow congical visits.  that child was born this March past.  She is also being secretive about something that happened to the ex's son.  But FIA is investigating that.  She still drinks.   Constantly asking her parents for money.  This woman lives in a shit-hole trailor in a shit-hole park (real white trash-esque) the kids stay with her parents most of the time.   She makes 89.00 a week on his 2, 50.00 a week on the third kid , and probably at least 50.00 a week on the new one.  She dosen't give a dime to her parents. She works as a waitress. So she makes 756.00 in child support alone.  thats like two pay checks for me!  And lets say she works 30 hours a week even though she claims more than that at a reduced wage of 2.75 an hour because she is a waitress plus 20.00 a night in tips which is more than feasable. that gross comes to 202.00 a week- and I am grossly under-estimating.  SO thats another 808.00.  Plus she is always asking her parents for money to pay her bills, and the kids eat and sleep at the grandparents without charge to her. So After her 300.00 a month rental payment her 50.00 dollar a month phone bill, her 200.00 a month consumers plus the very few groceries she has to buy where is the money going?  I don't think I need to explain why she aggravated me so much.

      Inspiration.   Today I was compelled by, the most likely and cleache of places, The Oprah Show.  It was a chutzpa (hood-spa) award show.  These woman came on and shared the stories about triumph over defeat.  But that in itself was not the most inspiring thing to me.  The moment of complete and utter admiration came from the simple statement "You are in control of your own life, you can be what ever you are willing to work hard enough to be."  I was taught this addage in similar phrasings most of my life, despite my parents numerous disfunctions.  But I suppose it was inspiring because today I really feel "in-a-rut-ish"    I am comming down with my Daughter's flu and I am sure that this has a great deal to do with my inner-reflective state.  Simply because I have got no choice but to slow down.  But in any event, I guess what I am getting at is, I have a renewed since of vitality, and new sense of hope to triumph over some of my bitterly tragic circumstances, instead of feeling sorry for myself.  I will go on more about this soon on the off ramp ( http://manicdigestofframp.blogspot.com )  I hope from what I am planning to post on the Off Ramp in the Next Couple weeks will do more to make people understand that it can always be worse, and no matter how the dime falls, it's ultimately up to you when it comes to which way your life goes.  Manically Yours, Tiffany

      I seldom go out and do anything besides the bar.  But, Saturday, on a whim, decided to go to Cinema 10 (owned by National Amusements, whom also owns the infamous ShowCase Cinemas.)    I was still quite full from the gut-busting "feast" meal I had at Red Lobster's, so I decided to just buy a bottle of water from concessions, fearing that pop would make me feel more bloated than I already was.  So the chipper clerk dressed in a gawdy visor, masked with a pimple ridden face gets my water, and goes through the whole mandatory pitch to sell me gobstoppers and m&m's.  I told him just the water (just a 16 oz. bottle of Aquafina) and he comes back and says "3.18"  I freaked out and said "What the time?"   He goes on to say no you owe me 3 dollars and 18 cents.  To this I reply "What the Fuck? FOR WATER!?!?" , "Blow ME, It better be made of Gold For # fucking Dollars and 18 goddamn cents!"  Yes-very very immature and absurd, but I could not help it! I was in complete shock.    Minnimum wage in this state is only $5.50  A bottle of 20 oz. Aquafina at the gas station is no more than $1.20, at the grocery store it's less than a buck.  I mean I know most things at the cinema are over priced, and as much as that bugs me to no end, I still expect it.  But water? Especially when there are drinking fountains all around?  It will be a cold day in hell when I pay more than half of minimum wage for the worlds most abundant resource!  Manically Yours, Tiffany   P.S. Help drive prices down! Boycott Over Priced Concession Stands!  Bring a big bad filled with cheap goddies from your favorite grocerie store or do the drive in.

      I read this blog called everybody poops ( it's linked on the right under "fav blogs".)  It's a good blog, it makes me really think about what is important to me.  THe author is very intelligent and weel read on her topics of interest.  I still read her blog despite our little tif over veganism activists. But not everyone will agree on the same things.  So I guess I feel the need to formerly state what i am about.  Because I really dont fit in any label I tend to have many problems.    I see the view points from all sides and refuse to back down on the premiss of loyalty alone.  I can't really call myself a feminist, because I really don't know anything about feminism, and the stuff I have read I really can't say I agree with.  I can't stand anyone without backbone female or male alike.  I don't think women should be subserviant to men anymore than I think men should be subserviant to woman.  I think individfuals should be judged individually not as a group whether that be sex, race, religon, or sexual prefrence.  I think that there is a place in the world for all people.  The meat eaters, the vegans, the democrats and republicans, the blacks and the whites and all other racial divisions, for feminist, and men, for the rich and the poor, the gay and the straight, the insane and the normal.    If I were to protest about anything, it would not be centered around a special interest, but instead a broad interest, and that would be the ultimate right to choose in which way we live our lives.  Even mass murderer's have a choice of whether or not to kill.  I may hate loath and be disgusted by what they do but it is their choice and there are consequences for their choice.  I eat meat, I am the center of my universe (not my cunt  see everybody poops )  I am not a goddess, but I am not a worthless wench.  I have balance in my life when it comes to my opinions.  I choose not to be overly radical on anything because abusing my rights taskes away from other people's rights.  We can all be good strong people without taking it to extremes.  Instead of protesting against the man as a feminist.  Why not set up classes to educate women about their historical acomplishments, and work towards reversing the self esteem damage that some but not all men have caused?    Instead of being vegan and throwing buckets of red [paint on people sporting furs, and demonstrating against hunters and manufacturers, why not boycott the product, and feel satisfied with the fact that when you choose not to eat or wear meat thats one less cow that will be butchered.    Why is it all organizations think and feel the world would be better if everyone did the same as them.    But thats just my take on something that I am sure is very complex.  I admire those who stand up for what the feel strongly about, but I quickly loose that respect when they infrige on others rights to get their points across.

      I can't believe that it has been 10 years since the great Seattle sound invasion.  Has it really been that long?  I remember jeering through the akwardness of puberty with the teen angst ballads of Nirvana and Pearl Jam, Better than Ezra, Sponge, Jane's Addiction, and all the hippe rock was also comming back full throtle.  My peers and I would wander through the hallways of school stoned and/or drunk, with pants that had bigger leg bottoms than all the waste measurements in the NFL combined.  The girls were rowdy, the boys were synical.  We wrote poetry, and formed bands.  We drove around in crapy cars, but not because we were broke teenagers, but because we were trying to take a stand against the mainstream, and what was socially acceptable.  We stretched the boundries in our schools.  We cussed in class, and told the teachers when they were wrong without flenching.   During My generation we went from thinking politely, to thinking truthfully.  We squelched the remnants of unearned respect.  We made authority respect our rights.  We fought back against those who thought somehow that they held seniority in life, and didn't have to give to get.  AT least thats the way I seen it.   But now.....  Its went from "with cause" to "in vain".  The youth sickens me these days.  They expect what we fought so hard to dispell.  They wear skater gear for fasion not because they are rebelling against the mainstream.  They use their teen angst to violate laws and be blantantly-without-cause-disrespectful.  I hurts me to no end that all the "causes" I felt so strongly about are nothing more than relics in my mind now.    It really makes me feel old.  All that music that was so powerfully moving is destined to become elevator music ligthly playing in the background while I play bingo at the retirement home.  It's a depressing thought.

      Yesterday I went to my fathers house.  We had yet another falling out, about the same thing that we always have fallout about anymore.  My uncle did things to me as a child of a perverted nature.  I did not start to recall these events until I was pregnant with my first child.  I had completely blocked them out all these years (which is fairly common from what I have been told)  My grandmother enabled the entire situation.  My whole family hates me for saying these things.  They have convinced themselves that somehow because of my bi-polar that I have concocted these stories from my illness, and they are not really true.  I wish that were true.  I wish I could say I am nuts.  I wish I could say that because then I could get on a pill that would make these nasty images flee from my mind.  I am losing everything.   I have lost my dignity, my pride, my extended family, my credibility (because of their insistence in finding a reason not to believe me), I am loosing my mind.  I have now lost my father.  Its not like he hates me.  And he dosent understand my dissmissal of him.  To me it is obvious.  If you can choose anyone over your child on something as serious as this, that in itself is a problem.  But to dig deeper.  Lets pretend that isn't the issue.  If he can live in this denial about what happened to me, if he can dismiss my allagation and be so ballsy to have a 15 min conversation with him within ear shoot of me while I am over visiting and my kids are running about-If he can talk to that man and pretend like nothing happened- I am left to assume one of two things for the safety of my children and my sanity:  1. He was molested as a child and/or mentally abused to the point to not question this form of brutality and continue to respect his family despite what laws they break.    2. He literally dosen't believe me, and therefore ignores the seriousness of the problem and will remain wreckless in his dealings with me and my children.  If either of these are true my father, as much as it pains me to say this, He is not appropriate to be around me in my fragile state of mind.  I mean I just got out of the hospital in Feb.  And he is not appropriate to be around my children.  If something wee to happen to them in his care-he would never deal with it or tell me.  If this offends him, thats too bad because I have children to watch out for and respecting someone who has never once in my life given me an ounce of respect, I am surely not going to sacrifice my health and my families health to save his pride.  Thats what they are doing for My Uncle Doug now.    Am I insane for that!?

      This is a journal entry I wrote for my other journal I keep for my phsycologist.  Thought it to be somehow relevant to my mood.   "  I Just got done watching the movie "Cruel Intentions" The story moves me, but it's terribly tragic.  It kinda makes me feel like the whole world is selfish- immoral, and punitive.  It sometimes makes me feel as though the Devil has always kept our souls.  Like being "good" is something of a lottery- the odds aren't in favor.    I think we are all inherently Evil.  Some of us just have more self discipline.    I knew when I was a kid what I wanted to be- I was soooo absolutely sure.  NOW I HAVE NO MEANING..... I simply drift......

      Last night was the worst night of all nights for me.  I had fun, but maybe a little too much.    I became enraged with a nasty bitch at the bar.  Typically, I do not sucumb to such meaningless bar squabbles.  I find them immature and undisciplined.  But last night was one of those situations no matter how hard you tried to be the better person, the ignoramus jack-ass has got to keep pushing it to the next level.  Well she pushed me well far beyond my breaking point.  Well past, so far past that sanity was lost in the dust of my high speed trailing anger.  She was intentionally instagating an argument in the bar in front of her friends.  i let it be and I let it be.  Then her and her friends began congregating and threatening me and my friends.  It was something out of an old James Dean flick, I swear.     It was rediculous I got up to use the bathroom and sure as shit the bitch said something to the effect of I will kill you bitch with her ugly aging ass of a friend backing her up.    I was just completely sick of this bitch.  So i said "If you got that big of an issue with me, perhaps we should take care of ity in the parking lot, because I am really sick of this shit."  Well the bitches friend got in my face and started poitning her finger at me and poking me and shit, so I grabbed the bitches finger and twisted it til she fell to her knees, and then bam all the bouncers were on me like white on rice.  I am a regular there, the bitch was not.  They kick me out for the night.  So I go over to my friends house and wait for my chick pals to show up.    Sure as shit my chick pals all get kicked out for gettying in her shit too.  And little bad-ass bitch was "escorted" out to her car.  Why the fuck do people dish shit out, that they are not going to finish.  I would have been fine with her talking shit about me all she wanted as long as she left me the fuck alone.  I am not a violent person, but when principle is envolved i do have a mighty hard time backing down.  That bitch can rot for all the fuck I care.

      I will be setting up another blog page to offer resources to other bloggers.  It has taken me three years to get my blog as far as it has gone.  I do it completely 100% free (unless of course you count internet access.)  Many people's blogs are better than mine............  ...........but damn it, I think mine is pretty good considering its completely free and I really lack computer skills.  I taught myself html script.  So there. Nanananana!  Here is the link: LINK FIXED    urlLink Free Blog Resource Guide     It will basically be just a bunch of junk I wish I knew about like three years ago.  No claim to fame.

But someone with a watchful eye(thanks ~Mysterio~ at http://mentalimage.blogspot.com) out there informed me and reffered me to photobucket.com.  So I have went through and re-did the img src links on previous posts and the side bar.  Please leave a comment and let me know if you can see the images and my profile pic, and their quality,please,please,please.  Here is something to laugh at:

      Ahhh everything is zen.  A bit in pain, but zen.  Today is laughter, goofiness, and all those things that make me somewhat entertaining.  In other news:  I feel this unsettling urge to regroup a band.  I miss singing.  I miss writting.   I am just trying so hard to take care of all my other business first.  I am also lost in that quest to recapture the essence of my self, that I have seemt to loose in all my biligerent drunkeness.  Hopefully at some point it will reoccur to me what the hell I am doing here, and I will stop filling this page with incoherent dribble that is as boring as it is useless.  I think getting sick has revamped me in some ways, but I am still on the path to full recovery, and my destination is not in site as of yet.  But please please please keep comming and keep commenting.  It inspires me.  Who knows you might just give me the kick in the ass I truley need and deserve.

      In between is the only way to describe it.  I don't feel completely in-the-gutter, burning-in-purgatory depression, but I can taste its elements and feel its spirit.    Its like your heart squeezing your lungs........  Its like walking alone at night and that feeling of being afraid to look back and not know where you came from.  I have thought deeply about why I feel like this.  Why things bug me more than the rest.  Why I can't accept things that most people see as life.  Maybe cause I am not satisfied with my niche in life.   Maybe cause in all my fantasy, my daydreaming, my pre-adult experience, I never thought I would be a "nobody."  And a "nobody," is exactly what I am.  I have presence, I am carasmatic, I meet tons of people who seem to cling.  Old people love me becauser they can vicarously recapture their youth with my careless dynamics.  Young people like me because I am not afraid to say or do what they have always wanted but never could.  But because of this it centers me in this freeakish lonliness amongst a crowd.  I always feel lonely. I always feel jaded. I always feel dishonest. I always feel tactlessly truthful. I always feel hopelessly detached from the strings that hold most sane and logical thinking people down.  The difference between this day and the rest?  I am sober, I am unable to escape the screaming voices in my head.  I am "trying" to do the right thing.

So I will maintain that I am still alive and let this space be, due to my un-dying urge to only fill this space with semi-interesting shit.  Hopefully I will heal quickly and be able to elaborate about some juicy shit once I can go out and experience life again.

      Well as I last posted, I was confined to the hospital for 3 days.  Which in retrospect, seems more like I was held captive at a science lab.  I swear I got poked with so many needles I have no idea how to begin counting the numbers.  When I first arrived at the emergency room Monday morning around 1 am, there were about 3 different doctors whom I had to recap the misery I was in from start to finish, despite my erge to kill over and die.  Then sometime after that they decided to do a cat scan of my brain, a urine, blood work, and a spinal tap.    The spinal tap itself consisted of several pokes because the intern just couldn't seem to get it in the right spot, finally the resident doctor gave it a go and finally finished the procedure.  So that was a shot to numb the area 3 incisions the first go around and the another shot to numb the area, and anoter three tries before they finally were able to finish the procedure.  So after another period the cam and hooked me up to an IV, which also consisted of several stabs due to my rolling veins.  They gave me morphine, via injection, and anti-nausea medecine, via injection.  This morphine/anti-nausea combo lasted for about 3 go rounds before they came and admitted me.  I have spinal miningitis!  Not long after that the morphine lost its potency against the pain, and they switched to demerol, via injection.  I feel asleep and around 10 am they finally got me to my room.  More blood work, via needle, And more pain/anti-nausea combos, via injection.   AFter awhile it got annoying because it was morning day and night.  But I do feel better, so I suppose it was not in vain.

      Sorry I have been gone for the last three days, unfortunately, and quite cursedly, I came down with viral spinal miningitis.  Yes, you heard me correctly.  BTW the bacterial kind is the one that is contagious!  What the hell!!! SO this bout of sickness cost me three days in the hospital!  I swear if I  get sick one more time this summer i am going to have frenzied fit!  I am sick and tired of being sick and tired!!!!

      Just wanted to posta pic of a good friend of mine.     She is really cool, and it is not everyday you come across people, who are actually decent and good people.  We hit it off right away and I am happy to have found her.  Especially since most of my close friends (only two others) live out-of-state.  I find it somewhat amusing that she is from out-of-state.

      Today I was watching tv and a radio station advertisement for the local whiney happy no-cuss radio station aired.  It made a comment  Music to compliment your life.......not complicate it.  And also   Music that won't embarass you in front of your children.  You know what I think is complicating?  The fact that we as people hold so much emphasis on words as opposed to actions.  People will hold their breath and become completely appalled by Nine Inch Nails' "Fuck You Like An Animal".  But because the Music is so cute on "Follow Me" by Uncle Cracker and it lacks in-your-face profanity they fail to realize he is talking about having an affair with a married woman, telling her that the sex is good, but dont bother trying to leave her husband for him cause he won't stay he has "other puddles and streams to be fishing in."  Thats sick.  Also what is embarassing is parents are so scared to talk to their kids.  I don't know anyone who has learned anything by avoidance of the subject, if anything the gain incorrect information from those who are all too willing to share their lack of experience with everyone else.  WAKE UP!  censorship is un-american.  If we take away freedom of speech we migh as well elect Saddam Hussein President.

      First of all I just want to say...... "I LOVE THE NEW BLOGGER!" Its so much easier to navigate and incorparates so many new personalizations that just were not present before, and the best thing of all they offer this under their free service.  High five Blogger, you have made my day!  But onward, (I hate to be so commercial-but I am genuinely elated over the recent changes)  I am patting myself on the back I finally figured out how to set up an image directory, so I can write pictures into my site via html code.  The last puzzle piece has been laid in place!  So needless to say I will have a more interesting blog with pics now.  Here is one for you-inspired by something I saw a while ago on cop talk (linked under fav blogs) but it was printed in reverse on his page- so I remodeled the pic a bit to reflect a more truthful analysis lol.  enjoy.

      Some people just piss me off.  There is this one chick who frequents the bar I got to (or at least did until I ran her off) She is one of those nastybar slut types, and she was trying to sack a male friend of mine, so instead of just confronting him, she starts making comments like...  "you'd be so pretty in you wore more eyeliner" or "you'd be so pretty with red streaks in our hair"  well she kept going on and on like thisall the while I am just politely smiling over gritting teeth.    Then she said...  "you shouldn't wear such dark lipstick, it makes you llo trashy, and I can tell your a good girl."  I snapped!  I was like "you know what, name, you'd be so much prettier with a paper bag on your head and a potatoe sack covering your fat rolls."  She took off.  It might be immature but.....

      Sometimes I feel so isolated from the world.  I feel like I am sitting in a train looking out the window at the scenic pictures of life and reality wishing I can join but I just keep moving on into the future without notice.   I feel like its a dance that I merely spin bymyself in the corner while others couple up dance and hardly notice me. The harder I fight to get noticed the harder I try to be heard the father into the abyss of solitude I slip.  Its tooo much for me to bear at times, but I am slowly rising from the ashes to reclaim my place in the world. I just take each breath as it comes and try not to embrace my reality, because I fear if I do, then I will simply succome to my fate due to the boundries accepting such harsh truths would cause.  I miss the me who was take charge, on-top-of-the-world, better-than-you-give-me-credit-for, charasmatic, awesome, individuial that seems to be evolving to something alien and unfarmiliar.  Is it merely a stage in the cycles of my bi-polar, or is a cruel satire of what adulthood brings to the aging soul.  I am not sure.  I will just keep on humming David Bowie Tunes until I gain my ground.

      Today I feel crapy.  It seems like lately I am sick more often than not.  I am taking these parenting classes one is called Conflict Resolution, and the other is Creative Discipline.  Those have intrenched me in this world of second-guessing everything I do.  So my confidence level has wallowed into the gutter of literal disaster.  I just feel insignificant, unimportant, and unnoticed.    I just wish I was normal.  SOmetimes it is evry frustrating being bi-polar.  I want to be happy.  I want the past to dissapear and I want a clear path to where my future leads to appear.  I am sick of living stuck in a moment that I cna't get out of it.

      I don't really have much to say.  I feel kind of blah lately, I think I might be entering some sort of depression.  Social settings are usually idealic for me, but lately I have just felt like an outsider where ever I go.  I have ate a lot lately, and then some days hardly at all.  I want to sleep all the time, and I fell like crap physically.  I am so aggrivated.  SO frustrated. I just wish I could close my eyes and wake up to a new day that didn't feel so crapy.  I need to clean my house.  That would help.  I think the mere disarray of my home is probably diabling any ability I have to be happy.  Tomorrow is another day.

         Tonite i have Anger Management.  I am sure I will only become intolerably mad by the 13 year old in the class who as most 13 year olds, think they know the ropes well enough to lecture the rest of the adults in the class.  I got a bit pissy the week before last because she was "angry" because her mom wouldn't let her do what she wanted and have people over.  But the kid gets c's and d's.  She is dissrespectful, sloppy, refuses to do anything for herself, let alone anyone else.  So Speak up.  I am like what have you done to earn anything that you "want."  She says, "I clean my room and unload the dishwasher."  She is serious.  She thinks this deserves unquestioned freedom.  I say " You shouldn't be too angry if that's all you have to do.  Because those are things everyone has to do and unless your a maid and that is your paid profession, you seldom get paid or rewarded by it.  You need to grow up, and realize the world don't revolve around you."  I know, I shouldn't have snapped, but she was pissing me off so bad.   What an ingrate.

      Sitting here in a lack-luster daze daydreamming about life, letting the words of Janis Joplin's "summertime" song drill thru my head repeatedly. SOmething about the music arrangement of this song tempts me to imagine such glorified evil.  My soul swings in the balance with each cursing guitar rift.  And the pain inside weeps with the light strumming.  I need to wake from this sleep that I have drifted off into.  I sit here and await the magical kiss that will free me from my minds prison.    Sometimes the chains that have been placed upon me will let me be free for moments just to torture me more when they return to their guarded locked position.  To make me miss that freedom i so desire just that much more.  This ill fate sometimes feels self-inflicted.  Perhaps it is affirmitively so.  But sometimes I can't help but believe I am living out the sentance for crimes I've commited in a past life.

Woke up Thursday with hella-hangover.But it was fun.  My Pool stick got stolen which is hard to fathom in the pretentious nose snubbing area we were at. But in any event I am glad to be home.

      Twisting, turning, tied up, cried out.... Pain, peeling, passive yet learning. Frustrated, fearful, fragile, frantic. Breaking away from the whole. A piece, a fragment, a division of the original. In, out or inbetween witness to sights unseen. Maddness, mercy, macabre. Disillusioned fantasies. Wandering, lost, left behind... Insanity curses me one more time.

      I have noticed that lately I have been becomming worse.  More Grandoise dellusions, my self- image is so different from what people actually see me as.  And I have developed some very strange obsessions.  Is my health completely deteriating.  I have noticed that I have been completely avoiding mental health issues in my blog.  Has my lack of self-awareness led me astray?  I feel nauseous.  I feel alone, but amongst the crowds of people who care.  I feel as tough the person they see is not me.  I feel stuck in another persons life.  Like it isn't me, never was.  It in hand brings these feeling of isolation that I have no other explanation for than being bi-polar. What the hell!??!!  My father who is Catholic expects me to believe in this thing called christianity, but just how can I do this with such frightening illnesses being born onto one?  It's a crock.  The world as we know it is a crock.  We preach prosperity and freedom, but we suffer within self derived prisons.   I am a nothing.  A big NOTHING.  I hate this. I hate life, I hate the world.

      Yep I did an ol' proactive and enrolled myself in Anger Management.  Thought it might be a good idea since the little man that busts two by fours in my head has been going kinda fruity lately.    I am sick again.  Same chest and sinus shit I had last month.  I am quite sick of this shit.  It must be all the drinking.  I have to be dehydrated or something.  Well at least this time it seems like its getting better quicker.  I hope I am well enough to celebrate my birthday this Friday.  Also, I am going to Ohio with my friend Jill the 21st-23rd.  So If I drop out of site for a bit, don't be alarmed.  Ok well I am hungry got to go.  Keep it real.

      Getting closer and closer to Birthday.  Panic. Twenty-four is not that old, but they are comming so fast it feels like if I don't keep my eyes open, I might miss everything in between now and 34.  Jeesh!  Aging what a curse.  Must be in place for the same reason Bees die when they sting.  What can you do?  But in any event, I have to get off here.  Tonite is my designated drinking to oblivion night.  I am a few short hours from drownding my aging woes in some ice cold bud light.  Somewhat a bittersweet mental image occurs.   Peace, Love, and Sunshine,  Tiffany  P.S.  I can even begin to imagine how funny or depressing this post will be upon the eve of my 34th birthday.

      Well I am off to the beach, first time sense we have lived here.   We finally get to utilize the thousands of lakes the exist in our small town area.  I will write back later. Peace, Love and Sunshine.  Oh BTW Brent I have no idea why you feel guilty, perhaps it's the way people's attitudes change against the cops when they get their hand caught in the cookie jar and are actually made accountiable finacially for their actions.  But no worries here, I choose not to be angry about getting a ticket for something I knew was against the law.  It's like duh on my part!

      Yep, I was an idiot.  I got finished at the bank, forgot to buckle my seat belt and rove in to a massive click it or ticket zone.  But the police officer was really cool.  He saw that my kids were strapped in, and I didn't try to lie about having my seat belt on (cause I did snap it before I got pulled over cause I saw all the cops with people pulled over but they had already seen me without it)  So he gacve me a break and instead of the typical 89.00-115.00 dollar ticket I only got a 65.00.  I made it's point, I have been diligent about buckeling up since.

         Adaptable and versatile Communicative and witty Intellectual and eloquent Youthful and lively Nervous and tense Superficial and inconsistent Cunning and inquisitive  Gemini, the sign of the Twins, is dual-natured, elusive, complex and contradictory. On the one hand it produces the virtue of versatility, and on the other the vices of two-facedness and flightiness. The sign is linked with Mercury, the planet of childhood and youth, and its subjects tend to have the graces and faults of the young. When they are good, they are very attractive; when they are bad they are more the worse for being the charmers they are. Like children they are lively, and happy, if circumstances are right for them, or egocentric, imaginative and restless. They take up new activities enthusiastically but lack application, constantly needing new interests, flitting from project to project as apparently purposelessly as a butterfly dancing from flower to flower.   To them life is a game which must always be full of fresh moves and continuous entertainment, free of labor and routine. Changing horses in the middle of the stream is another small quirk in the Gemini personality which makes decision making, and sticking to a decision, particularly hard for them.Since they lack the quality of conscientiousness, they are apt to fight a losing battle in any attempts they make to be moral (in the widest sense of the word). Their good qualities are attractive and come easily to them. They are affectionate, courteous, kind, generous, and thoughtful towards the poor and suffering - provided none of the activities resulting from expressing these traits interferes too greatly with their own lives and comforts. They quickly learn to use their outward attractiveness to gain their own ends, and when striving for these they will use any weapon in their armory - unscrupulous lying, and cunning evasiveness; escaping blame by contriving to put it on other people, wrapped up in all the charm they can turn on. In their better moments they may strive to be honest and straightforward, but self-interest is almost always the victor. If things go against them, they sulk like children. Also like children, they demand attention, admiration, and the spending on them of time, energy and money, throwing tantrums if they don't get what they want. They reflect every change in their surroundings, like chameleons, and can become pessimistic, sullen, peevish and materialistically self-centered if circumstances force them to struggle in any way. If the conditions of life become really adverse, their strength of will may desert them entirely.   They can become uncertain of themselves, either withdrawn, or nervously excitable worriers, sullenly discontented, hard and irritable, with "Self" looming ever larger in their struggles. On the other hand their versatility can make them very adaptable, adjusting themselves to control the world around them by means of their inherent ingenuity and cleverness.Most Gemini have a keen, intuitive, sometimes brilliant intelligence and they love cerebral challenges. But their concentration, though intense for a while, does not last. Their mental agility and energy give them a voracious appetite for knowledge from youth onward, though they dislike the labor of learning. They easily grasp almost everything requiring intelligence and mental dexterity, and are often able to marry manual skills to their qualities of mind. Their intellect is strongly analytical and sometimes gives them so great an ability to see both sides of a question that they vacillate and find it hard to make decisions. But their intelligence may very well be used to control and unify the duality of their natures into a most efficient unit.   If faced with difficulties, they have little determination to worry at a problem until they find a solution - they will pick the brains of others. In their intellectual pursuits, as in other departments of their lives, they risk becoming dilettantes, losing themselves in too many projects which they follow until they become difficult.In love they are fickle, not intentionally so but because of the basic inconsistency of their emotional nature, which has an amoral aspect to it. Their is a side to Geminians which can become deeply involved emotionally, and another, hostile to sentimentality, which stands back from a romantic situation, laughing at it and the protagonists in it, including themselves while analyzing it intellectually.   Gemini subjects take nothing seriously. So, in love, in spite of their temporary depth of feeling, for the intensity of involvement lasts only while it is new, they are superficial, light-hearted, cool, flirtatious and unimaginative in the understanding of the pain they may give others. They like intrigue, the excitement of the chase, but once they have caught the prey, they lose interest and look around for the next creature to pursue. In less serious situations they make witty, entertaining companions, good acquaintances rather than friends. Even at their worst they are never dull - there is usually playfulness below the surface, and they can be brilliant conversationalists - but they can also be quarrelsome, prattlers, boasters, liars and cheats.Geminians can be successful in many walks of life though their general characteristics tend to make them unreliable. They are often skilled manipulators of language, in speech and writing, and may be: debaters, diplomats (though in politics they are more interested in theory than practice), orators, preachers (brilliant rather than profound), teachers, authors, poets, journalists, or lawyers.   In business any work which combines quick-wittedness with a change of surroundings suits them; working as a traveling salesperson, brokerage work, or dealing with the public in any capacity is right up their alley. Because they are dispassionate, logical, rational and analytical they make good scientists, especially in the fields of medicine and astronomy. They can also make excellent members of the Armed Forces, for they take danger no more seriously than anything else and can earn themselves a reputation for devotion to duty and heroic acts. In the arts they may excel in music, painting and sculpture. They make good psychic researchers of a sceptical kind. Negatively they can degenerate into confidence tricksters, thieves and even adepts in the black arts.   Possible Health Concerns...   Gemini rules the arms, shoulders, hands, lungs and nervous system and its subjects need to beware of diseases and accidents associated with the upper part of the body, as well as nervous and pulmonary disorders such as catarrh and bronchitis. Their mercurial nature may also affect a constitution which is not strong if it is put under strain.You are prone to taking unnecessary risks and wind up harming yourself or others in the process. Sometimes pursuing pleasure too vigorously could also qualify as risk taking.    LIKES  Talking  Novelty and the unusual  Variety in life  Multiple projects all going at once  Reading    DISLIKES  Feeling tied down  Learning, such as school  Being in a rut  Mental inaction  Being alone

      Planet Earth is Blue, and there is nothing left to do.   Man that line from space oddity by David Bowie rocks.  It so describes so many emotions that we don't accept.  People don't see the metaphor.  Life is what life is, and freedom, true unbridled freedom comes from the acceptance of reality.    There are always going to be circumstances, truths, and choices, and people and personalities, and beliefs, religions, and preferences that we don't agree with or you, or me don't agree with.  But the beauty of life is that life goes despite your resistance.  Planet Earth is Blue and there is nothing you can do.

      I am PISSED!  This is a continuation from my "Damn Drunken belligerence" post.    I went to Mo'Doggies again Sunday night.  Everything was fine left at closing.  Shit was good, except Al, one of the bartenders said I needed to talk to Dave next time he is working.  So sure as shit, I come in their Tuesday and Dave is working.  He says "Tiffany, your not supposed to be in here."  And I was like "What?!"  Because the night all that shit happened they said I could come back that I just had to go home that night. So as it turns out, Dave thinks and believes I waited around til closing and Me Jill And Jessica were all out in the parking lot harassing this girl, but I had left like a hour before close.  What bull-shit.  I wish I would have just busted a beer bottle in her face, at least then getting barred would not have been in vain.  Now my birthday is going to have to be re-planned.  Oh well!  These are the rewards for controlling physical temper.  And this is exactly why the cops stay busy.  People assuming shit- they have a god damn video surveillance system, they could have checked it and seen that I left!  What's worse is my "cohorts" didn't get barred.   BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT

        So, So you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain. Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?  And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?  How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, Running over the same old ground. What have we found? The same old fears. Wish you were here.

      I am in a good mood not depressed at all. I have no worries, cause I ain't in no hurry. You know, one of those perfect days were every song you here drops into some colorful soundtrack of your life.  In all this happiness and freetime I start dissecting the path of orgin which this happiness come from.  While backtracking, and basically degressing, I come to the conclusion that my happiness is nothing more than a self delusion.  Maybe all happiness is.  Or maybe I just talked myself out of my own happiness by over-anaylyzing it.  But thats not it because I still have this general feeling of well being.  Maybe somewhere along the lines dissapointment blurred to disatisfaction, and acceptance was giving in to depression.  But I have accepted what my life is for now, and I am not depressed.....   ........perhaps I am becomming an adult.  Maybe.

      I got all my crap together to go to the college and get enrolled, I just got to go pick up my transcripts, and apply for financial aid.  But I am waiting for my PIN number to do that online (I did already apply for a pin, but it takes 3 business days to get all that crap back just to even apply for financial aid online)  But I am starting to get excited.  I am finally not procrastinating.  Plus I get a discount at rubes on college night with a college ID!  So YAY!!!!!  Although I doubt I will be going out too much when I go back to school.  Man this is going to be great!! To get back into school.  Finish my schooling, and have something to be proud of.  I will be so happy.  Well I got tons more shit to do, so I will talk to you all later.

      Amidst all this rain, and the troublesome shit that has become my life I have found a ray of sunshine in the middle.  The hope for the future.  I am signing up for classes.  I want to go back to school.  I need a college education.    I am so bored with the lack of accomplishment that has become who I am.  I need something that is mine, something to be proud of, some lable of personal integrity to flaunt.  Well in any case I am tired.  I don't know what else to write.  My mind is blank.  The blankness that occurs when too many different sounds are combined together, and become nothing.

And kill people I hate (well, not really, but the fantasy is amusing)  I am so tired my mood sucks.  I have been on a bitch tangent.  I am so aggrivated, I just want to take a personal vacation.  Go lay up ina hotel, with a swimming pool.  Away from everyone and everything. Pack a dil-do, some beer, some smokes and some clean underware and videos and I would be good to go.

      I was really depressed.  I was keeping myself busy to avoid the feelings, and when I was home I convinced myself I wasn't depressed, so it manifested itself into a lack of motivation, and extreme fatigue, and an outstanding urge to drink.  BUT    Now I really am Manic, I think i have slowly went manic within the last two days. I am on top of things.  Becomming routine.  SO much energy, from the fuel of my ideas and inspirations.  COmplete ecstacy without, having to do anything.  I feel happy staying at home at night.  I have been kinda spending a little more than I should.  But, otherwise I have been doing good.   I love the manic.  It makes life enjoyable, instead of advertising its bleak and harsh realities like depression and normalcy does.  I hope this mania sticks around for awhile.

      In Michigan the weather is generally good in the summer, but this summer has been one of the rainiest I have been alive to remember.&nbsp; Not that its horrible, because the particular spot I live in tends to be sunny at least some part of the day.&nbsp; But its still like blah.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Maybe I am just tired.&nbsp; I feel like I have been running so fast that once I get to my destination, I won't remember how I got there.&nbsp; Or like going weeks without sleep, to the point you can't figure out what's real and what's not. &nbsp; I am just frazzled.&nbsp; Too much stress, too much shit going on.&nbsp; You know when you start doing something to keep yourself from dealing with something else and you slowly become prisoner to it?&nbsp; Thats exactly where I am at.&nbsp; I imagine addiction to substances feels this way.&nbsp; I mean thats what drug abuse is right?&nbsp; A form of avoidance?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; ALl i do know is that I am not happy and If I deal with it I am liable to make some rash decisions that could ultimately screw my life all to hell.&nbsp; Well, my life might already be screwd all to hell. &nbsp; I miss Jill, she needs to come home from Ohio.&nbsp; If she was here, shit wouldn't seem so draggy. &nbsp; Oh well, it's just one day in a series of days.

       Whats sad is that I have done 85% of the things on this list, and knowing my level of immaturity I will probably do the other stuff now that the idea has been planted in my head!  urlLink      1. Take shopping carts for the express purpose of filling themand stranding them at strategic locations.     2. Ride those little electronic cars at the front of the store.     3. Set all the alarm clocks to go off at ten-minute intervalsthroughout the day.     4. Don't bother doing your own shopping.&nbsp; Simply find someone with a full trolley containing roughly the items you need, and when they are not looking take it and go pay for it at the checkout. (this is not stealing, they did not own the items yet, they were simply 'moving them around')     5. Contaminate the entire auto department by sampling all thespray air fresheners.     6. Challenge other customers to duels with tubes of gift-wrap.     7. Leave cryptic messages on the typewriters.     8. Re-dress the mannequins as you see fit, then arrange them into erotic poses. (be creative with the gift-wrap tubes used in point 6).     9. When there are people behind you, walk really slowly,especially in thin aisles.     10. Walk up to an employee and tell him in an official tone, "Ithink we've got a code 3 in housewares," and see what happens.     11. Turn all the radios to polka stations; then turn them offand turn the volume up to full blast.     12. Re-enact a fatal incident involving the automatic doors.     13. Walk up to complete strangers and say, "Hi. I haven't seenyou in so long." etc. See if they play along.&nbsp; Insist on calling them 'Bob', and if they protest, get angry about it (violent if necissary).     14. While walking through the clothing department, ask yourselfloud enough for all to hear, "Who buys this crap anyway?!"     15. When you leave the store, try your car keys in the door of every car&nbsp;in the car park&nbsp;until you get to your own.&nbsp; Then drive off as if this is perfectly normal. (Note- if you don't actually own a car and walked to the store, attempt the above by substituting car keys with your house keys).     16.Ride a display bicycle through the store; claim you aretaking it for a test drive.     17. Follow people through the aisles, staying about 5 feetbehind them. Do this until they leave the store.     18. Ask if you can test some super-glue before buying it, then walk around the store gluing random items to other items/customers/staff.&nbsp; For added fun: See how many cashiers you can glue to each-other before any of them notice.     19. As the cashier runs your purchase over the scanner say "BEEP" in a loud voice.&nbsp; Repeat this for every item, and for other customers items.&nbsp; If the cashier protests, kill them.   20. Take off your shoes and tell them you want to return it andwhen they say you didn't buy it there say "The customer is always right dammit!!"&nbsp; Make a scene.      21. Move "Caution : Wet Floor" signs to carpeted areas.     22. Set up a tent in the camping department; tell others youwill only invite them in if they bring pillows from Bed and Bath.     23. Test the fishing rods and see what you can catch from otheraisles.     24. Ask other customers if they have any Grey Poupon.     25. Drape a blanket around your shoulders and run around saying,"I'm Batman. Come Robin, to the Batcave."     26. Climb things.     27. Randomly throw things over into neighboring aisles.     28. Play with the calculators so that they all spell "hello"upside down. Once you have mastered this, progress to "boobs".     29. When someone asks you if you need help, begin to cry andsay, "Why won't you people just leave me alone?"     30. When 2 or 3 people are walking ahead of you, run betweenthem yelling "Red Rover."     31. Make up nonsense products and ask employees if there are anyin stock. (i.e.: Shnerples).&nbsp; Do a vague hand-mime of what a 'Shnerple' looks like to assist them.     32. Take up an entire aisle in toys by setting up a full-scalebattle with G.I. Joe vs. X-men.     33. Take bets on the battle from above.     34. Test the brushes and combs in Cosmetics on all the live animals in Pet-Care.     35. While handling guns in the hunting department, suddenly askthe clerk where the anti-depressants are. Act as spastic aspossible.     36. Hold indoor shopping cart races.     37. Dart around suspiciously while humming the theme fromMission Impossible.     38. Attempt to fit into very large gym bags.     39. Attempt to fit others into very large gym bags against their will.     40. Say things like, "Would you be so kind as to direct me toyour Twinkies."     41. Set up a "Valet Parking" sign in front of the store.     42. Two words: Marco Polo.     43. Leave Cheerios in lawn and garden, pillows in the petsection, etc.     44. "Re-alphabetize" the CD's using an alternative alphabet of your choosing.     45. In the auto department, practice your Madonna look withvarious funnels.     46. When someone steps away from his or her cart to look atsomething, quickly place random combinations of items in their cart, such as 'A Large Cucumber and a Tub of Vasceline'.     47. Relax in the patio furniture drinking beer until you get kicked out.     48. When an announcement comes over the loudspeaker, drop toyour knees and scream, "No, no, its those voices again."     49. Pay off layaways 50 cents at a time.     50. Drag a lounge chair over to the magazines and relax. Go tothe food court, buy a drink, and explain that you don't get outmuch and ask if they can put a little umbrella in it.

      There is a little blogwar going on out there:  Check it out    urlLink Sex With Strangers   Vs.     urlLink Billy D. Williams: Super Pimp     The war is within the commenting sections on each of their blogs, but i do believe that the author of "sex" copy and pasted a whole post dedicated to it.  I try not to take sides on these things, but I got to say that this Billy D. seems like a complete doof based on his site alone.  Then when you get into his spelling and grammer and his "colorful" made-up vocabulary- he just seems like a complete leandrathal.    He refers to women as ho's.  He is one of those people that the rest of the black culture denies being their own, because he is embarassing to the entire race.  But he thinks he the shizzel, for rizzel my nizzel.  LOL!

      I seep into the reflective silver surface I see the things I wish not to see little neglected bits and pieces of me those things we ignore those things we wish not see anymore  We find these things in those who are different  we make them the enemy for contrasting purpose we tell ourselves we are righteous we lie, steal, hate, contradict  just to escape the guilt within.  Belittle your peers it gives you sense of self it helps you hide your sins it makes you feel good within.  Need no justification, just dig right in. Serve your self, and your self-serving opinions who cares about lack of empathy, we are fighting the good fight aren't we? It's up to me to decide for the fool whats best for them. They'd be lost without me why wont they see?  Appease their short term needs sell them life times in safe cells  in exchange for brief moments of fear. Strip them of their rights, their freedoms so you can sleep at night.

       Perfect example why Bush needs to be voted out of office is perfectly demonstrated by the author of  urlLink Coptalk  Or at least this is what I have noticed and assumed. I could be wrong. Since I have taken my anti-bush stance (around July 4th) this former supporter has deleted my link of his blog and not made one stop by my site. This I am almost positive is due to my remarks about the war and the senseless dieing of troops for Bush’s superiority complex. This is why Republicans are dangerous. If they don’t agree the white you out, hide you, push you aside, and when someone falls in the whole the have created to hide the facts, they point the finger to someone else.  Republicans take away freedoms with their special interest agendas. People approve of this man for taking over Iraq. For being as dictating as Saddam himself. People don’t fool yourself into believing that just because Bush doesn’t use the same tactics as Saddam, that it makes him any different than Saddam.  Also upon a survey I recently completed, you will be interested to know that those who support Bush for re-election are broken down in these categories:   3% Liked his father and that is why they will re-elect Bush.  15% Approved of his handling of 9/11. Even though he really has not handled it at all. Congress formed the 9/11 commission which is lack luster at best. Bush merely endorsed what intelligence told him was a good idea. Also we forget that the search for Osama Bin Laden has practically been abandoned so he could fund his witch hunt over the oil hoarder Saddam and his interference with Bush’s ability to profit in the market of oil.  37% Actually are voting for Bush because someone told them to and have no reliable information about either candidate, OR they feel, also operating on a very limited knowledge of the facts, that Bush is the lesser of two evils.  55% Are voting for Bush simply because he is a Republican. More than half of these people have a low approval of Bush but are voting for him because they refuse to elect a democrat and pay more taxes.  People let me explain something to you. This country is know in a national deficit. Taxes will come whether it be now or later, your only sweeping the mess under the rug for your children to deal with. Republican have been notoriously guilty of cutting taxes to appease the people short-term, while killing programs that are needed in our schools and communities to fund it. A republican vote is a “Me” vote, a democratic vote is an “US AS A WHOLE” vote.  And I am terribly sorry Brett if my words offended you, but I am offended by your snuffing. If Bush is so wonderful why do people feel the need to stifle or hide objecting opinions and facts. What is it that they have got to hide. Hmm.. Could it be their selfish personal interests they are trying to protect?

       Another out-landish desperate attempt to hold on to the spot light. This cast consists of Former Motley man Vince Neil, The kid who was on Webster in his adult midget sized form (which they feel free to exploit btw,) The infamous Mc Hammer, Some bitch from “survivor,” another chick named Brande (not sure who the hell she is ( I’m thinking Bay Watch,) Andrea from 90210, and last but not least Corey Feldman. Corey Feldman is the most whiney overly sensitive biatch with a capital B that I would have ever imagined him to be. That kid fills so sorry for himself, its hard to have any sympathy for him at all. Plus he has some weird psychosis that makes him turn all his ill logic out on other people. I used to love Corey Feldman. I was die hard in love with him since The Lost Boys. Now he is a joke, a self-made victim. A slave to physiological babble. I have completely lost respect for him in all ventures of his life. He is immature, pathetic and unbelievably selfish. But on a more positive note, I have new found additional respect for Vince Neil, who is indeed the strength character of the show. And I feel for his losses in life. And I also feel bad that he has to listen to Corey Feldman whine about his life when in all reality Vince Neil has death with the ultimate tragedy of loosing a 4 year old daughter to Cancer. If I were Vince I would shot Corey.

       I ate way too much for lunch.  I stayed out way too late last night.  I drank way too much.  I puked.  I got the shits.  My moment of glamour as I left my house last night was slowly dissolved away with every molocule of alcohol I consummed.  Until i was reduced to the make up smeared hung over and strung out mass sprawled across my queen size bed with the stained palm tree sheets with no desire to move.        But....      I will repeat this all again tonite.         Have a nice weekend.

       ...when lived in denial.        Everyday, if I manage to stiffle the screaming noise in my head, I am actually able to surmise some sort of half-assed smile that does its job at fooling the rest of the world that I might for one unforseen second, be happy.        The really odd and intresting truth in all this babble is that I have no real reason that has happened in the current future to be "un-happy."      I have had a lot of shit happen to me (most of the old stuff is at my other page  urlLink http://manicdigestofframp.blogspot.com  )      But this at this time I should be really happy about how things have turned around for me.      But no....      It is like trying to site see on your way to your final destination with a dog biting at your ankles.      You miss all the good shit in the hurried pace to get away from the bad shit.      Maybe that is what I find depressing.  Every year goes faster than the last, I feel I have lost so much time, that I will never see something beautiful in any form than a blur.      But what do you do?

       Well as I am sure anyone with two somewhat well-seeing eyes can tell Manic Digest has undergone yet another transformation.  Change is needed for growth.      Links have been cleaned up, new ones added.  Check them out. If you wish to be linked here please sign my guesbook-its hilarious you'll love it [or else.]      If you do not see your link, it is probably because:      1. Your blogs' views, ideas, or endorsements stiffle or enfringe on others freedoms and/or rights and I choose not to affiliate myself with those types.  The best example of this is the all-to-popular anti-blog.  Now there are anti-blogs that serve a positive purpose, but the typical anti-blog tends to discriminate minorities, and personal choices and freedoms.  I am not boycotting your blog, everyone has the right to feel the way they do, I just won't post a link If I do not want to endorse it.      2. I have not found your link request.  Or if you dispaly links on your page, and have not bothered to link me back.  I do not operate this way for people who do not display links on their page.  If I link you despit the fact that there is no link to my page this means you are really special, and I love your journal.      3. I find your blog hard to follow.  I will not link something that I will not read.  If I can't understand what the hell your talking about, or can't follow your blog, I will not link it.  No one ever claimed me to be the sharpest tool in the shed, so don't take this personally.  People are different and what one might think to be literary genuis could be smut trash, or incoherent dribble to another. [the old adage one mans junk is another's treasure comes to mind.]      4.  If you have asked for a link to your site and feel you blog does not fall under any of these guidelines and i still have not linked you please email me  urlLink psuedosane1980@yahoo.com  and I will look into it and reply with an explanation, assumming you give that much of a shit about my opinion to bother with all that.        Okay well enough about blogging, it is time to blog.

      I was sitting on my ass thinking about the world today, as I often do, but am usually unable to derive any coherent sentance from it.  I was watching Ricki Lake, yes I know, major dumb move.  She had Drag Queens on today who were on a pannel trying to determin if these metro-sexual men, where actually infact gay.  The questions they asked and the assertation they made sent me into a rage.  Yes! Ricki, and todays show as well as all other of Ricki's Gay subject shows continues to perpetuate this stereo-type that all gay men must be sissy-fags (word in terminology, not ment as a slant.)    I happen to think that being gay is a choice in love and sex, not in personality.  Trans-gender, and female acting men can be straight as well as gay.  Not all trans-gender, and feminine men are gay.  So Ricki, do us all a favor, gay and straight alike, and stop perpetuating ignorant stereo-types.  AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY DONT VOTE FOR BUSH!!!!!

      I am cleaning house.  Changing shit.   I would like very much if the people who read here would occasionally let me know they are still alive by dropping a comment or e-mail.  Also, I am deleting links.  There are some of you who never update your journals, or your journals are missing, or you use AOL journals ( I am keeping a few of the AOL journal links, but this is an indicator of how much I like you, trust me.)  It would also be nice if you see your link here for you to link back, unless you don't cross-link on your blog at all.  But if you have cross-links take 5 sec. and do me the favor I have done you k?  The more entertaining shit will be on its way soon.

      Just been hanging round, I am broke.  When I  have went out it has been the curteousy of my good friend Jill.  So there is really nothing to write about right now.  Hopefully shit will get intresting soon, cause I am sort of bored.  LOL.  And I know if I am bored the people who read this must be clicking right on to the next blog.  Be patient, I am sure I will be inspired to write more entertaining crap soon.
