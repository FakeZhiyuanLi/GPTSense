       I despise my Inbox at Planet Command & Conquer. It's like an arch enemy to me now. For some reason, every time I try to open one of my Private Messages it  always  gives me a 504 Connection Timed Out error. Yet at other places, such as Planet Grand Theft Auto my Inbox works fine. I thought that maybe I had too many Private Messages saved at Planet Command &amp; Conquer, so I deleted a total of 350 of them. Go figure though, my Inbox still doesn't work. I hate the damn thing. I wish it'd work right for a change.

      First off, let me introduce myself. My name is Shaina, and this is my blog. It's nearly 3am, I have nothing to do, so I'm making this blog. Why? 'Cause I can. That's why. So I guess I'm pretty much just going to use it to talk about stuff I like, and naturally, stuff I hate. So since I don't have much else to say right now, here's a personal favorite song of mine that ties in with the blog title-  "Living easy, living free, Season ticket on a one-way ride, Asking nothing, leave me be, Taking everything in my stride, Don't need reason, don't need rhyme, Ain't nothing I would rather do, Going down, party time, My friends are gonna be there too!  I'm on the highway to Hell! On the highway to Hell! Highway to Hell! I'm on the highway to Hell!  No stop signs, speed limit, Nobody's gonna slow me down, Like a wheel, gonna spin it, Nobody's gonna mess me round, Hey Satan, payin' my dues, Playing in a rocking band, Hey Momma, look at me, I'm on my way to the promised land!  I'm on the highway to Hell! Highway to Hell! I'm on the highway to Hell! Highway to Hell!  Don't stop me!  I'm on the highway to Hell! On the highway to Hell! I'm on the highway to Hell! On the highway to Hell! Highway to Hell! I'm on the highway to Hell! Highway to Hell! Highway to Hell! Highway to Hell! I'm on the Highway to Hell! Highway to Hell!  And I'm going down, all the way! I'm on the highway to Hell."  AC/DC - Highway to Hell - "Highway to Hell"

      Yep. This year's gonna be great. I just got my schedule of classes for the upcoming school year, and none of them were what I signed up for. So that means I have to go into the school during my summer vacation (DAMMIT!) to get them fixed. Also, for some odd reason like all the teachers are leaving. We lost out principal, our business teacher, one of our computer teachers, one of our wood working teachers, one of our English teachers, two science teachers, one of our mathematics teachers, our French teacher, and one of our Spanish teachers. So that means a good portion of the staff this year is going to be new. I hate this damn place. At least I'm half done with it. Only two years left 'till I'm free.
