I'd do pay sincere attention for the *love* of musique.   urlLink More info about the singer's health...

       &nbsp;  urlLink        urlLink    Artwork by BenVsBen 2004 Courtesy (pic):  urlLink MTV.com    The BEP [Black Eyed Peas] are seeing better days and with their new album (3rd album) - *Elephunk*, it is more catchy than any other Hip-Hop. The band started off with Will.I.Am, who thought 'break dancing' and 'hip-hop' should take a turn, and which would grab more attention than the gangsta wangsta revolution, during the 1990's. Now, in the 2000's it is seen with a weather of change. And nothing's more than this, just... SHUT UP! :)

Usher has been in R&B for more than 10 years (that doesn't makes him, less vulnerable to Justin's). But still, Justin's music lovers *just* seem to confuse with the style both have it on their music. Both are talented guys, but in two different genres, R&B and Pop. Anyway it is good listening to Usher's latest flicks - Yeah!, Burn and most of em in Confessions, but the time You are reading this post, it would be Avril Lavigne and her latest flick.  Avril Lavigne is seen with her latest album and a hit singles as the # 1. Avril Lavigne makes it with her new not-so-bedfellow Slipknot. Time for Mr. Entertainment to be entertained.
