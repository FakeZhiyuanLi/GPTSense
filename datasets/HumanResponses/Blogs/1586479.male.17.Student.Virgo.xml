        YUMYUMTURKEY!   Yeah, this was the best Thanksgiving ever! Great food, family, dirt bikes, and foozeball (is that how you spell it?) with a bunch of drunk guys. Ah, the fun never stops. Ah, yes the dirt bikes. We were on a farm in Pennsylvania (my step-uncle's) and he taught me to ride his Honda racing bike that was modified for dirt bike-ness. It was a blast! 5 speeds on an open field. Nothing like it. Now I know why Katy loves those things so much. Huh. Adrenaline pump. I raced with my little brother and cousin. It was fun. Only one crash, but I'm fine; locked the brakes and the bike slid out from under me. I got pretty muddy, and the shifter on the bike got bent, but that was easily fixable.  We also went site-seeing in Philadelphia (and I did go to a kosher from Jerusalem deli)(and they did have pastrami)(and tongue)(maybe). It was cool, but I am ashamed that I bought things on buy-nothing day. Well, at least most of it went to the natioanl park service; thats a good cause. Well, I'm not too ashamed. I didn't go 'shopping'.  Anyway, on the flight home tonite, me and my brother got free upgrades to first class (long story). When they brought around a tray of assorted goodies, me and my brother helped ourselves to a generous amount of Milano cookies (hey, they're free and we're freeloaders). By generous I mean about 6 or 7 packages. Anyway, the flight attendant gave us both dirty looks and scowled at us the whole rest of the flight. Hm, strange considering the cookies are FREE!!! THERE ARE NO FREAKING RESTRICTIONS ON THE AMOUNT YOU CAN TAKE! ARGH! Does that make us bad people?  Hmmm..also, did lots of thinking on this trip. There are two types of people in this world; those who can take what others tell them on faith, and those who have to have first hand experience. This can apply to many different circumstances. For example, if someone tells me that fire hurts and explains logically why t hurts, and I feel a basic instinct that that is true, then I will believe them and not touch fire. However, there are those that will, despite warnings, put they're hands in the fire and get burned, just to see if it really happened. This could apply to anything from religion to sticking your finger in an electrical socket. I don't smoke, drink, or do drugs? Why? Because people have told me what they can do to you, and deep down I know they are bad, so no matter how much I am tempted to do so (and thats a lot), I don't. I don't need to try it to know its bad. But some people might. I'm not saying either way is wrong, in fact to have a balance of both is the best way to go, but in some situations I personally believe there are situations where one way could lead to something bad.  When asked why people need religion, I thought about it. I realized that people need religion to answer three basic questions that come up in everyone's life: 1)Where did I come from. 2)Why am I here? 3)Where will I go when I die?  All religions, even aitheism, answer these three questions. Every single one. And everyone eventually encounters these three questions in there life, no matter how long they put them off. In fact, this is why so many people find religion when a love one dies. They wonder where they went and whether they will see that person again. It's perfectly natural.  Oh gosh. Lots of thinking feels good.  Alright, goodnite ladies and gents.

        learn? Pshah!   School is out! Yahoo, whipee, and other such celebratory phrases.  But I was really gonna post on something I was thinking about today. And just a disclaimer: I don't mean to offend anyone, these are just thoughts. It is a popular philosophy these days to strive to detach themselves from the, physical plane. I'm not sure this is the way to go. If you think about it, if you strive to make yourself greater or higher or whatever by shedding your physical body, wouldn't that kind of make you less great? It stands to reason that the more planes something exists in, the greater it is. For example, humans exist in two planes that we know of; physical and spiritual. But a rock only exists in the physical plane, ad it is obvious that a human is greter than a rock. So rather than striving to detach ourselves from the physical plane, why not embrace it? I'm not saying to be totally wordly and obsessed with physical possesions, but strive for a balance of physical and spiritual existence. Balance is essential.  I suppose this line of thought also applies to many common deities today. The majority of deities worshipped are believed to exist on some far away spiritual plane. But it is also believed that these deities are greater than humans. If so, how can these deities be greater than humans if they don't exist in a plane that humans do? Maybe these deities do exist in the physcial plane, yet people only believe, because they are so great and thus non-human, that they exist far away on some other plane that we can't understand. Maybe in all actuality, our deities are on somewhere in space laughing their heads off at us silly humans.  Sorry if that made no sense at all. I probably could have worded it much better. O well. If anybody has any questions or arguments about this email me. I am tired. time to....zzzzzzzzzzzz  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...................

        ugh.   I haven't posted in sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long. Actually a week. But that's a long time. Yes.  Yesterday at lunch there was an interesting debate. I won't go into it, but it was fun; Conner, Mary Kate and I 'discussing' things with Brian. Yes. Discussing. And we determined liberals are always attractive people.  Only three more classes to thanksgiving break! Yeah!  \\--->internal error 546; memory error *zap* Tim: "GAHHHHH!!! I'm on fire!!!!!!!!!!! The burning!!!!!!!" *zap* Tim: "gurgle..."  Yeah, I recently discovered I'm not who I think I am. I went on a long journey to find myself, or so I thought, but it turns out I was just at Carribou Coffee down the street. Who would of thunk it? I had a nice long discussion with myself. I found out I am actually a b-type, despite what I thought I was before.  I am too tired and unable to think to post about anything important, so I'm going to go draw now. I want to make political cartoons. I have good ideas. But I forgot them.  Also, to all my friends:  You are all beautiful people.   as he fades into the backdrop of the universe......adieu

        Yay for thought   After truly reading Conner's latest blog entry on love and consumerism, I kinda came up with a simple phrase to sum up what I got out of it:   Consumerism is not the problem, the unhealthy lust for physical possessions is the problem; as soon as we overcome that lust and turn it into love towards other human beings, the we will truly be free from the gluttonous American consumerism that plagues us today.

        Dazed and Confused   Ever get so bogged down with work you can't think straight? Your mind goes blank every time you try to think and you can't get your work done? I got that tonite. Yes, that's how 'tonight' is spelled.  I just 'suspended myself' from wrestling, hopefully for the rest of the season. I have spent over 17 years on this planet and I finally realized something; I hate organized sports. I hate them. I love a pick-up game of football or hacky-sack or something, but all these sports are way too damn competitive! I understand it's some people's thing, but it's not mine. I'm not good at any sports, I think most of them are barbaric, and I think they have lost sight of their true origins: they started off as games. GAMES!! Aren't games supposed to be, ya know, enjoyable?! I supposed my view isn't very widely spread since our school is totally sports oriented (academics? arts? what are those?). I just hate the sports credits that are required at school. It takes so much time away from important things like family and homework. I don't regret stopping wrestling; I just joined it to see if I like it or not.  ahh....that feels better.  And now, with the all the extra time I have I can actually get a hold on all my work that was due a long time ago and maybe even start reading a book or two I've been meaning to.  Blogs ARE very therapeutic. wow.  So, I must go get foodstuffs now.  hasta lavista, baby

        And the winner is...   Yeah, the play competition rocked. I lost at least three pairs of socks to the unspeakable rockings that occured in that theater. We didn't win, but we did well, and the two shows that did do go on deserved it. I only wish Weaver could've taken both their shows on; both Girl, Interrupted and Godspell. They both were incredible (Godspell made me cry I was so happy...I AM such a wimp), but Girl, Interrupted moved on. Thats OK, though, it was an equally good show. We did get and honorable mention  for best ensemble work, and I got an honorable mention for best actor (whether I deserved it or not). There were good shows, bad shows, and shows where the best things were corn dogs. I learned that a corporal in the army can take 5 shots, one of which in the back, before dying, and that a play based on other plays such as Shakespeare's plays (we had two of those), aren't necessarily good.  *pant, pant* Wow, that was a long sentence.   In the hotel Conner, Phil and I held the testosterone olympics. (perhaps pictures later) I really enjoyed the trip overall, even with the bite marks all over my arms and shoulders...heh. Everyone did incredibly well, especially with our 'superior' set and 'excellent' lighting. heheh. Well...  *clickety, zap*  check out  urlLink Condog's Blog  for a complete, and completely true (mostly) overview of the goings-ons on....the...trip...damn.  There are so many people that got totally cheated by not getting awards at this competition. Phil, Conner, Mary Kate, Jill...all should have been greatly awarded with greatness. And that makes me feel bad that I got something and they didn't. But, I have to admit I am happy I got something. Yeah...  Oh, and Conner, the multi-colored phallus was stolen...or lost...or both. That sounded really wrong.  paece out, brudda nine-nine...

        Feeling Tingly   Have you ever felt really tingly all over when your listening to a soft song? I did. It felt like needles poking me all over my body, but it didn't hurt, it felt good, and I was overcome with joy: almost to the point of crying. All my thoughts and concerns disappeared: I was floating in happiness. I felt like I could fly on a gust of wind. All of a sudden I could think clearly about deep things, unrestrained by any physical cares. It was totally like what enlightenment must feel like. I realized how petty and crude many people are. I was...happy. Truly happy for the first time in a while.  wow...  that felt really good.  I really have no more stress. I need to spend more time thinking about the present than worrying about the future. That is the key to true happiness: live in the moment. But be sparing; in this life if you never look ahead, you will hit a proverbial brick wall. A paradox. Hmm...meditation is good.   Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string.   keep rockin' Emerson my man...  I don't care what anybody says, Vertical Horizon rocks the planet to the core and no one can truthfully say otherwise.

        Ever had that feeling your being watched? No? Damn.   A while has passed but nothing has changed.  The play competition is this weekend and we're gonna rock their socks off! Leaving Thursday and staying through Saturday. 48 hours of play. It's going to be awesome.  Also,  "I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions."    "A great man is coming to eat at my house. I do not wish to please him: I wish that he should wish to please me"   ...rock on Emerson, rock on.  A man is walking down a road on day and happens upon a man with a burlap sack. The first man says, "whats in the sack?" The 2nd man answers, "chickens. I'm gonna make me some chicken for dinner." The 1st man says, "MMM...chicken. I wish I had some chickens." The 2nd man says, "I tell yer what. Ya guys how many chickens are in this bag, and you can have them both."  Well,  I  thought it was funny.

        Break? whew...   It's Christmas (yes, Christmas, not x-mas) break time. Finally. Didn't think I would make it. But I did, so there.  I have 10,000 faces. All are in a constant war for control. As soon as one grasps the seat of power and controls my mindset, another supplants it makes its filthy existence through me. There is one face though, that lies deep down, long-defeated, long-dead, burried under mounds of trampled dirt on the battlefield. Its name is Tim. And it will never see the light of day ever again.  I can't be me. Years of subconscious self mental conditioning has seen to this. Damn my childhood. Damn it to Hell.  JD and Martha, you are both wonderful people. You are so happy together. I see these "relationships" others have where they are in a constant state of questioning, "Does he/she still like me?" You two don't have that. You don't need to be in constant state of wonderment (yes its a word), because you both know that you love each other. You two have the dream relationship, and I am happy for you.  Reading Mary Kate's blog I wonder to myself; is the key to happiness and to overcoming self-doubt is a love relationship. It makes more sense the more I think about it.  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..................................

        But I'm still alone.   Ever feel that your alone, even though your surrounded by friends and family? That you're somehow...incomplete? I don't know why, but thats the way I feel tonight. I'm sorry, but this is going to be a self-pity rant. It's my blog; deal. I'm the kind of person that, even though I try my hardest not to, am always worried about what others think of me. I don't like that. At all. But that's the way I am. And because of this, I am constantly questioning myself and my friends. I am always worried that people talk about me badly behind my back, or they are being friendly to me out of pity. I don't want to believe it, but I can't help it. I feel like I am alone, never really fully accepted into any 'group'. And just when I do feel accepted, someone does something or says something that again makes me question my standing in others' eyes. I HATE IT! WHY DO I CONSTANTLY HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT SUCH THINGS!!! I don't like being the teddy bear. Well, kinda...just a little.  Well, that's over...I guess.  Exams start tomorrow...eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die. Klingon Tim: It is a good day to die! Insecure Tim: I don't want to die. Confident Tim: I will do fine. Realist Tim: No you won't.  I was talking to some people a few days ago, and they were convinced that if two people went out on a 'date', that they were officially 'going out' or 'together'. Since when? Can't two friends go out on a purely non-romantic 'date', just as friends? Since when has going to dinner and a movie with one other person automatically mean you're 'together'. So if I were to go with a friend that is a guy to pizza and then to see a movie, does that automatically make us gay? Does it mean we're going out? No! This whole institution of unspoken rules of social interaction is complete bull shit. Why does the word 'date' have so many unspoken connotations behind it? Being born into society with all its bullshit is worse than being born deaf, dumb, and blind. Because at least then you would think for yourself.  grrrr...  Congrats to JD and Martha, they are so happy and so cute together, and I am very happy for them!  That said, goodnight.

Or those people that bend spoons with their minds? Are they really transcending planes, or are they instead changing the perspectives themselves and others? And if everyone sees it move, does it really move?  That's not ujmjnjy katy stop ffgnjystop why? because. thatssoi? i cant tpe. my face has more pockets than a magician. pooh2wahoo  ok, so thats over.  jmkumjhxnhim trying to be serious now katy! db grgdamn it STOP!!!

But just a few days ago, he had a seizure and they found a few lumps in his brain. he's getting brain surgery soon, so everyone pray/keep him in your hearts so that he may feel good and be healed soon.

        NEWSFLASH!!   I wear the same thing every single day. I wear socks with sandles. I don't wear cologne. I am overweight. My parents divorced when I was ten. I have two houses that I live in, but no home. I am overwhelmed by school and society. I have had thoughts of suicide. I have had extremely violent thoughts. I have been confused. I have been walked on. I have been persecuted for my beliefs. I have been told I am nothing but property. I mean nothing until I'm eighteen, yet I am expected to one day give to this society. I have witnessed terrible things. I have been lied to by my loved ones. I have been rejected. I have cried. I live in the wealthiest, most powerful country in the world. I'm told that myself and my generation are to lead this country in the future.           .........thanks for the childhood, assholes.

        Dear Diary....jackpot.   Yeah, I'm psychic. I can't see or hear or read other's minds, but I definitely have a fairly strong sixth sense. Songs pop into my head, and when I turn on the radio, they're playing. This morning in Seminary, I was thinking of a certain scripture and my teacher happened to be writing that exact same scripture on the board. It's the little things, too numerous to be coincidence, but to uncontrolled to be an actual skill. It's cool. Sometimes. Not when my dreams come true though. That never turns out well.  Yeah, blogs are becoming dangerous. VERY dangerous. Certain people have discovered other certain people's blogs, and that didn't go very well. We will see hw theat works out.

        [error 539] -//missingcatch-phrase//   So, I was eating breakfast this morning, and I discovered something; Life gets soggy in milk. And then it tastes bad. There is something profound in that, but I have yet to grasp it. Possible moral: beware of milk. nah.  Well, I am much happier. Things are going very well overall, and I'm kinda over my lonely, love-searching mode. Just gave up. Figure it'll pop back up at the right time. It's cool. Ice cold. School is also going better, even though theres a lot of work coming up. But I look to the future, yet I live in the present; search to discover your home before your neighbors'.  File sharing is at an all time high and the RIAA seems to have given up. hehe. Freedom of music.  Saw Big Fish. It made me cry. I want to die just like that. Everyone be happy. I'd keep smiling to my grave and beyond. Beyond. Far beyond.  Someone asked me why I believe in God. My answer is why not. If the universe is infinitely big, then I am infinitely small, and since that is the case, it is conforting to believe in a infinitely powerful friend, especially a father, that is there to help and protect you. What if I die and find there is nothing? Then I'm no worse off, am I? If there is nothing, it doesn't matter if I believed in God, or partied my life away: there's nothing. So basically for those who don't believe, think of it as a failsafe; if I belive in God and stay true to his teachings and then die and find there is a God, then I'm cool. Ice cold. If I die and there is nothing, oh well. At least I lived a good, productive life.  Bt-Somnabulist Simply be loved is more than enough.  transcending all planes of understanding to find its all a facade, a fake, a fraud. put in place by no one but ourselves to hold us back from the true meaning of us. we. everyone. going crazy in a bubble of perception as we laugh at others' misfortune. Psycotic. No. Misdirected. Maybe. Dangerous. Very. Finding a place for the soul, to keep it safe in the jaws of a lion, hold it over a cliff, knife to the throat, gun to the head. Smiling in the darkness that only lasts till dawn, only to be followed by darkness once more. till the sun wears out and perpetual darkness falls on us all for eternity. but we'll be dead, so it doesn't matter. only our minds will remain in the bubbles, laughing at others' pain.

        Sometimes I just wanna cry...   The human body is so frail. Life can be ripped away in an instant, but it takes years for the scars to heal. Sometimes they never do. My heart goes out to those people. The lonely and the heartached.  This life is just a drop in eternity, yet we have the power to influence so many drops that we can change the course of eternity. Make it better.  Thanks Martha. Your right, I do need to smile more. I'll try.  I've just lost sight of everything important recently, and I'm trying to find my bearings.

        News flash in the news? Not while I'm around!   Ok, I just got back from my  second  Christmas trip and all I could think about is wanting to go home. But it was a fun trip.  When we got home we found a nice little Christmas suprise; somebody broke into our house. The dead bolt was ripped out of the back door and the house was basically pillaged. They went after my mom's jewelry (they got her wedding band that she had left here for the holidays) and they stole our ps2, games, etc. I'm not mad about it, I'm just scared. Someone was in our house without our permission, without us knowing. I never thought that would happen in my neighborhood. I don't care about the stuff that was stolen, I'm just glad that they didn't harm our cats. cute kitties...  It is strange though. I know they were in my room. The pillows on my bed were thrown everywhere and a few other things. I had left my laptop on my desk, out in the open and they didn't take it. didn't even touch it. Hm..perplexing.  The police dusted for fingerprints and didn't find any. They think these were professionals.  I just feel so sad and angry that someone would do that. I hope that someday that they will realize their mistakes and stop what they're doing.  Ahh...oh well. No use crying over spilt milk...or broken door in this case.///

        Dreams, its whats for dinner.   Dreams are the coolest thing in the world. The coolest things ever. The fact that your brain works while your asleep, being able to come up with totally original ideas and actually  LIVE  them is totally amazing.  I had one of the most memorable and vivid dreams I ever had last night. It really had no definite meaning, but it made me laugh and opened me to new emotions. I created a world in my head. I experienced things that I had never experienced before; nothing perverted, just things I want to keep to myself for now because they seem to special and real. Real.  It made me want to be a better person so that I can experience those things again. For real.  Know real. Live real.

        Hello? God? Yeah, thanks for being there...:`-)   Had a really cool 'discussion' with my dad tonight. It has always been tough seeing as my dad doesn't approve of my religion. It is always awkward when religion comes up seeing as we have such different views on things. One such issue is that I have decided to serve a two year mission for my church after high school. My dad has slowly tried to talk me out of this over the years, and its really hard when I have decided to do it and my own father doesn't support it. Anyway, my dad doesn't only disagree with my decision, but he also does not believe that I'm ready to "sell" my religion to others. He says "you need to try other brands to make sure the one your selling is the right one." Sure, ok, but what if I know my religion is completely true? I respect other religions: many have very interesting ideologies and truths, but I know mine it totally true. I'm sorry if that sounds arrogant. Then we talked about how I knew, and I got into direct personal revelation from God through prayer, and then he  told  me that I cannot tell revelation from personal biases and opinions that have been  brainwashed  into me since I was a child. He then preceded to tell me how my religion tried to keep people from asking questions. He told me how my church works. He's never been to my church. How does that work? It is totally not true; I question my faith all the time and ask questions galore at church, all of which are answered in a straightforward, acceptable manner. I rather pride my religion on its openness to questions. But my father told me a was a mindless follower because I did not read the same books he has read. These books openly bash my religion and all that it is based on and the facts in them has been proven totally false. Still,  I  am a zombie mind slave.  Sorry if that didn't make sense. It's late. But I hope you get my point. I got to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, also known as the Mormons. Just in case anybody didn't know.  And I should have used different wording: it is not  my  religion, rather the religion I practice.

Cool.  It's not sentence fragmentation, it's Cataloguing! ;-)  So....yeah.  I need something to do at coffee house. Maybe I'll write something. Maybe I'll just find something. Bah. Also I need to learn a song for tryouts. A good one.  So yeah. My mind is mush. And my face has more pockets than magician. duh

        Do Wah Diddy   So the musical is tomorrow, and I think it's going to be really good. Our last few dress rehearsals have been great. I'm anxious for it to be over (because I'm WAY behind in my schoolwork), but it's kind of bittersweet. This will be my last show with Mary Kate and Phil (most likely ever), and that is incredibly sad for me. I love both of them as very dear friends, and I will miss them when they go. But I hope they come back to visit!  So...  On a happier note, I've found the cure to my year-long battle with mediocrity. I need to stop repressing myself and just be who I am and not regret my mistakes. I need to grow up. I need to learn. I want to be respected for who I am as I respect others. I want to be in complete control of my life. Guess that isn't a happier note.  But I am happy....

        I don't want to be a dumbass...   OK, so I heard this guy the other day who was talking about world issues. He was extremely opinionated and said something to the effect of 'anyone who doesn't have an opinion on today's issues is a dumbass.' I don't want to be a dumbass. So I figure I might as well get my opinions out there. First of all:  War in Iraq- umm...I don't think it was justified in that senior presidente lied to us. He knew there weren't any weapons of mass destruction. That said, I'm glad there is one less maniacal dictator out there. Do I think it was worth American lives? Well, taking into account all the people Saddam would have killed and the tradition his sons would have carried on, yes I do. It would be better if  no one had to die , but the fewer the better; all lives, Iraqi and American, are equal.  Should we withdraw troops?- I think we need to clean up our act. We aren't making any friends over there, and we are making enemies, but I fear that if we pull out now, it leaves the country susceptible to another maniacal dictator to take Saddam's place.  On a closer note, gay marriage- I often get smashed for my views here, but here we go. I believe there are some eternal rights and wrongs. I do not believe that homosexuality is right. I do not think it is natural.  BUT  I DO NOT THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REGULATE MARRIAGES. The government builds our roads, so they can set traffic laws. They can regulate what they give us, but they did not give us the practice of marriage, so they cannot regulate it. Marriage is a completely religious affair, so let the churches decide whether or not to marry gay couples. I think gay couples should receive all the same rights as married couple do under the law (tax reductions or whatever). Again, I do not believe homosexuality is right, but I do not facilitate any hate towards gay people. I have known many gay people and they were wonderful people! I just don't believe some of their decisions to be correct. But that's the beauty of life! We are free to do what we want! Free agency man... rock on!  Well, thats all the stuff I'm gonna talk about right now. I'll write more later.  Anyway, TV Turnoff week is coming up April 19-25. I plan to participate ( i watch way too much TV) I encourage all to participate as well.  I wonder, we try to embrace the stars, yet we're afraid to embrace the person sitting next to us. Why do we search for extra-terrestrial life when we don't fully understand ourselves or our planet? We should understand ourselves and the world around us so that when we find those aliens, we will really have something to share with them: life.

        Imagine if you will...   You are walking down a street in Tokyo, Japan. To you, being an avid fan of anime in the US, this is utter nirvana. You are taken aback by the booming, neon-light filled metropolis. Ah, it is amazing. You decide to find a comic shop and pick up some DVD's of your favorite anime 'FLCL' because they're so freaking expensive in the US. So you go over to a helpful looking Japanese man dressed as a roll of sushi to advertise for a new restaurant, and ask him where you can find 'FLCL' (pronounced 'furikuri'). He changes from his happy self from just a moment before and looks in utter horror at you. He stutters, "F....F...F....FURIKURI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" You think, 'what the hell?' Then the cry is repeated by another behind you, then another further down the street. Eventually the cry is heard all over the city as the people on the streets rush for cover in the buildings. Even the people on the cars pull their cars over to the side of the road and run for cover as well. You are left alone on the street, utterly stunned. A piece of paper blows by in the wind. There is a dead silence. Then slowly, in the distance you hear a small motor sound. And it gets closer. And closer. In the distance you see a small yellow speck on the horizon, followed by a river of dust. The dot gets bigger and bigger. THen you realize you need to run. Fast. Your feet will hardly move, but you get them to run anyway. you look back over your shoulder to see what is behind you, and you are shocked to your core: it's a yellow vespa being rode by a pink haired alien wielding an electric guitar like a broadsword coming right at you screaming at the top of her lungs. You think, 'this is it, I'm gonna die! I only wish I could have gotten those DVD's!'  BANG!!!WHACK!!DONG!!!!*crash**roll**blackout*  Moral of the story: never ask about FLCL in Japan. It hurts. A lot.

        Heheh...I'm going to Hell for laughing at this...   HOLLYWOOD, CA—After watching Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ Monday, Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ announced that He will demand creative control over the next film based on His life.    Above: Christ pans Passion after seeing it at a North Hollywood multiplex.   "I never should have given Mel Gibson so much license," said Christ, the Son of God. "I don't like to criticize a member of the flock, but that close-up of the nails being pounded into My wrists—that was just bad."   Our Lord did not limit His criticisms to Gibson's Passion; He expressed frustration with historical inaccuracies in numerous film adaptations of His life.   "There have been a lot of films based on My life, and pretty much all of them have gotten it wrong," Christ said. "Just look at Godspell—what the heck was going on there? It's time I reclaim My image."   Christ said He considered returning to the physical world to make an accurate film depiction of His life for years, but seeing The Passion prompted Him to finally descend from heaven, meet with His agent Ronald Thatcher, and demand that He be attached as a producer on any future projects.   "Ron has a history of telling Me that the filmmakers 'totally understand' the Word Of God, and that the project is going to be 'fabulous,'" Christ said. "But when it comes out, it's all wrong, and Ron claims everything fell apart in post-production. At that point, there's nothing left for Me to do but say, 'Okay, fine. I forgive you all.' Well, next time, I'll be shepherding the project through from casting to final edit to marketing."   Describing one of His biggest complaints, Christ said that no film about His life has ever "made the apostles pop."   "In The Greatest Story Ever Told, the 12 are basically interchangeable," Christ said. "Directors get the piety, but they don't bring out the personalities behind the agape love. Some of those guys were real cut-ups, you know. Simon Peter could make you laugh until you cried tears of blood."   In order to bring these and other truths to light, Christ teamed up with screenwriter Ron Bass, who wrote both Snow Falling On Cedars and My Best Friend's Wedding. The two have been co-writing a high-concept script, temporarily called Untitled Jesus Project.   "We're still hammering out the treatment, but I'm really excited about where it's headed," Christ said. "It really beefs up My relationship with John the Baptist, something all of the other movies missed. They always put in the beheading, but they leave out the quiet moments when John and I would hang out, eat locusts and honey, and talk about the redemption of Man. I think our friendship will really resonate with a lot of viewers."   Christ said He is also working on a heist film based loosely on the loaves-and-the-fishes incident, but that the project is currently stuck in development.    Above: Christ talks with directors on the set of an upcoming cable-TV miniseries about His life.   "I tend to have problems pitching to studio executives," Christ said. "Last week, I appeared in a vision before a D-girl at Sony, and I said, 'Be not afraid, for I am Jesus—I have written a treatment and Matthew McConaughey is interested in the role of Herod.' Apparently, she was a little freaked-out by the vision and she ended up passing on the idea. Ron said that next time I should just schedule a lunch meeting like everyone else."   Returning to film adaptations about His life and Word, Christ said some inaccuracies can be traced back to the source material, the New Testament.   "Remember, at the time the Good Book was written, I was running around saving souls like a madman," Christ said. "I couldn't focus on a writing project, too. I basically gave My team of writers the broad strokes and hoped inspiration would fill in the cracks. Now, I'm not saying the New Testament isn't good—it is. It's great! But by the time I got around to reading the galleys, the monks had already finished the first printing."   The Lord Jesus did have positive things to say about Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation Of Christ.   "Not only is Marty a fantastic director, but the story isn't the same old, same old," Jesus said. "It's like The Gospel of Mark filtered through an episode of The Twilight Zone. I love it. My one problem is with the casting of Willem Dafoe. He's good, but I think John Turturro would have made a better Me."   In spite of His love for Scorsese, Christ said He has no plans to simply make "the next Last Temptation."   "My movie about My life will be the greatest movie ever shown," Christ said. "It should be the last Word on Me. No more animated versions, no more musicals, and no more movies where the scourging scene is so violent, you could put it in Fangoria. I mean, yes, being crucified is very painful. But I can't see devoting more than, say, three minutes of film to it."   Jesus added: "My version will have it all: drama, laughter, a spiritual message, and a couple of twists that will surprise even the most devout. The best part is that it'll be 100 percent accurate."   Continued Christ: "Even with the top-notch screenplay Ron and I are writing, I'll still need a great director to make the script shine. Unfortunately, Gore Verbinski is already committed to Pirates Of The Caribbean 2. If only he'd see that this movie is truly the career path for the righteous, I'd be able to get a firm commitment from Johnny Depp, too. Let us pray."  That's from the Onion.  It's funny how they capitalized the pronouns.

        Indiana Jones + Iron Will + Lawrence of Arabia + Every Cowboy Movie Ever Made = Hidalgo   So here's the scoop. There's an upcoming film festival at school and we need people to get into it, so I'm going to (hopefully) make a "preview" movie for Monday Morning Meeting, which will probably consist of me making a complete fool of myself in my struggle to fit several genres into about 30 seconds. But it'll be good for a laugh. So...  So....life has been strange lately. It's neat having a baby around the house, but it's also a lot o work. But thats boring stuff...not gonna write about that.  There's a story in there somewhere...Oh THERE IT IS!!!....no, no that was a guy in a gorilla suit....damn gorilla suit...  I'm sorry about that last post, just ignore it. I'll deal with it. ....but then why did I bring it up again?  I want my dreams to come true. Not really my day dreams or hopes, but the dreams I have while I am asleep. They're the best things ever. Either that or dream forever.  I've been thinking about trying out for Ensemble next year, but there are a couple of things holding me back. The first is time commitment, and the second is that if I got in, would I really be an assett or would I just hold back somebody else who could of used the spot more? I love acting, but it's not really what I plan to do with my life. I feel that if I made it, I may take the spot of someone who could really take advantage of the training to build a career upon.  hmmm.......teenage social life is too complex, especially with school in the mix. But teenage social life wouldn't be so large if it weren't for school, would it?  //signoff

        Eating ice cream and listening to Cake   So, today was full. I got ice cream. I registered to vote. I got my tux (snazzy). I ran out of gas. (my own dumb fault) My faith in the kindness of strangers was reaffirmed.  Yeah, my car was acting screwy all day. Then it stopped acting screwing and, well....stopped. Next to a bunch of condos on Colony Rd. I sat there, called Katy for a ride (who by the way is a wonderful friend), and while I was sitting, a nice older guy came out and asked if I was alright. I explained that my car didn't go and he checked it out. apparently I was out of coolant and the guy happened to have some. He filled it up, but it still didn't start. So when Katy got there we pushed the car back into a parking lot. Then the guy suggested that I use his gas can and go get some gas. Katy drove us to the gas station, got some gas, filled my truck and, uh, it started. So cool. I thought my car broke, but it didn't. So yeah.  It was the kindness of that guy that was so cool. A complete stranger offering to help. He didn't even accept money for the coolant. Random acts of kindness are great.  In DC there is a George Bush Center for Intelligence. Heh.  *poof*

        A sunday morning where you wake up and it's raining.   So Big 'ol freakin Saturday was cool...I guess. But something was decided today that will hopefully change the course of next year. Which will be cool. An apartment. Heh.  The Japanese can rock and roll. Ride on shooting star.   urlLink This  graphic short story is cool. It made me feel good.  I flew in my dream the other night. It was very neat, and remembering back I believe I was almost lucid. I want to fly again...  JD and I finished the song dubbed 'funxxor' (remember the 'n') the other night. It's good, but I want to add more. Two minutes s not long enough. But it's rocking so far. I think the next song will be a little middle eastern. It will rock as well.  I wonder...  Prom is in one week. I'm looking forward to it very much; it should be very fun!  Till then (but hopefully before)

        Sorry, it's a biggin'   It’s a funny question. What do I believe in? The usual things, I suppose. I believe in love, and its ability to change the world if given the chance. I believe in freedom. I believe in supporting beliefs, no matter how unbelievable they are. I believe in acoustic guitars and electric basses. And hip-hop drums. I believe that music can change a heart and lift a soul. I believe in eternal families. I believe that aliens are out there and the whacks on the street foretelling the end of the world are right. The world is ending. I believe that. I believe that only I can prevent forest fires. I believe in many gods, but I worship God. I believe that friends can be more dear to each other than they are to their own right hands. I believe in many things. I believe that God has a sense of humor, and that He exercises it daily. And yes, I believe God is a man. No, I don’t believe that sexism is right. No, I don’t believe saying God is a man is being sexist. He just is. I don’t believe that makes men any better or women any worse; I believe we are equal in God’s eyes (physically). I believe in waffles, and all their fluffy goodness. I believe in government conspiracies (or at least corrupt postal workers). I believe in immortality, and that everybody will reach it some day. I believe in color changing t-shirts, and that the people that wear them are crazy. I believe that choosy moms choose Jif. I believe in 5 different colors of pasta. I believe in the physical expression of love, and that it should not be frowned upon by anybody towards anybody anywhere anytime. I believe that my vote counts and that I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I believe in 2 foot long sausages (don’t ask). I believe I can fly. I believe I can touch the sky. I believe in an ever-expanding Universe. I believe in an infinite number of Universe-es. I believe that mankind ( or womankind, or humankind) is smaller than just a pimple on a pimple on a pimple on the ass of a giant who is small for his age compared to the other giants that make up the Universe, but I believe that if we all jump at once we can move that giant and thus the others. I believe what I am trying to say is that I believe that as insignificant as we humans are that if we work together we can change the cosmic course of events that started however many hundreds of billions of years ago. I believe in rambling sentences, and that everyone should use them. I believe in believing in something so strongly (or loving something so much) that you’d be willing to die for it. I believe in 31 individual flavors of ice cream. I believe in social activists and corporate shits. I also believe in corporate heroes. I believe in writing and its therapeutic properties and its way of getting one’s ideas out there and its openness to all. I believe that the RIAA can shove it unless they pay the artists more than they pay their CEO’s. I don’t believe in copyrights, but I do believe in giving credit to people for their brainchildren. I believe that one day a basket of wheat will be worth more than a basket of gold. I believe in the end of days, the apocalypse, Armageddon. I believe in happy endings, but I believe that things have to get bad before they get better. I believe that the media is eating away US citizen’s constitutional rights without opposition and without the US citizens even noticing. I don’t believe in proofreading this (but I will anyway). I believe I’ve said everything here exactly as I meant it to be said. I believe in video games. I believe that even geeks can come out on top: win the battle, get the girl (or guy), live happily ever after. I believe in fighting for your rights, your liberty, your freedom, and your beliefs. I also believe in not discriminating others’ beliefs, but if that’s your belief then well…that’s a paradox. A pair-of-docks. I believe in alchemy and magic and other shit that should not be messed with, but is cool to make movies and books about. I believe that everyone has something eternal in him or her or it that has always been around and always will be. And now, I believe I am done writing.

        So...uhh...   I recant my disowning of love.  that was short lived...  So, the film festival was INCREDIBLE!! The turnout was awesome. I totally did not expect so many people, but they were most definitely welcome. The place was fancied up, and we even got a popcorn machine. It was freakin awesome. Then after cleanup, we went down to Caribou. Had a load of fun there.  So, its time to look for colleges. The search begins. My first trip is going to be to Richmond VA. Richmond looks like a great school on paper, just what I'm looking for: small liberal arts college, great looking spacious campus, not a huge greek presence but an existent one, cool city by what I hear, good student reviews. I want in no way to limit my choices, but Richmond looks pretty cool. But we'll see.  So that's what I got. I feel much better.

Are you currently in a relationship? not for real, plenty of joke relationships (ahh...my dear Joe) .. Are you in love? .............................................................I don't know .. Do they love you back? I have no idea.  All of These Clothes and Nothing To Wear!  .. Do you wear brand name clothing? uh, yeah... .. Do you wear it because it's brand name? not at all .. Then why do you wear it? because it's comfy and I think it looks cool (but I won't sacrifice comfort for cool) .. Do you know how to tie a tie? a half-windsor, I used to know the full windsor (double windsor?), but I forgot .. A bow tie? no .. Ever gone anywhere with no underwear? um, I think I did once in like kindergarten .. How about to church with no underwear? not that I recall .. Do you wear jewelry? a watch and a wristband, but I don't think of it as jewelry, really .. When you take off your shoes, do you untie them? I wear sandals, so no .. What's your favorite color? almost any shade of blue .. What's your favorite holiday? Christmas, because there's just that jolly air to everything .. Have you ever thought seriously about committing suicide? yeah (I'd never do it though), but who hasn't at some point? .. Have you ever tried to commit suicide? nope .. Would you ever bungee jump? yeah, I have before; it's really fun .. Sky dive? yeah, sure, why not? .. What are you worried about right now? school, social life, worried about making the high school memories that it seems everyone is supposed to have.

        I feel dead   I can't take this twisted emotion. It should make me happy, but it makes me insane, depressed.  I must be broken.

        It may be touching, but I'm out of touch.   So from here on out I am disowning love and the pursuit thereof indefinitely. It's just too much of a hassle. I'm tired of looking for it, and it's tired of running from me, so this is for the best of both of us.  No just to grow to be an angry, crazy, lonely old man and my life will be perfect.  Damn it, I don't want these emotions anymore! Take them away! I HATE them! I want it to be over... but they'll always be there haunting me, making me question every move I make. Making the simplest social interactions into embarrassing, awkward encounters. Someone take these feelings away! I want to be normal again. It's like a disease! A mental disease. I wouldn't even know what to do with love if it fell in my lap. I was raised around the ideals of broken relationships. All of my significant role models have failed in one part of their life; love. So maybe it's not for me. It only makes me angry and stupid.  charged 100%  I've lost control of the only thing I've ever had control over. School. My last line of defense against the mass meaningless-ness is gone, and I'm going under. Here's where I let out my stream of expletives (yet another habit that makes me meaningless).  Foot that bill. Kill Bill.  My family is full of empty dreams of what is my life, making speculation on things that are simple and plain. I hate them.  No, dad, it's not like that.  My mom  tiptoes around me like I'm a ticking time bomb that could explode in rage at any moment. She blames me; I'm 17. On the contrary, I say it is her that will explode in a fiery hell of rage like napalm (it only spreads the more you try to put it out). But I'm 17. It's hormones. Damn the hormones. But it's also the thought. I'm thinking for myself for the first time in my life, and my parents can't let go. They say I'm not mature enough to make major decisions, but I am economically responsible for myself. I have to pay for everything from what I make at the job I don't have. yet.  When I turn 18 (aug...oh God it can't come fast enough) I want to get an apartment and live on my own. No more of this switching houses, never sleeping the same place twice bullshit. I want ONE place to stay. But again, apartment requires money which I do not have.  It's too much to free my soul. I'll just end up killing time. That's my life.  Skittles and water = life is good ...?... I'll need a scientific proof.  I need a shoulder to cry on. that is if I COULD cry. I haven't cried in so long, I feel that I have lost any sympathy/empathy/happiness I ever had. but it doesn't really matter in the end.   THE END

        I only mean 25% of what I say   Yeah, my head hurts. Like a lot. I don't know if it's allergies or what, but OUCH!  I feel immature. Sometimes when I'm talking to people, I say things that I instantly regret and think, 'wow, what a stupid/inappropriate/unneeded thing I just said.' But then later I feel better.  I doodled some things today, and I like them. I need to draw more often, cuz I love it.  I really did intend this to be longer...

        Get ready for the geekiness!   Argh, Intro to Computer Programming is useless! I should have taken AP Comp Sci this year. I would actually LEARN to program in that class. But it would be in Java. Which sucks. It's possible to write a program in Java and compile it into a Cocoa application (for Max OS X, which I wish to eventually code for), but I read that doing so isn't so great. They are slow (thanks the freaking JVM memory hogging), cumbersome, and rather confusing (because some commands work, and some don't). AAAARRRRGGGHHHH! I want to learn Objective-C in class! Ideally learn it using Xcode (Apple's development utilities), but since CCDS is completely anti-mac, that's extremely unlikely. Guess I'll have to learn it on my own. But then there also aren't any books that teach objective-c as applied to Xcode. grrrrrr....  Ugh, the geekiness.

        I had a great topic, BUT...   When I was small, I thought the sun and the moon followed me. When riding in the car, I knew we were moving, but the sun and/or moon always stayed in the same place in respects to the car. Not understanding perspectives and such, I assumed that these celestial orbs were moving along in the sky along with me. It didn't really scare me, but made me feel special. I thought out of all the people in the world, these things chose ME to follow. It instilled me with cool. But now I know better.  STAY COOL. ;-/

        Weirded out headphones   My haedphones ( I misspelled that on purpose) are held together with electrical take. I need to fix them. With duct (not duck) tape.  I'm 17, and I already have wrinkles in my face and bags under my eyes, a back and feet that hurt each night, and a cynical view of the world. I'd hate to see me when I'm 40, but unfortunately, I'll be living with me then, so there's no real escape.  I want to learn to play the guitar (gee-tar).  Adiemus makes me feel distant. I love the feeling.  Everyone and Anyone; I  LOVE  you. I'd hug you if I could.  I don't want to move on. I still have one more year of school, but it feels like these past three years have been quicker than a heartbeat, and there is still so much more I want to do, say, learn, think, achieve, love. But next year is it. After that, we all go our separate ways. Likely never to see each other again, except perhaps for the reunions where we all get together and realize how old we've gotten, and what we've missed. Life is cruel in that way. I just got into the swing of things, I've only just made friends, and then next year; *poof* Life: "sorry, you've got to start over" very scared me: "*gulp**tear* I'll...go silently..."  But I won't go silently.  Why can't I be honest  and  sincere? Why can't I be who I want to be instead of who I am. Or is who I want to be me and what I am what I want to be? Or... why?  I once got my palm read when I was small. I was told that, according to the lines in my hand, I was to grow up to do something I loved to do for my job. That's all that was said. I want a clue now... what am I supposed to do?  I 6r00v3 l1|  Huh, this post is getting long. SO STOP READING ALREADY. This isn't for you, it's for me. Selfish, but true!  I feel like I've wasted my life playing video games, and not focusing on my talents. Now that I am beginning to discover my talents, they are diminished to frightened squirrels in the corner of a room they got stuck in after jumping of a windowsill in search for food. They stoop in the corner, hissing and bearing their teeth at the huge creatures that mean them no harm. I want to feed the squirrels. Then let them go.  I haven't gone star watching in a long time. I miss it. Maybe I could climb onto the roof through my brother's window. That would be awesome.  Why am I up this late? I need energy to fix my car tomorrow. It will be literally held together with wood. A wooden car. Alright.  Now I'm off to find those squirrels. Love, (this word is not used enough)  tim

       I want that blissful ignorance back. I was sitting today and I realized something: It is gone. I will not have it back in this lifetime. No longer can I worry just about being the first to the blocks at recess. No longer can I ride on my father's shoulders at a baseball game. No longer can I feel that ethereal magic at Christmas time. No longer can I throw snowballs, get hit in the face, run inside to mommy, sit down with cocoa and a hug. No longer can I sit at the front door, nose against the glass watching for daddy's car to drive up. No longer can I be a child.  It is sad. But not too sad. I miss it terribly. There are so many things I wish I could relive. But I suppose recognizing a moment is a defining moment in your life doesn't really matter; in 15, 20, 25, 60 years you'll just wish you could relive them again.  It should be sad. And it is/isn't.  The world is telling me I need to grow up, but do I? Do I really?  So many people I know and have known that I miss and want to tell things I never told them but I'll probably never see them again because I don't even know where they are (mostly) and they probably don't even give my memory a second thought if at all but I love them allthesame and miss them and want to hug them. But I can't. I CAN'T.  I want a someone to cry on. I want a big hug and a long cry  I'm a closet hopeless romantic if I've ever known one.

       I've spent a lot of time with my family recently and I feel happy about it. Yesterday we saw a movie and had dinner together. Then today we went to the pool and had dinner together. Then we watched Scary Movie 3. Together. That's an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back. But the point is that I love my family! Hooray!  I never realized the deeper meaning that was there. I always thought, 'hey, this is funny and mildly entertaining,' but now I see it is a coming of age story. A transition into adulthood (or at least maturity) for a young boy. It's about his first (and second)(maybe a THIRD?!) love and his realization of it. It is his battles, his trials, his struggles. All that and giant robots. Always need the giant robots.  So I says to him...  What would happen if Aphrodite bathed in the river Styx? Would everybody forget they were in love? Or would Aphrodite just forget that she needed to make people fall in love, making future generations suffer through grueling loveless lives? That's one to ponder.  I met a young man at a bus stop dressed in blue. He had his head in his hands and tears in his eyes. I couldn't help but smile.  Imagine you had a sixth sense by which you felt life. You can feel life in the things around you, even in plants. Now imagine being in a grassy field and feeling a sensory overload of that sense. Ahh, that would be wonderful to feel other living things.  He flew into the air. Silhouetted by the sun he hung, seemingly suspended there, with his blade drawn ready to strike. In that instant I saw the man on the ground turn his head and see this feat, I knew that it was over. I could see that he knew it as well. That look on his face when the realization hit that it was too late was horrifying. It was then that this slowed state of time resumed it's normal flow. The suspended warrior flew downwards, blade still raised. The man on the ground barely had enough time to close his eyes. And then he was gone. By some grace of the gods, he was no longer there. The warrior's blade cut air, not flesh. He had done it again, either by skill or chance or divine favor. He would live to see another day. He would live to fight the last fight.  alas...

Did you know you could make a stun-gun out of a disposable camera. So soon camera's will be banned from airplanes along with nail clippers. Yay America! Thanks Osama...  I'm done trying to be artsy. I'm ready to start being.  I loved the Elephant Man. It rocked my socks off, and I've yet to find them. When Conner said it was "a bunch of crippled people dancing around," I thought 'oh great, its gonna be weird.' Well the transitions were, but they freaking ROCKED. I loved it. Oh man.... wow.

       I have a very bad habit of not addressing people by their name. "hey Tim!" "hello!" I say. No name. I apologize to everyone I've done that to. The truth is I have a hard time remembering names, so recall takes longer than a standard greeting should take. So there.  I encourage all to abandon awkwardness. Just choose not to feel awkward. It's really that easy. Just don't let something be awkward and it won't be. I learned that tonight.  I just realized that the seniors truly are gone. This is the first year that I've actually had good friends that were seniors, and now they are, for the most part, gone. Sure, I may see them once or twice more, but... Oh well. I hope we'll stay in touch. probably not, but maybe.  Perhaps I'm just not ready for it yet. Or it's those damnable fates out to twist lives to their own design. Either way, it's like so totally not cool.  Do I really look like samurack jai? I don't think so.  okeeblow. allergies so there.

       I decided to search Google to see if I could find out who I am.  urlLink Apparently , I am a journalist in Sussex, an actor in a really bad horror movie, the head of a small PR firm in the UK, and the Chief Executive Officer of the edaflow Corporation among other things. And I'm only 17. Wow.  I was in the math office the other day with my dad and cousin. After hearing both of them speak, Ms. Griffin said something like, "Tim, are you sure you're related to them? Compared to them, your voice is so... slow." Well, how am I supposed to take that? I know I have a problem with pronunciation and an occasional stutter, but am I slow? And what does that even mean? Ah well...  These allergies are absolutely  killing  me.  Ah, E3. E3 is the annual convention for electronic entertainment (aka VIDEO GAMES). So this convention is when all the major companies make their huge earth-shattering announcements. So it has begun, and already there is a plethora of announcements. Among those were a new Conker game (the world is doomed...), Sega's new MMORPG (massive multiplayer online role playing game) based in the world of the Matrix (whoopee, another way to utterly mutilate what started as a cool, thought-provoking movie), big stuff on Half-Life 2 (finally some progress, that leak of the code last year set them back a huge block of time), MYST IV (wow, will this series ever die? Ah, what am I saying: I love it. Yet I hate it at the same time. I hate it so very much!), and Phantasy Star Universe (again, a series that won't die). Last, but by no means least, Final Fantasy XII (yes thats 12, FF is the series that puts the undying series to shame). Oh, FFXII will be incredible! The newest best feature I've read about is that battles will finally be fought in the same plane as the explore mode. In other words, no more random encounters. Woohoo! Those got really old. Eh.  Eh.  I'm tired and sick. I'm going to bed.

       If I were to die today and someone were to open my head up, one of several things would be found: a grainy old photograph, a smeared painting, or a large ball of what can only be described of as 'fuzzy.'  What I'm trying to say is that my head is and has been in a state of constant fuzz for a good three months now. I cannot think straight and clearly to save my life. Well, maybe for that, but you get my point.  Yesterday I went up to Davidson to pick up my cousin who just finished his second semester there. On my way back, I was going down 77 at about 65mph when a bird flew right across the road. I didn't have any time to react so I hit it. It was horrifying. The thing just popped out of the trees that were 3 feet from the road and went flying right at about headlight level. Ugh... it was horrible. It's the first time I have really killed anything (besides insects). What makes it worse is that when I looked in my rear view mirror right after it happened, I saw a puff of feathers floating to the ground. I am ashamed that I let a laugh escape my lips. This sad act of killing ended in an almost cartoonish occurrence. And I feel awful for finding it even the least bit funny. But I still do, and that's what is even worse.  Today I attended my first Student Senate meeting. The one thing I learned there: the Student Senate actually has no power at all. Not in the slightest. We're just the "middle-men" between the students and the Academic Council (made up mostly of faculty). Nobody has to answer to us, and we have to answer to the faculty. Sucks,  I am way behind in my work and I don't care.

        Sometimes...   Most of the time I act more naive than I really am. I don't let on how much I understand or know. I act more innocent than I am, more timid in the face of "uncomfortable" subjects. I don't know why I do this, but it's like a natural defense mechanism for me.  Or maybe I really am...I don't know...  My car broke down (AGAIN), but this time a well-placed wrench and some pounding with a screwdriver fixed the problem quite nicely. Well for now that is. It's gonna die one day for good. Heh.  So, (there I go again) I'm really not letting school get me down. I'm in burnout mode (have been for the last month) and I have now achieved Ultra Burnout++ mode. HAHAHA! Beat that you soul-devouring, mind-numbers! HAHAHAHAHA! I DON'T FREAKIN' CARE ANYMORE!!  ehrm.. excuse me.  I've caught word that a certain teacher is doing a seek-and-destroy mission on student blogs at school. Here's a kind warning: don't freakin' mess with us. We will have our output/input, therapeutic, record of our lives and you have NO AUTHORITY TO STOP US! That's the first freakin' amendment for crying out loud! We will get out thoughts out there, so don't oppress us. We know more about the internet than you ever will, so we will always be there: stop trying. If you're not mature enough to take criticism from teenagers then fix their complaints or stuff it! I mean really. Don't censor us. We will beat you. We have natural human rights on our side. We will say WHAT we want to say, WHEN, WHERE, and HOW we want to say it. And you can't stop us, so 8'-P  whew...  Now I feel patriotic. So it came up today at lunch what political affiliation I am. My answer is, "I registered to vote under 'Unaffiliated.'" So there it is. I'm unaffiliated (ahhh... it's all in the timing).  Big Lots + Piggly Wiggly + Harris Teeter = Big Wiggly Teeter mgh...hehe  But seriously folks... I got a new book on Saturday. A writing book. I am happy. Blank pages make me happy: so many possibilities.  I added comments, I hope they work. My guestbook has gone the way of NeXT. Poof.  I so wish this was my senior year. I'm old enough to be a senior, I just started school a year late. I think my body clock is set on senior year anyway. I gots the senioritis.  The more I write, the smaller the scrollbar gets.  I'm just rambling now, so feel free to stop reading.  I strive to be the kind of person anyone can depend on as a friend. I want everyone to know, if you need someone to talk to call me. I will try my hardest to be there for you. And I mean anyone. Night or day. If there's something you can't tell anyone but you need to say it out loud, I can keep a secret. I'm here, and I want to be a good friend. I've got more than enough shoulder for just me to cry on. Never feel like there's anything you can't tell me.  I wonder what would happen if those crazy people on street corners prophesying the end of the world were right. And the world ends. Would they become gods and smite us all with the eternal rod of "I told you so"? That would suck. Just keep that in mind next time you call one of those people crazy. They COULD be right.  I want to dance in a park at night with the moon overhead and ambient techno music playing.  So I'm formulating a short story in my head. It's kinda one of those fantastical, medieval thingies. Maybe I'll post it later if I finish it.  My friend Terrell got back in town a few weeks ago from college. I'm happy, but we haven't had a chance to hang out yet. I can't wait for all my other college friends to come home for summer so we can hang out. It'll be like old times...well, not too old. Like last year old.   And several people have said things that disturb me. Perhaps you have mistaken what I have said. I do not hate gay people in any way. On the contrary, I wish I had a friend that was gay just so i could see the world from that point of view. I am insulted that someone thought I hated gay people. I don't hate anyone, especially not for such a trivial reason such as that.  As I said, a blank page is the most frightening thing ever, yet it is also the most pure. It is the prospect of being able to turn that blank page into something beautiful or completely mutilating it that makes it scary. I usually end up doing the latter. I just can't seem to get out onto paper what I say in my head, and when I do, it sounds nowhere as profound as it originally did.  I want to stay out all night this Friday. All night. Charlotte is a really fun place in the early hours of the morning. Such a big, empty city. Gives you a ethereal sense of calm. Driving the empty roads, splashed with their orange lights. It's bliss, utter bliss.  Is there a good star-gazing spot in Charlotte? It seems every place is saturated with light to the point where it blocks out their beauty. I've yet to find a place. The best stars I've ever seen were at the north ridge of the grand canyon. They were amazing. So many, more than I had and have to this day ever seen before. Amazing. And every 15 sec a shooting star blinked in and out of existence. Amazing. I miss that.  And, as is with all things, I must now fulfill my purpose in existence.

        Well, that's not cool!   Apparently our plans have been foiled. Grrr.  Mike, JD, and I had planned to get jobs this summer and next year in order to earn enough money to rent an apartment for senior year. But Country Day has something to say about that.  Apparently, a small corollary in the CCDS student contract says that if a student gets caught living in a residence without a parent or guardian, they are immediately expelled. Even if they are 18. Which confuses me. But its a rule. So grrr...  There goes the chance of the rockingest senior year ever. Oh well.  And Mike's having trouble. Hopefully he will get a scholarship to school next year. If not...well then senior year further diminishes. Mike and I didn't really like each other freshman year, but this year, we're best of friends. It'll suck if he leaves.  Third post within one evening. Heh.

        I had a good title, but...   So, I just had an argument with my father about school. I felt extremely childish, and at one pint I even ended a conjecture, "duh!"  I am so ashamed...heh  So, I'm about 95% repaired methinks. I feel much better. Everything is  urlLink hunky dory . Yes, it is a ph(r)ase.  So, elephant man is next weekend. Looking forward to it. It sure came fast.  So, school is getting rather tedious and seemingly unnecessary. VERY MUCH SO. perhaps it's early onset Senioritis. I can't wait for senior year. That means the next year is college...well not really. But the bad part of school will be over. Which will be cool. ;-D  So, ....so....  So, life is getting too complicated. Socially. Ah, never-mind.  So, why am I starting all these with so?  So, I miss having things to do after school.  So,...

        I don't know what to write.   Prom was amazing. The dancing, the music, it was great. One of the most fun nights of my life. I had a huge amount of fun.  but alas...  I finally said it. I'm glad that I did, but I feel lost at the same time. It was kinda that hope that there was something there that occupied me for the last few months. I played out the scenario a million times in my head, each time knowing there really was nothing there, but keeping hope all the same. I didn't say all the things I wanted to say, but I said enough. And I'm glad of how it went. Honesty. I hope everything that was said was meant. I believe it was.  On the drive home I listened to the same song over and over. It felt right. It sounded how I felt inside. Not upbeat, not sad.... just peaceful. The roads were empty, it was cool, humid, the wind blowing into the car. Oh, goodness.  I wish I could just get over it. I feel so selfish.

       I hate it that that last post was the one that got left at the top for the two weeks I was gone. I'm just be very bipolar at times. No I'm not. Yes I am. No I'm...  My vacation was amazing. Beautiful scenery, slightly less beautiful people [but just ever so slightly ;-)], and fun all around. Glaciers blow my mind.  I met some younger teens (too young) that I "hung" out with. They were cool, but still going through that sex-crazed phase of teenagedom that is rather annoying at times. I did get some self-esteem boosters though: cute, quiet, articulate, mysterious... wow that doesn't seem like me at all. I just didn't say much because I didn't have much to say. end of story.  There was this one girl though who was just slightly younger than me who lives in Bangladesh. We stayed up late talking about India and Nepal and all those incredible places that we had both been. She was incredibly interesting and honestly the most mature teenager I met on that trip.  So I feel good now.  I was in Alaska on the longest day of the year, and the sun didn't go down. Amazingly beautiful. The sun dips behind the mountain called Mt. McKinley known to the natives as Denali (which is a much better name) and rises no more than an hour later on the other side of the mountain. Words cannot describe it's beauty. The 24-hour sunlight screwed up my body clock though, thus it being 2:20 AM and I'm not even tired. Well, maybe a little.  Ever wonder why 'little' is a bigger word that 'big'?  But now I'm back home at last, just to find that my college friends have returned. Now I get to spend a lot of time with them before they leave again. For two years. and that means I'll probably never see them again...  Ah, but that's too sad.  This is old news, but I just saw Donnie Darko and it rocked my socks off. If you haven't seen it, go rent it right now. It's sci-fi, religious, philosophical, comedy, creepy all rolled into one. It covers time travel to the sexuality of smurfs. Well, that's one part they could of left out... (don't really want to think about a smurf gangbang) But really, it's amazing. You have to watch it several times to even begin to grasp the plot. It was a sundance, but it's very much big movie studio quality and then some. The rabbit freaks me out.  So why are you wearing that silly man-suit?

       Wow, I have had to most amazing reoccurring dreams lately. They are amazing. It's just that I can't realize the utter joy and contentment and rightness that I experience in them. Why? Why can't I? I've been a good person, don't I at least deserve that?  There I go. I don't DESERVE anything. Nothing is owed to me. In fact I am the one in debt to the universe for existence. It just seems so unfair that some people can find it so easily and I can't.  But I'd rather not exist right now. So, universe, you can take it back anytime you like.  I want, I want, I want. I sound like such a twit. Such a fucking wimp.  I just feel as if I've missed the mark somehow. I've been waiting instead of searching and that doesn't freaking work! And now I really don't know what to do. Except maybe make me better.  It's strange: I need someone familiar to talk to about all this, but I don't want to talk to someone I interact with daily, because it'll just be weird and I can't take that.  Maybe on the boat. But probably not.  I'm tired of this little freaking switch that goes on whenever it is least convenient. Normal tim --> shoot myself and stick it into my mouth tim. I'm such a loser and I just need someone next to me to say, "no your not" even though it's a lie. And I can't say THIS to anyone because when serious things come up, the little switch flips and I start to fidget and make stupid, insensitive jokes and in general be a nervous ass.  And now even my mother is trying to make me feel guilty. She says I'm a disappointment. She's probably right.  I'm such teenager.... more sad blogging

       If you can tell me something worth fighting for. ... no cliches please... wait, the only things worth fighting for ARE cliche.  I heard someone say recently that only GUYS can be geeks. I want to correct that misconception. Girls can be geeks, most definitely. It just so happens that the general idea of a geek is a mid-puberal fat boy with coke bottle glasses, acne, and a sweater vest. Geeks can be 'cool'. And girls. Hah.  I just realized this is utterly useless and not worth my time or yours.

       thanks for letting me steal Xen. The third CD rocks my world. The other two are good too, but of course I haven't listened to them all.  So, it's 2:40 AM June 2nd, and the Bebop Fest is faltering. JD fell asleep and Mike and Brian are now playing HALO. Not bad. I would go to sleep, but I'm too wired on the caffeine from countless cokes I have ingested in anticipation of not sleeping at all. And now I'm sleepless with a stomach ache. A wise plan... or not. Anyway, the reason for this Bebop Fest which is failing is that school is over. OVER! Last exam today, and I owned it... I think. But it doesn't matter. It is summer and I am now a senior, señior! And now I feel.  ...spaced. space-ed.  We are the newage digital ninjas. We run circles around you with digits and beats and you wonder where you fell of the gravy train. (heh...gravy?) Like ninjas... on fire. (a lollipop to whoever can recognize that reference)  How can speech be so cool?  It's like a geek who can't type... wait, I am a geek who can't type. Heh, well then.  AHHHH Cockroach! leave it be. It just wants the crumbs.  you can probably tell its early.  So would you relive this year if you had the chance? I sure as hell would. Without a second thought. I would've fixed all that went wrong. And a LOT went wrong. But I learned a lot too. Not from school, but through important stuff: life lessons, social interaction, self-awareness/preservation/reservation/meditation/rejuvenation.  And my computers ribbiting at me.

       OK, so this kid set up a wireless router on the floor below me and it makes it into my room, so I get internet access in my room instead of going all the way to the lobby. So I'm posting not.  I met one of my geekhood idols today. Steve Wozniak. The Woz. He gave the intro at today's geek camp plenary speaker, Kevin Mitnick. Mitnick, considered the most wanted hacker of all time, talked to us on internet security and "social engineering." He's paid his dues and his fugitive life is behind him, so he tells us never to do what he did. To summarize, he said, "Don't do what I did, and this is how I did it." And he explains how he did it. So go figure. The whole social engineering thing is amazing, instead of a hacker cracking a network, it is much easier and less trackable to call an emplyee of the target company and trick them into giving you their password. Genius how hacker's apply this.  But back to Woz. I heard him speak, but didn't see him after that. Only the "alumni" were allowed to go up and see the speakers after the plenary. So Tall Paul and I went to lunch with some others. Afterwards we walked back to the hotel. We were in the valet area, and looking at all the cars. Now keep in mind that this hotel is NICE, so all the cars are like convertibles, Ferrari's, BMW's and such. So then we saw this Toyota Prius. We thought, 'that seems kinda out of place' (keep in mind, a Prius is an awesome car, but it wasn't the norm BMW). We walked by it and did a double take: it was the Woz sitting in the driver's seat. It was breathtaking. We talked to Woz, got to take pictures, and then even Mitnick showed up. They were driving to Las Vegas together for Defcon. Very cool.  I'll post pictures later, but for now it's time for dinner.

       I'm at geek camp mooching wireless bandwidth. HEHHE.  I've never seen so many geeks gathered together in one place. And we're in San Jose in a five star hotel! This rocks. My roomies rock. Steve is a true punk and Fred is that kind of silent presence that is just plain cool.  And I'm listening to Steve's Irish Punk. this is great.  Oh, and JD: apparently your conference last year was much to rowdy because this year Apple doesn't want NYLF back, so NO TRIP TO APPLE! blargh.  More later.

       This might sound sad, but it's not. Well, it is. But at the same time its not.  I heard last week that a friend from elementary school died in a car accident (not the old friend I've talked about here before). This was shortly after the death of my cat, Hershey. Then I heard of the CCDS graduate who passed away in a car accident.  I see these as deaths in all three steps of time. The first, an old schoolmate, is my past. The second, my cat, my present. The third, the graduate, my future. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to learn from these deaths. One from my past, my present, and my future. Maybe I'm over-analyzing this, but it is very peculiar that all these deaths happened so close together.  If poetic symbolism holds true, I should soon witness a rebirth of some type.  I just hope I realize it when it comes.  I just hope its not foreshadowing.

       Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.......  I'm still smiling. Big time. It's only been three days, but I already miss talking to her.  Yesterday I met Mary Kate for coffee (even though I don't drink coffee... ironic, eh?) and then went to play dodge-ball with a bunch of North Westenerers (you know what I mean). That was oodles of fun. Except that my arm still hurts from throwing and there is a slight chance that I may never have any kids (ouchies).  Without the pretty pink ribbon, you'd end up just like me.  So I'm going to be out of town for the next three weeks doing various things. It'll be a perfect time to try out posting from my cell phone. And catch up on my writing.  I have yet to find a suitable purpose for the little book Katy gave to me. It's a really cool book, so i don't want to ruin with crap, but I also don't want to have it sitting there forever blank.  I saw a cool book called "Off Ramp" at border's. It's a guy who wrote a bunch of essays while traveling across the country through back-roads and non-metro America. It seems like it would be an enjoyable read.  Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.......

       Actually she did. She  really  did.  So I just got back from EFY yesterday. EFY stands for Especially For Youth, and it is a summer youth camp put on by the church I go to. It was such an incredible experience, and it really changed my perspectives on many things and made me want to clean up my act and become a better person.  But, the coolest beyond cool thing happened there. On Tuesday night we had our first dance (of two). I was walking around, worn out and thirsty from "getting my groove on" (or lack thereof) when I heard a voice shout, "Go Audrey!" I thought to myself, 'wow, that's a name I haven't heard in a long time. My best(est) friend from ages 0 - 8 or so was named Audrey. Man, I really miss her.' So I take a glance in that direction. boom. I saw her. My best friend (plus some) that I hadn't seen or talked to in 10 years was dancing right there in front of me. So I, being the shy person I am, hovered around her, trying to glance at her name tag to make sure it was really her. It was. So when I built up the courage, I went up and said (like the smooth devil I am), "Hi Audrey! Do you remember me? I'm Tim." She cocked her head to the side, squinted at me, and then erupted in laughs and jumps and screams of joy. It really was her! So we danced the rest of the evening and caught up on each others lives. She was just as crazy as ever and w got along great. We reminded each other of so many old memories and it was an overall blast! I had found my "first crush." It was just a great week. After EFY ended we all (her family, mine, and Nate) went to breakfast. Then we had to say goodbye AGAIN. At least this time it was only a temporary goodbye; when she moved away when we were young, she moved to Canada. Now she lives in Virginia, only about 5 hours away, so I can drive up there and see her some weekend.  And when we said goodbye, she kissed me on the cheek and reminded me that when she had done that before, I promptly said "BLECH!" and wiped it off my face. Oh, come on. I was seven! I still thought girls had 'cooties'!  Ahhh... all is well in the world. and I can't stop smiling.

       Hershey is home. He stayed at the vet for four days on an IV to re-hydrate him. He did not "get over it" as the doctor hoped he would. He is in line for a kidney transplant (which I was surprised to find they actually do in cats), but he may not make the cut because he is on the borderline of being too old (he's fourteen). While we wait for an answer from the transplant people, he is at home on many different medications, but still not doing very well. He's weak and can hardly walk on his own. The doctor says if the transplant doesn't work out, he probably has a few weeks max to live. He's had a good long life for a cat, and I'd rather not have him suffer.  ...but I don't want him to leave.

       My cat is in the hospital for kidney failure. He probably will not make it. But it is possible that he might. Keep him in your thoughts and/or prayers. His name is Hershey and he is one of my best friends.

       I want to scream at the top of my lungs.  ..except my school doesn't really have halls. Oh well. Yes, that is John Mayer. I DO like that song. For all the crap people give him, his music is calming and pretty much sums up all teenage emotion into song form. Man am I gonna get crap for that.  But on to other things.  I really want to go for one all nighter with friends before the summer is out. Driving around the city in the cool summer air. Visiting different locations and walking under the stars, joking: "Your momma..." We will run foot races in the sacred ninja training grounds (at an undisclosed location) and walk the streets of uptown. We will scream random lines out of movies at the sky and wait to hear it answer back. We will sit at coffee shops until we get kicked out. When we do we will find another one. We will go bowling. We will go to waffle house at 3:24 am to see if it really is open 24 hours a day.  dance with kings and roll with pigs  I was wondering, "what makes someone a hopeless romantic?" I think I answered my question.  He sat there in knee-high grass with his eyes closed. He could feel the sun on his face, and the blades of grass tickling his elbows. He also felt a far-off presence. A growing presence. As it grew he realized it was not the presence itself that was growing, for it had always been there, but rather it was his perception of the presence that grew. He felt a warmth from another source other than the sun. He felt it all around him.  kafoobles.  He vanished into the mist almost as if he was the mist.

       I don't need it. I've been letting it overwhelm me for probably a year now (more?), but I just realized I don't need it. It'll happen someday, sometime, somewhere. For now, I'm cool. If it happens, cool. If it doesn't, cool. I'm not gonna go out of my way to look for it. I've got to be more grateful for the things I have before I have that. Yes. That sums it up.  Wow, somehow I feel great about myself now.  :-D

       No, this isn't a depressed post. I just thought that was funny.  Ahhhhh...  I love having friends. It is so wonderful.  I went without my hat for longer today than I have the rest of this summer combined. My hat has become a part of me. I would fall to pieces if something were to happen to it. And besides, my hair is so long now that it gets all up in my face without my hat there to hold it. I'm growing my hair out so that I can chop it off, save it for later, and glue it back on when I go bald. Because I will go bald. One day. It will probably start soon thanks to genetics. Stupid genetics.  Wouldn't it be cool if your traits came randomly, if they had nothing to do with your parents or heritage whatsoever? I think that would be cool. Yes.  I really can't wait for school to start. It's going to be a fantastic year. The last year of true freedom from responsibility. Truly.  I'm 18 in fifteen days. That means I can vote, buy cigarettes, and be a porn star. But I only plan to do one of those things. Guess which one. C'mon, guess.  I think I have matured more this summer than any other summer. I have finally achieved a mental state that is well and good. Mostly. Well, I'm almost there.  I got several text messages today.  He sat by the burning ashen cinders, that blind seer of tales. He was deep in meditation, inhaling the sweet smell of burning wood and incense that filled the small, crudely thatched hut. He awoke from that half-conscious state with a jolt. He had seen him. The Bringer of Tales. He was near, and he was approaching. Without delay the blind seer started the routine he rehearsed many times in preparation for this moment. He gathered his pack and filled it with all the holy writings of past sages and seers. He slung the pack over his shoulder, doused the cinders, and grabbed his staff by the doorway as he left. He emerged from the hut into the forest deep in autumn. The flame-colored leaves crunched beneath his feat as he left his home behind, never to return again.  ...uh, the holy writings were in braille, ok? Fine...  every snippet adds up.

       Yesterday I flew where no human ever dreamt of being for thousands of years. I saw giant orange mountains of clouds.  π  I saw The Village and it rocked my socks off. I guessed the ending 1/4th of the way through the film, though. "I think I know where this is going, but I don't know how the monsters play in here." ... "oooohhhhhhh. I get it."  Chapter one: The basic rules of love.  The first rule of love is that it doesn't make sense. The second is that as soon as you write down a rule for it, it breaks the rule, so by writing this everything written here is totally true. Except for rule two which is actually false. Because it is a written rule about love. SO that means rule one is...  Oh. Nevermind. ...it's late...  Now I feel like one of those annoying people that won't leave you alone and won't get a clue but your too nice to say, "go away" But I hope it was just that she was tired. Yeah. Tired. That's it.  The hunt is on. We're finding Katy a boyfriend. So watch out all you eligible sexy male specimens out there, here....we.....COME!!! *busts into the mall with a tranquilizer gun - commando style*  and I wanted this post to be good
