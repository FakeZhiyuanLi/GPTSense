      this is insane, i'm having dreams about him, i can't concentrate in class,  i can't stop thinking about him!!!!   last night in my dream, i skipped school to go to Mary Ward and i pretended i was a new student just so we could be together, and he did anything, everything for me...      It was Danyelle and him's anniversary yesterday.  she blew him off for another odd reason.  He said he was gonna talk to her about it, bitch, whatever, do Something about it...  but i knew what must've happened today.  he got angry, she was all nyah, 'oh i'm so sorry, i was just So busy and i couldn't get outta it.  i swear there won't be a next time'.  and he goes, yeah, yeah.. whatever. 'i'm not joking,...', and she grabs him, kisses him, reminding him of how 'hot' and how much a a whore she is, but how damn lucky he scored.  and they make up.  End of story, enough said.  anything Else you need to know?    but when i ACtually find out what happened... Then i will tell you... but i place my bets, and they are final.  Je, Carol Wing Ka Kong, suis amoureux de Philip Michael Vito Loconte.

      He.. is amazing.  Yesterday was so incredible, and he is so unbelievably irresistible.  I guess you could call it date #2.  I had planned to go for a walk with him, just in the area, by the park, but after deciding that i wanted a Betta fish,  we walked to pacific mall instead.  so we walk, and we talk.  it's awesome.  He is so sexy and we are always flirting, and i can't keep my eyes, my mind, Or my hands offa him!  Well i resisted for the time being, but i jsut couldn't stand it anymore!  His hands, so soft, his seductive lips, God what was I to do??   so tempting... so delicious...    (well i never Touched his lips :P too bad eh?)  yeah,.. so SExxxY.  and we all know what the XXX stands for;)  chloe and bryan.  sex maniacs, porn stars, whatever you want to call it, but you know it's existence.    His birthday present for me.. he had planned to kiss me.  And he said, when and where.  And i when i wanted it,  he couldn't pull through.  why?  Did he realize it wasn't right? not when he's still tied to danyelle.    I don't get it. there's no point pushing him either.  I just want him to mean it when he does something like that.  To really mean it, coming from his heart.  On that topic,  I'm wearing a wish bracelet which i put on on my birthday before i went to bed.  I know if anybody reads this,  my wish is doomed to die.  But i must let it out, because if i don't, i feel that my wish will have no hope of manifestation.  I wished that the man whom I truly love, would finally love me in return.   And I knew i couldn't waste this wish, but now that it's down in marble, I fear i might have.     But we can all understand why this is so.   Moulin Rouge, Christian, Satine,...  "The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return." it has started to fall apart, and the desire for it to shatter, and know that the one i love loves me in return has less strength that my desire to wait, and wait until I am ready to commit to love.  On the other hand.  Do i love Philip Loconte?  Could i possibly love him?  or.. puppy love, i suppose.  But i surely hope not.  I could do better. better looking,  smarter, more sensible, understanding, somebody who'll take care of me better.   But i am 15, could i possibly find a soulmate at my current age?  This goes back to Alan Reynolds.  How did i feel about him at that time...?  I thought i loved him yet i was only blinded until i realized he could not possibly feel the same way.  He was and is out of my league.  But such strong feelings that such a young age were naive.  I suppose i didn't comprehend them well enough to know my heart had only lied because my eyes had decieved me, thinking that he had felt more.   I know there are 18 milllion other guys out there. but i damn still miss talking to Alan.     anyway.  Love.  "Make love, not war" was what he said.. hehe ;)  love you phil!

      This situation is complicated, so i might as well write a 'schlick'. ..actually scratch that, that's TOO complicated for me.  I am falling in love for Philip.  Not even sexual healing.  I want to be in his pants so incredibly badly.  Yet my romantic desires overrule the sex.  who wants sex when you can have Love? (okay, even I wouldn't raise my hand for that suggestion), but I really really really really really really really really really really like this pretty white italian boy.   I like him so much, that I believe if i could spend more time with him, I will understand love, once again. but do i want to get into that now?  he's in grade 11.  i'm in grade 9.  a 2 year difference, adn in 2 years he'll be in University.  getting laid by all these hot girls, adn he'll love it.  and i'll know nothing if we were going out.  BUT if we were, he would respect it enough not to do that.  Did i mention that his sexy baby Danyelle is a whore?  :O whoops, oh my, it jsut slipped out. :P fine, she's hot, and out of phil's league, how could she fall for him? :P  yeah, i don't want to break his heart, that danyelle'll dump him.  Don't want to sound too enthusiastic, yet this is my only chance  except for saturday ;) may 22.  what should we do? hmm....? :D  love you all,  love him love myself love life.

      Bowling it is....  again .  How come there is absolutely nothing to do in this isolated home some know as Sarsborough?  In this area where Phil and I live, there are really only two potention things we can do, well 3.  .........  * "Contestant #1, behind which door do you think the prized BMW Cabriolet stands....???"      "uhhh... time to test my luck... *eyes closed, fingers crossed, pondering hard* Door.. number...3!" "This is the breathtaking moment which may or may not change the course of this lady's life....      aww.. I'm sorry.  Unfortunately our contestant today hasn't chosen the right direction.  On the other hand there is a consolation prize......" *  ~Just so you know, ladies and gentleman, the consolation prize was a trip to the bowling alley.  Club 300 Bowl at Old Kennedy and Steeles.  It was a gift certificate for 2, 2 games each, and 2 pairs of shoes totally up to $16.84.  All on the saturday morning of your choice.   *cheer, applaud*~  Just in case your appetite has grown, Date #3, and Date #1 has followed the same course.  Bowling, 2 games... a lot of.... touching, laughing, joking, touching...  but with a tiny bit of kissing, and MUCH more caressing and touching this time.  * "Contestant #2.  Today may just be your lucky day.  A chance to win a fully funded, including every single souvenir you buy, trip to Paris, France, the city of   love  , with your most intimate and passionate childhood lover."     "times like these drive me mad... *eyes closed, fingers crossed, pondering hard* Door #2, I choose you!" "Don't go away, we'll be right here, and waiting for you to return, and watch the revealing of the prize behind Door #2...."  *We'll be right back after these messages* "Okay who's up for the second round of... (insert stupid game show name here).. We've tortured contestant #2 enough for today,  so we'll get started with opening the mysterious door."      " WHAT? YOU PROMISED ME A TRIP FOR 2 TO FRANCE, NOT THIS *FUCKING SHITFACE* OF A PRIZE. WHAT THE *FUCKING HELL* DO YA TAKE ME FOR YOU *DAMN FUCKED UP FUCK*  [censored]   FUCK YOU! " *snow flakes the screen, blurred, black outs..* "We're sorry *fucking big grin on his face* .. technical difficulties for you guys watching behind the big screen from your couch.  Unfortunately, incase you missed it, Contestant #2, overreacted when he heard he unfortunately did not win his lucky grand prize of today.  Now let's show you what he does recieve." *  ~Ladies and gentlemen, the prize behind door #2, is of course admission into the grounds of Pacific Mall just at the corner of Kennedy and Steeles.  Yes.. we know the doors are open to the public, but hey this option is for the low cost, free of charge, in other words,  cheap  people who work excruciatingly hard every sunday for 8 hours, teach a well developped skill of  swimming .  Congrats to contestant #2. *cheer, applaud*~  Well, yes option #2 is to wander the aisles of Pacific Mall.  The dreaded community of mall rats jabbering away at an unknown dialect.  Seemingly completely foreign to the lands of Canada, so therefore finding solace under the tuscan sun... Whoops.  I meant on the floors of a Chinese owned, and regulated mall. Whatever it is to you, the real question is, what is there to do in such a place?  Shop, eat, arcade.  Well.. shopping is not an option when you have $5 in your pockets. Eating is not and option if I plan to make a change to my physical aspect. And... Let's not go towards the arcade section. Either way, walking and talking *wow, can carol rhyme!* is my first choice, although there are better places, soon to be revealed behind Door #1.....  * "Are you ready for the moment of truth?  Today's prize for Contestant #3, is your own private jet, flying wherever you want, whenever you want, however you want, and in whichever direction you choose, whether you want to take the longer route, the shorter route, or the extreme route to the end of the world.  Gas, pollution all prepaid onto my tab.. as well as whatever other needs, youre desires shall be fulfilled.  Box of ice cream, check.  Box of kleenex, check.  Box es  of condoms, check.  You name it, I supply it."      "the right choice huh... what shall it be this time??  what did the others choose?... *eyes closed, fingers crossed, pondering hard* Door #1.  and it better not screw me over." "Well... you chose the last door standing,  now let's reveal whether or not it really Does contain that prize or not...."      "huh?  is that what the inside of a jet looks like?" *  ~Oh come on.. you didn't really think either of the 3 doors had something valuable in  cash  behind them.  But todays theme of consolation prizes is all just a matter of time.  Time.  Quality time.  For a little more information, the consolation prize for Contestant #3 is.... A walk in the park.  Whichever park you choose, the one with trees, a canopy, a covering, a campfire.  Or the traditional, playground, with lots of toys... big toys.. and all that jazz.  Yes, piggy backs inclusive. and whatever else you want.~  Gimme a break.  Yes, we know walking is always the option, through the park, and whatever other terrain you want to explore.  But please, isn't there anything else you could remotely do in scarborough?   get shot.   Not a bad plan... as a matter of fact, I won't be needing to plan it if I decide to walk through Tuxedo Court to get to McDonalds or where ever else for lunch one day.. Seeing that I live in the school where kids are golf clubbed in their heads, beaten with whatever else, and  shot  in the apartment adjacent to the school.  ... I think I have that remote chance for it to happen.  Sounds good?  But yes... the traditional walk. I like it.  I'm a sucker for sappy love stories.  I'm a sucker for romanticism.  The old stuff.  Hand holding, 80s style, whatever else.  It's a good way to know each other, have fun, whatever else....    Just to get to the point,  I'm here to relieve all the bottled up emotions.  Whether it's pain, fear, joy, sadness, stress, discomfort, happiness,  love?  I am loving every minute of it.  yet on the other hand,  I need to ask myself that one question.  of whether I actually want love or lust?  I know in myself that I want love, but why is it.  that when I see that face,  that seductive smile.  that seductive face. it's that "I wanna fuck you so badly" face. or the "Can't I kiss you" face.  Why do I fall for you so much??? I must tell you.  you Aren't drop dead gorgeous.  you Aren't glamourously beautiful.  But... but that smile.  It isn't your teeth from years of braces, and elastics and struggling.  It's just that smile you cast out to me.. so seductive... but only because seeing that smile means knowing that you're having fun, having a good time.  means you do have fun with me, means you do care, and it means everything else in the world is at peace.  I drown staring at you. I drown staring at your face, you eyes, staring into your eyes... why I can't I stop staring?  Why can't I stop smiling, and just kiss the goddamn face outta you? ask me this... And know what i'll say?  I don't know.  no, not that I don't know what to say.  but In fact i'll say it. I don't know.  Is is because I am in love? Or... because I am just so pretentious adn I wish everything between us could be perfect, jsut the way I want it.  or WHAT? what do I want out of you, Philip? and how come I can't get it? and how come I'm the one chasing the guy?  Aren't guys supposed to chase for the girls?  I am so confused....  Why do I keep kissing you... All the time. . I know it only pains me to know... why do you do this?  because it pleasures you?. because it pleasures me because i'm not thinkig? or what?  just because i'mnot thinking about it, not about later. shouldn't be the reason to torture me... torment me.  Screw with me? (my mind.. not.. physically.....),  and what's wrong with me? how come I can't just stay out of your pants?  Is it because it's that face you give me.... the seductive face again? and i jsut love seeing it so much. or something but I wanna please the hell outta you so badly sometimes, and I guess I can't do anything about it... but. just WANT you soooo badly. so Unbelieveably badly it kills me to the bone.  Yes it's all you. all your fault i'm so messed in my heart, messed in my head.  Yet i know you care, I know you don't want to hurt me, I know you care.  but why can't you just resist me for once??????? why cant I do it??? oh yes. here it bites me in the ass once again.  "I can resist everything except temptation."  Big fucking deal.  Is that the only reason though? that single liner.  the one I use day in day out to explain all my actions.  Unfortunately I'm starting to realize that perhaps this is just a cover to hide what I feel, what I want, the want to be a rebel sometimes, and...  I don't know.. I am so confused.  wow.  What can I say?  one word sums up who you are.  One word tells me exactly about you. everything I've ever known about you.   seductive .  I just love watching you struggle.  Not Just struggle, but I love watching you have so much fun.  I love that face, and how come I can't open up and put to worse how I feel sometimes when i'm with you?  Why am I always left speechless at the bowling alley?  is there a reason to hide what I'm thinking or do I go blank staring into your eyes like that?   Don't know Can't tell How can i?  Here's a poem for ya, think about it...  In conclusion, I live the life... And you know it ;)  I had a blast as I always do, and Philip just makes me smile So hard my mouth hurts afterwards.  I love this guy.   I like him.  He likes me. I love him.  He likes me.

      i think i did ruin my wish.  Otherwise reversed it. But with love comes hatred and sorrow.  Let me start from the beginning..  I went over to Phil's today.  got on his bed, did some stuff.. "stuff" i'll stick to for now.  But what it really consisted of was... kissing, caressing, nudity, blowjobing, and handjobing... alright. so we were doing 'stuff' when his sister came home.. it was pretty hilarious. and i sneaked out the door.  But don't you think we went a little far? a little far considering, today was the first time he's ever kissed me. ever done anything further than hugging me and holding my hand.  Perhaps too far?  if I could've resisted him... would I be in the dilemma I think I'm in now?  So i just spoke to him.. and I asked what our current status was....  Philip says: (6:09:32 PM)    dunno..  Philip says: (6:09:44 PM)    are...we...still....friends?    WHOA, I was hoping at least a little more after all that we did this morning..   Philip says: (6:10:29 PM)    i dunno  Philip says: (6:10:37 PM)    if i want anything more than friends right now  Philip says: (6:10:51 PM)    im sorry..    what did you say?.. Sorry? funny I don't believe it.  no more than friends? of course not, just fuck buddies.     karol says: (6:11:07 PM)    oh so all you really wanna do is just fool around with me?   Philip says: (6:11:18 PM)    no....  Philip says: (6:12:27 PM)    i dont know carol    don't know, eh? that's quite appalling, I was quite sure I had the correct answer.     karol says: (6:12:37 PM)    so what Do you want?   Philip says: (6:12:49 PM)    i gues  Philip says: (6:12:51 PM)    right now..  Philip says: (6:13:00 PM)    just... to be friends   karol says: (6:13:34 PM)    just to be friends adn to fool around whenever you want.   Philip says: (6:13:47 PM)    look im sorry    sorry again?  sure you even feel that way?   Philip says: (6:14:04 PM)    maybe it would be better if you didnt come over tomorrow    ding ding ding! is this the first thing 'Right' you've said to me today?     karol says: (6:14:16 PM)    Yeah.. perhaps   Philip says: (6:14:51 PM)    k    Glad you don't want me over.  I don't want over anymore.  not if all you want is just to fuck with my mind and everything else.    karol says: (6:15:11 PM)    i mean it's not like it really matters to you anyway   Philip says: (6:15:29 PM)    look carol  Philip says: (6:15:36 PM)    im sorry    still? and not at all dishonest?    Philip says: (6:15:39 PM)    what do you want me to say    oh the possibiilties.. what about '*cloying 80s' romantic* oh carol i love you i'm so sorry,  won't you forgive me? You know I'm just being a fool.' or  'sorry I was so decieving,  maybe I Shouldn't have led you on so far like that.' or NOTHING.    Philip says: (6:15:43 PM)    and believe me i do care    care my ass.  but I believe you, I suppose you care.     karol says: (6:16:22 PM)    there is nothing to say   Philip says: (6:16:45 PM)    ok    good.  dont wanna hear from you anymore.  not now at least.     Getting myself tied up in a knot.  I think it is my own fault.  I'm just incompetent.  Perhaps posting this will only make my situation worse.  I don't see what good it will do.  But what good is just deleting this in 3 minutes?  I feel so used.  Yes I had fun.  And some would say that's all that matters.  But I feel.. like nothing.  like i'm worth nothing.  I'd love to stay friends.  but stop deceiving me! I don't want to be friends and a little more knowing that i'm replaceable.  Knowing that i'm not near the best, or that i'm just so ordinary, like everyone else disgusts me.  I can't live without standing out.  I couldn't live without being special.   but what can I say.  there is nothing to say.   irresistible yet repulsive.

      Damn am I glad none of you know about this site.  (cept henry, but he won't tell, or he's already forgotten).  So yeah.  Ever heard of that proverb?  I read it in The Alchemist.    "Everything that happens once can never happen again.  But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time."   So clueing you in from the very beginning.  Tomorrow is Phil's birthday.  July 27.  Happy 17th.  So we went out, had a GOOD time, and we came to the conclusion that since it's his birthday, he can do Whatever he wants (cept fuck me) However he wants it.  and that he could even ask me to do Whatever he wants (cept fuck me) However he wants it.  So he did.  or actually, I offered to the birthday boy....     And my tongue was all over his face, all wet, and that was turning the pump on.  he closed his eyes.  I opened my mouth.  ......   So we get to a certain point. and we're behind the trees that are behind the hospital, or at least the ambulance thing.  And then while we are getting far, and having such a fuckin awesome time.   ..... These kids are walking towards us!  YES! BUSTED AGAIN.  So Phil's like. oh shit! not again!!!!!  haha. so we start running, and then THEy start running.  And that REALLY made my day.  That was the fucking funniest thing that i've done for such a LONG time.  okay, it wasn't very FUN, but it was damn FUN-NY.  jezuz.  I can't believe it.  Last time, we were on his bed and it's his sister, and now this time, it's these crazy kids chasing after us!  So yeah. I better keep my eyes open. or better yet stay away from that for a while.  Since you know how that saying goes.  It's damn well gonna happen another time.  The question now is WHO.  What if the next time it's our parents??  yes, how I could fancy that.  that would be the end of us, I'm sure of it.     yeah... I love it.  I love being with Phil.  he keeps me in line.  I mean Other times I'm this crazy girl who sometimes you guess you just can't control.  And at Other times, i'm fully stressed becuase my expectations are way too high and i'm too ambitious.  So he keeps me where I should be.  Relaxed, but not forgetting my responsibilities.   I'm glad I have so much fun with Phil :)   Thank you.  And happy birthday, it's gonna be a fuckin good one.  I guarentee it ;)

      The situation at hand is too much for me to say, too much for me to handle, and it's just confusing me so much, I don't get it.  I can't tell you because it's so... weird.  What should I do??  help me please......... help me.  *go  here  is you are confused.  I sure am.

      ...I know.   I can't seem to change my template and make my own.  I don't know why, perhaps cuz I'm cheating and frustrated.  I need more butterflies.   Go to my xanga by pressing the link.  This is what my site will look like soon.  I hope! Bear with me... you have been uncovered on my Xanga.  I hope I do not regret this.  althought some entries date back So far.. I am going to make those private.  They will humiliate and embarrass me.  -----okay they are gone, they never happened and you don't know anything about them.

      .. is what I am.  No doubt, because I had such a wonderful time, and I was just so pissed that he knew so little about me, yet could I blame him?  well Yes and No, because he just seemed to forget everything I've told him, but because he has a bad memory? or we discussed these things at a time where he didn't even care about me? or what?   Either way you could somewhat blame it on me, because perhaps I only told him once, or something (didn't he?).  But that's not the point, and now he's angry that I am mad at him.  Now what am I supposed to do? "you know.. im not as stupid as you take me for.. if you wanna be mad.. fine w/e" :'( No, I don't want to me mad, and I know you're not stupid and thank God for that.  I'm so sorry that I made you feel so bad,  but that was thursday's trouble, and today's saturday, and I just had an amazing time today.  You're fun to be with, and I that's what I love so much about you.  I'm so sorry it's hard for you to see that.  I know that sometimes I try to hide my fun factor because it makes me so vulnerable, and it hurts to know that you're... jsut using me?  But you don't seem to want anything with me except for.. that.  And it's not fair for me because all I seem to do is pretend.  I lie to myself, make things better,  make things better than they really are.  But it's all just a stupid lie.  a STUPID lie.  I'm just making things difficult for me, for Us.  If you don't get angry, or if you can actuall withstand my stupidity, then all the better, because the only thing it'll mean in the future is how much we can fight together and still live afterwards.  I'm so sorry.  I know you care, but still you don't because I know you hate it when girls get mad at you and it's completely beyond your control.   completely beyond? not quite  .  And I am going to apologize again, because I am such an idiot.  I can't help it and I suppose it's just within my nature.  I don't want you to be telling me "fine w/e" because at that point, I realize that it's Not fine, and you don't want w/e to happen.  I'm not happy, and I know you aren't either because of it.  Sorry, don't bother trying to make me happy again because that would just be a waste of time.   I will be delighted to just see you smile.  Philip, I know I can be confusing, and, yeah I guess two-faced :P and whatever type of crap you have in store to call me.  Just say it.  I'm an emotional bitch.

      .. You heard me, confusion.  That's the one word he chose to describe me.  And I guess he is right.  I am confusing.   Trés .  So it's becuase I'm naive, and I think too much, and I get too worked up, and i'm So nervous, and I guess it's because I'm so unsure of my life!  Sorry, if you're reading this.  I deeply apologize for my talents in confusing people.        okay! time to be cheerful again.  Cuz that's who I am, no matter how confusing, I am always sooooo cheerful. :D   "I can't believe how chee s y you were at 7am.  Oh well I guess you're used to it."    "I can't believe how chee r y you were at 7am.  Oh well I guess you're used to it."   (i swear, in the yearbook it looked like cheesy the first 10 times I read it.  but matt swears it's cheery.)

      what the hell is wrong with me???  That was my one big chance and I completely blew it, once again.  It's nothing new,  Carol's on a roll, and once again she blows her one good chance because of her insecurity, or some other reason, or the hell I don't even know what the fuck it is.  I finally get to the point where he's mad about me, whether or not it's just sexually, I still drive him crazy.  And there's something WRONG with me.  I get all PISSED just because he forgot when my birthday was.  Oh yeah, btw, it Started when he forgot my number.  What next is he gonna forget my NAME too?  *rolls eyes*  CUT.  Wait, roll that back a touch.  Look closely in that corner.  What's she doing with her eyes? Rolling them, AGAIN?   this girls got some major shit wrong with her head.    what is WRONG with me??? I still can't get it,  I like this guy so much.  More than he'll ever know,  more than anybody will, because, I thought at least, we had an amazing relationship.  At least I had thought that because I thought he knew a lot about me, I thought he cared, and knew me well....   but he knows so little.  And  maybe  I'm wrong, or  maybe I'm so paranoid, or  maybe, God please don't let this be,  I'm right.    But whatever my mind is trying to tell me, or whatever those signs outside are,  I keep thinking that, He doesn't want to change the fact that he knows little about me.  That he doesn't want to know more, he never did, and never will.  I'm praying that i'm just being paranoid, I really hope it's just that too.  I'd be depressed, and i'm not joking one bit, if he truly felt that way.  I'd bawl my eyes out, until I went blind.  Somehow, someway, I just want him to read this so much, for him to know that I love this guy.  I care for him so much, and perhaps he just cares for everybody, but he cares for me too..  and so what if he makes me feel so special sometimes, but right now I feel like a dump.  A pop can trashed onto the floor of a strip club.   Trash, yet way beyond that. Trashed for being fucked with.  Trashed for being toyed with.  Trash for just getting a little carried away with somebody who I really care about but doesn't seem to care that much about me.  or does he? how am I supposed to know?    AGH know what pisses me off the most about him? his STUPID phrases.  "maybe" "i dunno" I HATE THEM TO HELL.  It's just that, they.. scare me.  I'm scared to think of what  really  lies under the cover up.  Yes? No? Maybe? I do know that you don't want to hear it? I'm trying to get you to stop talking about it because this topic sucks and the truth will kill you? I'm fucked and I don't want you helping me? I'm a boring person so it's your call? I hate you and will never tell you? You're confusing me, now ask me again, without any of that context? I don't want to tell you cuz it'll kill you, and it won't be anywhere sweet? I don't want to tell you because it's embarassing? I don't to tell you because you'll get pissed? You'll Get Pissed Because I'm Just Waiting To Fuck You Inside Out, And That's All The Use You Are?  The truth will hurt, and I'm not ready to see you hurt?  I don't know?  *tear*   Hearts don't break.  Most times they just bend.   If he ever read this I would be devastated,  I'd be vulnerable to him.  Too vulnerable, more than I already am.  You already know he's got me.  he's taken me away, swept me off his feet, away where he can fuck me til the days dies, and then throw me into the gutters for prince charming to rape me and let me die of aids.  AM I TOO MUCH OF A DRAMAQUEEN?  is my constant pestering, and constant jabber what's driving him away?  maybe.  Maybe i'll just stop talking for once.  Okay, dear diary, it's said the deal's done.  the next time I talk to him, I won't talk so much.  No, straight, direct, no dramatic stories, exxagerations, Whatever it is. I don't care.  I just won't talk.  I don't get it. I want him to know how I feel yet I'm at a loss of words, or I don't want to tell him, I don't know how, I change the topic. or something Ijust can't tell him. or he can't take me seriously, or Something gets in my way.. :'( I don't get it!!!!!!!!!!    I want Philip to just spill his mind out to me, I want to know everything, everything.  Even if it doesn't relate to me. just Everything.  No more secrets.  Secrets hurt. Maybe writing it out is My medium, but I know talking is his..  tell me Philip,  tell me you love me  tell me everything that you're thinking of, anything, everything, just Tell me how you feel about me.  Truthfully, no lies, no secrets.  I just need to know.  otherwise these paranoid thoughts will never leave my head.  I'm not joking they only get worse.  I'm going to grow up to be a schitzophrenic.  that's what.  i'm 99% sure on that too.  whatever, I love you still and I want you to read this, but I don't want you to know how I feel so precisely to this point.

      ...after such a wonderful 'date' out with Phil. watching farenheit 9/11.  And we had an amazing time, and we're going mad for each other.  A little too crazy at sometimes.  (parents out to pick up my sister, so we had the house to ourselves for a while).    Anyway on to the real story.... I started talking to Andrew Elliot again since I wanted to go to Wonderland with him to make good use of the wasted seasonspass that I shouldnt have bought in the first place.  And then.. I dont' exactly know how, but talking to him somehow lead to asking him out/??  Okay i'm not even going to try to explain because I don't know What was happening in my mind!  We were talking and I dont' know why but I started to remember that he had once asked me out, and I rejected him  althought it wasnt' a blatant 'no' .  And i STill don't know why but I brought that up!!!  OMG WHAT WAS I THINKING??   how STUPID of me... and then to top it all off... "anyway, does teh invitation still stand?".  what WAS i thinking?    we all know that nothing of this sort is ever going to end happy.  I'm crazy about Philip, but somehow I just can't seem to admit it's the truth becuase he won't.  he's pressuring me to denying my feelings for him, in a way.  It's becuase he hates talking about it, I don't know what the hell is going on in his mind (besides the dirty thoughts).  And so I don't want to honestly tell him how I feel without joking, or fabricating anything in fear that he doesn't feel the same way, potentially harming our relationship as close friends right now.   So now,  I suppose I just was afraid of what's happening, I need somewhere to vent all the bottled up emotions, and what better than to let them out on somebody else?? Except look at all the disasters I may have caused.  If Phil does indeed like me, then he's not gonna be happy at what i just did.  And if Andrew really wants me, then he's not going to be happy when I reject him a second time, or blow our plans, or stand him up or SOmething I may do in the future.  And now you can already tell i'm not happy, seeing that I need to write it out to you, it's already a problem.  And then?  i'll keep thinking of Phil, things Aren't going to work out with Andrew, he'll be sad, i'll be guilty, i'll want Phil more just to vent out MORE emotions, and then blow him (and do a terribel job), or get him to eat me out and then he'll want to turn it down a notch cuz we're going to fast.  and God knows that's not a good thing....  UGH, if I can already predict exactly what will happen, then why am I still doing it?  Is it because I was unable to think of this earlier when I needed to know.  Or is this supposed to happen, so I can remember in the future not to make the same mistake at a risky time?  Or maybe its supposed to help me remember and want Philip more, which is a better relationship and will keep us together longer?  I don't know.  God help me, lead me through cuz I don't know what to do.  Is trusting my instincts the way to live it? or should I have been more rational.  And what now?  trust my fickle mind not to be all over Andrew at Wonderland?  or ensure myself that i'll keep my greasy, selfish paws off of him even if he wants me too.?  Or just pounce on him and lead him on.  then what do I do about Phil?  I like him a lot.  And God knows how I can't keep my hands off, my mouth off, and any other part of my body away from him.  he's just so warming and caring, it's hard not to resist.  And then add in then Crazy about each other Factor,  the Extreme Wanting, the Mad Kissing, the Driving Each Other Insane.....  :s okay.  I know I could never go out with Andrew.  Younger boys rarely appeal to me. but Andrew always makes me smile.  he lets it go my way all the time. (is that good or bad).  And Philip.. well, 5 words.  He keeps me in line.  (whether calming me down, or uping the mood). (sigh).... school with Andrew all year next year is going to be harsh without one single dirty, or clean thought about him.  Oh well.. let's just let it unfold the way God wants it too.  thanks for the advice and consolation.  I'm still nervous though.
