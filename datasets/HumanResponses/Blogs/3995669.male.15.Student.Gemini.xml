       Yesturday (Thursday) I sat around the house like all day. I did mow the grass late in the day. Then I whined and we went to Burger King. I ordered a King-size Double Bacon Cheeseburger meal, and when I pulled through and got it out to devour, I found there was only  one  patty on my burger!! I demanded we turn around and they handed me another burger and said, "Sorry about that. Have a nice day." And we just pulled off -- so I got a burger for free. Hehe  This morning we got up and went to  urlLink Penn's Cave . I was really upset, though, because the water level was too high to take the boat out on the lake, so we just went around the cave. It was kind of boring, and the water kept dripping down in the cave and it was really upsetting me.  After Penn's Cave we went to State College. I went to Abercrombie and got a couple things.        Then we went to  urlLink Nittany Mall . That's dissapointing. I haven't been there in like three years. I like our mall better. I didn't get anything from there. There wasn't anything good I saw. Then we stopped at the Super Wal Mart in Mill Hall on the way home. I got a couple school supplies there.  I came home, and my grandparents from out of town are in ... I have to work tomorrow at Lock Haven store.  Random Thought: What made Alexander Grahm Bell, the inventor of the telephone, come and stay overnight at Penn's Cave, and tour the cave??  I like ... Frank Sinatra I hate ... melting blizzards or any kind of ice cream

       (Tuesday) - Went to the mall with my boos Abby and Amanda. We took the CityBus there - the 2:00pm mall bus, for all you CityBus vets out there. And we got there and went shopping. I bought new white sneakers, and two pairs of jeans and a glasses case ... and Lacoste cologne, and I got a free gift with it.  I was wearing a less-than-perfect outfit so I changed in the Coffee & Tea place bathroom (where I purchased two drinks because the first one I didn't like). By the way - their bathrooms are really nice, a lot nicer than McDonalds, so use theirs next time you go to the mall.  Then my back was getting tired carrying all of that, so we went to Sears and I got in a shopping cart and Abby pushed me around in it in the center of the mall - haha. Then she pushed me, and let me keep going and her and Amanda walked away. It was so embarrasing. Then I pushed Abby and her fat behind crushed my shoebox.s  We took the CityBus back to Williamsport then ...  Today I went to Lock Haven for a few hours - there was a problem at the store, and I went out to eat at this good Italian restaurant, The Village Tavern. Their salad is so good. I am working Saturday there too.  Tomorrow I have to go to Lewisburg because my dad is getting his nose done - he has a deviated septum or something.  Right now I am listening to Variety ... it is the dance program, and it is really good.  Abby's name> Keisha  Random Thought: What will happen when we run out of plastic?  I like ... Neopolitan ice cream (especially eating it right from the tub, so I can switch between the three flavors)  I hate ... watching people eat ice cream and italian ice ... it's just really upsetting.  Feedback Question: Are you looking forward to school coming up?

       Salutations !   An update on (Sunday morning's) entry - I napped for about a half hour to an hour, then got up. I was drowsy and  very, very  cranky at first, then I had some more Red Bull - I know what I said in my last entry, but I  needed  it. Eventually I was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

       I am finally home ... it is  always  nice to come home to your own house, own bed ...  Well, today was one of the nicest days I have had ... we went out on&nbsp;a  urlLink yacht  my aunt chartered, which was really nice. The captain took us on a tour of the lake - Lake Norman (not the same area where the dastardly beach is located) - and there are celebrity homes around there, not any "big names" but a lot of race car drivers and sports figures. Then in the middle of the lake we went swimming, which was really nice. Everyone jumped off the top of this two-story boat and landed in the water. It was really fun ... the sensation of falling.     Then we came home, and relaxed a little. The ice cream man came and we got ice cream ... and we started packing and getting around (I was already packed) at about 8. Then we were on the road by 9pm. We drove straight through ... and made it in 7 hours 45 minutes (which has to be a record with kids and dog in car)&nbsp;... the kids slept the whole time so there was no stressful whining, and I was in the passenger seat, and my dad just drove straight through. He wanted me to stay awake to keep him awake though, but then he kept saying "get your rest for tomorrow (today) and then when I'd doze off he'd wake me up "Do you hear the tires ?? We might have a leak." "Are we going the right way ?" (note that there is a long stretch where you drive 300-some miles on the same highway) ... but I stayed up pretty much the whole time. We stopped for gas twice ... and I kept stocking up on  urlLink Red Bull  to get me through !  (UPDATE ... as I am trying to find a Red Bull site to link for in this journal, I am seeing some alarming results !!  urlLink France and Denmark refuse to allow it's sale  except in pharmacies because it has been  urlLink linked to deaths  - some in America. I am upset.)  There is no way I can go to sleep -- I may have&nbsp;a nap of less than 30 minutes. After about 30 or 40 minutes, your body kicks into another phase of sleep, which could mean that if I wake up without having a proper amount of sleep, my body will feel tired because it will be confused. On the other hand, if you have a nap or two (seperated by a good amount of time) that could just boost your energy levels to normal. I am not a coffee drinker, but I think I might have to stop by Dunkin Donuts to grab a frozen thingy, because I am upset about the Red Bull drink death accusations - but I do find it humorous they are considered "hip" to drink in clubs. Also - side-note in case people didn't know: In West Virginia and Virginia and North Carolina, they sell beer everywhere - in mini-marts, grocery stores have wine coolers and stuff sitting right out in the middle of the cheese/milk isle. It's hilarious. Also - another amusing story. At a gas station in West Virginia, there was this wretched male human with foul body odor, and really visibly dirty clothes (the place itself wasn't a dump ...) who was talking to the cashier the entire time we were there, and the cashier was trash, had teeth missing and&nbsp;a black eye, and when my dad got a piece of beef jerkey from the thing up front, the guy is like "those th a ngs are good, 'xcept I spend about 20 bucks a month on them thangs." I found it both disturbing and comical.  Now I am off to get a nice looonnnggg shower ... just stand under the hot water, and take my time getting ready to go to Knoebels today with the family and Ashley. Right now the sun is rising and it's nice and peaceful ... the birds are chirping and stuff. Yeah - it's only interesting for a few minutes. Peace out~!

       Today was an emotional roller-coaster. I was upset in the morning because we were supposed to go to the Hickory mall (that has Abercrombie & Hollister,) but we didn't ... so I was depressed and bored -- just sitting around the house. Then at about 3 we went to Birkdale, which lifted my moods. I got a lot of stuff:   AE:   urlLink Corduroy Jeans &nbsp;      &nbsp; and a messenger bag and sunglasses - no photos.  GAP:   urlLink Jean jacket       Pants- I am going to take back.  Old Navy:  Jeans - probably going to take back.   urlLink Canvas Backpack      -by the way- I am upset that it is on sale online, because I got it for full price in the store.  Then we went to dinner at  urlLink Hop's Restaurant and Bar . It was a pretty nice place ... It's has California stuff. It has it's own brewery in there - and we sat in a table right next to it and you can see the root beer and beer being brewed. It's neat. Like Bull Frog Brewery. The food was really good too. They have this bread that's kind of like sticky buns.  Tomorrow we are probably leaving ... at 1 we are going on this yacht in Lake Norman. I'll write more later. BYE

       HELLO. I am so devastated because I wrote out a whole entry for yesturday and there was an error. (Long sigh) By the way - the subject is my current mood. Soon I plan to transfer my old entries on LiveJournal here ...   Anyways - yesturday we went to this dumpy beach on  urlLink Lake Norman &nbsp;- it's called Lake Norman State Park. The waters were infested with duck dung. It was a disgrace and I refused to step foot in the water. We were there about a half hour and left - came home to the pool. It's so hot here ! It peaks around 90 with a heat index of 96. Of course the house is central air, so I don't mind it.   There is this really nice mall down the street ... it's outdoor and is like a real little town, it has streets and several buildings, and on the bottom floor there are shops, and above them apartments. It's called Birkdale. Look at photo of it:     We play volleyball everyday in the back yard. I love it. I wish there were more volleyball outlets in Williamsport. My dad is on a quizzical "workout" regimine. He gets up and runs "5 miles" - of course everything is exaggerated, so it's about a mile or two. Then is exhausted the rest of the day. Then he insists on leaving his sweatshirt on the rest of the day -- in 90 degree weather because he "wants to sweat" which can lead to dehydration on a humid day. He thinks it makes him loose weight, when technically it burns very few  urlLink calories  - which is the foundation of all weight control.   Random Thought: Isn't it so sad that most dogs never have sex in their lives ??   I love ...  urlLink Blistex Medicated Lip Balm  - the green kind  I hate ...  urlLink Diet Coke with Lime &nbsp; (side note: I  love  Diet Coke and caffeine free Diet Coke)   Feedback Question: Do you like embedded links ?   >>Leave a comment.

       Have not written because I haven't really had any exciting events or ground-breaking thoughts lately. I've been working all week at the Lock Haven dry cleaners, and I will be this week as well. But that means I get CA$H to go shopping with when I go away for a week to my gram's near Harrisburg.  I am extremely upset regarding scheduling. I received my schedule in the mail on Saturday, accompanied with a letter:   Dear Geordan Grieco (10):      In this mailing, you will find your schedule for the 2004-05 school year. Every year, for a variety of reasons, certain course selections cannot be accommodated by the master schedule.      Unfortunately, we have not been able to include   Chemistry I Honors, Business Management, Marketing  ,  one   of your  original requests, in your schedule for the 2004-05 school year, because of a conflict with   Too many requests and alignment of courses selected.      We have replaced your original request(s) with   Computer Programming, Chemistry I .       If you are satisfied with the change(s), you do not need to do anything. However, if you prefer some other arrangement, guidance counselors will be available at the high school on WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 18, 2004, from 8:00am - 2:00pm to assist you with schedule revisions ... This will be the only day changes will be made, so please make arrangements to be here. PLEASE BRING YOUR SCHEDULE AND THIS LETTER WITH YOU.      In the meantime, please give careful consideration to those replacement courses you feel are best suited to your needs. Be reminded that the schedule adjustments must conform to the distribution requirements outlined on page 5 of the Student Handbook. It may be that you will want to reinstate the course(s) deleted while eliminating something else from your schedule. Again, scheduling limitations might well prevent our adding some of these courses. I apologize for this inconvenience .   (Signed) John P. Cokefair   Red House Principal      P.S. If you have a question or if you would like to work on your schedule with me prior to this date, please call me at 323-8411, ext. 3240. I will do my best to help you. Please remember that NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE AFTER AUGUST 18, 2004.   .......... You can just imagine how infuriated I was when I received this letter. How in the hell are they going to put me in an academic course because they don't have enough openings or something?? What kind of a fucking Mickey Mouse operation are they running?? And why in God's name would they put me in Computer Programming??? Also - August 18th is the time period I will be at my gram's house. So I am planning to call FIRST THING tomorrow (Monday) morning, because this is bull shit. I would also like to explain my choice of using  blue   to highlight above where it says "one". I actually have THREE courses that they aren't giving me. I am just so freaking upset. This crap happened last year ... I got my schedule, then I got to school and they gave me a new one, with the order of periods and everything moved around. It just infuriates me. I was absolutely freaking LIVID when I opened that mail. Why can't anything just be fucking easy??? I about laughed when I read the letter from Huddy about their "outstanding academic offerings" Yeah ... maybe if I'd be able to get at least 2/3 of the classes I was recommended to/asked for. I'll say it right now: if there is no way around changing Computer Programming (which I doubt) or Chemistry regular ... I will NOT be showing up for those classes. Also ... it is odd: on my schedule, they gave me Study Hall with Mr. Grove first period?? I used to have his Biology Honors first period. Is he not teaching that now? If not, I wonder why ...??!?!? Hmm ...   I will update you on the progression of these disturbing events in a later posting.  Random Thought: Why was I born white?  I love ... Jello instant pudding I hate ... public toilet seats  Comment ------------------------------------------------>

       I would like to comment quickly that tonight I have been giddy, and I am not sure why?  Kaitlin, Tobias, and myself had a three-way   ( ... conversation that is) for like a half-hour. Kaitlin and I were talking the entire time and Toby could barely get a word in. It was pretty amusing. Also - previous to that, I was alternating between "urgent messages" which included topics such as deodorant, lava lamps, and bladder-control-challenged foster children with Abby and Kaitlin on the phone.  Aren't I hysterical?  Random Thought: Why don't security sensors cause holes in garments? Are they magnetic or what is going on?  I like ... rainy "first kiss" scenes in movies. I hate ... cheap people.
