      ...there are times that i would just like to write down what's on my mind...not thinking at all whether it makes sense or not....i just want to talk and talk...most of the time, nobody's around to listen or to keep up with me....finally my own blog site....nyahahahahaha...so what would my blog site have? i dunno....no freakin' idea...but just bear with me...and maybe...just maybe...we'll be able to learn a lot about each other...hmmm....so send me a message....tell me something about yourself...or about anybody or anything you want to talk about...doesn't matter to me...so i dare you to exchange ideas with me...i dont care if its nonsensical...i just want to talk...so lets do it...

      a couple of months ago..when i was kind of depressed...i was sitting inside the car with my mother on our way to my grandma's place...i was so quiet and so out of everything that i was mostly looking at the floor and memorizing either the line of the carpet inside the car or the cracks on the road...suddenly...just suddenly...i looked up and saw this truck full of pigs in it...the pigs were all scrambling and trying to get their heads out of the back of the truck...for what? i dunno...but surely it made me happy...first time in my life...i saw a pig smiling back at me...and believe me it was such a refreshing feeling...that i forgot about my depression...  imagine a pig at the back of a truck...with his head out smiling at me!!! literally smiling you know...from ear to ear...the irony in it... is that in a few hours the pig will be at the slaughterhouse....and in a couple of hours sold on the market...and after maybe another hour it would be in somebody else's table top...that made me sad again...but not so sad...because i will forever hold in my memory the face of the smiling pig...
