       urlLink    this one's for you, christine. i keeps it real. yeah i tagged this wack-ass dumpster, cus i'm kerazy. yeah you don't even want none of this. aaah sike! actually i got it from the deftones  urlLink website . holy hell they're in the studio, actually in the same house incubus was in when they recorded morning view, which was a good cd btw, except for that song "Echo". lol that was some cheesy shit. anyway, the new cd better be damn good, cus the last one was a little weak, not anywhere as good as white pony.  sooooo CRAZY ASS GOAT/PIGGY GIRL aka christine left me another voicemail (not surprisingly,  right? ) and she's all,"  Hey Tim, uh...a bunch of us are going to the movies Saturday...........you can come too! So give me a call back tomorrow, okay? Bye!"  now, any other guy would jump on the opportunity to catch a flick, but i'm smarter than that. yeah, i know what's going on with that shit. i bet she's not even going with anyone. yeah that's it. she's just trying to use telepathic powers to psych the shit out of me. five bucks says somehow everyone else will miraculously not be able to go, and it'll be just me and her. no bitch, you can't seduce me. HA! i'll kick her ass if she doesn't maintain at least 200ft away from me. she's never seen kung-fu like my kung-fu. yeah i sent a guy to the fuckin' hospital, so don't mess with my ass. a wise man once said, "  GET OFF MY PIECE!"     besides, i'm heading my ass to the engine room to have myself a goodass time. that's right, baby,  edgebrook:live ! i mean, i start my week downloading mp3s from apache servers owned by people i don't even know and end it with some good ol' ska. now that's a bitchin' week, kids. even though there are some people  urlLink  MISSING IN ACTION  , this week was pretty damn good. i mean, even though i cried myself to sleep for two weeks (sike!), cut my wrists more than usual (double-sike!), and received lots of bitchy voicemail, i think i'm a fuckin' trooper for surviving that shit. after all the asskicking is done by edgebrook, i'll head on over to the luxurious razo manor to have yet another goodass time doing who know's what. but i mean you can't beat having razo's butler pampering your ass as you demand ricecake after ricecake. i mean, the man has toilets made of  solid gold .  boys and girls, that's how you do it.   Update: my parents suck ass.

Sammy Hagar: My bad.      2. the organ that dudes think with.      If you kick a guy in the crotch, it gives them brain damage.      3. word used, usually by women, to describe something really cool...or really lame.

      holy hell i am bored out of my mind. so i was thinking, if a country is like in debt or running out of money, why don't they just make more? if no.2 pencils are the best, why aren't they called no.1 pencils? why isn't the number 11 pronounced onety-one?' if you choke a smurf, what color does it turn? how do "KEEP OFF GRASS" signs get where they are? why is cheese wrapped? why did kamikaze pilots wear helmets? why are hemorrhoids called "hemorrhoids" instead of "asteroids"? if you throw a cat out a car window does it become kitty litter? why there are interstate highways in hawaii? why they put braille dots on the keypads of drive-through ATMs? if fire fighters fight fire and crime fighters fight crime, what do freedom fighters fight? why does your nose run, but your feet smell? why doesn't glue stick to the inside of the bottle?

      today was a very challenging day. it pushed me to my limits. it tested my skills. throughout the day i endured 10 rigorous obstacles over a timespan of 4 hours. they are as follows:      navigating towards the snooty woodlands    reversing my course from north to south    switchin' lanes on 1-45 south    exploring the dangerous anacortes st.    chirpin' gears to pearland    surviving an hour with my grandma    pit-stopping at the luxurious razo manor    trying not to hydroplane on the gulf freeway    managing to breathe in a hot stuffy car with  no ac     having to piss like a racehorse from south houston to north houston    challenging? yes. impossible? no. many a person would die on such a quest, but me? no sir. OTSS.

      oh man. i evaded those people again.  see, chris johnson & co. came over to pick me up. thing is, he drives like shit. i can remember 4 times i've come close to dying while he was behind the wheel. i mean, if you can't drive, stay the hell out of the car, right?   so he's all, " Hey, come on let's go to Mike's house to film a fight scene for our movie ." i think to myself,  i don't wan't to be a part of this home-movie shit anymore. go fight your mom . so i get the phone and "call" my 'rents.   ok, so i've developed this little scheme of mine. i pretend to call my parents, pretend like they tell me no, pretend to get in an argument, and hang up(really). so he thinks i can't go anywhere cus my 'rents won't let me and he usually bails out. but really,  this cat doesn't get it.  i mean, it's cool he wants me to hang out and help with this movie shit, but i prefer to live to see 17. and still, he comes over all the time to ask me the same question:   "Dude Tim, can you come?"  no sir. not today.

      wow today was a pretty good/bad day. guys, i had this dream about  a certain girl . i think it was like a premonition or something, but it was a good-ass dream...yeah...anyway, so i wake up, scratch my balls, and go downstairs. lo and behold, jack in the box is sitting on the counter smelling pretty damn good, so i munch out. after that's all done, i look out the back window to check out the status of my badass tent. you see, i was planning on moving in today.  but the fucking wind blew it over.  i guess i didn't do such a good job setting it up.  i checked my email and my main man Razo hit me back which was pretty cool. after that i checked my voicemail and that stupid crazy-goat-girl left me a message saying " Hi Tim, it's Christine. Can you call me back? ", so out of common courtesy  i deleted it . she had been acting really bitchy towards me the last few days of skool, so i don't really care too much what she has to say.  so after all that drama i checked out the tube for a couple of hours. then the good news came: aldine independent skool district called my casa and told my 'rents that i  couldn't  be a part of carver's engineering program next year because i would be starting too late (11th grade). so that was the highlight of my day, being rejected from a skool for smartasses. on the downside, i have to stay in band, which means i have to see cggirl. but next year things won't be so bad because they're starting this new thing in band where everybody has 4th period as their band class. so that way we start marching at 1:00pm and get thru at 3:30pm instead of 5:00pm.  i think that's a bitchin' idea.     The Strokes - Hard To Explain   I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train I try but you see, it's hard to explain I say the right things, but act the wrong way I like it right here, but I cannot stay I watch the TV; forget what I'm told Well, I am too young, and they are too old The joke is on you, this place is a zoo You're right...it's true

      ok so check this shit out: i'm digging into my bowl of pretzels and it hits me:  HOW FUCKING AWESOME WOULD IT BE TO CAMP OUT IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD?!  so i went to the garage and got all that camping shit out and set it all up. so now i'm good to go. i just don't know if i'm crazy enough to spend like the whole week out there. no pc. no tv.  no tp . aaaah sike! so some jackass hid my bowl of icecream in the microwave today. i don't know if it was my asshole sister or my dad, but somebody will pay...   The Mighty Mighty Bosstones - Where'd You Go?   Checked the clock when I got home and realized I was alone. Sat for hours by the window wonderin' where did ya go? Couldn't eat or sleep at all took the pictures off the wall. Paced the place as time moves slow and I'm wondering Where did ya go? Where'd ya go? Where'd ya go? I wanna know! Lit a cigarette I couldn't smoke Wound the clock until it broke. Went to bed then took a shower, stared at TV for an hour. Did the dishes, made the bed. Read a book I never read. Any minute you will show and I'm wondering where did ya go? Where'd ya go? Where'd ya go? I wanna k now! I opened the fridge, I opened a beer, played a tape I couldn't hear. Emptiness began to grow and I'm wondering where did ya go? Watched the sun come up from the back stairs. Thought about the last few years. I lost control I screamed, I cried I punched a hole and went inside. Packed my things, called a friend. Wished this emptiness would end. Wrote a note then tore it up, poured the beer into a cup. Sat on the couch, drank it slow, wondering where did ya go? Realized I couldn't stay, I grabbed my things and went away. Where'd you go? Where'd you go? I wanna know!

      okay kids, i've come to realize that  sundays blow and always will blow.  i went to church this morning, it was hella gay, too many kids, the traffic...but there were some pretty hot girls there, fortunately for me. should i feel bad for scoping out girls at church? i mean, it's not like there's anything else to do there anyway. every sunday i lay around and do nothing...wait, that's actually  everyday.  sundays suck ass.

      ok, so i realized that the only way to get pictures to my blog was to go through some stupid P2P program called  Hello . the idea is that you instant message a machine and tell them what pic you want on your site, but how stupid is that?  i feel bad enough talking to myself  like i am now, but talking to a bot? even then, what says i'm going to have anything worth uploading, anyway?

       Speaking of SIZZLING... my skin is on fire. Or it was, anyway. Today was hotter than normal. I was pretty hot and sweaty, until it started raining. That's right baby, it was raining cats and dogs. I thought it was refreshing, until most (all) of the girls started nipping, then it just got ugly. Yeah, all the hot girls were in the gym twirling flags and the ooglay ones were outside with us. Then some lucky/brave freshman chump got in TROUBLE for grabbing some girl's rack. Yeah he ran a lap and then we voted him off the island. It got ugly, and it got ugly quick. They let us out early, so I'm glad I don't have to go back for the 1-5.  I was walking back from Alan's house after eating some pizza for lunch yesterday and I found  this  AWESOME watch. It was in the street near the 9th grade campus, so I was like YOINK! Yes, it really is purple like the one in the picture. But at least now I can stop asking people for the time. Some freshman is crying his/her eyes out looking for their watch right now.  Well, today is FRIDAY kids! You must know what that means! THE VILLAGE! That's what I'm talkin' about. I need to see that mess tonight. I just hope that it doesn't have some wack ending  urlLink like  Signs  did . That whole "alien-coming-out-of-nowhere-and-shooting-my-son" thing didn't fly with me. The Village looks cooler anyway.

      DID ANYONE SEE NIP/TUCK?! Man that's some crazy stuff. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE KNOCKED UP HIS BEST FRIEND'S WIFE 17 YEARS AGO!! If I was raising somebody else's kid for 17 years and I found out it wasn't mine... I'd kick some ass. And wtf is up with his hair? It's like part mohawk, but not part mohawk. It's stupid looking and it pisses me off every episode.    I should probably try to leave band out of my blogs but this really pissed me off today. We were marching in our block today and when I was going backwards 8 counts, I ran into Mr. Jones' dumbass. He goes, " You're too close to Irvin, Tim. " and I'm like whatever. But as I was finishing the last 4 counts, I took a look at Mr. Jones and realized he was mega fat. I think I was marching okay and the only reason I hit him was because he's so damn fat.    So today Alan came over. We were the only two people that didn't know we were being let out early at noon. Yesterday when they made the announcement I was too busy messing around in the uniform room... But anyway we headed back to my casa, ate some pizza(s), chicken, steak, ribs, noodles, etc. I didn't even know they still showed  urlLink Trigger Happy TV  anymore, but lo and behold it was on. I really missed that show.     I took my pops to the grocery store because my mom  absolutely  had to have some taco shells. It was horrible, a national crisis. A world without taco shells is chaos. My mom has this bad habit of needing one thing, but adding many other things to the grocery list. It was supposed to be an "In and Out" trip, so me and my dad decided to go. We keeps it real.    And that's how my day went. How was yours?

      Whaaaa what's going on?! Today was pretty shatty. I got a 'fro chop and I'm trying to get used to it. Apparently my head looks smaller when there isn't an assload of hair around my noggin. I had to readjust my hat cus it flew off my head when we had to run laps today. CRAZY MESS! I also have this Cookies and Punh line in my head. Mr. Jones and Mr. Wiener thought it would be pretty clever to make us say PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH. COOKIES AND. PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH. COOKIES AND COOKIES AND. PUNCH PUNCH etc. to help us count back and forth through the 4/4 and 3/8 measures. I hate to admit it, but it does. I don't even know why I give Mr. Tienor so much heat; he's actually a pretty cool guy. Jones on the other hand... I don't know about him. He's like a white dude trapped inside a big fat black guy's body. He talks too much and I wanna fall asleep when he's bitching about things. He makes us run laps when we fuck up on the field (parking lot) or during rehearsal, but I think if he ran our laps for us, since it's a hellava lot, I'm sure he'd lose some weight. Who knows, maybe he'd be less bitchy.    Man I drove home for lunch and to my dismay we didn't have anything to eat... or so I thought. I checked the fridge in the garage and it was stocked with pizza and icecream: two of the things they tell us not to eat before we march. So of course I ate them, with pride. I also chugged down a DP instead of drinking water, like I'm s'posed to.    There's not much to my summer anymore now that stupid band has taken over. One more week. That's all I have to take for now. I watched Cabin Fever when I got home. It was pretty stupid, with one of those endings like from 28 Days Later; it was gay and made no sense. But it made me wish I could get some disease from the sun, to make my skin like  urlLink this  or  urlLink this.  That way I wouldn't have to march like all the other weenies.

        Blink 182 - Untitled     I think of awhile ago    We might have had it all    I was so stupid then    You needed time to grow      But now just as things change    As well my feelings do    In time things rearrange    I am so sick of chasing you      But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose    You make me regret those times I spent with you    And playing those games as I wait for your call    And now I give up, so goodbye and so long      It's not a change of pace    This time I'll get it right    It's not a change of taste    I was the one there last night      You have your other friends    They were there when you cried    Didn't mean to hurt you then    Best friends just won't leave your side      But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose    You make me regret those times I spent with you    And playing those games as I wait for your call    And now I give up, so goodbye and so long      It's not a change of pace    This time I'll get it right    It's not a change of taste    I was the one there last night      When I needed you most    When I needed a friend    You let me down now    Like I let you down then      So sorry, it's over...

      Aaaah these last few days have really bit the big one. As you may know, summer band has started. So far, it's hella gay.  Our new drum majors are gay . Our schedule is gay. Our "new" baritone player is also gay. He's semi-new because the bastard switched from trumpet; I mean, who the hell does that? I'll tell you who: our "new" gay baritone.     Yeah the new drum majors (3) really get on my nerves. They let all their new found power go straight to their heads.  They're ordering us around and making everyone run laps and making us stand at attention with our horns up for very long periods of time. I mean, if I was playing the flute or the piccolo I wouldn't complain, but  marching baritones are really fucking heavy . Plus I'm not exactly happy to do that  when the three fatass drum majors need more exercise than I do.     Well, crazyass FFA goat girl and her friend are really pissed at me cus I didn't return any of their calls this summer, but I don't care. They look weird. It's not a huge loss anyway, because.... they look weird.    They started this donation thingy for each section. See, we're supposed to donate money to some dude so he can make the last day of summer band  really cool  and buy food for everyone and stuff, so he tells us the section that gave the most mula would get to eat before everyone. Since both the trombone and the baritone section are small compared to the assload of trumpet, saxophone, clarinet, flute, french horn, and tuba sections, we both joined forces and gave a crapload of cash. Yeah we heard that the saxes gave $19.34, so we were like droppin' cash like nobody's business. We gave a total of  $59.17 , from only 8 people. I myself actually only gave $3, but hey, it's the thought that counts. Yeah so all you saxes out there, watch out. I'll kick your ass.    I think the only good thing about band so far is the color guard. And I mean  good . Yeah the new freshman chix are pretty and hot, not to mention pretty hot. Wow that makes me sound like a pedophile, I'm all like old and stuff. Seriously, I think some of them are quite possibly non-freshman, if it makes me sound less  urlLink pedophileyish .     I actually had fun, on my way to band, during lunch, and on my way home. That's because I was driving!! Yeah all by myself lol. It was pretty damn cool. Shh! Don't tell anybody: I only have my permit... But when October rolls around, I'll be 100% legal, baby.    Well, I can't wait for next week. More band.  More asshole drum majors . More color guards.

      Since my summer kinda ends in one more day, I think I'd like to take this time to look over some of the better things that happened over my summer. Even at the very beginning I was sure it would be a huge wasted boring summer, and for the most part I was right. Not much happened around these parts, and I think I would have been having more fun if I didn't live here. I do think I'd be much happier back at my old casa, even though it was small and shitty.  I wouldn't have to worry about homemade explosives, crazy FFA stalkers,   the most horrible band on the planet   , receiving one too many voicemails, calls from multiple teeny-boppers, trying to make something impossible work between two completely different people, ect . BUT, there's not much I can do; I can't pack up and move by myself, abandon my familia like that, so I'll just walk this whole thing off. September makes a whole year that I've been living in north Houston, and I figure if I can make it for a year, I can make it until I graduate. I'm ready to pack my shit and get out of here.    On the flipside of things,  urlLink Firefox  got an update. As Razo and I both know,  Mozilla Firefox is superior to Internet Explorer in every way . And anyone that doesn't use it ought to. And if they refuse, they should be shot. There's one good thing about my summer...    I bought some new batteries for my keyboard (WOOT!). Now I'm jammin' up a storm...even though I don't know what notes I'm playing. Whoever invented Treble Cleff should be shot.    My Asian homie from down south got me into this game called Gunbound. I wasn't too sure about it at first, I mean it just looked like some weird crazyass Asian hobby. But after messing around with it for an hour I actually thought it was a pretty sweet game. Then an hour turned into 10 and I was losing sleep. It reminds me of that old skool Cannon game all the "cool" people, including myself, used to run off of floppies on Mr. Carbajal's computers back in the day. I never liked that dude; he reminded me of a carnie because he smelled bad. Holy hell, that was the 7th grade. I'm getting old kids :(          urlLink             I learned a new phrase that I plan on using a lot more.  "Fuck the fuck off."  So when CrAzY goat-girl comes around during camp asking me out again and again I'm just going to have to look her straight in the eye(s) and say, "Hey, fuck the fuck off." Thanks Nancy.    Well tonight is THE last night (excluding Friday and Saturday nights) I'll be able to stay up til the wee hours of the morning for the next two weeks. And I have nothing to thank but Mr. Band. Thank you Mr. Band, for robbing me of my summer freedom.     At least it gives me something to do... cus I am  hella  bored.

      I just woke up about three minutes ago.  Somehow I got tricked into going fishing last night/this morning.  It was a huge waste of time and I didn't catch sqaut . I used the same shrimp the whole time and never had to replace it because those ungrateful fish never wanted any of the goods. Ugh I have a headache. I feel like  urlLink this .

      Even though Razo's pretty jealous of my wallpaper that I made all by myself, I've decided to share it with the masses.   Here   you go world.

      Okay, this is weird. This new interface is like baffling the hell out of me. Well, I figure if Blogger can clean up their posting interface, I might as well clean myself up.   Grammar  and punctuation wise  .  Haha! I mean, it's the least I can do. Plus typing like I did before made me look stupider than I really am. We can't have that now, can we?   Lately I've been having some weirdass flashbacks. Like I was young and had good intentions, but I remember my mom was going through some crap about her weight. So this one time I was like,  "Hey Mom, it doesn't matter how fat you are, I still love you."  She told me,  "Oh,  thanks  Timmy."  You have to realize that a 6 year old does not know what  sarcasm  is. I mean, I took it as oh hey she appreciates my semi-compliment. It took many years later to realize that she was being a smartass about it and in no way intended to like what I said. That is  NOT  cool Mom. It's also funny how sarcasm has become a part of my life. I think it's all her fault.   There was this other time, in elementary... I was chillin' at recess, you know, loving nature and stuff. So I pick up my rollie pollie friend in my hand and I'm like,  "Hey man, how's it going?"  And the meanest ass girl from Africa comes up to me. She was a long-time rival of mine, I don't know why, but I never liked her. She picked on my poor ass too much. Anyway, she goes,  "What is that?"  So I hold my hand out and I say,  "It's a rolli-"   BAM!  She knocks that crap towards my face and guess where Mr. Rollie Pollie goes? That's right, in my mouth. Down my damn throat. One of these days, I'm gonna get her. Sleep with one eye open...   I remember this one weirdass dream I had when I was about 6. Whoooo it was a spooky one! I think my mom forced me to wash my sheets, something about me being dirty, and so she took my sheets and threw them in the washer. So it gets pretty late. She tells me to go get them out of the washer  cus  because they're done, but I'm too lazy. I decided that it would be okay to fall asleep on my matress and have no worries about fumbling with sheets or comforters or pillows. I woke up pretty early in the morning. Or at least I thought I woke up. See, my night-light was on, illuminating one wall and casting some SPOOKY shadows. And all of a sudden, I'm levitating, towards my door, into the hallway towards what should've been the living room, only it was infinitely black... And like other dreams, you try to scream but nothing comes out. And then I'm back on my bed. Cheese and rice I'm getting chills thinking about it. So remember kids, always listen to your mother and  PUT YOUR DAMN SHEETS ON YOUR BED.    Oh yeah, I remember this other time, I was being a geek and I was like up at 2 in the morning boring people with my dreams... Oh, wait, that's not a flashback, it's a flashnow.   Well, my summer as I know it is nearing it's end. Thanks to band. Because Nimitz has the best band program in the universe. Shyeah, right. No, really, there is the need to start summer band early because... oh, I can feel it... yeah, we're gonna get straight one's this year at UIL. Like that's really gonna happen. This band hasn't gotten a 1 since 1999. I mean at least my other school won shit occasionally.                     urlLink

      well my weekend was pretty chill. i went down south (to my roots) and visited some cool ass people. the first cool thing that happened to me was the  world premiere of a brand spankin' new edgebrook song . now that shit was the shit.  after all that ass kicking was over, we walked our bum asses to john's house for some semi-gaming. i wasn't really into cus i suck at halo. but the  9 or so kittens  he had lying around were pretty entertaining, so you know...i was entertained. and the whole while everyone's hungry and we don't know what to do cus we're all bums without cars and we ended up taking the  pata mobile and heading on over to WOK DELIGHT (whoop whoop). actually it was pretty bad, i mean from the young asian prostitutes serving you to the flies to the unfortunate fortunes. speaking of which, how often do two ordinary people sitting right next to each other get the exact same fortune on the exact same day at the exact same hour?! cus me and john got this mess:  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You have an optimistic faith and confidence in life.  so of course you know i keeps it real and we DEMAND a new fortune cookie or else we were gonna bring the house down. so the like 5 year old cashier gives in and gives us our fresh new fortunes. now that's what i'm talking about. we gets ours.  so on the road again. we walk our asses to value village, the  coolest  clothing store on the planet and check out some "new" threads. well, i find  urlLink these  badass shades and an awesome national honor society polo. keep in mind that these clothes are "previously worn" but still hold a certain sentimental value. haha that polo was more like "previously assed" cus it sure smelled like it. but it's all good, i spent $1.60 on the polo and .60¢ on the glasses, coming to a grand total of $1.52 (tax included). you must be saying to yourself, "What-Whaaaaaat?! But $1.60 + .60¢ = $2.20 TIM!"  apparently the woman working the register wasn't qualified enough to operate it properly. just goes to show you how much skool should be first in your life. well, i'm not complaining. you girls out there that spend lots of mula can learn a thing or two about saving money from  urlLink this guy .  and BAM i'm back at the razo mansion. razo's crackin' the whip, telling me to fix his damn computer. and since i'm not looking to hurt the guy, i do as i'm told. so we watch the Reel Big Fish DVD to pass the time it took me to kick his computer's ass. whooo it took longer than i thought; that mofo was on all night updating as slow as hell and stupid me i'm right behind it making sure it's okay for the  entire  night while razo caught up on his beauty sleep. that's right, i haven't been asleep for 24 hours kids. and you know what a lack of sleep can do to you, right? it'll make you do some crazy shit. like taking pictures of yourself:   urlLink     is that...sunlight?    urlLink     check out my buddy holly spectacles    urlLink     this bandana is gangsta   so sleep when you can or  urlLink this  will happen to you! when razo finally wakes up he's like "What the fuck bitch hurry the hell up with my computer!"  and i start like rushing cus he's dangerous like that. after a while we decide to catch a flick (Anchorman). it was pretty funny, i dug it. we had to wait outside to get picked up and some pregnant chix were checkin' out razo and i had to like kick them in the stomachs to get them away from the poor guy. and then razo's wonderful mother gives me a ride home.  i finally get home and the first thing i did was shat. i'm not too fond of dropping bombs in other people's houses, so i waited til i was back home and kept it real in my own bathroom. this concludes my kickass weekend. oh yeah i got this awesome song by  urlLink Andy Hunter . it's called Go.  note to self: get a car.

           urlLink    wow kids. i had this mad-crazy dream. so i'm back in tacotown, standing by a payphone near Colonel Audio and Video (that building that purposely looks like crap). so of course the phone rings, and you know i pick it up. Operator: "Get those mp3s out of there before it's too late!!     Me: "Uhhh, what?"     Operator: "Get those files to the safehouse immediately!!"     [Click]      at that point i'm like wtf?! and when i notice the straps on my body connected to a backpack i didn't even know was there, i'm like wtf?! and when i open the backpack and see actual mp3 files...i'm like WTF?!      now this backpack seems familiar to me.  very  familiar. wow it's the backpack that was like stolen from me in the sixth grade at soho intermediate!! man that was a cool backpack.      so these punks come from out of nowhere and they're like  "Give me your backpack or we'll kick your ass!"  so then i just start running cus...let's face it, i'm a lover, not a fighter. and eventually they catch up to me and we end up under some bleachers...don't ask...and it's like showtime.      at that point i figure if i can carry a fucking computer file in my backpack, i better be able to do some kickass kung fu. and what do you know i'm kicking ass left and right for like 10 minutes. i mean it was so cool it's indescribable. i wish i could've taped it or something...      anyway after i a while i start running again and i see this giant bush/shrub thingy so i run into it and climb like hella fast over the entrance. and i wait. and wait. finally one of the dudes comes in and i'm like BAMA! so he's dead and this continues until they're all dead and i finally walk out of the mysterious bush.      so i'm walking and i'm walking and i finally get to this farm/ranch thing and i chill out there along the fence. and up comes this girl i knew a long time ago and even though she's not hot in real life she was pretty damn hot in my dream. what can i say, my dreams rule. anyway she's all hot and stuff and you know me with my lack of self esteem...  yeah and then those damn dogs wake my ass up cus they started barking at like 5am. stupid dogs. and you know how you can't exactly pick up where you left off in a dream, so i was pretty much SOL.  damn dirty dogs.

      this was definitely a day of shits-and-giggles.  it all started this morning, or at noon i should say. i'm pretty mad that my pops thinks i need to bust my ass some more in the yard. last week i mowed, edged, swept, and dumped a shitload of sand in low spots in our backyard, get this, ALL BY MYSELF kids! anyway he was like,  "Arrr! Go set these bricks up! Aaah! Do it now! Because I'm crazy! Aaah!"  so i'm like whatever and i do it to get the guy off my back.  so then chris johnson & co. swing by and he's all like,  "Hey man, I bought an crapload of fireworks, come check them out later man!"  then he asks me for an empty water bottle, and i'm like WTF? so i tell him no and he leaves.  so after i'm through working he comes around again. this time matt comes out and he's like,  "Let's go!"  and i'm all  "NO!"  so he's like see you later and they leave. so then my 'rents are all asking me why i didn't want to go and i just told them i didn't feel like it and they said that's why i don't have friends. so they give me the guilt trip until i finally get the keys and head on over to his house.  on the way i'm pretty pissed cus my rage against the machine cd won't play in the fucking radio. so i turn on thorne dr. and stomp down on the gas; it was pretty funny. so i finally get to his 'hood and eventually to his house and i see that fat tuba guy from band standing in his front yard.  so i park the car and i go up to him and ask  "What's up?"  and he's like,  "Chris and some other guy were making fireworks and one exploded and him and the other guy are all burned, like 2nd degree burns, I'm waiting out here for the ambulance."  just then mike comes up and we're all standing around. so we finally go inside and chris is like all red and that other dude is on the couch like screaming. so i'm thinking that i need to bail, and i need to bail fast.  and like clockwork the constable and the ambulance team show up. so everyone in the house gets rounded up in his backyard and  The Man 's all like,  "Okay, I don't need any shit-stupid stories. What the hell happened here?"  so me and mike don't even know what to say, so we stay out of it. then gerold the tuba guy tells him they were making bombs out of ozarka bottles. so he's all like,  "Okay, you all need to get some parents up here. Now."   then  The Man  calls the  ARSON INVESTIGATOR .  so by now i'm pretty pissed i'm there cus i have nothing to do with anything. aften like two hours sitting on chris' back deck getting bitten by mosquitoes, they finally let us go. so i walk out and there's like a news crew and my 'rents and the arson investigator. so he lets everyone know that  we're all convicted of being accomplices to arson , and that we need to come to his office this week and give a written statement to prove otherwise. so i'm like,   "Kiss my ass, Johnny Q. Law! "Okay sir, I'll be there."  and my 'rents are all like sorry for forcing me off my ass and i'm like,  "WHATEVA!" "It's okay. No problem."   so i get my ass in the car i'm not even supposed to be driving without my license and take off. i get home, i launch some firecrackers, i put out some fires, i sweep up my mess, i come in, i eat, and here i am.  this has been one helluva day.

        The Postal Service - Natural Anthem    I'll write you a song and it won't be hard to sing  It will be a natural anthem, familiar it may seem  It will rally all the workers on strike for better pay  And its chorus will resound and boost morale throughout the day     I'll write you a song and I hope that you won't mind  Because all the names and places I have taken from real life  So please don't be upset at this portrait that I paint  It may be a little biased, but at least I spelt your name right...

      Today was sweet! First period I had English DC and we did nothing! Next I had US History with this cool bald teacher! After that I had  awesome  BCIS! I went to B lunch and there were no stupid sophmores cus I ran 'em all down! I had a fish basket! For only  $1.50 ! I sat with one  coolass colorguard ! She was cool! I went back to BCIS! She gave us a pop quiz! It was over the toolbar buttons in MS Word and also  the difference between a mouse and a keyboard ! It was easy (for me)! I finished in under a minute! Everyone hated me! I laughed my ass off all the way to my seat! The bell rang! I went to band! We played our show! No outside practice until Monday! Someone stole my coordinate sheet... But it's OKAY! I lied to Mr. Jones and told him I saw one of the janitors throw it away! He gave me another one! Bwahaha!  I'm getting duped into some  Gayliens Vs. Gaydator  tonight. That's so wrong. It'll probably be like  Freddy Vs. Gayson , and by that I mean the same director probably directed it. And by that I mean it's probably gonna suck. And by that I mean it looks gay. In fact, I can't choose which one looks gayer. Thus,  Gayliens Vs. Gaydator   VS.   Freddy Vs. Gayson .

           Oh SNAP! TODAY WAS AWESOME! No, not really...    Fall Semester :  1A - English 3 Dual Credit 1B - Physics (Honors) 2A - Pre-Cal (Honors) 2B - US History (Honors) 3 - BCIS 4 - Wind Ensemble   My schedule isn't bad, it's just that I've been forced into BCIS. That class is so stupid. Not to mention slow. Basically the teacher glorifies MS Office and tries to make it seem like a fun suite of applications, but everyone knows Word is as lame as  urlLink this  dog. I mean, I'm like a few steps ahead of everybody in the room, including the Teach.  Lunch was also pretty bad, thanks largely in part to the stupid sophmores. Actually they're  still  just stupid fish, only they're in the 10th grade. Bastards. They were holding up the damn lunch line because they didn't know their PIN numbers. "Oh, miss, I don't know my pin number," was said about a thousand times before I made it to the ca$h register. Pygmies!  I saw my favorite colorguard had B lunch and I hung out with her and her friends. I'm talkin' about  urlLink SCHWING !  More as it develops.

      New song; how appropriate.  This morning me and Jim-E stayed up whupping some ass on  urlLink Gunbound . See, I can never sleep night before some big event, i.e. the first day-o-school. I stayed up until 4AM, then woke my ass up at 10AM to be sure that I'll be hella tired by the time I go to bed.  Last night my dad made hot dogs but I got this  ingenous  idea to heat up some tortillas and put them in there instead of the stupid buns. It was grand.  Yesterday what's-her-face called me again. Wooo I'm truly the greatest guy.  I  answered the phone and told her  I  was unavailable because  I  was taking a shower. She asked  me  if  I  could tell  me  to call her back later. How stupid do you have to be to not recognize the difference between  me  and  me  on the phone?  And now I give you random pictures of elephants:

      One more day of freedom before I'm enslaved by the education system. School starts the 12th. That's Thursday. The day after tomorrow. At 7:20. A.M.  Last night I stumbled upon The Ultimate Van Halen Collection: 15 cds. Then I made my own Louis Vuitton wallpaper in Photoshop. Looks good tiled.    urlLink

      I've had a very bad shoe experience over the last few days. All I wanted were some zapatos and instead I got  crap atos.  It was a bright and sunny day. "I wonder what cool shit they have on  urlLink Vans.com ,"said I. So there I was, there they were. I saw some nice kicks and I was like, "Charge that shit!" I mean, I wasn't asking for much:

         Woot!    urlLink        Chronic Future - Time and Time Again   Inspiring, shining, rising And when you're in my way I'm not dividing me from you cause we're working together Perfect in its splendor like the currents of the weather The splinter in my center hindering all of my pleasure Is me manifested as you in this endeavor Once responsibility is taken I can render Experience to be however I want to remember  Time and time again we fall in to the depths of who we are But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find  Put yourself through the scariest of scenarios Enter experiences you normally wouldn't dare to go It's all for the character and the aroogant afterglow Of knowing it's appearance according to your patterns of growth And what your parents handed down to you to handle Make sure you carry torches when their puttin out your candles Prediction can be unkind but unwind them still Don't erase the part of you that's responsible for your will  Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are But you can't keep running away from what wou're trying to find  Well I've seen you and those things you do And the way you hide that shadow can't be good for you Your dark defines your light  There's some utterly damaged particles to deal with And if I stutter I'm sorry but it's hard to feel swift When stuck in my stomach is a cannon ball anchor to life I've been pushing it down pretending it doesn't exist Well this is what happens when you're pissed about being pissed You dig yourself so deep you resist just to resist And there's no way to get back experiences you missed So start right now today and risk furiousness for bliss  Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find

      My dad woke me up to cut the  yard  at 9 this morning. His excuse was that it was nice and cloudy and that I probably wouldn't sweat. I decided I needed to transfer some new jams to my walkman, since the songs I had on there were pretty old. So after I... how should I say...  aquired    7 new cds (in .mp3 format of course), I set out on my quest to cut the  yard . It was 3pm by the time I got out there.  I got some kerazy phone calls lately. Some  weirdo  from the the other side of the world called a few days ago. This other dude wanted to know if Carlos (?) lived here. And lastly, some chica wanted to know if I wanted to subscribe to Vibe.

      Aaaaah today sucked. On the plus side, band's over. On the not-plus side, I'm really tired.  I gave a couple of piggyback rides and it turned out to be a not so good idea. Yeah we were going downhill through some bush to the field and all the sticks like slapped my legs on the way down. There are like a million scratches on my ankles. But my passenger thought it was pretty funny, so I guess it was all for a good cause. We had some hella gay water balloon fight outside. It actually wasn't even a water ballon  fight , we all just kinda stood around while the stupid officers threw water balloons at us from the truck. I gave up after about five minutes and decided to leave. Those stupid weenies. They hyped everyone up like it was gonna be cool and it was just another letdown.  All that money I gave towards the end-of-band picnic was wasted too. The food sucked. I want my $13.67 back.  I got my schedule last night at school. I have two alternating classes, which is a  bitch . It's cool, at least I got everything I wanted. I'm just a little nervous because I've heard bad things about 3 of my teachers. But what can you do, huh?  ------  I noticed this colorguard today. A  certain  colorguard. Orange hat. Flag. Pole. Hair... I thought she looked pretty hot. I talked to her, but I forgot what about. OMG I forgot her name.   Haha she had Mudd on her hat.

      Whoo today reminds me of one of those  urlLink Rocky and Bullwinkle  episodes. It's been all fast-paced since 8 this morning. I rolled to band, marched  The Box  like a thousand and 2 times. I hate  The Box . It sounds sinister,  The Box  does. You know why? It's one of Satan's creations... yeah he decided to make something completely lame and boring, so he created  The Box . What a weenie.  Last night I saw  The Village . It really pissed me off. M. Night Shinanigans or whoever should have just called it Signs 2: The Sequel cus it really bit the big one. Aah listen to me, just LISTEN! Don't waste your money... and if you still want to see it, go watch it at Willowbrook Mall, cus those hotties are HOT. And at the theater, those hotties are even hotter!! To bad I'm like fugly because man... they were like unreal.  I had authentic fried rice today. Mike Sinabe got his mom to make shrimp fried rice (at my request) and we dug into it at Alan's for lunch. It was  damn  good.  Wow man the cheerleaders came out to practice outside. Then get this: the colorguard came out after them... I was confused! I couldn't choose which group to stare at more... I like fell down on the cement and started foaming at the mouth and going into convulsions. Sike! I actually got a spot in the show, but I wasn't really proud of myself. I think they put me in there by default; two of the other four baritones really  urlLink suck . No doubt dawg, no doubt.  I took a shower when I got home at 5:30 because I smelled like  BOOTY  .  I changed my threads and there was like a  James Coney Island  box  on the counter, so of course I was all over that shit  like a hobo on a ham sandwich .  Well we have some gayass attempt to get our 'rents involved in the Band Boosters tonight. They call it a concert, I call it a scam. Either way, it's a waste of my time.  I better get going so I can continue to pick on the freshman before they get there. I need some gas.  DUCE!!
