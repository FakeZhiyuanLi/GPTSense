      I've had a reasonably good day today. Woke up this morning a bit perkier, probably because the new boys were back after a couple of days on external training, and I knew that they'd cheer me up. And I have been having good hair days the last couple of days, which is excellent because it rarely happens to me. Anyway so I felt kind of pretty today...despite the fact that I got into work and realised I'd put on a belt instead of a skirt, seriously need to get myself a full length mirror so that i notice these things before I leave for work...either that or try clothes on before I buy them so I know what they look like on, rather than wearing them for the first time when I'm in a rush for work and bearly have time to zip them up before I run out of the door...anyway, I guess at least it gave the boys something to look at (not that my legs are the nicest in the world)   So I emailed the new boys quite a bit today, playing the question game which was really fun. I love getting to know new people, it's so cool and the first few months knowing someone is probably the only time I actually feel interesting around other people.   I just saw Troy with Helen from work...excellent film, definitely worth seeing for those that haven't seen it yet.  Next week Paul is away all week and Stu is on holiday, I'm going to be all by myself and I'm going to certainly try my hardest to be strong and not pathetic like I usually am when I'm by myself. I wish so much I could be by myself, I guess if I had that quality my life would be a million different, huh?  xx

      Ok, so I was just chatting to fnw, and you know what? People just make me insane. Like I have Paul, so it's not going to kill me, but he just spent practically the whole conversation talking about a girl he met on Saturday night and I'm just sitting here thinking 'you're supposed to like me'. And then he said a bunch of stuff that made me realise that it was just an ego boost to him!!! Like he said that I believed in him and cheered him...oh yay for me! Is that all I am? Someone to dole out crappy advice to people and make them feel good about themselves? Sorry but that doesn't sound so attractive to me right now.   AND then the people who actually give me something back I kind of find it hard to hold onto, maybe because I drain them the way that other people drain me. I mean not that people drain me, I like that people talk to me about their problems, and I know that people are there for me too, I'm just being a martyr, and I need to cut it out.   I'm an ego boost?!!!??!!!!! What the hÂ£ll is that all about??!! I'm so angry. And when I think about it, he's not the only one who uses me like that! And here I am being all 'oh yay they like me' when who in the world am i trying to kid?   Ok so now that I've got that out I'm going to step back and breathe, tomorrow is a new day and I'm going to try my very very hardest to snap myself out of this sickening self pity thing.   LOL bet you're loving the blogs at the mo, huh? Oh and also, poor poor dumb Michelle being up for eviction only because Becky nominated her...and I bet she goes too...poo.   Still....please please please vote for Marco to be evicted (09011 21 44 06 or text MARCO to 84444)   ;) xx

      HURRAH!!! THEY'VE SEEN THROUGH MARCO!!!!!!!  I am so pleased that he and Nadia are up for eviction..though I feel sorry for Michelle because I think it's probably going to be her to be evicted. Oh well, at least I'll get to see her go...and if it's Marco I can boo. If it's Nadia I wont though because she doesn't deserve that. Marco does though, he's such a freak and so manipulative, I mean wtf is wrong with that man? Eugh @ the drama queen freakzoid.    PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Vote for Marco to be evicted!!!!!!! 09011 21 44 06 or text MARCO to 84444!!!  xx

      Ok so either my next door neighbours are having a marathon sex session or the woman is being murdered...it's 17.55, just noting the time in case I need it for a police investigation, in which case I am soooo not trying to make a joke out of the noises coming from next door, it's just a bit suspicious, that's all.   Now, what did I get up to today? OMG I was sooooooo having the fun this morning, my manager had some police tapes that needed to be listened to and so me and a new girl who started yesterday but who has some PI claim experience, she's called Emma btw, got to listen to the tapes, pick out the salient points and then give our recommendations. It was sooo cool and interesting. And funny, cos the man being interviewed was so lying out of his teeth...though of course for confidentiality reasons I can't go into too much detail lol ;)  I'm such a crappy pathetic girl and now I'm stuck with bluesdoms big time and I don't know what to do to hike myself out of the ditch i am so comfortably rutted in, because it's just pooey, like nothing's right and even when someone does something nice I just know they're only doing it because I've made them feel they have to, not because they want to, and I feel like screaming for someone to just want me, even though I know it's not about that at all. I guess we all feel lonely and misunderstood sometimes. Eugh. I keep coming back to feeling like this. I think it's just there's a few things that have been pooey, most of them I have no intention of talking about on here, even if getting it out would help...see when you get to the point where you just want to wallow in your own self pity?  AND a stupid lorry pulled out in front of me, blatantly, at a roundabout on my way home today. Luckily because I'm dealing with motor claims all day long I'm very aware of what other cars are doing on the road because I've convinved myself that I'm going to have an accident, so I just stopped and let him...BUT he was going so slowly and was very long and it did actually annoy me, which is not so good because I so don't get angry when I'm driving, apart from when people don't indicate, but that's just cos it's plain rude.   There's a fly on my foot and I have no idea how it is breathing with the smell...my feet are so stinky the last couple of days. Oh, I suppose that flies hang around garbage all day usually so smell's probably not such a big issue with them, huh? Can flies even smell? They freak me out because they bite...do flies suck your blood?   Um...today I chatted to an old friend on the phone for a while, until we got cut off, then I was worried that my work had spotted it wasn't a work related call so I was too scared to call back. It was good to catch up though. Really good. I was a bit, as in very, worried about them because they were having a few health things going on last time i heard from them, but they seem fine now, and exactly the same actually, in fact it was all just the same, you know?  I need to finish our crappy pooey crappy accounts tonight, which is just pooey. I feel so old like all I'm here for at the mo is doing housework and watching TV and doing pooey accounts. Luckily Helen and I are going to see the 5pm showing of Troy tomorrow, and I can't wait, not because of the film, but you know how i feel about the cinema. I think I just get too bored too easily and then i don't know what to do with myself so i think too much about stuff then it brings me down. I should try harder to keep active perhaps.   Ok I'm going to edit this, then post it, then I'm going to get a cupasoup, then watch BBLB, then take a bath, then do the accounts. Wish me luck!  xx

      I've got the blues. Luckily I see it not lasting long becuase tomorrow I am going to the pictures with Helen to see Troy, then Thursday we're going to the annual company cricket match against a well known firm of solicitors, which I'm actually looking forward to, despite the cricketness of it, because it'll be good to get to know people out of work. Then Friday I'm going to see Big Brother with Helen and 2 of her friends, which I'm not so much looking forward to per se, but it should be a laugh anyway. I wonder who's up for eviction...I predict Victor, Jason andd Ahmed. Though I wish it would be Marco freak boy and Nadia. Though I wouldn't mind if Victor goes, he bores me now, which is a shame as at first i thought he was funny.  Eugh i hate having a pooey blue cloud over my head. AAARRRRRGGGGHHHHH! At least if there was something concrete wrong with something then I'd be able to articulate it, the blues are good in songs, but never quite as cool when you've got them yourself.   Ok it's my late night tonight, which means I can stay here a bit longer, though I've been up early this morning still because we have a house inspection today and couldn't be bothered to clean last night so I did it this morning instead. We need a new vacuum cleaner desperately. Wonder if they'll notice the blue stain.  Also, I'm joining up to the company pension scheme today. I had a chat wit the rep yesterday then talked it through with paul last night and yay I'm getting a pension. OMG that's so grown up and scarey. Being old scares me, because I really don't want to loose my teeth, and the wrinkles thing, i hate wrinkly arms, i need to not get old, because I feel bad enough now that my life is still, think about how obsessed with it all i'm going to feel when I'm actually old...OMG I swear I will not be able to cope if i lose my teeth.   Ok I'm going to take a bubblebath and read. xx

      Today is reality tv forum's 6 month anniversary. I remember when I put that in the planner how much i was hoping that we'd make it, how full of love and enthusiasm i was for it all. I guess for the last month or so that I was really into it, it was for the wrong reasons, because I was letting myself be influenced by people who are maybe not the sanest in the world. As soon as I really distanced myself from everything to do with that I realised that a long time ago I stopped feeling the same way about the forum, stopped needing it, and even stopped wanting it as much. It's for the best, therefore, that we've stepped down as admin. It's scarey for me though, because I guess I depended on the forum to kind of keep me alive inside when I was working from home. I know that others think i'm sad for this, but I really cared about it all, and so I'm really quite sad today that I've passed it over, I mean i know the people who have taken over will do brilliantly, and will be able to dedicate a lot more time than we've been able to the last few months, but still, sometimes you know something logically but it takes you a little while to catch up with that thought. So for now I think I'll just be sad.   I'm blurry in my head the last few days, not knowing whether certain things mean what i think they mean, knowing that they don't and yet not knowing what to do if they do, and whether it even needs to, or will, make any difference.  So, I think I should go take a bath, because I love lying in the bath and reading with loads of big bubbles xx

      I guess a good morning is in order...Good morning. I just wrote a really long and complicated blog. But sooo not the right place.   I don't have much to say in that case, um...yesterday I cooked dinner and got up to date with my letter writing. I love writing letters.  Blue stain on the floor not that bad I think...house inspection tomorrow so we'll see!  I'm going shopping after work tonight, purely for some blouses for work because practically all of my clothes now are too big for me. All of my trousers keep falling down, which is obviously good, but it doesn't look the coolest having to hike my trousers up all of the time, but I don't want to spend too much money on new clothes because the plan is to lose more weight...and so I'm putting up with my trousers falling down.   OK I keep writing stuff I don't want to say so I'm going to go take a bath...have a great day peeps.   xx

      It just took me about a year to get on here, and now that it's working i need to start my accounts stuff.  Pooey accounts. It's so weird how something can put such a cloud over your head. I swear if i mess them up today I'll, well i wont actually do anything really, i'll go in a huff and say i'm not going to look at them again, and then next weekend i'll have another go and fuck it up yet again and this will continue for all of eternity, punishment for my sins. OMG is that what this account thing is? If so then bravo to the person who thought of that, a very suiting punishment indeed.  I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright!   I have a Tesco delivery coming here between 11am and 1pm...it's now 12.56pm...wonder if they'll get here in time. If they don't it's the first time they've ever been late. I wonder if that'll ruin my faith in them forever, but I doubt that it'll be that bad....oh now it's 13.00. Well, that's kind of pooey, huh? Um...I'm going to check my confirmation email that I did actually order it....   OMG What a mess....it's now 14.03...and I have just had an amazing amount of fun...NOT! First, I decided to call Tesco to find out what was holding them up...oh excuse me i need to clean the keyboard.....  Ok I'm back...anyway, so I called them and it turns out that Kingston depot had 2 vans break down so they had to bunk everything along, hence the delay. Although it was totally no problem because we're not going out today anyway, it really annoys me the lack of customer service that places think they can give out. I mean what hassle to make a quick phone call just to let us know? See, that's just pooey to care so little...i know it sooo doesn't matter, but in a way it kind of does, because it's the little things that make all of the difference. Anyway, just as I hung up the phone, the van pulled up outside of our house, obviously, because that's always the way. I told Paul that he had to bring the shopping in, but he was busy upstairs, and obviously I didn't want them to leave thinking that we weren't in...so I decided to just do it myself.   There was so much stuff and I was trying to carry in as much as I could...stupidly...and in one of the carrier bags was a big bottle of Comfort Easy Iron...I decided it would be fun not to hold that bag properly, and then to drop it, and then just stand there and watch as the whole 2l bottle (save a tiny bit at the bottom) spilled all over the sofa, the carpet, the walls, the door...very nice. So there I am, screaming at Paul to come down and sort it, whilst trying to act liek nothing's wrong to the Tesco man, because I'm a wuss and didn't want to look stupid like i can't even carry a carrier bag properly, and Paul's saying he'll be down in a mo...I was not the happiest, I can tell you.  So, as I was cleaning it up, (or trying to anyway, we now have a blue stain on the carpet, which goes wonderfully with all of the red stains that are already there) I realised, that sometimes you just know that something is someone else's fault, even when you have no grounding for it...like I know for a fact that it was Paul's fault that I dropped the conditioner all over the place, and I have no proof for it at all. And yet I just know it wasn't my fault, despite the fact that all of the logical signs point towards that. I just have a hunch, and sometimes that's what you have to go with. So, it was Paul's fault and I'm sticking by it.   OH FFS! I just closed the accounting program...OMG I can't believe it!!!!!!! AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  LMAO ok so I think I'll laugh rather than cry, because it's not worth crying over...hey look at me being all grown up...so what if i just wasted another half day, maybe it'll have saved itself anyway, like Access does, maybe this crappy database program sh!t does too....nope it doesn't, oh hurrah!  Ok I'm going to go start again...wish me luck...and i'm going to copy and paste this first because my whole being keeps messing up today  Catch u later :) xx  (just tolet you know, my browser thing stopped working then, now it's 14.53 and I just got it working again, so yay that i had the foresight to copy and paste it into word!! Bwhahahaha you wont get me that way stupid murphy's law day!!!)

      Ahhhh that's better, I love my template because I love th elickle water drop things, and of course I love Me to You lots.  I'm too tired to do a proper blog today I think, and nothing really has happened anyway. I've been thinking about kissing alot, it's like my fave thing to do in the world, when your head goes all swirly and nothing else matters, it's like your kind of doing a dance with eachother and the world could fall down around you and you'd have no idea. I love swirly headness and nothing gives that feeling quite like kissing can...i wonder if that's just me though. Because sometimes i just think that other people don't appreciate it enough. 'Tis the way of the world I guess, people don't appreciate the simple pleasures in life anymore maybe.  I just wrote a whole load about chick flicks, because I love them, but then i realised i wasn't talking about chick flicks really. I'm too tired i think.  I'm going to go because I have not much else to say now.   xx

      I get paid for being a fire warden!!!! How abso cool is that? And there I was doing it out of the goodness of my heart (and of course for the illuminous yellow armband) and yay it means more money every month too!!! Woo hoo!!!!! On top of my pay rise which came into effect this month, and my bonus Fire Warden payment, I'll be rich soon!! (i wish). Oooooooh if it doesn't work out here i could become a professional fire warden,..how much would that kick butt?!!!  And plus, yesterday my exam went really well, I think my best one so far, but we'll see. Afterwards we just sat chatting for about 2 hours and then I had to go and I totally messed things up between fnw and I, because I didn't want to have to say goodbye to him, because I don't want to not have him as a friend anymore, but I guess it's for the best. I sent him a txt when I got home and realised I'd beena bit of a cow, but he hasn't replied, which means something because usually he replies straight away, and here I am 29 hours later with still nothing, so I guess that says it all. And I also wish that I'd told him about my blogs so that he could read this and feel bad that he's made me feel like a big pile of poo, but then that would be pointless anyway. I guess some friendships just have a shelf life fromt he start and you just have to accept that, huh?  Today I got very little work done, because I was being a nice person and emailing the new boys that started the other week. One of them, well he's really nice, and we have loads in common it seems, so hopefully he'll become a friend. It got to the stage where we were writing eachother essays, which is ok for him as he doens't have a portfolio yet, but for me it's not so good. Tomorrow I so need to resist. It's just really really hard for me not to reply when people email me, esp when i like chatting to them.   On my way home I had to stop for an ambulance, which had it's siren and lights on. I hate when I see that, because it makes me think about how you can be going on with your life as normal and then something can just happen that takes everything away, or changes everything. I know that's not what it always is with ambulances, but it's what i associate with it. I've never really had that before. I mean that one moment when everything changes. Of course I've had changes, and I've had pain in my life (though not much compared to others and I'm the first to admit that the most painful times in my life so far have been of my own doing) but it's always been a gradual thing. I've never had the whole going about your business thinking everything is fine then being smacked in the face with something that just tears everything apart. I man when I found out my mum had cancer was probably the closest I got to that, and even then, it obviously didn't rip my life apart, because I knew deep down she'd get through it. The other stuff has been things I've known before I've known, so I've prepared myself, if you know what I mean. I don't think I could cope with my life being torn apart though.   Anyway, I don't have too much else to write now, lol that went of on a bit of a weird tangent, huh? I think I'm having another pj thing tonight, which will be cool, but I'm sleeping on the floor if we are. Because I've serious neck strain from the other night...this is where it'd be good to have a personal masuesse.

      LMAO at how messed up some people are. I mean there are people out there that have bypassed their sanity chip sooo greatly that even I look like a normal, functional human being next to them. I guess some people think they can do whatever they want then get back up and act like it never happened, then they look around at the people who don't get over it straight away and think it's because they are the ones with the problem...I think you're getting into true pyscho territory when it comes to that.   Yay I got petrol, though since you didn't know I needed it I guess that's no great thing at all. Yesterday my fuel light went on, for I think the first time (though probably not) on my back from work, so I got up with Paul this morning at 5.45am (that's actually a lie in for him!!) and trotted off to Tesco to get petrol. There's a surprisingly large amount of people around at that time in the morning...freaks.   AND I have my final (until my resits) exam today, which is good, but it also means that I wont get to see my college people as much now, which makes me sad. I'm going to miss them, but like I said the other day (maybe in my other blog???) that when you move on from people it's kind of not the way you expect it to be. Like you think it'll be all painful and that things wont be the same with someone in your life, but it's not like that at all when it comes down to it. I hate that about life. I mean, I'm the last person who wants to be in pain, I have a very low pain threshold, but maybe it'd be more respectful to at least feel something more than just one day realising you haven't seen the person for a while.   LMAO yesterday I was so weepy. My beloved was home when i got home and things were good, we cuddled lots, but sometimes he can be insensitive about stuff. I mean he's being funny, and if it wasn't for the bag of hormones that just freaks out on itself once a month, i'd laugh, but then he'll say things at the wrong time and it's like my mind gets laughing and crying mixed up...i swear women are messed up when it comes to the pmt thing. And I don't get the women who take offence when a man suggests that perhaps the fact she's screaming like a banchee at him because he forgot it was their 250day anniversary (or other such drivel) has something to do with PMT. I'll greatly take that explanation rather than having people think that this is how I behave normally. Why anyone would have to discount a legitimate excuse to do anything we want for a few days a month is beyond me. Perhaps PMT is simply a way to make men suffer for the fact we have to run around after them so much, and for that I guess we can't complain too much.  K i'm going to take a long bubble bath and read my notes.   Have a great day!!!! :D xx

      Howdy partners ;)  I've had such a good day. I mean it's been weird really, but good all the same. Woke up with the biggest crick in my neck ever, stoopid sleeping on the sofa. But it was so sweet, and there's something i can't say (even though there's hopefully nobody reading this now) but I'm not allowed to say it but awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww :D  Anyway, la la la today we moved onto Training Unit 2. OMG there's a new guy in training unit 1 and he so reminds me of someone I used to know, it's freaky, and i have to stop myself from acting like i've known him all my life, because that's what it feels like. We were sending emails to eachother today and i kind of kept forgetting it wasn't my old friend. Strange. Anyway, so we're in the next training unit now until we work up our portfolios, I have soooooo got the best desk, in a corner looking out on everyone so I can see everything that goes on and nobody can see me, and I'm right next to Helen and to Lisa, our new manager, which is kind of great because it means that I can just pop my head up and ask her anything, and of course it means if i'm good she'll be sure to see/hear it.  So the other day Stu and I decided that it's time for us to stop being admin. Originally I thought that Lemon would want to take it over, but when I asked her she said she felt the same, which is great really because I was worried she'd not be happy that we didn't want to do it anymore. You know I kind of thought a while ago now that i didn't want to have it anymore, but then I was so messed up in my head about who would end up with it, that i wanted to hang onto it. Now I'm so free of everything on here that I can accept that i don't particularly care how things end up with it. Of course for old time's sake I hope it continues, but it's served it's purpose for me now, and it's hardly as though i'm ever on there anymore.   I've got another exam tomorrow, my last one...well, until I resit next January. Wish me luck muchly because oh i'm not even going to pretend that wishing me luck is going to do any good at all, because tbh i'm fcuked lol.   I gotta go...need to get petrol and tampons (sorry but it's true) and do food and then revise, then tomorrow yay i'm free! I finish my exam at 11.30 then the rest of the day is all mine :D  Catch ya later ;) xx

      I feel so happy today. Which is weird because I'm all by myself tonight because Paul's away for work, which is a bit pooey. He's back tomorrow though, then away again on Wednesday night :( BUT tonight I get to just chill out, which is excellent, though of course I'm gonna end up wasting it on trashy tv...but i guess i can put it down to research...just need to find an angle for that one, but give me time, i'll find one that's convincing one of these days.   My thumb has gone to sleep. I'm pleased though because before it nodded off it was tingling like mad, too much writing. I was writing on and off (more or less constantly) for 10 hours today, I think that's some kind of record. Though my thumb is not thanking me now. I'd wake it up but then it'd be all ratty and who can be dealing with that?  I wonder what to have for dinner. Paul's having room service. I always say that potatoes are my fave food, but they're not actually, room service is. I love room service so much. I wish i could live in a hotel. Though everyone i know who lives in a hotel or has spent a long time in hotels didn't like it, I'd LOVE it! Like you don't even have to clean up at all, nor make your bed (not that i make mine now really, but you know, it'd still be better if someone else made it for me) and the little saches (NB I have tried EVERY variation of how to spell that and I have looked in the dictionary and i can't find it...it's driving me crazy so if you know how to spell it, please tell!!) of shampoo and the crappy little hairdriers that don't work properly, and everything else is just lovely, so I'd just really love to be with paul now, sitting on the bed with our tray or room service food, but nope, i'm at home wondering whether by the time i've scraped the mould off the cheese there'll be enough left for a sandwich (really need to go food shopping) and whether or not the freaky tooth fairy is going to get me tonight if i turn the light off, and i know i'm going to have to keep it on, and i wont sleep well because the light will be shining in my eyes. Luckily i can sleep in any conditions, so i'll drop off eventually, but still, i don't do well by myself, even when only for a night.  Um, next door are singing...a lot...the same few songs over and over, though they're good songs so i'll let them off. Though I am wondering why a gang of 16/17 year old boys are singing karaoke to Westlife, but who am I to judge?  Hmm I need food...

      Ok, I really need to stop drinking because every time I drink I feel like poo for 2-3 days afterwards. I'm so old lmao. Really though, it's a bit worrying that I'm past it at 24years old, I had thought when I was younger that I'd be in my prime for a bit longer than all this!   I have an exam this afternoon...i've given myself a timetable of revision for this exam, not like last time when i did no work at all (the exam went ok the other day though, think i did about the same, maybe a little worse, than last time) and I'm ahead of schedule so I thought I'd do a quick blog. I know, I know, I should just spend the extra time revising more stuff, but i think it's obvious I'm not too motivated. I'm so glad i did this a level though, because I've met some great people, and I've had a lot of fun.  Oh yay last night i copied the photos from the BBQ onto CD for thsoe that came, then i messed some of them up cos i wrote on them wrong, but hey ho i can give those ones to the people who wont care either way lol.   AND I have cramp today because I got my period this morning, which is a good thing, but i could really live without the paininess of it. You know I only started getting cramp about a year ago, along with lumpy boobs once a month, which hurt too. At least now I can join in when women around me sit complaining about how much pain they're in and how men wouldn't be able to cope with it, but us women soldier on because we're such troopers (martyrs)...I can now join in and gloat at the fact that I feel pain too...oh yay for me!  K i'm going back to my studying (I'm so studious and responsible)...catch ya later ;) xx

      So, new blog for me :D Yay! I'm not going to be too enthusiastic though, I got drunk last night and I think I'm going to die of headacheness now...soooooo not a good feeling. My poor head, I wonder how it puts up with me. Good job it has no choice I guess.  Well, not so much to say right now, because i need food and paul's said if i peel potatoes he'll cook food for me, which sounds like a good deal to me, and it means i get to nibble on the raw potatoes. I just love potatoes so much, I just can't even explain how much, but it's very much indeed.  Yay I won Trivial Pursuit again last night, thought I'd lost my touch but it seems I just have to stop my TP Nemisis from being blue and then I'm safe, so weird, i always thought blue was a kind of normal colour (though of course men in blue shirts is always a good thing) and yet it turns out blue has special powers...see how you have to watch out for things that seem simple?  AND I actually won a game of bowling the other day...HOORAH a million times!!! I got 119! I was sooo happy :D Right...I'm gonna go peel potatoes :D Catch ya later ;) xx

      I just did a quiz on the Love Actually website and it turns out....  "No matter where the rainbow goes, you'll be chasing it, with flowers, candy, and a song in your heart"  LOL...Maybe that gives me hope that I'm not turning into a cynical old woman after all...perhaps you can't change who you are...and perhaps that's a really, really, really, good thing.  Try it out...  urlLink http://www.loveactually.com/  then go to features. (let me know what you come up with if you try it) xx

      Silly postman just woke me up...though if I'm honest it's a good thing because I'm sleeping later and later recently, which is fine, but then as soon as it gets to 4pm my mind seems to shut off. And it's my late night tonight...5pm!! I know I shouldn't complain, but it is really hard to stay until 5pm when everyone leaves at 4pm, especially on a Friday. Oh well, at least it means I was able to take next Friday afternoon off for the BB final!!!  Today is the day I asked people to get back to me about our Section night out, and hardly anyone has yet so I'm going to have to chase people today...so inconsiderate...i don't understand why people leave things like that to the last minute. Oh, ok, I do, because I'm like the biggest procrastinater ever, but when it's things that I want people to do, I want them to do it immediately. Must be the princess in me...make no bones about it, I know my demandingness is there, and I actually have come to the conclusion that it's a good thing...I can be a pretty good friend when I want to be. I guess I forget that sometimes, because I don't put up with crap from people a lot of the time. I mistake choosing my friends carefully with being a cow. Thing is, I'll be the best friend in the world until I realise I'm not getting anything back. Though of course that's not true of everyone, there are a few people in my life who I seem to have such a soft spot for I'd take anything from them, which is sad and pathetic, but some ties are just far too hard to break in your head.   Anyway, the person who just read this, who will inevitably be thinking "was that aimed at me?", as they so often do, I hear...it's not aimed at them, or anyone, it's just the way I am.   I don't have much to report. Things are a bit weird, not necessarily in a bad way. I'm thinking it's strange how some people crave what I have so much that they'll read it into every relationship they have, while the people who have it seem intent not to cherish it. Maybe it's the wanting what you haven't got thing.&nbsp;   A friend said to me last night that if I was given a straighforward, boring path, that would get me there in 10mins, OR&nbsp;a long, tricky, winding road that would take forever but would be pretty and interesting, I'd take the long road. (not exact words, but you get the drift of it) That made me think, because someone once said the same thing to me, but when they said it I saw it as&nbsp;a negative comment. Last night I kind of saw it as a positive thing. Say we only get one life...why waste it going from A to B? Isn't it the moments of real emotion that make life so interesting? Even the pain and crap, it's all part of life and so we should kind of embrace it maybe.   I love Avril Lavigne, and one of her songs, Anything but Ordinary, is so how I feel a lot of the time, in fact probably all of the time.   So my sister bought a guinea pig yesterday...I'm not 100% sure how good that is for the poor fellow, her last one she poisoned with chocolate, and she's been known to boil her goldfish in the past...ah well, I hope it ends well for this one...  AND yay my parent's are coming to visit next weekend, which I only found out yesterday, and I'm really happy about it, because it feels like forever since I saw them. Gosh it's&nbsp;a lot harder than I thought it would be to be so far away from my family. I mean day to day it's fine and I obviously don't think about it. But sometimes, even when there'snothing wrong, I just want a hug from my mum and dad, and I have to maek do with a phone call instead. Though at least I have that, I cant' imagine how horrible it would be to not be able to just call my parents when I just wanted a chat, or needed advice...whether it be because we were estranged, or because one of them was no longer here...either way it'd break my heart.   I'd better go...sorry for the deepities of the blog. xx

      I've found it amazingly hard to concentrate, my mind has been buzzing with a zillion thoughts today. All good ones.&nbsp;But when you've got buzzyness in your head it&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;very hard to cope with when at work...on a training course, on the intricacies on CRU...I swear I'm going to keep my manual and read it to my children when they can't sleep.   Anyway, last night I was down and lonely. But it ended up as quite a good night. I have no idea what time I went to bed, probably about 2am, though may not have been. And&nbsp; I really needed to have gone to bed before that, but just didn't happen...but you don't need to hear me go on about all that.   OK so my brain is frazzled today, but I was happy because Andy let me hold his elastic band ball for a while to make up for scratching me yesterday...it made such a world of difference. I'm just happy in work tbh, still. And I know I'm boring people with it, who would have thought that I would actually find somewhere that fit when it came to work?  I have to go now...total early night for me I think...this time I mean it!   Love yas. xx

      YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!! I got tickets for the final BB next week!!!! I am soooo hyper! Though you can only have a group of 4, which is a bit of a bummer, but they let me get tickets for one of my friends too so we have 8 between us, which is cool! HUUUUURRRRAHHHH!!! I am sooooo excited!!!  Though I'm a bit doubtful about how many people actually apply for the tickets since I've had them every week I've applied apart from one...me thinks they like to make themselves sound more popular than they are tbh.   My forehead has broken out in a thousand spots, which is so horrible that I wouldn't be surprised if people thought I was a pizza delivery girl. Which I'm not.   Obviously.   AND we had training this afternoon and Emma, Andy and I were seeing how many times we could fold paper (though at first Andy thought we were just folding paper for the fun of it!!...like we'd ever be  that  sad.) And he said he'd done 8 (which is just not possible, you can not at all defy physics like that). He wouldn't show me it though (because he didn't want his lie exposed) =, but then he dropped it on the floor so I picked it up and he went to grab it back, and scratched me!! Not on purpose (I am giving him the benefit of the doubt on that one) but it really hurt and it bled like mad. I'm considering sueing but I don't want any bad feelings to hinder my career so I'll have to give it serious thought before I issue.   I'm having jelly tonight!! I made 3 bowls of it last night! How cool is that? Weird though, how when we're little we hate the confines of having to eat 3 square meals a day...how come a square meal is good for you?...when you'd think that TV dinners can't be  that  good...and wish we could eat junk all day, then when we grow up we stick to broadly the same lines. I remember when I first moved into halls thinking 'OMG i ccan eat what I want when I want' and yet thismorning I went to have some jelly and then I thought 'no, not for breakfast'. Why Goddamnit??!! Why can't we just be free??!!!!  Oh no I just had a funny phone call. Well, the phone rang then whoever it was stayed on for about 30seconds, with me helloing like an idiot. Then they hung up. They witheld their number. I hate when that happens. Once or twice I can cope with, but after that I freak out, even when I'm with someone to be honest. Because I'm no fool...if a thief is casing the joint (yep despite my WASPy appearance I know black ganster talk just as well as the best of them...don't be fooled sucka) to see who's at home and then breaks in later with a gun, why in the world would any of the men I know be able to save me?..samuri sword or not.   Although I do do (lol @ do do) the quilt thing. And I also believe that if I close my eyes while the lights are being turned out then the monsters/ghosts/dead people (or insert&nbsp;your scarey being of choice) can not come out and will not get me...I challande you to try it...i've been doing it for years and it's worked for me so far...knock on wood.   The other thing I worry about is that maybe it was a suspicious wife calling her husband to check up on him...unfortunately she dialled the wrong number and called here instead...and is now freaking out because a woman answered the phone and her husband is supposed to be by himself, but instead he's with some skany ho. I really wouldn't want to be an integral part to a marriage breakup like that.   LMAO P just said he had a Maccy D's for lunch, I asked what he had and he said a Big Mac. After coaxing the full story for him I discovered that he actually had a Big Mac, 2 fries, a cheeseburger and a MsFlurry (and a coke). It utterly amazes me...and I'm no light eater!  I think that's me done now. Oh, apart from the Crusher brought in doughnuts today, just to be nice, and although he's not in my dept (he's in the one next to me as I'm on Unit 2 and he's on unit 1) he gave me one, which I thought was really sweet. Then Dan showed me like the biggest elastic band ball EVER...it really put my one to shame. I'm going to give him some elastic bands tomorrow I think, because I'm nice like that.   Have a great evening. xx  &nbsp;

      So basically I got through today remarkably well. At most points I even forgot about the hangoverness and just stuck into my work....to the level that when I handed in my work sheet as I was leaving my supervisor commented that I'd been a busy bee. I thought I'd leave out the fact that I had had no choice but to knuckle down today because doing anything apart from sitting at my desk made me feel like I was going to keel over, and working at least took my mind off it., so instead I just smiled like a ray of sunshine at the compliment and breezed out. God knows how I got home in one peice, my legs are jelly.   I, of course, emailed a bit...though was only emailing one person today. I think I'll call him Crusher for the purposes of my blog.&nbsp; Anyway he and I have the foundations for quite a good friendship I think. He's going onto the section that Dia is on though, which is a shame, but hopefully we'll still be able to get to know eachother a bit better. But that's not for another 6 weeks anyway. And I already have orders on what to get him for Christmas, the cheek of it. I think the chances of me traipsing around MK trying to find a nude page 3 girl advent calendar in return for 2 of the chocolates on any days I choose (that nearly swayed me I must admit) are slim to none.   Ok, so extreme hangover insightfulness follows - but I'm leaving it in because (as long as I can trust the 4/5 people who have the address to this blog) only people I don't mind hearing this stuff will read it anyway.   A lifetime ago I fell in love with someone so deeply that I thought I had found the reason I was here, it was so most definitely meant to be more than anything else in the world. Of course, part of me doesn't believe that one person can be your whole, but I knew back then that he was.&nbsp;And he was, and will always be, the most perfect person I have ever known. His flaws are glaryingly obvious and yet despite them, he's just amazing to me. I saw my future with him and I knew he was The One.   Then I suppose, I saw the truth...that you can either have it all, or you can chase the dream, and when it's all in front of you, you'd be a fool to continue looking for something that doesn't even exist.  So, The One...not P, as it happens. But you'd already worked that one out, huh? The One was nothing more than a dream when it came down to it.&nbsp;Often when you analyse things after the fact, you see that it wasn't how you thought it was at all, right?&nbsp;Obviously the romantic in me wishes that one day...(especially when P and I are going through a tough patch LOL ;-)) well, that one day...oh you all know how that ends I'm sure.  So, anyhoo, I could sit here and focus on the deepness of the feelings I have for P. But I know I dont need to. And I know that it's hard to believe this, because of the way I behave sometimes, but I don't think I could put into words the way I feel about him, because I'm scared it would cheapen it.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's more real than I even thought possible. The lust thing, the "squidginess" (first time I've used that world in a long time) of love, it pales in comparison. And believe me, I never thought I'd be saying that. Of course you have to have that too, but there's something deeper that matters a whole lot more, and I never realised that before.   Do you want to know a secret? I've always had like a fantasy (not sexual, thank you) that on my wedding day, The One would storm in and rescue me from making the biggest mistake of my life...  1) how many fairytale's must I have foolishly believed in when I was a child? 2) how cruel does it make me to&nbsp;have actually dreamt of ripping my groom's heart out like that? 3) does the fact that Alfie Moon did it mean that it might actually happen to me? 4) would I really want to be with someone who would ruin my one perfect day like that? 5) I think in reality it'd be rather embarrassing  So, in the last month or so I've kind of shifted in how I see the big L (i mean Love for any thick Americans out there). And you know what scares the hÂ£ll out of me about all of this is that I think it means I've grown up a tad.  But that's just my hangover talking.

      Basically the title sums up how I'm feeling today. Though my head actually feels a bit numb, which often happens before the hangover really lets rip and tears my brain apart for the day. Something tells me that a zillion cans of lager, almost half a bottle of vodka and 2 hours sleep are not the best ingredients for a productive day at work. And yet I'll go in, smile and be chirpy, and just pray that nobody notices the dead bird in my&nbsp;mouth or fact that some tiny creature is playing bounce with my eyeballs.   Hmmm that's interesting, I just changed the template on my blog...it just came over me and now in a couple of days I'm going to want my old one back and not be able to find the template! Poo.  Oh Dia called me yesterday, she's going to put in her notice today! I'm a bit surprised, but think that it's probably the best thing for her. If she ends up going. Part of me thinks she's going to try to use it as a way to get more days unpaid leave, a dangerous game to play perhaps. I dunno, I am not the brightest this moring.   I'm really struggling to eat a bowl of crunchy nut cornflakes, because I had no dinner last night and thought I had better eat something. Just thought I'd let you know.   So, last night...was a good one, though perhaps mid week is not the best time. FNW turned up at about 11ish I think, which was weird, but kind of sweet. He joined in TP and was crap...LOL. I laugh at people's crapness, because I'm not too nice when it comes to TP. It's weird to me how you can think you know stuff about&nbsp; a person then they do something and it makes you wnder really. Men confuse me. I mean they're easy to see really, but when you try to work them out they have a great way of confusing the hÂ£ll out of you. I mean not that it matters, I'm just saying.   I'm going to go nurse the toilet for a while...have a great day. xx #

      So I've hopefully stuck with my normal colour because no offence to the colourfulness of my previous blog but it&nbsp;didnt go with the format I think.   I was sooooo devastated today. I was in a meeting for the Sports and Social Club Committee and the fire alarm went off!!!!! I've been waiting for there to be a fire and/or drill for so long now and then when we have one I'm on the opposite side of the building so didn't even get to put on my illuminous yellow arm band and boss people about!!! You have no idea how gutted I was...and now I'm going to have to pay someone to start a fire so that I can prove my Fire Warden skills!!! TSK! (sooo joking there)  I've been asked to welcome another person into the company on Monday so I'm totally looking forward to that. I'm the nice and responsible one I think...I like that :D  AND it's pay day today. Unfortunately most of my money is already gone, but I do have enough left to have some fun at least. AND I've got lots of stuff with the SSC coming up...I'm organising a meal out in September so that should be totally cool! Oh I wonder if it's going to be a problem that I'm away the first week in September...I hope not. I'll have to work around that.   A&nbsp;friend sent me an email last week and I can't find it and I don't know their email address so I can't send them one to let them know. So all I can do is wait to see if they send me another one, which I hope they will do!  Other stuff's happened but all good stuff and I can't be bothered to write everything...the general theme is that it's sunny and lovely and oooooh I have my hair curly today. It was casual day for Willen Hospice so I thought I'd wear my hair more casual too. Not that curly hair is casual, but it looks more casual on me. And a little romanitc actually. Though that's probably just in my head.   I really want to get drunk tonight. Wonder if I should, but think it'd be best to do it tomorrow night because yesterday I had pmt and took it out on Paul so tonight I have to try my nicest to be nice to him!  AND it's so weird with people. Sometimes&nbsp;someone will&nbsp;have a go at you whilst trying to be all innocent and you know that they were having a go at you, but you can't really say&nbsp;anything about it&nbsp;because it was so subtle that perhaps they weren't. But, those that need to make snide remarks about other people, well...perhaps those people need to look at what's going on in their own&nbsp;life and at how happy they really are deep inside. Because (and of course I may be wrong) those that are trully happy and content in life need neither to convince the world of it, nor to make other people doubt themselves.   So anyway...Jason will be out tonight, though at the mo I am not liking Dan so want him to be out...I want Victor to win right now, which is weird, because I'm not even sure that I like him, but he makes me laugh, and he's got personality, and he wants it badly.&nbsp; And the others all just annoy me or have no impact on me at all. I was supposed to be going to the eviction tonight but then I decided not to go, and so I have tickets here that are not going to be used. I'm still thinking 'is it too late to go' but I don't particularly want to see J leave, he's just boring, but if it's one of the others that I like I'll be gutted. And I wore really pretty clicky shoes today and now I have big red marks on my feet from them...they hurt lots, but I did look very pretty.   AND the new boys who I email (not just me emailing them...they do email me back) have a pool comp and one of the boys from scanning made them a trophy so I've been winding K up this afternoon because he hasn't won it yet and B and A have, D hasn't either but he was on a half day today. And so next Friday us girlies are going to watch them play, which is soooo cool because I absolutely adore watching people play pool!!!  ON my way home today they were playing Mr Wendel (sp) on the radio and it reminded me sooo much of when I was all happy and young (er) and free and things were really simple (admit it, no matter how easy are lives are now, things are still soooo much more complicated than they were when we were younger) AND I was in a pub with my friends from school one night and there was a jukebox and my best friend at the time and me put Mr Wendel on sooo many times, there was&nbsp;4 of us who hung around together and the others hated it, but K and I were just dancing around the place and being silly. Things were so much fun back then, and we were so tight as friends. But then, inevitably when people sleep around and act the fool, one of us got pregnant and took it to heart too much, and after that I guess&nbsp;life just became a little more serious. But hey, we had so much fun while we were together. It's a shame when friendships become messed up for no good reason, huh? Anyway, the song made me smile lots and I turned it up really high (or at least as high as my pradio allows, I get that that is barely a whisper compared to some people's stereos) and sung along.   Ok that's it from me...I'm going to go pick up my beloved from the train station (grrrr my poor feet!!) and then spend the evening chilling out and t over being sad that I miss work because I'm a freak and I love my job! LOL!  Oh poo Paul just called to say he wont be home until 7pm tonight. Oh well, I'm going to go tidy the house a bit and make myself look prettier for him! xx

        Ooooooh I like this! Well done to the blogger people who are continually adding more features and making it all lovely for us!       &nbsp;   Once again, sorry for not blogging for a few days! Trying to think what's happened...of course there was Alton Towers...an excellent day as usual. I had soooo much fun. It rained for about 15mins, luckily when we were having lunch, then it was quite sunny...all of the rides were cool. Though I didn't go on Obvlivion this time...once was enough for me (I have the photo to prove I've been on and that's good enough for me!) We went on everything else though, and major fun was had by all.&nbsp; I was soooo knackered on Sunday though, my trapezius muscles and cervical spine were very much damaged ;0) LOL. Seriously though, they were. Also, I screamed so much on the rides (not out of fear, but for fun...you just have to scream on the rides...even on Runaway Mine Train!!) that my voice went all husky and I love that...unfortunately now it is 95% better and only creeks every now and then :( Mmmm to have a sexy husky voice....       &nbsp;   I got the photos for 5 of the rides we went on...they are hilarious. Sorry to H for sharing this, but she looked like she was about to crap herself on Nemises and Spinball Whizzer....OMG on Spinball Whizzer she was shouting 'PLEASE LET THIS BE IT PLEASE LET THAT BE IT!' I couldn't stop laughing (between screams of course)&nbsp; And on Air, she was scared to go on...but it's my fave ride, I love the soariness and how free you feel...in fact it's the only rides I don't hold onto...i love my arms just flying around.&nbsp; And so I told her it's not fast or scarey (because I don't think it it) adn as we were going round she was shouting 'YOU LIIIIEEEEDDDDD!!! Soooo funny!       &nbsp;   Also, I met my sister's new boyf...he seems so nice. Sarah's had shit from men in the past so it's good to see that she's found someone who cares for her so. She's always been drawn towards people who have been such hardwork in the past, something I never could understand, but it seems now she's with someone who she can just be with, and just have fun with. That's a great thing for her and I hope very much that it works out and they're very happy together.        &nbsp;   (I'll post some piccies soon on my website, and for the BBQ...when I get round to it!!)        &nbsp;   Such a cloud has lifted. LOL This morning while I was pouring cereal into my new lilac and pink breakfast bowl and making a cup of tea in my matching cup this morning, I realised that I'm back...long gone are the blues that were making me so insane and I know why, and it's good. Also...note the breakfastness of my morning...I'm sooo responsible. You know I could even feel my metabolism kicking in thsi morning.       &nbsp;   So major problem being I haven't lost any weight for ages and I'm going on holiday in about 6 weeks  (figures correct at time of printing, Karen can take no responsibility for any losses incurred as a result of relying on this information)   So not quite sure what I'm going to do...perhaps my dreams of walking down the street and seeing people look at my gorgeousness should just be forgotten. Because I'm actually ok as I am, I just think that...and I know this sounds big headed...that I'd be quite lovely if I was thinner, rather than being so average as I am now. I guess I just want Paul to have the best maybe.         &nbsp;   Work was excellent today, we had training on a system we use to value PI claims, and I was al brainy and professional. Tomorrow and Thursday we're training on the anatomy (tomorrow) and the use of medical experts (Thursday) with my favourite external trainer, Adam, who is sooo like someone I used to know that I just love him :D I mean not literally, he's married with kids...major turn off...but he's so adorable and round. I love round people, they've got such great personalities ( I wonder if that's been scientifically proven ever)        &nbsp;   Ah well, just a semi quick one from me, I need to go pick up Paul, he's in London this week. Next week he's in Dundee, which means he's away...but it'll give me lots of time to study for the CII, which will be useful.       &nbsp;   Catch ya later ;-) xx

      Ok firstly total apologies for the lack of blogginess. I've been kind of busy this week. I pormised myself that even though I'm hardly on&nbsp;the internet&nbsp;now I would keep up to date with my blogs, because it's like my diary to me, so I'll start to make an effort again.  &nbsp; This week has been really busy. My social life is on a total up at the mo so that's good, of course. I went to see Mean Girls at the cinema the other day with a really good friend from work, which is kind of good, actually I can't make my mind up about it, but it wasn't bad and it had a few funny bits in it. And I had salty popcorn with loads of butter on it...YUM YUM!!!! I ate it so quickly though that I made myself feel sick!!! &nbsp; Also, I went bowling the other night too and one of the games I got 169!!!!! That's like a totally excellent score!!!!!! So very well done to me! (on the other game I got 60, not so good, but it was because one of the girls there had never been before and she did kind of pooey in the first game, so on the second I thought I'd play down and throw a few gutter balls for her, then she started to do rather well so I thought 'screw that' and tried my hardest and I still did crap!!) &nbsp; Tomorrow we're going to Alton Towers. Which is going to be great because my sister has got us fast track passes so we don't have to queue for any of the rides. Afterwards we're going back to her new house for a drink, she's invited some of her girl friends round, so it'll be good to meet them. Also, her boyf will be spending the day with us so that's cool because I haven't met him yet and they're quite serious, he treats her like the princess we all deserve to be, so I am excited about that! &nbsp; ALSO, I'm now a member of the Sports and Social Club Committee where I work, which is excellent because it's taken really seriously and is a great chance for me to prove my organisational skills, I have my first committee meeting next Friday (though I hope it finishes on time because I am going to the BB eviction next Friday and so need to leave work dead on 4pm) so I need to totally prepare and have lots of great ideas. I'm going to organise an End of Summer 70's night if I can...but obviously I have no idea how it all works yet with finance etc so will have to see.  &nbsp; At the mo I'm organising a section night out for the training units, though not sure when it is going to be yet because people are on holiday. We're going to go bowling then for a meal, so that should be fun and will be a fab chance for us all to get to know eachother a bit better.  &nbsp; We've been on quite a few training courses lately, which is always good because it backs up the stuff we've learnt so far and so I've been learning so much, next week I'm on a couple more, thoguh it does mean that I feel like I'm behind on work...lol...I have&nbsp;a 2 week backlog, most people have months!! This is just the most ideal job ever, I love working where I work and still, sometimes I'll look around and just wonder why they wanted me, and yet more and more I see that I belong there.  &nbsp; Past couple of weeks have been so hard for me. I mean in my head things have been a bit of a rollercoaster. But Paul was away Monday and Tuesday night this week (he came on on Wednesday as a surprise because he finished his work early...how lovely is that?) and I spent the time alone trying to work out what was wrong with me. I finally worked it out, and saw what I've been carrying with me, how I've been reluctant to let some things go that I really needed to let go.  &nbsp; It's important to look within you sometimes and see that no matter how wonderful things seem on the outside, we all have these little niggles in our head, even if we don't want those on the outside to see it, and I'm not a fool, I know that nothing's ever actually perfect. I mean bits of your life can be, but there's always something to work on. But I think facing up to the things you have to work on is such an excellent step in the right direction.  &nbsp; Right, I'd better go now, otheriwise I'll have to stay past 4pm tonight!!! And that would never do!!!! &nbsp; Catch you later ;-) xx

      I'm all happy now. I love the new maestro advert with the penguins getting married. So adorably cute.   I see you baby shakin' that ass...one of my fave ever adverts!!!!! HUURAHH!!!!  LOL i swear I'm totally insane for the past couple of weeks, I'm just like on a total rollercoaster, sometimes I'm so low I can't see a way out and think everything is just so bad that I can't even breathe or hear anything apart from the crappiness in my head, then all off a sudden the cloud lifts and I'm unbelievably happy so that I can't even think of anything bad in my life and everything just seems so sunny and bright. Thing is there seems to be no pattern to it, it just swings on and off. So now I'm on abit of a high, unlike this morning when I was low again...but let's hope this high lasts for quite a while, because I think it's obvious that anyone would prefer to be happy.  It's raining quite a lot today. Now I know some people would prefer it to be sunny, but I love the rain when it's like this. It's still quite warm outside and the raindrop are really large. It always smells so nice after it's rained like this too.   We just had pizza...well, I had chicken dunkers and potato wedges because I'm not so keen on pizza these days. It was yummy but I'm so full now. REALLY need to loose weight. I know I keep saying that. but I do need to, I just can't find the motivation. Maybe I should fall in love with someone who wont want me unless I'm thin and gorgeous, that would motivate me. Though it would make my life a lot more complicated too, so perhaps I should try to stay away from falling in love with another right now.   Also, I am sooooooo loving how cool Big Brother is this series, they've had some excellent ideas, and the Catch 22 style Boot Camp they've got this weekend is just fab! I hope that they pass the task so that the privates are up for nomination, that way we may get rid of the horrible, horrible Ahmed (don't forget the phlegm when you're saying that) out of there. Then it will be totally bearable. Really, with him, Kitten and Marco (aka the 3 most annoying, hate-able people in all of the world) it's amazing someone hasn't blown the house up. Ah well, hopefully after this week we'll have rid of the last of them.   Am going to watch Catch me if you can now. I saw it in the cinema and wasn't impressed when I watched it, but since I've kind of started to think it was a good film. Maybe it's the idea and story behind the film was good, but they just didn't do it well. It's a true story aswell you know. I saw an interview with the man it's based on once and he said there's nothing in the film that he didn't actually do. I know that's not necessarily true just because he said it, but still, even though I'm so not into people breaking the law, it's totally impressive.

      Helloooo there! Today I'm cleaning the house from top to toe...and tomorrow too since there's so much dirt and crap that it's going to take me two days. I've even cleaned out the little draw that you put conditioner into on my washing machine, so when I say from top to toe I really mean it. Sometimes cleaning is so good for you and gives you time to think about the things that have been obscured by day to day happenings.   I just spent about an hour writing lots of stuff down and in a whim I decided to delete it. Now I'm thinking that was a stupid thing to do but I just can't be bothered to write it all again.   It's sunny outside but really chilly. I wish it was warm today because I really feel like going outside to just sit and be for a while. Though I'm going to start studying for the CII today, which is going to be hard work but worth it I think. Please please please kick my bottie if I start to get complacent with it. I'm so annoyed with myself for always not doing the work then doing well but knowing I could have done better.   I can't wait for Vickster and Stu to get back from their hols, I miss reading their blogs too much. The last few nights I've come online then checked out a couple of the websites I like and then had nothing else to do!!! Esp when handbag.com hadn't been updated, I am practically coming on, checking emails then just shutting the computer striaght down...how unlike that is me? Seems I'm really far away from where I was this time last year (when I was a little insane with the onlineness)   Right, off to finish cleaning downstairs, I'll do upstairs tomorrow I think. Anyway Paul's alseep upstairs so I can hardly go bouncing around with my Mr Muscle, can i?

      I've had a really great cpuple of days. Yesterday I was in London again. It was cool, but we didnt go shopping or anything, but still I get so excited when I'm in London, even though there's the dreaded escalators to overcome. And the escalators in London aren't as scarey as normal ones...though I did see signs that said that last year there were 1588 injuries on escalators on the underground alone...and get this...ONE FATALITY!!! I feel vindicated, though bad for the person who died, but still...I knew they were evil and dangerous!!  Today in work I got so much work done, it made me feel really good. I love when I get lots of work done because I feel more like I'm actually making a difference. I've started to feel like I'm kind of just waiting to move on at the mo, and I'm scared that perhaps I'm just meant to be a claims handler and there wont be the chance for me to move on up, because it really depends on how my supervisors see me as I move from dept to dept, and I'm not so sure that my new manager is as impressed with me as my old one was, which is making me feel crappy at work. I mean I still love it, very much so, I feel kind of alive when I'm doing my job, but long term I just wonder.  This evening we went to see Shrek 2. Well, we saw the 5.45pm showing. It is such an excellent film. So funny and romantic and just a reallt fab film. In fact I thought it was better and funnier than the first one, which is rare in films.   I just blogged a lot about how I've been the last week or so and yet I came to a conclusion that like in the olden days people used to keep things to themselves all of the time. I know all the crap about better out than in, but if nothing's going to change no matter what you do, what's the point in even bringing it up?  Oh poo I've been so happy the last few days. Time to brighten up again I think.   xx

      Hmm let me think...when did i last blog? Sunday? Yup I think so. Ok, so yesterday I was in London on a training thingy. The actual training was on witness interviewing and was a bit boring, the course was kind of made for police/lawyers who interview face to face, whereas we do all of our interviewing on the phone, so not entirely useful. Though the lunch was yummy, and the people there were really nice. Afterwards Paul met us at the hotel and the 3 of us went shopping. I got some new clothes (cleared my wardrobe on Sunday and ended up with lots of empty space as loads of my stuff was too big for me) and I got this amazingly cute pair of shoes, they're black but see through with a white bow across with little bauble things on the end, they sound not as nice but they are, they're lovely.   Turns out my blues were down to the fact that I hadn't bought new shoes for a long long time lol.   So spent time walking around Oxford Street then went for dinner. We went to this lovely little Italian restaurant, I had mussels to start, they were sooooo amazing, with tomato and chilli sauce, they were just amazing. It was a really nice atmosphere, and the food was gorgeous, and the waiter was a bit dosgy but in a funny way. And yay it was Helen and I's first dinner out so that was cool.  Oh, Paul's not away this week, he's travelling, which is good because I'm kind of not in the right place to be alone to do what I want right now maybe.  I have to go get dinner...we're having Chinese tonight...yay!!!! I'll write more soon because I think i have a lot more to say.   xx

      Last night when we got back I sat down to write a blog, started it, then lost interest and couldn't be bothered so now I forgot everything that I was going to write...tut tut, sorry.  I feel a bit chirpier today, though I have to try to do the accounts today again, and this weekend I really do need to get them done because it's dragged on too long and I have been issued with a warning that if they're not done by the 17th I'm not allowed to go to Alton Towers...and that'd sooooo piss me off a million. So, I'm going to be a big brave girl and just do them, and I'm going to concentrate and please please please don't make me do it wrong because I'll cry...again...lol.  The cricket was good i think. We got to chat to a few people that we hadn't chatted to before so that was good. I wasn't exactly the happiest though so I guess I didn't use the chance to my advantage, it takes so much energy at the moment for me to be chipry in work. Which I have to do, because no matter how pooey you're feeling, when you're in work you have to be at your best because nobody wants to know if you're having a hard time, all they care about (and rightly) is that you're doing your job right with an excellent attitude...and that's my main selling point, my attitude in work, so I can't let that go.   When I got home after the cricket I went shopping with Stu, which cheered me up and Stu got this really cool hat that just makes him look totally cool. When we got back I went round to his and "helped" him pack...the helping part was me watching as he tried on all of his clothes...of course he looked gorgeous in everything he tried on. ;)  So yesterday work was ok, I got quite a lot done because the new peeps were on training again, which is good, even though not as fun, because I do tend to get less work done when they're in work. I so need to cut that out. Part of me is very aware that it's going to help me long term though. I mean even though I'd be nice to the newbies anyway, because it's the type of person I am, I guess I'm being extra nice and making it so that they definitely come to me if they want to know anything, because it's good for me to have that chance to prove that I can give guidance and support to people etc; it's always good to be noticed for that, not to mention that you can never have too many people on your side when you're on your way up.   Last night I went to the BB eviction again with Helen and one of her friends. Have to say it was my fave one so far, the atmosphere was soooo amazing, we were in the middle of the crowd for the first time, which is actually so much much better than being at the front, because the whole of the good feeling vibe is all around you. It was just really cool. AND HURRRRRRUUUUUUUUAHAAAHHHHHUUURRRAAAAHHHHHURRRRAAHHHHHHUUUUUUUURRRRRAAAAAHHHHHH!!!I was so happy that Marco was evicted, though I'm a bit worried about my phone bill now, because I voted quite a few times. Though I don't usually vote apart from in the final, and I can't imagine wanting to vote again, I just really wanted him out and I was thinking that not many people would be voting so it would be worth it, which it was. Anyone else I want out it's kind of a given that they'd be out as soon as they were up anyway.   Helen drove, thank God, because I was feeling really rough all yesterday, like I had a massive hangover and I still feel it a bit now. Think maybe it's the poisonous bluesome feeling maifesting itself physically, or maybe I've been feeling ill the last week and that's why everything has been such an effort for me. I hope so. In my head I actually feel a bit brighter today. Surprising what a bit of pity niceness can do your you, huh?  Also got a really nice email yesterday, which lifted me so much that I can't even tell you. Funny how you can poo all over someone a million times and they'll still be there for you.   Yesterday on our way home I was looking at the map (because we had to divert) and Helen has this little torch and I put it on my finger and it shone right through and you could see alll my veins and everything, it was pretty minging but kind of cool anyway.

      So basically I'm just driving myself insane lately with the knowledge that nobody wants me, nobody needs me. People like me and some even seem captivated by me, for the first little while that I know them, then they realise who I really am and that I'm not half of what I seem to be, and then that's it, they just tolerate me and I can see it in people's eyes, can tell from the tone of everything and it just makes me insane. That's all.   I just want to have somebody who actually wants me for me, who feels passion for me. And yet history shows that when I have that I just let it go or I spoil it. And I have smelly breath because I ate garlic liek a week ago and it means nobody will ever want me ever again.   So there.   I'm going to the annual company cricket match in a little while and it's pouring with rain...so that'll be fun. Still, I had fun at the cinema last night, because the cinema is just great. So yay I can still have fun despite being all crappy sorry for myself. God I hate people like me.

      You have  got  to be kidding me!!! No way in this world can it have been raining all day and still be this hot and close!! So i fell asleep on the sofa tonight whilst watching TV and then when I woke up I went to bed, and I couldn't sleep at all, partly because it's too early but mostly because it's just too hot. I mean it, I can't stand it anymore!!! Please please please just let up a little bit, heat making person in the sky, because I'm sure all of the Sun worshippers love it, but I don't, it's icky and makes me dizzy and I really look bad when I'm hot and sweaty. And I think my brain has actually fried a little. Say my 1% of my brain is frazzled with the heat every year, and we only use 10% of our brains...what if the bits of my brain that are burnt beyond repair are the bits that I use? That'd be really bad and I'd end up a cross between Bush and Jade...and that'd just be bad all round. Though if you think about it, he's like one of the most powerful men in the world, and she's like mega rich now...so maybe I'd be better off if I was a bit thicker.  My dad was making me laugh this weekend because he taught me "das ist nicht moglich" which means 'that's not possible'. And it's just soooo funny because if you say it really fast it sounds like you're talking backwards...how cool is that? (probably not so, but I think it is, very very cool)  Yay one of my friends has just come online for a natter, which is most excellent because I've been missing them!  Hmmmm now i have nothing else to write about, apart from the fact that no BB...boo hoo so much. Today was excellent talking about it so much, but now it's kind of like I just have to let it go, man. And I need to find myself a new ringtone because I have the BB theme tune and pretty soon it's going to sound pretty pathetic...believe me, it's way cool while BB is on...I swear.  I did some studying tonight...it's so interesting but is taking me ages to get through it all. Thing is I thought I'd have loads of time to get through it all but it turns out that I haven't changed after all and I'm still bad at the actual sitting down and just concentrating for a couple of hours, and so I'm only doing half an hour a day, which is probably a lot more productive anyway, but I just like to get things out of the way and stuff.  This week I think I have quite a lot on, well not a lot, but enough to keep me busy. Tomorrow night I'm going to the pictures to see I, Robot. I'm not actually looking forward to the film because I don't think it looks too good...but no doubt Will Smith will more than make up for it, and popcorn!!!!! *drools* Then on Wednesday in work I have a training session on negotiation skills, which I'm looking forward to because it's actually something I probably need to work on, but we have to call our Section leader and do like a role play and I just can't do things like that. I feel like the biggest pleb in the world role playing and it's just all pooey, so that bit I am not looking forward to. Hopefully I can just go first and get it out of the way!  Then either Wednesday or Thursday night I'm going out with my friends from college, which should be great because I haven't seen them for a couple of weeks and I really want to keep in touch with them.  Thursday and Friday in work I have training again, the final 2 days of the training I had last week finishing everything up. Should be good I hope.  You know what, I am soooo pleased for air conditioned offices!! I wish we had air conditioning. Next year we'll look at buying a systemy thing, so hoefully we won't have to suffer so badly next year. Sorry to keep going on but I am really serious about the heat thing. It's like the worst thing about seasons.  So today a friend from work who I haven't actually talked about much, she started about 5weeks ago and is really mad and totally lovely...like a big ball of energy...anyway, she told me this BIG secret that totally shocked me...I was standing 'Oh My God'ing for ages! It'll make no difference to you anyway because you don't know the people, but she's getting to know soemoen else from work a bit better, and it's totally sweet but I have to admit it knocked me for six (what does that mean? Did I even say it right?) Anyway, I love when people tell me their secrets. I think it's a massive compliment.  I think I'm going to have to go now, I'm majorly hot and think it's cooler upstairs maybe. Also I'm sure I'm being bitten down here by little midgies or something...not sure though...hope no...will have to get those exterminator people out who get rid of all the bugs or whatever and that stuff can kill you, you know.  Anyway I had a really really productive day today, I was annoyed with myself on Friday because I didn't hit the target I set myself, but this morning I caught up with myself and am now way ahead of what I had planned to get done this week, so that's great.  Okay now I am going....have a great day tomorrow (today depending on when you're reading) xx

      OMFG You have to go to handbag.com and look at the Bush quotes (in the entertainment section but there's a link to them on the front page as I type this)...I've just been laughing my head off (I've re-attached it, don't worry...thank God for Velcro, that's for sure)!! LOL that man is such a moron...e.g. "'It's amazing with the software that has been developed these days that enable a camera to distinguish the difference between a squirrel and a bomb" WTF??  Anyhoo....I've had a really great weekend, though am sad that it's over and as I sit here on a muggy Monday morning with the sweat running down my back (I swear I am the sexiest ever and I challange anyone who argues) I think that there's certainly something missing. And I adore my job and miss it when I'm not there, and look forward to going in every day. And yet still, when you know it's going to be another beer garden day, you can't help wondering if we have it all wrong going out to work etc. And if that's coming from someone who loves their job, I can't even imagine how those that aren't happy in work feel. I guess even though I've felt stiffled in jobs before I've always had my little group of people to cheer me up.  Yesterday I was looking through my piccies and stuff and I came across the cards I got when I left the insurance brokers (where i did my year's placement) and I've decided to get in touch with a few of the guys there again. You know it's so nice to read lovely things about yourself, huh?  Everytime I think of BB having ended I feel a little ache, how sad is that? I miss it and it's horrible. I'm feeling wuite put out that all of my fave tv programs are ending at the mo, and there's nothing to replace it all. You know I don't ask for much, I'm not so into watching TV, so it annoys me that the 5/6 programs that I love are no more...sort yourselves out TV making people!!  Okay so my weekend, Saturday I had to take my sister back home, which was an utter nightmare. Driving up the motorway for almost 3hours is not my ideal way to spend a saturday morning, and the drive back was no better. Thing is, I don't mind because my sister is, well she's my sister and like my bestest friend, you know? But I just think that she doesn't appreciate it. And the only thing stopping her from taking her driving test is that she won't do the theory, which is stupid, because she's passed it before, but it's expired, so I wish she'd just do it, because she'll be amazed at how much easier life is when you can drive (and that's coming from someone who hates driving!!)  AND then Saturday night we (paul, stu and I) went round to my parents' caravan and drunk a bit and played cards and dominos and scrabble. It was way way cool. Like when I was younger on bank holiday weekends we used to go in the caravan to various places around England, and used to have so much fun. I'd certainly recommend caravaning to anyone )lol look at me being a saddo with the caravanning but i'm really serious) because it's a great way to get away for the weekend without having to pay loads. And you can get to see so much of England that usually we'd just let go unnoticed. Anyway, so Saturday night was like being back there, and OMG i laughed so much at points. It was a muchly excellent night.  When we got back I was in a stay up all night and get drunk mood, so Stu and I went back to his, and played Trivial Pursuit. I won...because I'm the greatest at it, although on Sat night it was a very very close one, I'll give Stu that. Then we started to watch The Wedding Singer but I fell asleep because I'm a wimp with the staying up all night. So, I think I woke up at about 5am and decided to go home, because I was all sweaty (in fact that's now my normal state) and my breath was like amazingly pooey and I went in that 'can't walk' thing. You know when you first wake up and you're all confused and dazed and just stumbling around? I love that, it's like really cool...but doesn't make you the best company. So anyway, I stumbled home and made it upstairs, slumped into bed and slept for, oh 3 hours maybe. Then the unrelenting sun made an appearance one more and woke me up.  Yesterday we went shopping and I bought an obscene amount of new clothes...but I needed them, I swear...for my holidays! Now all I need to do is buy a new pair of flipflops then I'm done. Dammnit last night I dreamt I bought a pair of really cute flipflops that were really comfortable. I hate dreaming that I've done something then waking up and realising that you still have the thign to do, cos it's like you've already done it so it's boring and a waste of time having to do it again!!!  OMG we bought a Dyson vacuum cleaner and it freaked me out how much dust came up. Although our old hoover hasn't been picking dust up properly for ages so I shouldn't have been surprised. I'm sure gonna miss those hair balls though.  Last night my mum, dad,Paul and I went out for a Chinese because it was my mum's bday. (Happy Bday to my mum by the way.) It was absolutely gorgeous! We ate far far too much of course, by hey ho it's not like I'm entirely watching my weight at the mo :( Anyway, so that was really fun and we talked and talked for ages until we were the only ones left and the waiters etc were standing waiting for us to go lol.  Then was time to say goodbye, which was horrible as usual. I can't believe I live so far away from home sometimes. It's so bad and hard. And yet there's no way I can move back up there, certainly not at the moment. I just wrote some really sappy things about the reasons that I stay down here. Thing is if I am honest I feel like I don't belong right now. This house is not my home, my parent's have moved house and their new one is certainly not my home. And I know it'll probably be all different when we buy, but for now I feel like I'm just lodging at a mate's house or something. Which is really silly and quite weird considering we've lived in this house for over 2 years now. Anyway, so saying goodbye to my parents...majorly bad. One of my very dear friends said to me that "distance is only what we measure on a map and not what we feel in our hearts". That made me smile and feel a whole lot better by far. (thank you x)  So tonight's my late night so I'm just hanging a bit by the way. I am going to have a really cold shower in a mo, as is my morning thing to do when it's this hot. Do you know one of the worst things about the heat is that it means you have to change the sheets on your bed more often...who can be bothered to do that??!!! Eugh...it's just the mugginess that I can't stand. Eugh Eugh Eugh. Hurry up Winter....I miss you!!!!  Okay I'm really going to regret saying that!!  I felt so sorry for Becki (and would have felt sorry for Kitten but I can't stand her) when the housemates came up to sign autographs and shake people's hands, because everyone was shouting of eveyong else apart from them two. Becki looked so lost. Kitten looked pissed off, she's such a fruit loop. See how the day before she went into the BB house she being all medicated for her freaky nutcaseness? As if it wasn't 100% obvious that she...okay okay I have to stop because that really annoys me. I'm still in shock that I've found someone who can make me so angry and make my skin crawl just seeing a picture of her...LOL I've never understood that before and now I do, which makes me feel bad, because she hasn't actually done anything to me, but I guess it's human maybe. She just stands for everything that I don't like in women, and so it's natural I wouldn't like her.  And I've noticed something really weird about 'open minded' people. I was on the Channel 4 BB forum the other day because they had the awards thing for us to vote for, and I was looking through a few threads, and I realised that those that are so open minded and that stick up for human rights blah blah blah are actually really really closed minded. How can you say that someone is ignorant for thinking a certain way when all you're doing is projecting what you think is right onto everyone else and not contemplating that perhaps the people that are 'closed minded bigots' actually have a point? When someone starts a thread saying something controversial that people don't like, soooo many people jump all over it, and get so angry, when perhaps they fail to see that just because they are 'enlightened' and think a certain way, doesn't mean that everyone has to, and it doesn't mean their way of thinking is actually right. When you think about it, those that declare themselves 'open minded' are maybe the most bigoted in reality.  That's all I've got for the moment. Will write more this evening no doubt.  Have a wonderful, wonderful day....xx

      OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!! Friday night was just  the  best night in the whole wide world. Okay, so maybe it wasn't  the  the best night...that would make me pretty sad if I hadn't had any nights better, and believe me I've had a lot of gooooooood nights so far in my short stint on this Earth. But, Friday was definitely most excellent in every way! Oh my God you just can't imagine how cool it was with everyoen chanting and screaming and the housemates look sooo weird up close, like it's just freaky having watched someone for weeks and then seeing them being all real people. Anyway, it was just excellent in every way. LOL within 10mins of the show starting we went from totally lethargic and wanting to go home after having spent 6hours queueing in the belting hot sun (I am sooooo thankful to Helen for bringing umbrellas so that we had shade and soooo thankful to the organisers for providing water!!)  to just jumpin up and down shouting and cheering, it was just soooo cool!!! So when Dan came third I just exploded, I was soooo happy that Jason was going to come second, it was just amazing to be there and I feel so sorry for people who weren't there.(but not in a patronising way) YAAAAAY!!! Was sooooo worth the waiting and I'm really pleased that we went super early because the queue was already kinda medium sized and it went on for miles behind us!!  Damnit I'm sorry I have to go...I have to get ready then pick up my parents because we're spending the day doing stuff.  Will write more on what I've been up to later on or during the week. xx

      Hello lovely people!  First things first...thank you to my lovely boyfriend who saved my sanity by finding my clocking in card tonight. Tsk...couldn't find it at all this morning and couldn't remember where I'd put it...and I swear I looked absolutely everywhere for it...but like happens so many times, as soon as he looekd he found. How does that happen? I swear there's little pixies everywhere who like to play games and hide things or make things not work until someone else gives it a go...ah well, if it keeps them happy....  So my parents are here tomorrow...big massive yay!! Sarah's coming with them because of course we're all off to BB tomorrow afternoon. I'm so very sad about it all and I know I'm going to cry, which will make me look like a silly girl, which is not so bad, because I am a silly girl lol.  I really hope Jason wins now...I mean I know he won't, and that's cool, but he's my fave out of all of them now. I think because he's the only one who's actually stood up to the group mentality, although at this stage I don't care so much who gets it...I wanted Victor to win and he didn't so boo hoo lol.  OMG @ Stu being evicted...I so thought it would have been Shell. I mean I knew Stu wouldnt win, but I thought that he would have got the girlie vote, bless him...was the best eviction so far though. Am really pleased that we decided not to go though, would have driven me crazy being stood there from 6.30pm withough being allowed to make a noise, then being allowed to cheer for 10mins until he was whisked away for the interview!!  I don't want Shell to win really because she's done nothing, and is weak...she comes across as two faced because she's not strong enough to stand up to people. Then there's Dan, who isplaying the worst game ever. One thing I can't stand about people is whenthey are adamant that they're going to do something then they back down at the last minute. If you say you're going to do something, then just go ahead and do it...otherwise you're going to end up looking like and idiot.  And then there's Nadia, who is of course the funniest of all of them...but is annoying to boot, and I think that she's wrong to lie about things such as pretending that she can't have children because of some illness (was totally implied when she said about her inability to have children, which is fine, but at the end of the day no matter how she feels inside, she has chosen the way she lives) and that she hasn't had a boob job (d'uh!). And although of course it's up to her if she wants to keep her secret...why in the world would you tell everyone outside? I think anyone who would vote for her because she used to be a man and think that she should be praised for it is not half as advanced as they think they are. I really couldn't care less whether she used to be a man and don't see why she deserves to be acknowledged for it...in my opinion we've really come a long way when people dont' even see things like that and just accept people for who they are rather than what they are, rather than the way it is now where people think that you should be praised for beign gay or chaging your sex...imo they're only being what they are, and yeah it's hard, but we all go through hard things, I don't know why people feel the need to have it acknowledged by the whole world.  LOL...did I just come across as a prize bitch then? Oh well, I guess it's part of being human that we don't have to agree with everything. And maybe we shouldn't always keep things to ourselves for the sake of being PC.  I'm being nagged so much to publish this blog and I just want to say that fellow bloggers should understand that it's not good to pressure someone who is in the middle of a blog...blogs have to flow free and cannot be rushed. So there *sticks tongue out*  Oooooh i just had something catch in my throat...owwwwwww. It's ok now, made my eyes water though.  The newbies weren't in work today, they were all in training. That made my day so boring. Though I made a decision this morning to get lots of things I'd been putting off done...mostly just  dictation, which is my worstest thing...LOL who would have thought that the worst part of my job would be a bit that included talking? But seriously...I hate it. So I got all my dictation done today which is actually making me feel good now because it'd been hanging over my head in that I knew it had to be done at some point.  I've let myself down BIG time this week. I like to keep my back log to 2 weeks (which, if anyone knows where I work, is a massively low back log to have) and so this week I aimed to be up to the 23rd July, but today I was up to the 20th and tomorrow I'm on a half day, so it looks like I'm not going to make it. Thing is I only have about 10 peices of post and 10 diaries to do, but the post is all medical reports that I need to go through, which take me longer, and no way can I do it in 3 and a half hours. Its the first time I've not hit one of my targets, and I'm really disappointed in myself. I mean I know it doesn't matter, but it's narked me a lot.  Yay our weekend at Butlins is booked for the first weekend of October!!! I'm really really excited about that because it's going to be a total girlie weekend!!! HURRAH!!!  I think that's me anyway though...though I'm sure I've forgot lots, but need to go clean upstairs :) xx

      Hey there! Not much to write about again today, but feel I shouldn't let the side down and know I'll just get nagged later so thought I'd do a quick one...will try to drag it out as long as I can.  So, today training was very much more bearable. Half way through the day I kind of freaked out a bit though...for the past couple of weeks I've had this conversation keep running through y head and had no idea where it was coming from, but it was like a deja vu type feeling when i thought of it. Imagine how weird I felt when the trainer actually said the exact things that I have been thinking...most strange indeed. A bit boring actually but it made me feel really really weird indeed.  OMG there really is nothing I hate more than someone acting like they know more than you and arguing with you over something you know so much more than them on and when you know they are wrong and they just keep going on and on. Sometimes things are soooo much harder than they need to be.  Oh yeah...what the hÂ£ll are Kit Kat playing at??!!!! "Make the most of your break" !!!!!!!????? I dunno, I know they think that that is going to raise their sales, but I think they're overestimating the power that a slogan has over people. If I was in marketing I'd use my slogans to increase brand awareness, which 'Have a break, have a Kit Kat' inarguably does...who hasn't heard that? I think they're making a MASSIVE mistake and wouldn't be suprised if we have a ChocoPops/ChocoKrispies/CocoPops case on our hands here....but, as with so very many things in life, time will tell.  Anyway, really all I'm feeling tonight is that I just want some peace and quiet...I really really do.  xx

      Well well well, here I find myself again.  Today I've been in training, as I will be tomorrow too. Probably for the best because the whole company's email system was down for most of the day and it would have driven me crazy had I been sitting at my desk (you know me with the emailing!!).  However, from about 2pm I had a case of the noddy head thing...you know, when you're just about to drop off and your head goes...how much of a good impression must I have made? Though it does make me giggle my heart out like mad when other people are like that. I was actually dreaming at some points, and trying to keep my eyes open..probably looked like I'd been possessed with my eyes rolling all around the place like Regan.  The heat is really getting to me. I love hot weather when I'm just hanging around...but when I'm at work and then in the evenings it's just soooooooooooooooo hot!!  Oh, had to go get my tax this morning. Stu freaked me out yesterday with talk of the possibility I'd be clamped...so I was freaking all morning. Then I found out we were having lunch supplied to us in the room so I wouldn't have time to go into town at lunch, so I had to go after work, and was praying all the way that I wouldn't have a crash. I forgot the amount of times I promised God I'd learnt my lesson already so there was no need to make me crash to teach me it...and I meant it, I swear I'm going to be more organised from now on. Weird how I'm like the most organised person ever at work and then my home life is a big pile of total chaos lol.  Right I'm afraid that's all from me, I was going to make it a deep one but at the moment that's really not a good idea. Also I'm quite afraid that when I eventually open my mouth to say(or use my fingers to type) the things that have been playing on my mind, there'll no taking it back. And we humans are creatures of habit...that's more true than I realised. God knows what all that means.  Catch you later. xx  whoops...ps I've updated my website,  urlLink www.karenhome.co.uk  I've put some of the piccies from my Bday BBQ and Alton Towers up so check it out. xx

      Hello there my little lovelies.  Not sure what I have to write about today...am feeling muchly sleepy. This may have something to do with the fact that I was brutally (yes, brutally!!) woken at 7.40am this morning!  7.40am!!  On a Sunday morning!!! And the worst thing was I couldn't be too angry about it because I was actually woken by my lovely (*cough*) boyfriend, who had cooked me bacon and eggs for breakfast and brought it up on a tray so I could have breakfast in bed. Awwwww  Okay, okay...hold the awwwwws and go back a few sentences....7.40am!!!! And perhaps the most disturbing thing about this episode is that before the cooking of the breakfast, he'd already been up and out to fill his car with diesel...I swear that boy is so far away from normal sometimes.  Anyway, so I ate a tiny bit of the bacon but couldn't eat anymore, because my body is not designed to ingest food until it's actually legal to be awake. I felt a bit bad about that, but still...I did totally appreciate the thought.  OMG One of my very dear friends is a fire warden too...and they get a jacket!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And it's got a big flourescent sign on the back saying Fire Warden. What the HÂ£ll do my employers think they are doing trying to fob me off with a frickin' arm band??!!!! That is not good. Okay, I just decided the jacket thing is maybe taking it a tad too far...but I'm only saying that out of jealousy.  I'm watching Starsky and Hucth now...it's not so good but there are some really funny bits that have had me giggling my heart out.  I'd better go now...VERY Hot and bothered...need to just lie out and be all hot and moany.  Catch u later guys ;-) xx
