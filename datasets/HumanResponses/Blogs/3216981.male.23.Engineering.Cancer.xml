      So after the grueling task of moving out of my apartment, I began to feel a little under the weather.  I decided to go against my usual reaction to illness (suck it up, take it like a man, and ignore it) and I went to the doctor.  Come to find out I have bronchitis and a sinus infection, you know not the kind of stuff you want to come down with before a trip to Europe.  Luckily the doctor said I had plenty of time to binge on antibiotics, sip on some sizurp, and get completely better. This may be a blessing in disguise, after two weeks of rest and medication there's no doubt I will be 100% ready to pillage the continent of Europe.

      Guys I don't know what you've heard, but I've always heard that British women were dog ugly.  Well I'm here to set the record straight.  Hands down this town is loaded with georgous women.  I'm talking drop dead georgous, everywhere you look, women.  Whats great is they love to hear us "southern boys" talk.  If you can even call my accent southern.  I asked this hottie directions for some directions and she immediately giggled and asked where I was from.  When I told her Alabama, she immediately replied I love your accent.  So if you ever make your way across the pond try to play the "southern gentleman" card as much as possible.

      Sorry I haven't been putting up more posts, but its been hard finding time and a location for me to get on the internet.  Over the last three days Brantley, Don, and I have seen just about every major attraction in London, including: Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Horse Guards, Admiralty Arch, National Gallery which featured Monet, Picasso, Rembrant, & Michanelgo among others, Tower of London, Tower Bridge, Shakespear's Globe Theatre, and even a Speak Easy.  The dollar is very weak over here so it has cut into our ability to find trouble during the night.  The wildest of clubs have a cover of 15 - 30 GBP which equates to about 25- 55 dollars, so needless to say we've avoided them.  Also most of the pubs close at 11:00, which really sucks.  I did however stumble upon a real life speak easy.  I was having a conversation with one of the million old man local drunks at our hostel and he tipped me off to the pub next door that served "great" beer.  So Don and I ended up walking over there to have a couple of pints when around midnight the lights at the bar just suddenly went out.  Not knowing what was going on I asked this friendly Scotish musician what was going on.  He preceded to explain to me that it was legally time for the bar to close but this particular one just shuts the lights and stays open late.  So we drank beer for about an hour in the dark.  What the funny part was is everyone else in the bar was obviously a regular because when the lights went out they didn't miss a beat.  They continued to order drinks, play pool, and even throw darts.  Yeah definately some hardcore booze hounds.  I guess the next time I'm in London and have a hankering to drink extremely late at a pub I'll know exactly where to go.

      Unfortunately our plane was delayed in Atlanta.  Luckily we made our connection in D.C. and the flight was very easy.  The airlines have definately upgraded entertainment and food.  Even in coach, we all had our own monitors and could select from 15 tv channels.  After we landed in London we made our way to the underground and took the trains to the location our map said the hostel would be at.  Unfortunatly it was WRONG, and when I say wrong I mean completely wrong.  We wondered the streets of London for at least an hour before we had the fortune of meeting this HALLARIOUS couple.  The man looked like an old, drunk Mr. Magoo.  But they got us on the right track and we made it to our hostel.

      Tonight we are going to hop the overnight train to Zurich...thank god.  I am so ready to leave Amsterdamn...I'm glad I went but I won't be going out of my way anytime soon to get back.  We are only going to be in Zurich for the day.  There we plan on seeing the largest clock face and the home Einstein was born in.  Brantley and Don both want to buy some cheap watches but I've been hearing with internet and factory direct shippping the watches wont be that much cheaper.  The next night we are planning on taking the overnight train to Florence.  Its cool that they have these overnight trains because from what "Europe on a Shoestring" and "Frommers" has said there isnt much to see other than beautiful scenery and the above listed items.  Once in Florence we plan on seeing the Statue of David.  There are a couple of galleries and exhibits we might try to see.  After we see the hot spots its only a hour and a half to Roma.  We're staying that his pimp ass hostel.  Its right in the middle of everything and seems really well kept.  I'll tell you one thing it wont be Amsterdamn...which is good.  Till next time.

      Today we saw Anne Frank's house.  It was extremely powerful.  I think that everyone who ever ventures to Amsterdamn must see it.  It was absolutely crazy walking around that tiny attic and seeing first hand where the famous Anne Frank and her family hid for the Nazis.  The price to get it was rather steep but after touring the museum I feel it was worth it.

      So we're at day two in Amsterdamn and I honestly have to say I'm ready to leave.  Amsterdamn is alot like New Orleans but with a completely different way more dangerous element lurking down every street and alley. I've spoken with a ton of tourists and people that work in the bars here and literally just about everyone says this place is fishy.  We also keep hearing about people getting drugged and robbed not to mention that you can't walk 20 feet without some local offering you extasy or coke.  I guessed I figured this place would be a huge party which in some ways it is but here I highly recommend you keep your wits about you because the second you drop your guard someone will be there to take advantage of you.

      WOW this town is exactly what I expected and more.  We pulled into Amsterdamn around 7 in the evening but thats cool because over here it doesn't get dark untill 10 or 11.  We wandered around the city and finally found our place.  The staris are about 6 inches deep and steep as hell...if you make one wrong step you could easily break your neck.  It turns out that its just a couple of rooms some guy rents out.  There are about 8 other people staying in our room.  One guy is from New Zeland, and is a pretty nice guy.  We unloaded our stuff and went to check out the city.  We frequented several of the bars and cafes which were very very very very wild.  Fuck Las Vegas...Amsterdamn is easily holding the top spot on the sin city list.  Apparently the biggest craze over here is to run off to Budapest for fun.  All the kids we come across talk about taking off for the weekend to Budapest, partying all weekend, and then making it back in time for work on Monday.  So we've adjusted our travel plan to check out the insanity.  From what we've heard the bars and clubs stay open 24/7 the dollar is strong as hell, and the women can't get enough of American guys.  Till next time....

      If you guys ever get a chance to come to Budapest...take it.  The exchange rate is 209 forints to 1 dollar.  Even the tourist traps are cheap.  We took a half day bus tour for almost nothing and we have been eating like kings for just a few dollars.  The bars are fun but you have to avoid clubs.  Everyone we have talked to sternly told us that we will get robbed or worse if we go there.  Most of the stories we have heard have included Hungarian women approaching American men, seeming real cool, and then getting the guys to buy them a drink.  When the bill comes it turns out to be like 1000 dollars and if you do not pay they will rough you up etc...  Tomorrow we venture to Prague which is should be cool.  I have heard nothing but good about Prague so I am looking foward to it.

      We've just finished our third day and Roma and I have to say it is the best city I've seen so far.  Its definately not the cleanest, and definately the hottest, but its guarenteed that at every corner you turn you'll see something amazing.   Its just crazy to see these monuments that are absoultely enormous and still standing today.  Today we toured the Vatican.  It was breath taking.  The Creation of Man and the Sisteen Chapel was cool and the St. Peters Bacilla was overwhelming.  Tomorrow we head to Budapest.  All we here is how its the trendy fun place to go in Europe.  The exchange rate is kick ass and we've heard the clubs dont close till late.  Wish me luck....

      WOW so I have been walking around Roma and to my shock I have noticed that the mullet is the latest craze.  Everywhere you look local Romans are sporting the mullet. It is the funniest thing I have ever seen.  Whats also funny is they go all out.  They cuff up there jeans and flare out their collars.  I am wondering if the style is going to hit the US...I hope not.
