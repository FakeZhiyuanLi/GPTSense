        Yeah, a pretty normal day today. Started with school. Spoke with  Mikaella  to invite her with Padawanderley here, she is busy till friday. Experimented a new deck at school, but it needs tweaking, a lot in fact.  Wanderley  came to my house from 2hpm to 8hpm. We played halo with my brother for an hour, and i  introduced  Soldat  to him. Thinks he like it quite a lot, but not as much as  Battlefield 1942 . I admit myself being a Battlefield addict, it's so nice and realistic.   Also, played 1 hour of Soldat with  Julien . Played on 3 servers, then i decided to make my own, it was too slow on 2 of them, and the 3rd was filled with veterans. It was a lot of fun. Also speaked a bit about Halo II  with him. He said he will ship me the collector's edition for free! Thanks Julien!   Started to fantasm again on  LaRonde . My father suggested a season pass for the 3 weeks, i'm not against the idea, but it may be difficult to get  Frozen Throne  in the end.   Read some stuff on Belgium Beers.  Stela Artois , i want to try this one if i ever get the chance.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink       To see the correct stats, click the picture, it will get bigger. So, as you can guess, i was Zephyr.(Duh) Remember i have been playing this for a few days only, so i still consider myself a newb.(Newcomer with very little respect earned from the others) Anyway i enter the game, check the weapons selection...They removed my M79 and my Socom!What would become of me?!? Oh well, i take the Steyr and the Bazooka. The Steyr Aug is a bit more difficult to use than the M79, and the bazooka... I started playing and could'nt believe what i wasd doing! I was owning everyone, imagine neo againts the agents at the end of The Matrix. I was second the 2 first rounds, third one i got first, I had only time to take a picture then the admin banned me.  I finally emerged from the Noob state, call me an Middle Level now!  Bow down before my power!  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        woke up at almost two o'clock this afternoon. After speaking a bit with Zyphern, decided to install  Msn Messenger Plus 3.0  on my old  Msn6b . Gave me a lot of adware at first, so i uninstalled and saw it was a selection in the install. Everything works fine now, cool new features!   I had some issue with the plug-ins(Yes,  Msn messenger  plus now supports various plug-ins) for  Winamp .I decided to uninstall them after some major bugs in my music player. Gave some suggestions on how to improve  Soldat  in the official forums yesterday. I received the following feedbacks today."Shut up you Bitch" and stuff of the same kind. It's sad to see that a lot of  Soldat  players are idiots...   Well that's all, guess i'll play some more  Soldat , i really tought about registering the game, it would greatly help.

        Add a talk with a friend from canada about what i planned to do in the future. It kinda resonate in my head, only one answer : nothing. Not only have i no idea, but also i feel like nothing is the answer. Everyone as a dream, after thinking about it,i have none. I see life as something without meaning. In the end, you die and your forgotten. What is the meaning of existence?   It's true i spend all my time on my pc, but i don't feel like anything else is important anymore... It as been like that for a few years now. What happened? I remember i used to like gym classes, had fun doing maths, i already loved school. Why is it i hate all those things now? What changed?   It's one of those times where you feel broken and hopeless. I feel like that too often is seems. Wishing you were someone else, that things did'nt turn out the way they turned. I really can't understand. I just feel misplaced and in the wrong direction. I wonder how everyone manage to go on with their lives without these interrogations. Everyone is so sure of themselves, looks like i missed a complet chapter of the book of life.   July again, it was july last year, i tought it would be my escape door. In fact it was just a new cell. I tough all my problems and toughts would vanish, but they did'nt. they took hold of me even harder. May this July be more meaningful for my existence...   Wow, i feel like a writer! Well, Bruno should be done with the downloads by now, so let's play some soldat!  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Here it is, one card of the new set. Fifth Dawn! They look incredible. I wish i could buy the story books,  Mirrodin  universe look so rich and full of cool stuff. Anyway, 2 bad news. I got my Akroma and my Phage stolen! I'm really pissed now. Also i installed a new game called GunBound. I got my ass kicked every single time so i got bored, it's uninstalled now.   Speaked all afternoon with  Euphemia . She is having difficulties with baby Sitting. Let's prey for her good health! I am bored now, and it's allready 11h00pm. What should i do?  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        A artwork of my most beloved sin and need. Warcraft III expansion set,  The Frozen Throne . Been thinking about re-installing Warcraft III, but it takes too much space.   Checked a bit of cards from  DarkSteel  and  Mirrodin  on the official Wizards web site. Also saw some Fifth Dawn preview cards. Also had a look at the really cool  Core Set  (But so expensive).   I'll post some cards i saw that are very cool.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        The title sums it up pretty much. You saw this sentence appearing in my screen so often. That was so funny, we downloaded a new map called city. 2 skyscrapper and 1 house in the middle. I wanted to use the barret for the first time, that was hilarious. He was flying in the sky like a bird, and immediatly felt down in blood. Yay for advanced weaponry!   Just a quick update to say i had crazy fun for an hour. Anyone reading this should try  Soldat , completely crazy!   My arm itch, i don't know why...  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Played a lot of Soldat today. Noticed something. Whenever i play on a server (Pro or Beginner), i always end 2nd-to-5th. I think i am really getting the hand on this game. I wish i could be good enough and enter a clan or championship, i will get famous!   Also did some shopping with my mom, checked some furniture. Walking down the street i found something completely crazy! A shop that sells magics cards! Godamn it, i was so happy. I bough a booster pack of Darksteel and got a few good cards, i will add them to a green deck today.   Nothing new except that, i was out pretty much all day long. My brother Simon annoyed me a lot to get my Xbox. He will probably continue to do so...   Spoke a bit with  Michelle , she is cool, but afraid of everything. Wonder why...  Regards,  Zephyr

        Wow, it's already 10h30 P.M! Hard to believe, but i have been playing Soldat nonstop all day long. I have found my weapons of choice.A  Steyr Aught and a Socom, or a M79 Grenade Launcher and a Socom. I really like the speed, fast paced gameplay of this. It's funny, i expected Tribes 2 to be similar when i first downloaded it.   Had some talk with my parents, flamed a bit. It's not always fun, but sometimes necessary. Can't wait for July, so much stuff and people to see! I may be able to get a hand on Frozen Throne, finally!(Been dreaming of it since late september)   I am going to sleep soon enough.

       urlLink        What could that picture be? Well, after looking at some more small games like Jumper, i found a lot more stuff. It was inevitable, i would discover a True Multiplayer showdown. Here it is : Soldat. I would like to give details about it, but it has to be discovered on your own. As a 10 meg file (Free) You have the  OBLIGATION  to try it, it's goddamn original! Here is a list of server i play on : http://lobby.soldat.pl:13073/ . I am Lucidique In-Game. One thing great about that server list is that if you have the game installed, just click the link and the game will start in the server!   Soldat Client(10.3Mo)   http://www.soldat.pl/  No Gincana Today, i slept until 10, looks like english class will be reported again...

       urlLink       Greetings. Today i attended the gincana.(Some may say it was about time.) i did not contribute to my team, but helped Helder and the Dii Aqua. Stayed until 10'o'clock. Escaped with my brother, hell it was a bit boring. I searched for wanderley everywhere, did'nt find him.   Also played a lot of Tetris today. I did'nt play it for more than a year. I found a couple of different version wich will now live inside my hard drive. The picture you see is the  neave  version of tetris ( Check ancients posts for url, it's free). I also digged up  Tetris 4000  wich is very nice. I just finished downloading  Tetris Master , i will have a look at it in a few minutes.   Did a bit of Photoshop tutorials yesterday. I will post some of my works tommorow, check back!  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        I found this article by pure mistake on google while searching for a model of an inverted knee robot. This article is named My Search for the Holy Grail of immortality. Writed by Emeagwali in 2003. Trough the basic of a "Prediction of the future". Emeagwali explain a bit on how will technology works in 50-60-90-100 years in the future. Some of the stuff he says appear to makes sense, some of it does'nt. Something striked me tought.   As Emeagwali describe that Computers and the internet can only be viewed from a physical point of view (The internet is 10,000 kms of fiber ropes that interconnect all computers in order to facilitate Human communication). He put emphasys on the fact that computers, in the future, interlinked with the net, will form a kind of Brain. Considering the fact that in 100 plus years, computer will be a lot more faster, everything will work extremely fast. Also one thing to be considered is the electronic implants.   "In 300 years, I believe that the Internet will remain a spherical network as large as the whole world. However, because it could be a zillion times more powerful, faster, and more intelligent, I believe that in 300 years the Internet will evolve into a SuperBrain as large as the whole world."    this sums it up a bit. There is more.   "Without realizing what we are doing, we are determined to redesign ourselves. Our compelling urge to redesign ourselves is deep-seated and will remain so. We have embarked on a self-propelled evolution in which we are both the creator and the created.   Already, we have imbedded our consciousness and intelligence into computers. Now that we have implanted our intelligence into computers, we are now figuring out how to imbed our computers into our brain. That is, how to imbed inanimate intelligence into animate ones."   This is were it gets completely logical, in the end, we survived since pre-historic age as a team.Still today, everyone is linked in society.   He explain that at some part, everyone will be linked as 1 Brain.   "Unification implies that we will become one people. With one voice. One will. One soul. And one culture. "   "We will understand that we are not human beings that exist separately from other beings. Instead, we may come to believe that we are small and separate beings that exist within a Super Being."    "I began by studying the interconnectedness between millions of computers configured around the Earth. I learned that interconnected computers do emulate one supercomputer. I then inferred that we could use that knowledge as a metaphor for living entities, which we also know, are interconnected.   Therefore, I have inferred that interconnected animals and plants do emulate one Super Being."    Ok it's a bit long, but i suggest you have a read.  http://emeagwali.com/speeches/immortality/my-search-for-the-holy-grail-of-immortality.html  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink       Cool? Indeed, it's my first ever accomplished tutorial on Adobe Photoshop 7.0. God this version is just the greatest! Took me some time to figure out where was the Linear Dodge Option. I know it look a bit crappy, just remember it's my first tutorial. A lot more coming soon!   Also i started some basic tutorials of Html as you can see now :        This part of my post is all typed in HTML!        Anyway, it started out easily, but i am sure it will get complicated. Played a bit of Zyphern's custom levels on Jumper. He needs practice at editing...  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink         Ok so, as you can see here with the picture, i kinda made a logo for my blog. I think it's simple and looks good. (It's starring at you!) I'm having a bit of problems with the template. I am trying to make my banner (Similar to this picture) fit at the spot where you see the title of the blog. Tried a bit with my mother(She knows html) and it did'nt work. I will check a bit more on Blogger or maybe Google it after. If anyone has some information as for the code to input an image from an url to the title, please comment this post!   Also i have been messing with the Jumper Editor 2.2. I made two quick new maps. One is easy and fast and the other require some quick thinking. It's a zip file accessible from this url   Static Galore(253Ko) + Weak Minded(250Ko)   http://www.geocities.com/darksurfaceteam/jumpercustomzephyr1.zip  If the link is dead/Broken, try it a bit later...  Some Infos on how to play custom levels on Jumper:  1.Open Jumper editor. (You can get it from the url provided in the Interaction With A Jumper post) 2.Select load map from the built-in menu. 3.Get the file from where you unzipped it. 4.Press Play. 5.Voila!    The process of doing custom maps is pretty similar. If anyone who read this decide to make new maps, you can send them to me at fulgor28@hotmail.com . I will be happy to play them. I will also publish the best custom maps on a ulterior posts. So check soon. Anyway i'll be making more soon enough.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Well my father did'nt wake me up...don't know why. Anyway, to sum up some of the stuff i found yesterday. After playing a bit of Jumper (See  Interaction With A Jumper  for more informations), i checked the link to see directly where it came from. After few researchs on the owners website, i discovered http://www.neave.com/. I must say it's one of the most original website i have seen in ages. i also found some cool stuff on it. He as a game section were you can play them on the site, download them to windows or Mac, or even apply the flash code to your website! To name a few : Pacman, Asteroids, Tetris, Simon Says, hexxagon and snake. They are hand coded by him and are of great quality. Try them!   Neave game section  (All Free)  http://www.neave.com/games  I think i will sleep a bit more, my mom waked me up to open the computer so she can access the internet.I still can't wait for July, it's gonna be such a great month!

       urlLink        A quick update before i go sleep. I was going trought the forums pages and found this little gem. Name of the file is Jumper. The zip file actually contain 2 of them : jumper 1.1 and jumper editor 2.2. A really cool arcad-ish platform game. As you can see from the picture, it's a little bit old on the graphics. Surprisingly, it takes quite a lot of memory to run it. I scanned and it's virus free. You can download the .zip file from this url.    Jumper 1.1(2.63Mo) + Jumper Editor 2.2(2.08Mo)   http://www.gameshade.com/dex/YMM/Jumper.zip    Have a look and see if you like, it gets a litte difficult after 2-4. I will post some custom level i will do when i have some time, check tommorow or a few days after!  Regards,  Zephyr

        Played a lot of Netstorm tonight. Got owned pretty much all the time. Yay for level advantage! It destroy all the fun that game could give.   Already 9h08. I want to play something, but nothing comes to my mind. I guess i'll watch a movie. I tought of Playing Battlefield 1942 or maybe Counter-Strike. I feel like playing a new strategy game tought. Maybe Red Alert II off Kazaa Lite?   I guess i'll get my brothers t.v and watch 2 Fast 2 Furious...  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Pretty soft afternoon. Talked a bit more with Euphemie. It's the first time she is online in the week! Also tweaked a bit of stuff and discovered that there was a huge amount of Custom Templates on other websites. I'll have a look.   Played a bit of Duke Nukem 3D. I love this game.Also tried to do a custom map in NetStorm, but it crashes to desktop,wonder why. Also i entered the online server to play a bit, i found 3 persons on ring 13.2 of these persons were level 43 and a guy named meteor was level 1 (As me). So the two 43 level guys proposed a 1 vs. 1 between me and Meteor, The upper levels would give us advice. After some quick speaking and action, i proceeded to beat the crap out of meteor. As my golem putted his high priest on the altar, my priest started the ritual and his priest was sacrificed to the furies! Enough babling, i got friend with the master player who helped me.   I guess that's all, tomorow is Gincana and i will probably chat on X-Chat or have a talk with some friends... May as well re-install Warcraft III and duel.  Regards,  Zephyr

       Ok, this week is a special competition week at school. Also it does happen i go to the school who as the biggest celebration. Complete week without classes, only activities! So my father wake me up this morning and say "School Time!". I decided to stay here and sleep. Is that life or not? I will be going to school tommorow anyway and see what is going on. I planned to come home with Wanderley and Mickaela anyway after.   As for the Blog stuff, http://www.blogger.com/ is incredible. Pretty everything is customizable, and easily(And thats not even the Html editor i am talking about!). Slowly i'll make more change. I added a visitors counter by Xiti.com. An 18 line code after, it works, unfortunately it will not go public until i see how exactly it works. The icon is there tought, it's an obligation for free users.   Not much plan today, i will call wanderley for my Activity Shirt, also i may Join Zyphern's Addiction Blog to help him a bit.  Any comments?  Regards,  Zephyr

       A friend of mine, Zyphern from Canada, asked me to try something. Not eager at first, i slowly installed the small 15.8Mo file and started it.It was a game, a old game it seemed. I started the tutorial missions with meager interest only to discover how cool and interesting it was! So here i present it to you.   The name of the game is Netstorm. It is an old title made by Activion wich is now an abandonware (Means that the full version is downloadable on the net at no fee in total legality). Netstorm is a Real Time Strategy with 2d graphics in a fictional fantasy world. It is a little bit difficult to explain. Try the early missions yourself and see if you like it. I love!  NetStorm(15.8Mo)(executable install file) is available right here :  ( http://www.netstormhq.com/download.php?view.1 )   By the way, it as a big feel of Starcraft and Magics The Gathering combined. Have a look and forge your opinion!   Paulo lended me a bit of stuff yesterday. -Pokemon Silver for GameBoy Color -GameBoy Camera -around 20 Dvds for my parents to watch   Thanks Paulo for all these, i guess i'll be busy for quite a while :-)   Also i tried to play a little bit with the comments. If you wish to drop me a line, you will need to register on the page itself (Comments). Only need to register once, then it's ok. (Probably to reduce spam and stuff.)

      **Possible Editing, remember i am still doing tests!**   Ok, a lot of cool stuff happened this weekend, let's start by the beginning!   Friday   I was bored of mIRC 5.91 full so i switched for X-Chat (It was recommenced by iJeff a few weeks ago). Works like a charm.There is those custom server buttons for quick access, i love it way more that that piece of junk mIRC is.   Saturday   Speaked with Euphemie, a friend from Canada. A really cool girl, i wish she could connect more often! At night i was with paulo Pimentel and Gabriel Drummond, we took the bus to Guara and eated at McDonald. 2 trios and a stomac pain after, i was home. The dog escaped the house, we searched for him all nigh long...   Sunday  Speaked a bit with my cousin on Skype ( http://www.skype.com/ ) and with my girlfriend over Msn. I also had such a cool surprise. Mayra finally connected on msn. I was really happy,she is so cool. A cute face,also! I had the idea of starting that blog after watching her blog.  No news as for when i'm going to start paying to play on Ragnarok Online...should be soon enough.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        School just finished, last test was the simulado, a  5-questions-for-each-subject test . I went with  Helder  to the  Nitro Lan House  (a new place near the school). I wanted to install  Pandoras Tomorrow  but computers were all full, so we waited for 15 minutes. When we got computers, noticed there was no cd on mine, so i just played  Command & Conquer Generals . Slow computer, took 10 minutes to load the first map, anyway the game was ugly. After that i booted  Cs , it was the wrong version and it jammed, got out of there and met my mother in the street, we went with 2 of my brothers to a restaurant. Went back home and here i am!   Yeah, so 7 days before  Canada , can't wait to be there. Also, we are moving soon!   Made up my mind and i will buy  Homeworld II  if i have the chance in Canada, it's top innovation and deserve to be played a lot.   Well, i'll probably update a bit later, just wanted to cover the 3-days i did'nt.   Oh and if you see no update, it may be because we will have our internet connexion disconnected by  Telefonica , since we are moving and stuff. So basically, if it happens, expect the next update the 9th in the afternoon.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Yesterday i found the greatest game of all time, and it's only the demo! I found the original online and it's quite cheap. The name of that awesome gem is  Homeworld 2 . The detail of the graphics on my pc is quite impressive, plus the gameplay is something extremely fresh.   Helped my father to transport some stuff at the appartment today, pretty much all my movies and computer games are there now, only my computer and clothes needs to be moved. (as well as some random stuff i forgot)   After that i went to  Wanderley 's house and played  magics  a bit.  Caillo  came without being invited. (I hate that guy)When he left, we planned to play a bit of  D&D  but i had to leave.   Played a bit more Homeworld and listened to the  Shenmue  Soundtrack. Damn, if there is a game i'm going to miss playing on my  xbox , it certainly is Shenmue II!   English tests tomorrow hahahahaha!  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Nothing special arrived today. I slept a lot, woke up at 12h00, got on the net. While talking to some friends on  msn , i got accross fileplanet and noticed that  Ground Control  (From  sierra ) is now free to download. It's a nice game, but i just tried the  Homeworld II  demo and THIS is a threat. It's actually the game with the best graphic displayed on my screen since i bought it in 2003.   Got bitched around by a girl on msn, why can't people leave you alone when you need to? I believe you don't need to be  Einstein  to understand that.  2 more tests this week and then it's finished until August, Canada, here i come!  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Had 2 tests today at school. Both of them were quite difficult. Took me an hour or so. Right after school, we went to the appartment to bring all the furnitures on level 5. Took all afternoon, but now only a few things are missing.   Received 6 invites for  gmail , gave 1 to  Helder  and 1 to  Justin . They were both happy about it. Also i'm trying a complete transition over Gmail and just drop  hotmail  if possible. It is said on Gmail that it will become a  pop3  soon.   Also, after the satisfaction provided by  Mozilla's Firefox , i decided to install  Thunder Bird , their E-mail pop3 client. I have yet to experience it, as soon as gmail turns pop, it will be done.   Well, tomorrow is maths test, hell in a can.   I'm tired so good night to the few souls who read this.

It does all so happen my mother was going all day to buy the new furnitures for the appartment, so if i wanted decent stuff, i had to go and select it myself, thing that i did. We shopped for like 6 hours straight. We stopped at a cool restaurant with excellent food. Met  Josee Roberto , teacher at Americana, he will have a meeting with me for english classes (Godamn it).   You probably won't believe it, but i actually studied today! I'm proud of myself, finally something i can achieve! I wish it could be like that everyday!   Also another hard thing to believe, as you probably noticed, the banner has appeared. I'm still trying to remove the google add and maybe restructure, thanks to the help of my comrad  Zyphern .   Spoke a lot with  Mishaga . She is a bit sad, i will do my best to make her smile as much as possible.   Tests tomorrow, i hope to get good grades for a change.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        I found those covers on the net. I frequently play  The Ninjawarriors  on  Snes . I also never understanded why there was 2 versions of it released on the same system with different names, one named The Ninjawarriors and another named  The Ninjawarriors Again . After reading a bit on the subject, it seems there was a  amiga  game named The Ninjawarriors, so the snes version is simply a remake. I hope i get the chance of playing the amiga version, it looks really cool.   Downloaded  America's Army  ( a file of 745mo). It's nice ,but it does'nt really have that special feeling i was expecting out of it. I simply uninstalled, i believe  Counter-Strike  (even if boring as hell) as a little more originality to it.   Had a argue with my parents about study and stuff. I will study at least 1 hour each day, i have to do it, even tought i really don't have the will for it.   I spoke a bit with  Renata Gazini  ( Ana Eliza 's friend!). She would like to have the photos we took on  Helder 's camera, and as well chat on  msn . I gave her my  Google  mail and my msn, altought she did not log on today (guess she only enter on weekends like all the rest here).   Oh well, i'm tired and i have nothing special to do, so better go sleeping early!  Regards,  Zephyr

        Sorry for the lack of updates, i was a bit busy with the english work. It's been a week now with  Firefox  and it runs perfect! I also noticed that i contract no spywares instead of 40 per weeks! No new update for  gmail  as they did not give me any invites yet.   I don't know if i mentioned it earlier, but  Paulo  lended me  Dungeon Siege . What a blast. It's like  Baldur's Gate , except it's not boring! Still nothing for  Pandoras Tomorrow , except the fact that  Helder  wants to try it at all cost, altought he perfectly know it will not run on his pc.   Mmm, yeah, did a lot of cleaning in my room for the appartment. Almost everything is in boxes and only require transport to the building. My mother is sick since about 3 days, some breathing problems. She is at the hospital right now, let's hope it's not cancer.   2 days until the exams start , and next week, thursday, it's vacation.   Also we found who stole my cards.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Traveled to  San Jose Dos Campos  for the whole day, it was nice. We checked for furniture, eated at the restaurant and bought a bit of stuff. This is where it all start. I saw a shop, actually two of them selling recent games for all platforms.(WOA!) Saw a lot of cool  Game Boy Advance  games, but nothing i was looking for. The other shop, it was different.  Unreal Tournament 2004 ,  Far Cry ,  True Crimes  and lot of other recent titles, i was amazed. Rest assured, i bought a game, altought not everything went well. I did'nt notice on the box that my 3d card was the only model that was not supported. It's sad, it's gonna cost me even more money to try  Splinter Cell Pandora's Tomorrow . It looks very good tought.   I also attended the  Fiesta De Juno  at school tonight. I met  Wanderley  and the  Japanese , eated a  Churros  and drank a bit of  Hot Whine . I also met  Barbara , she is cool. She was a bit sad that i left early, actually it was a bit boring.   Found the main song from  Kingdom Hearth , i have been listening to it in loop for an hour now.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Aleph One  is the codename of the port. The real name of the game is  Marathon . Marathon is the first title of a serie of 3 chapters (Marathon,  Durandal  and  Infinity ).  So basically, Marathon is  Bungie 's early attempt to Fps (before  Halo ). If you want a feel of what Bungie did before the  xbox  hit blockbuster, now is the time.  What i propose here is completely legal, the build is out of  Source Forge  and come with the free license and stuff so you won't get into any problems. This game was a  Mac  game, so it may not run perfectly on your pc.  Here are the files you need in order to start playing Aleph One - Marathon.   -Marathon Source code-  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/marathon/AlephOne-Windows-20040417.zip?download  -Aleph One's Marathon Port-  http://orbitalarm.bungie.org/downloads/alephone.html    ---Details on how to install---  Windows : Just download both zip files and extract them. Just copy Marathon file into Alephone file and go in marathon, just click the icon. Important : Windows user download the Special Windows Version of Aleph one on the website.  Mac Os 9 : Same thing, but you also need the latest version of SDL library (1.2 if possible) extracted in the alephone directory. ---   Understand that i cannot provide support for the Mac users, your on your own. I have been able to make it work easily on Windows, so should you.  If you have questions about the game that i cannot answer, try on bungie.net

       urlLink        See that picture? If your not already jaleous, it means you have no idea what it is. I will tell you all mere mortals what it is.  Gmail  is the new project of  Google.com . Pretty simple, a bottomless e-mail account with cool features. There is actually a bottom, but 1,000 mo is quite a bottom!   Getting a Gmail account is quite easy... Just joking it is not. There is only 2 ways to proceed. You can add your mail to the drawing list (Wich may not necessarly get you one) or simply receive an invite from a person already a member. So basically, as a member you also have 3 invites to give to some of your friends in order to create webs, ingenious, isn't it?   So , you probably all ask yourself : "To who will  Alex  give these incredibles Gmail invites?"   Well, to peoples who frequently use e-mails, that is! I am planning some kind of contest/fun/thing on  msn , then again maybe not. I will think about it.    Oh and you can contact me on  lucidique@gmail.com  !Muhahahahahahahahahah!

       urlLink        Such is the slogan of  Firefox . Pretty nice browser, replace totally  Internet Explorer . I also have  Netscape Navigator 7.1 , it's cool and have a lot of features, but the template start to annoy me. Firefox template is regular and can also be changed with customs so easily. Only a few flaws of html, like on Bb's forums .( 3Drealms )   Well, back from school, my mom made me angry right away. Let's hope i do not get disturbed for the next 5 hours, that would be nice. At intervallo i was in  Ana Eloiza 's class, chatting with some girls. I saw that girl named  Amanda , men!   I think i will continue my html lessons now.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Nothing "Really" special today. It started with boringsville as usual, school. I teached " Graisse de baleine " to 3 persons in my school and i will make them compete. So far they are very promising. I was also advised to go to  Skol Beat  at the club this friday, still don't know if i'm going.   Yesterday was kind of Weird, at least at night. I "Somehow" contracted a virus on my pc, i still really don't know where it's from, altought i have an idea. It infected all  my  Java  apps and files plus some files in my  Final Fantasy VII  directory. First sign that i had a virus was that some .exe were dispearing of my hd. Namely my Anti-virus and my telephone software. I was a bit freaked out but i knew what to do. I condamned  Internet Explorer 6.0  and switched for  Mozilla FireFox 0.9 . I also added  Outpost 1.0  firewall and proxy.   Only god know how much i hate virus.    Wanderley  came to my house and we played a bit of stuff. He really liked the  War Of The Ring Demo  and the Snes game  Ninjawarrior .  regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Like my new look? Ok i look like  Enrique Iglesias , just shut the fuck up. I really like it. Bought it from  Locked Street  and it looks really good. i guess a lot of people will laugh at school, it's gonna be cool.    Now i have to study 1 hour per day. My mom's gonna check me. It's not negative or anything, in fact i don't mind.   Got a new feature on my desktop. Some kind of act bar like on  MAC OX . Really neat and useful. I'll post a pic sometime soon.

       urlLink        Went to school, i was so tired and hungry, but it's not like there is food on the table in the morning. When i arrived, decided to make some cleaning in my things before travel. I basically uninstalled all games that i don't play with frequently and i stored all discs in my luggages.   I have one of thoses INCREDIBLE stomachache.   Felt like playing some rpgs so i re-installed  Final Fantasy VII  and  Final Fantasy VIII . I Will restart a new game on VII and try to beat  Fujin and Raijin  in my old VIII game.   Nothing special at the moment. Still a bit shocked by that stuff on  Mikaella .   Well, i'm hungry, gonna check for some stuff.  Regards,  Zephyr

Spoke by mail with the buyer. He was a bit afraid before bidding, but who would not?   Did'nt do anything special except that. I just realised that i play a lot less games than i did in my free time, now i just surf the web. Guess im just waiting for july, am i?   Spoke a bit with  Helder  about my problem, he supports me. It's a good thing to have people supporting you.   Owww i eated too much chocolate after diner.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Yeah, i have to stay on my Mom's  Ebay  Account all day. There is less than 4 hours before the end of the deal, already 6 persons interested! Everyone in my family is pretty certain i will be able to sell it! I'm pretty happy now.   So yesterday, we did'nt go to the movies. Instead we got up the road to piquete and went to a family party at  Wanderley 's Farm. It was nice, and i had to try " The Hot Whine ", god it was so good!   Also,  Paulo  is suppose to meet me here and lend me  Dungeon Siege , looks very promising.   School tommorow. I had a 4 days weekend so it will be hard to return there.

       urlLink       Cool pic huh? The main cover of the game, i think it's pretty. I am going to watch  Van Helsing  again today! Can't wait to be there.   I slept a lot today. All my atempts to get the movie in .avi format where in vain, the user kept disconnecting.   Over and all i had a crappy day. I'm not in my best mood and peoples keep puting me to my limit. May have something to do with my  Gatty  moving even more farther from me. I hate life.   Well, i should be happy and everything about  Canada  and all, but i'm, not at the moment.

       urlLink        Out of the two we wanted to watch, only one was playing, and i'm glad it was  Van Helsing . This movie really is spectacular. Don't listen to what people say about it being a gay non-plot outrage to today's hollywood art. Critics are only good at molesting your brain, violating your mind. At first i tought it would be a flop without taste. I was blown away and my flesh was torn apart in millions of pieces. The action is non-stop, special effects are astounding and i can assure you that the combats are to be remembered. If you don't expect a novel of a story out of this beast, you will be satisfied!   Actually i'm downloading the .avi right now. I will probably go watch it again tommorow. I saw a cute girl at the cinema, also some old friends :  Vinicius Vilena ,  Felipe  and  Julio  from  Drummond School .  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        It works perfectly. Pretty cool, i already played a bit, i love this game. I wish i could try the expansion as well. As you can guess, i am talking about  Age Of Mythology . Graphics are cool, they do not require a high-end pc or anything. It also has all that was cool from  Age Of Empire 2  and a bit of  Warcraft III  (Lucky me!).   So i speaked with  Gabriel  about the  N64  games for my bro. We also planned to go to the movies tonight. It also happen that i was later invited by  Wanderley  to go at the same time, i guess we will go as one group! Pretty cool, can't wait to be there. We have 2 movie choice :  Van Helsing  or  The Day After Tommorow .   Tommorow is gonna be  dungeon and dragon  at my house. Anyone tried  N1.02 ? Send a comment!  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink       Already 12h00Am, woohoo! A quick update before i go to sleep. Ok it's not so new since i got this game for around a month or so. The name of the game is  N . N is a puzzle 2d platformer that takes real elements of physics in order to give a fresh experience. You are in control of a Ninja. Trained for stealth, silence, speed and agility, the Ninja is what you always dreamed to be, except for the 1.5 minutes natural lifespan he possess. Altought he will not live long, the Ninja makes up for it's greed for gold. Each gold piece will add a second to your life timer. The main goal is to exit the level by the door. Altought it look easy, it's a little more complicated. You see, gold is never free and this time it's garded by Ninja-killer-robots.   The game in itself gives access to 30 episodes, each episode is made up of 5 levels. Also, if you know a bit how stuff works, their is the debug mode, a simplified Map Editor (All in the game). It's not as easy as making a  Starcraft  map i'm afraid.In N, your maps are saved as ascii codes, so you need to open a text document and write them down. When you want to load the maps, you need to get your codes on your text document and input them in the game. I made a map, it's fairly easy and extremely cool. So here is the url to grab it.   N version 1.2 (1.3Mo)  ( http://www.harveycartel.org/metanet/downloads.html )  Well, almost done downloading  Age Of Mythology .  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Not much stuff. Talked to  Mikaella  at school wednesday and she was extremely enthusiast about going out friday. Told me several times to call her. I did and after we planned all that stuff, she may be traveling. Anyway friday will be a role play party at my house it looks like. Looking pretty forward to it.   Some extremely bad news on Valentines day (9th June). My girlfriend is going to live even more far away from me. Thats so cool! In fact, no. That makes me angry, a lot .I don't know what to do. A lot of girls interested around me here in lorena, and i have to stay alone.   Installed  Age Of Empire  on my pc and my mother's. I played a lot with simon over  Msn Gaming over at Zone.com . 1 cd is required for 3 players to play, totally awesome. It does not lag much over zone now. I remember the first time i played on zone, it was so retarded. They integrated a lot of msn messenger's features.   Currently listening to the world map music of Final  Fantasy VII  Orchestrated, makes me want to re-install it and start a new game.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Speaked a bit with  Wanderley  at school about my D&D buying project. To explain it briefly, i am trying to sell my  xbox  shrine on the net in order to buy a complete set of Dungeon Master books for  Dungeon And Dragon  play. The books for the latest edition are quite expensive. All informations regarding my Xbox sale can be found on the following Url.   Xbox Set Over Ebay(525$)   ( http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=8110308575 )   Also, played a bit more of  Evilution's Doom II mod . Awesome! Read a lot of stuff about some upcoming events regarding the end of the world as we know it. I'm a bit skeptical, but i leave room for possibilities. We will all know soon enough. I am going to the dentist tommorow...  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Woke up at 10' by  Wanderley  calling me. Took a shower and headed to the  Pao De Leite . Bought some food and joined him along the way. Tried to repair is computer. I believe that the fact he does not update is virus database may have caused him harm. We got back to my house with the japanese. Wanderley introduced me to  Dungeon & Dragon . Totally awesome! I believe i will buy a set to play with my bro and friends when i get in  Canada .   Spoke with  Gatty  and she is sad, also she miss me a lot. I will not be able to travel to her city, it's quite sad. Downloaded  Doom II + Doom legacy + Doom Connector . Now i play Doom in  OpenGl  on the net, totally cool! Looks like  Euphemia  can't wait to see me! Men i feel the same!  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Woke up by my mother, after my shower she told me i could stay home, but i went to school anyway.  Mikaela  had worked hard on her part and i did'nt want to let her down. A 19 pages assignment. I was writing while people watched the film in english class. It was a movie named  Hedwig , about a travesty who fled berlin to usa and formed a band, and got his/her songs ripped. The songs were indeed pretty nice(I'm no fan of Rock And Roll so it's a compliment). Did'nt really like the movie, anyway i had that report to write so...   Downloaded a bit of stuff and found  Microsoft Pinball Arcade . As you can see on the picture, it's well rendered and the physics make it play like real tables. What i love about  that game is that it retraces history of pinball. Each table is a testament to an era of tilt tables. My favourite table is Knockout, but Spirit of 1976 is pretty good as well.   Went to restaurant with my parents today. Don't remember the name of the place. It was a French food restaurant. I had a "Soupe a l'ognion". a "Steak au poivre" and some french fries. everything was great, especially that girl on the other table looking at me...   Gotta go to sleep,  Wanderley  will call me early tommorow. Time is not fast enough, can't wait tosee my friends in Canada!  Regards,  Zephyr

Writed some stuff on tutorialforums.com on the debate forum. Hope to get some intelligent replies.    Wanderley  had a problem with his work. His floppy was corrupted. Everything is fine now.   Feel like playing  chrono cross  with an emu. Reminds me i still have those two 700Mo + images of the game cds.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Had a big urge of checking  Halo II  stuff. Looks REALLY promising. Pretty much everyone mention it has the best first person shooter ever. A bit hyped, but Bungie did a great job with  Halo : Combat Evolved .  O'Donells  instrumental musics in Halo II is as good as ever!   I was suppose to work on the biology project today at home with  Mykaela , but she did'nt came. Well, she was suppose to be here at 2h30, it's 3h28 and still no news. I will work on it a bit later.   Oh! Something really cool as well. I finally got The mp3 of  Grabbag  from  Duke Nukem 3d . No big deal if it was the pc version mp3, but it's the  Nintendo 64  edition we are talking about. AWESOME!  Regards,  Zephyr

We (Me and some other peoples) are working on some new maps to do some amical tournaments on private games. If at least 6 people are in, it will be done. It's gonna be called "Leagues". I worked on some blue prints with  Wanderley  this morning, and we came up with 3 cool maps. I will mod them and compile them after school, and probably publish them on my ftp.   I will also put all the results in assignated posts on this blog. If it works, it's gonna be crazy!  Regards,  Zephyr

        Arrived a few hours ago. A lot of details, i`ll try to make it as short as possible.   Left the appartment yesterday at 4h Pm (Brazilian Time) and arrived at Sao Paulo at 6h30pm. The guys at the ticket station said only 3 of us (Out of six) could fly on Air Canada, the rest would have to cancel the flight or go on American Airflights. My dad decided to take American with 2 of my bros. My mom and my bro went with me on Air Canada.   The trip in plane took something like 10 hours (The first Airplane) and then 1 hour. I was tired when i arrived in Toronto and  even more when we finally landed at Montreal.   I`m on a not-so-good pc with a not-so-good version of windows messenger, so any questions or comments should be forwarded to lucidique@gmail.com   More to come ,believe me, i`m just really tired now.

       urlLink        Today was pretty smooth, i was suppose to travel to  San Jose Dos Campos , but my mom said it would be boring, so i stayed home. Decided to give  Half Life  a quick spin, to remember how much it was a boring game. Did the single player part until that monster in the silo area. Also played a bit of  Specialists 2.0  with custom guns i downloaded yesterday.   Went to the kitchen to have lunch. After eating i watched t.v a bit.(Pretty Rare) 2 awesome movies were playing :  Predator  and  Predator 2 . I watched both of them and went back on the net to check my mails, so nothing special.   Today is my last day connected to the net until i'm back from  Canada . I will probably advise some peoples on  msn  of what is gonna happen. Can't wait to be at the appartment!

       urlLink        Went out a bit to help my mother. We stopped at the resto and after that i went to the movies, alone. I watched  Spider Man 2 , it was the premiere, an incredible movie. We went back home and had diner , pizza was great.   Spoke with some peoples on  msn , played a game of  Homeworld II  and watched that daddy movie with  Adam Sandler , i never remember the title. It sure was an awesome movie as well.   Spoke with  Gustavo  about some girls. Had a talk with  Julien  about what we will do in  Canada , a lot of stuff i hope.   Also visited some new sites, a drawer/painter/photographer named  Beksinski , a true genius as you can see on the pretty picture. I got a link to the author of the music on his websites. The guy name is  Zbigniew Preisner . The kind of music like i have never seen. Well actually i think i did, some kind of instrumental music, but in a sad way. I love it.   Well, i'm tired to death and my father will upgrade internet! Better get some sleep now.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Looks good? Well i'd like to have one right now. Damn i'm so hungry for some real food! Nothing special happened today, boredom as usual. Oh yeah, when i played my last game of  Homeworld II , i was listening to  Valhalla  from the  Valkyrie Profile  arranged album, and the music fitted perfect with my fight scene. Awesome!   Actionplant  forums seems to be working properly now, last time i tried to log on i had problems. The new skins are awesome, i did myself a new avatar and a new sig for the occasion.   2 weeks before the launch of  Tutorial Central , well it's not the official name anymore but it's still gonna be awesome.   Well i guess i'm off to finish my game of Homeworld II.  Regards,  Zephyr

       urlLink        Sweet? A picture of the new cgi video from the  Final Fantasy XII  official website. It looks good and will probably be good.   Woke up at 10ham with an incredible headache, also i did a nightmare i don't fully remember, it involved something like being trapped, anyway i am the champion of nightmares that makes no sense.   Played a bit more of  Homeworld II  Demo, fucked my game completely because i somehow activated an unknown feature of the game (Well, it's not in the tutorial), that was the waypoint mode. I will probably try to master it later on.    Julien  is angry at is parents because they control is money, well the money he wins when he works.   Nothing else to say i guess, except 6 days! The furnitures that were suppose to arrive today appearently didn't, who know why?  Regards,  Zephyr
