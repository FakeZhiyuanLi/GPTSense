      Now, I've only been watching racing closely since the start of this season. All throughout my life though, my grandfather has been a big fan, so I've been around it enough to know most of the legendary names and some not-so-legendary ones from the late 80s/early 90s.   Jimmie Johnson's performance in last night's Coca-Cola 600 was by far the most dominating performance I've seen. Like I said, that's not saying much, but from what I've read, that was the type of race that you don't see too often.  Johnson was fast at the beginning of the race, fast in the middle of the race, and fast at the end. New tires, old tires - didn't seem to matter all that much. Despite a rash of cautions and subsequent restarts in the last 75 laps or so, Johnson kept pulling away from the field. It was like he was shot out of a cannon each time.   I came away quite impressed. And it seems that a lot more people, who are a lot more NASCAR-savvy, agree.

      Yeah, I know, this is a day later than usual. No - I haven't been sulking or trying to avoid having to mention this. It's been a busy Memorial Day weekend for me, and this is actually my first time with a chance to do some writing.  Game 3 was pretty intense, complete with star forwards Vinny Lecavalier and Jarome Iginila battling in a 1st period fight. After a great scoring chance for Brad Richards on a short-handed breakaway in the 2nd, the Flames' Chris Simon was able to push a rebound home to score the first goal of the game. Less than 2 minutes later, the 2nd goal went in, and the Lightning found themselves in a big hole. The Flames were able to clamp down defensively, much like they did in Game 1, and took a 2-1 lead in the series.   There's really not that much to say about it. I thought both teams looked pretty even before the scoring began, and the bounces seemed to go Calgary's way, and they pulled out the victory. Tonight's Game 4 is critical for the Bolts, because it's pretty hard to beat any team three games in a row. let alone a scrappy, resilient team like the Flames.  On a sidenote, I went to a party Saturday night, and I got my first experience of sports in HD, watching the game there. A couple of points:  - The picture was impressively sharp. However, I don't see this as being the revolution that I've heard so many people call it. I do love the widescreen, but again, it's not something I can't live without. Is the picture better than a non-HD tv? Yeah, but in my opinion, it isn't so much better that it was worth the $8-9 grand that people were spending to upgrade to it a couple of years ago. I'll wait a couple years for prices to come down and more programming to become accessible before I even consider lobbying to my wife for the upgrade.  - I've also read many a columnist proclaim that HD will save hockey on TV. Well, I don't see that either. Yeah, you get a little more of the playing surface onscreen, but that's about it. And it's really not even that much extra. Maybe an extra 3-4 feet of ice on each side. Big deal. The extra clarity of the picture isn't adding anymore to hockey than it would any other sport, movie, TV show, etc. Nothing makes it easier to follow the puck (the #1 complaint about TV hockey, from what I've seen), or see the plays develop better. You still miss the checks behind the action - not even the widescreen is wide enough to catch all of those. If the NHL is counting on HD to save its ridiculously miniscule ratings, then I think it's in for a big surprise.

      Following up on my promise last week, I fully intend to make this a weekly feature...  It's Memorial Day weekend, the unofficial start to summer, and the sports calendar is filling up. Tonight's schedule is fairly light (as Friday nights usually are), but I will once again plug TBS' Friday Night Xtra. Last week's guest Dale Murphy did a fine job in the booth, but this week TBS welcomes a former icon for the Braves' host this weekend - Philly slugger Greg Luzinski. With the Bull in the booth, and a highly anticpated matchup on the field, this is definitely a game worth watching for baseball fans.  The NBA Playoffs continue tonight as well, with Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals on ESPN. I actually was keeping an eye on Game 3 Wednesday night while I was out, and that first half was painful to watch. I was quickly reminded why I don't follow the NBA too closely anymore. Does anyone actually think either of these teams could beat the Lakers? Well, needless to say, I don't consider this prime viewing unless you're a glutton for punishment.  Saturday will give you plenty of choices for viewing, depending on your sports of choice. FOX has Saturday baseball, which means the Braves-Phillies on a different network (wow, so glad to have this regional coverage - someone please remind the FOX folks that we can all see our regional teams every day anyway).   With the weekend, NBC takes over coverage of the French Open, which means tape-delayed action (get excited)! I just don't get it - will that many more people watch taped coverage at noon than watch live coverage beginning at 9:00? I'll probably just check the internet to find out who won, and watch the baseball game instead.  Saturday night, it's a choice between Game 5 of the Lakers-T'Wolves series on TNT, or Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Finals on ABC. I'm betting that NBA game will be interesting, because the league really needs to get as many games out of the Lakers as they can right now - they are keeping the ratings afloat. My hunch is that Minnesota wins Game 5 and at least sends gives TNT one more game. Meanwhile, the NHL heads north to Canada for Game 3, and after last night, this series is definitely up for grabs.  Sunday will have plenty to offer. The day begins early, French Open coverage at 11:00 on NBC (they may actually have a chance to show some live coverage, but I wouldn't count on it). Over on ABC, the green flag at the Indy 500 drops at noon ET, kicking off the marathon day of auto racing.  There's also the usual baseball games Sunday afternoon, as well as golf. The PGA guys are in Memphis for the FedEx St. Jude, but it's a pretty weak field again. If John Daly's in contention, maybe it's worth a look, but otherwise I'll pass. The Seniors are in Louisville for the Senior PGA Championship, so there could be some interesting happenings on NBC.  After a short break, get ready for Sunday night. FOX kicks things off with the Coca-Cola 600 at 5 pm. NASCAR's longest race will be racing well into the night, hopefully without any weather delays that have popped up frequently over the past several years.  There's also Game 5 of the Pacers-Pistons series at 8:00 on ESPN, as well as Sunday Night Baseball (Dodgers-Diamondbacks) on ESPN2.  There you have it, sports fans - the highlights of this weekend's action on the tube. I'll be trying my best to spread my viewing out, but to me the only can't-miss action is the Coke 600. This is one of NASCAR's best races each year, and was the first race I ever watched from start to finish. That was in 1995, and I've been hooked on the sport since. For that, it gets my pick of the weekend.

      The Lightning proved once again that they are capable of bouncing back like an experienced, mature team, moving to 5-0 after loss in the 2004 playoffs. Despite a sluggish start to the Stanley Cup Finals, the Tampa Bay Lightning played an inspired Game 2, evening the series at one game apiece.   The difference between the first two games is that the Lightning came out energetic and inspired from the very beginning.  urlLink C Vinny Lecavalier  played a ferocious 1st period, throwing checks and spectacularly assisting on the first goal. On that assist, Vinny was being pursued behind the net by a Calgary skater. He purposely bounced the puck off the back of the net to pass it to himself, did a sharp 360, recovered the puck while the Calgary player flew out of the play, passed it back out into open ice, and shortly thereafter, Ruslan Fedotenko shuffled the puck in off of a rebound.  The 1st period was also characterized by a flurry of penalties, many of which were questionable at best. Dmitry Afanasenkov was called for boarding, when his momentum carried him into a Flame that touched up an icing call. Minutes later, a Calgary player did the same thing to a Lightning player touching up - no call.   But in all reality, it seemed that those penalites helped the Bolts. Calgary had a total of 4 power plays in the 1st period, but were unable to even come close to converting one of them into a goal. The Lightning penalty kill continues its brilliant play throughout the playoffs. And I think it swung momentum into Tampa Bay's favor. The Flames could get nothing going, and that's deflating, while the Lightning and the crowd were getting more and more confidence as each penalty expired.  By not falling behind early, the Lightning were able to keep Calgary from pinching down hard on defense. In fact, as the 3rd period rolled around, the Flames had to put more effort into scoring the equalizer, which helped open up the ice for the Bolts, resulting in 3 3rd period goals.   The series shifts to Calgary Saturday night, where the Flames haven't been spectacular. They're only 4-5 at home so far, while the Lightning have gone 5-2 on the road. It should be a wild atmosphere, being the first Stanley Cup Finals game in Canada since 1993. It should be a great game, one that may set the tone for the rest of the series.

      It used to be that the mention of Memorial Day weekend in the sports world brought visions of one thing: The Brickyard. But as we approach the unofficial kickoff to summer, there's been hardly a peep about this year's Indianapolis 500. Despite the fact that the IRL has pretty much killed off the rival CART series for good, the open-wheel set has fallen far, far behind stock car racing on the American sports scene. There are no real "stars" on the IRL series anymore - the best racers now migrate to NASCAR or even Formula 1 when the opportunity arises, and the fans have followed (at least to NASCAR).  This Sunday will once again be the biggest day of the year in auto racing, but it's the Coca-Cola 600 that will likely steal the show. NASCAR's longest race, held on the "home" track for most of its teams, has become one of the biggest race events of the year. It will probably never achieve the fame of Indy or Daytona, but the 600 will likely be watched by a similar number of people thanks to its cushy time slot on Sunday evening before the Monday holiday.  As for Indy, it will be noted in the Monday papers who this year's winner was, but within a week the IRL will again be forgotten. Race fans will once again be back at NASCAR, which will bring its brand of racing to the hallowed grounds at Indy later this summer. In fact, Indianapolis will once again continue as the premier racing facility in the world, thanks to its hosting of the Formula 1 US Grand Prix in June.   With such a schedule, Indianapolis Motor Speedway is the only place in the world to host events from the biggest three series in racing. Of course, many people would probably disagree with that statement now - they would say that Indy hosts races from the two biggest series, along with another race that originally made the place famous.

      The NBA Lottery was held last night. A few notes:  1) Why do they always hold this during the conference finals? I've never understood this. Let's give NBA fans something to think about and speculate on while four teams battle it out for a place in the Finals. Granted, you can't push the lottery back till after the Finals, because the draft is just a couple weeks after that. But why not put it on during the 1st round of the playoffs? You've still got 16 sets of teams' fans interested in the playoffs then, and you give the other 14 teams' fans something to talk about as well. It just seems so counterproductive to take the spotlight off of the teams that are still in it, and put it on the dregs of the league, and in the case of the Clippers, the dregs of all of American sport.   2) Did the Magic really 'win' anything? I'd hate to have the 1st pick in the NBA these days. The yearly high school exodus has made it a very tenuous position. High school players are such risks. You've never seen them against college-caliber talent, let alone professional-caliber talent. You could be getting an  urlLink Amare Stoudemire , or maybe a  urlLink Kwame Brown .  Think about some of the other stud high school players to come out pre-Garnett. Remember  urlLink Felipe Lopez ? The all-world guard who would resurrect St. John's basketball program? With all the hype surrounding him, he probably would have been no worse than a lottery pick, very likely in the top 5 or 6, in today's current atmosphere. But what happened between then and now? Lopez was a good, but not spectacular college player. He was a late-1st Rd pick, bounced around with the Grizzlies, Wizards, and T-Wolves, hasn't been in the league since 2002, and has a career scoring avg of 5.8 in 249 games. Not exactly worth the investment required.   3) The 'experts' are calling this a very weak draft, on the heels of a very strong one in 2003. Magic fans and media expecting another LeBron James or Carmelo Anthony are going to be disappointed. And that, my friends, is when heads start to roll. Going with the safe pick, they could get Emeka Okafor, who reminds me of Ben Wallace with a just a little bit more offense. Then, you run the risk of passing on a Garnett or Jermaine O'Neal-type who needed the time to develop. Or they can turn to a high school player, none of whom are going to be ready to provide a LeBron/Carmelo-type impact, and could very well turn into another Eddy Curry.   If I'm in the Orlando Magic front office, I'm on the horn trying desperatley to trade this pick. It's worth more to another GM who is willing to take these risks. And I'm not one who would.

      The city famed for its fortified aged wine has something to celebrate tonight, as FC Porto added the Champions League trophy to their collection.  The Portuguese champions' 3-0 defeat of Monaco completed the rare feat of winning the UEFA Cup (Europe's #2 competition) in one year and following it up with the Champions League title the next.  Porto took down Monaco with the same tactical skills that felled giants like Manchester United in earlier rounds. The constantly baited Monaco into their offsides trap, held stoutly in defense, and carefully chose their moments for attack.   After a somewhat slow start, Porto broke through with a goal minutes before the end of the first half. With the lead, they were now free to pack in the back and make life miserable for Fernado Morientes and the rest of Monaco's attack.  Moments after a failed Monaco corner midway through the second half, Porto broke out on a counterattack that was executed to perfection. Breaking from their own half, Porto skillfully played the ball from the inside to the flank, then back across where Deco calmly settled, then fired a shot into the back of the net. It was 2-0, and pretty much over. The Portuguese side would add a 3rd goal moments later for the final margin.  For Portuguese fans, this is likely a sweet moment - their nation is preparing to host the European Championship next month, and they will hope that the triumph by their club champion can be followed by a similar performance from a national side that has teased but disappointed on an international stage over the past several years. With many of those national players now owning the medals of Europe's club championship, that is entirely possible.

       Good news for fellow Cub fans. Looks like Mark Prior isn't having any setbacks. If he does make that start Sunday at Iowa, it might be his last on the rehab assignment. He's eligible to come off the 60-day DL June 3rd, and he could start against the Pirates in that weekend series. It's great timing, with Wood down for another couple of weeks.   While there's not much good about having your franchise pitcher out with an injury, maybe the silver lining is the reduced fatigue on Prior's arm. I'm not the first one to suggest this, but perhaps Prior will benefit by not having as many tiresome innings by the time September and, hopefully, October roll around. We've all seen how Dusty Baker likes to ride his starting pitchers' arms.

       Calgary came into the St. Pete Times Forum for Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals, fresh and chased down puck after puck, creating turnovers and scoring opportunities. They killed penalties efficiently, and even set up multiple shorthanded breakaways including a backbreaking short-handed goal in the 2nd period.  Sounds familiar to Lightning fans, eh?  These two teams play a very similar style of hockey. They capitalize on forechecking. They rely on transition scoring opportunities. They have tons of speed.  And when you get two good teams who play similar styles in any sport, the team that works harder usually wins. And that's what happened. There's no other way to say it - the Lightning got flat outhustled last night.   Luckily, the Lightning did show flashes of brilliance, getting several prime chances, but Calgary G Miikka Kiprusoff was on his game, keeping all but one of those out of the net.  The Bolts didn't look like they were ready for the defensive pressure that Calgary brought to the table. G Nikolai Khabibulin misplayed several pucks behind the net with Calgary skaters streaking in towards him. He was very lucky to have not given up another goal on some of those.  Obviously, Game 1 was a letdown for Tampa Bay, but a lot of people expected it after a very emotional and hardfought Game 7 with the Flyers. Let's see if they can come out with more energy Thursday night before we start making judgements. Thus far in the playoffs, they've been able to follow a disappointing outing with a focued, inspired one. So Game 2 will be the proverbial litmus test. I think John Tortorella will make sure he gets this team back on track.

      Tomorrow, one of the biggest games of the year takes place, but it will receive little more than a quick moment on SportsCenter. Across the Atlantic, Europe's equivalent of the Super Bowl will be contested in the city of Gelsinkirchen, Germany (home of German soccer club Schalke 04).  The UEFA Champions League final is the ultimate match in European club soccer, and throughout the continent life will stand still for two hours, beginning at 8:45 CET (2:45 pm here in the Eastern time zone of the US). FC Porto and AS Monaco will battle to determine who is the best team in all of Europe, a tremendous honor. While getting to the Super Bowl requires grinding through 16 regular season games to be one of the top 12 teams out of 30, then winning two or three playoff games, getting to the Champions League final requires much, much more.  First, these two sides had to qualify for this year's event by placing near the top of their national leagues in 2002-2003 (that usually means being #1 or #2 in a league of 18). Then, these sides had to navigate a six-match round robin phase against other top sides, followed by three home-and-away series against the other top survivors. What makes this year's finalists so amazing is that neither one was expected to be anywhere near here - despite being from two top soccer-playing nations, these are upper-tier teams from mid-level leagues.   What Monaco and Porto have done is take down the larger, wealthier, more famous clubs in Europe with a brand of soccer that's not always entertaining, but is the embodiment of teamwork. They are the two survivors from a competition that essentially stretched over two years and involved hundreds of teams. Tomorrow, one of them will be rewarded with a place in history.  I know most people don't have the opportunity to watch TV on weekday afternoons, but I'd urge those that do to take this opportunity to see what much of the world considers their biggest annual match. I won't get quite the experience I had last year, when I got to watch the final from an Irish Pub in the city of Lyon, France, along with a roaring crowd of mainly Italians (two Italian sides actually met in the last year's game). Regardless, I'll be watching from work, anxious to see what happens in Europe's Big One.

      One of the perks of my job is that we have TV's in the office, so that means I am able to catch daytime sporting events quite often. A few minutes ago, I flipped over to ESPN2's French Open coverage to see the latest from Paris, and to my dismay I saw Venus Williams. As is customary in the opening round of the women's draw at a Grand Slam, Venus was facing a vastly inferior opponent and already up early in the match - not the most riveting television.   Now here's the kicker: Not only is ESPN choosing to show us this slaughter, but it's not even live! I already know that Venus ran past Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-2, 6-4, because I have internet access. I also know that Tommy Haas has taken the first set from defending champ Juan Carlos Ferrero in the best match of the opening round. That match is going on right now (check the link for all the lives scores), but ESPN apparently thinks we'd rather see Venus' earlier romp over the top women's player from Thailand.   I know that Americans will root for American athletes, and we need American stars for the sport to be popular here. But in this day and age, showing taped coverage instead of live coverage is just plain stupid, especially when it's not even a worthy match. Hopefully ESPN will eventually listen to all the complaints from tennis fans, and give us some matches worth watching. Here's a helpful hint to the guys in Bristol - check out the new Tennis Channel during non-Grand Slam events and you'll see the coverage we want

        I didn't watch the Pistons-Pacers game last night, but I saw the highlights, specifically the bigtime block that Tayshaun Prince got on what would have been a game-tying layup for Reggie Miller. Miller's post-game quote: "I saw him in my rearview mirror. In hindsight, I should have dunked it, but I thought I had a few steps on him."   Couple of points on this:  1) How ironic is it that he 'should have' dunked it? How many times do you see someone blow a dunk and you think to yourself, "Man, he shoulda just layed it up." Happens to me all the time. Last night, Reggie went for the layup and he says he should have dunked it. Which brings me to my next point....  2) Can Reggie Miller even dunk anymore? He was never much of a leaper, and he's 38 now. Although I can't remember ever seeing him do it, I'm sure he could back in the Spike Wars days. I dunno, I haven't watched enough NBA over the last 4-5 years, but it just doesn't sound right. And if he can dunk nowadays, I gotta think it still isn't easy for him - otherwise he would have done it without thinking last night. So, if he has trouble getting above the rim, then I still think the layup is the right shot, because it'd be much worse if he clanged it. With the layup, he at least forced Prince to make a pretty athletic play.

      That's the official attendance number from Montreal last night, where the Braves shut out the Expos. Of the many, many reasons I despise Bud Selig, his handling of the Expos has truly been an embarrassment for baseball. This franchise has now sunk to its lowest lows (no real home, no fans, and a truly horrendous team on the field). MLB execs promise that we will get an offical announcement on the team's ultimate destination by July, but is there any reason I should believe them at this point? I truly hope they are telling the truth this time, because what we are seeing right now in Montreal both in the stands and on the field is truly shameful.

      Not good news today... Kerry Wood will miss at least another 3 weeks after feeling discomfort again yesterday.   It's actually pretty impressive what the Cubs have been able to do with all of the injuries they've suffered. The Angels have gotten a lot of attention for what they've been able to do, despite a glut of injuries. But take note of the Cubs' woes. There's Wood, Mark Prior hasn't pitched, Sammy Sosa sneezed his back out of whack, and Mark Grudzielanek, Alex Gonzalez, Mike Remlinger, and Kent Mercker have all hit the DL. And yet, the Cubs took 2 of 3 in a weekend series with the Cardinals to remain in a tie for 1st place in the NL Central. Who woulda thunk it?  Now, Lee can attest to my preseason prediction of the Wild Card for the Cubs, with the Astros winning the division. But if they can keep up this pace without their stars, then I may have underestimated them (happily). Wood, Prior, and Sosa should all be back by mid-June, just in time for the stretch run.

      It looks like the Raiders are less than sure that QB Rich Gannon is going to be as effective as he was in 2002. As they close in on signing Kerry Collins to a contract, there's a very good possibility that they will let Gannon, who has already refused to take a pay cut, go.  So, with a questionable shoulder and no guarantee that his skills haven't eroded a great deal, the 2002 MVP will be forced to look for a new team. Former coach Jon Gruden and the Buccaneers are sure to be first on his list. And Gruden and Bruce Allen will actually consider it, and might even go ahead and do it.  Gannon and Gruden are cut from the same mold. Gruden has never had a quarterback understand his offense as well as Gannon. Gannon has never had a coach who used his talents more successfully. They're both workaholics and have keen attention to detail in their exhaustive preparations.   Memo to Jon Gruden: You've already got a pretty good quarterback. His name is Brad Johnson. All he's done since he got to the Bucs is average 3,400 passing yds per season and help win a Super Bowl. You spent all of last year praising Johnson, telling everyone on the record that he's your guy.   Despite all of the public rhetoric to the opposite, there has to be something to this lack of cohesion between Gruden and Johnson. There have been far too many whispers and rumors regarding their relationship for none of it to be unfounded. The reality is, though, that Johnson has been a pretty decent quarterback. Plus, he doesn't have Gannon's bum shoulder.  So what gives? Does anybody really think that Gruden would bring Gannon in as a backup, especially after already signing Brian Griese earlier in the offseason? Does anybody think that Gannon would sign if he knew he was gonna be a backup?   Gruden is known for wanting to sign any player that comes along on the waiver wire. It's what drove Rich McKay out of town, but this is ridiculous. Here's to hoping that Gruden and Allen show a little restraint.  (Note: I don't plan on everything I write for this site to be based on Tampa-area teams. I promise to work on some less Florida-centric stuff soon.)

      Well, it's just after 10 am in the East on the first day of the French Open, and already the most popular American men's player is gone. Andre Agassi has stumbled out of Paris way too quickly, and now the questions will certainly be coming. Is Andre about to join his old friend/rival Pete Sampras in retirement?   I was always a Sampras guy, but I do admire Andre for the way he has resurrected his career not once, but twice. He's carried on at the top of the tennis world far longer than anyone else in recent history (by 34, most top players have long since faded into oblivion, whether retired or hanging on as a shell of their former selves). But Andre has been here still, helping carry the tennis torch in the US until Andy Roddick and the next generation of players could step up. Roddick has so far (hopefully he can beat one of Agassi's peers, Todd Martin, in their opener later today), but no one else has yet.   Tennis is probably the most popular "international" sport in the US. However, it needs strong American talent to keep it that way and Andre has been that talent in the men's game for many, many years. I'm afraid that today's defeat may be the sign that Andre's days as a top-10 player are winding down, but hopefully he still has one last great run at Flushing Meadows ready for this September - it would be a final treat for the legions of fans that have followed the highs and lows of one of tennis' most memorable careers.

      You better believe that I was glued to the TV Saturday night for Game 7 between the Lightning and Flyers. It was a great game and the Bolts prevailed, so I'm not at all disappointed with it. Both teams gave everything they had, and it was a nail-biting experience.   The Lightning gained redemption after their collapse in Game 6. If you'll recall in that game, the Lightning entered the 3rd period with a one-goal lead. But they played not to lose by being content to dump the puck deep into the Philadelphia zone and never try to keep possession of it nor attack the net. Yep, Tampa Bay had mostly controlled the action in the first two periods, and now they were going to sit on a lead, a  one-goal  lead. And that strategy worked - for eighteen and a half minutes. The Flyers, after getting a steady stream of scoring opportunities throughout the period, finally got a puck in the net with 98 seconds left in the game. The hometown crowd went nuts, and the Flyers carried that momentum into the overtime period, dominated it like they did the 3rd period and scored to force a Game 7.   So, fast forward to Saturday night, and guess what - the Lightning enter the 3rd period with a very vulnerable one-goal lead. The Flyers have their backs against the wall once again. The Lightning coaches and players claimed they'd learned their lesson from Game 6 and wouldn't get away from their style of play if they had a late lead. And they didn't. In the 3rd period, the Lightning did exactly what they were supposed to do - they turned up the heat on the Flyers. They got more physical, checking with more ferocity. They pushed the puck into their offensive zone, getting more shots on goal than their opponents in the 3rd. They didn't let the Flyers tee off on G Nikolai Khabibulin, fighting ferociously to dig the puck out of the corner and get an odd-man rush going.   They played like a team on a mission.   One more thing. You gotta feel good for a guy like  urlLink Dave Andreychuk . 22 years in the league, 634 goals, 1,320 points. And he's getting his first chance to play for the Stanley Cup. And the refreshing thing is that he refuses to make this a personal triumph. Whenever anyone has asked him about it, he always brushes it aside and reiterates that the team as a whole has earned the accomplishment through their hard work. He also makes sure to note that the ultimate goal hasn't been accomplished yet.   And believe me, he won't let the other guys on the team forget it. I've never been a big believer in the extreme importance of 'chemistry' for a championship team. But having a guy like Dave Andreychuk has been good for the Bolts. He's taught the younger guys, like Vinny Lecavlier and Brad Richards, what it takes to win night in and night out. And he's been a strong, vocal leader - John Tortorella's own coach out on the ice. While he'll never admit it, he means a lot more to this team than his statistics will imply.   Dave, this couldn't happen to a more deserving player. Good luck in the Finals.

      You could say that I'm a hockey newbie. Living in Florida my entire life, I can obviously attest to not being around a lot of hockey.   I really started watching it during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. With real-life All-Star teams made up of players that actually tried to win (unlike typical all-star games), I got wrapped up in it. I got a chance to learn the game a little then, and since then, I've learned a lot more, like different strategies and the like.   The NHL Playoffs are great fun. They're really gripping and intense. And with my hometown Tampa Bay Lightning in the Eastern Conference Finals, you could say I'm a little 'Cup Crazy' right now. The Bolts and Philadelphia Flyers played Game 6 of that series last night, with the Flyers winning in OT to force a Saturday Game 7 in Tampa.   Now, if you've never watched playoff hockey before, to say that the referees are really lax late in games would be a gross understatement. During last night's overtime, anarchy was the theme. A cross-check here - no whistle. Somebody gets tripped there - no whistle. Little slashing everywhere - guess what, no whistle. The players knew there would be no repercussions, and they took advantage of that.  Both teams were guilty of the infractions, but as a fan of sports in general, I just don't know how this has become acceptable officiating. Everytime a player would get possession of the puck, and a little steam built up, next thing you know he's basically tackled from behind. If that happens in a regular season game, it's two minutes in the box. But not in the playoffs.  Look, I understand that you never want a referee's call to decide the outcome of a game. But is that really worse than a game of rugby breaking out on the ice? Why should a game be called differently in different circumstances? It's the equivalent of football officials telling the players, "We're only gonna call offsides for the rest of the game, guys. Everything else goes." Could you imagine that? Every wide receiver would get laid out before the quarterback gets to step #2 in a 5-step drop. What about basketball? If there's a 2-on-1 fast break, the lone defender needs to just clothesline the ballhandler. Would fans accept that? Would the players?  But in hockey, its anything goes. Look, if you need to hook a guy like Jaromir Jagr to keep the game-winning goal from scoring, then by all means do it. But you should also pay the price for that. And if you can hold on during that power play, then it was a good decision. But if you can't, then that's the risk you take.  A ref making a call isn't what's determining the outcome of the game. The player's decision to commit the offense is.   The NHL needs to re-examine the way their officials are enforcing the rules in these games, and require them to follow the rulebook no matter what period it is. It makes for a more exciting and more tactical game. They owe it to the fans.

      Since it's late Friday afternoon, I thought I'd give a rundown of some of what I'll be watching this weekend. Maybe we'll make this a weekly feature.  Tonight, I'll be watching the Braves-Dodgers game on TBS. I could go to the game, but I actually would prefer to watch this one on TV. If you haven't watched TBS for a Friday night game yet, check it out - they're doing some pretty neat stuff (and some not so neat) for their "Braves Friday Night Xtra." Well, tonight's highlight for me will be guest commentator Dale Murphy, former Brave great. Murph was my favorite player growing up, and remains I guy I really admire. He's losing steam on the Hall of Fame ballot, which is a shame, because he's exactly the type of great character guy the Hall supposedly honors. Anyway, Murph's a whole story for another day, so I'll save it for then.  There's also NBA action tonight, with Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers have advanced to play the Timberwolves, led by MVP Kevin Garnett. Think the NBA and their broadcast partners were relieved at that matchup? The East will be a snoozer, but at least they will get some viewers for this series. I'm not really an NBA guy though, so I probably won't watch too much. But it's there for all you NBA fans who have somehow persevered through the slowest early rounds in the history of pro sports playoffs.  Tomorrow, FOX returns with the Saturday Game of the Week. My question is why do they wait until mid-May to do this? What have they been showing on Saturday afternoons for the past six weeks? On the plus side, it's six weeks that I haven't had to listen to Tim McCarver's idiodic commentary. Also, it's not really like it's that big of a thing for me - it just means that the Braves are on a different channel, because that's the game they will be showing. You know, most of the country already sees the Braves (and Cubs and Yankees as well) on a regular basis, so how about finding some different teams to show us, FOX?  Tomorrow night, it will be over to FX for the NASCAR Nextel All-Star Challenge. This is usually a pretty fun event, and you never know what's gonna happen (like two years ago, when a rain storm came just after the first wreck of the race and NASCAR decided to let the guys who wrecked get their cars fixed during the delay). It's also much shorter than the typical NASCAR race and full of action, so it's a great chance for non-NASCAR fans to check the sport out and see how it can be quite interesting. I highly recommend it.  There's also a hockey Game 7 tomorrow night. John I'm sure will be trying his best to watch his Lightning finish off the Flyers along with NASCAR. I'll let him discuss this more though if he wants, because I'm not really a hockey guy either.  NBA fans can again check out playoff action tomorrow night, with Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. But I'd have to guess you'd be a pretty hard-core fan to be looking forward to watching Detroit and Indiana slug it out. At least the West has some intruiging teams.  Sunday looks like a pretty slow day. Whatever happened to Sunday afternoons chock full of sports? Even the lone NBA playoff game of the day doesn't tip until 8:30. By then, it will be almost time for me to watch the Sopranos. Thankfully, things are really about to crank up for the big summertime events (Tennis and Golf are about to enter their summer run of majors, beginning with the French Open on Monday).  So what does Sunday afternoon offer? Well, there's baseball again (Braves-Dodgers on TBS), the final round of the PGA Colonial (no Tiger, no Vijay, no Ernie, no Phil, not much interest), and that's about it. How can Sunday afternoon be so empty? Guys, get some points by doing something productive Sunday afternoon, because you won't have many more weekend afternoons this barren on the sporting scene.  Well, that's about it for the weekend, sports fans. Like I said, we can all look forward to next week, as the French Open begins on Monday, the Stanley Cup Finals start Tuesday, and the NBA and MLB plug along. Oh, and one of Europe's biggest days on the sporting calendar is next week as well: the Champions League final, with Porto facing Monaco. More on all that next week.

      I'm Lee Geeker, co-author here with John. A native Floridian, I now live in Atlanta, GA. I'll go ahead and let you know that I'll likely be specializing in content pertaining to football (college), baseball, and NASCAR, as well as less publicized sports like soccer and tennis. Really though, I could pretty much come up with stuff on anything. Now let's get this show started...

      In less than an hour, Portugal and the Netherlands will face off in the Euro 2004 semifinals. When the match is over one of these two nations will be on their way to the finals and will have pretty much shed the label of perrenial underachiever, which has been placed on both sides over the past decade.  The Dutch have won one European title (in 1988), but have consistently been labeled as one of the most talented international sides for the past 30 years. The faces constantly change, but there is always a new wave of talented youngsters ready to step up. Unfortunately, major international tournaments always seem to end in disappointment, including the 2000 tournament where the Dutch served as hosts.  Now, the Oranje will try to end the run of this year's tournament hosts, a side that boasts one of the biggest stars in the game in Luis Figo. Figo is one of several Portuguese players who were dubbed the "Golden Generation" when they won the FIFA Youth title several years ago. Unfortunately, despite all of the professional success of these players, they have yet to break through in international play. Now, with Figo and the others on the wrong side of 30, this is their final chance to prove how special their talents really are.  It's unfair to think that one team will be praised while the other is stuck with the underachiever label based solely on the outcome of one game, and perhaps just one goal. But that's the way it works sometimes in international soccer. Today, someone will step up and carry his country forward to the promised land - it should be fantastic to watch.

      When the Orioles played an exhibition series in Havana against the Cuban National Team a few years ago, I made a comment that startled my friends. During the game, ESPN cut to a shot of Bud Selig sitting with Fidel Castro and I remarked that if I were an assassin at that game, I'd shoot Bud and not Castro.  Now, I have softened on a few things Selig has done during his rule of baseball (ok, so maybe the wild cards were a good idea), but for the most part I still believe that the reign of Selig has been bad for baseball and that the man himself is a fast-talking con artist (not surprising for a guy who made his money as a car salesman).  Finally, someone has presented an in-depth portrait of some of Selig's doings over the past ten years or so, and it pretty much reaffirms my feelings on the man who runs baseball like a dictator.  I encourage any baseball fan to read this Washington Post series that details why the DC area may not get a Major League team anytime soon, and why they actually may not want one, given the conditions that will be imposed by his highness the Commissioner. (Note that free registration to the Post site is required to read - sorry about that).

      Just a few weeks ago it took plenty of effort to find Americans playing into the second week at the French Open, but the fortunes of the US contingent have changed dramatically thus far at Wimbledon.  Despite the upset defeat suffered by Venus Williams last week, American players on both sides fared quite well through the early rounds at the All-England club. On the men's side Andy Roddick has now been left to carry the flag, but compatriots Vince Spadea and Robby Ginepri both reached the fourth round before falling on Monday.  On the women's side, Serena Williams hasn't had the struggles of her sister and has to be considered the odds-on favorite to win another Wimbledon title. Wednesday however she will have to once again face off against Jennifer Capriati, who is looking for her first Wimbledon title. Along with those two, Lindsay Davenport has played as well as anyone and will be favored to defeat teen sensation Maria Sharapova in the semifinals. If that happens, there is a great chance of an all-American women's final.  Regardless, after all of the worry about the state of American tennis during the two weeks in Paris, the fortnight in England has shown that there are still plenty of solid American players in both competitions, and with the summer North American swing about to begin, these players will return home ready to show their own fans what they are capable of. If all goes well, it could be a fun summer for US tennis fans.

      I guess when you sign a contract to play professional sports in America, you've signed your life away. Hell, these days, you don't even have to sign the contract, as long as the team owns your rights.  Emeka Okafor was invited, and accepted, to become the 12th and final member of the 2004 USA men's basketball team. However, this doesn't sit too well with Charlotte Bobcats GM and coach Bernie Bickerstaff, who selected Okafor with the 2nd selection in last week's NBA Draft. Here are his thoughts:   We are somewhat concerned because all that basketball causes a lot of wear and tear and prevents you from being fresh at the start of the season. We have many concerns that we want to address.  OK, I understand that management is wary of Okafor wearing himself out, but let's be realistic here. Bickerstaff says that he'd rather Okafor work out with the coaching staff in Charlotte and play in summer league games. Well, will there really be any more basketball played by the Olympic team than by the proposed summer league games and workout schedule the Bobcats have planned for Okafor? If there is more, it's because Team USA will probably practice together a play a couple of exhibition games in the weeks leading up to the tournament. Besides, it doesn't matter what he does this offseason - Okafor will hit the wall regardless. And Okafor will be the most-rested player on the team. As of now, he hasn't played competitive basketball for almost 3 months.   Of course, in Bickerstaff's eyes, it'd be more beneficial for Okafor to work out and scrimmage with the castoffs that make up the expansion Bobcats roster, instead of working out with the best player in the NBA (Tim Duncan) and a group of All-Star-caliber players. Well, that's just plain ridiculous. I can't think of a better way to help your franchise player to adjust to the NBA than to have him post up and guard Duncan in practice. If I'm Bickerstaff, I'm encouraging it.  Not to mention the fact that Okafor isn't even Bickerstaff's employee yet! The Bobcats own the rights to sign him, but no contract has been completed. And it's his own time - it's not like he's opting to leave for Athens mid-season.  American sports teams attempt to control their players a great deal, much to the detriment of international competition. I have a feeling similar situations will occur when the baseball World Cup gets started either in 2005 or 2006. I have a hard time thinking that many MLB organizations are going to be excited about their pitchers playing hard in exhibition games. What if they get hurt? It could affect their chances at winning a World Series a great deal.   It has already happened in baseball, during the 2000 Olympics. Because the Summer Olympics fall not only during the MLB season, but also the most important time, the pennant stretch, major leaguers don't have the opportunity to play. But, for the first time that year, minor league players were selected to go, instead of college players. Problems arose. Some MLB clubs refused to allow their players be considered, including the Yankees. Some organzations demanded to know what role any of their potential players would play. They wanted to determine if they felt it was more beneficial for the club if the player just stayed at home. The most well-known instance involved the Cleveland Indians and LHP C.C. Sabathia. Team USA manager Tommy Lasorda wanted Sabathia on the team, but he didn't have a spot for him in the rotation. He figured Sabathia would be a great option in the bullpen. The Indians didn't like the sound of that. So they didn't allow Sabathia to participate.   American teams should take a look at the way European soccer works. Every star player (who is fit) played for their respective countries in the Euro 2004 tournament and qualfying rounds. Often, especially when World Cup qualifying heats up, clubs allow their players to miss league games to play for their national teams. Clubs aren't excited when something like that happens, but they allow it to happen, because qualifying for the World Cup means so much to each nation's federation (and FIFA will get involved if they don't). It's a matter of national pride, something that has been lacking amongst American clubs and athletes.   I can't blame many NBA players making up excuses for why they aren't willing to play in this year's Olympics. The security concerns in Greece justify some hestitation at least. American athletes' apathy when it comes to international competition is another story altogether. I think some of that mentality is fostered by their team's management, and that's really cheating non-American athletes from the opportunity to compete in a truly global event. Basketball and baseball need look at how great the World Cup and other international soccer tournaments are, how they promote the sport and generate interest in professional franchises. A little more commitment could go a long way.

      Now that I'm back, it's time for the return of the weekend TV guide. It's not a huge weekend of sports, certainly not like last weekend.  FOX has interleague baseball again this weekend featuring some of the top matchups. New Yorkers will get to watch the Yankees-Mets series, but thankfully FOX won't be showing that game to the entire country. Here in Atlanta, the Red Sox-Phillies game will be on, which should be a solid matchup.  Saturday's other big event is Wimbledon, with plenty of Americans still playing on both the men's and women's sides. ESPN and ESPN2 will have live coverage Saturday from 8 am to 3 pm.  For those that want something different, there's also Euro 2004 action, with Sweden taking on the Netherlands in what could be a very exciting encounter. The match starts at 2:45 EDT, so head down to your local pub to catch it.  Sunday, NASCAR takes on a different look with the road course race in Sonoma. For people the tire of watching cars make lots of left turns and drive in cricles, here's a chance to see the stock cars do something else.  Sunday's golf action will feature the final round of the Booz Allen Classic, which is lacking many of the big names after last weekend's grueling US Open.  Euro 2004 quarterfinal play also concludes Sunday with the Czech Republic (the tourney's only undefeated, untied team) taking on Denmark.  Finally, ESPN will give New Yorkers nationwide their fill of the Yankees and Mets with the final game of their weekend series Sunday night.  Overall, this weekend is a break from the last few weeks featuring playoff finals and major championships, but a strong slate of baseball helps make up some of the slack. But with July 4 coming next weekend, you know there will be plenty to watch then.

      Well, I have returned from Europe with a full case of Euro fever. Euro 2004 has been the biggest thing going the last two weeks for me, and my first day back in the States, I'm glued to the England-Portugal match.  So far, this year's tournament has been filled with the unexpected surprises, stunning upsets, and spectacular goals that make major tournament soccer so great. But what really sets it all apart is the fans. I managed to attend one match, Sweden's 5-0 thrashing of Bulgaria, and it was amazing. Swedish fans turned their corner of the stadium into a sea of yellow, with their chants ehoing loud and proud thoughout the match. The Bulgarians, though smaller in number, were a vocal bunch as well (at least until the rout was in full effect in the late stages of the game). There were also plenty of fans of other nations present, like me just happy to be in attendance.  Lisbon itself was great fun as well. The main areas downtown were filled each afternoon and night with fans of all the competing nations, out enjoying the sights in their team colors during the day. At night, fans crowded the outdoor restaurants singing and chanting their favorite tunes. It was as festive of an atmosphere as I have ever seen, and the fans all seemed to get along quite well, despite the reputations of soccer fans that we often hear about in the States.  I also visited the Euro 2004 Fan Park in Lisbon. Full of games and activities for everyone (and free to get in), it was another great gathering place for Europeans to gather and celebrate the sport they love. The biggest attraction was the giant TV screens that showed each match to those who couldn't make it to the stadium. The day I visited, we were able to watch the Germany-Netherlands match with thousands of fans from all over in a fun, festive atmosphere. With the chants of the German and Dutch fans decked out in their colors, it was almost like being at the game.  Overall, it was a phenomenal time. I came away with a greater regard for European soccer fans, and can't wait for the opportunity to join them again, this time with my own team to support. Without a doubt, I will be wearing the red, white, and blue in Germany two years from now, cheering on the USA and enjoying the great celebration of the World Cup.

      Is there a more revered individual award in professional sports than the MVP award in baseball? Sure, each of the other leagues have their own MVP awards, but none carry the weight that baseball's does. The baseball MVP award is the Oscar; the others are Golden Globes - they're nice, but they just don't mean as much.   This is the second part in a series where I'll take a look at the best active players in baseball that haven't won the MVP award. I'll look at the 5 most surprising candidates in different age classes, rank the level of surprise that they haven't won, and take a look at their chances to pick one up before they retire.   Today, let's look at the veterans who are probably past their prime, but still could have very good seasons left in them - players between the ages of 31 and 35 on Opening Day 2004.    5.  urlLink Brian Giles  Age: 33 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .302/.417/.563 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 13th in 2002  Chances of winning an MVP: 5%  It hasn't been a common career path for most superstars. Giles didn't get an opportunity to play in the majors with a loaded Indians lineup until 1997 at 26. Through 1998, despite pretty good numbers, Giles remained a part-time player. Then, in the offseason and with a surplus of outfielders, Cleveland traded Giles to Pittsburgh. It was the opportunity he needed, and he took advantage of it. Giles exploded on the National League, averaging 33 HR and 104 RBI since then. A big part of his problem MVP-wise has been the teams for which he's played. Even if he would have been a starter in Cleveland, he would have shared the limelight with perhaps the strongest batting order of this generation. And in Pittsburgh, the Pirates have only won more than 75 games once in Giles tenure there. Now with San Diego, things are looking up team-wise, and MVP-wise. While merely an afterthought in the voting while a Buc, Giles has the potential to get some real nationwide recognition on a Padres team that could be pretty good very soon. At the same time, because of the late start to his career, Giles is already 33 and will probably never be as good a hitter as he was early in his Pittsburgh career.    4.  urlLink Jim Thome  Age: 33 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .285/.411/.568 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 4th in 2003  Chances of winning an MVP: 15%  I know a lot of people probably disagree with me ranking Thome this low in the list, perhaps rightfully so. Thome is a monster, but I think the players to follow are better. I mentioned the strength of the 1995-2000 Indians lineup earlier, but Thome really puts it into perspective. Thome, playing 3B, and Manny Ramirez were part of that lineup, which powered the Indians to its first pennant in 41 years. For the most part, those two players alternated batting order spots... one usually batted 7th and the other 8th. Yep, that's right. Two of the better sluggers of this generation, and not slouches despite their youth, formed probably the strongest bottom third of a batting order in history. Thome is so powerful (40 HR per 162 gms in his career) that many people forget or don't realize that he's a very disciplined hitter. His OBP routinely tops .400 and he's never drawn fewer than 89 walks since he became an everyday player. He just recently launched his 400th HR, and seems destined for at least 500, might even have a shot at 600. Thome is making a pretty decent case for winning the 2004 NL MVP when you couple his batting statistics with his role as the veteran leader of a very solid Philadelphia club that has a great shot at the postseason. He might not have many more chances like this left in his career though.   3.  urlLink Gary Sheffield  Age: 35 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .299/.401/.527 Best MVP finish: 3rd in  urlLink 1992  &  urlLink 2003  Chances of winning an MVP: 5%  It was a slow start for Sheffield. He was a hotshot prospect for the Milwaukee Brewers in the late-80s. Brought up in 1988 as a 19 year-old, he understandably struggled. After a bottoming out in 1991, the Brewers made a classic bonehead move and gave up on Sheff. He was traded to the Padres in Spring Training 1992 for Jose Valentin, Ricky Bones, and Matt Mieske. Great trade, Bud! All Sheffield did was make the best run at a Triple Crown this generation has seen that season. While he wasn't successful (1st in BA, 3rd in HR, 5th in RBI), it was still good enough for a 3rd place MVP finish despite being on a sub-.500 team. Sheffield has had some other monster seasons since then as well, including 1996, 2003, and 2000, when he hit 43 HR while playing with the Dodgers. 43 HR while playing 81 games at Dodger Stadium is pretty remarkable. However, I don't like his chances at winning an MVP at this point. He's 35, is playing in the American League for the first time since 1991, and on a team of superstars, which will split their MVP votes. The window isn't completely closed though. While Lee will disagree, I think Sheffield is closing in on induction to Cooperstown. An MVP season this late in his career would cement it, in my eyes.   2.  urlLink Carlos Delgado  Age: 31 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .284/.395/.558 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 2nd in 2003  Chances of winning an MVP: 20%  Now, if I told you that Player X batted .344 with 41 HR and 137 RBI, would you, even in such a high-offense era like today's, doubt that he'd won an MVP award that year? Well, those were Carlos Delgado's numbers in 2000... and he finished 4th in the voting! Jason Giambi won the award, and he wasn't a bad selection, but Delgado has had a few Jimmie Foxx/Frank Thomas-type years and is still yet to be named MVP. Delgado is an RBI-machine, which doesn't mean as much to me, but is important to MVP voters. His chances have probably been damaged by the AL East quite often. The Blue Jays have struggled to keep up with the Yankees and Red Sox in recent years, and without playing for the playoffs, Delgado gets lost in the mix a little in September. He's still not too old, and capable of putting together 3 or 4 more tremendous seasons, so I think he's got a pretty good shot to capture the elusive MVP.   1.  urlLink Manny Ramirez  Age: 31 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .317/.413/.598 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 3rd in 1999  Chances of winning an MVP: 20%  Despite being ridiculed by the media and fans for a very nonchalant attitude, Manny Ramirez is still one hell of a hitter. Like Thome, he was an afterthought in the Albert Belle/Carlos Baerga lineups in Cleveland. When he got his chance to shine though, he took advantage. He's averaged 41 HR and 134 RBI per 162 games throughout his career. His career slugging percentage is almost .600 - that's top 10 all time. While there's a decent chance that will go down as Ramirez hits the decline phase of his career, he's still going to go down as one of the most feared power hitters in the game. The knocks on him include his refusal to pinch-hit while "sick" and the fact that he was born to play DH. The media will hold that against him. But he's come back from an offseason of discontent and been nothing but a model ciitzen in 2004. No one can deny how devastating Manny is with a bat in his hand.   Next time, I'll take a look at the younger veterans, ages 26-30, guys who have plenty of time and as good a shot as anyone of winning the MVP.

      I'm going to preface this by stating that I don't think that Mike Tyson should box again. For one, he's getting pretty old (38) and older boxers take too many risks with permanent brain damage. For another, the guy is not and never will be mentally stable. Which makes the fact that the New Jersey Athletic Control Board granted Tyson a boxing license yesterday fairly surprising. But, I'm OK with that. It's their decision - they're certainly more qualified than I am to make such a decision.   I am not OK with Gov. James McGreevey's proclamation that he will not allow Tyson to fight at any state-owned venue. Basically, McGreevey does not agree with the Board that Tyson should be allowed to box in New Jersey. He's forgetting that it's not his job to make such a determination. The proper organization made it, and he has no right to attempt to override it by keeping Tyson out of state arenas.   It's akin to Florida Gov. Jeb Bush determining that the punishment given to NASCAR drivers Matt Kenseth and Kevin Harvick for wrecking each other was not stiff enough, and he will not allow them to race in the upcoming Pepsi 400 at Daytona in July. (I know Daytona International Speedway is privately-owned - pretend that it isn't.) It just doesn't make any sense.  The members of the Board may or may not be capable of making the best decision in this case; it's hard to turn down the money a Tyson fight would bring to New Jersey. But the Board has the power to decide either way, with which that decision should not be interfered.

      If you know me, you know that I don't care for Mike Fish much at all. Most of his columns make me think he's more interested in finding scandals and improprieties than he is in reporting news.    But I agree with just about every point he makes in this column on the distinct separation of the NCAA and BCS. It doesn't make an ounce of sense that the NCAA doesn't control the postseason in D-IA football.   I understand why the bowls were necessary back in the old days. Champions were determined solely by poll votes, and bowls could invite whoever they'd like to play in their games. There was no playoff, nor any attempt at creating a national championship game. The common Big Ten motto - "Winning the Rose Bowl is more important than winning a national championship" - certainly originated in those times.    Unfortunately for the Rose Bowl, the times have changed. With the explosion in popularity and the 85-scholarship limits, college football has become a widespread national institution. And with that increase in popularity comes an increase in scrutiny, scrutiny over a system that doesn't crown a true champion. This generation's fans demand finality, an undisputed winner. The BCS has tried to give us that, but it will never be foolproof. The only way to ensure that true #1 team is a playoff.   What's terribly frustrating to fans, myself included, is that this is plain to see. The fans knows college football needs a playoff. The players know it. Most of the coaches know it. The media knows it. The school presidents... well, they don't really care, as long as the money is rolling in.   Of course the bowl committee's are going to want to keep status quo - it's the optimal situation for them. For the most part, they still get to select which teams come to their games, and the first thing they look at is how many tickets they think each team will sell. If a playoff system were implemented using existing bowls (I promise, I'll get to my plan to solve college football column as the season draws closer), then the bowl's wouldn't have much of a say on the matchup they get.    As long as the bowl committees keep the school presidents in their pockets, the bowl system as we know it is not going to go away. Mike Fish is right - we need the NCAA to step in and take over this operation. Myles Brand needs to grow some balls and take control. A playoff would generate so much money, money that could go straight into the NCAA's grubby hands.    For an organization that is known to be over-controlling and dictatorial in its rule, it's astonishing that they've allowed these things to go on for so long. For the first time in my life, I'm asking the NCAA to crack down, and it does nothing but sit by idly, letting the millions of dollars a playoff would generate blow away into the wind.

      Is there a more revered individual award in professional sports than the MVP award in baseball? Sure, each of the other leagues have their own MVP awards, but none carry the weight that baseball's does. The baseball MVP award is the Oscar; the others are Golden Globes - they're nice, but they just don't mean as much.   This is the first part in a series where I'll take a look at the best active players in baseball that haven't won the MVP award. I'll look at the 5 most surprising candidates in different age classes, rank the level of surprise that they haven't won, and take a look at their chances to pick one up before they retire.   Today, let's look at the grizzled veterans, players with ages of 36 and above on Opening Day 2004.    5.  urlLink Craig Biggio  Age: 38 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .287/.375/.432 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 4th in 1997  Chances of winning an MVP: 1%  Biggio is one of the more underrated players of the 90's. He's the prototypical scrappy middle infielder that every manager wants. He plays good defense, willing to work the count and draw walks, and has an uncanny ability to get HBPs. In his younger days, he was a very threatening basestealer. Like most leadoff hitters in MVP balloting, his skills aren't appreciated enough, especially in the new age of 50-HR sluggers. The reality is, MVP voters have never shown as much support for leadoff hitters as they have middle-of-the-order batters. And with Biggio's skills declining rapidly, and a move to center field that hasn't been as successful as the Astros had hoped, he virtually has no shot at winning an MVP in his career.     4.  urlLink Fred McGriff  Age: 40 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .285/.378/.511 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 4th in 1993  Chances of winning an MVP: 0%  McGriff was a very good player for longer than most people realize. He's averaged more than 30 HR and 100 RBI per 162 games throughout his career. His most basic problem MVP-wise, was that he often played second fiddle to teammate. When he came up with Toronto, George Bell was the established star player. In San Diego, Tony Gwynn was an icon. Glavine/Smoltz/Maddux, and later Chipper Jones, took most of the spotlight in Atlanta. And nobody pays attention to the Devil Rays. After a midseason trade to Atlanta and helping power the Braves over the Giants in 1993, McGriff garnered enough votes to finish 4th, but never finished in the top 5 in any other year. The Crime Dog was a guy who you just kept thinking would have one of those devastating, dominating seasons - it just never came dominantly enough. Literally in the twilight of his career, McGriff is only on a major league roster because Tampa Bay is doing him a favor, giving him an opportunity to get his 500th HR. There is absolutely no chance that McGriff will win an MVP.    3.  urlLink Roberto Alomar  Age: 36 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .301/.372/.444 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 3rd in 1999  Chances of winning an MVP: 3%  Not many people realize it, but Robbie Alomar is getting close to 3,000 hits. He needed 321 hits coming into the 2004 season, and while he isn't even close to being the player he once was, it's a pretty good bet that he'll get there eventually. Alomar suffers from some of the non-slugger bias that Biggio does. There was no 2B in the 90s who could match his package of defense, speed, and good hitting. He only hit more than 20 HR three times in his career, but had 34 or more doubles seven times. Alomar hasn't been the most popular player since his spitting incident with umpire John Hirschbeck, and that may have affected his MVP voting in the late-90s. After a horrible season and a half at Shea,  half of one with the White Sox, and now a lengthy stay on the disabled list to start his tenure in Arizona, it looks like Alomar has run out of legitimate chances at an MVP award. At the same time, he's a little younger than the candidate reviewed thus far, so there is the slight possibility that he comes back with a monster 2005. I wouldn't expect it though.     2.  urlLink Rafael Palmeiro  Age: 39 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .291/.373/.522 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 5th in 1999  Chances of winning an MVP: 1%  Palmeiro is a lot like McGriff. There have been numerous debates as to if and which of the two will be the first player to hit 500 HR and not gain entry into the Hall of Fame. While I mentioned that McGriff never seemed to put together that one fantastic season, Raffy actually did. In 1999, he set career highs batting .324/.420/.630 with 47 HR and 148 RBI, and even won the Gold Glove at 1B despite playing most of his games as a DH. Great numbers, even in the high-offense era. But Palmeiro finished 5th in the MVP voting, with his Texas teammate Ivan Rodrgiuez winning the award. Just a little bad luck, as Pedro Martinez, Alomar, and Manny Ramirez turned in outstanding seasons the same year. Between Palmeiro and McGriff, Palmeiro is more likely to make the Hall of Fame. He only needed 220 hits at the start of the 2004 season to reach 3,000 and that, along with well over 500 HR gives him a pretty good argument. Palmeiro isn't likely to have another bust-out season though, and playing on a Baltimore club that's mediocre at best doesn't help.    1.  urlLink Mike Piazza  Age: 35 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .319/.388/.572 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 2nd in 1996 and 1997  Chances of winning an MVP: 5%  I know, Piazza is a year too young to be put in this group. However, with all the years he's spent behind the plate, his body has aged a bit more than the average player, so I'm putting him here. Sue me if it bothers you that much. Among the players on this list, Piazza has gotten a lot closer to winning the MVP than anyone else. He finished 2nd in both 1996 and 1997, and it's my opinion that he deserved to win the award in 1997. Larry Walker was the actual winner, but he also had the advantage of playing at Coors Field, while Piazza was stuck in Dodger Stadium. I suspect that Piazza's lack of defensive ability hurt him a great deal more than it should have in the minds of MVP voters. If you haven't, you should read an article in  Baseball Prospectus 2004  on evaluating catchers' throwing ability, and how many runs are actually prevented or allowed based on it. Piazza ranks as one of the worst catchers by that method. At the same time however, the method concludes that the extra runs Piazza gives up in the running game is more than made up for with his bat. Unbelievably more. Piazza is by far the greatest hitting catcher in the history of the game. There's simply no arguing that. And that's with spending virtually all of his career in premier pitching parks, Dodger Stadium and Shea Stadium. He was also the best player on some pretty good Dodger teams. Unfortunately, because of the demands of the position, most catcher's bats decline sharply in their 30s. Despite playing more at 1B with the wallowing Mets, Piazza has started to feel the effects of all that abuse, and probably will never be able to put together another offensive year capable of winning an MVP.  Next time, I'll take a look at players age 31-35 and see if we can find some guys who have a better shot at picking up that elusive MVP award.

      Lee usually handles the soccer news around here, because he knows it better than I do, but with him away, I wanted to touch on Euro 2004 quickly.  On Sunday, Group B kicked off with what might end up being the premiere match of the entire tournament: England vs. France. Anybody who passed 8th grade history knows the depth behind this historic rivalry. Take into account that both sides are quite strong in international play and you've got the makings of a classic. And just to top it off, something extraordinary happened.   England scored the match's first goal late in the 1st half on a header by Frank Lampard from a David Beckham free kick. Later in the 2nd half, English striker Wayne Rooney drew a foul in the box. A successful penalty kick, which to the uninitiated has something like a 95% success rate, and England takes a commanding 2-goal lead. Alas, French GK Fabien Barthez made the save, stopping Beckham and keeping hope alive.  It seemed it wouldn't matter, as England held off France for the rest of regulation. But in soccer, the end of regulation isn't the end of the game. Because the clock runs continuously, even when the ball is out of play, at the end of each half the referee adds on a few minutes at his discretion to make up for it. It's known as stoppage time.  It's an understatement to say that French captain Zinedine Zidane made the most of stoppage time Sunday. Early on, Zidane tied the game with an equalizing free kick. Beckham's missed PK had become the difference between an English win and a tie.  But that's not all. Later in the stoppage time, near the conclusion of it, French striker Thierry Henry made a run at scoring the game-winner, and Steven Gerrard had no other option than to commit a foul on him. In the penalty box. Penalty kick for France.  Zidane made his kick. Miraculously, France won the match.  Beckham had not. Devastatingly, England lost. Unbelievable.  What a way to start the tournament.

      It might be the matchup of the year so far, at least in the National League, when the Cubs start an important four-game series in Houston tonight. The Cubs and Astros will probably outlast the Cardinals and Reds to duel for the Central division, with loser a great chance for the NL Wildcard. Mark Prior will be making his 3rd start of the year, while  urlLink Roger Clemens  gets his first attempt at a 10-0 record.    Clemens really has been the story in not just Houston, but all of baseball this year. Clemens was recruited by friend and fellow FA signee, Andy Pettitte, to join him in Houston, despite plans to retire following the 2003 season. With the Astros willing to make some concessions to him, most notably allowing him to be away from the team on days he's not scheduled to pitch, Clemens signed up. And the NL Central is feeling the brunt of it.  Clemens is 9-0, with a 2.08 ERA (2nd in the majors) and 88 K (5th) in 78 innings. Not too shabby for a guy just a couple of months shy of his 42nd birthday. He's still throwing in the mid-90s. He's just a freak of nature.   There seems to be a good number of great athletes who are able to play late into their careers. Most recently, we've seen Clemens, Barry Bonds, Jerry Rice, and Karl Malone, and Nolan Ryan before them, play much longer than their contemporaries. There's one common denominator in each of their successes - workouts. All of those guys are known for having legendarily grueling workout regimens. Keeping their bodies in such great shape throughout their careers has seemingly allowed them to maintain some of their skills into their 40s. It's also allowed them to have relatively injury-free careers, another factor that just cannot be a coincidence.  While as a Cubs fan, I'll be rooting for Clemens to get lit up tonight, I can't help but marvel at how well he's pitched this year. It only adds to a legacy that includes an unprecedented 6 Cy Young Awards, 2 World Series rings, and 319 wins (and counting). Not so washed up yet, eh Dan Duquette?

      Even though the Stanley Cup playoffs over, the bitter rivalries aren't. As the offseason begins in the NHL, the imminent labor war is starting to heat up.   There's going to have to be a compromise here. Ownership's demands to reduce player salaries drastically are going too far. The players union's refusal to accept any payroll-controlling mechanism is irresponsible, knowing that the NHL generates less revenue than any of the other major professional sports.  The reality is, both sides are busy digging in their heels. Neither side is going to cave easily. And that's why the start of the season will be delayed... at best. Cooler heads will not prevail in time. There's a real possibility that a good chunk, if not all of the 2004-05 season will be canceled.   Coming off a pretty exciting playoffs, at least here in Tampa, the NHL is perilously close to losing a large chunk of its fanbase. That's something the league can't afford to have happen.

      I leave the blog to John for the next two weeks as I depart on vacation for Spain and Portugal. If I get the chance, I will try to get in a some short entries, but who knows. Plus, I probably won't be too up to date on what's going on here in the States.  I will however be on top of the happenings at Euro 2004, the European Soccer Championships. Euro 2004 begins Saturday in Portugal, when the hosts take on Greece. I'll be watching the matches each evening, and attending Monday's Sweden-Bulgaria clash.  Bars (mainly the Irish pubs) around the US will be airing most of the games at noon and 2:45 EDT each day. I hope you can check out some of the action, because it is an exciting event that I actually think can be more fun to watch than the World Cup due to the number of high-quality matchups. This Sunday, one of the early highlights will be the France-England match, scheduled for a 2:45 EDT kickoff. The French are the defending champs, and I'm picking them to take the title again. England will be ready though, and expect a fantastic match.  Hope you'll tune in, and I'll report when I can.

      I've been biting my tongue on this issue, but now with a press conference imminent, I'm not gonna hold back anymore.  The NCAA/BCS conference commissioners are creating a 5th BCS bowl game, to appease the non-BCS teams who have filed suit against them. Those schools claim that it is too hard for a non-BCS conference member to be selected for a lucrative BCS bowl. With a 5th BCS bowl, the BCS can lower the standards a bit  to give those schools a better opportunity.   The 5th bowl will rotate among the 4 current BCS bowls. The national championship host each year will host the 5th game as well, played around January 1st. The national championship will be played a week following the rest of the BCS bowls, so typically around January 8th.  Ugh.  How is this easier for anyone than a straight playoff system?  The NCAA's #1 reason (at least publicly) against installing a playoff system is that it will draw the season out too long. Well, it was just extended another week, albeit for just two teams, but extended nonetheless. Besides, Division I-AA already has a 16-team playoff system implemented, so the NCAA isn't really worried about the number of games those guys are playing.  A playoff system would also benefit the non-BCS schools more than the 5th bowl. Under the near-implemented plan, 10 schools, BCS or non-BCS, will have an opportunity to play in what ABC wants you to believe are major, important bowls. In a playoff, the top 16 teams will play in definitely meaningful games.  (Sometime in the near future, I'll put together my full plan on how to implement a successful Division I-A playoff system. It's nothing terribly revolutionary, but I think its a good start.)  Also, what happens if in a given year, the best non-BCS team finishes with a final BCS ranking in the 20s? Do they still get a spot in the new game? Or does that slot go to a more deserving, but BCS-conference team?  And who's gonna watch this 5th game? Sorry, but a Texas-Tulane matchup just isn't exciting enough to hold my attention during a week when I'm watching football every day for 9-10 days straight. It just ain't gonna happen.   As you can see, while this 5th game scenario is less problematic than the other models kicked around recently, it's not really solving anything. Unfortunately, this isn't uncommon when it comes to the NCAA.

      During the most recent round of CBA negotiations between owners and the MLBPA, the biggest story, aside from a potential work stoppage, was the threat of contraction. Commissioner/owner Bud Selig claimed that it was not financially viable for some teams to remain in operation. These teams couldn't compete with the successful clubs because they couldn't handle the payroll necessary to attract good enough players to win.   Among the teams mentioned as contraction candidates:  - The 2003 World Series champion Florida Marlins, who defeated the Mighty Yankees and now have more WS titles than the Phillies despite playing about 10% the number of WS-era seasons.   - The Oakland Athletics, who have won 90+ games and made the playoffs in each of the last 4 seasons.  - The Minnesota Twins, who have won 85 or more games the past 3 seasons, as well as the AL Central in each of the past 2 seasons.   As you can see, Mr. Selig is a bona fide idiot.   Which brings us to perhaps the most interesting case study of teams once destined for contraction: the Anaheim Angels.  Yes, the lowly Angels, in the small market confines of Los Angeles, just aren't able to compete with the big boys, said Selig.   But low and behold, in 2002, they sneak into the playoffs as the AL wild card team, beating out the vaunted Boston Red Sox. Then they eliminated the Yankees, ending their 4-year pennant-winning run. Alas, another series win, this time against the aforementioned Twins to win the AL pennant and a trip to the World Series. And despite facing a determined Barry Bonds, having his best postseason ever, and the San Francisco Giants.... they won again. Disney, owners of the Angels, were ecstatic. They'd escaped the shadow of the Dodgers. They'd formed their own identity. So what's their next logical step? Sell the team, of course!  Arte Moreno stepped up to buy the team, and hasn't done nothing but endear himself to the fans. His first act as owner? Lower beer prices at Angels Stadium. What a way to start off your tenure. The fans loved him already.   Then came the most recent offseason, Moreno's first as team owner. The Angels have been notoriously burned when they've ventured into the major free agent market. The signing of Mo Vaughn in 1999 was a disaster, one that had kept the Angels from making another big splash signing.  Then, Moreno opened up his wallet and committed almost $150 million to sign pitchers Bartolo Colon and Kelvim Escobar, and outfielders Vladimir Guerrero and Jose Guillen.   So far, the results have been mixed. Guerrero is the frontrunner for AL MVP, and Guillen has been surprisingly better than expected. On the other hand, Colon and Escobar have been disappointing.   Now, Moreno is trying his hand at the draft. Many believed that Long Beach State RHP Jered Weaver was the top prospect in this year's draft. However, following the Padres' lead, 11 teams passed on Weaver, unwilling to meet his bonus demands. Guess who had the 12th pick? The Angels snatched up Weaver, another sign that Moreno is willing to invest money into signing players.  Moreno's short tenure is starting to resemble George Steinbrenner's. He's willing to put in the money, even out of his own pocket, if he thinks it will make the team better. And I think its good for baseball.   Let's face it, when you hear Selig or your local owner complain that he's losing money on an annual basis, it's mostly BS. If owning a baseball franchise is so unprofitable, why haven't more owners bowed out? These guys have made their fortunes on being good businessmen, and they wouldn't hold onto a franchise if they kept losing money. That's just reality.  That means a lot of the owners, many of whom are now faceless corporations, have been and continue to pocket the profits, while complaining publicly that they have to slash payroll in order to stay afloat. You know you suck as an owner when profit margins are more important than winning percentage.  While he's often villified by the public, Steinbrenner refuses to sacrifice winning for profit. And it seems like Arte Moreno is willing to do the same. And I find that quite refreshing.

      Ah yes, it's that wonderful time of the baseball season that we all look forward to in the Selig Era - interleague play. Don't know about you, but I can't wait to see my team (the Braves) match up with the giants of the AL Central this week. First, it's three games in beautiful Detroit against the Tigers, then three games in Chicago against the White Sox (hey, the Braves haven't even visited Wrigley yet this year, but who cares). And I am deeply saddened that my upcoming trip to Spain and Portugal means I will miss the next homestand featuring matchups against the Royals and Indians.  I keep reading columns about how fans just love interleague play and flock to the ballpark to see the games. Somehow, I seem to be missing that. Sure it was a fun novelty when it started, and I'll even admit that the "rivalry" series have been good for the fans - the Braves will get three sellouts when the Red Sox come to town. In fact, thanks to those three games against Boston, the Braves will likely be one of many teams to report increased attendance from interleague play.   Currently, Atlanta is averaging 27,852 fans per game. Let's say they average 25,000 per game for the Royals and Indians series (and I'm being generous here - they barely averaged that against the Phillies last weekend). Then the Red Sox come in on July 4 weekend and you get three sellouts or near-sellouts, averaging 45,000 per game. The nine-game interleague average ends up being 31,667, nearly 4,000 more than the non-interleague average. So everyone will crow about the great interleague bump in attendance.  Well, let's suppose that instead of playing 6 interleague series this year, the Braves played one additional series against each of the six NL Central teams - three at home, three on the road. I'll split it fairly evenly and say the Braves would play at Milwaukee, Cincinnati, and St. Louis, while getting another home series against Pittsburgh, Houston, and Chicago. My guess is that there would be a similar attendance number for the Pittsburgh series as KC or Cleveland. Houston would bring in probably 35,000 average for a weekend series in June, and the Cubs over July 4 would sell out just like the Red Sox. That means an average attendance of 35,000 for those nine games, a much bigger increase than the interleague games.  If baseball wants to keep interleague, here's my idea - limit it to the one "rivalry" series each year. Make it our one special treat, and get the sellouts that those games generate. But as for the rest, it's just a waste. I'd much rather see the NL teams I never see anymore (but who the Braves will likely be fighting for a wild card this year) than some random AL teams that I don't care at all about.

       I know that I've talked about what Dave Andreychuk means to this Tampa Bay Lightning team. So I won't go into it too much today. I just want to point out, that even during the postgame interview, with the reporter asking him about his personal quest for the Cup, he answered that he was proud of the entire team and that they deserved it. He refused to make the story about himself, and consistently deflected all questions that made it seem like the story should focus on him. He's the kind of athlete that I want my kids to idolize.  OK, what can be said about the Lightning's accomplishments? I think they're pretty self-explanatory. When the Flames took at 3-2 lead headed back to Calgary, many people wrote them off, yours truly included. They showed no effort, no desire to win.  In Games 6 and 7, they came out and played with as much heart as they have all year long. They were more talented, and when they started working as hard as Calgary, they won. They were beat up by more-physical teams in the last two rounds of the playoffs. They were resilient enough against Calgary to play their two best games when all hope seemed lost. There's something to be said about that kind of desire.   I don't know what else to say. Everything was said on the ice last night.

      This weekend was one that proved the old adage "That's why they play the game." Or the match, tournament, or run the race. Who would have guessed some of the results that we saw over the past few days?  In the NHL, Tampa Bay once again refused to go down, winning Game 6 in Calgary and setting up a deciding seventh game tonight in Florida. In the NBA, the Pistons quickly served notice that they weren't going to roll over against the Lakers, stealing Game 1 in LA.  In tennis, your 2004 French Open champions are Anastasia Myskina and Gaston Gaudio. Only hard-core tennis fans had even heard of those two before the tournament, and no one could have predicted they would be the winners. Gaudio was only the third unseeded man in the Open Era to win at Roland Garros - the other two were Gustavo Kuerten and Mats Wilander, both of whom were young up-and-comers that went on to have very good careers. Gaudio had been around a while and only won two other tournaments.  In the NASCAR race at Dover, the top challengers kept crashing, and Mark Martin drove to victory lane for the first time in over two years. Martin is still a big name, but hasn't been among the elite drivers in NASCAR over the past two seasons. He had a top-10 car at best Sunday, but sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.  Finally, the biggest upset of the weekend was Birdstone's stirring victory over Smarty Jones at the Belmont. As has been the case many times over the years, the extra length of the Belmont seemed to be the deciding factor in denying a potential Triple Crown winner. I can't say I was as surprised as everyone else about Birdstone - I only wish he had made such a run at the Kentucky Derby, when I had wagered on him as my longshot candidate to win.  So what lies ahead this week and next? Who will prevail in the NHL tonight and the NBA Finals over the next two weeks? And who will be golf's next major champion at the US Open next weekend? Right after that comes Wimbledon. Stay tuned sports fans, because we've just seen that you never know what will happen.

       It doesn't happen often, but I'm happy I was wrong.  The Lightning clawed themselves to a big Game 6 victory Saturday night in Calgary, a game that I've said they could not win. It may have taken a 2nd OT to get it, but it's a win nonetheless. And the Bolts live to play a Game 7 on Monday night.  Thoughts that ran through my head tonight:  - The Lightning came out ready to play in the 1st period. They were aggressive, almost relentless. I wanna know where this was in Games 3-5. I guess there's no more powerful motivator than having you backs against the wall.   - With a pair of goals and an assist on the game-winner, Brad Richards will be remembered as the star of this game. But, D Pavel Kubina played almost as well. Kubina was on the ice numerous times, blocking shots and dangerous passes in front of the net. He helped clamp down on Jarome Iginla, holding him pointless. I hope his effort doesn't get lost in the shuffle.  - Overtime playoff hockey is probably the most nail-biting experience in sports. It's definitely more nerve-wracking than the other major team sports. There's such an emotional ebb and flow because it's hard to anticipate when the winning goal will come. The speed at which one team can be on the attack and all of a sudden be on the defensive is both exhilirating and terrifying.   - I hope my house is fairly sound-proof, because the yell "SCOOOOOOORE!" that I let out when Martin St. Louis found the back of the net was ear-piercing enough to give myself a headache. And yes, even though I was watching the game at home, by myself, I always yell "SCOOOOOOOORE" when the Lightning get a goal. Is that pathetic?

      Is it Friday already? These short weeks can fly by. Anyway, it's time to take a look at what's on this weekend for your sports viewing pleasure.  Tonight is pretty empty - check your local listings for the MLB game in your area.  Tomorrow, get up early if you're actually excited about the French Open women's final. Somehow, we ended up with an all-Russian final. And amazingly, it's between about the only two Russian players who couldn't work as models if their tennis games faltered.  FOX Saturday baseball is again fun regional coverage. That means the Braves-Phillies for me (hey, just like last Saturday!). I think I've ranted on this enough over the last two weeks. If I'm lucky, they will at least not subject us to Tim McCarver and Joe Buck again this week.  Hey, there's actually good golf on tomorrow! The Memorial has a major-type field, and is shaping up for a big weekend. Tiger shot a 68 today to get into contention, and guys like Ernie Els are also right at the top right now. There's even been a Ben Curtis sighting, as the British Open champ looks good on his home course. I'll definitely be checking that out some tomorrow, and watching pretty closely on Sunday - this is the big tuneup before the US Open in two weeks.  There's also a quick event not to be missed late Saturday afternoon, as Smarty Jones becomes the latest horse to try to win the Triple Crown. We've seen quite a number of close calls over the last several years, but no one has closed the deal. Smarty was dominant at the Preakness, so we'll see if he can pull off the win at the Belmont. Heck, he hasn't lost a race yet, so maybe he'll get it done. I think it would be kind of neat, if only for the fact that I was at the Kentucky Derby and would like to be able to say that I actually saw a Triple Crown winner take the Roses.  Tomorrow night, Game 6 of the Stanley Cup gets the stage pretty much to itself. Will Calgary close it out, or does Tampa Bay have enough left to send it to Game 7? Should be pretty good.  Sunday morning, it's the French Open men's final, again featuring players from the same country. Argentines Guillermo Coria and Gaston Gaudio will face off to see who is the first Gran Slam champion from the South American nation since Guillermo Vilas in 1979. I'm picking Coria in 4 sets - he was an easy pick before the tournament, and has done nothing to suggest that he won't win it.  Sunday afternoon, it's NASCAR action from Dover. The Monster Mile always provides good racing action (especially since they realized that 400 miles was enough there - 500 was just way too long). And be sure to check out the new above-track seating at Dover - that looks really cool. Of course, there's also the final round at the Memorial later in the day, so there's a couple of solid if not spectacular choices for Sunday afternoon. Personally, I love NASCAR and golf on lazy Sunday afternoons - they are great for watching and dozing a bit if needed.  Sunday night, the NBA Finals finally get underway with Game 1 of the Lakers-Pistons series. I'm guessing the Lakers cruise in Games 1 and 2, suddenly stumble in Game 3, lose another in Game 4 or 5, then crush Detroit in Game 6 for the title. That should happen around the 4th of July, I think. Seriously, I probably won't be watching - it the season finale of the Sopranos Sunday night, and that's much more important (especially since rumors are swirling that the final season won't begin until the Spring of 2006).  That's about it for the weekend. Solid choices, fairly well spread out. Possibly four different major champions could be crowned too. Pick and choose what you want, and enjoy.

      I finally made it back to Turner Field last night for the first time in a month. I had actually planned to go one night a few weeks ago when the Diamondbacks were in town, but was unable to get anyone to go with me. Of course, that was the night Randy Johnson pitched a perfect game (yes, I'm still kicking myself about that).  Last night, my friend Jon and I were able to walk up less than an hour before game time and purchase two club level tickets right next to the press box area, some of the best seats in the stadium. Cost: $2 each, thanks to the wonderful voucher program for employees of Turner/Time Warner/AOL/whatever (actual price was $30 each).  It's amazing how much attendance has fallen here in Atlanta over the past few years. Last night should have been a 40,000+ crowd, not 24,000 as it was. Philadelphia, the team who was supposed to knock the Braves from their 12-year perch atop the NL East, was in town for the first time all year. The two teams split four games in Philly last weekend, and were just 1.5 games apart in the standings. Yet the stadium was only half full. Amazing.  To tell the truth, I don't necessarily mind so much. You're always able to get a ticket wherever you want, it's not cramped, and traffic isn't bad at all (I used to take public trasnport to the game, but now that the city has decided to charge $3.50 a person for a 5-minute bus trip from downtown to the stadium, it's much easier to just drive and pay the $10 to park).  Well, the Braves were on their game last night, despite a lineup that included 3 guys who spent 2003 in AAA, and another who is eligible for AARP membership. At least that last guy (Julio Franco) provided me with a historical moment by becoming the oldest player ever to hit a Grand Slam. It wasn't a perfect game, but it was still a very enjoyable night at the ballpark.

      I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the effects of a grueling 7-game series with the Flyers. Maybe it's the tail-end of a long season. Maybe it's the cross-country flights.   I don't know what it is. But, the Tampa Bay Lightning have seemingly lost any desire to hustle and play hard.   They came out flat to start Game 5, the third game in a row in which they've done so, and it cost them the game. As poorly as they Bolts played in the 1st and 2nd periods, showing no enthusiasm or energy to speak of, they were still in the game at the 2nd intermission, only down by a late-2nd period goal from Jarome Iginla at a near-impossible angle.  But they came out in the 3rd period, and with the help of a power play, tied the score at 2 in the first couple of minutes. With the crowd back into the game, the Lightning played the 3rd period the way they've played throughout these playoffs. They made spectacular plays, set up wide-open one-timers, checked ferociously, outskated the opposition, and just worked hard. The complete opposite of the way they played earlier in the game.    Unable to get a winning goal, despite two close calls for Kiprusoff in the last 5 minutes, the game moved to overtime. The Lightning continued to play hard, got some great scoring opportunities, but weren't able to capitalize on them. The Flames finally did late in the period, and now take a commanding 3-2 series lead back to the Saddledome.  I just don't get it. I don't know why they are playing Laker-ball (flipping the switch when they need to, so to speak). With Nikolai Khabibulin on his game last night, the Bolts shoudl have won. They were on home ice, didn't have to deal with the thin air of the Rocky Mountains, and knew the magnitude of that game.   Now, they have to head north, back into enemy territory, against a team that isn't nearly as affected by the altitude as they are. And now, there is no room for a lack of effort, there is no margin for error. Even if they do come out, and win Game 6, they still have to come home and win another game. Remember, they haven't won back-to-back games for almost a month now (Game 4 vs. Montreal, Game 1 vs. Philadelphia).  Talent doesn't always win out, and this is a prime example. While less-talented, Calgary has forced the play and outworked the Lightning the entire series. They act like they want it more. The Lightning have put forth a lackluster showing, with no sense of urgency.  I think it's gonna cost them the Stanley Cup.

      John and I had a discussion earlier today via IM regarding the state of soccer. We started out discussing the long road of World Cup qualifying (which begins soon for the US' 2006 campaign) and whether or not the World Cup should be held every two years.  From there we moved on to discussing how soccer has fared in the US since the World Cup was held here 10 years ago this summer. Here's the transcript of that discussion:   John : I don’t think switching it [World Cup] to every two years will be as bad as some of the 'purists' claim it will be.   Lee : Well, here's the obstacle: Europe still rules FIFA, and the European Championships are on the off years. That event is as big to the Europeans as the World Cup.   John : Understood, but they could make that an every-two-year event as well, in the odd years. More tournaments = more money for the Federation too.   Lee : No, then you're packing in too many matches, with qualifying overlapping for the two events. Soccer players can't be expected to play 12-months seasons every year.   John : I didn’t know there was qualifying for the Euro tournament.   Lee : Yep - only 16 teams make the finals, and there's like 50-something countries in the federation.   John : Ahh   Lee : In Europe, WC qualifying will begin in a couple of months, then after the 2006 WC, Euro 2008 qualifying will begin within a couple of months. What we need is for North and South America to have a combined championship tournament the same years that Europe has theirs. The Copa America currently has 12 teams - the 10 S.American countries, plus 2 North/Central American countries they invite. This year, it's Mexico and Costa Rica.   John : How is the money divided from World Cup tournaments? Obviously, the host gets a good chunk, but what about the rest of the net revenue? Does a good portion of it get equally distributed to the federations, or the participating squads, or what?   Lee : I'm not really sure.   John : How much more profitable is a World Cup over Euro?   Lee : Overall? Probably a good bit. But for Europe, I'd say the Euro is.   John : Well, yeah. I’m guessing Euro is bigger for UEFA. But I wonder if its enormously more profitable, moreso than double the number of World Cups, especially if money is distributed equally to teams, with them getting what - a guaranteed 9 teams in, and a 10th from time to time. In theory then, UEFA teams are getting almost a third of any shared revenue, not to mention that it seems like the WC is in a European city every other year. If FIFA guarantees that the World Cup will be held in Europe once every 4 yrs - then maybe UEFA is more willing to play ball.   Lee : Yeah, but I'd still imagine they make more off Euro. Plus, now Europe will get fewer WC. 2006 is Germany, but then 2010 is S. Africa, 2014 will be Brazil, and 2018 could very likely be the US. By 2022, I'd place my bets on China. Europe won't see it again until 2026.   John : Well, if they were given an every other WC hosting, under my plan (starting after 2010 since that is a confirmed site), then it could be something like: 2006 - Germany 2010 - South Africa 2012 - England 2014 - Brazil 2016 - Spain 2018 - Beijing 2020 – Italy 2022 - US   Lee : Well, I think the 4-year rotation is fine. Plus, I personally love the Euro more than the WC (besides the fact that the US isn't in). There's fewer games between two sides I have no interest in seeing - the least desirable games this year are Switzerland-Croatia, Bulgaria-Sweden, and Czech Republic-Latvia. And I'll be at the Bulgaria-Sweden game.   John : I just don’t like that the stars of soccer only get a few chances at that global stage. Obviously, hardcore fans are gonna watch all the regional tournaments and intenrnational friendlies and stuff. But none of that compares to the WC, in my eyes.   Lee : Well, the Euro is still a pretty huge stage. Like I said, the better idea is to make the Copa America a competition for all of North and South America.   John : Well, is it as much fun for us to play just the South American teams, than the Europeans and the rest of the world? I don’t think I would be too psyched about playing Argentina as much as say, France. I know the European players better.   Lee : Maybe not - but we don't control FIFA and never will.   John : Yeah, I recognize that yours or my interests are much different from FIFA's.   Lee : Well, I mean the US's interests.   John : Right. This being the 10-yr anniversary of the US WC, how do you think soccer's popularity has changed in the US? Steady increase? Decrease?   Lee : There's been an increase, but it's definitely had some ups and downs. I think the 2002 WC performance was a huge boost, but MLS hasn't quite moved forward the way it was hoped.   John : I’m surprised it hasn’t increased more.   Lee : Yeah, I am too really.   John : And I say that because, our generation was the start of the widespread youth soccer increase - I saw it among my friends as far back as elementary school, and as late as my brother just finishing up his senior season playing in college. I’m surprised that that hasn’t had more of an impact on soccer interest. That generation is making up the new prime consumers in the nation.   Lee : Right - I think there's some really good things happening, but there's still not enough exposure here - ESPN has severely cut their coverage of MLS, even though its ratings compare to the NHL. MLS' failures in Florida were a big pr disaster that didn’t help either. But here's some positives: they are finally building soccer-only stadiums in more MLS cities, which will help the league financially. The ChampionsWorld tours are giving people here exposure to top European teams. MLS has been a big help in developing US talent, too.    John : Yeah, but the big problem is getting people interested enough to care.   Lee : Right, I was about to say that - the biggest problem is still the timing. MLS has to play spring-summer when the sports calendar isn't as full. But that means it conflicts with international play (MLS suffered a ton from WC 2002 because its best players missed 1/3 of the season). And it means it's tougher to attract foreign talent to help raise the quality of play. But if MLS played half their season at the same time as football, it would be ignored even more than it is now.   John : So, you think it’s basically doomed from the get-go?   Lee : I don't know. There's got to be a solution, I just don't have it yet. I think eventually they have to go ahead and adjust the schedule to conform with the internationals. The exposure can't diminish that much more since it's so poor anyway. I'd start the season as early in August as possible to get a jump. Fill the fall schedule with mid-week games. Take a winter break from Christmas through the end of January (like most of the European leagues do), then return right after the Super Bowl with mostly weekend afternoon matches, playing until May.

      Over the past few weeks, several NBA stars have indicated that they do not want to play for the US Olympic Team in Athens this year. Other US athletes have also voiced concerns about their safety at this year's games, and the media seems to be echoing these sentiments that this year's games won't be safe for Americans.  On hearing all of this, I constantly scratch my head and wonder if the Olympics have been moved to Baghdad. I wonder how many of these people have actually been to Athens before they begin to make these claims. I'm here to say that I have survived eight trips to the Greek capital in the last 20 years without ever being the target of terrorist acts. The only time I even remember being scared was on my first trip there in 1985. It was about six weeks after one of the most infamous terrorist acts of the 1980's, when a TWA plane out of Athens was hijacked and taken to Beirut. Of course, I was 8 years old at the time, and taking my first trip outside the U.S. (and flying on TWA, too). I remember seeing armed guards with machine guns standing outside the offices of foreign airlines in the city, and yes I was frightened. But as an 8-year-old who's never seen such things, it was pretty scary.  In 1985, Athens was also a very different place. Security wasn't a very big priority of the Greek government, which was instead more concerned with creating a stable democracy in a country that hadn't had any stability in modern times (In 1985, it had been just 10 years since democracy had been restored following the rule of a military junta).  Today, Greece is a member of the EU in good standing, and has addressed many of the problems it had back then. I'll be the first to admit that the Greeks still aren't good at getting things done on time (I could have told you six years agao that we would be counting down the last 100 days wondering if everything would be ready). But they are serious about security now, and will be doing as much as any other host would to ensure the safety of the athletes and spectators at the Olympics.  What everyone must remember is that these Games are different than any that have taken place before them, because these are the first summer Olympics since 9/11. The world is different now, and whether it's Athens or Atlanta, the possibility of a terrorist attack exists everywhere. In fact, let's not forget that it was in Atlanta, just across the street from where I am currently sitting, that a bomb exploded during the 1996 Games. It can happen anywhere, so let's not try blaming Athens. As for anti-American sentiment among the natives, I can say this: As long as you are there to spend money, the Greeks will treat you well. Anti-American sentiments in Greece are no different than anywhere else in Europe - many people there may disagree with US policies, but they do not harbor ill will toward American people.  To all of the American athletes and fans, I remind you that when you run scared from things such as the Olympics, then you are letting the terrorists know that they have won. Instead, I sincerely hope that the athletes will all realize what they are potentially passing up, and will decide to go to Athens and proudly represent their country on the world's biggest stage later this summer.

      I have a real problem with the callousness that the NFL showed to Mike Williams. Williams, of course, decided to forego his final two years of elgibility and enter the NFL draft this past spring.   Because he's only two years removed from being a high school senior, he only had that privilege because a court had ruled that it was unlawful for the NFL to make such a rule. It was a lawsuit by Maurice Clarett, who didn't have much of an option to return to college football, that prompted the judge to rule against the NFL. After that ruling, in order to obey the initial ruling while appealing it, the NFL announced that it would take applications for the draft from players who were previously ineligible. The only prominent player, other than Clarett, to take advantage was Mike Williams. Williams hired an agent, and started preparing to impress teams before the draft.   Not too long before the draft, an appellate court overturned the ruling, and decided that the NFL did have the power to set its own age requirements and did not have to allow Clarett and Williams enter the draft. And they did not allow them to do so.   The draft came and went without them, as the Clarett legal team furiously put together its own appeals. If the Clarett won his appeal, he and Williams likely would have been put into the NFL's supplemental draft later in the summer.   But they didn't win. Maurice Clarett pretty much has no optimal options at this point. He challenged the NFL's draft elgibility rules because Ohio State and the NCAA wouldn't allow it after his numerous transgressions. This was his only course of action.  On the other hand, Williams didn't have those kinds of problems. He wasn't in trouble. He wasn't part of an NCAA investigation. He saw an opportunity to turn professional, was assured that he'd be a 1st round pick, and decided that playing for a signing bonus and salary were more appealing than playing for tuition and books. Most of us would have made the same decision he did.  However, the door was slammed on him, just like it had been on Clarett. The NFL didn't bat an eyelash when it screwed him over. The NFL claims it warned all of the early-eligibility applicants, including Williams, that there were no guarantees, depending on any court decisions before the draft itself. And league officials probably did.   But how responsible is that really? If the opportunity doesn't arise, Williams doesn't risk his college eligibility. But the NFL, very publicly, announced that they were accepting entries for the non-eligible players. In a way, although they didn't want to, they did offer him that opportunity. And then briskly took it away when their legal counsel successfully had the earlier decision overturned.   A much fairer course of action would have been like a grandfather clause. Those early entries who applied when given the opportunity would continue to get that opportunity, while the old rules applied to any more players in the future.   As it is, the NFL opened the doors, albeit grudgingly, and when they were given the OK from the courts, they slammed those doors on the players who were more than halfway through it. That's not right.  Now, Mike Williams is having to petition the NCAA to allow him back into USC. The NCAA isn't known for it's flexibility with athletes either, especially when agents are involved, so it's not going to be easy. Williams did not attend spring semester classes, expecting to be a professional, and will probably need to do a lot of summer coursework just to get eligible. Plus, the whole agent issue still has to be resolved.  As for Clarett, he's just about run out of options. His best one is probably to try to catch on with a Canadian Football League, if for no other reason than to give NFL scouts some game tape to scout him on before the 2005 draft. Remember, Clarett hasn't played organized football since the 2002 Ohio State national championship season.  I don't really care what happens to Clarett - he's the one who painted himself into a corner. The real victim is Williams, who innocently made the decision that he thought was best for himself. He wouldn't have made it if he knew that the court's decision would be overruled. If it turns out that the NCAA will not allow him to regain his eligibility in time for the 2004 season, which is possible, then he's really getting screwed.  Thanks to the NFL's cold-hearted decision, you can file this as another case of  Nice Guys Finish Last .

      Ok, here's my rundown on the NL All-Star voting, complete with current leaders, my choices when I voted a month ago, and the choices I will make this week when voting.   NL:   C  -  Mike Piazza.  I voted for Piazza a month ago, but now I'm considering the homer vote for Johnny Estrada, who's definitely having a worthy season. In fact, he may be the Braves' only All-Star this year, which says something about the team.   1B  -  Albert Pujols.  I voted for Jim Thome last month (fantasy league bias there), and while Thome has continued to play well, there's no way I can vote against Albert Pujols right now. I mean, the game's going to be in Houston, where Pujols has been unstoppable this year. This is the most loaded position in either league (Casey, Helton, Bagwell, Overbay are all worthy candidates too), but right now Pujols is proving he's become the best hitter in baseball. No way I'd pass him over.   2B  -  Jeff Kent.  I voted for Marcus Giles in May, and if he hadn't gotten hurt probably would have again. Now, Kent's an easy choice.   3B  -  Scott Rolen.  I voted for him in May, and I'll do it again. My roommate loves Mike Lowell, and he's deserving as well, but I'm sticking with Rolen. Amazingly, this means Adrian Beltre and Aramis Ramirez will fight it out for the third spot on this team.   SS  -  Adam Everett.  I voted for Edgar Renteria last month. He's not playing up to his usual standards, but there's deifnitely a shortage of candidates here. I'll likely go with Jack Wilson, who actually has been playing great (though if he's still over .340 by the All-Star break I'll be shocked).   OF  -  Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Ken Griffey Jr.  No real surprises that these guys are the fans' choice. I voted for Bonds, Richard Hidalgo, and Miguel Cabrera a month ago. Well, needless to say things changed with these guys over the last month. Bonds still gets my vote, but now Lance Berkamn is clearly the Astro OF to take. The final spot is up for grabs - Moises Alou, Craig Wilson, Pat Burrell, Steve Finley, Jeromy Burnitz, and many more could be considered. Griffey's been a good story but still doesn't make the cut, while Sosa likely would have until getting hurt. For now, I'm leaning toward Alou, who gets my vote partially for the memories of his game-winning hit at the 1994 All-Star Game, the only Midsummer Classic I was lucky enough to attend.  So there you have it. A month from now, I'm sure we can revisit this, and see how dumb some of my choices were (just like some of the choices from my first ballot now look). That's what you must remember with the All-Star voting though - it takes place over two months, so there's much that can happen. Without a doubt, somewhere a player is hitting .270 with 7 or 8 homers right now but will be at .310 with 18 HR when the squads are announced. Just remember that when the annual complaining about fan voting comes up - there may be the occasional lapse in judgement, but the fan vote is part of what makes the game special.

      Now that we've reached June, Major League Baseball has released the first update on the year's All-Star voting. Over on SI.com, their baseball writer John Donovan has already dissected these results and come to the conclusion that the fans don't know what they're doing. I'd have to disagree.  For starters, the balloting began a month ago - when most teams had played only 20-25 games. I cast my first votes at the Braves game on May 4 (so long ago that it was the last time the Braves had been above .500 until today). So imagine how different the stats were at that time than they are now. Granted, fans voting for Nomar Garciaparra aren't thinking too much, but many other candidates are solid choices so far.  Here's the current leaders, along with my votes last month, and my likely votes when I go to the ballpark later this week.   AL:   C  -  Ivan Rodriguez.  I voted for Javy Lopez in May, and see no reason to change now. But Rodriguez is a fine choice as well, as is Jorge Posada. Any of these three guys deserve it, and I'd bet all three end up on the squad.   1B  -  Jason Giambi.  I actually voted for Mark Teixera back in May, but injuries have slowed him and even back in the lineup now, he's not producing. Right now, I don't know who I'll vote for, as there's a lot of guys underachieving.   2B  -  Alfonso Soriano.  I voted for him in May, and I'll do it again. Sorry, I'm not buying into Juan Uribe or Ron Belliard.   3B  -  Alex Rodriguez.  I voted for Hank Blalock in May, and might again. He and A-Rod have very similar numbers, and both are deserving. Melvin Mora's definitely a contender too after an amazing May.   SS  -  Nomar.  Here's the head-scratcher from the fans. I voted for Miguel Tejada in May, and see no reason not to again. Voting for Michael Young also makes sense. Young and Tejada should be the guys who end up in Houston.   OF  -  Manny Ramirez, Vlad Guerrero, Johnny Damon.  I voted for Vlad, Carlos Beltran, and Jermaine Dye in May. Now, I'll still vote for Vlad, probably for Manny, and then a toss-up: Maggio Ordonez, Jose Guillen, or Beltran.  That's my take right now. I love the opportunity to vote, and I'll admit that I do have some biases that come in to play, like the fact that you'll notice I'm not voting for any Yankees. If there's someone just as deserving on another team, that's who gets my vote - if a Yankee is clearly the best at his position, I'll vote for him, but that's not the case anywhere.   That wraps up the AL outlook. I'll split this into two posts so that it's not overwhelmingly long.

      Unlike the NFL Draft, the annual MLB draft usually passes by with little fanfare in the general public. There's an interesting story that's developing, less than a week from draft day (June 7th).   The San Diego Padres own the first selection in the draft, courtesy of their NL-worst record in 2003. It's been a widely-known fact that San Diego's front office was targeting Long Beach State RHP Jered Weaver. Weaver has had a phenomenal year for the 49ers, going 14-1 with a 1.68 ERA and in 128.1 IP, he's struck out 193 batters, while only walking 18. Like I said, phenomenal numbers. Nobody would question taking Weaver with the first overall selection.    However, Baseball America is reporting now that the Padres are taking a long, hard look at Florida State SS Stephen Drew. And they might even be leaning towards selecting him. Drew finished the regular season batting .353, with a .469 OBP and .692 SLG.   My first reaction to this news was that the Padres were bluffing. Not bluffing other teams (with the first pick, they don't need to), but bluffing to the rumored large signing bonus demands that Weaver will make. But, for those that do not know, Stephen Drew is brother to former Seminole J.D. Drew, a Scott Boras client who sat out an entire year of MLB-affiliated baseball because the Phillies wouldn't meet his signing demands. Like his brother, Stephen will also be a Boras client. But this theory of mine was completely discredited, when I read that Jered Weaver will also be represented by Boras. If the Padres were worried about exorbitant signing bonuses, they would be refocusing on a non-Boras client, you would think.   So maybe San Diego's interest is genuine. There isn't much to not like about Stephen Drew. He's a good hitter with some pop and above average speed. He's not a bad fielder at SS, but if necessary could probably make a smooth transition to 2B, CF, and maybe even 3B.  There are two standard criticisms on Drew. And both are partially attributable to his brother J.D.'s reputation. First, he's injury-prone. It's true that he's missed a good chunk of games as a Seminole, more than J.D. ever did. Combine that with J.D.'s injury history as a professional, and you get scouting directors antsy. Secondly, much like his brother, Stephen has a very laid back demeanor, which comes off as indifference. The Drews aren't rah-rah types, and people get the impression that baseball doesn't matter to them. But again, scouts are taking what the impressions they draw from J.D. and apply it to Stephen.   Stephen Drew must overcome the expected negative similarities with his brother, and that's simply not fair. I have a brother - neither he nor I want to be, nor should be expected, to act or perform the same way.   What really gets me about this, is that Weaver, whom most feel is the best player in this draft also has a brother in professional baseball. Jered is the younger brother of Dodger RHP Jeff Weaver. Yes, the Jeff Weaver who the Tigers and Yankees happily discarded, as much for poor makeup as poor performance. Yet, I haven't heard any concerns from scouts that Jered could turn out to be the headcase Jeff has been. Now, maybe there's something noticeably and tangibly different between the two pitchers - I don't know. It makes sense to me that the same biases should apply.   In both cases, the younger brothers shouldn't be compared against their older siblings' trials and tribulations in baseball. It's not fair, however quite inevitable. I wonder why Drew seems to be taking more heat. Perhaps it's because J.D. has been a bigger disappointment than Jeff Weaver. Who knows... I just find that fascinating.

       OK, I understand that businesses have to do what they have to do when it comes to increasing revenues. And unfortunately for me, this affects me a lot.  If you haven't read Rob Neyer's work at espn.com, you should. He's quite good and one of the only columnists who I read regularly. And for those that do, yes, that little icon you see to the upper right is legit - Neyer's near-daily baseball column is moving to the ESPN Insider package. That means, in order to read Neyer's column, you'd have to pay for it. It's not an unaffordable price, but I'm going to personally refuse to justify some corporate guy's decision.   I would guess that there will be a lot of people who will subscribe to ESPN Insider as a result of this, and that's their choice. I'm not trying to persuade people to follow me. I guess I'm just venting at the frustration.   Over the past couple of years, espn.com has supplied numerous reasons for me to visit less often (much like Sportscenter has supplied plenty of reasons not to watch - that will have to wait for another time). The most recent was the incessant attempts to get ESPN Motion installed on every computer in the world, while slowing down the page loads across the site. The decision to put Neyer on pay-per-view is just another reason to stop going altogether.

      Tuesday dawned in Paris with the Williams sisters headlining the day's schedule, one round away from facing off against one another in the semis. A funny thing happened along the way to that date though - both sisters went down to defeat, meaning this year's women's champion won't be any of the three women who have claimed the last eight Grand Slam titles.  So who is left? Well, Paola Suarez is this year's mystery semifinalist after disappointing male fans everywhere with her defeat of Russian teen Maria Sharapova. And Anastasia Myskina, another of the Russian brigade that is overtaking women's tennis, took out Venus in straight sets to reach her first Grand Slam semifinal. Myskina was the #6 seed in this tournament, but her quick work of Venus certainly qualifies as a major surprise.   That brings us to the biggest match on the women's side today (and likely what will go down as the top match of the tournament) - Serena vs. Jennifer Capriati. Jen Cap has got to be one of the best stories of this year, as she has staged yet another comeback after her career began to slide. Amazingly, she was the last player not named Williams or Henin-Hardenne to win a major when she took the title at the 2002 Australian Open. Since that time however, her game had slipped back into the realm of upper-tier, but not top-level player. Since a slow start to the 2004 season following a back injury, Capriati has come alive on the European clay, reaching the semis in Berlin and the finals in Rome (where she beat Serena along the way).  Again today, Capriati was able to win some of the big points that she had come up short on over the past couple of years. Her confidence has returned, and with it, a game to match the world's best. Now, she's back in the semifinals and as the only remaining player who has won a Grand Slam title before, Capriati has to be considered the favorite.  The Williams sisters may be gone, but there's still one big reason to keep watching the French Open women's competition: to see if the charismatic, sometimes engmatic Capriati can once again recapture the glory of a Grand Slam champion.

       The Lightning didn't look too good, but with a hot Nikolai Khabibulin, were able to even up the Stanley Cup Finals, as the series shifts back to the St. Pete Times Forum.  And the Bolts will be happy to get back. I think the altitude in Calgary was extremely overlooked by the pundits prior to this series. The thin air more than 3,500 feet above sea level at the Saddledome has been a monstrous disadvantage. Obviously, its one out of the league's control, but I definitely think its hurt Tampa Bay's chances in Games 3 & 4.   While the TV commentators took their time ripping the Lightning for a lack of hustle, I think it was more one of two things: either the Lightning were gassed and sucking wind, or they were trying to reserve as much energy as possible for the 3rd period. It was probably more the former, but I gotta think that, especially in Game 4, the coaches told the Lightning players to pace themselves a little.   Either way, it has been a battle for the Lightning in Calgary. And because that thin air isn't going away for Game 6, I think that the Lightning are in a must-win situation in Game 5. They were lucky to get a win up there; it took a great game from Khabibulin and some dumb penalites, namely Vinny Lecavalier's faceplant from Villie Nieminen.   A loss in Game 5 would mean the Bolts would have to win in Calgary to force a Game 7, and I'm not confortable with their chances on that. Hopefully, at home and in normal air density, the Lightning cane get some momentum going and put the pressure of the Flames for the first time in this series.

      With the All-Star Break behind us, baseball kicks off the second half of its season tonight. Here are a few things I'm looking for:   NL East  I think this is the year the the Phillies hold on and win the division. The Marlins will be tough competition, but in the end, I think they're short a good power hitter, and I don't think there's a trade they could make to fill that need. The Philadelphia offense is going strong, with typical brilliance from Jim Thome and Bobby Abreu, along with a resurgent year from Pat Burrell. I don't the Braves or Mets will have enough to hang with either Philadelphia or Florida.   NL Central  While it's not completely over, I think you can pencil in the Cardinals as division champs. With the best batting order in the league and a surprisingly solid pitching staff, the Redbirds have been on cruise control the last few weeks. It also helps a great deal that they only have to play the Cubs two more times for the rest of the regular season. Speaking of the Cubs, with their vaunted pitching rotation all healthy for the first time this year, they should bounce back from a bad stretch leading to the break. They will win the Wild Card, and be a very dangerous opponent in the playoffs.    NL West  Who's gonna make a deal? I think that's what it comes down to between the Dodgers and Giants. Both teams really need a slugger to plop down into the middle of the lineup. The Dodgers have been rumored to be interested in Carlos Delagdo - that might be enough to give them the edge. But I think the Giants win the division, because while he doesn't get the publicity cross-Bay Area rival Billy Beane does, Giants GM Brian Sabean has consistently made good stretch-run deals, propelling his team into the playoffs. I trust that he'll get the better trade done and pull out another division title.   AL East  The Yankees won't be looking back, at least not in terms of the regular season. I do expect them to pick up Randy Johnson, if for no other reason than to keep the Red Sox from getting him. If Boston does not get the Unit, I don't think they win the Wild Card. There are just too many strong teams in the West this year.   AL Central  The White Sox made the bold move by picking up Freddy Garcia, and they will win the Central because of it. With the rotation solidified, and Magglio Ordonez off of the DL, the White Sox are looking mighty strong. The Twins need another pitcher to help out Johan Santana, and there aren't any really good ones left (the Twins obviously can't afford Unit).    AL West  I think the Angels have enough to move ahead of the surprising Rangers. At some point this year, this patchwork Texas rotation will have to fall apart. The Angels are solid everywhere, and they might look to pick up Randy Johnson to top it all off. But don't forget about Oakland. Eric Chavez is back, Bobby Crosby is getting better everyday, and Barry Zito can't be this bad. And Beane is bound to make a trade of some sort, perhaps even getting Carlos Beltran from the fading Astros. The A's take the Wild Card from the Unit-less Boston.   Awards  - I think Scott Rolen and Vladimir Guerrero keep cruising and win MVP awards.   - Jason Schmidt runs away with the NL Cy Young, while Mark Mulder continues to fly under the radar to win in the AL.  - Bobby Crosby and Khalil Greene ride a pair of big second halves to win Rookie of the Year Awards.

      I look forward to the MLB All-Star Game every year. I still contend (and always have contended) that baseball's mid-summer classic is by far the most entertaining and compelling all-star game. Who could forget magical moments like when John Kruk stepped in against Randy Johnson or when Pedro struck out 5 in 2 innings or when Ted Williams tipped his cap to Red Sox fans in his final appearance at Fenway.  Well, last night's game didn't produce any of those kinds of memories. The one thing I'll probably remember about that game was the look on Roger Clemens' face after Soriano's homer. The game wasn't even compelling, not even when the National League recovered to get within 3 runs. And I blame that on interleague play.   A big part of the All-Star Game's appeal to me was the potential for tons of matchups you wouldn't see elsewhere. While cross-league free agent signings has helped take that away, interleague play has done more to damage that aspect. You're gonna see Barry Bonds vs. AL pitchers every year. I understand the good things that interleague play may have brought to baseball, but you can't deny that its harmed the allure of the annual All-Star Game.  - Also, I just want to say, last night was my first exposure to Fox's Scooter character.... and if this is the "re-tooled" version, they need to re-tool this thing out of its misery. Keep the kids stuff to This Week In Baseball or something like that.   - Fox also debuted the new super-small infield cameras. While better than the NBA's version (the camera in the middle of the lane), I want to know who was the salesman who sold these ideas to the networks. They aren't providing any revolutionary, "inside the game" views. It's just another weak TV gimmick that will disappear discreetly when TV execs figure out that they cost too much to not offer anything to the telecast.   - Does anyone else find it idiotic that a bad day for a pitcher on the NL Central's 5th place team gives the AL pennant winner homefield advantage in the World Series? Didn't Commissioner Bud proclaim that the All-Star Game would be played to win? Starters would stay in longer, managers wouldn't try to get everybody in the game... any of that ring a bell? I didn't see this All-Star Game get managed any differently than the tie in Milwaukee, way back when "it didn't count." The players were as semi-interested as usual. They wanted to win, but it wasn't the end of the world. If the National Leaguers had mounted a late rally to force extra innings, both managers would have been in the same situation as 2002, with the game possibly ending in another tie. I guess Bud just doesn't have all the answers, now does he?

      In my haste to depart for the holiday weekend last Friday, I missed on doing the weekend guide. But I return this week with a promise not to do so again. Unfortunately, there's not too much happening this weekend.  Tonight, ESPN actually has a Friday night game. Of course, it's the Braves and Phillies, which will already be on here. Hopefully that means they will have an alternate game so I can check it out between innings.  Tomorrow looks pretty bleak. FOX has a full slate of regional games (more Braves-Phillies here), and that's about as exciting as it gets. The Tour de France is on OLN (Outdoor Life Network) for those who are keeping up with Lance Armstrong's quest for a sixth straight victory. Otherwise, I can't really recommend much.  Sunday's best offering is the NASCAR race from Chicago. Unfortunately, Chicago is one of the newer flat ovals that have taken much of the excitement out of stock car racing, so it probably won't be too exciting.  Golf fans (and only the most hardcore will probably tune in) can check out the final round of the John Deere Classic, which has a fairly weak field due to its date right before the British Open.  Baseball will head into the All-Star Break Sunday night, with the Cardinals and Cubs wrapping up the season's first half in an NL Central battle. That should be a fine way to prepare for Tuesday's All-Star Game, which will feature several players from those two clubs.  That's really about all. The All-Star Game comes Tuesday night, and next weekend promises to be better, with the British Open headlining. My advice - mix in some activities with your quick checks of the tube this weekend and get ready for some great events in the coming week.

      If you check out the National League standings today, it appears that Bud Selig's master plan has worked - big-market teams and small-market teams are all competing with each other in tight races. In fact, 12 of the 16 NL teams are currently over .500 and everyone in the NL East besides the Expos is within 2 games of each other.  Somehow, the NL Central, which I once regarded as the ugly stepchild of divisions (not as bad as it's AL counterpart, but still not that great), is the strongest division in baseball. And the NL East, home of big spenders, big markets, and 9 of the last 12 NL pennants, is looking pretty mediocre.  The owners of the top spot in the NL East for the last 12 years are my hometown Braves. And this year, they have looked like anything but their former selves. Yet here they come into Philadelphia this weekend with a chance to reach first place. The Phillies have wasted the chance to put this race away by the All-Star Break thanks to some disappointing pitching and a seeming lack of timely hitting (oh, and probably some credit is due here to the managerial prowess of Larry Bowa as well).   This division is so screwy that the Mets are in second place right now. The Mets, a team who finished last a year ago and seemed likely to embark on a major rebuilding task as recently as a few weeks ago, are now looking at taking the division lead. The defending World Champion Marlins have struggled at times too and look like a team struggling to find an identity instead of one who was pummeling the Yankees just 9 months ago. The Marlins have actually played quite well against their division foes, except the Braves, who they are just 4-9 against. Thankfully, the Marlins have just two series left this year against Atlanta, so they could turn things around.  So that leaves the Braves. They were written off before the season by many, then again after a slow start, and even more so just a couple of weeks ago when trade rumors began to surface that the Braves might deal Russ Ortiz or even Andruw Jones. Since then, Ortiz has been nearly unhittable, Andruw is looking less like Pedro Cerrano from "Major League", and the Braves are winning again. Next weekend, Marcus Giles should return to the lineup and the Braves will be have the top of their lineup (Furcal, Giles, Drew, Jones, and Jones) together for the first time since the opening week of the season. Throw in the pending return of Horacio Ramirez to a rotation that has added Paul Byrd in his absence, and the Braves will suddenly have a pretty solid club. It's still not as talented as most of the previous 12 versions, but thanks to the poor efforts of their division foes, the Braves suddenly have a shot at one more title, albeit in a very poor division.

      I thought that the trade Kenny Williams made to acquire Freddy Garcia from Seattle was OK... just OK. When you have a chance to acquire a very solid starting pitcher while in a pennant race, you have to. On the other hand, Williams gave up their best prospect, OF Jeremy Reed and a pretty decent young C in Miguel Olivo. It's a bit much for a player that will be a free agent at the end of the year.  But the White Sox changed that a few days ago, when they signed Garcia to a new 3-year, $27M contract. And that is more bewildering to me.  OK, so you gave up a lot to get him, and you have to do whatever it takes to keep him - I understand that logic. But $9M a year for a pitcher who hasn't been much better than average, and has actually been below average the previous two years?  His career 3.91 ERA looks pretty good, but you have to take into account that he's played most of his career at Safeco Field in Seattle, a monstrously-large ballpark. Through last year, Garcia's park-adjusted ERA is just 13% better than the average player. That's not the type of player you in whom you want to invest $9M a year.  I'm not saying Garcia will fail in Chicago. I'm just questioning the amount of money he was given. Bad contracts are usually what get GMs fired. Giving big bucks to non-superstar pitchers usually turn out to be bad contracts. We'll see how this one turns out...

      The MLB All-Star Game is still a week away, but most teams reached the halfway point of their seasons over the holiday weekend. With that in mind, here's one fan's opinion of who your award winners would be if the season ended today. Much could change in the second half, but what follows are my choices at this time. For comparison's sake, you can read Peter Gammons' linked column to see what he thinks.  AL MVP - Vladimir Guerrero. The fact that the Angels are still right in the tough AL West race with the injuries they have endured (Troy Glaus, Garrett Anderson, Darin Erstad, etc) is a testament to how great Vlad has been. Sure, some other guys like Manny Ramirez and Ivan Rodriguez have put up great numbers, but Manny's not carrying the Red Sox, and Pudge is just lifting the Tigers from the cellar to the status of also-ran.  AL Cy Young - Curt Schilling. This is a really close call right now. Kenny Rogers has 12 wins, and Mark Mulder's numbers are almost identical to Schilling's. I'm going with Schilling because he's been at his best in critical situations (like Saturday night's shutdown of the Braves after 4 straight Sox losses). I wouldn't argue with anyone who chose Mulder though.  AL Rookie - Tough call here. Lew Ford has come out of nowhere to put up some great numbers, and Bobby Crosby is improving each month. I'll go with Ford as the top guy for the first half, but I expect Crosby or someone else to make a big push in the second half (pitchers Shingo Takatsu and Daniel Cabrera are two guys to keep an eye on).  AL Manager - Some great possibilities here. I'm going with Ozzie Guillen at this point, leading a team with only one All-Star into first place in his first year as a big-league manager. It's hard not to vote for Lou Piniella though, considering the Devil Rays' turnaround. Other top contenders would be Buck Showalter and Eric Wedge.  NL MVP - Scott Rolen. Sure, Barry is still Barry. But Rolen's on pace to drive in 150+ runs, hit .330, and of course continue to play the best 3rd base of anyone in the game. The Cards have other stars too, but Rolen's play is what has carried them to the top of the tough NL Central.  NL Cy Young - Jason Schmidt. Several other viable candidates, but Schmidt has simply been the most dominant starter in the NL over the last 2 months. He has carried the Giants as much as one starter can carry a staff (similar to Pedro in his early years with the Red Sox). The Hall-of-Fame brigade (Clemens, Johnson, Glavine) have been a great story, but if I had to pick one guy in the NL to start an important game for me right now, it would be Schmidt.  NL Rookie - Another difficult choice, as no rookie has been amazing. I'm going to go with Aaron Miles of the Rockies, who will likely pop up among the NL top 10 in batting by the end of the week (he's currently just a few plate appearances shy of qualifying). Again, the 2nd half of the season is where rookies make their marks, so keep an eye on guys like SS Khalil Greene and P Chris Capuano.  NL Manager - Tony LaRussa. The Cards weren't supposed to be good enough to compete with Astros and Cubs in the NL Central, but so far they have been the class of that division. Other good jobs worth a mention are Cincinnati's Dave Miley, Felipe Alou in San Francisco, and Bruce Bochy in San Diego.

      OK, here we go with our All-Star teams. We follow all rules used to select the real All-Star teams - we're taking the voted-in starters and then filling out 32-man rosters, with at least one player from each team. Without further adieu, let's start with our 2004 National League All-Stars.  C Starter Mike Piazza, NYM  Reserves John - For my reserves, I'm taking Atlanta's Johnny Estrada, who's been more productive than anyone expected, and Dodger Paul LoDuca, who's been pretty good for Los Angeles.  Lee - Well, so far we're on the same page. I agree that Estrada deserves it, plus he's actually the lone Atlanta rep on my squad if you can believe that. LoDuca's been solid as well and makes it as the third catcher.  John - Estrada is my lone Brave as well.  1B Starter Albert Pujols, STL  Reserves Lee - This had to be the toughest position in either league to pick. There are several qualified candidates that I hated leaving off, but had no choice. I've gone with Jim Thome and Sean Casey as reserves. Thome's home run binge in June makes him an easy pick, while Casey is still at the top of the league in batting. Casey and Todd Helton were about even, but I finally went with Casey because he's meant so much to the Reds so far this season.  John - I'm taking four first basemen, and some will probably argue that I still left one out. Thome is leading the league in HR and has turned into a great veteran presence on a conteding club. Cincinnati's Casey has been near the top of the league in hitting all year long, part of a group of players that have kept the Reds in contention into the summer. So far, Todd Helton hasn't had the monster season we're accustomed to seeing, but he's still an elite hitter, and my only Rockie.   Lee - I certainly can't disagree with John's choices, I just decided I couldn't put four first basemen on the team.  John - Yeah, four is a lot, but I think it's merited. There are more 1B having good seasons than at some other positions. Also, Helton makes it for me only because I needed a player from Colorado.  Lee - Yeah, I agree that there are more deserving 1B than any other spot - that's why I said this was the toughest spot. My other toughest spot is coming up, and that's where you will find my lone Rockie rep.  2B Starter Jeff Kent, HOU  Reserves John - It's a down year for NL second basemen. But, I'll still take three of them. My two reserves are San Diego's Mark Loretta and Montreal's Jose Vidro. Loretta has quietly had his second pretty good season in a row, while Vidro is the only Expo candidate close to being worthy. Despite a slow start though, Vidro has gotten his act together and has been one of the hottest hitters in the league over the last few weeks.   Lee - Well, I am once again agreeing with John's picks. Vidro makes it as my lone rep from Montreal, while Loretta also gets in as the thirs guy here. I'll only have two shortstops, so I figure it's good to have three second basemen. Loretta definitely deserves it as one of the top performers on a very good San Diego team.  John - You've only got 2 shortstops too? You copying me?  3B Starter  Scott Rolen  Reserves Lee - Third base was my other very difficult position. Lots of guys have very similar, very good numbers. In the end, my choices were Adrian Beltre and Vinny Castilla. Beltre has been trying his best to carry the Dodgers over the last month and deserves his first All-Star appearance. Castilla's numbers benefit from Coors Field, but the 62 RBI put him on the team. Well, that and my need to fit a Rockie in after passing on Helton.  John - Looks like this will be our first big disagreement. Aramis Ramirez has to be an All-Star. He carried the Cubs and picked up the slack when Sosa was out. I'm taking Beltre as well, although it was a tough choice between him and Mike Lowell. Lowell is the consumate professional, and in my opinion, more likely to keep up with his current pace than Beltre. At the same time, Beltre has meant more to a weaker Dodger lineup.   Lee - Well, I can't fault your choices either. I actually had Lowell on my team before realizng I need a Rockie. And Ramirez and Beltre's numbers are almost exactly the same - I went with Beltre for what he has meant to the Dodger lineup (Ramirez at least had Moises Alou to help carry the Cubs along while Sosa was out).  SS Starter Edgar Renteria  Reserves John - Well, Renteria was barely voted in, but deserved the start over Houston hometown favorite Adam Everett. With that being said, I'm only taking one other SS, and that's the deserving starter, Jack Wilson. Wilson has come out of nowhere this year, and there's not much to debate about his All-Star credentials.  Lee - Well, we're agreeing once again here. Wilson is also a perfect fit as my lone Pirate rep. I like when things fall into place that easily.  OF Starters Barry Bonds, SF Ken Griffey, Jr., CIN Sammy Sosa, CHC  Reserves Lee - OK, once we get past the 500 HR club starting, there's several deserving candidates in the outfield. Personally, only one really stands above the rest and that's Lance Berkman. He's put up fantastic numbers so far, and will continue to do so with Beltran now added to that lineup. Next I went with Bobby Abreu, the most complete OF in the league who has rebounded from a slow start. I've got two other guys on my squad, though certainly could have picked others. These last two are Steve Finley, who has been amazing so far, and Adam Dunn, whose 24 homers get him in.  John - I found this to be the toughest position to pick in the NL. I agree with Berkman, and I'm also taking Adam Dunn. However, I've taken two others just ahead of Abreu and Finley (who are both fine candidates.) I'm going with young phenom Miguel Cabrera, who has shown a lot more power this season while avoiding the all-too-common sophomore slump. My final OF, and I know I could get ripped for this, is Moises Alou. Like Lee mentioned before, Alou helped Ramirez pick up the slack with Sosa on the DL. At the same time, Alou has been good all year long (despite some memorable defensive miscues). Abreu, Finley, Craig Wilson, and Jim Edmonds were the players I had to skip on here.  Lee - Well, I won't rip you for picking Alou even though I sense a bit of Cubbie bias. He's certainly a worthy candidate and a guy who adds great veteran presence. As for Cabrera, I actually had him on my team then squeezed him out at the end in favor of Finley. I actually like Cabrera a lot more, but tried not to let that cloud my judgement. I certainly won't complain if he makes the squad.  John - "tried not to let that cloud my judgement?" Sounds like a mini-rip for picking Alou. That's fine though. I'm sure there is a little bias creeping in, but being a Cubs fan, I may have a better understanding of how important he's been for that club this year.   Lee - Actually, that line wasn't meant as a rip on the Alou pick at all - I already did that. I was just saying that I tried to be really fair, and maybe too much so in that I chose a guy I really don't like over one that I do.  John - Fair enough...  Pitchers John - Believe it or not, I think the pitching staff was pretty easy to pick out. I am gonna shake it up a bit though - Roger Clemens is not starting for me. Jason Schmidt is my pick to start. Since coming off the DL, Schmidt has been absolutely dominating. Besides, I think neither Clemens nor Piazza wants to be working with each other. Clemens will pitch after Mike Piazza leaves the game. I'm also gonna take Randy Johnson as a no-brainer. I don't think I need to explain why. Ben Sheets makes the club as my sole Brewer, but I think he's also the most deserving from Milwaukee. Tom Glavine has returned to form, and he'll return to my All-Star team. I'm also going to take Carlos Zambrano and Carl Pavano, both of whom have unexpectedly be their staff's leaders. As for relievers, I went with three, all well-deserving. Eric Gagne will get a chance for redemption from last year's game. I'm also taking the graet comeback stories of Armando Benitez and Danny Graves. Benitez has been absolutely dominant, and Graves is trying to chase down Bobby Thigpen.   Lee - Ok, this is just downright frightening. I have the exact same staff as you, except that I'm carrying one additional pitcher in Trevor Hoffman, who gets the nod as the fourth closer on the team. I will disagree as to who starts though - I love the idea of Clemens pitching to Piazza, and I think the fans want to see it. Plus, Clemens getting to start at home is great as well. I won't disagree that Schmidt is more deserving, though - he's been amazing this year.  John - I love the idea of Clemens having to pitch to Piazza too. My point about the potential battery is more along the lines that neither of them would like to do it, and if I were Jack McKeon, I'd probably respect that. I think Schmidt deserves the start strictly on merit.  Onto the American League,   C  Starter  Ivan Rodriguez, DET  Reserves Lee - With Pudge Rodriguez starting, I'm going with Victor Martinez and Javy Lopez. Martinez has been stellar for the Indians, better than most anyone could have imagined, while Lopez has done pretty much what the Orioles hoped for when they signed him.  John - I agree on Martinez, however I'm taking Jorge Posada over Lopez. Lopez has been better than I expected, but Posada is the better defensively and simply the best C in the AL.   Lee - Well, I would have taken Posada after one month or even two, but he's been in a horrible slump over the last month. But since Joe Torre will be managing, Posada will probably be in Houston.  John - I don't doubt he will be, but I still think he's as good as Lopez.   1B Starter Jason Giambi, NYY  Reserves  John - Giambi is probably the first starter, in my opinion, who has no business on the All-Star team, and forcing me to take him has screwed over another player (to be revealed later). Again, I'm taking four first basemen. David Ortiz is a lock, despite his tough error the other night at Yankee Stadium, he's been the best of the bunch. I'm taking future HOFer Frank Thomas. He's had a pretty good under-the-radar year. I'm also gonna reward Ken Harvey with a great start to his year.  Lee - OK, I'm only going with 3 first basemen again. You're right, the Giambi selection does throw things off here, especially considering how many AL DH's are also first basemen. I'll agree with you on the Ortiz pick, but with my other selection I'm taking the Royals' other 1B/DH, Mike Sweeney. Sweeney has still been the main run producer in that lineup.  2B Starter Alfonso Soriano, TEX  Reserves Lee - At second base, Alfonso Soriano is a deserving starter, and it was tough for me to find any other truly worthy players. I ended up selecting Juan Uribe, in part because he's my lone pick from the White Sox - amazing that a division leader gets only one selection. Really a thin position in my opinion.  John - I agree that this is a terribly thin position this year. I've already got a White Sock in Frank Thomas, so I'm going to take Ronnie Belliard from Cleveland. He's cooled off a bit since a hot start, but I think he deserves some credit for the surprising Cleveland Indians.   Lee - I might have selected Belliard if not for needing a Chicago player. His numbers are certainly as deserving as anyone's else's at the position.  3B  Starter Alex Rodriguez, NYY  Reserves John - A-Rod is the no-brainer pick as the starter, especially given the amount of work he's had to dedicate to getting better defensively. In reseve, I'll take Hank Blalock, who's really blossoming into a superstar. Can you believe that just a few years ago, the Devil Rays declined trading Joe Kennedy for Blalock straight up? I'm also going to take Melvin Mora. I never would have thought that Mora would be able to keep this up. But he's been a very good player for a season and a half now.   Lee - Another agreement here. Blalock's continued to put up great numbers and is probably hoping to get a chance to face off against Eric Gagne again this year. I also like Mora and am amazed at the numbers he continues to put up. A very solid group there.  SS Starter  Derek Jeter, NYY  Reserves Lee - At shortstop, it looks like Derek Jeter will get the starting nod. He's managed to heat up considerably so his numbers are decent, though not starter-worthy. As the reserves, I'll take the two guys who I think are both worthy of the start: Michael Young and Miguel Tejada. Young has been a great story in Texas, moving over from second after A-Rod's dpearture and putting up fantastic numbers. Tejada has been superb in Baltimore as well, hitting for average and power and driving in a ton of runs.  John - I agree with both Young and Tejada. And it'd be hard to deny Jeter even if he weren't the starter. However, I must take issue here. I'm taking a 4th shortstop - Carlos Guillen. He should actually be the starter over everyone. He's 8th in the league in OPS - not just among shortstops, but all hitters. You could definitely argue that Pudge Rodriguez is the driving force behind Detroit's turnaround, but I think you could just as persuasively argue that Guillen's play has had an equal effect.   Lee - Not to start an entire OPS argument here John, but if it's your measuring stick, why didn't you take Jose Valentin as well? His OPS is over .900.  John - Good point. Valentin has had a much better year than I had thought. At the same time, Valentin is also notoriously mediocre with the glove.   Lee - True. I'm just pointing that out.  John - Hey, I can take the criticism - it was a valid point.  OF  Starters Vladimir Guerrero, ANA Manny Ramirez, BOS Ichiro Suzuki, SEA  Reserves John - By taking four 1B and four SS, I've decided to go with a short outfield for the ALers, just six total. I'm going to go with another Yankee, Gary Sheffield, who's had some issues with his power at Yankee Stadium, but has been pretty good nonetheless. And with my final outfielder, I'm taking the speedy Carl Crawford. Crawford has quickly developed into a good leadoff hitter, and while I still have my doubts about his long-term value, I can't deny how well he's played for a Tampa Bay team that actually is within striking distance of a wild card berth this late in the season. I'm going to add Jose Guillen here, because he's been as steady a force in the lineup as Alou and Ramirez have been amidst injuries.  Lee - Ah, now we have some disagreements. I'm also taking Sheffield, Crawford, and Guillen. My last slot goes to Vernon Wells, who makes it as the Blue Jays' lone rep. His numbers are solid, not great, but the best from a team that hasn't hit well at all.  Pitchers Lee - For my pitching staff, I'm electing to start Curt Schilling. He's done all that was expected of him since coming over to Boston and gets the nod over several other deserving candidates. The other starting pitchers for my AL  squad are A's teammates Mark Mulder and Tim Hudson, Kenny Rogers, Javier Vazquez, and Pedro Martinez. Mulder and Hudson are easy picks with their sub-3.00 ERA's, and Rogers currently leads the league with 11 wins. Vazquez has been the one constant in the Yankee rotation and will certainly be chosen by his manager Joe Torre. My pick of Pedro may be a stretch, but he's still been one of the best starters in the AL this year. I'm taking a slew of relievers as well, led by Mariano Rivera. Other relievers on my team are Twins teammates Joe Nathan and Juan Rincon (the lone middle reliever I've chosen), Francisco Cordero, and Eddie Guardado.  Nathan and Cordero have been pleasant surprises as top closers, and Rincon's 8 wins out of the bullpen deserve some recognition. Guardado rounds out the squad.  John - OK, let's see. I, too, am taking Schilling to start, as well as Mulder, Vazquez, Rogers, Pedro, Rivera, and Nathan (lone Twin). I'm passing on Hudson, mostly because of his injury situation. Rincon has been good, there's no doubt about that. But I find it hard to take a middle reliever with other good starters and closers out there. Cordero is a very solid pick, just missed my cut. In their places, I did select Toronto's Roy Halladay as my sole Blue Jay. He hasn't been as good as he was last year, but he's still one of the best on the league. He's hurt a lot by an injury-decimated lineup. I'm also going to take CC Sabathia. Sabathia keeps on soldiering along for the Indians. I took him over Cliff Lee and Jake Westbrook, because of a stellar ERA. Also, I don't think that Keith Foulke can be left off. Despite Boston's recent struggles, he's really improved that bullpen expotentially.   Lee - Well, I passed on Sabathia due to the injury concerns myself. Foulke was definitely a consideration, I just went with Rincon to do something a bit different. Halladay to me has been just too disappointing this year to add on.  John - True, I didn't think of Sabathia's injury.

      Is there a more revered individual award in professional sports than the MVP award in baseball? Sure, each of the other leagues have their own MVP awards, but none carry the weight that baseball's does. The baseball MVP award is the Oscar; the others are Golden Globes - they're nice, but they just don't mean as much.  This is the third part in a series where I'll take a look at the best active players in baseball that haven't won the MVP award. I'll look at the 5 most surprising candidates in different age classes, rank the level of surprise that they haven't won, and take a look at their chances to pick one up before they retire.  It's been a few weeks since the previous installment of this post, so if you've forgotten what I said, check out  urlLink Part 1  and  urlLink Part 2 .  Today, let's look at the guys right smack in the middle of their prime, players who have a great chance to win and still has some time on their side - players between the ages of 26 and 30 on Opening Day 2004.   5.  urlLink Scott Rolen  Age: 28 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .282/.374/.510 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 20th in 1998  Chances of winning an MVP: 50%  I was really surprised to find how little MVP support Rolen has gotten. I didn't expect Top 5's every year, but geez. This guy has been the best 3B in baseball for awhile now. He was the unanimous NL Rookie of the Year in 1997. For Phillies' fans, he was Mike Schmidt reincarnated. He's all business on the field. He's a fabulous defender, winning 5 gold gloves in his 7 seasons. This year, he's put the entire package together, and thanks to a good supporting cast, he's got a ton of RBI (which bodes well for MVP votes). Thanks to the writers' contempt for Barry Bonds and St. Louis' phenomenal record, Rolen has a tremendous chance to win it this season.   4.  urlLink Nomar Garciaparra  Age: 30 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .323/.370/.555 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 2nd in 1998  Chances of winning an MVP: 15%  A truly fantastic hitter a few years ago, a slew of injuries have slowed down Garciaparra a great deal recently. If he can get the issues with his wrist and Achilles' tendon straightened out, he could easily return to being a perennial All-Star. In Boston, he was labeled, fairly or unfairly, as distant in the clubhouse and dispassionate about baseball. But in all reality, he's always played the game hard. Following last week's trade to the Cubs, Garciaparra gets a chance to start over with at least a half-season in the National League. He's not a great defensive shortstop, and I wonder if eventually he'll move to 2B because of it. But it's always been his stick that made him a valuable player. Garciaparra's power has dropped a little bit since his wrist injury, but he's still good for 35-40 doubles and 25 HR a year. He may never match his effectiveness of the 98-00 years, but it wouldn't be a complete shock if he had one or two more of the years in him. So he's still got a decent shot.   3.  urlLink Derek Jeter  Age: 29 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .317/.389/.462 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 3rd in 1998  Chances of winning an MVP: 25%  The Golden Boy. He can do no wrong, if you listen to the national media or New York media or a Yankee fan. Jeter is probably the most overrated player in baseball today, but he's still a pretty good player. He doesn't have the power that either of his Holy SS Trinity partners (Garciaparra and Rodriguez) have. He doesn't have a whole lot of range and is a below-average shortstop, despite Michael Kay and Tim McCarver's adulation. But he is a solid, consistent hitter, and is the steadying force in a clubhouse full of superstars. He's also a sneaky good baserunner, despite not being terribly fast; highly efficient in stealing bases and always taking the extra base when possible. He's got a great shot at winning an MVP, if for no other reason than a)he plays for a perennially good team, and b)he's their captain.   2.  urlLink Todd Helton  Age: 30 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .337/.425/.616 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 5th in 2000  Chances of winning an MVP: 25%  A lot of things in baseball have changed over the past 40 years or so. The DH, relief specialists, the 5-man rotation, HR explosions. They've all played a little havoc with how we judge modern players, especially their context in history. For instance, how much credit do you take away from a player if he's primarily a DH? Well, add Denver to that list. When the expansion Rockies joined the NL in 1993, a whole new problem popped up - the altitude factor. Coors Field (and Mile High Stadium before it) have been the most offense-producing stadiums in baseball history. And Todd Helton has been the prime beneficiary. Helton has piled up some HUGE numbers, including the 4th best career slugging percentage in history. In 2000, he batted .372 with 42 HR and 59 doubles. Historic numbers indeed. How much of that credit will be taken away when people factor in his home park? Well, in that 2000 season, Helton only finished 5th in the MVP voting, so it seems to be working against him a little bit. At the same time, with these kinds of numbers, you have to expect that he'll overcome that and win one eventually. Larry Walker did.   1.  urlLink Vladimir Guerrero  Age: 28 Career BA/OBP/SLG (through 2003): .323/.390/.588 Best MVP finish:  urlLink 4th in 2002  Chances of winning an MVP: 50%  Never saw a pitch that he didn't like. That's the first thing that I'll always remember about Vlad. I swear he can hit a HR off a bounced pitch. He's such a great hitter, though, that hitting coaches don't dare try to get him to be more selective. You could make a strong argument that Guerrero is the best all-around player in baseball, position notwithstanding. He's an amazing hitter, with a ton of power, a Clemente-like arm, and, when his back isn't bothering him, is a pretty good runner. A lot of casual fans missed out on him while he was a member of the Expos. He missed having a 40/40 year in 2002 by one dinger. He hit .345 with 44 HR in 2000. He's a phenomenal natural talent. It also hasn't helped that his English isn't very good, and he doesn't talk publicly much at all. But, now in Anaheim, Guerrero has taken the American League by storm, and is probably the frontrunner for this year's AL MVP Award. He deserves it.  Next time, I'll take a look at the youngsters, some of whom are still establishing themselves in the bigs. We'll take a look at the best 21-25 year-olds and rate their chances at winning an MVP through the course of their careers.

      Last night, I enjoyed watching what has become one of my favorite "events" of the summer, ABC's prime time golf match featuring Tiger Woods ("The Battle of the Bridges" again this year). This event has been a showcase for Tiger, and certainly wasn't really ever possible before him, but it has been much more fun and kept its appeal much longer than I expected.  Last night, Tiger was teamed with Hank Kuehne, a guy that only avid followers of the sport would know, but was chosen for a very good reason - Kuehne can hit the ball far, really far. What ABC did this year was set this up as both a golf match and a long drive competition, and so they went out and got Phil Mickleson and John Daly to be the opposing team. Mickleson has been golf's biggest story this year with his Masters win and close calls at the US Open and British Open, while Daly has played as well as anyone on Tour and continues to be one of the longest hitters in the game.  The front nine went as many would have expected, with Kuehne struggling to play at the level of the other three, allowing the Daly-Mickleson team to take a two hole lead. The biggest surprise though, was that Daly and Mickleson kept winning the driving contests with ease, as neither Woods nor Kuehne managed a single drive in the fairway on the night's four "contest" holes. Each time Woods and Kuehne would miss the fairway, with Mickleson then putting an "easy" 300 yard drive in play, usually followed by a boomer from Daly. Regardless of the outcomes, it was certainly fun to watch this added element with such big hitters.  The other feature that makes this event fun is the fact that the players allow themselves to be human, conversing with the on-course reporters throughout the match, and also being miked up for live sound bites. Mickleson provided two of the best quotes of the night, both related to the long drives. First, Mickleson related a bit on his reaction to being involved in the long drive competition by stating that he normally would love competing in one, but when he was told who the other three competitors would be, he laughed that he shouldn't be involved. The second quote, caught by the mike he was wearing, was quite funny as well. After Daly's final long drive of the night (345 yards on a hole measuring about 425), Mickleson turned to his partner and asked "Do you ever get tired of hitting wedge?"  Anyway, Woods and Kuehne suddenly rallied late, winning holes 13, 14, 15, and 16 with three birdies and an eagle to take the lead by 2 holes. A final split on 17 gave them the win and concluded another fun night. Once again, ABC managed to find a way to keep interest in an event that has paired men and women, current top pros with Senior legends, and other fantastic teams. Hopefully, it will continue to provide entertainment not only for avid golf fans, but also for casual or even non-golf fans. It's definitely a cue other sports could take, creating such a viewer-friendly event where the players still give their best effort, but also have fun.

      After a slow few weeks, it's time to get back to things here, and the weekend trading frenzy is a good thing to start with. ESPN's Jayson Stark gave a recap that I really didn't agree with, so here's my team-by-team take.   The big winners:   Chicago Cubs:  I absolutely love this deal. Sure, Nomar has struggled at times, became a distraction in Boston, has health issues, and is a free agent. But the only big-league the Cubs gave up is a guy who had been absolutely horrendous all year in Alex Gonzalez (not that I've ever thought he was that great anyway). And the prospects they gave up are all guys who have some upside, but probably aren't future stars. Plus, they actually got a prospect as well in Matt Murton.   Boston:  Amazingly, the Sox came out of this pretty well too. Nomar was a distraction and wasn't re-signing, so to go ahead and get some value for him was great. Orlando Cabrera is a major defensive upgrade, as is Doug Mientkiewitz. Plus, Cabrera is a much better hitter than he's shown this year in Montreal (where the poor guy actually had to hit cleanup for a while). Cabrera's bat had shown signs of life the last few weeks, and I have a hunch that he could hit .300 over the next two months in Boston.   Mixed reviews:   Atlanta:  What, you didn't know the Braves made a deal? Yes, the Braves added lefty reliever Tom Martin from LA. As a Braves fan, I was a bit disappointed. They definitely needed a lefty in the pen, and I had heard that maybe Ron Villone would be the guy. Instead they got a 35-year-old with one decent season who is still under contract for over $1 million for 2005. At least they only had to give up a minor-leaguer who was actually demoted from AA to A this season.   Los Angeles:  I don't hate these deals as much as most people seem to. True, it looks a bit odd because the anticipated secondary deals (Randy Johnson, Charles Johnson) fell through. And truly, I think not getting Charles Johnson is the bigger loss here because of the hole now created at catcher. Otherwise, I like getting Choi to play 1st base (allowing Shawn Green to return to the OF), and Penny will be a huge lift for the rotation. I guess I'm the only guy who thinks Paul LoDuca isn't one of the best catchers in the game, so I don't view that as being as much of a loss as most people do. LoDuca's hitting .301 this year, and is just an average defensive catcher (thrown out just 28% of basestealers this year). Juan Encarnacion was a decent player, but hadn't set the world on fire in LA. And Guillermo Mota is a very good setup man, but anytime you say a 6-man trade swung in one team's favor on the inclusion of a set-up man, that's just crazy. As Paul DePodesta mentioned, the Dodgers have plenty of other live arms ready to plug into that spot.   Florida:  I think the Marlins came out ok on this, but not great. LoDuca will give them a decent catcher again, but he's not Pudge Rodriguez. Encarnacion was so valuable to Jack McKeon last year that he basically benched him for the playoffs then pretty much tossed him to the curb after the season. Mota will help the bullpen, but that's not really where the Marlins problems have been. The whole key here is whether or not Josh Beckett can stay healthy. If he does, the Florida rotation is still very good with Beckett, Burnett, Willis, and Pavano. But if not, there's a gaping hole.   Yankees:  Well, they got rid of Jose Contreras, which I think is a plus for them. In return comes Esteban Loaiza, who may or may not be hitting a wall. I think it was worth taking a chance on the veteran.   Losers:   Montreal:  Well, just continue to hope that this blight on the sport ends soon and the franchise heads to Washington. I'm sure potential fans there are really excited by this deal.   Minnesota:  Well, it seems like they were ready to deal Mientkiewitz anyway with Justin Morneau now up to stay. But I thought they could have gotten more for him. Between this deal and the failure to get Kris Benson, it's a disappointment for the Twins. Luckily, the White Sox probably won't be able to beat them out at this point anyway.   Chicago White Sox:  They made some nice moves earlier, but this one wasn't so good. Maybe Contreras will thrive out of the NY spotlight. On the bright side, the Twins didn't do much either.   NY Mets:  Yes, I think the Mets really messed up here, especially after the disastrous weekend in Atlanta that left them nine games out. No way is this team going to make the playoffs now, even with their additions. They still have a horrendous bullpen (which will still have to cover for all of Al Leiter's 5 inning, 120 pitch starts) and the league's worst defense. They got a decent deal for Benson, but it will look pretty foolish if he doesn't sign an extension (and I just can't believe that he will - Benson's a southerner from Marietta, went to school at Clemson, and still lives in the Atlanta area. I don't think NY will be his kind of town, but I could be wrong). As for the Zambrano deal, this could go down as the greatest personnel move that Chuck Lamarr ever made. The Mets traded away their #1 pitching prospect for a guy that Lou Piniella was ready to strangle anyway.  That's my take on the weekend that was the MLB trade deadline. Of course, since it's not the official end of trading, I expect a couple more moves will still be made in the next few weeks as more teams fall out of the playoff race. Until then, we'll see how these new acquisitions fare in their new homes.
