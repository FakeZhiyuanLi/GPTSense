      Today... has been long. And pretty much uneventful. Not counting early this morning (2 AM) when I woke up with a pounding headache on the left side of my head that I couldn't find a reason for, and was severe enough for me to wonder if there was something seriously wrong with me. Which would have sucked, as my health card is in my wallet which is at Amy's, and had I needed to go to the hospital, I would have been screwed. But, as... twisted luck would have it, the headache was in some way related to the fact that I needed to throw up. Which I did. At approximately 4 AM. After sitting on the couch with Mom, who also happened to be up because her shoulder was bothering her, and holding a hot cloth to my forehead for the two hours in between.   I'm really starting to get annoyed with my stomach. I can't think of anything that should have provoked that. *sighs* Though it might just be my diet in general. Ever since I started this sort of... impromptu weight loss type thing back in December, my stomach problems have escalated. Yet I have lost weight, and I don't think going back to the way I used to eat is going to help much of anything. *shrugs some* Need another visit with the doctor, I guess.   As for the rest of the day... Spent it pretty much depressed and self-destructive. Mostly because of PMS, I'm hoping. Cheered up when Taylor got home from the anime conference in Toronto that he went to, but I actually haven't talked to him much as I rented  The Last Samurai  'cause I figured he would have gotten home at about 11 rather than.. I think it was around eight or nine, heh. Movie wasn't too bad. Bit long. But enh.  My stomach is still bothering me now, even though I forced some rice into it about an hour ago. I'm probably going to end up throwing up again before I can actually get to sleep tonight. *sighs* This bites. Heh. Seriously.

      Nothing much to say, really. Just blogging for the sake of giving myself something to do while attempting to get another 8k or so on Gaia. Trying to get some pet line art that I coloured for a business I co-manage to be auctioned off... If I can sell it for my auto-buy (12k) I'm more than set, heh. As is, I have yet to get a single bidder, which makes me wonder if they're just not as cute as they seem (actually Taylor is scared of them, so maybe that is the case ^.^'), or if I'm just a really crappy saleswoman. After all, one of the other co-managers was able to auction off three at once... Then again, they were all ones that she'd coloured. Meh. Lucky blighter has a tablet.  School went all right. Finished filming  The Faketrix  in Drama, and ended up including an unscripted bit of dancing on my part, eheh heh. In the original script that Taylor wrote, it was supposed to be that the Operator runs in to find the crew of the  Abracadabra  playing charades. Seeing as we only had four actors (though technically I'm actor/co-director/co-producer/costumes/co-editor), we couldn't really simulate a crew particularly well, so instead she runs in to find me doing the cha-cha on my lonesome, all dressed up in black with the trench coat and sunglasses and everything. *sweatdrop* Ah, well. 'Tis supposed to be satirical, and at least I didn't have to wear a Hawaiian shirt and straw hat and pretend to be dancing to steel drums. Bwahaha. Poor Eric. I feel sorry for him. Honest.  Music... Well, I'm pouty about music on the one hand, as we went to the Media Arts lab to do some more work on our project rather than continue with the alternate instruments thing. On the other hand, I actually completed one of the seven or so parts I have to separate and write out.   English... We're studying Media, so the teacher brought in  Home Improvement  for us to watch and analyze. So, yeah, actually a good English class...  Soc.. Teacher wasn't there, had a sub, I did some of the work left, but spent a majority of the period writing an opening post for an RP. I didn't finish it, though, as when I started on the second part of it, an argument about why churches have to spend so much money on making their roofs high and awe-inspiring flared up all around me, so I couldn't concentrate. Yeah. Have one atheist sitting beside me, another behind her, had a Christian sitting behind me, and then the sub spurring things on in general. Being a good little pending Wiccan, I kept my mouth shut, heh.  Whoo! Bidder on Gaia, just as I was closing the auction... Never fails, hehe.

      I spent today at home. Not entirely by choice. Had I awakened this morning in sound health, I would have cheerfully gone to school for a day of sleeping in Drama, bass playing in Music, presentation watching in Soc, and reading in English. But, no, when I woke up my stomach was a big mass of nauseous cramps, so I stayed home. By the time I got up around noon, it was fine, except for being a little hungry. Which I knew would happen, but I stayed home anyway because I figured that, given the aforementioned outline of the day, it wouldn't hurt too bad to just stay home and get caught up on sleep.  I dunno, heh. I started this because I felt like I needed to rant, but all of my energy has already more or less been spent on the subject with Taylor and slightly DL. I was just a little pissed off about fifteen minutes ago because I had my mom on my back about doing chores and things to make up for "not doing anything" today. Pardon me, but it wasn't like I  planned  to be sick this morning. I was actually considering going, just for more lessons with the bass.  So, on top of my general irritation with that, I sign back into AIM after playing  Sacred  with my brother for a few hours to find that Anna is pissed off at DL for no reason. I sighed at her for taking random anger out on DL (a.k.a. innocent bystander), so she got pissed off at me, and I just logged out of AIM again. I can still talk to most of those who were on AIM on MSN, anyway. I didn't need her pissing me off all over again, heh.  Wow. That all really sounds quite pathetic, doesn't it. I blame PMS. -_-'  P.S. I did manage to get that song downloaded that was being a pain last night, with help from my brother. Taylor's sister actually had it, but the quality wasn't that great, so Allan got me another one. Which still isn't of highest quality. Bah. Recording industries just really don't want you to have that song, I guess...

      *hums absently* Like that song. Probably got the lyrics wrong, even though I was listening to it about thirty seconds ago, eheh.   I'm in a pretty decent mood. Got Kazaa Lite to download again, having uninstalled it a few weeks ago in an effort to get Diablo II to work. I was worried I wouldn't be able to get it again, as they're asking you to pay for it now, if you go to the official site. But, meh, got it off a multiple download site type thing, and it's working just spifftacularly.   That's about it for interesting news... Well, my group in drama finally got another few scenes recorded for  The Faketrix . It's not going to turn out as well as I had it in my head unless I can do some magic with editing, but meh, it's just a student film. Nobody is gonna expect it to be blow-you-away impressive. I actually got to play some notes on the bass guitar today. Once I got a little oriented with it, I was all right... Going to take a bit for me to get used to it, though. I've been reading nothing but treble clef for the past three years, and I was never particularly strong with which notes are what in bass clef back in my piano days. But, meh, I'll manage.  *pauses and twitches* Oh how I loathe those idiots who fuck up the songs that they upload to Kazaa. The main reason why I took the initiative to get Kazaa Lite tonight was so I could download  Broken  by Seether and Amy Lee, and so far I haven't had much luck getting it. Whenever I try to download it, it'll fiddle around for a few seconds trying to find a user, and then tell me that more sources are needed, even though there are two hundred some-odd results for that particular song title. I  did  get one to download, but to link this back to the start of the paragraph, it's got some fucked up noise about twenty seconds in. Absolutely  hate  that. Yeah. And I just literally went through and started  every flippin' result  downloading, and none of them will even que. Such utter, utter bull.

      Yes. So. I was dramatic yesterday. Perhaps rightly so, I don't know. Buut anyway. Things were settled again. I'm just not going to follow that thread anymore, as I don't think he's going to stop posting there, and I trust that when he says I mean so much more to him than any of those girls, he means it.   Anywho. I woke up this morning with a particularly bad stomach ache. I've been having a lot of trouble with my stomach the past few months, but the past week or so I was all right. I think what it was this morning was that I went to bed on an empty stomach, and it was all acidic and unhappy when I woke up. So, naturally, because of this (and perhaps a bit of PMS-- I really, really ought to start keeping track of those sorts of things so I know when I can blame otherwise uncalled for bad moods on hormones) I was in a pissy mood when I got to school. 'Twas a mood that persisted through some of drama, though I spent most of the class laying with my eyes closed on two desks pushed together, as we're filming movies and two of the guys in mine were doing something else today.   Music went better than expected. I play the alto saxophone, and we had a playing test today that I only really practiced for last night. I think it was one of my better performances for a test, ironically, and my mark reflected that. Then we switched instruments and will remain switched for at least a week. I chose bass guitar, though I've never laid my hands on a guitar at any point in my life that I can clearly recall. I didn't actually get to play anything today, as the teacher was too busy getting the others adjusted to different mouthpieces and such. Hopefully tomorrow.  Third period, Challenge & Change in Society, was all presentations for our end of the term ISP worth 10% of our final mark. I did mine yesterday, and I am so very relieved that it's over with. Pretty sure I did a crappy job. But at least I'm done. Fourth period, English, we were supposed to spend working on our book-to-film ISPs, but I've yet to find a copy of classic  Dracula  to compare to the book, so I spent the entire thing reading a book I took out from the library ( American Gothic  by Michael Romkey. Frankly I'm getting disappointed with it, now that I near the end.).   So, yeah. I've spent my time since getting home watching TV, resting (because I'm bloody tired after being up 'til about 12:30 AM talking with Taylor, having also not gotten to bed at particularly decent hours any other time this week, either), sending back surveys in response to the ones Taylor and Anna sent, and random chatting. I may post what Anna and Taylor said about me in their surveys at a later date-- I was quite touched by both of them. :)  After I post this, I'm going to clean my "rat" out of the drain in the bathroom (a.k.a. a mass of hair that collects over a week or two that is mostly composed of my hair, as thick, long hair sheds horribly as it gets warmer), then working on a free signature for someone I randomly met on Gaia last night. Normally I charge for my work, but her present signature just in text inspired me to make an image to go with the words. And then I shall watch Simpsons, South Park, Family Guy, and Futurama. What an active life I lead. ^.^

      Hadn't actually intended on posting again, but I need somewhere to rant. I'd hoped I would be posting those 'joys' before the 'angst', but, hey, that's the way it happens sometimes.   *sighs* So. There's this guy. If for whatever reason you happen to end up following this blog, you'll hear of him a lot. His name is Taylor. He's the longest "internet friend" I've ever known, having started talking to him about four years ago now. I love him. He loves me. I still don't know if we're boyfriend and girlfriend (side-note that I really dislike those terms, and at some point am going to come up with new words for those particular roles in a relationship), as he's been seeing another girl that actually goes to school with him (though things aren't looking particularly good for them last I heard), and we've yet to come to a long-distance relationship agreement. It's not as if it's an insufferably long-distance relationship, as it's only about four hours by train between the two of us, and in a year I plan to be going to college closer to where he is.   Now, about two months ago, he got me to join  urlLink Gaia . Last night, he posted in a thread that was a competition for the hottest guy, and yes, he is quite good looking and nummy. Initially I found out about it because he was "complaining" that he might be gaining stalkers. And, sure enough, I go onto this board and find them drooling over him left and right. This made me twitch a bit, but I was willing to let him have his fun because I know he doesn't have particularly high self-esteem and a bit of praise would do him some good. But then they started saying they want to find him and rape him (after he posted a picture of himself without a shirt holding a sign reading, "All hail Gaian woman!   So, yeah. I had to draw the line. I made a comment about wanting roasted fangirl on a bastard sword, lightly seasoned with honey garlic sauce. So one of the girls says, "Why do you hate -his username here- fangirls?!" I didn't respond right away, and another girl encouraged me to yes, eat them all. Anyway. A few replies later, he's telling me and the other girl to calm down, and eventually the girl decided that she didn't want to be part of a fanclub that people hated.   I talked to him about it later. He apologized, said he felt like a jerk... I told him not to, as I understood where he was coming from... I figured that was that. This was last night... Don't know if I mentioned that or not.   So, yeah. *sighs* He's back posting in this thread again tonight. I'm trying to talk to him about it again now. I seriously wish I wasn't so jealous, particularly as I don't know if I have the "right" to be, as I'm not his 'official' girlfriend... But when I see these girls saying they love him the most, and all that sort of crap, it really just lights that green fire of jealousy in me. Combine that with my general temper, and yeah, scary. I'm surprised my control has been so good thus far.

      I'm not quite sure why I made this blog. All right, that's a lie, I do know why-- I was looking at blog layouts at  urlLink SoulKarma  and recalled that it's been a while since I've used my actual blog, located  urlLink here . Why was this? Well, because I'm too damned lazy to bother manually formatting each new post there.   I also have a blog of sorts at my  urlLink DeviantArt site . If anything, that is likely what I might use instead of this. *shrugs*  I may post later. TV is beckoning.

      This is for research purposes. ^.^' I'm too lazy to make up a calendar to record my moods each day in order to check with a planetary calendar in a week to see if they're in any way influencing me. Hell, I'm already exploring the psychological approach, why not dabble in astrology as well...  Other than that, not a lot to say. What sparked off my down point was lack of Taylor, again. Not that he wasn't online. Just that he's been too busy/I'm assuming he's too busy to be able to avidly talk to me. Blar.

      ...he reappears, and back up into normal mentality I go.   *siighh*   One of these days, I will talk to him about the drinking thing. Just not when I'm still so happy to see him. *pauses, glances at IM* Or when he's hugging me and apologizing again. ^.^'   P.S. Partly work, partly being dragged off to a family gathering. That's why he was gone.  P.P.S. Whoops. Brought the drinking thing up anyway. There was an opening for me to draw it painfully to the surface, I swear...

      But, hey, what else is new, eh? Ah well. Fuck it. I'm the only one who reads and thus criticizes this thing anyway. *shrugs*   I started today in a blank mood. I thought I got up at quarter to two, but I guess it was quarter to three. Not that it matters, as I generally have nothing worth getting up any earlier for anyway. And, y'know what, that statement was just as true today as it has been most others. I got up, got online. No sign of Taylor, same as last night. Well, that's not entirely true. By doing some creepy stalker reconnaissance, I found out he was online from around 10 this morning until at least quarter to one. Just like how, after getting home from a wedding reception around 9:45 last night and wanting to do nothing more than collapse and talk to him, I found out he was on at around 1:40 PM long enough to discuss an av edit order with someone on Gaia, and then left. For where, I don't know. He wasn't on yet&nbsp;when&nbsp;I gave up and went to bed at about 2:30 this morning. And, yes, still no indication of life from him yet today, not since noon, apparently.   I know part of why this bugs me so much. Usually, he tells me when he's going somewhere, and for how long he'll be gone. Given, I wasn't online when he was, but he knows how I worry when he's not around. God, does he know. Given that, one would think he'd know enough to maybe leave me a PM on Gaia, or post at the shop, or something, to save me from getting in an anxious mood like I'm in now, and have been in every time I've checked MSN and seen that he's still not on.   Fuck. I know that he has a right to go places without informing me. Equally, he has a right to be out with friends, which is where I'm assuming he has been. But I can't help getting frustrated and anxious when he does go out. Part of it is the drinking issue. The other part is that he's been out more and more frequently recently, and with my ingrained sense of paranoia, I'm wondering if "friends" are just one female friend. Especially when he doesn't want to tell me when/where he's going. Which he also has a right to have. FUCK! but I hate this.   It's not his fault that I feel like this. It's not my fault, either, I guess, but that doesn't stop me from blaming myself for it, and feeling guilty. It's not his fault I don't have a life, and can't get a job, can't find local friends to go out with, can't convince myself to do enough driving to be ready for my G2 test. Not his fault that I have this fucking disorder which makes me look pretty much only to the negative side of things, especially when he's not around. Hell, I don't even really know why he puts up with me. I don't know how he can actually love me. Especially not if he has an actual girlfriend again that he hasn't the heart to tell me about. I can see where a preference would lie between having someone he can treat like a queen and see on a daily basis-- go places with, have fun with --and me, who's the equivalent of a nagging wife, but&nbsp;in text. He deserves better, but I can't&nbsp;convince myself to let him have better. Which is probably why if, he does have another girlfriend, or never broke up with his other one, he hasn't told me. I mean, aside from adding another crack to my heart, he knows I'm so fucking clingy I wouldn't want to let him go.   Anna's been trying so hard to get me to look at the other good things in life, aside from him. But at this point, there's not much else&nbsp;to look at. Not when you're me, and having to light match after match to see any light when the shadows are closing in. Heh. I'm being melodramatic now, but it's still pretty true.&nbsp; I spend almost every day in front of the computer, or the TV, usually a combination of both. More often am I in front of the TV on days like today when he's not around. I'll talk to Anna for a little while, if she's around when I first sign on. Then usually our conversation dwindles off as she hints at RPing and I, not feeling up to it, don't respond. I might talk to a few others off and on over the hours, pending on who shows up. People I RP with. Sometimes Amy or Bethy or DL. As I&nbsp;fail horribly at holding a conversation unless it has something to do with me or the person needs help, the conversations usually end within an hour. Taylor's usually the only one who'll take interest enough to keep talking to me even after I fall quiet and run out of things to say. That's if he's not busy talking to the swarm of others who IM him, that is, usually.   And there I go again, being unfair to him. *sighs* I never thought I'd say this, but I'm looking forward to therapy. If it can get me out of this crushing way of thinking, then, for the love of everything, strap me to a leather couch and teach me how to change this. I need to start seeing some good in everything, not just Taylor, so that when he's not around, I'm not reduced to this.. this.. whining, angst-ridden, useless lump of flesh, hair, and black clothing. I need to learn how to trust people enough to be the one to initiate being friends with them. I need to stop living this shut-in life style that's making me so bloody miserable. I can't do anything about a job, at least not any more than I have. Part of me feels like I could do something about not having any local friends, though. Maybe they're not all the crack-smoking asshats that I've witnessed so far, because I really haven't made that much of an effort to find out. I've done pretty much all I can to repel them, though. *sighs again*   As for my username on MSN, DL who will be reading this-- that was in reference to my cousin, who's been like my older sister, who told my mom at a wedding shower today not to tell me she's smoking like a chimney again. Given what I've said about today already, that just pushed me over the edge. I don't ask people I care about not to smoke (or drink, for that matter) because I'm trying to ruin their "fun". I ask them not&nbsp;to because I fucking care and don't need or want something terrible happening to them because of it. As I've said in past entries, it's just so bloody senseless.   *sighs* All right. I'm spent. Maybe I'll think of more to edit and add on later, but this seems to pretty well summarize my thoughts today.

      ...does Mother expect me to get a job? (Wow, de ja vu all of a sudden, for whatever reason... Anyway... On to the second rant in two days...) First, we move to a town smaller and crappier than the old one. If we'd remained in Blenheim, I could probably still be working at No Frills (much as I hated it, 'twas money), and have my other summer job back at the Legion, that was cushy and nice. Buuut no, we had to move to freaking Tilbury, where job opportunities are incredibly slim if you're a student. Hell, if you're anybody. There are two grocery stores. I put my resume in at the one some time last month, and am giving in and trying the other tomorrow. I didn't want to work at Zehrs because it reminded me too much of No Frills, but at least with Zehrs there's a chance of me getting into the deli/produce/stock, a.k.a. something that doesn't require an extreme amount of dealing with the general public. Not that I'm  that  anti-social, it's just I had bad experiences working cash with No Frills.  &nbsp;  There's a Tim Horton's. My friend Amy is working at one in Windsor, and advises against my doing the same, as it's extremely stressful and I've recently been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder of sorts.  &nbsp;  There's a Shoppers' Drugmart. That was my first choice for a work place, because it seems fairly quiet in there most of the time. I mean, you're not exactly going to get Friday night rushes at a drug store.  &nbsp;  Bah. I could go on listing the stores, but let me tell ya, there isn't a lot of opportunity. Along with the first grocery store and Shoppers', I dropped my resume off at Home Hardware. None of them have gotten back to me. I sent a resume to the library in Chatham when they were hiring, but got nothing back. Mother didn't even want me to bother applying there, because she didn't feel like driving me/driving with me. Which brings me back to my initial enraged question. I was on the Job Bank for Human Resources Canada, and there are a few jobs that I'm vaguely interested in, ie. I have the credentials they've posted and seem decent enough. But, they're in Chatham and Windsor, or even farther away, and Mom's not willing to drive me/drive with me (fucking G1) so I can get there.  &nbsp;  I need money for college.  &nbsp;  I need to work to get said money.  &nbsp;  I cannot. Get. A. Freaking. Job. In. This. Crap. Hole. Of. A. Town.  &nbsp;  Alright, I guess it's too soon to say that just yet. After all, I still have to put in my application form and resume at Zehrs tomorrow. But hell. If that doesn't work, I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.  &nbsp;  Just to outline how badly I need money, consider the facts. In order to attend the college I really want to get into, the following fees apply for one year:  &nbsp;  Residence: $5000  Tuition: $7475  &nbsp;  So. That's $12, 475, right? Plus they mention an additional $3000-$4000 for "materials and access to specialized facilities" that students "can be expected to spend". Now, this is given that I even get into residence, as they choose who gets in by lottery, and there's room for only 354 students. When there are over 18,000 people at the campus, that just...doesn't seem to be good odds, even given that the majority of that 18,000 are going to be second and third year students who aren't permitted to apply for residence.  &nbsp;  All right. So. I need a fuckload of money. But maybe you're thinking my mom was like responsible parents should be, and set aside a college fund. Welp. She did have one at one point. Now there's about $200 in it, last I heard. And Mom informed me today that she owes over $75,000 for assorted things. &nbsp;On my end, I had to spend around two grand on my laptop last summer because my brother fried the motherboard out of my desktop PC. Now there's about $175 left in my bank account, maybe less.  &nbsp;  Given, there are loans, and scholarships, and financial help like that, but I'd still like to save up as much as I can by working. Plus I really need something to occupy myself with this summer, as I've mentioned already that Tilbury is a crap hole and if I spend many more weeks parked in front of the computer day in, day out,&nbsp;I'm going to bust a nerve.  &nbsp;  ARG.&nbsp;  &nbsp; *pant, pant, soothing breathing* I know I need to go to college to get anywhere in life. Plus, going to college means being closer to Taylor, which is something I really think is going to be good for me, heh. For the both of us. He's looking at going to the same college I am, and to pay his way he's taking the next year and working one if not two jobs. Hell, if I could, I'd be doing the same, but I still have grade twelve to get through. Grade twelve in a whole new school, no less. Grade twelve in a whole new  Catholic  school, with uniforms and the whole shibang, not to mention being forced to take a religion course when I'm presently a pending Wiccan.  &nbsp; Feck. No wonder I'm starting therapy next week. x_x;;; &nbsp; *eyes clock* Now where in the hell is Taylor... I need my pillow...

      After spending the last two hours reading through conversations of the past few&nbsp;months with Taylorkitty, I'm not so inclined to fwap him anymore. We're still going to have words about the drinking thing, but, other than that... &nbsp; I luff my Taylor. *purrr* &nbsp; P.S. In reference to the post title, it is that time of the month, hence I think I'm a bit touchier about the drinking issue than I'd normally be...

      So, I haven't blogged for a while. There's a reason for this-- namely I've developed the superstition that every time I write regularly in these things, bad things start happening in my life in order to provide me with more interesting information to rant on about. Given that certain parts of the two months since the last entry that have been hell, I do realize that I was just being stupid about that.  &nbsp;  Right now, I just need somewhere to mildly explode, since the sources that I usually go to for this either aren't here (Taylor), or have heard it before (Anna). Actually, seeing as it's about Taylor, I really can't dump it on him. Not yet. It's just, he has this friend. I only know her through our shop on Gaia, because he pays her to bump for us. She's what I'm assuming is a fairly wild type. Recently pierced her tongue, has posted frequently about getting wasted and having hangovers, yeah. Last night, there was a party down the street from Taylor's that he went to, and before he left, he told me he wasn't going to do any drinking, since he didn't feel like it, and he knows I really don't approve of it. (I'll get to why in a few paragraphs here.)  &nbsp;  Now, right now, he's gone to an Evanescence concert with his sister and I don't know who else, and won't be back until midnight or so. I recently checked the shop, and found this posted by his friend:  "i just woke up from a lovely 4 hour nap.. remnants of hangover are gone. and -insert his username here-, next time we drink, u are sooo pitching in on booze.lol i have limited funds lately"  &nbsp;  Don't get me wrong. I love him more than anyone, and there are very, very few things that&nbsp;bother me about him. This is number one. I just don't understand why he needs to be&nbsp;drinking. I've always viewed&nbsp;drinking for the sake of getting drunk as something people did when they needed to escape, or to prove God knows what, that they're popular, fuck if I know. It&nbsp;does a number on my respect for him when I find out these things, especially second-hand like this. I just get these images in my head of him acting like an uncontrolled dumbass and then passing out in some unremembered location, and it&nbsp;really bothers me. If he needs to act like an uncontrolled dumbass,&nbsp;he can achieve that just as well on a sugar high, and actually remember it the next morning, without side-effects. *sighs and shakes head a bit*  &nbsp;  Maybe I'm just being stupid about it, but I can't help that it upsets me. Maybe I haven't been around enough drunk folk to have a fair opinion of how people act. What I do recall is&nbsp;my friend Brett's cousin Dan leaning all over me and running into tent poles at her mom's wedding two or three summers back when he was drunk.&nbsp;I just...don't see the point in doing that to yourself. It's idiotic. Social drinking is one thing. Getting hammered several times&nbsp;a month for "fun"&nbsp;is senseless. When he first asked me about how I felt about him drinking, I told him it&nbsp;was all right so long as he didn't drive anywhere after, as I was under the assumption it was something that happened maybe twice a year. Goddess only knows how&nbsp;often he actually does it, now, given what I've recently learned. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  At some point, I might actually let him know all this. I guess the simple knowledge that I don't like it when he goes drinking isn't enough to get him to think about it. I hate being harsh with him. But it's been proven in the past that the only way to get through to him sometimes is to be blunt. *wanders off, mumbling to herself*

      Yeah, bit of a down point again today. I really don't feel like explaining much, though I'll put some points of note: Taylor-- renaissance fair. Taylor-- sent picture of self with new arm bracers and no shirt. Kira-- got first turned on (as always) by his hotness, then depressed by her lack of hotness.  I think that says it all, actually. -_-;  More to the effect of the entry title there... FlamesOfLoss (11:31:34 PM): Just..general negativity...I know he wants to be friends forever, but will he/why would he consider me a girlfriend when/if the circumstances with distance do change... FlamesOfLoss (11:31:56 PM): And why does that matter so much.. Why can't I just be happy to have him as a friend.. WhiteDragon1330 (11:32:36 PM): *smiles* Because he loves you... Anything he'd do for you would be because he loves you. It's as simple as that.  FlamesOfLoss (11:36:45 PM): *smiles a little* WhiteDragon1330 (11:37:27 PM): *gnaws lightly on you and smiles* That's why most guys do things that confuse the girls that care about them. There is no rhyme or reason to love. It just is.  Hneh. Y'know. A few months ago, our positions were almost exactly reversed. DL was the one having doubts, and I was the one giving guy advice. *sweatdrop*
